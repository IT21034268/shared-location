2,Too bitter,I'm amazed no one has mentioned how incredibly bitter this stuff is. It's not sweet at all. It's very tart and bitter. You need a lot of sugar to hide the bitterness. Won't be buying it again.
5,the best for aulus mabele,I RECOMMEND THE OF AULUS MABELE PLUS THE WON I RECOMMAND BEFORE.THANK YOUR TO ACSETE MI RECOMMANDETIONS.
5,Fits nicely in my 03 Camry,Good filter for a good price. It fit perfectly in my 03 Camry and it took less than 5 minutes for the change.
2,NOT FOR A 2003 Toyota Camry!!,Ordered it. Wanted to use it right away for a road trip. it was completely the wrong size.I ended up cutting it up and gluing it into the filter tray.
1,FUNNY SHOW.....HORRIBLE DVD QUALITY,"These discs are made on demand and are as cheap as you can get. There is only 1 home page option and that is play epiosdes and that menu looks like a 3rd grader created it. There are no chapters, if you hit the chapter forward button it will skip to next episode. There are no episode titles or summaries anywhere in the package and the episodes are NOT EVEN IN ORDER!!!!!!!!!!!!! Extremely dissapointed in the packaging of this short lived show I enjoyed."
2,"Great Show, Poor Release","It was good to see Matthew Perry back on weekly series television. Sadly the show did not even last a full season. Happily it did make it to DVD. This DVD release has every episode even those not aired. And I am truly happy to have this show on DVD. What troubles me is the way it was slapped together. I have purchased MOD in the past but have never seen one so poorly produced. There is just one main menu. There is no way to select a specific episode other than hitting play and skipping ahead to the correct episode. There is also no way to jump to the next scene. In the end the quality is something I could have achieved on my home DVR. Very disappointing. But, if you are a fan of the show or Mr. Perry you will be glad to have these episodes in your collection. I rate this series as 5 star but sadly this release is 2 stars at best."
3,Mr. Sunshine is Another Cloud for Perry,"Matthew Perry has been on a run of bad luck since Friends ended. He's been in some good projects like Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip that haven't been given a chance to get their traction and flourish. Mr. Sunshine looked like another good opportunity for Mr. Perry to find some post Friends success. He played Ben Donovan, a self-absorbed manager of a San Diego sports arena. The role was tailor-made for Mr. Perry (it didn't hurt that his production company produced the show) and he played well off the kooky arena owner Crystal played by Allison Janney as well as Crystal's child-like adult son Roman played by the very funny Nate Torrence. Jorge Garcia from Lost guest starred in a few episodes as one of the many arena workers Ben has contempt for. The show only lasted nine episodes. While it did start a little slow it felt like it was starting gain some momentum when ABC pulled it off the air permanently."
3,text book,"This is a book for students. Some fairley good information, has quizes after each chapter. Useful infermation"
1,Waist of money on this book. Feel sorry for myself.,Amazon service was excellent but not happy what I bought for the price and material covered inside this book.I was hoping to see the real furnace parts being shown in trouble shooting.Feel like a dirt after buying this.Hope Amazon takes it back from me and send this book back to the seller.
3,I can't believe there's no online banking support!!!!,"This just blows my mind. My cheapo Quicken (actually bundled free) has had great online banking support for years, but pricey Quickbooks PRO does not? What is that? This is 2005 -- I can't fathom how they could possibly release this product without online banking support. It's not like they don't know how to do it.Other than that I really like it. I'm using it anyway as there isn't really an attractive alternative in my opinion, as they must know..."
1,An absolute joke,"As an Intuit user since 1988 (that's right, 16 years) I simply can't imagine a company that could do a better job of managing an outstanding product into abject failure.Whether Quicken or QuickBooks, Windows or Mac, these products have drifted steadily downhill since 2000. They code is more bloated and bug filled with every new ""release"".QuickBooks 2005 for Mac? Let's see....no Online Banking function; No Payroll Integration. I'll go no further....it's as useful as an Excel program without the ability to calculate cell formulas.Save your money."
3,Not ready for prime time: more is less,"Intuit has hyped this new release a lot, but it falls well short of deserving the praise. The 2005 QuickBooks for Mac would be a definite improvement if there weren't so many little glitches and annoyances in it. Most disturbingly, accounts and numbers pull disappearing acts - they simply don't display on the screen sometimes. How confidant can you feel when you're looking at a Profit and Loss statement that has no numbers on it?Even though the menus are touted as being redesigned to closely match those in the PC version of QuickBooks, some things are still maddeningly hard to find. And too many basic features are still unavailable. Intuit should have kept this under wraps a bit longer and made sure it worked before they foisted it off on users eager for an improved product. Let's hope they address the bugs promptly in a maintenance update."
1,Not as advertised:MAC to PC problems.,"If you are planning on round-tripping between your Mac and a Windows version (i.e. between your accountant or bookeeper's PC using a windows version of Quickbooks Pro- DO NOT PURCHASE this product! Unfortunately, there are two major flaws with Quickbooks 2005 7.0. The first and most dangerous is that the more you round trip the more corrupt your data will become. Secondly, if you have memorized reports you will have to errase them before round tripping and they will not be saved.Unfortunately Quickbooks does not tell you this before purchasing- infact they advertise this easy conversion between Mac and PC as a selling feature for their product.If you do not need to have your accountant or CPA manipulate your data on their PC, then the program is a good attempt to make a Windows style program into a MAC-like product."
1,Terrible Software,"This new version is a complete joke if you need an accountant to check things over and make changes. Unlike the windows version, the mac version cannot create an accountants copy. This means that you can't make any changes to the file (like add new entries) until you get the revised file back from your account. In contrast, the windows version has had the ability to do accountants copies for years. This alone makes the program borderline useless in my opinion."
4,Nice bit of software for a PPC Mac easy to use,"I have a mini mac power pc so any software after 2009 won't work on my mac, I got hold of this old copy of quick books and it works fine, easy to use. Its missing a few extras that they have added on quick books 2012, but it's got everything I need to run my small buisiness, it's an American version and I'm from the uk, so I had to put a fake USA phone number in to register it online, other than that it works fine for a uk user."
2,Intuit support was a joke,"I had problems setting up the windows version of this program. When I called support, all the guy wanted to do was sell me an extra support plan. He wasn't even interested in hearing my question.The program is easy to use, but is very limited in functions. Also, no multiple currencies: something I need.MYOB supports multiple currencies but that program is a huge headache.While the Windows version of Quickbooks is a really solid program, the Mac version is week.I recommend checking the apple download page. There are many free or extremely cheap programs with similar programs to this quickbooks."
4,A LESSON REGARDING THE CARE OF OUR EARTH,"A tiny tree mouse stands her ground when trees in the forest are flattened by a gigantic bulldozer. At last, sensing the fright on the faces of the animals, the driver of the bulldozer leaves and the woods are again at peace.This author's marvelous animal art and meaningful storyline sends an important message regarding the care of our earth.Young readers will learn and also find themselves rooting for the survival of their new animal friends."
1,Disappointing,"This pot is very thin. It dents very easily. It became dented and slightly warped early in its usage. The lid is sometimes difficult to lock and you can easily find yourself accidentally dumping your spaghetti in the sink.The biggest problem I have with it is that the coating comes off. I do not want that in my food. Once the coating comes off, the bare spots inside began to rust. To the trash!"
2,"Hey Mr or Ms Not Helpful!,","This is a pretty good product if your interested but very flimsy. That is why, even though I get good use out of it, I couldn't recommend it."
1,Did they pay people to review this book?,"Read this book - and with no apathy towards the authors - so what? Nothing new. Same stories, same info has been presented by George S. Day, David A. Aaker, and many others. Having worked with the authors in the past, I say this. There is nothing unique or special about their process. Its not rocket science. There are better, more detailed books about this subject - choose them."
5,Very practical and easy to implment,One of the most practical book which I have read. Defintely Paul Strebel has put to gether an excellent book from well-known authors who have wealth of practical knowledge on the topics. It easily can be distinguished that what authors writing are from their solid and in-depth experinces in the field. I highly recommend this book to those who have some experinces in the field and need new practical guidelines to move their organization/team into this 21st century industrial-informational arena.
3,At times a bit cheesy,"The concept behind the book is well-imagined. The photos do, at times, live up to the idea that inspires them -- athletes from Greek and Roman times, carved into marble for all eternity. Unfortunately, this collection of photographs won't perhaps stand the test of time, but some are stunning and other make you blush. With that, it makes a fantastic coffee table book that is sure to catch the eyes of all and definitely a few giggles. ;)"
2,not what was expected,"this is a great book, the only problem was the seller didnt mention the outer cover wear and many of the inside pages were dog-eared."
3,Very few real nudes; they cover their genitals!,"There are 82 pictures in the book (and an additional 2 pictures on the cover).Of those 82 pictures 13 of them show full frontal nudity. In most pictures, however, the model covers his genitals with his hand.The models look good for the most part. Their age seems to be in the late twenties. They are well-worked with a lot of muscles. Whether that is beautiful or not, depends on the reader. In my opinion there are only few beautiful models in the book.If you prefer to look at naked males, who cover up their genitals then this book would be right for you. If you prefer to see it all in nude pictures then do not buy this book!"
3,Accurately depicted,"This pendant was accurately depicted both visually and in description, seemed well-constructed. Received as stated. More than I would normally pay as a wholesale buyer and jewelry creator. Overall, satisfied with this item."
5,A Minor Classic,"Frankie Lee finally had an LP released under his name in 1984 on the Hightone Label. The album leans more towards soul than Lee's later releases. Notable songs include ""The Ladies and the Babies"", a humorous tale of a one night stand gone wrong penned by soul veteran Jimmy Lewis, the country-ish ballad ""Don't Make Me Go Home"", and the party-rocker ""Lu Ann"". Lee shows his more serious side on downbeat tracks like ""The Woman Don't Live Here No More"", the deep blues ""Face It"", and the socially aware ""It's Cold Out Here"". While Lee doesn't have the strongest voice around, his vocal's are great on every track and he definitely deserves to have more than 4 albums under his name."
1,What is this schlock?,"My first and last impression of this movies was that they fired the editors, it was patched together cliche humor with totally unrealistic scenarios that leave you thinking just what the hell the producers were thinking when they green lighted this terd. Stay away from this movie, you want something this painful just shoot yourself in the foot."
1,"possibly the worst film, ever","This movie is repulsive in every way. Possibly the worst thing to happen to otherwise talented actors Norm MacDonald and Danny DeVito. I have nothing against rude boildy humors. I had a good laugh watching movies such as ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""American Pie"". If the entire movie ia centered around fart jokes, at least do them right.... The movie failed to grasp the concept of funny and confused comical exaggeration with plain lameness.... This movie should be only funny for people who have lowered their expectations to the point of unconsciousness. As bad as it is, this movie has the ironic potentials to be a cult classic in the future. When something gets this bad and this unpopular, it'll come back and embraced by the cultural cultists."
5,The only thing screwed about this movie...,"...is that it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. If your a fan of comedies such as Meet the Parents (Yawn!), Scary Movie* (In the name of all that is good and deacent, get it away!), and Big Daddy (Burn the TV and VCR! They've both been befouled!), then this isn't the movie for you. If you are a fan of the comedic styles of the Three Stooges, the late Chris Farley, and, of course, Norm MacDonald, then this is the movie to watch. It started out as a better version of Lost & Found and evolved into it's own movie. Take my advice, the scene where Norm get's muged by those two little kids is well worth watching the movie. I'm still trying to view a copy of Dirty Work, I havn't seen it yet and I want to! This is a good example of how great a Norm MacDonald movie can be.*I'm well aware of how bad of an example Scary Movie is, but it's a great example of how unfunny a movie can get if you take this type of humor too far."
2,Not What I Expected...,"With the line up of funny guys in this movie I expected to be laughing all the way through. Well, it didn't turn out to be as funny as I thought. I think I laughed ONE time, when Danny Devito's character noticed all the wanted signs with his face on them....that was it as far as laugh out loud funny in my opinion. Norm McDonald is not at his comedic best in this movie. Rent it don't buy it is my best advice!"
4,"Not Side-Splitting Humor, But Amusing Nonetheless....","I found this movie to be quite humorous, but I was not rolling on the floor laughing. This movie is a classic example of what can happen when even the best laid plans go wrong (despite how crazy these plans are to the rational thinking person!) and the consequences that one must face afterwards. The reason I watch movies is to escape reality for a little while...movies often take the normal & turn it into a fabricated, distorted, even warped version of reality and I believe that's what makes movies fun. This movie will be no fun if the viewer nit-picks and criticizes how unrealistic the plot is. The plot of this film does teeter on the verge of crazy & unrealistic, but that is why it is a movie and that is why Hollywood is so successful."
4,"Great movie, great cast, great laughs",Yo this is the dopest movie i have seen in a long time. This is the type of movie you can watch over and over again. None stop laughs and great comic relief by all three stars. I will not spoil any more of this movie for you just check it out and if u like cop it.
5,highlarious,"this movie is like the funniest movie i've ever seen.Norm Macdonald and Dave chapelle are funny. Trust me this movie is funnier than ""Dirty Work"", and way wayyyyyyy funnier than Litte Nicky i promise. That movie sucked."
3,Kinda Funny,"This is one of those movies that is very weird and easily shows that it is a movie. There are very few areas where one feels like it isn't a movie that they are watching. THe actors do some really dumb stuff that in some ways is not funny at all. However, the highlight of the movie is the 75 year old veteran Elaine Stritch who steals the show. SHe is so funny and it is refreshing to see an older lady both leading and being able to have a spotlighting role. She is funny as the cantankerous and hot-tempered millionaire who has her dog kidnapped for ransom by her chaffeur/butler, etc only for the dog to return. Then there are alot of subsequent twists in which you would have to buy the movie to see and underdtand and enjoy. This is a pretty good movie."
3,Good Movie.,"This movie is only worth one watch. That is, unless you really love it. Then yeah, it's worth only one watch. This movie is funny every one in a while. So o and see it. What the heck? Right?"
1,Bomb,"Brought this for my mum my sister and her loved it, I thought it left me wondering... why? I just thought it wasn't so funny..."
4,"""Screwed"" movie","I bought this for my wife, it was an old favorite of hers and I have have not seen it, but she seems happy about it. New package and DVD, all went well with the purchase and shipment."
4,I liked the Finesse Bodifying Shampoo. My hair ...,"I liked the Finesse Bodifying Shampoo. My hair is fine and thinning. The shampoo gave my hair volume, body, and made it feel thicker. The only thing that could be improved upon is to add a conditioner that would leave the hair shiny. I'd recommend this product to anyone who has fine or thinning hair."
4,I love this product. It has a great ...,"I love this product. It has a great scent that lingers and leaves your hair shiny and full of bounce. The reason I didn't give it a perfect score is that I prefer a shampoo and conditioner in one. It saves me time. But all in all, I'd highly recommend this product!"
3,Disappointed,"After reading all the other reviews I have to say mine did not measure up to their comments. Was definately not packed the way others described, dirt all over the place and the pitchers all tangled up. I think it will survive though so don't regret the purchase."
3,Comentario,"Llego el disco pero en un empaque de envio de mala calidad, se rompio el plastico que protege el disco."
2,Esta bien pero su salsa esta caliente.,"Termine de oir este album. No me agara como su salsa. Le quiero preguntar a Luis Enrique porque no hace un album de salsa. La salsa que me hizo mover, sentir, feliz. Extrano su salsa erotica. Aunque este album le vaja bien, el tendra mas exito con salsa, lo que le dio su fama. Su amiga Angie de Orlando."
5,Well-organized history,"To me this history of before and after the 1620 stop at Plymouth including ""King Philip's War"" was well worth the read. As with most histories, it could be at times slow going but also was sometimes spellbindingly written, verging on a good novel. However, that is only to say that most of the time a purely academic book of this length comes off as prosaic and pedantic in exponential extremes. This work was highly readable, enlivened by personal characteristics and backgrounds of the main players. Philbrick did an excellent job of pulling together many sources and keeping a focus."
5,A must read!,"As a teacher of History here in Massachusetts I naturally gravitated toward this book. Yet, I must insist that it far exceeded my expectations. Philbrick's research has been so extensive that he has brought the players back to life. Moreover, his writing style carries one through the text as though it may be a 'beach novel.' (That observation is for those who may consider historical reads 'boring'). Mayflower is by no means a bore. Any reader that has ever been curious about our nation's early development, why we became who we are, or, if one simply loves Thanksgiving as a holiday must read this book. Perfectly researched, perfectly written, and a perfect satisfaction to all our colonial curiousities."
2,boring....where is the ship?,A bit miss leading. The Mayflower the ship is done with and the voyage over within the first CD (I listened to the audio disc). Then it is on to some interesting reports about the set up of Plymouth. However by then end of the book it breaks down to various wars just this Indian tribe vs. this Indian tribe. The result gets well really boring and a bit confusing. There is good history here just not compiling reading like his past book.
3,pretty good,"I enjoyed this book. It is a good read in relation to the Pilgrims. It brings the reader from their struggle getting to Plymouth up until the early 18th century. However, the book lacks information on the day to day lives of the Pilgrims. Another issue is the fact that there are so many Native American Tribes that the reader gets confused as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. Also, the book tend to lacks some feeling. But overall it's a pretty good read"
2,1/2 Mayflower 1/2 King Phillip,"As I read this book, I became startled when I noticed the key Pilgrims started dying off around page 150 or so. Brewster, Bradford, Standish... all wiped out to make room for King Phillip... who is really the star of this story. The title of this book gets little coverage compared to the war that came fifty years or so later. It's a great history, and the author knows his stuff, but the book only briefly covers the subject that I at least hoped to read about. I'm also annoyed at the constant comparisons the author makes to claim it was one of the deadliest wars in American history based on the percentage of casualties. If he's so concerned with bringing that event into view, he should have started with naming the book with a more appropriate title."
5,A new slant on the Pilgrims and other issues ofs the fabeled past,"This book gives a good and down to earth view of the issue of early English settlers. Somewhat disconcerting when it is relized that all the folks at that time bought and sold the Indians, stole their food and then nearly wiped them out.The fact that New England had been visited many times before and hordes of fishing ships worked the cod banks for nearly a hundred years before the first permanent settlement was an enlightening thing for me. All and all a pretty unsaory bunch, not at all the same folks I learned about years ago. A must read for anyone truly interested in early Americana. And willing to face reality."
3,mayflower,Well researched. First half of book was interesting and informative. Second half seemed almost redundant with continuing Indian battles. Consequently added labor to reading and following. More like a history textbook than a novel.
2,Factually incorrect,"Contrary to the myth that Philbrick puts forth, the landing of the Mayflower was not the beginning of the United States -- that honor would go to the Lost Colony in North Carolina and to the settlement of Jamestowne in 1607 by some very courageous individuals, long before the Mayflower set sail. Likewise it has been documented that the first Thanksgiving did not take place with the Pilgrims; it took place around 1607 along the James River (then called Fluvanna River) in what became the Colony of Virginia. The site for that first Thanksgiving is believed to be on the property of what is known as the Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia, just up river from the Jamestowne Settlement. I hate to think what other myths are being perpetuated by these gross historical inaccurancies and flights of fantasy."
4,The Good Guys Lost,"I must take issue with the primary ""unfavorable"" review. I found ""The Mayflower"" interesting and well-written but extremely depressing, because the good guys (the Native Americans) lost. U.S. policies of aggressive war have a long history."
5,Detailed and entertaining,"Nathanial Philbrick's Mayflower is a well researched and written book about the Puritans who landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. The book does not stop there. It details the trials and tribulations of these colonists who befriend and then turn against the Native Americans. Much of the book deals with the little known French and Indian War as well as the impact it had on the formation of the New England Colonies. The author not only covers the topic, but shows both the positive interaction of the Puritans with the Native Americans as well as the typical European abuse of the same people. Philbrick takes a decidedly dry topic and breathes life into it with entertaining points rarely discussed outside of upper academia. His attention to detail and depth make Mayflower a necessary read for anyone interested in early colonial history. This work can be used as an introduction as well as a supplement to more broad works on the topic. Well worth the time."
4,Great Book,"This books paints a picture of the early life of the pilgrams. It will make you appreciate all the hardships the early settlers went through. They died like flies in the first few years. The second half is a great History of the early relations and war with the Native Americans. Lots of killing on both sides. Overall I found the book very interesting, well written, engaging, and made me appreciate the comforts that we have at present day."
3,a savage history,"Fascinating first half that makes for highly recommended reading. I felt educated and filled with wonderment how the english settlers facing danger and diesese at every turn, relied on their faith and perservered to allow later generations to prosper in New England and beyond. The second half of this book outlined the wars with Indians and was hard for this reader to handle. I think it makes me believe that war is always a condition of man. Especially when higher spirtual ideas are set aside. Even the Indians were in war with other Indians before the english got here. It seems to me, so much bloodshed could have been avoided if cooler heads were left to govern. Something that's so relevant today. Very eye opening and very sad to a large degree."
4,A good history book,"This is a fine historical treatise on King Phillip's war against the American Indians, a subject not well known to even historians. Along the way we become familiar with the passengers of the Mayflower, the miracle of their journey, and their notions of ""normalcy"". Looking back on their customs, their harsh and exclusive religious views, their coinage of unique names such as Marcia Makepeace, and their definition of love, gives one a first hand look at America's first pioneers and the Indians they displaced."
5,Gripping,"This book is written in a very fluid and engaging style, one of the best pieces of writing I've seen on the subject of U.S. History. The reader will have no trouble breezing through the pages in this book and enjoying every minute of it. The title is a bit misleading, as the book has more to do with the complete history of the Plymouth colony than the ship that brought the colonists over, but no matter. The conclusion the author comes to, of trying to find a moral to the story in Benjamin Church, is a rather silly contemporary tacking on to the narrative, but oh well; there has to be a conclusion, right? The book is an excellent read, told in up-to-date modern language that will be sure to please anyone looking for a good story."
5,Fascinating,"This story is one of the many titles I have read by Nathaniel Philbrick. Every time I read one of his books, I feel as if I have been awakened to important historical details I should have been taught in high school. I think his notes section is every bit as fascinating as the stories that led me to the end of the book. I can't wait to read his next book."
4,"Not what I expected, but","the book was still a captivating piece of literature. I read this directly after reading In the Heart of the Sea by Philbrick, and was expecting the same type of story. That was not the case however. The title is a bit misleading in that one thinks they are going to be reading (or at least I did) a story of the journey. The subtitle should have cued me in. The book is about the struggle between the settlers and the natives more so than it is about the voyage to the new world. All that being said, I still loved the book. I gave the book four stars because I wish there was more about the actual voyage, and I think the title is a little misleading. All in all though, it is a superb piece of literature."
4,Not what half expected,"I was afraid that this would a piece of ancestor-bashing revisionist history trash -- I was, happily, wrong. I read this in order to determine whether or not I wanted to assign is as a reading for a class I teach, and I was impressed with its, overall, balanced approach, readability, and comprehensiveness for what the book sought to accomplish."
4,Great look at the start of Colonial America,The Mayflower provides an interesting look at one of the most interesting times in American History. While the discussion of the overseas voyage and early colonization is interesting the second half of the book is where the real action lies. The description of King Philips war and Indian relations is fascinating and shows an excellent template for the future of American history. Philbrick even handily deals with all of the actors involved and provides a very interesting viewpoint for further reading. If you know nothing about this time period as I did when I read this it is an excellent book to start with.
3,Mayflower?,"I would have liked more of the book to be about the story of the Pilgrims themselves. Philbrick merely retells (for the most part) what is already available in Bradford's ""Of Plimoth Plantation"" which, of course, is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject of the Pilgrims. As for King Philip's War, Jill Lepore wrote a great book about this in 1998 called ""The Name of War: King Philip's War and the Origins of American Identity."" I for one was disappointed in Philbrick's book. I'd hoped for more insight. He doesn't reveal anything new, but I'll be happy if his book helps to make the general public aware of the complexity of the lives of the early New England settlers."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in Nathaniel Philbrick's Mayflower. Philbrick writes very clear prose and his portrayal of Benjamin Church, ""King Philip"" and other Pilgrims and Indians are well wrought. My disappointment was with the subject matter. A great share of the book is a blow by blow, battle by battle, rendition of King Philip's War, between the Pilgrims and some of their Indian neighbors. If you enjoy well-written battle stories took even-handedly you will be impressed. If you are hoping for about the ""community"" than the war you, too, will be disappointed."
5,Couldn't put this down!,"In school, history was my worst subject. However, I found this book by Philbrick to be a very interesting and vivid account of the first decades of our country. His re-telling of the Pilgrim's crossing - where I felt I was on the Mayflower - to the fear and concern of the first few weeks and months in the new world were gripping. I knew nothing of the Indians' history and was fascinated by the relationship with the Puritans and new settlers. Strongly recommend this book!"
3,",mayflower",I got the book in a timely manner and it was in great condition just like the owner said it would be. I will buy books from this place again if they have what I'm looking for.
5,Couldn't put it down . . .,"My husband bought this book while we ""westerners"" were in Massachusetts on an American History trip with our 16-year-old granddaughter. I was relegated to the back seat of the car because I am ""directionally challenged"" in all things GPS and I picked up the book when the battery on my Kindle died. I could NOT stop reading. It made a story I had heard all my life so REAL. I think I irritated my front seat companions by my constant ""listen to this"" moments. It is a readable, engaging book and all lovers of American History should read it."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I couldn't get into this book because it was very different from what I thought it would be. I expected ""Mayflower"" to be a detailed account of why the pilgrims decided to journey to America, and also a vivid description of what life aboard the Mayflower was actually like. The book did cover those things, but only for a few short pages. Most of the book is devoted to the history of Plymouth Colony and King Philip's War. Author Nataniel Philbrick does an excellent job of shooting down the myths many people believe about what the pilgrim settlement was actually like, but I was much more interested in reading about the actual Mayflower journey and was disappointed that so little information about that event was included in this 400+ page book. ""Mayflower"" should be called ""King Philip's War"" so readers know what they're getting into."
2,Not a definitive piece of work,"Someone else will have to write ""the"" Mayflower book as this author just didn't get it.Philbrick refers to the Pilgrims as ""Puritans"" a name they not only didn't use, but eschewed. Indeed it was the invasion of Puritans beginning in 1629 as they settled their ""Massachusetts Bay Colony"" adjacent to Plymouth (`Plimoth') that motivated members of the original colony to move on and settle Connecticut, largely to escape from the dreaded Puritans.No mention of the Rev John Lo/Lathop - a major figure and an unforgivable oversight."
2,"TOO MANY ""CHARACTERS""","Ok, I will be the descending view on this novel. I went into this book hoping to further educate myself about the pilgrims, native americans and the trials and tribulations of their time. While I did find bits and pieces of what I was seeking, it was surrounded by SO MANY indian names, tribe names,colonists names, their lineage the towns they founded that I found myself lost. This is not a book for someone with little background about this time period. The author mentions people as if the reader should already know who some of them are. I am not a historian and was truly trying to further educate myself. Unfortunaly I came away frustrated. The author knows his ""stuff"" and the book is extremely well researched. Unfortuntly the author felt the need to put in EVERY DETAIL of his research. TOO MUCH FOR THIS READER! While I did not expect a ""dumbed down"" version of history--it would have been nice to focus the information a bit...."
2,"Mayflower: A story of Courage, community and War",There's something gratifying in realizing that your ancestors were just as downright boring and terrorizing as we are.
1,History book?,"I thought that this book was very dull and was not at all what I expected. The only thing about the Mayflower in this is the first few chapters. The majority of the book is what happened after they landed and is really written as a history book so unless that is what you're looking for, don't get this (if you are looking for something exciting)."
3,Mayflower: A Story of Courage...,I usually like historical non-fiction but this was just too wordy; a timeline would have worked just as well.
2,"""What???""",Not to be considered historically correct. Information quoted as fact when it has not been proven to be so.
3,Misnomer,Readers expecting to hear much about the Mayflower and life in Plymouth will be diappointed. The focus of the book is more on relations between all the colonies and the Native American tribes over an extended period of time. The book is well researched and covers a topic that certainly can use more careful inspection.
5,"Great, Great Book!","Being from the Boston area, one cannot escape the legend that is the Mayflower. Yet, Mr. Philbrick's narrative brings the reader close-up to the struggles these brave people faced, not only when they crossed the North Atlantic, but the problems they faced when they came ashore.As an American History Teacher, this is probably the best book on the subject I have read. A terrific read!"
4,What You Don't Know,"Nathaniel Philbrick gives the reader an in-depth history of Plymouth Colony. It is truly amazing what we don't know about this part of our heritage and what we are not taught in school. Mr. Philbrick brings history book characters to life, giving them personalities and feelings. I was especially impressed by his investigation into the native population of the area, King Phillip's War and the tribal interaction. It was a very informative read."
2,Hard to stay interested,To me the book concentrated much more on the various Indian tribes and not enough on the passengers of the Mayflower. If you are interested in the History of New England Indian tribes this book is for you.
4,Interesting,"This is a good read. It's full of interesting facts and it corrects a lot of the myths that we have believed about the pilgrims on Plymouth Rock. Not recommended for the casual reader. Also, have your dictionary handy while reading this book."
3,Mild Disappointment,"I really enjoyed Philbrick's Heart of the Sea and The Last Stand, but just couldn't get into this book. And, I don't really know why. I did learn a lot about a period of history of which I knew little, and I developed a real respect for the Pilgirms, et. al, who sufferred to found the country. And, as usual there were the usual number of atrocities against the Indians. However, they were a pretty tough bunch also. I stopped reading with about a hundred pages left becuase I found it was kind of like plowing ground. Maybe there were too many characters, too many battles that sounded pretty much the same, or too many Indian names I could not keep straight. Maybe it was the author's writing which was a bit too journalistic. I did think the author went on a bit about just how important Kng Phillip's War was when in most instances the warring groups numbered in the tens, not thousands. Anyway, I did not find this to be an enjoyable read at all."
5,Great book in great shape!,Got it for cheap money and didn't realize it was hardcover. Nice!Summer reading book and actually very enjoyable.
3,So you think you know about the pilgrims? Ha!,"Wow, these are not the pilgrims that we learned about in third grade. What an eye-opening account. But this book is not a fast, easy read. It's very textbook-y.Nevertheless, it made for a great book club discussion!"
2,Misnamed and Disappointing,"Some of the reviewers have recommended this book for teenagers. I say, 'Good luck on that!' To me, history is a living entity - as real to me as, well, myself - and Philbrick made it dry as dust. No teenager would read beyond two chapters. 'Mayflower' is not, in fact, about the Mayflower, as has been pointed out; it is about King Philip's war and the colonists. I suspect, however, if Philbrick had used an accurate title, sales would have been much smaller. I finally started scanning pages looking for the meat. Didn't find a lot. Just got older and didn't add to my meager supply of wisdom."
3,Title Is Deceiving,"The book is mostly about the New England Indians of the 17th Century, culminating in King Phillip's War. The Mayflower, its passengers and their progeny, are not a large part of the story. The inappropriate book title was obviously selected to dupe Mayflower enthusiasts to buy this book about Indians. If you are looking for a book about the New England Indians of the period, it is moderately interesting and informative. About the Mayflower, it is not. It should have been titled with words more descriptive of the content."
3,large print book for my father,"I can't actually review the book itself, since it was a gift, and I haven't read it. I ordered it specifically for my dad who is having difficulty reading while awaiting cataract surgery. The book did arrive quickly and safely."
3,somewhat disappointing,this is a good secular history of the Mayflower and the pilgrims. It is hard to understand how anyone can write a history of a group for whom religion played such an important role and give so little attention to that religion. While theology was important to the pilgrims it obviously is unimportant to the author. Some excellent information and treatment. Also fails to make the connection with the Kennebec river.
2,Mayflower,The subject matter is enormously interesting but it is presented in a dull manner and could have been written in a far more interesting and engaging manner.
5,Disturbingly mis-titled book.,"But a wonderful book. As stated by many, MAYFLOWER should've been titled KING PHILIP'S WAR or PLYMOUTH, and mostly concerns the Indian Wars of the mid/late 17th century. This didn't bother me, as I was interested in the Mayflower, but through the process of reading it I became interested in the wars that took place.A great, fast paced and interesting piece of Non Fiction."
3,Don't be mislead by the title...,"I read this author's other book ""Into the Sea"" and found it an incredible page turner. Wanting more of the same, I was drawn to ""Mayflower"" thinking it would be a day-by-day chronicle of life aboard the ship. Much to my surprise, the Mayflower lands by page 70 and is barely mentioned again. What follows is a detailed and engrossing story of survival in the new land which holds your interest for quite a while. But once the Plymouth colony is established, the book becomes very sprawling and a lot harder to follow. Instead of staying with a small cast of characters, you're bouncing up and down the coast. If you're looking for the ""story of courage"" advertised in the subhead of the book, you might be a little let down after 200 pages or so...."
4,Good Historical Fiction,Really enjoyed the fictional perspective on the happenings around the Mayflower times. Recommend it to history buffs interested in this period.
3,Details of the first English colonizers,The author has a lot of detail here and its evident that he had to track thru diaries of a lot of people from that time. There are two problems with this book--the images are not good enough. There should have been more photos of the remnants of the forts and some artwork/diagrams of the mayflower boat. Also--there is too much details of the fights/skirmishes between the Indian tribes and the colonizers. Its repetitive after a while.
4,Give it back to the Indians!,Philbrick has done another superb job in researching a little-known time and event. I read a review that said he spent too little time on the actual crossing of the Mayflower and hence I almost did not get this book. I am very glad I did purchase and read it. How little we all really know or can even imagine of the hardships faced by the brave Pilgrims. And how little we knew of the fate that befell the Native Americans. Both a heartbreaking and heartwarming book and I recommend it to any and all Americans.
4,Good Book,This book is very informative. I love history when it's presented in a narrative form instead of just one dry fact after another.
3,P.C. VERSION OF HISTORY MAKES GOOD ADVENTURE READING,"Philbrick uses copious research and stellar writing to provide a fast adventure treat for those who either do not believe, or do not care that today's P.C. rules determine that the ""White Man"" is/was always wrong. His knowledge of the era seems sound and I cannotchallenge that, but his understanding of God[ he always employs the lower case""god"" to stay in line with the P.C. mandate and the ""Elect""[ which is not P.C. at all,because it means those PREDESTINED to go to Heaven ] is wavering and largely inadequate;still the book is worth a bargain or used price[ if you buy it for $39.95, you'll feel like you paid too much for only a fair product.]"
2,"Pilgrims & Indians good, Philbrick awful","Philbrick takes the cherished American creation story and does wonders with it, bringing together an abundance of original sources, and compiling them in a way that lets the original actors tell an enchanting tale, often in their own words. In this case, the real story is vastly superior to the myths and legends told in classrooms everywhere around Thanksgiving time. Full of struggle and drama, triumph and failure, victory and defeat, uncommon valor and common foibles, of two cultures overcoming chasms to build bonds and bridged, just to see human bungling bring them crashing down again.And then there is Phibrick's postmodernist interpretation and commentary. Though only about 10% of the content, it's so painfully awkward and out of place it manages to spoil the great work and words of the Indians and Pilgrims of real history."
4,DC Harvard Alums Book Club recommends The Mayflower,"A smoothly written, extensively researched, and well-paced book chock full of big personalities and fascinating details. We all agreed that we learned many interesting facts about both the passengers on the Mayflower and the Native Americans, such as the role of women sachems and the true meaning of pow wow. It gives you a whole new take on this chapter in history. Most of us knew little about King Phillip's War prior to this reading. Some complained that there was too much military strategy while others quite enjoyed those sections and the discovery that the Native Americans may have invented guerrilla warfare tactics. Great maps, illustrations, endnotes, and bibliography."
5,A great story of the new world,"Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War is a history of the Plymouth colony. It also tells the story of the Wampanoag tribes and their precarious situation when the settlers arrived. The two cultures had their ""first"" thanksgiving, and lived in peace for over 50 years before the world turned upside down for both.In short, Mayflower is a terrific story about early America and the loss of great promise. Philbrick does a great job of making the characters human and believable."
5,Riveting; couldn't put it down,"Philbrick has the ability to write histories that not only inform, but that bring people to life in such a way that you think you're reading a novel. This particular history covers a period often glossed over in US history; the period after the Pilgrims landed. What makes it unique is its focus on the relationships between the Pilgrims/Puritans (Philbrick differentiates between the two) and the native population. Although it covers the conflicts it also covers the dynamic of how the two peoples coexisted in peace and how the leaders of both groups learned to work together. Unfortunately as increased immigration from England put pressure on Indian lands the coalitions and cooperation that had maintained the peace for 50 years fell apart leading to ""King Phillip's War."" Again, what makes this book worthwhile is that it doesn't just focus on war itself but on how diplomatic relations between the two peoples were carried out during war and peace."
4,Mayflower,This true story is one that takes you through the very being of what America was like in the 1600's. It tells of how hard those people had it and how much they needed the American Indian to make it thru the winters and we all no where it went from there.... land grabing !! Great book and written so that an 8th grader could read & understand everything going on.
2,returned,"I returned this item. Did not like it. Thought it looked ""cheap"" and would not give it for a gift."
5,Great,Great price quality product fast shipping! Love how it fits so many pictures!! There are places to put notes next to the picture too
5,I now see pigs in a whole new light...,"I love this movie. Lots of action, but not in the usual formulaic way, great characters, perfect actors for the parts, and it's really, REALLY funny. Brad Pitt does a great job as Mickey, and Bullet Tooth Tony is awesome. If you like action and/or British movies give this one a try. Guy Ritchie is, for the most part, a good director. Now if we can just keep Madonna from influencing any more of his movie making decisions, lest we be subjected to another ""Swept Away""..."
5,Great Movie,If you liked the movie on the silver screen youll love it on your personal little black screen. I dont recomend buying it unless youve seen it though.
3,fast paced,Brit gangster flick with surprises and a grey overcast tint. Brad Pitt was great as the whacked out boxer with the golden fist. Very stylish and funny.
4,* Weird But Good,"What an off the wall, strange thing this movie was! A lot like Fight Club (which I'd rate with 5 stars) ... funny, low grade British comedy with an unusually good Brad Pitt -- and thank goodness his role is small!"
5,Hysterically funny,"I seem to be in the minority as I actually preferred Snatch to Lock, Stock, n' Two Smoking Barrels. The plot breezes along at a million miles an hour, but it is entirely secondary to the characters, who are well fleshed out and uniformly funny. It's been said before, but Brad Pitt really does steal the show as an incomprehensible, undefeatable Gypsy boxer."
5,What a blast!,"This movie is a gem. Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.Ok guys (the sub 3 star reviewers that take issue with the plot), so the plot isn't exactly groundbreaking ""Diamond is stolen by sophisticated group, stolen from the thiefs by unsophisticated group of thieves...."". It's not meant to be ""heavy"", it's meant to be fun......and fun it is. Every character could be a book unto themselves...hyper animated, colorful beyond belief. The dialogue between them is world class.Then there's the music...fantastic blend of Euro-contemporary and Old School Rock.I highly recommend."
2,Nah not worth the money,This movie could not keep my attentionIt was OK at times but did not contain a great story line
5,Wonderfully Entertaining!!,"Make certain to have the words expressed on the bottom of the screen as Brad has a very convincing accent and it is almost impossible to understand his gypsy Irish words. This is a funny, mature, entertaining movie. Love the all-star cast and the unusual twists that the story takes!! Good addition to our library!!"
4,Guy Ritchie is the Tarantino of the UK.,"Words can't exactly describe this film so perhaps this will sum it up: cockney criminals, underground boxing, and a big juicy diamond.Vinnie Jones & (the incredible) Jason Statham from ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" return and Hollywood top dogs Benicio Del Toro & Brad Pitt join the cast. Pitt (who once again is swinging his fists as he did in ""Fight Club"") is hysterical as Mickey the mumbling Irish gypsy. Word to the wise: before starting the movie, go to the subtitle options and select ""Pikey, what did you say"" so you can understand what Pitt is saying through his jumbled speech.""Smoking Barrels"" was great but ""Snatch"" blows that movie out of the water. It has more action, more humor, a surprise ending and of course, a terrific cast. I love watching British crime & caper/action films and ""Snatch"" is one of the best to cross the pond."
5,Sam,"I love this movie. Just reading it without seeing it on the back of some dvd case -You wouldn't think much of it. In my opinion,this is one of the greatest movies I've seen in a long time."
4,Fast Paced Action Flick!,"This Movie is cool, more than cool it's fresh, it has a great direction. Even tought I've heard it's very similar to ""Lock, Stock..."" also from Guy Ritchie, I haven't seen that last one. Anyway... this DVD has a few featurettes, deleted scenes and the very welcomed ""pikey"" subtitle option (used when Brad Pitt's character speaks). It even has an option where you can play the deleted scenes where they were suposed to be (even tough the deleted scenes look horrible) my only complaint would be its lack of spanish subtitles. Again the R4 edition is a Single Disc Edition and I don't think it has all the extras this one has."
4,"Lock, Stock and THREE Smoking Barrels","Three smoking barrels is what Guy Ritchie said he hoped this movie wouldn't be. Well... It is. Fortunately for him I liked Lock-Stock, and I think Snatch is actually a slightly better movie. If you like complex interweaving story-lines, then Guy Ritchie's your man. The only real difference between this and Lock-Stock, is Snatch had a few more experimental camera shots and surreal settings than I remember Lock-Stock having. Funny, Brutal, and Interesting."
5,Snatched by brilliance,"""Snatch"" is a British crime-fiction film which contains a multi-layered story featuring several characters.As has become a trademark with Guy Ritchie works there is interaction amongst all the protagonists which shapes the narrative, and this at times is presented overtly and subtly.The casting of Jason Statham (as Turkish) and Brad Pitt (plays Mickey O'Neil) was masterful and both provide tremendous resonance to the story.It is a lively movie with plenty of surprises as the narrative unfolds and reaches a dramatic ending.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,Three Stars,"I'd actually give this 3.5 stars mostly due to the ending and the fantastic performance by Vinnie Jones. The ending (while to some) might be a surprise, over all there isn't a lot of true surprises. With that said, this movie has action, humor and a few twists and turns. If you don't like Guy Ritchie movies, you probably will not like this. Not a traditional action film, it has its moments. While not as strong as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it still has a place in the ""should see"" movie lists. Brad Pitt is surprising good in his roll. He proves that he isn't just a ""movie star"" but has acting ability as well. Jason Statham is his usual self (which depending on your view of him can be a very good thing) and Vinnie Jones quietly steals the show as he always seems to!"
5,a perfect movie,"If you're familiar with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels then you have probably already seen this film. If neither is true, then buy both, immediately. The action is fast-paced, funny, violent and meticulously scripted. The plots are wonderful and well thought out. The British actors are exceptional, particularly Jason Statham and the actor who portrays BrickTop. Dennis Farina has a hilarious role in this as well. All in all, this couldn't be any better."
5,Well worth the time and the money,"All I can say about this movie is that the more I view it, the more I enjoy it! Big hint: turn on captions. Otherwise you will likely not understand a lot of the dialog (unless your a pikey!) This is one of those movies were I can't figure out which character is my favorite (although it might be Brick Top). Rent it, buy it - just enjoy it!"
4,"a little midleading, but great","I don't know why they advertised this movie to say Brad Pitt is the big star, because he definitley isn't featured the most --and he's not the best actor there. Everyone does an amazing job with a fun script. This is an awesome movie, but it misleads people to think Brad Pitt is the big star."
2,Not bad,"Nothing special really,a strange depicition of londoners (i dont know anyone and have never met anyone like the people in guy ritchies films).I know its just a movie but lock stock and two smoking barrels was cheesey aswell every cliche in the book is used.Rent or buy sexy beast"
2,A LUMP OF COAL,"okay,lets count the cliches: a heist movie that rips off scenes from other movies far superior than it, stylized,hip gangsters, moral ambiguity where everyone's a victim but no one's innocent, cool camera angles we've been seeing since Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and finally, a smattering of hip hop flava. At some point I am confident this fad will run it's course. But until then, i am sure we'll see a lot more of these lumps of coal."
5,Snatch- One of the best in a while,"Where to begin? As a non-Brit, I had to watch this movie thrice just to get all the dialogue down. That's okay, because if you like comedies of errors, you'll want to watch Snatch thrice.One of my only gripes is I was disappointed with Benicio Del Toro's small amount of screen time. The commercials and reviews give the impression that he's one of the leading characters. Brad Pitt was funnier than I was expecting; his portrayal of Mickey seemed very accurate. Turkish's wry narration kept me chuckling throughout, and the introduction of Bullet Tooth Tony towards the end made up for Del Toro's small screen time.All in all, very entertaining quality film. What pleased me the most was the lack of romantic sub-plot, which is now becoming almost a strict formula in films. I thought the plot moved nicely, with an appropriate ending."
2,Simply One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made,"I had (notice the past tense) a girlfriend who loved this movie and brought it over one night for us to watch. The way she described it made me really want to see it. Unfortunately, her sales skills far surpassed anything the movie had to offer. I was under the impression that this was a comedy - and I really enjoy comedies - but the comedic moments were few and very far between.Part of the fault for the sad overall outcome of this movie must lie with the editor. The movie could have flowed far better, been easier to follow, and been funnier with proper editing."
1,LAME DISNEY STYLE FLICK!!!,"this movie just makes me angry i dont know how the talentless director Guy Ritchie would make an action film with out any blood or gore. this has less sexual tension then monsters inc. and toy story combined. this movie was a serious disapointing to an evil,sick and sadistical gore hound like myself. if you wont to see a better film watch irreversible,i spit on your grave or salo and the 120 days of sodom."
5,I love this movie enough to pay $25 for the Bluray version.,"That should tell you something right there. This movie is a 5/5, and one of the only movies I can stand to watch more then once or twice. It's pure entertainment from start to finish. Never a dull scene. If you don't own this movie, buy it now."
4,cheeky,"lets be honest. taken seriously this movie is juvenile and typical. but i dont think ritchie had that in mind, i think that this is a very good tongue in cheek 'bang-bang' movie making fun of the entire genre it relies so much on. its fast, funny, and sick. if your looking for profundity watch some bergman. if your want silly british making fun of themselves give this a go. just please dont take it seriously, i dont think that is the point. and if it was than it the most pompous postering i ever seen come out of a punk english-man's rear. but even so, just laugh at it and remember the authors intentions are not always the most reliable source for truth."
3,"Lock, Stock and Brad Pitt with his Shirt Off","The casting was great, and there's an edginess to Mr. Madonna's movies that can be very enjoyable. But aside from Brad Pitt's delightful performance, this movie is a virtual remake of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."" Individual stories merge at the end for a big denouement, with the bad guys getting their comeuppance, and the good guys not only making out OK, but learning a lesson of some kind. Rent it, don't buy it."
5,Bernie Gehret's expert film review,"Having written a screenplay in the action/comedy genre, I fully enjoyed the masterful way Guy Ritchie created this film. Every character had a distinct, unique profile, the story kept you on edge and entertained, and the dialogue was refreshing and unique (as well as unintelligible at times!). Great movie, made my top 5 list."
3,"""OK"" blu ray conversion","This review is just about the Bluray quality.The bluray quality on Snatch was fairly sharp and it was nice to watch the movie again, but the HD didnt really ""pop."" I wasnt saying ""Wow! It's so HD!"" I was saying ""Uhhh? I can hardly tell."" Granted, the movie was shot on film and not digitally.So its ""OK"" hd quality. I really don't think you are missing anything if you go and buy a cheaper dvd version. If you are a huge Snatch fan like me, then its worth it, but i felt a little jipped."
3,Snatch - Review,"Director Guy Ritchie returns to London's mean streets, rife again with characters such as Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). Several interlocking plots revolve around a scramble for a stolen 86-karat diamond, an attempt to fix a boxing match and ... pigs. Brad Pitt is a standout as a bare-knuckles fighter who speaks a gypsy dialect nobody understands."
4,Classic Guy Ritchie,I put people onto this movie all the time. I wish Guy Ritchie would make more stuff like this and Lock Stock
3,Yes and No,"This is a hilarious story, but it is very rough. It doesn't seem possible to use the f-word so often and in so many different ways, even embedding it into other words. There are parts that make me laugh out loud, and I love the characters, but a lot the laughter relates to things that I'm not sure are really laughing matters????? And then there are the REALLY rough parts that are hard to get through. I love the gypsy dog that swallows the squeaky toy (and then squeaks when he barks) along with everything else in sight, the Russian mafia guy they just can't kill, the huge getaway driver who can't fit through the car door nor back into a large parallel parking spot... but I could do without the violent robbery, mass murder, attack dogs, and foul language. Periwinkle blue, anyone?"
1,"Scratched, won't play","Scratched, won't play, bought new, so very upsetting, was also a gift for a special person...very disappointed. Will be returning, and now going out to the store to purchase a trusted item."
1,amazon unbox rips you off because there's no subtitles or chapter selection,"amazon video on demand and unbox has no subtitles and no chapter selection what so ever. i should have bought the real dvd, which i now have to do so anyways because i need to analyze this film for film class.i had the utmost respect for amazon and thought they were on par with everything before this incident."
2,I planned on enjoying this movie...just didn't happen.,"Okay, I'll admit that Brad Pitt was amusing and I liked the fact that the Dvd had subtitles just for him. The story was all over the place and the accents made the dialogue very hard to follow. I liked some of the editing and humor, but as a whole I wasn't that impressed. I'm sure glad I saw this one for free."
1,Wrong item!!!,"I placed an order to receive Snatch Dvd and instead the Dvd inside was of Fight Club, which I already own!! These people do not know what they are doing!!!"
3,May Be A Good Movie If Only We Could Understand Language,"This may be a good movie. We couldn't tell and gave up about 45 minutes into it. We've had to do this on some other films from the UK too as we simply cannot understand most of what is being said. This is because the film is using British working class accents (I don't know what else to call them) which we can't decipher. I am writing this ""review"" simply to warn other viewers that if they have the same problem that we do, this film may be a bad choice for them. I cannot review the other aspects of the movie since I have no idea of what was going on in a movie where I can't hear what they are saying."
1,Really awful,This is a violent unpleasant movie. It's very difficult to understand the characters when they speak. However this may be the most merciful aspect of the film.
4,Blu Ray - A Strong Improvement,"Snatch is one of my all time favorite films. He took the brilliant creativity and character development of Lock Stock and used a huge budget to make a dazzling film. Too bad his magic was lost on subsequent films. That notwithstanding, the Blu Ray is great. Its a strong, but not huge, improvement over the original. The video quality is very good, but much of Snatch was filmed in such a manner that aspects of the Blu Ray quality are unattainable (gritty scenes, overcast scenes (it is Britain), etc.). However, I am impressed. I would recommend, though, that you be a fairly devoted Snatch fan to justify upgrading your copy to Blu Ray."
5,Witty with a Whole Lot of Violence,"Guy Ritchie knows his way around a movie camera. His last film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, handed us a bunch of guys down on their luck and out a couple of grand. In this movie we get a group of all-star competitors all on the hunt for a diamond the size of a fist. Brad Pitt, a bare-knuckled boxer gypsie? Dennis Farina, a crime boss? Benicio Del Torro, a crook with a gambling problem? You better believe it. And you have to see it to do so. The editing of the film is exquisite. Every scene you either laugh histerically or you cringe at the gruesome violence. You have to own this one. If you loved Lock, Stock, then you this movie is a MUST own."
4,"Heard Bad Things but,","It was suprisingly good. There are so many twists and turns it really holds your interest. The only thing that was difficult was trying to understand what in the world Brad Pitt was saying three-quarters of the times, bravo to him for pulling off the ""parkies"" accent! It was a marvelous perfromace by Pitt and his co-stars, it is a hetic, super involved kick butt movie. I would highly recommend it for all you sitting home on a friday night :)"
3,Would Like Better With Sub Titles!,"I enjoyed most of this film even though I had to guess what was going on. I actually rented this on Netflix and tried to watch it at least 3 times before finally giving in and just putting up with the speech in it. I understood only about 40% of what was being said. The accents are horrible and I could understand nothing Brad Pitt said. The plot was confusing enough but when you add in the fact that you can't understand the dialog, it makes you want to give up on the movie. However, there are some funny parts in it and I think I caught the general idea of it. I may at one time rent the actual DVD so I can run the subtitles and appreciate the film more."
5,A Top Notch Movie,"Snatch is a brilliant movie with a good plot all the different stories come together in the end. Brad Pitt is Brilliant in this film with an unforgettable accent. This film is an instant, buy don't even bother renting it you will end up buying it anyways"
3,Snatch,"Since ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was released in 1998, British cinema has been eager to cash in on its succes with imitators. That could be one of the reasons why ""Snatch"" is such a disappointment. Its due to the fact that writer/director Guy Ritchie hasn't built on the promise he showed. Yes, his undoubted visual perfection is still there - never so clearly than by the firey opening - but don't believe the film-maker's hype that ""Snatch"" is 'completely different' to ""Lock Stock"". It isn't. But Mr.Madonna's effort is ultimatley damaged, while it also serves to harsh facts: for one, it is becoming very apparent that Ritchie's writing skills are no match for his directorial ones.!"
2,Skip the 2 Disc Deluxe Edition,"I loved this movie, so much so that I wanted to get the ""behind the scenes"" 2 disc edition to learn more about how the story was written and how the movie was developed. In my opinion this is a good example of how NOT to do a 2 disc edition. Long on storyboarding and deleted scenes and short on ""behind the scenes"" stuff. What a disappointment! I'm keeping my single disc edition of course, but the 2 disc edition is going right back on the market."
5,Hilarious,"It's the same as Lock, Stock... I'll agree. Identical storyline. but I feel this film is superior, and alot funnier. I thought there were some hilarious scenes and a few little jokes that you might miss. I can't stop watching this movie. Some people must not get the British humour, or maybe Americans are stupid. I don't know what it is, but people just don't get the movie. It's like it is to hard to think about a movie, everyone's to use to Die Hard style plots. I enjoy this movie, and anyone who enjoys English humour or liked Lock, Stock, this is for you."
5,Well assembled film and DVD edition,"Guy Ritche has a certain style common to his films. Yet ""Snatch"" succeeds where ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" could not. It is fast paced and very will executed. Each character is bigger than life, full of silly quirks and all are very funny. The DVD does not disappoint. Loaded with extras, including a very amusing detailing of Guy Ritche's system of ""fining"" the cast and crew for various infractions during filming. Cell phone going off during a take costs you so many pounds. Late for crew call...that'll cost you, and so on. Quite amusing. In every way, fans of this movie will love this disc."
4,"Great Filming, Great cast. Decent plot","The thing about Snatch that thrilled me the most was the way Guy Ritchie chose to film his scenes. I thought it added a little bit of ""hip and exciting"" element to this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when they are all dressed as Rabbis and go in and rob the Jewl store, the filming is cool and different. The down to this movie is the fast moving plot. I had to see it twice to get it fully but then I had a ""oh ya I get it"" type of reaction.When I ask my friends If they have scene it they say ""oh that movie with Brad Pitt ya it was okay."" Brad Pitt (although he is in it) plays a CO starring role. Some of the larger roles are givven to Vinnie Jones and Jason Stathem. Despite the fastness of the plot Snatch is definatly worth a shot at seeing. See it agian if you dont get it. Rated R for lauguge and some violence"
4,"rock 'em, sock 'em fun","This movie is a fast-paced, fun movie. If you have watchedLock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels (Widescreen Edition)and liked it, you will enjoy this movie."
4,entertaining and oddball - loved the Brad Pitt character,"TAke full advantage of your DVD's ability to make subtitles because you'll need it with all of the accents - especially Brad Pitt's.To make it short, I'll mention what I liked:-I liked the use of commentary by Turkish and Tommy during the movie - they serve as the de facto narrators.-I liked the rapid-cut intro and the way the director used the security cameras to show us the progress of the diamond thieves during the opening credits.-I really liked the Brad Pitt character.-the dog was fun (and hungry).-I liked the way all of the characters were sleazy and yet markedly different from one another.-I like the fact that the DVD includes deleted scenes with commentary. I did not like the fact that the commentary usually did not tell me why the scene was deleted."
5,You cant miss with this classic !,THIS MOVIE WAS A CLASSIC AS SOON AS I HIT PLAY ON MY VCR IN 2001 WHEN I FIRST WATCHED THIS. TOTALLY ENTERTAINGING FROM BEGINNING TO END. BRAD PITT REALLY IMPRESSED ME THE MOST AND LOVED SEEING JASON STATHAM AGAIN. HE WAS SO AWESOME IN LOCK STOCK. WISH THAT GUY WOULD MAKE A 3RD (NOT COUNTING REVOLVER) FILM INCLUDING MANY OF THE SAME ACTORS LIKE BRICK TOP AND BULLET TOOTH. YES I WILLL STRONGLY RECOMMEND. I BOUGHT THE DVD A WEEK AFTER BUYING THE VHS. THEN YEARS LATER I BOUGHT THE SPECIAL DVD EDITION WHICH CAME WITH A BOOKLET AND POKER SET. AWESOME COLLECTION !
1,Special Ed. fatigue...,"My god, people... How many of these do we have to put up with?? I mean, I'm a huge fan of this friggin' movie but didn't I already buy a 2nd Special Edition of sorts with the ""Single Disc"" that included a bunch of goodies.I hate to use the words ""rip-off"" or ""money-grubbing"" when it comes to DVD editions of movies like this that I love because I'm usually the biggest sucker, but gimme a break here..."
3,ryan hickneys snatch review,i only saw moview once so i cant really say much about it except that it was funny and a good movie. bye
1,Worst Place To Buy Movies!!!!!!!,"I tried to buy the movie ""Snatch"" from them about a month and a half ago and they have still not shipped me my movie. This is the worst place to buy a movie from. I have only tried one time, but I will never try again. Pick another buyer to buy from because this one is untrustworthy at best!!!!"
1,Overrated,"I was upset that I wasted my money on this film. The film is extremely overrated. At best it should have only gotten 3 stars. I do not see what there is to like about this film. It was not funny, the plot was stupid, everybody's running around trying to find a diamond and the movie just ends so abruptly, not a comfortable ending at all. If you have never seen this film I highly suggest that you rent it before you buy it."
1,A personal view,"After seeing this film (or the 30 minutes of it I could bear) I felt an overwhelming need to try to let the director know that there is a sweating, balding, 465 lb man out there who has knelt on the floor with his wife's album covers fanned out in front of him. I should know. I am that man. I feel Guy Ritchie has done exactly this to me with this bilge."
1,Garbage,"This movie is trash. I feel guilty even spending any time thinking about it, so low on the hierarchy of artistic achievement does it sit. But it manages to be bad in several very interesting, novel ways. It's a new form of terrible. The movie is beautifully shot, for example. It has learned how to be flashy and shallow from a generation of music videos and special effects. Wow. Bravo. The plot, too, is reasonably interesting. There are certainly too many undifferentiated characters, but overall, the story could have been adapted into a good noir type movie. But instead, Guy again tries to appeal to the surface generation, and succeeds in making a movie about as deep as a kiddie's waiting pool, and with as much intellectual value as a Burger King placemat."
2,not what I thought,"Usually, when I purchase Ghost Story books (short stories) they are ""based"" on true stories. This is written tales by popular authors from over a large time span. Some literature is hard to follow. I'd rather stay with today's writings.I found the book to be rather boring and only one to be interesting."
4,A great read..,I loved this book..for those of you who enjoy 19th century novels this book is perfect.
5,Sooo much fun!,"I don't know if I was more excited or my daughter when we first got this kit. It is the PERECT gift to any girl on a birthday and it is now requested that my daughter give as a gift.You don't put the make-up on your face but on the face paper, so fun!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this kit as a gift for my niece, who loves art projects and coloring. However, I was a little disappointed when it arrived. There is no outer package around the product, so the inside of the kit had spilled out into the shipping box. The sketch paper pad was completely detached from its backing, and there is no way to re-attach it. The color wheel is not attached to the tri-fold either, although it looks like it should be because there is a little cardboard ""pocket"" around it that has glue lines on the back. I will still give it to my niece because I don't think she is old enough to recognize the way it should have been put together, but overall the quality of the product was sub-par. There are also no instructions, so I didn't realize the product was not meant for use on the skin (found that out after reading some of the other reviews). Bummer."
4,rockstarmom,My 7 year old received this for Christmas and loves the sketches and applying the makeup. The set contains great intructions and many different make up applications. Even the adults were playing with it. Great gifts for girls.
4,Fun Toy Overall,"My daughter who just turned 7 got this for Christmas and likes to play with it. I'm not gonna say she absolutely loves it but she does like it very much, she probably plays with it about once a day. The toys' composition is a bit flimsy since the paper tears out easily and the compartment that holds the make-up became unglued but other than that it's a pretty fun toy."
5,No more excuses!,"I had a baby 4 months ago and I was feeling too busy to get back into the gym routine. However, as the cover says, ""everyone has 10 minutes"". Now I am able to work on toning up my body during nap times. No more excuses!"
1,Clinical,"If you like high energy and music when you work out, this is not the routine for you! It is very basic and clinical for any one who likes to have fun while getting fit."
3,This is a review of the FIRST edition,"so it might be outdated. That being said, I do not care enough to find out if Mr. Gray's writing skills have improved since then, because, along with braces and eighties hair bands, it is not somehting I have any interest in enduring yet again. Lots of reseacch, plenty of insight (his analysis of ""Kahotek"" from Fables is extremely illuminating, but, man, what a miserable excuse for a writer...You'd be better off reading Talk About the Passion and the Rolling Stone compendium."
5,"Absolutely brill, indispensable background-info.",Contains all the stuff u ever wanted 2 know about this world's best band. + it's hilarious. Definitely recommendet reading 4 any fan!
1,broken,"Very frustrated. I recieved this item and new that it might not be in it's orriginal packaging, because there was a disclaimer to that fact,and that was ok. I did not expect the item to come broken! The flute case has been discontinued and my daughter has one that is the same. The bag is great, but the one I ordered came wth a broken closing clip. Kind of an important aspect to the item. It should not have been sold broken. Very disapointed!!!!"
5,It works!,"I am an African American woman with palm-rolled locs. I was looking for a good clarifying shampoo... I work out several days a week and because of the locs I try not to ""overwash"" my hair to avoid unraveling. I normally wash my hair once a week but noticed that my scalp started to become itchy and dry lately. I bought this yesterday (on sale at the grocery store for 99 cents!) and used it last night and it worked great! My hair was literally squeaky clean. I contemplated getting the Neutrogena clarifying shampoo, but wanted to try this first because the N product indicated that it could only be used once a week and I was afraid it would leave my hair dull and lifeless. Since this is a ""daily"" clarifying shampoo I'm sure I can use it every other wash or so to remove build up without issue. I strongly recommend this product and you can't beat the price!"
5,Cleans well,Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo cleans my oily hair well. I use it every day with only a tiny bit of conditioner on the ends. If you have oily hair try this shampoo - it can't be beat for the money.
2,Product doesn't match the picture.,Suave changed the formula for their clarifying shampoo. I ordered these based on picture of previous look but the new formula arrived. Leaves hair oily.
1,Lousy book,This book cannot even begin to prepare you with their very vague review of sciences. the practice tests are way too easy and have no reflectio whatsoever of the MCAT. Don't waste your time with it!
1,Do not waste your time....,This book was a joke; if you plan on doing poorly on the MCAT waste your time learning from this book. I especially loathed the practice tests. I would suggest Kaplan for the 2000 MCAT.
1,Bad all over,"Take the last three reviews on this website seriously. This review is utterly terrible. If there was ever a book that warranted a toss to the dumpster, it was this one. The reviews are negligible, the tests are terrible, and the advice is bad! For example, it advises you to use textbooks to study and the electrochemistry review is literally a third of a page long with no formulas. Please don't buy this book."
1,Waste of time,Save you time and money and don't buy this book. I check it out from our local public library. Still it's a waste of my time to borrow it. This book got mistakes all over the place and the model tests are way easier than the real test.
2,Poor design,Works alright but there are too many design flaws:Easy to cut your fingers on jagged edges.Door is a pain.Spring clips catch lint.Easy to tear screen on inside door spring brackets.No exterior mounting brackets.Screen is awkward to remove.
3,Melancolico,Este es un excelente disco para recordar uno de los mas notables mitos de la musica de protesta latinoamericana y chilena. Oir a victor jara es oir uno de los episodios mas tristes de la historia latinoamericana. Recomendable aunque algunas interpretaciones son regulares.
4,Too early to know,"Battery works great for now; hopefully it will last. I cannot tell whether it's expired, as it has no expiration date, so only time will tell."
5,Wow he loves his cycle !,"I bought this for my grandson's second birthday. He cant reach the pedals yet but that does'nt stop the great time that he has riding it all over the house. When he looks at it he says my cycle my cycle! The lights and sounds are the cutest part of this trike to me. This was well worth the money.Thanks so much.Grandma,Annie"
4,BIKE!!!,"My dad bought this for my 2 year old son's birthday, and while (like other kids his age) he cannot reach the pedals, he has a great time pushing himself along with his feet. The trike has tons of different sound effects and seems to be very sturdy. My kid has been running around all day yelling ""BIKE!!!"" and getting on and off of it. He loves it."
3,It's cute,"Cute toy...not quite as cool as I thought it would be. My 2 1/2 year old son likes it, but honestly spends more time on his regular old tricycle than on this."
4,Slow down nelly!!!,"i got this today for my little girls 4th birthday,despite the tons of stickers and her hard time peddling i have no complaints. i really like the fact that the seat is adjustable. the sounds r awesome especially because it tells u which direction u r turning and what the wheather is. we will have this for a while as it will grow with her."
3,An ok overview of some interesting artists,This is certainly not the definitive book on the music and musicians in Canada from the past century. I was frustrated by the lack of well known artists not represented in this volume and surprised by the inclusion of many lesser known artists. I do realize that not all artists can be covered in a single volume. In summary I believe it is well worth a quick view but for various reasons (one being its price) I would advise checking it out from the public library before spending $40 dollars purchasing this book. I don't think it is a volume I will be returning to time and again which usually is an important consideration when buying a reference book such as this
2,Made in USA?,"When I bought this product I had gone to the Made in USA site and this came up. When I received it, it said it was made in china."
5,Aznavour at his best!,"Charles Aznavour is the consummate actor/composer/singer of the 20th Century. This DVD demonstrates the depth of the man through his incredible performance. I love the close-ups of his face and the dynamic versatility of his emotions. Understood in English or French, this is a master.Not to be missed by Aznavour fans."
3,"Nice background music, but not a masterpiece","As a fan of singing in general and Patrica Kaas' earlier work, I was disappointed in this album. Although Ms. Kaas' voice is as seductive as ever, much of the material here lacks the originality or emotional energy required to make the listener want to play the CD again and again. The result is mere ""mood music"" for which any easy-listening track could be substituted. From a commercial perspective, few if any of the songs have a ""hook"" that would endear them to the short attention spans of today's radio audience. I would suggest that those interested in Ms. Kaas' music should refer to her earlier works."
3,"It was good, not exciting.","The first 6 songs are good, but last 6 are boring.L'heure du jazz - that is the best song on there.My opinion of PK is that her CD's get better as time goes on.If you are a serious PK fan, than this would be a good addition to your collection, but don't expect much. It is no where near as good as le mot de passe or sexe fort. I now know why this CD is often so cheap here at amazon."
5,Fantastic,"After the success of Mademoiselle Chante and the change of the record company, Patricia Kaas managed to make another brilliant record. The whole CD is very laid back, retro, American. You can hear the songs, like L'Heure Du Jazz, Ou Vont Les Coeurs Brises, Regarde Les Riches, Tropic Blues Bar, Une Derniere Semaine A New York, with American jazz music as the background music. When you are listening to the CD, you feel you are in the United States in the 60s, 70s. Other powerful ballet songs are Les Mannequins D'Osier, Les Hommes Qui Passent, Bessie. Patricia Kaas is undoubtedly a diva in France. Her powerful and deep voice helps to express her rich feelings. This CD n Je Te Dis Vous/Tour De Charme are her best CDs of all. If you love Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, Patricia Kaas should/will be your another favourite female artist. She has the most beautiful voice among all French female artists after Edith Piaf."
4,Bravo!,"A fun and fast read about a world of discovery, both from the perspective of the new-parents and all four children as everyone discovers and rediscovers their individual challenges in finding family roles.For me, there were laugh out loud moments. However, those paled in comparison to the managed chaos of the everyday that the author lovingly portrays with a whisper-in-your-ear honesty that is refreshing in its confident modesty as he approaches an EVEREST of fear and revelation.This book seems a good primer for anyone expecting higher order multiples (as I am!). I continue to be terrified but am at least better informed that some terror is rightly founded. But, it also gave me great pause to know that it has been done and a healthy dose of humor mixed with constant honesty will guide the way."
1,It drove me nuts!,"This book drove me up the wall. There is not one single likeable person in this tale, including the kids, who are well on their way to becoming complete brats by the conclusion--thanks to their father's lack of discipline and their mother's constant absence. I didn't find it amusing that he let his kids run all over the place in public, or that bedtime was never enforced. Maybe Stockler is vicariously living his ""wild child"" side through them, but such selfish people do not make the world a better place. And spending time with them via this book is maddening."
1,"All that's wrong with ""parents"" today","This is a truly sad statement on today's society. People who go into debt to have children that they don't want to raise (the wife specifically) then cry poor the whole time while shopping at specialty markets and renting vacation houses. Please. They will parade their children around to boost their egos but when the time comes to actually parent, no one is around. The wife is especially disgusting - she can stay up at night to watch TV but can't help her husband take care of the fussy children. It is far from funny - more like pathetic."
1,big yawn,"If a woman had triplets and ""decided"" to stay home to care for them (mainly because she'd lost her job anyway), she wouldn't have a ghost of a chance of publishing a book about it. But a man does it, and he's supposed to be a saint? Give me a break. This book is boring and painful."
4,Do Yourself a Favor,"Having just finished reading this book, I must admit that at times I felt like the authur was way too hard on husbands and blamed them for all the problems in marriage. Surely wifes desire some blame in difficult marriages! Yet, the more I read and opened up, the more I felt his assessment is fair given our God given responsibilities as the head of the home. But, be warned; the lessons in this book will only work if you are committed to living a Christian lifestye. Although there are many type-o's throughout the book and it is a bit rambling at times, as my pastor says, ""you need to eat the hay and leave the sticks"". If you are able to be objective and set a side your natural defensiveness as a man, you will find many useful lessons in this book. Also, another excellent book on the subject is Loving Your Wife as Christ Loves the Church by Larry McCall. It is a kinder, gentler approach to the same subject. God bless!"
5,Excellent! For MEN ONLY!,Excellent advice for MEN. Wives: Please do not read. Give Hubby a chance to learn at his own pace and you will receive a BLESSING. We give this as a wedding gift to all newliweds.
3,Comfortable but seems to need adjustment all the time,"When you first put it on, it feels right. After a few washes, the back just seems to ride up after a while, as if the shoulder straps are a little too snug, but the rear portion wasn't tight enough. However it seem to still provide good support up front. I'm constantly having the adjust it when working out, but I love the feeling of the fabric as it feel so nice. If worn with a runner's top that is form fitting and tight, it stays put and is fine. Seems to be more of a problem with T-Shirts for some reason."
5,Very Empowering Music,"I have been a Charley Thweat fan since the 1980's. This is just one of his great albums that can help transform our lives through the power of his music. ""Take Your Power Back"" is one of my favorite. When I have those moments in life when I'm down or feel powerless, I can renew my spirit my listening to this song. Thank you Charley for your gift of music that you share with the world."
4,This product had a refreshing scent. The gel ...,"This product had a refreshing scent. The gel produced a thick lather and spread evenly on my legs. I was able to get a clean shave -- I was amazed with the results. I didn't even have to use lotion on my legs after shaving, because the aloe left my legs smooth and moisturized. I would highly recommend this product for a clean, smooth shave."
1,Too Many Typos in Kindle Edition,"The book itself is 5 stars. but the migration to Kindle was sloppy. Every few pages there is a sentence that loses its meaning to garbled words. Sorry, but this one needs to be read in paperback."
4,"""I'm goin' where the sun keeps shining, through the pouring rain...""","Like many people if not most, I saw the movie first. Twenty years later I decided to read the book. Moving story. I think it's a known fact that books are usually much better than their films, and this in no different. I loved the film of course, this just goes much deeper. There's no doubt I thought of Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight many times as I read, but it didn't keep my imagination from working. I liked the writing here quite a bit. I felt the cold streets of New York and smelled the smoke when Joe lit a Camel. If possible read this before seeing the movie. The soundtrack is good too."
5,Absolutely Superb,"Herlihy has brought us a classic. The American Dream and the struggle to attain it. Certainly not the happiest of storylines but well worth reading. I've yet to see the film, but if it's half as good as the book then it has to be a winner too. 100% Recommended."
1,Couldn't even finish it.,"This movie was popular at a time when my mother thought it was too trashy for nice people, so I was excited at the prospect of reading the book - for free even.I hated it. Joe Buck is an arrogant loser and so stupid it makes you squirm. I just couldnt wade through this. I know the book has been called a great novel, but it wasn't even close for me."
1,Uncomfortable,There is a lot of inflexible plastic on the arms and shoulders of this jacket which makes it difficult to move around in. Both my kids (9 & 12) gave this jacket a thumbs down.
3,Down and Dirty Rock and Roll,"This DVD is full of headliner artists. There are particularly great performances by Fats Domino, BB King and Ray Charles, who all dressed for the occasion and performed for the enjoyment of the audience.Some of the artists were casual to the point of being indifferent to the audience, which detracted from the experience. This portion of the concert would have been better presented on a CD.A higher standard of production would have made this a really good DVD."
5,Works very well for chronic constipation,I have been afflicted with chronic constipation since my hemorrhoidectomy several years ago. This product works very well for relief.
1,UNSPEAKABLY ROTTEN!,How the greatest rock/metal band ever cold submit this truly awful video to their adoring fans is baffling. I've seen them the world over at least a dozen times over the last 25 years and am mesmerized by how truly terrible it is. Maybe everyone involved in this wooden production - including the band - got hit by a truck just before the show. Save yourself...and avoid this video all costs. You have been warned!
5,Rockin' DVD!!!,I just purchased this dvd even though I read some bad reviews from others. As far as I'm concerned this DVD shows just the way the concerts were back in the day with the laser shows. Anyone who is a long time BOC fan or even new BOC fans would really enjoy this dvd. It is really a historical recording as you can no longer see the laser shows and it captures blue oyster cult just as the agents of fortune album came out with don't fear the reaper. The video and audio quality are fine. I almost didn't order it because of other reviews but am very glad that I did!!! Buy it and you won't be sorry if you're a real BOC fan!!!
3,"Bad audio, poor visuals, but BOC classic to the core","Sure, this product isn't great. The sound pretty much sucks, and the video quality is awful. But where else are you gonna get the chance to see the infamous 5 guitar jam or Eric's wrist laser? I never had the chance to see the original line up, being basicaly too young (I wasn't even ten years old when this was recorded), but now I have and it just makes me wish even harder that I had had the chance to see the original BOC. The drum solo got tedious and the sound fades in and out, the visuals are overdone -- but to see the wrist laser finally, and to hear Joey's bass solo and that 5 guitar jam... it was worth it. Is this for a die-hard fan? Yes, it is. But doesn't just being a BOC fan after all these years and turmoil qualify one as being a die hard?"
2,Audio and Video as bad as it gets,"Although I am a Blue Oyster Cult fan, I have to tell you that this DVD is as bad as it gets. The sound and audio quality are terrible. You should only buy this if you are a really big fan and get a really good price."
1,Not a fair representation of bands' talent...,"Grainy picture, terrible sound, this DVD is only worth the buy if you were actually at the show. I was not unfortunately. BOC is a great band and the DVD does not represent this at all. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
1,Atrocious!,"Boycott this piece of crap. Never should have been released. If you don't have it, get Secret Treaties instead - endlessly rewarding. (but try to find vinyl, sound quality on the Columbia CD is dead.)"
1,TERRIFYING!,"How could a BOC fan countence the release of this garbage? This is the worst rock video ever made. Fooloish and irrepentable. The psychadelic make-overs are laughable at best. There are no production values. Although BOC presents some of thier finer early work, this video manages to destroy them all. HOW DARE YOU!"
4,From someone who was there....,"I was lucky enough to have been at this concert and I can explain a bit about the quality of the footage. In the 1970's, the Capitol Center (which is where this event takes place) used to set up three cameras (one on the middle of the arena floor and two at each side of the stage) so that the concert could also be seen on the overhead big screens for those poor fans sitting up in the rafters. Basically this is a DVD of the footage from those video cameras, which accounts for the poor quality. Still, it's a rare glimpse into a band that was just about to break it big."
3,"It's music history, you whiners!","Ok, man with the mixer was maybe too high. All he did was he plugged/unplugged bass cable. So what? This is part of music history, and ONLY for real fans. It was year 1976! So MTV kids..get a life! Sad but true, the quality is awful. But hey, the band on the stage...is....The...Amazing....BLUE.. ÖYSTER..CULT!"
3,It's not bad....but,"I would recommend the dvd Black and Blue, it shows the Oyster boys as they really are...a great american rock band!"
5,Awesome!!!,"By ""Awesome"" I mean to see the original line-up! In my opinion that's worth the price alone! For what it lacks in overall quality; it makes up in pure listening enjoyment!! Long live B.O.C.!!!"
4,It'll do til something better comes along.....,"You've read the reviews. Bad picture, bad sound, bad performance. Not entirely true. I found the performance to be very good/typical and the picture pretty watchable. I sure wish the sound was better though!I saw them during this tour, 3 shows in 2 weeks. That's why I love this dvd, because it allows me to relive a great 70's show. I do feel a little sorry for people who pay $60-$70 for this disc. I was lucky enough to get it for around $20. If you're a BOC fan and can get it fairly cheaply, go for it!!"
2,Soon to be a collector's item,"I believe this has been discontinued. Probably a must-have relic for hard-core BOC fans, pointless for anyone else. As has been stated elsewhere, it's simply a video of the band captured and displayed during the concert for the benefit of people in bad seats. Fixed cameras, minimal editing, accidental lighting -- not exactly a pleasure to watch. I've always admired ""Don't Fear the Reaper,"" but I found its performance as well as all the others on this DVD less than compelling. My attention wandered constantly away from the screen."
1,Disappointing,I thought the audio and video quality was very poor on this DVD. The audio is only in 2 channel. The video was grainy. I knew it was going to be disappointing when during the first scene I saw the flash of stage explosions but the sound was dubbed out. I am a fan of Blue Oyster Cult and this recording is an injustice to the band.
4,The Blue Oyster Cult Caught In The Act!,"They may be old(er), but any glimpse of the Cult of the Blue Oyster is worth it. For the price of an audio cd you get to see the artists where they are most at home; on stage. The audio quality is a bit off, but think of the audio from their first few albums. Project your mind a little. It's like a good book. Your mind fills in any gaps that technology in 1976 couldn't. I never got a chance to see the band in their original line-up so this DVD brings some of the magic home. I enjoy any chance I get to sit back and listen to BOC, but it's even better when you see them interact as a band."
2,Only good for a flashback!,"I am a huge BOC fan... And the Amazon.com editorial is obviously written by someone obviously rather ignorant of the band... But truth be told... This DVD is pretty horrible. The sound mix is dreadful as it appears to be from the soundboard without a decent remix, and the pic is so grainy and dark it's as if it was transfered right from a 2nd generation VHS tape. On the plus side... The set list is pretty good despite the before mentioned problems in quality (Included is the rarely played 5 Guitars), but the band performs without their usual tightness. Also of possible interest is the fact that this performance is a flashback to the Oyster Boys laser days showmanship before hitting the club scene... But personally, I found my money WAY better spent on BOC's ""A Long Days Night"" DVD! Now there is a quality BOC DVD!!!"
3,It's NOT that bad!,"There are some parts that are pretty bad; but overall, I found the tape quite enjoyable. Despite the poor production, the songs are clear and the music is great. Don't expect great quality, and you won't be disappointed. I would recommended it to fans of Blue Oyster Cult though and not a person who has not seen or hear them before."
4,"""1976"" is a good video!","I agree with the person from northern california; this is a good concert. The quality is not tops, but it is fun to watch! I'd recommend it to anyone; as long as the understand that it does have it's falts."
2,Some good does come from this poor quality source tape.,"Yes the video quality is less than you might expect and the sound? Well it seems to me that a few people and some equipment are responsible for botching a recording of an otherwise great concert. I attended this very concert and I can assure you it did not sound this way during the actual performance. The recording sounds like a unremixed straight sound board recording with levels from various channels going up and down at random. The bass suffers the worst and sort of sounds like cabling to the sound board was to blame. Overall if you can forgive some of the sins of the recording job, this is a nice piece of BOC history and hopefully another from this era will be released which will make up for this ones shortcomings."
1,Pointless on DVD,"I must preface this by saying that I have been an avid fan of B.O'Cult since 1979. I've seen them perform live three times. I love their music and the mystique. If I had purchased this on VHS I would have thought the numerous audio problems were a manufacturing flaw. There is no reason for this to be released on DVD. Or VHS. Seeing the original lineup is a thrill, but the limitations of the recording (both audio AND video) is pathetic. You should purchase this ONLY to have the complete collection. By the way, anybody out there know where I can get a copy of the ""Black and Blue"" tour film?"
4,"Great book, but could be better. See full review.","Great book with large format color photos of WWII aircraft cockpits. All the classic Allied types, plus many Axis cockpits. Of special note are rare interior views of Japanese types. The only criticism I have is only one photo of each cockpit is included. Each largely shows only the instrument panel. Most are taken from a side angle so you do get some other features, but a wider angle or multiple views would provide additional details and a better perspective. In that respect, the scale modeler may have to go hunting elsewhere for those side panel details. The title should almost be ""Instrument Panel"" instead of ""Cockpit"". Still, an enjoyable book and useful reference."
2,Little Hallmark Dots,"Other folks have weighed in on the content of the book, so I have no need to do that. My comment will center on the aspect of the photography that spoiled the book for me. The crew obviously had applied little colored circular stickers to the various instruments so they could be coded for the captions. That was all fine and well, but 75% of the photographs were taken with the stickers still in place. It was sloppy work. Carping, perhaps, but I expected better. The same comments apply to the volume dealing with Cold War aircraft."
5,Excellent birds eye view of the cockpit,This book provides readers with a pilots view of the aircraft. The pictures and descriptions are phenomenal! Well Done!
5,Incorrect sound clips/titles,"Simply a wonderful Christmas CD and quite interesting, especially Rufus and Martha. If you can get past the mish mash of incorrect sound clips/titles in this Amazon listing, buy the CD. You'll be happy you did."
2,Surprised and disappointed,"I was not pleased with the quality of this recording. The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster. The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy! The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible. I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from ""The Bells of Dublin"" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded). The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one."
2,Uneven,"I bought this based on sampling Rebel Jesus and Il Est Ne. Both are lovely, moving pieces. But they don't justify the price of the CD. Some cuts are so poorly recorded the words are unintelligible. Rufus shows off his adenoidal whine way too often. Emmylou Harris, whose voice I normally love, sings O Little Town of Bethlehem entirely through her nose. And why o why did they think we wanted to hear a spoken ramble about getting drunk and fighting on Christmas? I think they phoned this in."
4,Easton Synergy Extended Delivers,"I started using a teammates bat and found it agreeable . The ""extended"" sweet spot allows for decent ball velocity even if you do not hit the ball ""dead balls on"" unlike many of the other upper end bat models which seem to have great pop only if you get the ball right in the bats powerzone.The information claimed ""no break in period"" necessary and, although I was able to use it with some success right out of the box, it seems to take about 100 to 150 swings before it really comes alive and the ball jumps off it !"
2,Time line?,"I thought it would be intersting to read Grace's story, but you almost already know everything about her through the other books. I prefer all the books in the series to stay focused on one main character like Willow and not about her mother or her daughter. I read a lot but this book bored me! I just finished reading, EVEN ANGELS FALL by Sherry A. Mauro whose writing style is a lot like the old Virginia Andrews. I highly recommend this author to any VCA fans. You won't be disappointed!"
2,"Many, many issues","First off I didn't have to finish the book because you know what happens if you read the rest of the Willow series (which was ok until the book about her daughter). This book goes more into Grace's story and what exactly happened to her. There were some interesting parts but then it got silly and you knew that her mother would change after the father's death and she would be misunderstood in Palm Beach.Unless you read all of her novels, this might not be the book for you. I agree with the other readers that either the ghost writer should stop using her name or go back the the stories taht are like Flowers in the attic and the Cutler series."
2,Into the Woods,"Having read the first three books of the DeBeers family, I found the fourth book to be perplexing. Why did they take us back in time to the life of Grace and her mother. Why not have made this the first book in the series?If one has read the other three books we are more than saturated with the story of Grace, her mother and Linden.What was this book's purpose. Seems it was made for the sake of another book in the series."
2,Into the Woods,"I have read every V.C. Andrews book and was so bothered by the incorrect timeline that I have not been able to finish the book. The time that Grace was a teenager would had to have been around 1965 at best. There weren't any DVD's CD's, legal abortions or date rape, as a matter of fact lasers were just becoming a reality. So when I began reading Into the Woods I was terribly disapointed. I really was looking forward to reading about Grace, but there were so many inconsistancies that the book now just sits in my bookself. I would only recommend this book if you've not read the series."
3,It's Justice,"I have been a V.C. Andrews fan for six years. I have read everybook ever written. I admit this series has not been the best but that would never stop me from reading any of her books. I will deffinately read all that are to come, I just hope they aren't as dissapointing as the DeBeers series has been. Out of the four books, this one is the best one. It's story plot is a classic V.C. Andrews story minus the romance, and the main character goes crazy which was a little different. Like I said this won't stop me from reading more books. I do hope they keep coming because as long as they are published I will purchase and read. I incredibly hope that they are better in the future."
2,Decent enough. But when does this take place,"I finished reading twisted roots and that was entertaining enough for a Vc Andrews novel but then they throw this book in and I'm reading it and isn't Grace supposed to be Hannah's grandmother? Why do they have the internet in her story, and rufies and a Shania Twain song playing on the radio? ... OR, Hannah lives years and years in the future where everything is just the same as now... Former VC Andrews books with the exception of Olivia, which carried writing and attention to detail which was just as bad, attempted to portray the history of a place through various generations of it's inhabitants. The place was a large part of the aptmosphere, whether it is an old plantation ""The Meadows"" or the wartime bayou add a large part to the story for me, and both the Landry series and the Cutler series was careful to portray a specific time frame. The real VC Andrews of course, was never as careless. Her works were meticulous and original and utterly amazing."
1,I saved money...,"by not buying this. I read it in the bookstore. Well, I didn't read it, exactly, I skimmed through it; that's all that needed to be done to get the tripe story figured out. While better than the dreadful Hudson series, I would rather have had something as good as FITA or Heaven in my hands. And this wasn't up to par. Sorry, GW, but you should seriously turn your job over to someone who knows how to write."
2,I love VC but I think this Ghostwriter is NUTS,I love all of VC's books I own everyone and even have bought the new one coming out the 29th pre-orderd of course but anyway I like her books and if you have noticed that since her passing her books have become more disorganized and kinda I dunno silly...but looking back on the subject of why this book was not written first..if you have read the flowers in the attic series you would see that Grandmother Cutlers story came at the end of the series why not at the beginning? Again writers are funny about things like that I just wish he (the ghostwriter) would go back to her original way of writing the suduction the insest the bayou everything like that....am I wrong?
1,Fear the Forest,This movie was too gross and violent. The script was weak and the acting poor. It's definitely not my type of movie.
4,A book to be read again and again,"I'd recommend this book to people from every age. it is a wonderful book which approaches the facts ironically. it makes you think while you're laughing. I had also read the original version, therefore I can say that this is excellent translation."
5,Loved it!!!,It was very refreshing. The best jazz I've heard from a new artist in a very long time. I think we'll be seeing a lot of him in the future.
5,Yummy,I love this stuff. My dad brought some home from his home town in New York. Love it. Great marinade. We skewer beef or moose cubes after letting them sit in marinade. Love it!
3,"Middle Of The Road Recording, Poor Mastering",This CD is badly mastered. There are annoying flaws at the end of two tracks. The CD has no scratches (I tested on several different players to be sure). It's a shame because I love Dr. Lonnie Smith. Not much quaility control at Zoho Music.[DW]
3,A come back!,"It's nice to have Deniece Williams back on the R&B scene again. I think she should have done new material. She still has that golden voice of hers for sure! This album could have been a little longer, but maybe this is a warm up for her. It's been over 30 years since the release of her ""This Is Niecy"" album (1976), and she's trying to get back in sync. You go girl!!!!!"
4,SHANACHIE LABEL PROBLEM,"GREAT CD MUSICALLY ,VERY SHORT ONLY 10 SONGS, THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE WITH THIS RECORD LABEL,AND ALL THEIR CD RELEASES , ARE THE MANAGERS READING OUR COMMENTS ? ARE THEY LISETENING? WAKEUP SHANACHIE LABEL MANAGERS"
2,Buyer Beware,This is the exact same movie as the 2008 version with the snowmobiler on the front. Just with a new cover. Confusing and misleading if you already have the older one.
2,Winter Blast & Mighty Machines,The two movies are the same even though the covers are different. We were disappointed as were our sons when we gave them each a movie. One had a snowplow on the front and the other has a snowmobile. It was disheartening.
2,Extremely Poor qualithy DVD,While the expisodes of the series are good. The manufacturing quality of the DVDs is horrible. Wait for the series to come out as a streaming NETFLIX product
5,i love it,love love love jessica alba and this show was awesome back then and still awesome now!! love the character joshua and ofcourse jensen ackles!
2,Second season turned out to be a major disappointment,"My husband and I enjoyed Dark Angel Season One so much that it seemed unbelievable that the second season could be so bad. The sexual tension between Max and Logan dissipated in the second season, since Logan leaves his wheelchair and has to deal with a genetically engineered virus. Agent White as a villian to replace Lydecker (who never was proved dead, mind you) didn't have the same menacing presence. The Jam Pony side plots disappeared, and were replaced with ridiculous mutants instead of your more believable mutants. Even the gag real from season 2 wasn't as entertaining as season one."
2,"First Season was a 5-Star, Second Season Bites","I am highly diappointed that Fox decided to cancel ""Dark Angel"". The first season was fresh, exciting, and fun. The second season, however was weak and somewhat cheesy. It went slowly downhill from there. The writers of the show could have done better and possibly saved the show from cancellation."
3,"Execellent Series, Poor DVD Release - No WS","I was so excited to hear Dark Angel was coming to DVD, that I preordered the first season as soon as I heard. When the second season came up for preorder, I hesitated because it didn't mention what aspect ratio it was in. I figured the region 1 release would follow the other regions and be widescreen (16:9), so I preordered it. Just got it today and was very dissappointed to find it is in full frame format. I am contiplating returning it because of this. I already have WS rips from other regions and just can see keeping this box set with its inferior transfer. By the way, both season 1 and season 2 were filmed and aired in widescreen (assuming you could receive HDTV). I wasn't too upset over S1 being in FS because all regions had FS. I think I might order S2 from Japan or the UK to get the widescreen version.--- If you want WS, don't buy the R1 version ---"
4,Why not a third season!?,"Very good show, too bad it ends like this... there is material for a third season!"
4,Great Sci-Fi series,"For any sci-fi fans, this show is great. It's entertaining, well-written, and fun to watch. Too bad there are only 2 seasons, I thought they set it up for what would have been a great 3rd season. Plus, the addition of Jensen Ackles to the show was great!"
3,Dark Angel second season- &#65533;spotty&#65533;,"This second season of Dark Angel, while it had a fair amount of good episodes, wasn't as strong as the first, which was refreshing and original both in terms of stories and cast. The second season opens with the destruction of Manticore, but a re-tooling probably did it in. Characters such as Joshua (can you say, Beauty and the Beast) Aisha (featuring an as yet unknown Ashley Scott, whose Huntress character in Birds of Prey was far superior), and Alec (a strong point) seemed to be just plunked down for plot devices, and the lack of Jam Pony storylines made for a general lackluster season. The Halloween episode was throwaway filler, and Lydecker being reduced to a neutral presence was also a negative. Pick it up if you are a devoted fan of Jessica Alba and the show, but get your feet wet with the first season if you plan on making an investment ,and decide from then if you need them all."
3,"Great Show, Bad Luck on Friday Nights","When Dark Angel moved to Friday nights at 8pm on Fox, we knew the show was doomed. DA fans secretly wished Firefly (its replacement) would die a horrible death. The fact is...the second season got away from the core of the first - it was too surreal, though beautifully directed and acted.I'm a huge fan...a bit disappointed with how the series ended. I agree, Fox shouldn't have cancelled the show - but then again the writers should have given us a better 2nd season."
5,This is NOT the widescreen version.,"I just want to give people a heads up. This version is NOT widescreen.If you have a widescreen TV, you should head over to Amazon.uk and orderthe PAL (European) version. It's encoded in anamorphic 16:9 widescreenformat. The only downside is, you will need to play it back on a PAL-compatible DVD player orhook your computer up to your TV, as all computers can play back PAL or NTSC.It's a shame FOX gave us NTSC (American) viewers this cropped 4:3 version.The version from Amazon.uk cost the same as this even with shipping, and took twoweeks to get here.Hope this helps someone.I'm still giving this 5 stars, because it's a wonderful show in any format.Alba's best work by far, and she's in every frame, so it's a must buy for her fans.Season One is good dark sci-fi action. Season two is more uneven, but still has alot of great moments."
3,Not as good as season 1,"I loved season 1, and expected great things of season 2. I was disappointed. There was a major storyline that wasn't resolved, even though this was the final season. It ended in a way that sort of completed the story, but not really. All in all, it left me wanting more with no hope of getting it."
4,Kniohia Wilson Review,I liked quality of my dark angel second 2. I also liked that it was no straches on the discs.
1,A waste of time,"OK, this show was one of the worst I have ever seen and I saw the entire season. The acting was... well there was none. The writing... I think they hired bums off the street. The characters... cookie cutter characters- seen them a million times in other shows. I love sci fi but this show just took a good story line (because the idea was really cool) and a hot actress, and made a massive car wreck."
4,"Second is good, First is better","Being a major fan of the first season, the second season was a bit of a let down. If you read some of the other reviews, they are spot on. Too much camp and freaky creatures. I missed seeing the individual soldiers and their stories (like Tinga and Brin), evading Lydecker by the use of their cool ""powers"", with Max and her big bro to the rescue.It was still good, tho and if you're a fan, I'd definitely recommend it. Because any bit of Max & Logan is still good. If it's the first time, try season one first. Season One is da bomb.There are 3 commentary tracks, which are helpful if you want to know plans for season 3 and beyond (this was one of main reasons I wanted this set). But it's more writers/producers and not any of the actors except for sketchy commentating. Blooper reel was just ok.So, 4 out of 5. Not as great as the first but still pretty good."
1,NOT Happy,"The first time I ordered this product I was happy at how fast it got here and was in great condition. However, when I got to the final disc of the season, the big episode...it wasn't there. There was a disc claiming to be what I was hoping to see but was actually the last disc of the previous season. No problem, I'll return it and get a replacement. Guess what? Same problem. Yes, I was able to return it and get my money back but doesn't get me what I want. And no one has contacted me on how to solve this."
2,Awsome,"Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 totally rock. I know some people say that season one is better but season two is just as good. I only wish that FOX would bring it back for a few more seasons. Although the series was cancelled I still highly recommend it to everybody. It will leave you wanting more. :) (by the way, I rated it 5 stars... I don't know why it came up with only 2 >:/ )"
3,mantacore mediocre,"After reading all online reviews, my girlfriends and I agree with them all. That,from the first season, the story does'nt have any consistency. And the whole ""don't touch me"" theme between Max and Logan really annoys us. Until Alec came along. Now we are all hoping that Max and Alec 'get it on' as they seem to have more in common than Logan and Max; who seem doomed to never get together (reminiscent of Buffy themes) so we reckon; HES HOT (Alec) and SHES HOT (Max) so whats the problem?"
4,An entertained Series.,An entertained Series.Elegant presentation.Good sound.Doblage in Castilian acquittal quality to the set.Doblage in Spanish is not very good.
4,Pretty Good,"I have to agree that I liked the first season better than the second. Most of this season is ""monster of the week"" as someone else said. I wish they would have used more story lines from the first season to tie it in. It was almost like a whole different show where the story lines kind of came out of no where. The Max-Logan-Virus issue got really old and wish it would have been resolved. But I really liked the last few episodes. The whole revolution they were creating I felt was very moving and Normal's tv interview at the end, I'll admit, made me cry. Overall I love this show and really wish they would have continued it on to a third season."
5,Excellent Series,"I love this season of Dark Angel way better than the first season. I was a little sad to see that they had cancelled this show altogether but it was great while it lasted. I watch these over and over because they are so good. If you like action packed series that have you on the edge of your seat all the time, then this is for you."
5,To Publish At First----!!!!!,"What better choice than this text? They're few and far between. A good source is always good to have, but a GREAT source like this is even better--!!!! I highly recommend this book~~!!!!!!"
5,The Real Deal !,"Superb music,wonderful musicians ! It doesn't get any better than this as we continue to realise how musically rich the 1920s and 1930s were.Hats off to Don Neely and the lovely Carla Normand."
5,A book to help console the desperate parent!,"Definitely recommend for anyone with a fussy baby like my angel. There wasn't any real new or different information from The Attachment Parenting Book, but just those same concepts applied even greater for the fussy baby as well as a lot of consolable information on getting through the first year or so, mother burnout, and the payoff of having a ""velcro baby""."
1,Don't waste your money!,"What a disappointment! There is no index, and the table of contents lists Salads/Desserts, etc., followed by the names of the celebrities (not even alphabetical!) ... so, to find a given recipe, you must begin at page 1 and start thumbing. Good celebrity cookbooks have tables of contents that list the recipes, and indexes listing both recipes and celebrities. Moreover, I could only find two recipes in which the contributor said why they were considered special. And, in most cases, you can find the identical recipes in other celebrity cookbooks - and THEY include the stars's words about why they treasure that particular recipe. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I'm returning my copy ... Yuck."
2,Boring read,Maybe it was the professor and not the book. It could have been more concise and energenic.
4,Book delivery - Organization Behavior,"Excellent turnaround! Shipped very quickly, would do business again with this seller!"
1,Total waste of time...,"Having taken the CBEST two days ago, I can assure you this book is a terrible waste of time and money. It covers WAY too much material, only a small portion of which is actually relevant to the test. The inside title page of the book says it all -- portions of the book are taken from Barron's other test prep books for the SAT, LSAT, GRE, California State Universtity Writing Proficiency Exam, and California High School Proficiency Exam! You will be infinitely better off using CliffsTestPrep CBEST by Jerry Bobrow published by IDG -- concise, focused, and accurate."
1,Too Much Info.,I took the Cbest in June 2000. This study guide has too much information. The test is basic. The practice tests were more complicated than the actual test. The Math portion doesn't represent what is on the actual test at all.
2,Too many math mistakes!!!!,I've been going over the arithmetic section of this book and I have found too many mistakes in the answers and the explantions!!! Wow - one could really get confused and frustrated. How is the rest of the book going to be? Am I going to find a lot of mistakes in the reading section also? I hope not!
2,Mistakes in mathematics section!,"It can be rather confusing when you are trying to review your math skills, and the book contains blatant errors in the solutions. The editor obviously overlooked a few things...on the bright side, if you can get past the frustration, it certainly keeps you on your toes when you are both learning and correcting their work at the same time."
1,How to Start & Manage a Bookstore Business,"I found this book not very helpful in my endeavors to conduct research to open a bookstore. The information provided was more inclined to give information on how to start any business, with only a small portion dedicated to the bookstore business specifically. The same information could be received from the SBA's website and other sources. It appears that the authors just took the basic ""How to Start and Manage"" series that they write and added a chapter on bookstores. I would not recomend it."
1,Generic information,"Lewis and Renne have produced a series of how to books. I have seen about 15 different titles in the series. They are almost all carbon copies of each other with the type of business, eg. book store, plugged in to the appropriate places in the text. The information is basic, simplistic and useful, but it is not tailored to the particular business except in a few of the manuals where a small amount of particular info is allowed to intrude on the boilerplate text. If you really want to know how to start and operate a bookstore, don't go to this manual that is not its purpose. If you want general information on starting a business, there are meatier offerings for the same price or slightly more. If you value books for the help or wisdom they offer, look elsewhere."
3,informative guidelines,"although simplistic, this book is good at singling out the basics of starting your own book selling business."
2,problem not resolved for weeks. Customer support needs improvement!!,"The games are good. My daugter who is 6 loves them. But after she finishes Unit 1, she keeps getting ""here at jump start camp, we have a few more things to do before we start the next adventure, why don't you quit the game and start over?"". We could not get rid of this no matter what we tried. Unit 2 never enables for us. Called their customer support, emailed them.......so far we were asked to send some files off our hard disk to them and no response after that........We have been trying to get them to resolve this issue for weeks now."
4,Great educational software for kids.,"JumpStart World 1st GradeJumpStart World 2nd GradeMy kids really enjoy playing them and they are learning age-appropriate problem-solving skills in a kid-friendly video game like environment. Along with the math, spelling and reading sections, I particularly like the fact that the games promote good listening (i.e. following directions) skills. The kids have ""tasks"" to complete in order to open different sections of the world, rather than just wandering around aimlessly playing games. There are also parent reports that enable you to see how they are progressing (i.e. where their strengths & weaknesses are). You get 2 adventure packs with this software and then you can go to the website to order a new pack to be automatically downloaded every month (costs about $7.99 per month). I would definitely recommend these products. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was long to install (first instance only)."
1,Not happy,"I wish the product description was more upfront. My daughter has been trying to get to the next unit but I'm now afraid you have to pay for the membership. I am not willing to do so when there are plenty of free educational games on the internet. The educational value was too easy for my five year old and there were too many ""fluff"" activities."
2,Great program but awful support,"When the software works, I think it is great. It combines the fun of playing a game with educational activities in reading and math. However, buying the CD is just the beginning, you have to really sign up for the monthly subscription for it to go to other levels. The program is poorly written and if you don't exit it properly you are completely messed up and have to uninstall and re-install the software and you child has to go over everything again. This has happened to my son 3 times and it is very frustrating. I think they just don't want to fix this as it keeps the usage/subscription going for a longer time. I wish there was a better competing product on the market as I really don't like what they are doing."
3,Portability,"I bought this product for my six year old daughter and she loves it. I enjoy watching her work through the first unit. The software has excellent ways of challenging a child's intellectual abilities. The only issue I have it that the internet access is required to run the software. I wanted an application program that she could use on road trips. The interactive component is amazing; however, I would prefer if the application had the ability to run in stand-alone mode."
3,tedious,"While the text provides a lot of detailed information about research studies and theories, it is a bit tedious in rehashing the same information chapter after chapter. Basically, it tends to make the same points repeatedly throughout, and I found it somewhat boring to read. Also, the pages lack any hint of color, which only adds to the monotonous feeling."
1,No better than OEM,Trying to match the the halogen turning lights on my BMW to the HID headlights. They look no better than the stock halogens. Quite yellow. No improvement whatsoever. A complete waste of money.
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT INCLUDES ME.,"I SAW THIS THREE TIMES IN ITS CITY OPERA INCARNATION, WITH THE INCOMPARABLE CAROL NEBLETT, AND OWN THE RECORDING WITH RENE KOLLO AND HER. I AM A PASSIONATE FAN OF ENTARTETE MUSIK. THIS PRODUCTION IS SUCH A SAD BETRAYAL OF THE ORIGINAL, IT'S PATHETIC. THE VOICES ARE FINE, THOUGH THE SINGERS ARE RENDERED UNGAINLY AND THE PROTAGONIST IS CLEARLY PREGNANT. COSTUMING: 0; SETS, 0; MISE EN SCENE, 0. A TOTAL JUMBLE OF A PRODUCTION, BETTER LISTENED TO THAN SEEN. I STRESS THIS: NOT TO BE WATCHED, JUST HEARD. GOD, I HATE POST-MODERNIST REVISIONISM!"
4,Die Tote STadt DVD,"great opera : acting, singing, staging all goodatmosphere of the novel well renderedthat's all i have to say"
5,Makes You Feel Good All Over!,"This is one of the best compilation CD's that I have ever heard. It features all of Stephanie Mill's #1 songs plus her other classic hits. There are many different compilation CD's of Stephanie that are offered on Amazon.com, but this is by far the best. I can't stop listening to her beautiful voice, especially such songs as I Have Learned to Respect the Power of Love, Puttin' a Rush On Me, and Sweet Sensation. A must!!!"
2,How many times can one artist,"RERELEASE the same 8 or 10 songs!!???!??!! Ugh... it's painful to think of the meeting that took place at the record studios declaring it a good idea to regurgitate this material. Mills has no less than 5 ""greatest hits"" or ""ultimate collections"". Don't you need to produce some new material for that to be repeatable. An amazing talent, sadly with more ""greatest?"" hits than original hits.This is said out of love as I would like to hear more from Ms. Mills that I DON'T already own."
3,Worth the price to my wife.,"While I don't suggest this is a really great watch, it had sentimental value to us, my wife had owned one for a long time and the bracelet had fallen apart. It has not been made for a long time, vintage, and the new one has since also had the beaded bracelet start to fall apart in daily wear. I also have replaced the battery twice in a year, not a great thing.I think it is a pretty watch and she likes it but I would probably not buy it as a new gift for her. Sorry."
1,Sorry I bought this booklet,"This booklet is correct in standing against the silly doctrine known as the ""Baptist bride"" doctrine. However, the author of this little booklet is, by virtue of his own dispensationalist bologna, hardly in a position to judge another silly doctrine. This booklet is not scholarly-- and it is really not very informative."
5,What is truth?(Pilate),"Hello the last reveiwer is so wrong; dispensations are true not every one is saved the same way throughout the bible. In fact no one is saved to Heaven until the cross, they are saved from Hell but not to eternal life. Abraham believed God and it was credited to him for righteousness. What did he believe? In Jesus NO! He believed he would have a son in his old age (as an example). Adam and Eve are not like us, anybody with common sense can see they are innocent and only need to worry in that dispensation to not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thats it! Do we do this? NO! this is the dispensation of innocence. As for the book this book has more truth than any two Christian celebrities combined. -----------5 STARS"
3,This shampoo was thick and rich feeling and ...,"This shampoo was thick and rich feeling and produced a nice lather in the shower. The drawback that I instantly noticed, though, was a very strong """"mediciney"""" type odor that lingered on my hair even after I dried it. On the plus side, it gave me lots of volume and body and really cleaned my scalp thoroughly. While I generally don't like Head & Shoulders because of its strong smell, I think it does an excellent job of cleaning hair and controlling dandruff."
3,"After using the store brand for this product, ...","After using the store brand for this product, I have to say that this one is obviously better quality. You need much less of it to lather up your hair, which is more economical. I think the difference in quality more than makes up for the difference in price, so it's definitely worth it to buy the more expensive product in this case. As far as helping dandruff problems, I'd have to give it a thumbs down. I couldn't really see any difference there."
2,I didn't really like this shampoo. It left ...,I didn't really like this shampoo. It left a smell that announced that I'd used a dandruff shampoo. I've used others that worked better and didn't smell bad.
4,This shampoo was a big help for my ...,"This shampoo was a big help for my dandruff problem. Just a day or two of use, and the flakes are gone. Head and Shoulders is a brand I trust. I really liked this product, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their dandruff."
2,Just okay,"I bought this book to review and understand the state of White Studies. The book is an edited compilation of articles, most of which were ""complaining"" about the unfair treatment of White people. Ha! I saw a few articles that addressed the issue with maturity, as well. The book was not the hard-hitting, critical work that I had hoped. It was largely pissing and moaning, and making excuses for white supremacy."
3,Basic Drum Tips,"This is a nice dvd, introducing you to some easy tips and simple ideas to get better technique, the only problem I had is that one of the first things Michael shows you is that he uses a custom bass drum pedal, with no heel plate, and teaches heavily from that point. How are you supposed to follow him when you don't have the same type of pedal he does, thus, you can't get the same feel or adaptation from what he's teaching??? Having said this, applying what he shows is fairly straight forward, and for the price, all drum dvds are worth watching, you're sure to pick up a few tips along the way."
4,Work the pedals,"The CD is quite informative, even though it's difficult to describe the functions of the strokes there should be a little more emphasis on the mechanics of the different strokes. I also studied Steve Smiths CD on the bass drum technique and found a happy medium on the ankle stroke.All and all it brings you a STEP ahead;)"
1,For Beginners Only,"I'm only giving this book 1 star because the reviews are very skewed. If you know how to play it's of absolutely no help. Basically it talks about comps and playing longer by holding high cards along with some very basic strategy. There is nothing systematic at all. There is nothing about ""how"" to wager, just don't bet more than your bankroll can stand. You can buy the strategy cards at the casino or find them free online and your money would be better spent. Not much here to brag about. Just another book rehashing the same old ideas only with a different title and author."
5,Good daily supplement,"Good product/supplement - I do find value in the long term commitment to taking this supplement - it alleviates ""crankiness"" from my old knees ;)"
3,I guess it works well for other symptoms but not for chondromalasya.,"I have chondromolasya, cartilage dame in the knees. I took this medication for 3 weeks and did not see any improvement. Don't get me wrong, i've heard people have had great results for joint pain when using glucosamine but it apparently doesn't work well for chondromalasya."
1,Not for me!,I guess everyone's body is different. I kept breaking out with really bad rash on my knuckles and ankles after the second-third week. I gave the bottle away to my friend; gave him the warning.
1,Be Warned: Contains Shellfish!!!,"First of all, I am a very frequent shopper on amazon.com; however I did not purchase this product here. I logged on here to find information after my purchase.When ordering I did not see any reference at all for shellfish. I always look, as I would have a severe allergic reaction if I consumed it in any form or amount. Then the product arrived and, as always, I read the label. Down at the bottom, ""CONTAINS SHELLFISH (SHRIMP, CRAB) INGREDIENTS.I went back to review the information online to double check and see if it was my oversight. Apparently not. Just since my order date of March 8, the store I bought from has discontinued the product. So have several other sites. On the few that are still carrying Optimum Nutrition Glucosamine Plus CSA Super Strength, NONE discloses there is shellfish content - including here. This is a real problem for people with allergic reaction. If I could give this product a worse rating that 1 star, I surely would."
2,This shampoo didn't seem to work as well ...,"This shampoo didn't seem to work as well as regular Head and Shoulders for me. I seemed to have more flaking and my hair didn't have as much body as usual. I liked the idea of economy size bottle, but it'd be much easier to use with a pump."
3,Bitter/Sweet,I thought this movie was only so-so. I thought the script could have been better. The cinamatography was ok; but the most I could give this film is 3 stars.
1,"Overacted, dripping with saccharine, B grade movie","Yikes, I can not believe the other reviews - this movie was pretty terrible except for James Brolin who hardly appears in the movie. I found myself cringing when certain actors were about to speak. Silly script, consistent overacting by most of the actors, mood-breaking happy-a$$ music - truly a B grade movie. For those who enjoy lampooning such things - you may enjoy it for that reason but stay away otherwise.On the positive side, the Thai scenery was pretty and the opening credit scene of coffee being made was beautifully done."
2,It didn't meet my expectation.,"I have the same opinion with the reader from Philadelpia.I think this book has just very simple, common rules of McKinsey and some rules is already well known to public. The book doen't explain good method, tools Mckinsey has.There are no details. When he introduces 'MECE', he should have explained the 'Logic Tree' in detail. But he didn't.I think the rank of sales results from only the name value, 'Mckinsey' and marketing effortsSo I would not like to recommend this book."
1,Another marketing effort without much value,"This book is a sad example of bad and desperate marketing. It is an unbelievable collection of boring examples, poor analysis, repeated well-known frameworks, and lots of consulting self-esteem!"
3,Not bad - could be better,"Being a management consultant myself - I found the book to be relevant but not too detailed. For instance, there should be more examples of the first 3 principles : fact based, structure of problem solving and hypothesis driven. Albeit this, it is an easy-to-read book and it does outline the pains and gains of a consultant's life with particular spotlight on the McKinsey and Co, which is undoubtedly an impressive firm. It is a great book for the uninitiated who wants to catch a glimpse at McKinsey - but it may not be as useful to insight-searching-people who have been in the industry for some time (or managers in that sense)."
4,A quick read; A good framework,"If your looking for specific case studies or a ""drilled down"" discussion, you generally will not find it with this book. It does, however, give some good general guidelines for conducting research, problem solving, presenting, and client interaction. As with most general or somewhat abstract models, this book provides general principles that can be applied specifically to your current situation. For example, the processes involved in data collection, brainstorming, issue analysis, hypothesis construction, etc., can be applied to any topic in any area. I found the writing style easy to read and concise, with minimal amounts of obfuscation. Basically, it seems to me, the bedrock of the Mckinsey way is long hours, data distillation, and thorough and exhausive data collection. All told, I found it a worthwhile read."
2,Ironic,"Like the firm itself, the draw of this book is the McKinsey name, and the perception that they *must* know something special. Content-wise you could do better with the user manual for your HP 12C calculator. If the book serves any useful purpose it's to strip a little more of the paint off the McKinsey facade. Read it, but check it out from the library because there's nothing in it you will want to reference later."
3,An easy to read book into the workings of McKinsey,"Very readeable book that was enjoyable and and showed insights into the workings of McKinsey. Ethan gave a step by step guide into the workings of a McKinsey-ite.This could be used by other consultants,businesspersons and the steps are easy to follow. It would add much more value if there were more examples and tactics used.But overall,an easy read into the workings of McKinsey."
2,"Light weight. - wait for the paperback, or library.","The admitted ""meat"" of the book is about 35 pages. Some of these with about 4 - 5 lines of type. It could use a better or more attentive editor. Pick up a copy at a local bookstore and try to make sense of the last sentence of page 30."
2,Average,This guide was average at best. It certainly didn't give any real insight into what McKinsey does. A truly insightful guide to McKinsey is the Vault Reports Guide on McKinsey.
2,"Obviously, this book is merely a marketing effort","I had great expectations about this book. After all, McKinsey consultants enjoy a very good reputation. However, I was amazed to find this book extremely superficial. I hope this is not the type of analysis that this consulting firm does. Obviously, this book is just a marketing effort, not an intellectual exercise."
3,"Not bad for early in your career, expected more.","I thought the book had some good pointers if you are early in your career or just taking on your first leadership position. Overall I thought it was a bit simplistic and expected more. If you previously spent any time in consulting, you'd recognize most of the book as good traits successful consultants exhibit."
3,Not just McKinsey's way,"A good concept for a book. McKinsey are clearly the worlds most secretive consulting firm. However, Raisel's interpretation of their uniqueness is somewhat limited by his experience. For those readers out their who have worked in a consulting or professional services firm you will find alot of motherhood in this book which has been jazzed up as wow factor genius of McKinsey.That said there are a few gems in this book too. For those who have heard of McKinsey methods such as the hypothesis driven approach, and the elusive waterfall diagram this book explains all."
3,This book says little about McKinsey and a lot about consulting,"As with other readers and reviewers, I was quite disappointed by this book. It does not provide the insight into the McKinsey company that I was hoping and expecting. Sure it tells you that they work very hard and burn out very fast, while learning at the clients expense. But, it does not really talk about the company, instead it focusses on how to do consulting.I did think that there were some interesting insights into the way the company undertakes assignments and the structure that they apply to them. There were also a number of other small take aways that at least justified the team in reading it - just! But if you are looking to learn about the company, its history and success then this is not the book for you."
2,Don't Be Misled: It's Also Too General for a 2nd Year Undergrad,"As you probably know if you're reading this, if you search for anything ""McKinsey"" or ""consulting"" this book is often at the top of your search results, and as you also probably know if you've been looking for a good book on McKinsey, nothing else promises what this provocative title does. I read the reviews and I thought I knew what to expect. Many people said the book was filled with generalities and wasn't useful to anyone with graduate or real world business experience. I took that into consideration but being a 2nd year undergrad I thought I should find at least a few enlightening ideas. Some people even recommend it as useful for the ""16-21"" crowd, but I would charge even for the average achiever in college the book falls short of expectations and is not worth owning. I'd recommend skimming a borrowed copy though, just to satisfy your temptation for a glimpse at the ""McKinsey Way""."
4,So you wanna be a consultant ?,"As the title suggests this book gives a bird's eye view of the life, trials and tribulations of ""the firm"". Nothing earth shattering here, and probably everyone can write one after leaving their company (will we see more of ""the so-and-so way"" types of book) after interviewing some more ""alumni""...But a good book to whoever to know more about the life of a ""strategy consultant"" and was afraid or did not know where to ask!"
4,"Very high level, but good basics","I would agree with readers who point out the lack of deapth AND those that enjoyed the birds eye view. If you're looking for a book that archives the detailed business practices of McKinsey, look elsewhere. If you would like a birds eye view into the operations of a large strategic consulting firm, read on. It is a fast read. It is not a detailed study. It does leverage the McKinsey name."
1,"This is a simplistic, egotistical view of consulting","I bought this book hoping to get an insiders view on how McKinsey continues to demonstrate value to the top leaders in the world of business- what I got was a simplistic, egotistical view with no practical takeaways. The author exhibits no depth in dicussion, offering inane 'innovations' such as flip charts and the like. The book comes off more as 'how we overcharge our clients' than 'what we can do to add value'"
3,Pretty good blocking and tackling book for line managers,"I read both of Raisel's McKinsey books. If you can cut through the McKinsey arrogance and the endless references to the number of hours McKinsey consultants work, it is pretty good reading.The books are written for line managers and are appropriately prescriptive and basic. As an organizational consultant I have never sat down to write out my diagnostic analyses and outputs. This documents many of the analyses I use and will help me better communicate with my clients. These books will help people in HR, IS, Training, and other functions who are looking to become value-added ""business partners"" collect data and analyze problems as internal consultants. If another book comes out I will read it as well. But please, no more references to late night Chinese dinners."
3,"Readable, light advice from interviewing McKinsey people","This book is arranged in many extremely brief sections, each of which makes a point or two at a very general level. A useful collection of approaches that a novice may find helpful, but without tough case studies or any special insight into McKinsey.I found the last two sections quoting the most important and the most memorable experiences of various McKinsey employees the most interesting parts.Read it if you are interested in management consulting and want a book you can scan in short sessions."
2,McKinsey Lite...very Lite,"Possibly a good book for someone fresh out of school, with little management experience or someone just assigned their first consulting type project. Any moderately experienced manager will not likely learn much from this book. Do we really need a list of things to pack for a business trip. Best quote, "" Remember that the interviewee (client) probably knows a lot more about her business than you (consultant) do..."" p.84 and almost the same statement on p.80."
4,Useful to beginners/intermediates,This book shall be useful to beginners/intemediates (1-3 yrs experience) in business planning/analysis/consultation work. It is simple. Not technical. With ample examples about people engagement. You can add on your personal experiences to make the learning more interactive & effective.
3,Straight & Simple,"In this book, the writer puts you through a McKinsey Boot-camp and shows what it means to be fact-based, structured, and hypothesis-driven. However, dont expect this book to provide anything extraordinary from any other management consultant's methods and perspectives just because its got the McKinsey name on it. Perhaps what the writer is trying to convey is exactly that -- a successful consultant is not just someone with the knowledge but the ability to share that knowledge in the most simplest form in assisting to solve clients' problems.The basic techniques shared is well-written and can be effective if well implemented. It provide managers and business owners some guidance on techniques of handling problems and tough strategic issues for those who cant afford the real McKinsey.The intro states: ""Think of this book as a sampler...read whatever items interest you"" Well, that's exactly what it is -- straight and simple!"
2,Hardly Earth Shattering; Pretty Basic Stuff,"Being keen to better understand McKinsey's formula for success, I was rather underwhelmed: very basic information which might be useful to a new graduate, but hardly earth shattering (check out the team building section for example, the summary for which amounts to 'treat your people nicely if you want them to keep working for you'). On the other hand, you do get some sense of McKinsey's internal workings (eg. getting assigned to a project, career development, etc).It's an easy read, a few hours at most, but unfortunately the true amount of useful information could be summarized in a first semester MBA student's 4-page book report."
1,Serious Lack of Useful Information -- Not worth reading,"... There is very, very little useful information. Much ofbook centers around how selective McKinsey is, which is commonknowledge. There is almost a total lack of how strategies particular to McKinsey can be applied to solving business problems. END"
1,"Its full of common consulting, no McKinzey way consulting.","There are a couple of really good books on general consulting process - much better than Mr Rasiel's. Mr Rasiel has just cheated the customers in getting them to purchase the book by putting the 'McKinsey' name on it. Other than on the cover, there is no'McKinsey way' inside the book. Its a fraud.I have a better mind than to agree with the author about the McKinsey Way! I am sure McKinsey is much better than what Mr Rasiel's book says. The author needs to be sued, for misleading the readers. I guess, he is a disgruntelled employee of McKinsey and very subtly made money off his employers organization and in the process, achieved his objective of tarnishing its image."
1,"I expected to go ""Wow"" but instead I went ""Huh?""","I bought this book because I am considering a career change from molecular biologist to management consulting and McKinsey & Co. is one of the firms that I am targeting. I call this book a case of ""Shameful brand exploitation"". It was truly an embarrassing read!"
2,Not really the McKinsey way,"This book claims to provide an insight into the skills and tactics that McKinsey consultants use. However, it rarely goes beyond generalities i.e. you would find some business concepts that business school grads (and many others) would be well aware of. Not really the McKinsey way."
5,Excellent Read for any Business professional,"This book is excellent in that it gives the reader an inside look at the culture of McKinsey and Co. as well as some practical insight to complex problem solving.The nice thing about this book is that it doesn't have to be read in order, but you can sample different sections of the book, as the author explains, ""like a box of chocolates."" Truly delicious it is, giving us the 80/20 rule, which really rings true, and the elevator test which are both great rules for any profession. You also get McKinsey unique approach to problem solving as well as some great McKinsey stories.Also,if you're an MBA student and considering career options, this is a must read."
2,The Wrong Way,"Though the author offers a few unique insights into the way the world's premier consultancy operates (such as the thirty-second test where one has to tell his boss all key suggestions between floors in an elevator), a two minute conversation with someone who has worked at McKinsey would do the same, if not better. The only true way to understand the ""McKinsey Way"" is to hone up your interviewing skills and try to land yourself a job. Otherwise, if you are only interested in business advice and presentation skill enhancement, there are countless other books to read."
1,A collection of repetitions and buzz words,"After a very bad experience hiring a McKinsey team, I was hoping that the quality of the firm under other circumstances would be better. However, if this book reflects the depth and insightfulness of that firm consulting worldwide, I am convinced that these people do not have anything new to offer to the corporate world."
1,"Filled with conventional wisdom, definitely not worth the $","This book reminded me of term papers I used to write: wide margins, lots of white space, big font, and much repetition. I bought it because I thought it might provide insight, instead I was bombarded with conventional wisdom. I think the author is brilliant; he is going to make some money by throwing a book together in a week or so and adding the McKinsey name to make sure it sells. I bought this book at the airport in London, so I can't take it back. If anyone wants a copy, pay the shipping and I'll send it to you."
3,OK but...,"It was OK, but I really expected a lot more depth in terms of problem solving advice, advanced client management skills, practical examples of ideas that worked and were carried through etc.The book was arranged in five sections, and really, should have only been the first three, and far more depth in each of those three should have been provided. Did we really need to hear McKinsey folk recommend that we take a toothbrush and an extra shirt when we travel? The entire fourth act could have been spent elaborating, explaining and going through some key lessons.It does score points for its every-man language and easy readability however."
1,nothing you couldn't guess,"this book was a complete disappointment. it claims to educate business professionals about The McKinsey Way of solving problems. Apparently this amounts to gathering data before proposing a solution and other obvious sentiments. I'm sure McKinsey is a great company, but there are better examples of strategic thinking than those found here."
3,Full of Generalities,"This book is nothing special because it contains no revolutionary\evolutionary business concepts that are unique. To be sure, it contains lot of good business anecdotes you will find in most business books. But if you want to find out what makes McKinsey's business practice so special and so much better than its competitors, the book leaves a lot wanting. Furthermore, the book is full of generalities, for example, the chapter on interviewing for facts was nice, but again, nothing special. You would be far better off buying specialty books on such matters. I think this would be a good book to buy if you want to enter into consulting or are looking to work for McKinsey. For others, however, the book does not break any new ground nor provides any brainstromy insights. Rather, it is full of nice business generalities and suggestions."
3,"should have been called ""what it's like to work at McK""","This is a good book about what it is like to work as a management consultant, but not a very good book about how to think like one. I liked a lot of this book, such as his explanation of how to conduct an interview. I also liked his discussion about working late producing documents.However, many parts of this book were useless (the section on charts basically tells you to read the book ""Say it with Charts""), and others were wrong (the example used for MECE was actually not mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive). Additionally, as a consultant who didn't travel or work very much at client sites, Rasiel couldn't give a complete picture of the consulting lifestyle.In short, this is an interesting read if you are thinking of joining a management consulting firm; it does a decent job describing one person's experience. But it isn't a good book on business in general, or even on the history of McKinsey."
1,No wonder the author left McKinsey,Not much more to say other than the book has very little insight into what management consulting is. Don't waste your money and your time.
2,Not a Must Read for Sure...,"I picked up the book with a hope of picking some cool fundas in Consulting and was very disappointed. I would put the book as a small collection of ""Common Sense"" and none of the methods to be really extra ordinary. But as people say ""Common Sense is not so common"", one can just quickly go through by borrowing the book. One thing I liked in the book is the importance of facts in Consulting. Couple of points mentioned at the begining justifying the need to focus was facts was interesting"
2,Not very interesting,"I was expecting much more insight about what it's like to work at McKinsey. For the most part, I thought this book was a waste of time."
4,Insightful!,"Ethan M. Raisel describes the problem-solving process used by McKinsey & Company, a well-known corporate consulting firm. The book offers easily digested tips. The insightful section on conducting interviews and the tips on building teamwork are particularly useful. However, because the author and other McKinsey consultants are prohibited by confidentiality agreements from discussing the specifics of their cases, the book lacks real-world examples of the firm's problem-solving approaches. We [...] recommend this book to managers seeking useful information and problem solving techniques."
2,Very Dissappointing,The book fails to delve in depth the ways of McKinsey Consulting. Lot of fluff. Very dissappointing reading.
5,"So Tenderly, Done So Beautifully",I first owned this recording in 1966 on a reel to reel tape which I purchased while stationed in the Philippines with the U.S. Navy. Needless to say the tape has been long gone but the memory of the songs on this album has stayed with me all these years. John Gary had the most wonderfully clear voice. His range is amazing and every word is articulated with precision. So very pleased this was available on CD and I was able to once again able to experience this man's rare gift.
2,The real story,"Pro's: It's a good, factual book about PT's in WWII. Cons: It's a good, factual book about PT's in WWII. Bulkley tells the story by theater of operation and mission. While ""At Close Quarters"" is obviously written by a guy who has been in action it tends to bog down with endless lists of PT numbers and crew names woven into each mission."
3,too big,"i usually take a medium and i swam in these. the neckline is very low. otherwise, ok. but not all that"
5,Beautiful!,"These are so comfortable and they are a steal at the price I paid! If you like designer clothing, you must have these!"
3,"Good, if you can get past the many opinions...","This is a very comprehensive guidebook and it's been a good resource, but...every introduction to each section seems to include some unrealistic and paternalistic desire for Kenya to return to its Out of Africa roots. Too much industrialization, this is too touristy, is it eco-friendly? It's a bit much, but if you are looking for something informative that covers more than the Masai Mara and other luxury destinations, this is it."
4,great resource,"Even with having access to the internet, this book provided interesting insights on the culture and history as well as suggestions for places to go that were not necessarily a touristy highlight. The book is organized by regions- has great explanations for what to anticipate- the prices were a bit off, which can be expected- but the cultural insights and attractions were very accurate. It allowed a dialogue with local tour agencies and the hotel we stayed in to negotiate our excursions & transportation- the hotel & travel agencies had a tendency to push certain things and not recommend others that the book suggested. We hired a driver to take us from Nairobi to other places in Kenya that were, at the most, 3 hrs away. Having a written reference allowed for a ready resource throughout the trip."
5,Best travel guide I've used in years,"I just got back from a driving trip through Kenya and this guide was fantastic! The city maps were excellent. The hotels were what I expected after reading the reviews and most of the recommended restaurants were as good as described. I've used many travel guides over the years and this was one of the best. The only thing I would add is info on the mileage between towns and perhaps some info on parking security at hotels for those of us who are driving. Anyway, kudos to the author and my thanks for making our trip a pleasure. A good travel guide really makes a difference as I realized to my dismay when I had to switch to another guide for Uganda which was deficient in so many of the above respects."
4,Comprehensive,"Best map I've seen of Kenya. It's lacking in detail for certain areas, but that's to be expected with a map for an entire country, especially such an underdeveloped one. Still more detailed than any other map of Kenya I've seen. Not entirely accurate, but good enough. Buy this if you'll be driving yourself around Kenya or are using public transport, or if you just want to learn more about this geographically diverse country. Goes great with a guidebook."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NEW MODEL WII'S,"Beware that the latest model of Wii, the ""Family Edition"" that is currently bundled with Super Mario Bros. Wii is not compatible with this adapter. More specifically, the latest Wii lacks Gamecube support altogether, there are no Gamecube controller ports or memory card sockets. That's not a fault of this product, however it is a critical detail for new customers.There is another product on the market that lets you plug PS2 controllers into the Wiimote, it's just called a ""PS2 to Wii Converter"". I would look into that instead."
2,new to this,"i just received mine, and i guess im blind or a newbie but i cant find a place to plug the ting in on my wii. didntnt include much for instructions or troubleshooting either."
3,Works with DDR on the Wii but...,"Bought this so we could use our Gamesis DDR gamepads with DDR games on the Wii. It did allow them to work. But, you have to enable DDR mode to get it to work. The process is a bit cumbersome. First, you have to leave the Wii powered off before you connect the joybox (which is a pain when you forget or were playing something else first). Second, you have to hold three buttons on the pad down simultaneously... Not sure about the people that made this, but I only have two feet, so that's also a bit inconvenient. The unit doesn't remember DDR mode, so you have to do this every time... and have to try to remember which 3 buttons to hold down, which will be a real ""joy"" when you lose the instructions. Why didn't they put this information on a label on the back of the unit? Never used it with regular PS2 controllers for any other game, so can't comment on that."
3,PS 2 to GC Converter Review,This product works flawlessly on the gamecube but I ran into problems when I tried on the Wii. On the Wii the ps2 controller doesnt respond at all in some games like MK:A. This was kind of sad since I bought it for the very purpose of playing fightnig games better
5,Works great for DDR!,"I took a chance on this not knowing much about it, and I'm glad I did! I bought this to connect my Red Octane PS2 dance pad to the Wii, and it works just great. A bit complicated to set up until you get used to it (don't lose the instructions in case you forget!), but I've been using it for a few months and have had no problems with any of the connections working."
3,Some good parts and some really weak parts,"Some of the excercises are very helpful and useful but some of them are just filler. The weight lifting excercises are a good example of the filler. The excercises are shown but nothing is put in to workouts.I have to admit though, the stretching/flexability section is great."
1,Major Letdown!!!,"I own three other Turtle Press DVDs and this one I am highly disappointed in. They did not describe this once clearly to me, because this was not what I was expecting; they should have left it was a book because with how they have it organized you will have to do a large amount of starting, stopping, and fast forwarding to skip all of the unnecessary filler. Some of the exercises they describe doing you are unable to do in your home. I personally do not recommend this DVD. If people are looking to become very flexible I would recommend the Ultimate Flexibility DVD because it has greatly increased mine."
3,Ultimate Fitness,"This DVD was not clearly described when I purchased it, and it was not what I was expecting when I watched it. I think it could be beneficial, but there is a lot of filler and requires fast-forwarding through some parts. I don't think it's really worth what I paid for it."
5,EXCELLENT FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF WAR,"This is a much overlooked classic now days. Mr. Mowat has given us a vivid first hand account of his expierences during WWII and this book ranks at the top of such works. Not only do we get a first hand view of the actual fighting (found in many/most accounts), but we also see the other side of the war. The horrible loneliness and boredom. Mr. Mowat is an acute observer of human nature, something he uses with a cutting edge in this book. For this amature historian of this period, and those just passingly interested, this is a good read and I highly recommend it."
4,"A good book, but not a great book","I didn't really want to read another war book, but a friend convinced me he thought this was the best one ever written. However, I came away from it thinking it wasn't as good as ""The Forgotten Soldier"". The last chapter about the battle over the Moro river was just as good. However, the depth of the first three chapters I felt was diminished by the author's sense of humor and his tendency to exaggerate. For example, the dying of the inscrutable A K Long - taking out his pipe for a smoke and a book to read when he was so seriously wounded, calm in the midst of terror - struck me as unrealistic. In sum, this was a good book but I would say, not really memorable."
5,Donnie Brasco -My undercover life in the mafia,"Great book. Real life stuff and best of all, it was made into a movie. Very easy to read. Fast reader."
5,One of the best Mafia books ever written,"The book was based on the true life events of agent Joseph D. Pistone, and is nothing short of perfection. It tells the story of the real mafia life, which is not often portrayed on paper. Agent Pistone's book takes the reader into the life of the capo's and the soldiers of the Bonanno family. Its is a very interesting book, and also a great fim starring Al Pacino and Michael Madsen. I work in a bookstore, and have read numerous mafia books, and this is one of my favorites."
4,"The Flip Side of ""Goodfellas""","Joe Pistone is a real American Hero. The former F.B.I agent spent six Years deep undercover as Donnie Brasco, a jewel thief, and infiltrated the Mafia, penetrating it's upper eschalon and bringing their power structure crashing down around their heads, resulting in over 100 convictions...Pistone, along with Richard Woodley, does a great job of bringing real-life Wiseguys like ""Lefty Guns"", ""Sonny Black"", and Tony Mirra to life on the printed page, and even though I know Pisone survived his ordeal (He obviously did- He wrote the book!), I was still constantly worried about him. Any fan of true-crime will love Donnie Brasco!"
4,thrilling,"i was afraid for donnie every time he had to wear the wire. it really was a good, exciting story. the movie had to have one of the all time worst endings, tho. the book was cool."
4,Wonderful!,This is a great book that details Joseph Pistone's infiltration of the mob as Donnie Brasce. Also check out the movie with the same name. It will leave you on the edge of your seat.
2,How to waste a one-in-a-million talent,"Lorez Alexandria is one of the most underrated singers in American Jazz History. She had a fantastic voice, so much feeling in her readings and could swing like mad. For some reasons, she never received the recognition she deserved. This CD contains her two late 60s albums for PZAZZ records. With some exceptions (""I'm Wishin'"", ""Help Me"",) this is no 'must have'. Too many confusing Jive/Blues/Rock etc.etc.etc. arrangements, too much end 60s-Sarah Vaughan or Roberta Flack style singing, especially on the second album. She should have followed her own greatness, no need for her to copy any other style. Compare this to ""Alexandria, The Great"", her '64 IMPULSE! album--and you know what I mean."
2,I expected better from OTC,"The ratchet mechanism that holds the pliers (once you pinch a hose) won't holdthem shut. The pliers pop open with minimal pressures/movement.Could be fixed by filing the notches in the ratchet, but I haven't tried that yet.Disappointed-- I expected better quality out of OTC."
4,They work!,"These work just fine. Adequate construction and the mechanism functions properly. Not big enough to pinch off large hoses but work fine on 1"" heater hose. Just what I needed."
3,Cute CD for Hawaiian and Haole keiki alike!,"I liked this CD, with artists like the Ka'au Crater Boys, Na Leo Pilimihana, and Keali'i Rachel you can't go wrong. It's even got one of my favorite songs, ""Opihi Man"" and a paniolo song!Nalu Keiki Kane"
5,Not having this book could be dangerous!,"Over 400 pages of concise, encyclopedic information on vitamins, minerals, drugs, chemicals in food that could help benefit or harm pregnant mother and baby. A must-have!"
4,"AMAZING Sound, Very please with this purchase","So I've been looking for a while now for a set of speakers that are cost effective but not a heap of junk in the sound sense. I found them right here. These speakers are great. Granted they run off of 4 AAA batteries and my ipod (4th generation)doesn't really set right in the little platform for it. BUT the sound is more than worth it. The speakers work great for low level music at my desk to blaring over the shower in my bathroom. I am BEYOND please with this purchase. So to recap:Pros-Great soundcord wraps neatly around the device in a grove just for it.When folded the speakers are a nice compact little square.Cons-Doesn't run off of device battery, but 4 AAAs instead.stand/platform for device is really more of a sliding box (But if your device has the headphone jack on the side or on top it shouldn't make a difference.)"
4,A pleasant surprise,For the very low price I did not expect much.But it works just fine. Also the fold-upportability is convenient. Recommend it.
4,Very good!,These speakers sound better than I expected. I used them on a trip on batteries and the sound was very good. These are the same speakers that are included in some of the accessory bundles.
4,Great speaker for the money,Bought these because of portability and small size. They are good for small spaces. I can find nothing wrong or that I dislike about them.
1,So bad I threw them away,I got these and the sound was so tinny and the highest volume level you could turn them up to was so low that I ended up throwing them away.
2,Everybody is stupid,"I really don't understand the appeal of thrice. They are technically quite impressive, but couldn't slap together a good song if their lives depended on it. And their singer is horribly whiney and incoherent. this whole album is just a mess. avoid this!"
2,Another good band falls victum of modern day emo crap.,"I'm going to be straight up, the title says it all. Thrice was a great band, Illusion of Safety is one of the most incredable albums ever. Now they sound like every other band out there today. Personally I Hate emo, I grew out of that crap along time ago. I'm sorry if I offend people in saying that. I just dont see any talent in it. Thrice used to be my favorite band. Being a guitarist myself, I enjoyed Identity Crisis' true hardcore sound, and Illusion of Safety's amazing creativity, but the Artist in the Ambulance and this new CD are crap. If your emo, then give it a shot, but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you can't avoid every time you turn on the radio, put this album back. It's time to move on Thrice fans. They came.. they rocked.. there done."
1,Suck,Bands like this truly make me furious. This is not what rock is about. Rock is about haven a good time not lying on track and letting wolves tear you apart. Thats gay if you think that this compares in anyway to your life than you are severly screwed up and you ve got big issues. Listen to some AC/DC and Van Halen or even led Zepplin or kiss or Ramones then you will get a taste of rocknRoll at its finest gothic hsve screwed up rocknroll in the sence that they all want to die and are all against athoritie you cannot have it both ways. Rock is not a way to express yourself and if you paid 1 cent for this albun then you are quickining th end of rock as weknow it.
2,talented but not particularly creative,"I really dislike the direction most punk has taken in the last few years, now that it has become a radio genre. There is nothing different style-wise that Thrice offers versus any of the ... you hear on the radio. It's the same, lame formula.The only reason they get two stars is because they play their instruments with a lot of energy and talent... but if you are a long-time fan of punk, are tired of what is being generally consumed by the public, and are looking for something new... this isn't it...."
5,Genre-Defining Album,"This is a must-buy for any fan of post-hardcore, punk, and emo music. Thrice puts time and effort into each song, and it shows. There are no fillers here. I can listen to every song and not skip one. Musically, Thrice is very talented and showcases this often. I was most impressed with their lyrics, however. Every song has a message and deeper meaning. I will sit and think of things that Dustin (the writer) was trying to say... Overall, a must-buy for any fan of the genre."
5,wow,"this album is great, i have listened to the illusion of safety 1000+ times and it is still enjoyable. trust is the only song that i wish wasn't on this album. buy it you wont regret it!"
4,"Wow, I really like this.","Good workout music. I heard about Thrice from a Saves the Day website a while back. Wow, how different they are from STD, but how right the guy was that said ""they rocked."" The vocals range from smooth and melodic to raspy and powerful. And the music is pulsating and intense. So basically, if you have ever wanted to know what it would sound like if you combined Finch with Keepsake...go get some Thrice. They won't dissapoint you. This is a quality album by a quality band."
4,I really got great benefits from using this ...,"I really got great benefits from using this shampoo! It's a wonderful product and it got rid of my ugly and embarrassing dandruff. I really would recommend this product to anyone with dandruff. It's not a drying shampoo. It leaves my hair smelling great, very manageable, and quite healthy! I'm not a professional hair stylist, but I go around recommending the product on a daily basis! A great cure for dandruff!"
2,BEWARE!!!,"I've had this tv for about 15 months. Up until about a week ago this tv was total greatness. BUT now I am beside myself I am so livid and doubt I'll get another Sony anything!! It's become almost impossible to watch because the tv loses picture and sound for about 30 seconds and then it comes back. The standby light blinks about 38-42 times while this is going on. Sony ""customer support"" was no help and it's likely to fix it is going to cost an exhorbitant amount of money. This is the second Sony tv I've had crap out on me like this."
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR : Know what you're getting yourself into.,"First let me say that the sound quality and the picture quality are above average for televisions made at this time. But it would be irresponsible for someone to sell you this television with telling you about the known issues associated with this model. First and foremost, the optical block will not last very long. This is the main image creating device for this model. To replace and/or fix the model will cost upwards of a thousand dollars. Also, the bulbs only last a few years if you're lucky, and those run around 150-250 a piece, depending on whether you buy factor or after-market parts, and if there is service involved.Do a google search about the 'optical block' and 'Sony Grand WEGA' or 'kdf-55wf655' for yourself before buying this one. It's a shame because when it does work, it really has a beautiful picture."
2,Buyer beware,Sony tvs have a design fault in the optical block that is uneconomical to repair. There was a big class action lawsuit. Sony showed itself to be a company with no real care for its customers. We are out $3500 after only 6 years of tv use. We also have 2 Sony cameras that failed prematurely. Sony does not equal the quality we all thought they were.
3,"Not bad, not great","Great TV except in high light areas. Works best in a dark place. Also, it doesn't do well with fast motion HD such as sports. There is a lot of pixelation. But while watching HD in low light areas, it's terrific. I'm replacing the lamp now though after only 3.5 years. I guess this is a normal time with normal use. But dropping $200 on a new lamp is annoying. I can't wait until the lamp goes again. Then I can justify upgrading to a Plasma or LCD.I would reccomend this TV to a friend if the price is right."
2,"Dull, duller, dullest",A deadly dry Ph.D thesis which attempts to marry a dull account of an exciting team with various analogies to developments in 19th century American history. Good photos though.
3,Introduction to the greatest in French classical literature,"I purchased this thinking it was a course in learning how to speak French. My mistake. It's got some decent selections, but wasn't what I was looking for. I may change this review after I finish reading the collection, but thought I'd post my experience as there isn't much on the page to indicate otherwise for the casual browser."
3,French text needed in the book,The book gives a summary of some French work in English. I would prefer to have the original texts as well. So if one wants to have some talking pints about French classics this book helps. For learning the real material one should look somewhere else.
2,TOO EXPENSIVE GARMIN DATA CARD,It is unbelievable to sell a 512 Mb Memory Card for US$ 125. I have no other option and I have to buy it for my Garmin but I consider them thieves.
5,Wonderful Boots,These are very warm and comfortable boots. It's been a while since I owned a pair of boots and these have proven to be a good buy!
4,Maybe the best Dylan picture book ever!,"A great book freaturing many great photos of Dylan during his first ""prime"". The photographs by Marshall and Kramer have been in print since the dawn of time, a big disappionment from those two photographers. Barry Fienstein was along for most of the 5/66 tour and his pictures are mostly brand new and very very exiting. I was a little disappionted by the lack of preformance pictures included, but that's a minor gripe. Overall an essential picture book for any Dylan fan, new or old.Note: Barry Feinstein's pictures graced the booklet that went with the CD ""Bob Dylan, Live 1966"". He could have easily made a much, much more exiting book if all the ""standard"" pictures from Kramer and Marshall were replaced by more of Feinstein's unseen amazing photographs."
3,METAL INSTRUCTION CD,"Thats exactly what I bought this for. There's some pretty good improv in the CD. Forget the songs. Its the awesome improvising you're after. The track ""howling"" is what the CD could've been if he focussed on showcasing his skill without the cheesy backing tracks.""Howling"" ranks up there with ""Stratovarious"" by Greg Howe in the instrumental solo music category.This CD is not for general consumption."
5,Surrender: The Heart God Controls,"This is an excellent book. I haven't read it all yet, but if you have asked Jesus to be your Savior, you should understand that He also needs to be your Lord - and that's Lord over everything! This book gives great insights to some of the things we hold back from God which really need to be relinquished. I highly recommend it."
3,I like the fact it is a shampoo ...,"I like the fact it is a shampoo and conditioner in one. It's made my hair very soft and easy to manage after shampooing. However, it left my hair with static electricity that made it hard to handle late in the day. I would continue using this shampoo but would alternate it with some other brands."
3,The first thing I noticed about the shampoo ...,"The first thing I noticed about the shampoo was the wonderful fresh scent. But I felt the shampoo left my hair feeling slightly heavy and dirty by the end of the day. My hair tends to be very oily, so possibly the oily hair version would have suited me better than the normal version. This shampoo sells for a very reasonable price and I'd probably recommend it to my """"non-oily haired"""" friends."
2,I like the idea of a conditioner and ...,"I like the idea of a conditioner and shampoo in one but Pert Plus didn't do well in my hair. First of all, it didn't lather well. Then I needed to shampoo my hair twice to work up a good lather. It did rinse out well. Right after I shampooed with Pert Plus my hair felt soft and light, but the next day, it felt heavy and looked like it needed to be shampooed. I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,I didn't really care for it because it ...,"I didn't really care for it because it seemed to overcondition my hair, making it feel like it needed to be washed soon after I washed it. I wash my hair daily and don't condition it daily, so it's not suitable for me. However, if you do use a conditioner daily, it may do the job for you. The scent is nice and it lathers well."
1,Not what I expected,"These cards were smaller than what I expected so I was disappointed. I will probably not buy cards on line in the future,"
5,Great Gaming Resource,"I've been with SWRPG ever since 2nd Edition came out, and I have to say that the R&E book is well worth the investment. It clears up a lot of grey areas that were present in the 2nd Edition book and has much greater resources from a beginning gamer's point of view. It also offers many fresh perspectives to those who have some experience with the game. All around, a worthwhile purchase."
4,Good RPG,"This book is a really good RPG, and holds true to the Star Wars books and movies as much as an RPG can be expected to. This RPG is almost as good as AD&D in its detail and playability. I recommend this to anyone who likes RPGs in general, and especially to those who like Star Wars."
3,"Much Improved, But with flaws.","I have been playing the game for three years, and have a library of books only on the RPG. I have the basic second edition book, and while the ""revised and expanded"" version is more user friendly, has more pictures, and covers information that used to be found only in scourcebooks, it does have some flaws. The skills are difficult to locate, and it's not as easy to read because of the lay out. Also, some of the minor rules are difficult to find, and some I couldn't find at all (Rules for healing with out the use of a medpac for example). I'm sure they're in there somewhere, I just couldn't find them. For a Star Wars Fan, it's a good 4 or 5 star book. For the gamer, I'd still stick with my old 2nd edition."
4,PDG - Pretty Damn Good,"Of all the Roleplaying games out, i was glad to see one that successfully game from a movie universe. Unlike MiB and the such, this was a good book and i found it to be quite accurate. I was also glad to see a very good sci-fi rpg rather than another fantasy one. The game is also good in that it kept up with supplements and was able to expand the universe. The game was in depth and accurate, but has great playability and is quite easy to learn. After one or two games of playing, one gets the hang of it and understands the rules very well. It is also very easy to game master and this book helps. And Wizards of the Coast do not make AD&D you nut job Benjamin. TSR makes AD&D. Wizards of the coast makes card games, numbnutz!"
5,"Beauty, simplicity, perfection...too much?","Having played and gamemastered Star Wars RPG for several years, I grew accustomed to the old 2nd edition manual. When mine was destroyed, I was skeptical of this more expensive clone. It IS a little different; however, superlatively well designed and with stunning graphics that left me, as a Star Wars fan, wishing I would have fed my dog the old book earlier. Full colour original drawings and screen shots from the movies, along with quick start text, make this great for beginners. Players may enjoy the more detailed descriptions of weapons, skills and equipment. However, for the seasoned veteran of Imperial Combat, the poor arrangement and over simplification of rules can be frustrating. The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type game intro is 'Dog Lame,' but the parody advertisements are cool enough to hang in the den."
4,Become a Jedi in three easy steps!,"Star Wars... those who love it REALLY love it! The chance to roleplay in the star wars setting is great, and I'm pleased to say that this book offers the perfect entry point. Experienced and new players alike will find it's chatty, light hearted style easy to swallow and packed with information. The book breaks down the rules and processes of creating a character and writing adventures into manageable chunks, and never loses sight of its source material, emphasising plot and character over dice and tables. Don't be put off by the ""Inconsistencies"" mentioned in some reviews- they are tiny, and mostly due to Lucasfilm's tendency to alter or contradict itself on points that aren't considered ""canon"", ie. the stuff in the actual movies.The advice and information within far outweigh these niggles. In all, a corker!"
5,The Hot Rock does.,"""I am not the captain/I am just another fan"" sings Corin Tucker in ""The End of You"",the third track of the Hot Rock, and this statement perfectly epitomizes Sleater-Kinney's approach to making records: keep playing awesome music, not for the money or the fame or the record companies, but because you honestly love it. Taking into account this DIY-ethos, one can't help but be in awe of the superb craftmanship of The Hot Rock. Produced by Roger Moutenot, it has a decidedly different tone than the other S-K records. Whereas AHOTBO and Dig Me Out are full-frontal sonic assaults, the Hot Rock is much more obtuse, with guitar lines intertwining like vines and dual vocals so different that Corin's wales eventually seem to become shadowed by Carrie's hushed whispers. From the giddy ""Get Up"" single to full on punk love song ""One Song For You"", the Hot Rock is by far one of not only Sleater-Kinney's best, but rock and roll's as well."
4,Thaddeus was burnt by the Hot Rock,"An album of staggering power and brute force. Corin Tucker's vocal thrashing strikes to your soul. The guitar work of Carrie Brownstein leaves you utterly slack jawed. I always hate trying to tell people about a musical experience, because we have such a limited vocabulary so the album reviews all sound the same . . . all I can really say, is if you've never heard of Sleater Kinney and you like taking risks on Indie rock, this is a safe bet (angry chick rock makes me feel warm and fuzzy), and if you are already fan, why don't you own this already? For those of you who don't know Sleater-Kinney, every album is a good buy. They're all mindblowing works of extraordinary precision and, well, fun- it's absolutely impossible to listen with the volume down, you must turn it up. Buy it today, thank your bank later."
3,Over-rated,"This is a good record, but don't believe the hype around it. Worth a listen, but hardly album of the year or anything."
1,Disapointed,"I bought this record with high hopes and was very disapointed. I'm sorry, I just didn't get it. I love this kind of music, but I can't hear the things people seem to love about this record. I'll be selling my copy of ""The Hot Rock""."
2,"Weak melodies, repetitious guitar lines and sleepy drumming","Put together a trio of girls who can shout, a couple of guitar players and a drum kit and you get raw and emotional rock'n'roll music. Well, not exactly. The result may be raw and emotional, but ""musical"" is a far stretch. The compositions on The Hot Rock lack structure and cohesion. It's acceptable that the girls can't hold a note and that their voices are flat, but that leaves all the songs with very weak melodies. Add repetitious guitar lines and a laidback drummer from the Lawrence Welk band . The listener is lost soon after the first 15-second introductions. Besides, Devo has been done before. Is there any point asking the Shaggs to do Devo? `Start Together' and `Don't Talk Like' are the only worthwhile efforts on The Hot Rock. Now you wait just a gosh darn minute Mr. Critic, if you'd only try to ""understand"" it, then you'd learn to ""appreciate"" it. Sorry. I ""understand"" headaches, but I still haven't learned to ""appreciate"" them."
2,not the same sleater-kinney....,"as a fan of earlier sleater-kinney (esp. dig me out, heavens to betsy) and other riotgrrl/punk, i found this to be a *huge* disappointment. i think the band lost their trademark rough, angry edge. the music is overproduced, trite, and generally uninteresting. three great musicians appear to have stepped back from the incredible force it seemed they were unleashing in their previous albums, and watered down their art for mass consumption. this album doesn't work for me at all, but if you just want background noise, this could be a banal addition to an unremarkable music collection. oh well."
1,so very over rated,"the critical acclaim this band has achieved is a sign of how little vital music is being produced today. tucker's voice is often annoying. they do rock some good riffs, but the songs blur together. a mediocre drummer, very limited guitar playing, comparisons to verlaine are strange since unlike verlaine no boundaries are pushed here, its just riffing. occasionally clever lyrics. not much fun. a very two dimensional band."
4,Music to mosh in your foyer to...,"This is by far the most accesible Sleater-Kinney disc yet. If you are the type that likes to hold on to the olden days of ""Pour on the power and lighten the load on the pop"" (admit it you are, you have the t-shirt, you want to be 20 and slumming through college again, fess up--it's a demon we all have to deal with) then you may be bewitched, bewildered and..um..bequeathed (?) by ""The Hot Rock."" This fella happens to dig the the thing. While no song matches ""One More Hour"" from the last CD, ""Dig Me Out"", songs here, such as ""Start Together"" and the title track, are some of the most tuneful and rhythmic stuff they've recorded. So maybe it's hard to pound your head against your dormitory wall to this disc, but I'll live (I'm not so sure the scars on my head would ever heal again anyway)."
4,great!,"Saw them last year in the UK, really thought they were excellentJust got round to getting this and I have to say that it is brilliant...melodic and intense. Was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the live show but it surpassed it..."
5,THE REAL HOT ROCK,"SLeater-Kinney is one of the few bands around these days in which everyone is really intirgued to know as to what they are doing next. Ever since i heard their style changed a bit, i was even more excited. AND all that aniticipation has paid off, maybe more in spades. First listen to the record is not completely the best. The songs could noodle away into another and you're left thinking they lost their edge. But after three more listens, this is one of the best albums of the year. The writing is more mature and not so much concerned with female politics. It is more concerned with politics of the heart. They have grown up some and gained a few more inspirations and lost some other trademark styles. I hope this album will tell fans that this is a band that will be sticking around for awhile and can still be exciting."
4,20' flag pole,"I received the 20' flag pole just fine and installed it according to the directions. Everything is great about the product, except the cleat mounting screws will not tighten up and I am afraid the cleat will come flying off while the flag is flying. I would suggest a backing plate be used to run the screws into as the thin walled aluminum tubing is not nearly substantial enough to hold the screws. If they could fix that, I would give it 5 stars!"
4,Ellis Peters worth a second look,"It has been years since I have read one of Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mysteries. I had forgotten what a really good writer she was.I found ""The Devil's Novice"" an entertaining companion for snowy winter days when I'm at home. The plot is excellent--I was indeed as interested in why the priest was murdered as by whom.Peters' blending of historical events into her story and her descriptions of the 12th century English countryside are excellent as well.The love story is rather saccharine however, and more people recover from their injuries than might have been the case in medieval England.Still, this is a novel and a most enjoyable one. Ellis Peters had a great hero in Brother Cadfael and a marvelous command of the English language. Long may her books live."
3,Over my head,"Whereas I'm sure there is no doubting Mr. Auer's ability in playing the violin, as a beginner, I found alot of what he had to say here, irrelevant for my needs. Perhaps I thought that by the word 'teach' in the title, that it would assist, but in fact, it didn't at all. If anything, it made me wonder why I was attempting to start this instrument so late in life!"
2,Overrated,"When Auer is mentioned, you usually hear about him primarily in terms of who his students and teachers were. Heifetz, Galamian and Joachim come to mind. But I didn't find the book very useful. First off, it's a little skinny. Then the style is heavy turn-of-the-century egotist. It's very short on specifics. The only thing he really mentions that kind of turned my head is fingered-octaves. (He's definitely not appealing to beginners, is he?) Most of the rest reads like a pep talk and not the best, at that. If you want a quality read from the past get the Baillot book instead, where the discussions on bowing are much better, and replete with details and examples."
4,Great book from an Amazing Teacher,"Auer was a very famous teacher in his day. He produced some of the most famous violinists of his time. Between this book, and his ""graded course in violin playing"", a student or teacher can get an insight into why his teaching was so successful. If you want practical exercises then look at his graded course. But for a general overveiw of the principles of teaching, and an awareness of which areas need to be focussed on, this book is great."
4,A nice Book.,"The Arnett Collection, which is presented in this book represents a very good overview of the artistic work of the Yoruba in Nigeria dar. Very fine specimens of the usually courtly art of the Yoruba are listed."
3,Okay product,This shave gel worked similarly to a lot of other shave gels on the market. It served its purposes well but it clogged my razor a lot so I will not be repurchasing this item. It didn't moisturize my legs dramatically and I can always use lotion after a shower anyway so the clogged razor was too much of a hassle.
2,"Too much ""noise"" first three tracks","When I first started listening to this cd I said to myself ""a bunch of noise."" When my wife came upstairs to where I was listening she spontaneously asked ""what is all that noise""? It wasn't until the fourth track that I even recognized the Americana in this piece. I do not fault Sharon Isbin; indeed she is a fine guitarist. But music should not be mere noise, which I think much of this cd is."
3,eh,for the muny i guess u get what u pay for it is a nice unti... nicely blue lights that match my pioneer head unit.. it makes a hissing noise (not alternator noise) when the gain is turned up about halfway.or more. but it does give added clarity to the system... another complaint and one that i experience more often than not.. is at night you cant tell where the gain levels are even though the EQ lights up the knobs itself doesnt and you dont know where the knobs are set at..
1,not a good buy 2 days of used and it burn out,this item is not a good eq to buy you it burn out after two days off used and now i can return it
4,Great thoughts; terrible editing,"Martin Luther never ceases to amaze and inspire me with his brilliance and insights. This edition is so poorly edited, however, that there are mispellings throughout and some sentences have not been corrected for grammar. Since this work is in the public domain, you would think that the publishing house would have spent the minimal expense to edit it. It makes great reading but no thanks to the publisher."
1,Censored,"I was very disappointed to learn that this version was CENSORED. They've omitted some original material. That was why I wanted the ""Table Talk"". It's supposed to be the REAL Martin Luther. Very disappointing!!!!"
4,An interesting read,This book is perhaps the most candid look we have into the life and thoughts of Luther. It has its spiritually inspiring moments but for the most part is just good solid Luther logic.
3,Piece of History,"If you can get past the fact that the Protestants are just as delusional as the Catholics, it is interesting reading and a nice slice of history. But you have to be a history buff to enjoy this type of work."
3,"Not top-notch Miike, but still good","Full Metal Yakuza is Miike lite. As is often the case with his films, it's entertaining and outrageous and tastelessly funny, but it lacks the depth and feeling of, say, the first two Dead or Alive films or Ichi the Killer. FMY was made on a low budget as a V-cinema title (Japan's direct-to-video market), and lacks the polish of some of Miike's other work, but I think most Miike fans would enjoy it."
3,not what i was expecting,"having recently become a takashi miike fan i thought id give this one a spin, and while it wasn't a total disappointment, it did leave something to be desired. i was expecting something that would stimulate me on both a visceral level and an intellectual level as well. sadly it did neither. it had neither the amount of gore or the level of wit and symbolism ive come to expect from miike. all in all worth a rent, but im glad i didnt blindly buy it."
2,"I wasn't impressed with the Gillette Shaving Cream, ...","I wasn't impressed with the Gillette Shaving Cream, Aloe and Allantoin. It didn't adhere to my skin well at all, and I also greatly disliked the scent. My wife used it for her legs and said that it was acceptable, but I will stick with my Barbasol."
3,"It was very lathery and rich-feeling, but I ...","It was very lathery and rich-feeling, but I didn't feel that it lived up to its moisturizing claims after use. It did provide a smooth shave. The scent was very refreshing and light. However, I feel that there are equal or better products available right now. I wouldn't buy this product, nor recommend it to my friends or family over other products already available for sale."
5,cowboying isn't easy...,"worked 20 years for a large corporate ag operation that also owned a large ranch and dairy. very remote location on the big island of hawaii, 75 miles south of hilo. southernmost town in the u.s.a. . brought back many memories."
4,Classic Dick Van Dyke,"This movie is a great family disney entertainment such as ""Never A Dull Moment"" or ""The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit"". Dick Van Dyke plays a slightly hapless US Nay pilot who has to eject over the South Pacific and gets marooned on an island. Fortunately, there is an old beached Jap sub to supply needed parts and a stranded chimp from the Mercury program to provide comic relief. Military background viewers will enjoy some of the jabs at military life and training. The special effects are a little see through, but better than ""In Search of the Castaways""."
2,"Funny, but do not recommend.","In its entirety, this move is hilarious. The farther into it you go the more prejudice you see. The movie is laced with it. It makestribal people look like dunces and makes fun of their idol worship. It also make the white man look stupid. The theme iswomen's rights all the way and the woman is the only one who is made to look intelligent. Don't watch it."
3,re Lt. Robin Crusoe,Unfortunatly the advertisment for this product did not state it was in ntsc or region 1 format. so I have had Trouble viewing it. but it seems to be of good quality. & a good buy.
5,"Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.",love Disney and Dick Van Dyke movies and it came quickly and did not cost a lot We grew uo with Disney and I have spent many of my adult years collecting them.
4,"Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. DVD",Great comedy!!!The only bad part I found was the way they made all women seem a little stupid. I overall enjoyed this movie.
2,Could have been okay,Except that it was the most racist and sexist version of Robinson crusoe I've ever seen. So made it challenging to watch
2,Ouch. 1.5 is closer,"A friend recommended this. I shared my copy of Thomasina for him and his children, he reciprocated with this for me and my 9 year old grandson. He got the better deal.Where to list all the things wrong with this? It is a cheaply made, cheesy, limp, insulting, vaguely racist and stupid film, with so many qualities lacking and so few going for it. And though my grandson pronounced it good, he barely laughed. Dick Van Dyke's bumbling and stumbling got tiring in about 3 minutes. Could this knucklehead have been a Navy pilot? I sure hope not!Obviously lots of folks like this. I didn't. I won't go into more detail, but this had the look and a feel of a quickly tossed together product with virtually no thought, care, or plot-consistency put into it. I would pay to not watch this again!"
1,Cant rate this movie.,I tried to watch this movie for 2 days and it kept locking up or would stop all together. I have never seen this movie (and still haven't). My family and I like Dick Van Dyke wish we could of seen it.No review at this time.
4,Very good,"The Gevalia Espresso is excellent. Good taste and consistency even for the most critical coffee drinker. The only reason I don't rate it a 5 is because if you purchase the Gevalia Cappuccino, you get the same espresso pods plus the creamer (also happens with the Latte). I believe this is a better bargain, since they are almost the same price."
5,gives me such a warm feeling about friends. this is my 4th copies to give away to my friends.,"It just make me feel good about people, about friends in different ways in different places.Importance of close human relationship."
2,There is a problem,"The problem is: If you are not familiar with 20th Century Irish history, you will be lost reading this book when Part 1 ends. Doyle provides the reader with no historical background and writes the book assuming that the reader is all ready well-versed in Irish history. I also had trouble visualizing Ireland, the places, buildings, streets, and the battle scenes, which I attribute to Doyle's lack of description and to my lack of Irish knowledge."
1,Mealltach Cac,"I am a huge fan of Roddy Dolye's previous work, but this book is extremely disappointing. There is potential here, but the characters are underdeveloped and trite. The story seems to have been done a billion times before. Why is Roddy going down this well beaten path? He should leave this topic to Frank McCourt and the Clancy Brothers. If you have had the misfortune of purchasing this book do not pass it to a friend unless they have a 3 legged couch.A star for ""A Star Called Henry"". Let's all pray this is not a trilogy."
2,I can wait for Vol 2 and 3,What a waste. Mr Doyle started off magically with his book only to succumbs to a tedious cut and paste history job. This book could have been great if it wasn't so bogged down in history most intelligent adults know about. Why didn't he talk about the characters life outside of history? That would have been to unglamorous and unreadable or maybe to honest and harder for a writer to write. Skip it!
1,I loved Roddy Doyle,"Until I read this book. Here we have Rambo and Romeo all wrapped up in the person of a totally unbelievable fourteen year old boy. Can this be the same guy who so beautifully captured Paddy Clark? If this is indeed a triology, wake me when it's over. Roddy, drag the Van from the surf. Give me Paddy at fifteen or Paula at fifty. Henry is a lot of things, however, smart is not one of them."
4,EXPLOSIVE LANGUAGE,"Doyle sentences are like sticks of dynamite, or maybe they're lit fuses for the explosion of the last line. Either way, the most admirable and memorable thing about this novel for me is his use of language. I've read PADDY CLARK and THE VAN, but I think this is his best novel so far. We've been to this Ireland before in other books, but we haven't been given the tour by Henry Smart, and it's his voice and his life that make the travelled ground seem fresh and dangerous. The last line of the novel is truly a revelation. If you haven't read it, don't look."
3,"Stunning beginning, ho-hum middle and end.","Maybe because I have recently read Morgan Llywelyn's novel,""1916"", I feel like I have already read parts this book (except for the beginning which takes Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"" several shades darker). The first-third of the story is unforgetable as Doyle takes the reader through the dirty alleys and waterways of Henry's lonely, desolate and violent childhood. But then Henry starts fighting for a country he doesn't care about, against a country he doesn't know about, for reasons Doyle won't tell us about. If you are a Doyle fan from his previous works, read the synopsis of the story and then decide if it is the type of reading you are looking for. If you are already familiar with fictional renderings of the Irish rebillion of 1916, you may want to skip this one."
4,A most lovable scoundrel,"In Henry Smart, Roddy Doyle has created a narrator who is both entirely engaging and not the least bit trustworthy. If we are to believe Henry, he was just out of the frame of a famous picture of early IRA members, the uncredited author of a famous poem, the most handsome man in Ireland, the best ""ride"" in town...the list of Henry's ""accomplishments"" is nearly endless.Henry's recounting of his adventures during the early days of the IRA is entrancing-the events themselves are full of large-scale drama, tragedy and courage, while the way in which these tales are told is full of braggadocio and humor. I look forward to Henry's next escapades in this planned trilogy."
3,Uneven...,"This novel presuposes that the reader has some familiarity with the historical events it describes. I'm not sure to what extent a reader without previous knowledge of the Easter Uprising or the development of the IRA could appreciate this book. I was quite happily surprised by the fact that Doyle strips these events of their romanticized veneer, but disappointed by the disipation of the plot and the characters as the piece drew to a conclusion.I will, however, read the next part of the trilogy."
5,A splendidly written and ambitious novel.,"This book has everything anyone could want from a novel. It is funny, adventurous, thought provoking and extremely well written. Henry Smart is a boy who grows up in the Dublin slums amidst poverty and neglect and takes part in the Irish rebellion against England. We view the rebellion and its mythic heroes through his eyes and learn that the uprising, and new Irish nation that it fostered, was not fought for all Irish but for the few Irish who lusted after power, stature, and wealth. I think this is an amazing novel and I can't wait for the next two installments of this trilogy."
1,Poverty,"Poverty, Poverty of mind, poverty of spirit, poverty of morals, poverty of any kind of plan that makes sense, poverty of holding my attention. blech."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Roddy Doyle and was excited that there was to be a trilogy of new work - now I look forward to the trilogy being well and truly over and Doyle, hopefully, regaining his senses. Paddy Clarke and The Woman Who Walked Into Doors were wonderful, compelling, sad and funny novels, but this one left me cold."
3,Ran of of steam,"Rivals McCourts vision of the hell which was Ireland for children in the turn of the century. Gloomy and dull, the story never really rose above the mirk. Henry, fighting for himself rather than the cause, is followed through the turbulent times in Dublin pre and post 1916 rising. Disappointing."
3,Too much fortune in Henry's misfortune,"A Star Called Henry is a fine book. However, this book is far from a five star. Henry has too much fortune in all his misfortune. In attempts to create suspense, Doyle outdoes himself having Henry elude disaster time and time again. I am sure one had to be fortunate to survive the Irish Civil War, but Henry just has a little too much Irish luck for my liking.On a positive note, I very much enjoyed Doyle's use of the intricacies of the IRA."
2,Dissapointing,"Nowhere near as good as I had hoped, wouldn't recommend, a bit too long and parts of the story went nowhere, was also hoping for a better ending."
1,A series,Started reading this book not realizing that the author had indeed created a series from this story . . . hence felt that the book took too long in certain chapters and glossed over others . . . with no clear ending. In other words the ending seemed precipitous - just so that a second book could be realized.
5,A StarCalled Henry,"I loved this book! As a Dubliner currently living in the USA, I often find myself in search of a well written book about my homeland. Roddy Doyle usually provides a way for me to feel at home. Although the poverty and violence in the book could not have been further from my own life in Dublin, the characters were all people I knew. Like any well written book, I became emotionally attached to the main character, Henry, and could not put the book down. It was an interesting blend of history and fiction. Roddy took the reader through a wide range of emotions connected to the problems in Ireland and the problems faced by the poor in every city."
4,Looking forward to the next installment,"This book took a while to get into, but once I did I could not stop reading. I enjoyed the beginning and middle more than the rather over-the-top ending, but overall the book is still highly recommended. It also inspired me to pick up some of Roddy Doyle's older novels (The Barrytown Trilogy, The Woman Who Walked Into Doors) which are amazing as well. Discover this wonderful Irish author for yourself!"
3,Magical realism meets Frank McCourt,"I have not read any of Roddy Doyle's other books, so I don't know if he always employs the technique of ""magical realism"" in his work; I just know I am not a fan of this particular style. The opening chapters of ""A Star Called Henry"" are much more engaging than what follows; as Henry grows up I found him a rather boring macho braggart. There are better fictional accounts of the Uprising of 1916 & as far as accounts of growing up poor in Ireland, well, ""Angela's Ashes"" is as good as writing can possibly get. All in all, if readers were not slavering for anything resembling a McCourt book, this novel would probably have sunk without a trace."
2,Had greater expectations,"I didn't feel let down, but had greater expectations. Piecing together previews is obviously an art. We don't recall hearing about this movie when it was in theaters and were tempted by the video preview. The movie was good enough we didn't feel we wasted our time watching it, but don't feel it's anything we would watch again. And our copy didn't include sub-titles either - some dialog was hard to follow."
2,very bad production,"after you pop-in the dvd you are forced to watch (blocked FF and skip) an ad for another movie. The ad is very long, very bad and the quality is horrible.The sound in the movie itself is poor and it is very hard to understand the dialogs. No subtitles. the movie is cheaply made. perhaps some people can find this movie funny, we did not.we lasted about 15 minutes before the movie went back into the red envelope..."
1,Never got to the War,"I wish I COULD rate this movie, but it just won't play in any of my 3 DVD players. I asked for a replacement from Amazon, which they did graciously and speedily, but even the replacement fails to load and play in my player which plays other DVDs just fine. Moreover, Two Men Went To War locks up the controls of the DVD player. Obviously it isn't made to the standards of the hundreds of other DVDs I've bought from Amazon.I have just discovered that the DVD DOES load and play in my Mac Powerbook G4. That's nice, but I had planned to see the film it in my home theater on the big screen. Bummer!"
5,I Learnt All the Greek Mythology from the Book!,"I was a typical Japanese until I chanced to find this book(the Japanese Edition) when I was around 15 or so, since then, every time I encountered unfamiliar names from the myth, the very first thing I've done is to refer this book. The book is, too, out of print here in Japan which, I think, is a big loss for Japanese people to expand their knowledge in an interesting way.I'm 44 now, about 30 years have gone by since I read this book for the first time, and yet, still I have the book as a treasure of my life.Anyway, I am going to get this English edition, too, so that I can study English with much more motivation.(My English is just limited, be patient with it please)"
3,Efficacy,I am not sure how helpful was this medication. I plan to stop taking this for a while to evaluate my situation. I started to take this because one of my friend has been taking this for long time. --- Dr. Datta
5,extremely relaxing,"i dont have a long review to write cus the others have put it beautifuly already,i agree with others that ricks deep voice never got the credit it fully deserved..this album is really relaxing to listen to at home or whenever...i love the song ""it would take a strong man""he really uses his voice in that one..whenever you need somebody is a fave of mine also as well as never going to give you up!!i would recommend anyone to have this one added to your library if you dont already have it"
5,"Rick Astley's ""whenever you need somebody cd"": good looks and great sound all on one heart-throb of a cd",i love every song on this album! i could listen to rick astley and his music all day and never tire of it. great british sound.i travelled back to when this album's hit songs first came out in the 80s and it was perfection all over again. this is a great buy. fantastic sing-along music. enjoy!
4,Blast from my Past!,"I had this album on tape back in the late 80's and wore it out. I forgot about it until I started hearing Rick on contemporary radio. Then I was like, hey! I want it back! I got it at a great price and it definitely completes my 80's CD collection."
2,One great single and a whole bunch of filler.,"""Never Gonna Give You Up"" is one of the best light-pop dance singles of the 1980s. ""Together Forever"" musically is OK, but the lyrics are incredibly trite, even by the admittedly low standards for this type of music. The rest of this album is not even worth mentioning. Astley has an above-average voice, but he can't salvage the weak material he's saddled with here. Get the singles off of Napster or tape them off the radio and ignore the rest of this."
1,ugh,This trash is a reminder to us all that enough hype and exposure can turn anything into a hit. This shaggy-haired British Val Kilmer type is an abomonation. I can sleep at night knowing he's probably pumping gas somewhere in Bristol.
3,Astley's voice is better than his material,"I remember when I saw my first Astley video, I was blown away that such a soulful baritone could come from a red-headed lad from the British Isles. This, his first album, was on my must-have list.Almost two decades later, fond memories flood the mind as I listen to the selections that were to be his hits: the title cut, ""Never Gonna Give You Up"", ""Together Forever"", and ""Don't Say Goodbye"". However, in hindsight, I think the singer was superior to the standard dance pop with which he was saddled.He does rise to the occasion with a surprisingly good remake of the Nat King Cole classic ""When I Fall in Love"". This cut rounds out the album and suggests that Astley should have considered more songs of this caliber that may have lengthened his ""shelf life""."
5,I really like this product and will buy ...,"I really like this product and will buy it in the future. I like how it made my skin so soft after I shaved and dried off. My skin was silky smooth, unlike it is after I use other products that tend to dry out my skin."
5,It starts out as a gel and quickly ...,"It starts out as a gel and quickly turns into thick, rich foam. I didn't need to use a moisturizer on my legs after using this, which is very unusual for me after shaving. I would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry, flaky """"winter"""" legs!"
4,I was pretty impressed with this product. It ...,"I was pretty impressed with this product. It smelled great, and left my skin soft and smooth. I'll definitely buy this again."
1,I didn't like this product very much. I'm ...,"I didn't like this product very much. I'm not sure if it was the shaving gel or not, but when I used this product, I nicked myself several times. I wouldn't recommend this product to my friends or family. It did however, leave my skin feeling very smooth."
2,I've never used any kind of shaving cream ...,"I've never used any kind of shaving cream before. This product is very foamy. A little goes a very long way. After shaving, my legs definitely felt softer than when I shaved using soap. I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to friends."
4,we got this after she would not put it down at a friends house,We got this for my daughters 2nd birthday after she would not put it down at a freinds house. Both my 2 year old and 4 1/2 year old really do like it. It is easy to control and fun. Dad really like playing with it too. It does however use a lot of batteries.
3,"Fun toy, doesn't work all the time","We bought this toy for our 20 month old son for Christmas this year. He seems to like it well enough. He'll use the remote control and push the buttons. He's just in this fickle spot right now where he bores easily with one toy and moves on to the next. But he does play with it and can operate it, so we were happy to see that.As far as the over-all product, we've had problems with ours since we opened it. It doesn't always go when you push the buttons. Sometimes you have to turn if off and back on a few times and even then you have to push the remote buttons a few more times before it will start. We've tried changing batteries and resetting the thing, but it still happens.Over-all, a fun toy. My husband and I even enjoy driving it around and chasing the cat and dog with it, but I just wish it worked all the time. I still think it would be a good buy for any child."
3,BEWARE OF GETTING CAUGHT IN HAIR,MY 5 MONTH OLD LOVES THIS TOY IT DIFFENTLY ENCOURAGED HIM TO CRAWL! HE LOVED HOW IT GIGGLED AND WE ENJOYED WATCHING HIM CHASE IT. HOWEVER MY 6 YEAR OLD WAS USING IT ONE DAY AND IT RAN OVER MY HAIR AS I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR AND GOT TERRIBLY TANGLED I HAD TO CUT A HUGE CHUNK OF MY HAIR OUT AND EVEN THEN I COULD NOT GET THE HAIR OUT OF THE TOY I HAD TO THROW IT OUT.
3,Not what I expected,This toy look like fun on TV but when you get it home it's a different story. We are on our second one. The first one broke after 2 weeks. Does not work well on any carpet. Regular floors seems OK if it doesn't hit the cabinets and get stuck. Not very good navigation.It does get my son's attentipn for a bit. I think he just likes the cute sounds it makes.
2,Commercial is Misleading,"When I purchased this toy I was very disappointed. I felt the commercial was very misleading as it showed the toy running and giggling on its own. Definitley not as cute as I thought it would be. My 2 year old daughter plays with it sometimes, but she loses interest when it gets stuck on things and ceases to do what she wants it to. I wish I had taken it back."
3,Not what I expected!,"I, like some of the other reviewers, saw this toy advertised on tv and thought it ran on its own without someone using the remote control. Obviously, I was wrong! Our 2-year old sons understand the concept of the remote control and know how to use it, but it gets hung up a lot and that frustrates them. And we also need to turn it off and on again to get it to move once it gets hung up. I thought that it would run on its own and continuously giggle, not so. That being said, it really isn't that great of a toy for a small child that cannot run the remote on his own yet."
5,My son loves it!,"My son loves this toy. He is only 6 months old and he would watch this for hours. My husband loves to drive it around and chase the dog with it, and my son is very content to watch. He also loves to chew on the remote and we have never had any difficulty with him drooling all over it. It also works great over any surface."
4,Fun for the whole family!,I got this for my 10 month old foster son and he really enjoys chasing it around the house. My 7 and 10 year old sons love to operate the remote...so do I! In fact my younger son wants one for his birthday. It's really a fun toy!I have a regular wall to wall carpet and it operates just fine!
3,Cute but,"This is a cute toy and I thought my 2.5 year old would LOVE it. Wrong...she was terrified of it. So, my 4 year old started playing with it instead, and he lost interest pretty quickly. We then passed it to the 3.5 year old and she couldn't figure out the controls. I still think it's such a cute toy, I'm just disappointed that none of our 7 children were interested in it, we cover ALL of the age groups! The worst part? It sucks batteries!"
3,Doesn't GO on carpet!,"IF you have mostly carpet in your house, you don't want this toy because it doesn't work on carpet. I was so disappointed. I have wood floors with a rug over it and the wheels on the unit are not big enough to even work on it. I could understand if it was a thick rug, but it is very low.Also, I thought this toy would just move around on the floor by itself and my baby would just chase after it, but instead, it must be controlled by the ring remote and when you press it,it only goes a short distance and stops. I bought this for my baby that is 9 months old, but my 3 year old daughter loves it more. So, that in itself is good at least. Overall, I would say that it is an adorable toy IF you have the room and the right surface, but has some flaws that you SHOULD KNOW ABOUT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"
3,You get what you pay for,"For $... it is about what I expected. It runs great on tile but not so great on carpet. Either I got a bad batch of batteries (3 times) or this thing is eating them! We are having some trouble with it ""hanging up"". We have to turn it off and on a lot to get it to go again.My one-year-old is still not sure if she likes it or is scared of it. I think Mom and Dad are having more fun running it around than she is."
2,Goofy Giggles spazzes out!,"I originally bought this for my daughter to encourage her to crawl and she loved it! But after ten minutes of using it, it suddenly died and it would only giggle when I pushed the buttons. I had used brand new batteries(alkaline as it recommends) but nothing so I turned it off for about an hour and then turned it back on, but this time it did the complete opposite and flipped out! The thing just went crazy and was going so fast and spinning so fast that it flipped over and wouldn't stop until I finally just turned it off. Well I tried it a couple more times and it just did the same thing either wouldn't work or just went so fast it toppled itself over, so I just gave up. Bummer, my daughter really enjoyed it too."
4,A good balanced history with some lessons for today.,"This book paints a complicated portrait of almost a thousand years of relations between Jews and Gentiles in Poland as they played out in a small town or shtetl. Without ignoring the horror of events such as the Holocaust, the author seldom describes this history as black and white; favoring shades of gray and multiple perspectives instead.I appreciated the author's attempts at balance and her non-vindictive tone especially considering her own background. Focussing on how events played out in one particular town, grounds the account in the lives of real people and makes the subject more accessible. This is a good book for general readers but it suffers from overly academic language and a tendency to repeat itself in some places. I also thought the author's thesis about multiculturalism was underdeveloped."
4,A worthy thesis.,"While it is true that the limits of difference were tested in the Polish-Jewish relationship, this book is as much as monument to the perpetrators and bystanders as it is to the victims. In the United States we do not have a situation where differences in culture lead to mass extermination. And though it is also true that the Germans were the instigators, it is no accident that the death camps were in Germany and eastern, not western, Europe. In any case, the dead Jewish children, women and men won't get out of their graves to dance if and when we finally understand this most terrible of all events."
3,grrrrrrr,"To anyone who is reading this, please note.. there are multiple musical endeavors with the name ARIA. For two years I have been looking for a certain song off a cd called ""aria"". i was wrong, yet again. This cd, Ceremony of Souls, was not what i was expecting. On the cover is some pasty white latin guy trying to look hard core with a black leather jacket. I almost sent the cd back without opening it. The cover art is THAT bad. Anyhow, I listened to it, and while it isn't what i had hoped for, it is a decent cd overall. I have been really into this style of music lately, so it fit into my collection quite nicely."
3,WAY TOO MUCH,"This book claims to be for a lower-level college Astronomy course. Currently, I am enrolled in a lower level astronomy course and have just completed the book. IN the early chapters the book is supurb, primarily because it relies heavily on definitions, however, further into the book (where it supplies explinations) it becomes extremely confusing. While explaining something the author will quickly spit out 3 or 4 new words which immediately leaves the reader mind boggled. I found myself reading a whole section just to have no clue what it was really trying to say. I recomend this book if you are an advanced astronomy student, yet if you are a beginer or just taking it to satisfy your science core requirment (which I am) stay lightyears away from this book. It starts off great but then throws WAY TOO MUCH at you."
5,Looks and Performs Great!,"Installed this faucet / sprayer combo in my kitchen a few years back. Still works great! Guests love it. I usually have to show them how to turn it on...which is fun! Very sturdy construction and chrome is SO shiny. Hand sprayer is heavier, but completes the overall look of this show piece. No regrets."
2,Limited compatibility,"This is a great little idea, but maybe not a great little device. It isn't compatible with NTFS USB devices (i.e. most modern USB external hard disks), and apparently can't read some common USB accessories (for instance, my COWON mp3 player and some cameras). It can read smaller/cheaper mp3 players and some USB cameras - but both source and target devices must be FAT32/vfat formatted, which makes those devices somewhat less useful with your computer. The documentation and packaging fails to mention this important limitation.Another thing the packaging doesn't tell you is that this is a USB 1.1 device, thus the transfer rate is too slow for anything but small devices unless you have access to AC power and plenty of time.With USB-2.0 and better compatibility (NTFS, and maybe some config software so you could choose the source and target directory/folder structure) this would be a great device at twice the price. In it's current state it's already obsolete."
2,"Very, very, very slow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",It took 2 hours to copy a 1gb of pictures from a 2-gb SD card connected to a USB reader to another 4-gb USB drive.
1,NOT for MP3 Players!,"Belkin Components USB Portable Bridge HubThe description on this item is wrong!! I called Belkin support to make sure this would work moving pictures from a digital camera to a Zune. They e-mailed that it would work. It didn't. I sent the Zune back. Belkin said it would work with an Ipod Classic. It didn't. I sent the Ipod back. After talking to support supervisors, and their supervisors, I called the company directly (in Compton, CA) The techie told me (in much better English) this ONLY works with portable hard drives, NOT with MP3 players."
2,Over-The-Top Big Ben,"I knew these where going to be big and maybe a little bug eye but this is ridiculous. I'm 6'7 so I have a very big head, most hats won't fit me. These glasses are big on me and make me look like a fly. Way too big, laughable. They will fit over my glasses but they smash my small frame glasses against my head. I'm glad I only spent 10 dollars on these because they look too stupid to use. yes they are comfy to wear but that's it. I can't say it enough so I'll say it again, way too big!!"
1,By far their worst effort yet. Babylon is near.,"One of reggaes best new generation bands has taken a step back. After progressing with each of their first three albums I really expected some true and wonderful roots and culture, instead I got Free Up. A total decline from thier preceeding album Resistance (4 stars) and their rather simplistic, but good vibe of their first album Wake up (4 stars). I do believe the presure of the record company to hit it big into the main stream may have been their downfall. Too many remakes, too overly produced, not enough band. Come back to your roots."
2,Big Let Down,"After their first two cd's being such big hits, FREE UP is a big let down. Their rhythm is just not the same and their sincerity in their songs seems to have dimished somehow. I do hope that they come out with some new and better songs soon seeing as they are one of the best reggae bands today!"
3,mediocre rehashing,"Most of this book rehashes midrashic legends- and does so without enough detail for the reader to fully understand the context of those legends. Maybe if I was less knowledgeable I would find this book more interesting.Having said that, the book does occasionally come to life when Wiesel brings in his own perspectives. For example, he asks why Joseph is so often described as a ""tzaddik"" and points out that Joseph's uniqueness lay in his ability to get past the suffering he experienced at the hands of others, despite the absence of the kind of Divine revelation that his ancestors benefitted from."
4,Cute cover but,The cover of this book caught my eye but if you are looking for illustrations I was a bit disappointed. There are lots of stories and history of various artists though.
4,A good gift for a Lithuanian bride in the U.S.,I purchased this book as a wedding gift for a Lithuanian bride who has been in the U.S. for 13 years. She always talks about beet and potato soups. She was so pleased and surprised by it. She thinks there are a lot of recepies that go back to her childhood.
3,Someone please get this writer a copy editor,Great story. Would have really liked to give it a five star. I love all Leigh Greenwood story lines but the sloppy spelling errors and lack of editing in alot of these books has just about spoiled it for me. For this writer to ever be published she would have to take more pride in her work. Its a shame to see such great stories destroyed when the is spelled me and etc... Hope someone lets her know.
2,Photocopy of a Textbook,"I ordered this book for a graduate class and chose to use Amazon in order to save some money. The book would have been $160 through my school's book service and was offered for $116 on Amazon. Unfortunately, the product - while it is the correct textbook - is a print-on-demand version from the publisher. Print-on-demand is really just a glorified photocopy with a cover and I hardly think it was worth the $116 I paid for it as the quality of the copy is terrible. I can read the text, but charts, graphs, and images that were originally in color are now sad, fuzzy, gray blobs. Pearson/Allyn & Bacon should have made it clear that this was not an original textbook when they offered the book to Amazon - it was nowhere in the description. This is not Amazon's fault - it is the fault of the publisher offering less-than-quality merchandise."
4,Decent read for a textbook,Popham does a good job making this book a decent read. Meaning -- it is not dry like so many textbooks. He uses some humor to take you through the book while still clearly presenting information.
1,NOT A TRUE NEW BOOK!,I am very disappointed in the quality of this book.It appears it has been photocopied and bound.To market this as a new book is fraudulent.I would not recommend spending the outrageous price for this book try to find a hard bound copy.
4,Junkies unite!,Great story about junkies/go-no-wheres uniting to create a sanctuary of sanity through baseball. Great snapshots of meandering lives and decisions gone awry. Some name dropping from the punk/metal/rock scene that could make it worth any Jane's Addiction fan's time worth while. Couldn't stop reading. Ripped right through it.
5,"Junkies, wino's, pimps and whores.... and baseball","I've never done hard jail time, and I've also never slept with a stripper, but this book opened a window into a life many of us have chosen to either forget or never look through. It really forces one to think about the realization of dreams and ambitions in ones life versus the things that we do to get there and the lessons we are willing to forget in order to keep those dying dreams alive... there are simple joys in life, like baseball, good sex, and good friends, this book shows that despite our failures as human beings, we are still capable of redemption to some degree and some realization of happiness."
3,"good, not great","Some flaws here, the most significant being that Mundy is mostly someone to whom things happen, rather than a person who makes things happen himself. Secondly, he's an awful lot like The Honourable Schoolboy's Jerry Westerby as a character type: a tall, affable Englishman who is lonely and overall a bit of a sad sack. Also, there are nearly 300 pages of backstory leading up to the present-tense action that, when all is said and done, is poorly built up and awkwardly concluded. And yet I kept turning the pages. I guess even a relative disappointment from le Carre is still a pretty good book."
3,Classic le Carre,"Le Carre is a great writer, but he has his blind spots, especially if Americans are involved.OK, that said. Le Carre has created a memorable character in Ted Mundy.His evolution from being failed and adrift to a player in cold war espionage is a classic. A great cynic and observer of human nature, le Carre has no equal when writing about cold war espionage. Hugely entertaining."
1,Disappointing,"John le Carre demonstrates his command of the English language as well as his ability to develop characters. These aspects of the book are truly enjoyable.Unfortunately the plot is a rant against America and is simply not believable. If you enjoy this sort of thing and want to indulge in a left-wing, paranoid-delusional fantasy, then this book is for you. The rest of us should give it a pass.Given how much I have enjoyed his past works, this one is truly disappointing. I used to think that le Carre was a master of subtle and believable plots. No more."
1,Boring; overwrought,"As a long-time fan of le Carre, I found this and The Constant Gardener to be great disappointments. Interesting character development but plot and pace are nil. Le Carre sounds like a broken record of Michael Moore. If I want to read editorials, I can go to the New York Times. This will be my last le Carre."
1,Don't waste your money,"300 pages of character development (of a character not worth developing), followed by 100 pages of sophmoric plot. I regret having wasted many hours of my life reading this book. Lamest ending I've read in a long time and definitely not worthy of le Carre."
3,Start at Page 296,"The pressure is on these days--at least from literary agents--to write longer and longer works of fiction. No doubt, the highly focused blast at Bush/Blair neoconservative imperialism that reigns from pages 296 through the end of the text formed the core of LeCarre's original submission. Then his agent said, ""you've got to pad it out old boy, your public expects it."" If so, t'is a public that raved about The Honorable Schoolboy and not the one that worshipped A Small Town in Germany.Belongs in the same company with, though not quite up to the level of Brazil and LeCarre's The Night Manager."
1,Absolute Trash,"Beyond any doubt, this is the worst John le Carre novel published. What begins as an interesting story of two reluctant spies suddenly deteriorates into a sadly naive and blatantly sophomoric anti-American screed ending in an outlandish climax derived from the depths of some personal hatred rather than the genius of a fertile imagination. It is sad to see how low this once great writer of fiction has fallen"
2,Big Disappointment,"I've liked most of Le Carre's books, the spy novels as well as the others. Absolute Friends is an interesting and mostly enjoyable read for much of the book, but the author permits his almost extreme anti-American views to take over the last 50 or 60 pages of this novel, creating a wholly unacceptable and bizarre ending. I've long considered Le Carre to be an excellent story teller with a great imagination. These talents are wasted here, just as your time will have been if you pick up this book."
2,A slog,"I've read some wonderful books by the author, but this one seems overwritten-- at least the first half repetitive and tedious-- endless pages of left wing rant. Read the others-- they're better.Forsyte."
4,"Despite the ending, a good read.",This is vintage Le Carre with fabulous characters and worth the read just for that. A post Cold War story with as much espionage skulduggery as in the worst of times.Kingmaker
1,A Numbing Tirade,"Le Carre's Absolute Friends may be ""stunningly timely"" according to Entertainment Weekly but it is also a 466-page paperback yawn. In fewer than twenty pages the reader can predict the outcome but it takes a good three hundred pages to begin to get interesting. That fades quickly with le Carre's ham-fisted slamming of the West for everything wrong with the world, a numbing tirade that seems to be the only purpose for the novel. It certainly isn't to tell a story. Le Carre fails to use even the slightest subtlety in either character development or plot. What happened to the master story teller? He certainly abandoned his craft to write Absolute Friends.My copy went in the recycle bin. Don't waste your money. You'll get better value out of spending it on toilet paper."
1,Where Has LeCarre Gone?,"Mr. Cornwall is just another radical who must send his message of how bad we Americans have become. I have read all of his books and they were beyond reproach. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a classic, as are others. But he has gone off the deep end, much like a Hollywood lackey... I will never, let me repeat, never buy one of his books again."
2,A Whole Lot of Nothing,"LeCarre, the man who continues to hang his hat on Agent Smiley....Very unnecessarily difficult read. What is this author trying to do, reincarnate Shakespeare? Why are there no headings at the beginning of each chapter to give me some idea of a dateline? Instead I'm forced to use hidden clues such as the age of Mundy's wasted son to determine how much time has passed. Lecarre has to give it up. Amongst modern history, the Berlin wall is a speck of dust. He'd be better off writing about Panama or Grenada. Writing about the Berlin Wall segment of the Cold War in the 21st century is like beating a dead horse. The characters are ridiculous. If this guy Mundy is so smart, why does he worship Sasha? Why? Did they just smoke so much dope together in their days of protest that their brains were that fried? These two are modern day hippies! Losers! Driftwood!"
1,What's Going On?????,"I'm just over 100 pages into this book and I've yet to determine just what is going on. Too many unannounced flashbacks make one wonder are we in the present, past or future. And, sometimes, I wonder what country we are in.I am becoming bogged down with the language. This is not a pleasant book to read. I may never finish this book - it is too plodding and uninteresting."
4,An Unusual Spy Novel,"This effort by le Carre is as much literature as it is spy thriller. While dry and slow to get going, you will be rewarded if you stick with it. This is first-rate character development, better than anything else he has done so far. Well worth the price in paperback."
3,Not his best work.,"I've read every one of le Carre's books and this is his weakest effort. A good story, I kept turning the pages but the story left me with the impression that it was a political statement with a plot wrapped around it. I couldn't agree more with the political statement, but it would have been better as a non-fiction book reading directly about le Carre's opinions."
2,Story lacks excitment of other Le Carre books,I loved le Carre's spy novels and was expecting more of the same but this book has been a disappointment. It is very slow moving and hard to get any sympathy for the characters. It's taken me a week to get to chapter 5 (I usually read a book in a few days) and I'm not sure I'll make it to the end on this one unless it gets better soon.
4,A Superbly Crafted Story,"Covering events spanning seven decades from the partition of India to today's war in Iraq, this novel tracks a pair of left thinking, anti-establishment men who, despite very different personalities, become and remain through the years ""absolute friends."" Le Carre examines the development of their poltical and social values, and he chronicles their on and off exploits as they move from 1960's Berlin revolutionaries to cold war spies and beyond.The story is excellent, though it is guaranteed to offend some readers--particularly many American conservatives. Better than the storyline though, is le Carre's superb writing style and his complete command of the English language. His literary craftsmanship is truly remarkable."
2,"starts out ok, bottoms out into a total mess...","i picked this up because of the reviews that said how great it was on the book. oops my bad. it started out well, and was interesting and enjoyable for the first 4/5ths of the book or so while lecarre was out tromping through his heyday era in cold war europe. but when it fastforwards back to the 2003 world the book really just falls apart. i'm a huge lecarre fan (anxiously awaiting the movie the constant gardener) but this one was one of the worst lecarre offerings."
3,More of the same. Ho hum.,"If you've read, say, ""The Honourable Schoolboy,"" then the atmosphere will be entirely familiar. Other than that, the Russians have been superceded by Arabs and multinationals. Nothing else has changed.I really don't know why I bother buying his books any more. I think I'd probably get just as much from re-reading ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold."""
3,Pages Mission,"Although this book has been helpful, several of the worksheet exercises were torn out of the back of the book."
3,Very simple design that works well.,I bought this bracket to install a XM antenna on my aluminum boat. It turned out to be a cheap alternative to buying an expensive marine antenna and utilizing a spare vehicle antenna.
1,Dog Star Radios will never get my business again!,"I never received my antenna mount. I paid for Priority Mail shipping, I was notified that is was due to be shipped out and that it should arrive Feb 6th. I never received it. After three weeks of calls and much arguing, I finally got them to do a refund with the promise that should the mount ever show up, I would return it to them. It still has never made it here. Personally, I believe that they screwed up and never shipped it out. I do NOT recommend Dog Star Radios."
5,flex shampoo,Don't know why but this item cannot be purchased in any stores in my community. I think it's great and I've been using it for years.
2,"REVLON FLEX SHAMPOO, EXTRA BODY, 15 OUNCES - 1 BOTTLE",THIS WAS PURCHASED IN ERROR. IT WAS VERY DEFINITELY OVERPRICED. THIS PRODUCT DID NOT HAVE A SCENT AND THE PRODUCT WAS ALMOST MAROON IN COLOR. NOT THE PALE YELLOW COLOR OF THE SHAMPOO I PURCHASED IN THE PAST. THE PRODUCT WAS OLD. . THE ITEM WAS RETURNED TO THE SELLER FOR CREDIT. .
2,a little overdone,"At this point I am reading the rest of the Gor novels simply to be able to say that I finished the series. Don't get me wrong, the eroticism of submission has been well (and HEAVILY) illustrated, but if I see one more woman tricked into slavery, saying she was a slave all along masquerading as a free woman, another comment on how ALL women are slaves and not truely happy unless at the feet of a man, I would happily throw these books all out. Norman is certainly entitled to his philosophy, and I have much respect for the women who chose to model a lifestyle after him (with submissive tendencies myself), but isn't there a point where you are just beating the proverbial dead horse to an even bloodier pulp?Also, please tell me how many people have actually read the portions of the story where he describes a game of Kaissa or the measurements of the war ships. I've been able to skip several sections of these books without losing out on any of the story."
2,Not my type of fiction.,"This novel is seriously anti-woman. Every woman portrayed is either a slave or hateful. The author writes long tirades, supposedly the thoughts of the main character, about the superiority of Gorean men, and the natural inferiority of Gorean women. It is adult fiction. It would probably be good as a marital aid, as the sex scenes are long and sweaty."
5,One of the very best,"This Karajan recording of the Sibelius tone poems is stellar, and one of the essential recordings in the classical music genre. For those unacquainted with Sebelius, the music is highly listenable, with beautiful orchestral textures, and engaging melodies.In typical DGG style, the mics are close to the orchestra. This results in a brilliance of sound, especially with the horns (which are used extensively in Finlandia). The result is nothing short of spectacular. Contrast this recording style with Mercury Living Presence, where the mics are hung further back, in front of the orchestra, creating an image of how the orchestra would sound to the audience. Each of these recording styles has proponents. I like them both -- they're different, and both enjoyable."
3,Technical but not theological,"This book requires a good grasp of Koinia Greek to follow some of the evidence presented. Fox bases all his work in this book around the premise that the three most common versions of Esther are the work of redactors rather than having been inspired. I purchased this book because of its inclusion of the Alpha Text version of Esther. Fox includes the Greek text, but doesn't translate it, so I had to purchase David J.A. Clines' book ""The Esther Scroll""."
5,I find myself enjoying this over and over,"I purchased the audio version of this book to listen to during my commute, and a year after the original purchase I realized that I've played this tape more than any other.Why?Aristotle's ideas can be like knives cutting through cluttered thinking, but his presentation can be a bit long and dry. Morris does a nice job of presenting Aristotle's virtues of Truth, Goodness, Unity, and Beauty as they can be applied to business while putting a fun and popular face on them.You can find good arguments in many books for being honest in business as well as doing good and creating a sense of unity. Beauty was a surprise, but Morris argues well for it. I felt that the combination of ancient wisdom with modern examples made Morris' message meaningful and more inspirational than many other business books.I've gotten a lot of mileage out of these ideas, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking to find Aristotle's virtues in the workplace."
3,even anime gods have their bad days,"Despite the hype, Spriggan is second rate, at best. Fantastic character design and animation, mind you, but ultimately the zero plot and lack of character developement drags it down. I saw it in NYC,and my expectations were no where near met. The music was good and the overall design of the film was fantastic, but pleeeeeeze hire a decent writer. Go buy Jin Roh, or Vampire Hunter D, but when this video comes out rent before purchase."
3,Spriggan,"This movie is not bad, it has great animation and plenty of action, but if you are looking for drama and awesome story then you probably won't like it. Because this movie mostly concentrate in action that's it, but awesome anyway."
5,a great film for all anime fans,This is a great film that i just watched their is everything here for someone who enjoys action films. this movie combines the mummy and james bond and a little bit of iron man ( the reason why i say iron man is because the main person in the film uses a battle suit it is not like iron mans but it does make him stronger and faster and has gadgets and he does fight cyborg men) I do not want to give away to much but this film is not to be missed.
4,Pretty good anime title.,"This movie can best be summarized as Akira meets Universal Soldier meets Raiders of the Lost Ark. The basic plot is that one group has located Noah's Ark. Another group wants it. Both groups have elite soldiers who fight it out for possession of the Ark. The animation is this movie is pretty high quality, and the added in computer graphic effects are very well done. Bottom line: Good movie for anime fans."
4,ONE OF THE BETTER ANIMES,"I cannot believe that this movie is not on everyone's top ten list for ""listmania"". This is a cool action-adventure, with neat gun battles and few boring moments, and with keen artwork so realistic that at times you almost forget it's a cartoon. It is best to have watched other anime first before seeing Spriggan, then you will realize just how much fun this one is compared to all the rest. Those who haven't seen Spriggan don't know what they are missing!"
4,A very fun action filled movie,"I don't know what people mean when they say this movie reminds them of a James Bond film. In my eyes it by no means resembles one. Its kind of like a weird Indiana Jones Terminator mystical ghost in the shell kind of thing (not really - -). Its a fun movie and I suggest you watch it. Its basically about Noah's arc being found and it turning out to be a thing that can change the worlds climate and stuff. There are some good fight scenes but there are definetely better animes out there. I like this film better then Ghost in the shell because it actually keeps you involved the whole movie, and you don't ever want to stop it or fast forward.Try this one"
3,not really a good movie but its a refershing change of pace,"Spriggan formats itself as more a less an anime film as much as just a plain action film. Luckily the charcheter desisns are not of the anime cliche and (gasp!) theres almost a sense of style in a ""Akira"" like way. And unlike most anime its not purposely over complicated. The action and animation is also crisp and fluid and doesnt rely on dramatic still shots and closeups. Outside of that given though its mainly a rote action flick at that. The plot has a sort of interesting tinge to it but the whole seems unfinished and the whole thing seems like an Indiana Jones pic (atient relic with power discovered, good guys want to keep it out of bad guys hands). But the pace isnt sluggish so things are brisk and not talk heavy. not the msot memorable of animated pics but certainly noteworthy for its elements."
1,i felt like shooting myself after watching this movie!!!!,spriggan is quite possibly the worst display of what japenese animation can be. its animation and fight secnes were really good but that was all.....the story was lacking (if not non- existant). i mean ist supposed to be about noahs arc.......so how do they fit dinosaurs in there? (im not kidding there were actually dinosaurs......dont ask me how) if ou really want a good action anime that has at least some semblance of a story line get akira or outlaw star. if youre new to anime steer clear of this one lest it tarnish your opinion of the genra forever..........but seriously get akira.......it rox!
3,I can't stop laughing,"I can't stop laughing every time I read the title of this movie, why?, the ending of course. This movie rips off a lot of other original anime (*chough*Akira*chough*[I mean come on... a kid with crazy insane powers, he even looks like akira...sort of...]), and although the plot is pretty interesting and is fairly well developed, it never really explains who all the people they introduce are. Not only that, but the movie leaves you with a 'What the heck kind of ending was that?!' feeling, it's as though they were running out of money, and insteady of doing a ton of still scenes with a ton of talking, they decide to wrap the ending up without really letting you know what happens, it's like they end it with '...and some stuff happens, the end.' I'm not sure if it's worth buying, but it's at least worth seeing once."
2,Muddy Animation & Slow Plot,"I had heard great things about this movie and was sure that it would be good so I bought it. Although I liked the idea of the movie, I did not care for the look of this film. The animation was dark and muddy. Also, the characters lacked development and the plot moved at a very slow pace. I hit the skip forward button on my DVD player hoping that things would get better, but it never did. Maybe hard core animation fans would like it, but for a casual fan like me that watches Robotech and the Transformers, this was not the movie for me."
2,Dragonball Jonez and the Moonraker Temple of Doom,"The packaging touts this movie as a blend of Indiana Jones and James Bond, but there's a little too much Dragonball Z in the mix for my liking. All the tired old anime cliches and tropes are trotted out- cyborgs, super-agent schoolboy with myterious past and numbered tattoo, doomsday devices, floating fortresses, genius child villain psychic; and are thrown together with a bunch of tired old live action movie cliches- chases through alley way markets, mysterious ancient ruins, jungle fights, benign mad professor with gadgets and beautiful bespectacled assistant, loose cannon agent and older more earthed offsider. The sum is magically somewhat less than the parts. The animation and action sequences are superlative, but for me it's a case of all style and little substance, or attempt at innovation."
3,Action Packed but....,"Spriggan was a very well animated, action-packed film. It has a semi-creative plot with noah's ark as being an alien artifact (this aspect may offend some of the more harcore christians out there, but please understand that in Japan christianity is not the dominant religion). The whole high school kid working for a secret organization thing is pretty unorigional especially among anime films. The movie is really nothing more than action with a decent plot which is really more of an excuse for violence. Of course with that said the movie does do it's job for it's 90 min running time it entertains and entertains well. The lack of plot and creativity just makes it hard to come back to (although there are some awesome visuals). Basically good but not great."
1,Positively awful!,"I've seen my share of anime over the years, and this was quite possibly the worst of the lot. An almost criminal waste of quality animation on what must be the most ill-conceived storyline and characterization ever to inflict itself upon unsuspecting audiences. How Mr. Otomo could have allowed himself to be involved in this production is simply beyond me. Thank God it was never released to the movie-going public in the States. It's not even fit for the arthaus/independent film circuit. If you want interesting characters or involving plotlines, check out Akira or Ghost in the Shell. Spriggan is best left on the shelf to gather dust."
3,"Impressive from a distance, fails to deliver","The artwork in Spriggan is clearly impressive off the back of the box. The plot is fairly well organized and intended. However, during the actual course of the script, I think many essential details were omitted (perhaps due to time restrictions - I can only hypothesize, having not read the manga). It's over simplified and very rough in some ways. However, the action is very impressive and the artwork is beautiful. A recomended view."
3,pff! Not what it was all stacked up to be...,"Sadly id have to say that this movie hardly met my expectations. i heard from my friends that ""it was all cool"" and ""u need to see it"" and ""its the coolest anime movie yet"". but i should've known, this movie's pplot is simply monognous (boring) there are no twists or surprises or anything to keep me interested.and the ""evil all powerful colonel"" kid was a bad idea, it was simply dumb(would use a different word but i know it will get cencored) the little 7 year old sounded like a girl and the ""geneticly enhanced super killing human robot"" has been used soo many times you can guess the ending. dont get me wrong i think others like Evangelion, Sin, Samuria X, Gasaraki, and a lot others are just freakin cool. but this spriggan was a total let down."
3,Just ok,"This dvd is one of my blind purchases. Overall, I think it is quite ok. not really a fantastic show. It talks about a guy trying to stop a evil kid from destroying the world. This anime is filled with actions. The drawing is ok but nothing to scream about. But at the last part, the drawing is quite good. If you like actions anime, you might want to take a look at this."
3,...Nothing Amazing...,"If you're an action loving okatu, then this movie is the thing for you. However, if your're looking for a good intellectual movie you have to THINK about, don't even give this movie a second look, (I suggest Jin-Roh the Wolf Brigade).The animation isn't wonderful, but it's decent, near the end of the movie, it's not hand drawn like the beginning, and looks better.If you're turned off by the religion, don't worry, there is very little reference to it.Over all the villans and heros are unoriginal, and can be boring at times, except Jean...but the story and animation aren't the worst things ever, much like the characthers, so it deserves a decent rating.Basically, don't expect this anime to have you thinking and marveling at it weeks later."
5,ZZZZZ.....,"I don't think I've heard this entire CD through to the end yet. The first night I tried it, I was really wound up - thinking about my day at work and the upcoming day, and other issues that normally keep me from falling asleep. When I first started the CD, I said to myself ""yeah, right, this works - NOT""... I don't even remember falling asleep!! I slept nearly through the nite, and turned it on again when I awoke and slept the rest of the nite through. My only suggestion is once your alarm clock goes off, don't hit the snooze and listen to this CD!! You're sure to not want to get up!"
3,Useful,Good read and reference for those who are uninitated to the ways and means of stamp/coin collecting. The methods and principles discussed are still relevant today. It's only that many of the albums depicted and endorsed are probably long out-of-print....
1,By the VHS version instead,"This outstanding (five star) movie has illegible captions in the DVD version. If you want to be able to read the captions, buy the VHS version instead. Only get the DVD if your Japanese is good enough to understand the movie without captions."
1,"Great Movie, poor DVD","This movie is quite good. Not exactly like Tanpopo but it's a fascinating movie with memorable characters. Unfortunately, the DVD version is absolutely terrible. The DVD version of Tanpopo is a hundred times better. It's very clear that this was a sloppy job. It's nothing but a very poor VHS transfer of the movie to DVD. Bad thing is that the DVD highlights the imperfections of the original VHS so that even people like me can see it. The quality of picture is fuzzy and the subtitles are the ones from the VHS (not DVD subtitles). This results in words that are impossible to see in some scenes and hard to read in all the others since the picture quality is quite fuzzy. Unless you are a die-hard fan of this movie, you're better off spending your money getting the DVD of Tanpopo. The DVD of Tanpopo is not perfect but the quality is still reasonable good and sharp and much better than this ... job."
2,Classic movie undone by dvd remastering,"I have two copies of this movie-one on VHS and this one on DVD. I received the DVD as a present. Itami is one of the greatest modern directors in Japan who unfortunately committed suicide. This movie was enormously popular in Japan and deservedly so with its many touches of black humor, story, writing, acting and direction. The VHS is quite watchable. However, when I put the DVD on I immediately had to adjust my picture settings to even see the picture. It's unclear and fuzzy throughout the movie. In all of the film the English subtitling is difficult and sometimes impossible to read. I would say it is a prime candidate for a recall by the company. Since I can't give separate ratings for the movie vs. the DVD treatment I'm forced to give it 2 stars."
2,Very poor transfer for a good movie,"The film is thoroughly enjoyable as long as one cares about something else than our Hollywoodized culture. But the digital transfer is terrible, to the point that a VHS copy is just as well."
1,Worthless bootleg,This is a pirated copy of the Japanese Region 2 release. To charge anything for it is highway robbery.
2,not exactly a Tampopo but does the job,I was a little disappointed after having loved Tampopo. The humour is subtle and very Japanese although there is an underlying sense of bathos as we actually take pity on the antagonists. Fantastic performances by Miyamoto and Yamazaki.
3,Did not arrive,This item never arrived. I have given it 3 stars because I suspect that the problem is not with the vendor.
4,Interpretation: Techniques and Excercises,"Very good book. It adresses more United Nations interpreting but may also be applied to other areas. It will require a seasoned interpreter or faculty to point out the differences with other fields of interpreting, such as medical or legal."
5,An Excellent Product.,"My wife and I just bought another mega-pack of shaving gel at our local warehouse store. This time it's Gillette Satin Care for sensitive skin and I've been using it for the past week. It's an excellent product. It gives a nice smooth shave and I haven't had any problems at all. We have a can that gives a 20% bonus, but otherwise it's the same as listed here. We both use the same product for our shaving needs.All shaving gels are so much alike that it means little difference to us what the brand is or what secret ingredients it has to solve one's particular needs. It also makes little difference as to whether it's billed for a man or a woman. We buy the mega-packs and go through them over the period of about a year, with me using the great bulk. As such, our costs are rock bottom. Perhaps you do the same thing in that this is also a mega-pack. It's an excellent product, just as good as any other we've used.Gary Peterson"
5,Great!,Was on schedule and was more than satisfactory. I would recommend this product to everyone because i really like it.
5,Our knife block was missing these essentials,"After years of making due with generic shears for our kitchen, we finally looked for and found these. Our Henckels knife block has the hole for shears, and now we finally have the item to fill the void."
4,kitchen shears,"item was exactly what I ordered, quality was good and strong, I would definetly recomend this product to my friends. Item was delivered on time ."
2,Something's missing...,"On this cd, Charli Baltimore pretty much has the Lil Kim type style down pat. But something's missing. Even on the songs with cussing, this cd is boring to listen to. The songs are just kind of formulatic, and unlike Lil Kim and Foxy, she doesn't have the charisma and talent to make you overlook the cd's weaknesses. She is certainly pretty, but her rapping skills are kind of limited. You would be better off investing in an artist with more staying power."
2,"Slow paced, not challenging at all","I was looking for something with more elements of dance such as Ballet moves incorporated into a workout. There was little to do with Ballet in the program. The sceneries in this workout are, as a matter of fact, amazing!! However, my criteria of a great workout is 1) content 2) content 3) content. It was a relaxing workout but there are lots of other better choices out there with more reasonably priced."
1,NOT ENOUGH mAh,"For the price this is a horrible battery. This battery has a very very low mAh rating for this style of battery, and it will be very evident the first time you use it! Even though it is a 7.2V battery the mAh rating is only 1600, the mAh rating is among other factors, how long the battery will hold its charge. I recommend a 7.2V battery to be rated 3000 mAh this will provide a much better and longer driving experience. Do a little searching and you will find most 7.2v batteries of this style are rated at least 2600 mAh. I really do not understand how anyone could sell this battery for the prices I have encountered. The educational value of this toy is rated very high by me because if you buy one you will learn very quickly this battery will not hold a charge long enough to enjoy it!"
4,Wrong item,"My little bro' was searchin for the John Cena's Spinning Belt,and with the picture and the product description,he ordered it,but the one he got was the NWO one,a little ugly by the way,and i think Amazon should fix that problem,they have a product name,but with another picture and product description,and kids dont read,they order what they see,and well,i dont know about wrestling,so i told him was right to order that item,but now is crying out loud because he got the uglyest one...Please,fix that and don't make another kid cry. Thanks"
2,Similar to Highlander 2 . . .,"Marc Singer and Sarah Douglas are the high points of this film. Marc Singer is, of course, the Beastmaster. His acting and action scenes are up to par. Sarah Douglas is the witch/sorceress, and her talent and charm are obvious. Even Wings Hauser as the big bad guy has his moments, so all is not lost.However, the script is full of bad 80s slang. Characters make decisions that do not make any logical sense. One early section of dialgue is so bad that I had to stop the tape. And the music is bad 80s hair-rock.Beastmaster 2 is similar to Highlander 2. The second movie of each series is almost unrelated to the original movie. The basic concepts are present in each sequel, but they go horribly astray.All of that aside, Beastmaster 2 has some good moments. Beastmaster 3 brings the series back on track, but that is a different movie . . ."
4,BeastMaster 2,"I'm a very big movie buff and especially with old sci-fi & fantasy movies. This was an excellent movie in my opinion, it has action, adventure and Marc Singer still does a great job of playing Dar. Of all 3 Beast Master movies, number 1 & 2 are my favorites by far, but all of them are worth watching if you like these types of sword and sorcery movies, I just don't under stand why the companies that own the rights don't release these on DVD it is beyond me. This would make a great 3 pack series to buy; I noticed on Youtube.com that there are Extras like a news clip on the making of the second movie and the original trailer, so have fun watching yours truly Anx.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0utmT_Q0Zwg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV6Jk5OFfDY"
3,"Very good movie, [bad] tape, poor picture quality !","This movie is fantastic. The only problem I have with this VHS Cassette is that they recorded it using Extended Play (EP). That means they sacrificed picture quality to fit the movie on less video tape. It's a very [poor] trick. If you plan to buy this movie (which, again is great !!!) please wait for the DVD because this VHS version has poor picture quality."
5,Every song is Great,"I bought this CD this first day it came out, The songs are great, everything from Tek Set to Bedroom Bounty Hunter to the hit Oh Carolina. I wish Shaggy would go back to the sounds of this album"
2,Haven't installed the rack yet...,"I haven't installed this rack on our vehicle yet, but I plan to do so. My complaint is about the packaging and missing hardware:The box was junk. It had plainly been opened and some of the hardware robbed out of the hardware bag. The box was then roughly taped up and shipped on it's way. If the packaging is torn up this bad, and the seller decides to send it out despite of it's condition, how can I have reasonable trust this item has all of it's parts and instructions."
3,Warning: Spare Tire on back door!,"Great hitch-mount bike rack for a fair price with the exception that it doesn't fit on vehicles that put spare tires on the back (such as the 2008 Rav4 we installed it on.)I didn't read any reviews warning us about that.We thought we were saving $50 by getting this instead of a Thule/Yakima rack, but that savings is going to be eaten up by purchasing a hitch extension.Lame, very very lame."
2,should be designed better.,It's good to hold 4 bikes. But I can't open the rear hatch door. I saw other similar product that can lower the rack and let people open the rear hatch door.
4,really good rack great value,"This rack works very well. It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. I've shopped around for a better deal and am convinced there is not a better deal for a rack of this type anywhere. I highly recommend this rack at this price. It was even worth it with the shipping upgrade. 120 bucks,You can't beat it."
2,"Worked well for awhile, but Allen customer service not so good","We had this bike rack for a couple of years with no complaints, but when a 30 cent bolt sheared off and I contacted Allen customer support for a replacement part, they were of no help. Because of how the bolt sheared off, I needed to replace the entire horizontal support at the top of the bike rack, but they wouldn't sell me just that one part. I can't get the sheared bolt out, so the entire back rack is now headed for the trash bin.So, I won't be buying another Allen bike rack, and I would think hard before doing so yourself. I'm going to seek out a brand like Thule that hopefully has better customer support....sigh"
3,bike hitch rack,"tongue was too short and did not mount in hitch and allow rack to work without contacting the car. had to add extension to bring rack out from back of car, 4 inches added. Cost me additional $38. Very sturdy rack for the price.."
1,Lack of customer service,Worked ok for a while but then bent with 4 bikes. Destroyed 2 new bikes. No response from Allen after numerous attempts. Finally connected but they said they would not do anything. Consider any other mfr.
4,Good purchase.,"Very happy, works great, easy to install. I have a Honda Element and it fits very well on it."
5,Good Value,"Strong Sturdy Frame. Nice lowering mechanism, but quite difficult to do with 3-4 bikes onboard (heavy to get back up). Bikes hold securely on frame.Good Value. I would definitely recommend."
5,"Simple, functional, and looks good","The box from FedEx suffered some damage, but the unit was in good shape. Putting it all together and attaching it to the car was quick and easy... took about 15 minutes. The bikes easily strap down to the rack and come off just as easy. There was some slight wobble to the unit at a joint in the vertical post, but nothing to be concerned about. When you're not carting bikes around, the mounting portion folds down, and the whole unit can tilt back to about a 45 degree angle for easy access to the trunk of your car.Lately I've been taking a closer look at bike mounts on other cars, and this one looks a lot nicer that just about any other brand I've seen. The only minor problem is that there really isn't any way to burglar-proof the bikes unless you somehow chain them to some part of the frame of your car, but this is probably an issue with just about any bike mount. Just don't leave them out of sight for too long. Overall, I would highly recommend this Allen rack."
5,Great Product. Great Value,"No issues, no problems. Works great as intended. There is no strap required from the top of the carrier to the vehicle as another reviewer claimed.Good Value. Solid rack. There is no need to buy name brand. This works as well or better than some. The folding arms are a must. Some of the name brand racks don't have this option.As other reviewers have indicated the rack does not lock in place with a standard two inch receiver hitch pin. Instead a shoulder bolt with nylon lock nut is used. The shoulder bolt works to pinch the rack to one side in your vehicle receiver tube. Works great to eliminate side sway."
3,Competent product,"This is a well constructed product generally. The bike restraints should be rubber instead of nylon but they will basically do the job. The nylon restrains that come with the frame do not competently keep bikes apart. You can, however, use Thule one's as they fit. Best for two bikes ... three or more require removal of seats and turning of HBars."
4,Great book for highschool elective!,Purchased this book (along with the Small Gas Engines textbook) for my 11th grade homeschooler to use for an elective.The only thing lacking is if you are using this for this purpose there are no tests but they can be purchased from another source. We are looking forward to learnig much! For an adult just wanting to learn the basics no testing is required.
1,workbook does not help at all... need the textbook,I thought I was buying the textbook but I received the workbook. Nothing in the buyer's title stated it wasn't the textbook.
2,Very old software,"I used this version of the software several years ago and it was not bad, but I would not recomend it today. This version is just too old and is certainly not worth the $750 which it is currently priced at.-Mike"
2,"Belkin Kaiser Napa, feminine and not well represented","Unfortunately this item was not at all what I was expecting or wanted. Amazon did not have a pic, but I chekced other wesites and found the same pic on each one, none acturately represented the case.The exterior of the front is very feminine. It has stiching that makes in appear padded into diamond shapes."
5,Another great Eleanor Burns book,"Once again, Eleanor Burns, the founder of Quilt in a Day, shows you how to make several variations of this quilt using her strip-pieced method. The instructions and illustrations make this a great book for the beginning quilter."
5,Irish Chain in a Day,This looks SOO Easy. I have to get one of these done. Maybe next year. Great detail and instruction. Worthy of being in my library of books.
5,Gates Quality for Import Pricing,The Gates radiator hoses that I purchased fit exactly and are Gates quality. The pricing is less than half of auto parts store pricing.
5,Fits the Bill!,"Got two of these packs for the wife and I. We're out on the mountain 20+ days a year and always looking to make sure we have everything we need to stay warm or to be able to shed layers. This pack works out great for just that. I am able to keep everything I want in there including my goggles in the helmet in the mesh pocket which works out great.Great amount of storage. Well balanced bag and seems nice and sturdy. Good buy, short money and fits the bill."
4,teleskier,The first one I got ripped out. The supplier replaced it and said the new pack was made with a better material. He was correct. Much better now. Great way to carry your gear.
5,Excellent,"This product is everything I wished for. It keeps my boots attached to the bag without loosing all the interior space. My father has a bag with the boots inside and there is not as much room for your ski pants, coat and other items you want to take with you. It is also nice having the external mesh for the helmet. Only point to remember is to put your boots on the bag first to allow them to get secured properly. If you fill the bag first then it is more difficult putting the boots on. Great purchase!!"
2,Weak on Diesel,"This book is incomplete, vague, and generally weak when it comes to the diesel system it purports to cover. I'm having trouble finding a better book, however."
4,Excellent stuff to be found here...,"This offering by Panamanian Azuquita features some d*mn fine numbers. ""Salsa Na' Ma'"" is done just as much justice as it was by Charlie Palmieri. ""Guajiro Bacan"" gets, hands-down, a full ten-star, two-thumbs vote. It's is absolutely outstanding and gets no better than that. Other numbers, such as ""California"" are great as well. The line up here features such legendary people as Jimmy Sabater, Kako, Louie Ramirez and Adalberto Santiago. With that kind of crew backing up Azuquita, it really can be no wrong, despite a couple of semi-annoying disco-infused numbers. Get this and enjoy."
4,Exciting!!!!!!,For someone that is looking for exotic and exciting... this book gives inspiration again & again! You could even pull tidbits of inspiration from this book for a cleaner look if you know what you're looking for.
1,The worst cd ever made,"Yeah, if there happens to be one other person besides my friends and the other guy who wrote a review on Barry G, who knows who he is, I would be very surprised. This is quite possibly the worst cd ever made. I hate to admit that I do still own it. But I only bust it out on special ocassions, like when I'm depressed and want to laugh, or when I want to make other people laugh. I bought the cd at a youth camp that he was performing at. I met Barry and he signed my cd cover and everything. I can't believe that me and my friends used to think he was good. Anyways, Barry G, if you're out there reading this by some huge chance, no offense bro, I got nothing but love for you baby."
2,More About Noah Adams Than About Piano,"This is a nice little story about someone who buys an $11,000 piano, but doesn't really have time for practicing. The story often rambles away from talking about piano, and towards the LL Bean, chocolate lab, yuppie lifestyle of the author. This one sentence from the book sums it up:""The Inn is lovely -- I especially like the lighting in the bathroom; it makes me look happy and rested..."""
2,piano playing sans piano teacher,"mr. adams book was a sad disappointment to this adult beginner piano player. his chapters follow the calendar year beginning with the purchase of an expensive piano. for the next 9 months he tries to learn with a computer program and audio tapes and by interviewing pianists and piano makers. perhaps he thought the latter would transmit their skills by osmosis. i wondered after finishing the book if adams, as a successful broadcast journalist, avoided a piano teacher because of the very real terror of failing every week, (so far in my first 3 months)to get anything right. the hints about practise and technique i was hoping for, were sought in vain. as i said a sad disappointment."
2,Not Enough Piano,"I was instantly intrigued by this book. I was disappointed that of the 242 pages, it take until page 181 for him to decide to even play Traumerei for his wife.Quite frankly, this book is filled with self indulgant nonsense. If Adams had stuck to the idea of writing a book about just learning piano , it would have been fine. Instead he meanders onto subjects such buying boats and taking trips. What does any of that crap have to do with playing piano?I think Noah Adam's experience is very indicative of the ""I want everything now with little work"" philosophy that pervades our country. I have very little doubt that the exquisite Steinway he bought has either been sold or is gathering dust. What a shame."
4,"Ironic title, but a good read","The irony of ""Piano Lessons"" is that it's not about taking piano lessons at all, at least not weekly piano lessons with a teacher, and so you might read this book as a primer on how NOT to learn to play the piano.That said, I enjoyed this book and found it to be a lovely meditation on the beauty of the piano and the difficulty of fitting an amateur passion into a busy, career-laden schedule. I thought to myself that if a fine writer and talented journalist such as Adams could take such a weird approach to learning to play - erratically using music software and turning his back on his lovely new Steinway! -- then I shouldn't be afraid to try. It's been a year since I read ""Piano Lessons,"" and I now own a piano, am six months into weekly piano lessons and am at the skill level where I could play ""Traumeri"" (although I haven't tried to do so). ""Piano Lessons"" helped kick-start my own musical adventure.How's it going with you, Noah?"
2,"Long On Talk, Short On Lessons","I was interested in reading the book becasue I recently returned to playing the piano after 30 years and I thought it would be fun to read someone else's experience on the trials and tribulations learning or relearning the music and buying a piano. Unfortunately, Mr. Adam's short reminisecne was short on information about actual playing and such and more about his very busy life with NPR. His book also suffers from ""name dropitis"" and a sometimes an elitist tone. Passages about ""overfed"" mall shoppers in ""stonewashed"" jeans -- followed by the author's refuge to an organic juice bar was plebian writing. I was most appalled by the fact that Mr. Adams purchases an incredibly expensive piano before even being able to read music! I found his struggle and his inability to ""get going"" and play very inaccessible to me as reader."
4,Should adults learn to play a musical instrument? YES!,"What a great read! I'm so glad I found this book. I lived every moment with the author as he went through his year of learning to play the piano at age 51. My only dilemma is: should I or should I not invest the time to learn the piano at age 50? I really think I will, knowing better what to expect because of Noah Adam's journey."
5,A treat for new students of music and other readers,"The reader learns about Noah Adams of National Public Radio, starting and sticking with a musical instrument as an adult, and more in a thoroughly enjoyable, short book.I was pleased and a bit disappointed when I finished ""Piano Lessons."" I was glad to have heard Adams' story and sorry that I could not return to hear more. (Adams does recommend books by other authors.)One reason I chose to read his book now: I recently began learning to play nylon-stringed guitar -- my first instrument (if you don't count ""song flute"" in elementary school and a pass at a desktop keyboard as an adult). My age: 49. My musical talent: none"
2,`Die yuppie scum' comes to mind,"A few years ago, `Die yuppie scum' was a popular bumper sticker. This book could inspire a comeback of that sticker. Smug, pretentious, rich enough to buy an 11,000 piano, expensive software audio tapes, and a sailboat in the same year, he gives capitalism a bad name. I don't get a sense of his love of the piano as much as his love of himself."
1,Nothing learned,"An awful book. A preening book. A silly & self-satisfied book.Adams spends most of it avoiding his piano; attending tweelittle piano workshops, fussing with some witless computerpiano lessons, buying a boat with a literary pedigree (E.B.White!), wondering about those drab people in malls whowear bright white sneakers & lack boats with a literarypedigree, and piddling on with his busy life. Meanwhile,his Steinway sits there! Hey, Noah Adams, if you don't havethe time to put it to use, send me the piano! And throw inthe bench, too! Also, whoever wrote ""die yuppie scum"", c'mon over and we'll have a sing-along! Everybody else, read ""Men, Women & Pianos"" by Arthur Loesser for its wit and depth,even if it is way out of date. Or ""The Piano Shopon the Left Bank"" by Thad Carhart, a short book that's likepornography for piano lovers."
3,You'd rather play your computer than your STEINWAY?!,"Let's get one thing straight! $11,000 is not alot for a fine musical instrument - it doesn't lose half its value as it rolls out of the showroom, ok? That said, it is disturbing that someone whose livelihood depends on human contact and communication should think that he could learn to play the piano expressively using a book or computer program! (I won't even start in on the idea of practicing on a soulless electronic keyboard when you own a Steinway). Certainly Noah Adam's wonderfully intimate writing is not a product of those methods - I dare say he had several caring, lively, human teachers. I only hope that now he finds one to lead him to the pleasure of the learning process - and then writes about his second year at the piano."
4,Piano Dreams,"What a wonderful, uplifting, book! Having begun playing the piano again after nearly 40 years away from it, I found myself enjoying Noah Adams descriptions of his joys and frustrations, exhaulting in his successes, and actually learning a few things to boot.A number of people ranted about the fact that Adams spent 11K on a piano. Having diddled around on a number of pianos before purchasing a used Yamaha upright, I can attest to the fact that there are pianos that can not only make even badly played music sound good but seem to call out to you when you touch them. Adams was in the fortunate position of being able to afford a piano that ""spoke"" to him, despite his somewhat unorthodox method of learning to play it.For an entertaining, enjoyable read, I definitely recommend Piano Lessons."
4,Noteworthy,"Noah Adams is best known as a commentator on the National Public Radio network's All Things Considered. His gentle humor and thoughtful insights translate well into print form.In ""Piano Lessons,"" Adams conveys the attraction of music, even for those of us who have little experience or talent in producing it. He details the course of a year in his life, a year when he decided to invest in a piano and learn to play it. Adams mainly used self-teaching methods, but also participated in a session with a private teacher and attended a week long music camp.Besides chronicling the routines of practicing and acquiring a greater familiarity with the instrument, Adams' book branches off to cover other aspects of his life during the time, and a sizable amount of history of the piano and of notable pianists, past and present. Those tangents are mostly interesting and enjoyable, thanks to Adams' polished prose style."
1,Not worth it!!!,This book is boring I did not like it even a little.. I would not and could not recommend it....I believe two words can wrap this book up tiresome & slow............
3,Appendix,"Dear Pan Sonic fans, I just want to tell you that there's an album out called ""Endless"" by VVV. VVV is a collaboration between Pan Sonic and Suicide's singer Alan Vega. I thought it could be of interest to you because this item is not listed unter Pan Sonic. Check it out, it's worth a listen (4 stars)."
1,Keebler Cups +/- Ice Cream = Terribleness,"Those silly elves...they actually think that cardboard is tasty! Well, we'll see if our bird friends like 'em. Hopefully, they do not pass away after ingesting these travesties of the Keebler realm. I know that I would. The box they come packed in probably tastes better. Give these to your children when they annoy you...they will never act up again, nor ask for ice cream ever again. O.K., I'm done.Update, 9/1/11, 12:01 PM: The birds have not touched them as of yet."
4,A huge hit at my house!,"This game is fun for kids who are fluent readers and for adults too! The playdough like material can dry out, but otherwise the game is very hardy and ours has seen a lot of use! The younger kids tend to choose the group activities when they have the option, just because it's more fun that way. The older kids do as many solo activites as possible, in order to gain strategic advantage on the board. We've worn out the original deck and have started on a booster pack (sold separately) as we've played this so many times! Cranium Cadoo is truly a fun game for the whole family, not just the little ones!"
1,Leaks,The flask leaks at the seams making it a pretty useless flask. There isn't much else that needs to be said about it.
4,exactly what you expect,"if you've ever seen a metal flask made in china before, this is the exact same thing.brushed finish on sides (doesn't show every little smudge and fingerprint) polished on the top and bottom.sized nicely for a pocket.unless i'm sharing i find filling it up about half-way to be the max as leaving it in there too will give it a metallic aftertaste."
1,Leaking Leaking Leaking,This flask lasted about 20 days and 2 uses before it started leaking and soaking my belongings that were along with it.thanks for nothing
2,"Good flasks, missing 2","The flasks worked well, but I only received 4 of the promised 6. Still, not an awful price for 4. If I had time, I would have returned the flasks for a replacement, but they had to be given out as gifts, I had to make do with what I had."
2,you get what you pay for,"I purchased these flasks because they seemed like such a good deal, but in the future I will definitely pay more for a better product. The solder seams were very crudely finished compared to others I've purchased before, and a couple of the caps weren't threaded to close easily. The price point was incredibly low, however, so if someone needs quantity, I suppose these would meet the need."
3,Poorer quality than expected,The part of the flask that holds the lid on is made out of very cheap plastic. Very flimsy. I should have paid more for a better product...
4,"Fun, useful guidebook","This is one of the better guides. I like they way they are set up, chapters covering one subject, (ex: accomodations) then an alphabetized list and map of all the sites. I use this book a lot when I need to look up an address or phone number.It could have more, but works perfectly well as it is."
3,Too much is missing,"After buying this book I began appending it with my own notes gleaned from the internet, my own experience, and other books. After awhile I ran out of margins - in other words there is allot of information that should be in this book but it's missing. This is especially true in the Dining section. Although no guidebook should cover all restruants in a city, all should cover the notable ones."
1,You will learn nothing from this book,"This book is useless in learning change management. There are very few directions, methods or models. There is no thread. The author seems to have written every thought that came to mind in the moment of writing. I am sure the author is an expert in the field, but he has no idea of teaching or writing books."
5,Masterful blend of history and storytelling,"Spanning centuries of British history, The Forest keeps the reader engrossed with the lives and emotions of its characters. Not only does Rutherfurd offer a continuing saga of the various families who inhabit the area, but also a natural history, detailing the behavior of the deer and the cycle of the trees, which form a constant backdrop for the human drama. The author's command of the language and of interesting tidbits of knowledge, such as the process of charcoal production, make this a very satisfying read. It was a great book to settle in with for the summer."
4,History alive!,"Rutherfurd's style makes English history come alive for me! In ""The Forest"", we follow inhabitants on a timeline spanning centuries, with interwoven ancestries and fascinating insights. My only regret is that Mr. Rutherfurd was not able to expand on each character; I would love to hear more!"
4,The Forest is a Good Read,"Most everything I order from Amazon.com comes in a timely manner and with few exceptions, in respectable condition. Rutherford's The Forest is pretty darn good read. It's an entertaining way to spend an afternoon."
4,James Michener is alive and well!,"Even though Michener died four years ago, Mr. Rutherfurd has picked up his spirit and has done a great job. I recommend the Forest to anyone who is a fan of Michener, and to anyone who loves to get lost in great stories."
1,Another Disappointment,"I read 'The Forest' because one of the places mentioned in the book is my home town, Ringwood. I enjoyed the author's first historical fiction, 'Sarum', but couldn't finish 'London' because of the sloppy writing and editing. 'The Forest' is another disappointment. He is now writing to formula and getting very lazy. All his research ends up in the story whether it relevant or not. It disrupts the narrative, which is poor at best. The characterisation is weak, the plot lacks tension and the section on the thoughts of the deer is laughable. An opportunity to write an exciting and interesting novel about a beautiful area has been missed."
3,"A little disappointing, frankly","Having read ""Russka,"" ""Sarum,"" and ""London,"" I couldn't wait to get my hands on Rutherfurd's latest, ""The Forest."" But it just didn't measure up to the author's previous endeavours. For one thing, it is far, far shorter, and I felt that either it didn't do justice to the full history of the New Forest, or perhaps the author ought to have chosen a more historically deep setting. Starting in 1099 seemed like a sell-out, after his previous novels, which often began several thousand years ago. For another, I agree with one reader who said that Rutherfurd was going formula on us. Though it is a genre, it seems that his techniques -- for example, in distinguishing members of a same family -- are all too familiar. However, ""The Forest"" is still a good read, and perhaps standing alone, it would rate 4 or 5 stars. But in comparison to ""London,"" for example, ""The Forest"" just doesn't rate..."
4,Light reading for genealogues,"Another thoroughly enjoyable historical voyage by Rutherfurd. While I personally find Rutherfurd less engaging than Michener, he gives a vivid portrayal of the place and the people that make it up. I have some trouble with his anthropomorphic depictions of deer and trees. However, the archetypical families, which evolve through what amounts to several novellas, make a very satisfying read."
3,a good summer read,"If you want a good summer read by all means pick up Edward Rutherfurd's the Forest. It is by no means a heavy read but a solid enjoyable romp through history. There are loads of details, lots of twists and enough interesting characters to keep you moving along at a brisk pace."
5,Reminiscing Life,I have to say that I am sad that Edward Rutherford hasn't written more. This book immerses you into the life of the forest throughout its history. The writing is so vivid that you almost feel as if you were there throughout these times. If Mr. Rutherford reads this I can only say: write more please!
4,Not quite Sarum,"Gave an excellent picture of ""The Forest"" but it seems that the author got tired about 3/4s of the way through and then found his 2nd wind for the final sprint."
2,"too, too much","A very very tough read. This could be condensed into about 5o pages and still have the same result. I was tempted to just stop, but I always finish even though the going is sometimes difficult. Some wheat within the chaff. But I won't be reading the rest of his series."
3,I find it a bit uneven,A good yarn but overcomplicated.I feel that it was intended almost as a documentary instead of a good read.Still the historical facts a fascinating.
3,A weaker entry but still enjoyable,"Of the first four books in the Edward Rutherford series, this fourth entry, The Forest, is the weakest one. It covers little new ground historically than the previous two English books, Sarum and London, already did. Thankfully, the book is also a third of the size of its predecessors. As far as characters, though, the book is just as excellent. It brings to life many interesting characters both fictional and historical, dating back from the Norman conquest to the present day. The ones who stood out the most were the characters from the time of Queen Elizabeth I's reign. A mother who wants England restored to Catholicism more than anything is the most memorable. Otherwise, though, it is a welcome relief that the next three books in the Rutherford series finally move away from England and explore new territory and history."
3,Doesn't last!!!,"I don't normally leave reviews, but thought this item needed one given my experience. I have now had THREE of these in 3 different vehicles. Each one died almost exactly 2 years upon using it. The first time I was miffed, the second time suspicious, now I am pretty convinced: This is a nice product that works very well but simply doesn't last. You can purchase with confidence if you don't plan on having it very long but I wouldn't expect a very durable product."
1,how could you?,let my child and apparently children all over the country buy a toy that you could not provide the support for? No store has it and and the batmobile we are all looking to run sits in the living room with my child staring at what was his big gift for the holiday season.Amazon and Toys R Us should be ashamed.
5,"""fast lane"" 9.6V battery pack and car","Although this is the best rc car I've ever owned, the batterpack still seems to wear down over time ( a pretty short period of time). I do follow all directions in the manuel, like using it up completely before recharging, giving it ten minutes to cool down, and not over or under charging it."
3,Absolute disappointment,Why is the battery for this toy so impossible to find? The hottest movie of the year and there are no batteries available for this toy. WHY!?! I look for the toy itself and amazon doesn't even make it simple to click to purchase the battery. Ridiculous!
4,Yet Another Who Knows Where The Time Goes...,"Okay, that being said I have to admit that THIS live version of WKWTTG is one of the best I have ever heard. Of course, Sandy and The F-Word have done several wonderful definitive versions and Judy Collins' studio take is simply a classic. I guess I have yet to hear a bad one (and who would want to anyway?!), but this one is different...the music is terrific (Ric Sanders on haunting violin) AND the three main female voices of Walmseley, Bolton & While, trading verses is stunning. It is truly worth the price of admission. The rest of the cd is well-played and sung and I am sure The Guv' had a super celebration, but I encourage fans to plunk down their hard-earned cash on the strength of this version alone. It is not available elsewhere and you will not be disappointed."
2,not the best,"When I bought this book on Amazon, it cost me 25 cents. That is about what it is worth. It is a shame that such an interesting topic as Papiamentu should be given such a slapdash treatment. A reviewer below seems to blame the editors, but the editors didn't write the thing, they just didn't fix it. I managed to finish the book despite the horrible writing, which goes beyond punctuation mistakes and repeated information. It is full of non-sequiturs, parenthetical notes (that do repeat the same information they are describing), subordinate clauses that do not refer back to anything, and a terrible overuse of the ""etc."". This all makes for a very confusing read. Fouse is not a writer or scholar - he is a former customs and DEA agent turned ESL teacher (check out his blog ""fousesquawk"") and is now a dilettante who chose a very interesting topic and bogged it down in such poor writing as to make excruciating. I give him credit for trying, though, and for his love of the language."
2,Too clunky,"Flossing the old-fashioned way (floss around the fingers) uses less floss and is less of a hassle. I gave it 2 stars because I could see how maybe if you had bad arthritis or something that prevented flexibility in the fingers it might be of use. For a healthy-handed person, it made the flossing experience clunky and used about three times as much floss."
1,short life,"Initially I was very pleased with the item. I ordered it Jan. 31, 2011 and received it the first week in February. I used it nightly, unfortunately it broke last night. The seller offered no help beyond referring me to the manufacturer. A 7 week life span is pretty short."
3,Good idea,I liked the idea behind this since flossing is very important and i forget to do it a lot. This works well but you really need fray proof floss for this to be easy to use. Regular floss frays and needs to be replaced quickly.
4,Does the job.,"This flosser is good at what it does. The only thing I think could be better is if it were a little smaller, but it's still a good product for super cheap."
1,Floss and snap,"I purchased the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder from teethnthings.com through Amazon. The plastic ""y"" snapped in half after about six months. I am not a vigorous flosser, but this instrument wasn't up to the job. And the shipping cost essentially doubled the price! No more ""flossaid"" for me."
3,Floss keeps on coming loose,"I love how this can be used over and over again, but every time I use it the floss gets loose. The design was also somewhat awkward in my mouth, because it's larger sized.Overall, I'd go withPlackers Dental Flossers Micro Mint - 75 Eaif you're looking into easing the flossing process and don't mind purchasing more every few months, and this if you're more for the environment and into saving money."
5,Great product,"Simply put, a great product at a great price.Flossing shouldn't be a chore, and this makes sure it isn't"
2,Waste a lot of floss,"These floss devices need to be able to rotate the floss around so you aren't using the same small section of floss for your entire mouth. It's quite an ordeal and waste of floss to set this thing up. Also, the holder is not as stiff as I'd like."
4,Nice product,"This product is cheap and shipment arrived in time. I still haven't started using this item, I still have to complete the use and throw Flossing sticks I brought at the Walmart. If you do flossing very often, this is a cheaper alternative."
1,Most stupid product ever!!!,"The device does not allow the tape to move, you need to use the same part over and over, and it takes a long time to adjust the tape on the stupid device."
5,Loved these since I was a kid.,"I have been using this style of flosser since I was in elementary school, and Flossaid's is great. Basically, you take a piece of floss, wrap it a couple times around the circular knob, stretch it up and over the forked part, and then bring it back down around the knob a couple more times while pulling it tight.I really don't like flossing the usual way (i.e., by wrapping it around both index fingers) because it cuts off blood circulation in my fingers -- not a very nice sensation. This little contraption maintains the tension of the floss without putting pressure on my fingers, thus allowing me to take more time to floss thoroughly and comfortably. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who finds flossing unpleasant, as well as to those who don't mind flossing. It does take an extra 5-10 seconds, but it makes the flossing process very easy and comfortable. Also, it's really cheap and lasts a long time."
1,4 months old and snapped,"After only 4 months my flossaid snapped by the brass rivet , I did write to the manufacturer to complain and I sent them a photo of the broken flossaid but they did not reply. I expected an item that is made in the USA by a an American manufacturer to have some type of gurantee but I was wrong."
1,Forget the best of how about a full set??,Boy am I glad that I decided to read the reviews on amazon before I actually considered buying this product. Why oh why couldn't they try hard enough to put those 2 lost doug episodes on this set?? Sorry viacom but I think I'll pass on this one at least until you rerelease this season and make it a full season 4 set. I mean it's not like we're asking for bonus features or anything like that we're just asking for 2 measly episodes. thanks you.
4,Aww yeah I knew years ago.,"Umm,yeah the other 2 lost episodes is on itunes and could be elsewhere where I wouldn't know and maybe here to watch on the laptop and pc and if you got a cool laptop it will feel good watching it like on the TV.But yeah I'm mad that the people who made this couldn't find the 2 so it wouldn't have that cheesy title ""best of"".Because all the episodes is really classic.There can be a favorite season but they all rock.Yeah so I would of put 5 stars if the people or Nickelodeon crew put the lost episodes there too so they wouldn't mess up the rep. on a really good show.Shout Factory is awesome.They been making all seasons of all the good Nickelodeon shows and episodes but they made a 2 part for a few Hey Arnold seasons.For season 2 and they will do it to Season 4 and 3 will be in one box set and 5 will be in one box set.Guess what everybody Late Feb 2013 Rockos Modern Life will have a whole series box set.All the episodes from season 1 to 4..."
3,Amazon Instant Video vs. DVD Release,"I have not purchased this product because as many have stated I would prefer a complete season release. I noticed that the two episodes not included on the DVDs due to technical issues appear to be available through Amazon Instant Video. Is there a plan to change season 4 to a complete season rather than a ""best of"" set since apparently these issues have been resolved??"
2,Best of? Best wait ....,"Really guys? It's essentially the entire season minus two episodes and you're calling it a ""Best Of""? ""Best of"" normally consists of 4-5 of the best episodes from the season not the whole season minus two episodes. Otherwise I'd be ordering ""Best of Star Trek: The Original Series"", is that also the whole series for $10 minus one or two episodes? The title of this set of laughable.It's more close to ""Doug: Season 4 and a half-ish""Thought about ordering this set back when I thought it was the whole season but I won't be doing that anymore. This is one of the problems with unofficial studio releases. Maybe I'll revisit this if a proper season 4 is released or if the episodes show up in a later season."
3,A little Dissapointing!,"I've been waiting for season 4 to come out, but when I purchased it, I realized that this DVD is missing 2 episodes: Doug's Bum Rap and Doug's Babysitter. And those were good episodes too. No wonder that they named it ""The Best of Season 4."""
2,Not the answer for me,"I have tested this CD several times and the results came out the same: I still could not sleep. It must work for some, based on the other reviews, but I found the melodies distracting if not annoying."
4,Works well enough for me!,"I found a clip of this on a different website and decided to give it a try to ease my insomnia. I have trouble sleeping the whole night through without interruption.That being said, I gave this a try and you know what? I only woke up once! That's a major improvement over a lot of other nights, and I was so very pleased.I'm not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about as far as the ""spikes"" in volume. I've now listened to this cd many times and have never had the problem of the music becoming so loud that it wakes me up. You would have to have the volume up very high to be woken by this, and surely that's not the proper volume for attempting to fall and stay asleep.At any rate, this recording probably won't work for everyone, but it worked well for me! I would recommend trying this over sleeping pills or a trip to your doctor!"
1,"Music was ok, made my insomnia worse.","The first night i tried this, i put it into the computer and let it play on repeat all night. I definately didn't go to sleep any faster than usual(it usually takes me 1-2 hours). I also woke up several times before giving up on my hopeless 7 hours for that night. The second night i figured my boyfriend's snoring could have countered the delta waves, so i synced the 2 tracks to my zune so i could use headphones. The same thing happened, except i believe i woke up more often than the night before, until i finally took off the headphones. I even tried it on a third night- when i began to feel tired i started listening to this music on my zune, but after an hour i just gave up. I actually like the music, it just doesn't help my sleeping at all. I guess I'll be sticking to the old school method of reading the Bible..."
1,Nope,Didn't do anything for me. I tried it for a week straight but ended up listening for 30 minutes and back to watching tv.
1,Health danger,"I was excited by this product, based on the reviews, and I went to sleep with it on, as many people have done. The thing is, it does SOMETHING - I was asleep in less than 30 minutes - but I don't like what it did. The entire next day, I felt like I was drugged, groggy, couldn't focus. Went home and threw the thing out, and I realized that yes, while sleep is important, messing around with brain waves is probably not the best way to go about it.Careful here. Do you really know what this stuff is doing?"
5,it's worked for me,it's a coglomorate of low slightly spooky music-like sounds that end up reminding me of the ocean. It does lull me to sleep (along with about 5 homeopathic and sleep remedies)---but none of these work without the other. The CD is a definite cog in the wheel of my vastly improved sleep!
2,made me jittery,While I have used this cd to help me go/or get back to sleep i find the pulsing a bit too fast and I wake up a bit jittery. It did not work as a relaxation tool.
1,No luck...,This didn't work for me. Kept me up with the noises. Was not melodic. Different volumes had me getting up to turn the vol up and down several times.Am sticking with the white noise machine.
3,Spooky at times but effective,"The Delta Sleep System is a useful CD that has helped me fall asleep most of the times I've used it. Nevertheless, when I'm already a bit anxious before bed, instead of calming and helping me sleep, it increases my anxiety and seems to me it's a little spooky. As other reviewers pointed out, I also have the different volume throughout the recording issue. This can be annoying or add to stress.Nevertheless, on other occasions it just knocks me out. I recommend trying it."
5,Works fabulously for a seven year old with longstanding insomnia,"My son has always had a hard time sleeping and has always needed music to go to sleep. We like the indigo dreams cds but they don't work nearly as well as this one. Anyway, it is very impressive and his sleep has really really improved and to boot, he really likes it."
2,Inconsistant sound,I bought this after a HUGE bought of insomnia and a late night reading reviews on here. I have to admit that I really didn't enjoy this CD. It woke me up after the track where it gets quiet then loud again.Here's what helped my sleep: a white noise machine and a homeopathic - coffea cruda. The coffea cruda is safe for nursing and pregnant women and has no side effects. It is the only thing that has helped. Maybe you are up at 3am like I was...it's worth a try! I'm sleeping soundly right now because of it.
2,Hmmm...Still Skeptical,"Delta Sleep I found to be monotonous. In my mind's eye I could see the obelisk from 2001 A Space Odyssey floating ever before me. I actually preferred, slightly, Dr. Thompson's Ambient Music of Sleep. It was more relaxing, though not sleep inducing. Perhaps some people might find both to be of value. The other reviews here, sadly for me, seem to indicate that it might just be me."
1,Glad we didn't pay much,"I would rate this ""sleep"" system lower than 1 if I could. It has not helped either my husband or I to get a single night's worth of decent sleep. In fact, it merely delays the beginning of sleep until at least the CD is over and we can turn it off. As others have commented, there are louder bursts of sound which pull us out of any beginnings of restfulness that the CD has achieved. I don't know how many more nights I'll try this before I throw it into the trash or sell it on e-Bay. It bewilders me where all the great comments come from. I'm going back to my fan, where I have at least the possibility of sleep."
2,Didn't put me to sleep,"I used this twice and both times found it did not put me to sleep, instead I lied awake through the entire CD and actually felt a bit annoyed by the music. Maybe this would work for some but it just did not work for me."
2,Another sleepless night...,"What a disappointment this CD was for me. I had read positive reviews about this CD, but unfortunately this piece of work didn't help me sleep at all. I have tried so many things for relaxation and getting to sleep, yet more $$ down the tubes. I'd love to hear about something that really works.~sleepless in Atlanta"
5,Excellent Sleep Therapy,"My BF had me buy this when I was suffering a terrible ear infection and could not sleep for days on end. For days I never heard the end of the first track. Where drugs made me feel nasty the next morning or didn't work fast enough, Dr. JT's cd was very effective. I sleep well when I play this.And If I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep I just hit play again and I'm gone.There is a lot of ambient sounds that mask the part that actually makes you sleep and there IS one point in the first track that is a bit louder and has actually awaken me a couple of times if I'm not in deep enough sleep but I have only heard this note thrice and i've had the CD for 3 years now."
1,For some reason did the opposite...,"I will try to give this another shot, but for some reason the sounds on this DVD did the opposite of what they were supposed to do, i.e. kept me awake! I have a problem with waking up and getting back to sleep, and usually use audio books to help me with that... I wanted to give this DVD a shot. Well, guess what, the sound actually kept me awake! As soon as I turned it off and put on my audio book, I fell back asleep! Maybe it's my brain... I will keep trying and see if maybe I had a delayed reaction!"
1,all I could do is toss and turn...,and try to figure out what strange music I was listening to. I am better off with white noise.
2,Heard good things about it... no luck for me,"Read lots of reviews of this cd... was hoping it would work for me. Heard it was good for fibromyalgia too. I keep listening to it, hoping I'll like it, but it sounds almost creepy. I wish I would have listened to a sound byte before buying."
1,Didn't work,"Bought this for my husband who has trouble falling asleep. It did not help him fall to sleep any faster. Maybe it helps people stay asleep - but that is not his problem. No help to fall asleep faster at all.DREAM WATER LULLABY LMN W/TEA , SLEEP & RELAXATION SHOTShas been the only thing to help him fall asleep in a reasonable amount of time."
2,Didn't work for me....,"I bought this CD as I fall asleep easily but wake after 4 hours. I listened to it 2 different times and each time I woke up after 2 hours and couldn't go back to sleep. It must be my brain doesn't care for ""Delta"" waves. But I haven't given up. I will try the ""Gamma"" one since I bought 3 at the same time and see if it might work. ??"
4,The only thing wrong w/this cd is you can't download it-,So if your spouse doesn't want to hear it...I have to sit in another room to listen-then go to bed-love to be able to put it on my mp3.plus my first one wore out fast- in only a few playings- love the effect it has!! Whatz up with inability to download it?
1,"ugh, not so good","Save your money, a radio turned off station will simulate the 'static', an upstairs use of plumbing at 2 a.m. will do the same for the water sounds. Any new age synthesiser CD can replicate The Delta Sleep System. Listing made for one of the longer nights of trying to sleep"
2,twiglight zone,after reading all rave reviews about how this works for everyone else.. it has yet to work for me... i was pretty dissapointed... i dont doubt it works for most of you but as soon as i put it on it freaked me out and made me stay up most of the night thinking about aliens and such as it sounds like a soundtrack to a sci-fi flick!good luck!
2,Good faith effort,"Well, I read the reviews and Dr. Thompson's website, ordered the CD and have tried it about fifteen times over the last few weeks. I would say, basically, it does not work for me any more, or any less, than any other relaxing music. It certainly does not inherently induce or sustain sleep. Sure wish it did, believe me."
4,Helpful sleep aid,"I've enjoyed most of Dr. Thompson's work and this Delta Sleep system is pretty effective. While I can't say it works every time, I'm happy with the results. Often, I will use other ocean wave or rain tracks played from one iPhone alarm clock while listening to this on the bigger sound system. The combination of nature's white noise and this CD works quite well for me. I also really like his meditation CDs, like the Alpha and Gamma."
4,Better sleeping,"If you're the type of person, who will dwell on something to the point of sleeplessness, Delta Sleep may help you by distracting your brain. I find it helpful when played at a very low level."
4,Delta Sleep System,I have purchased two CDs from the Dr Jeffrey Thompson series and both have been successful in lulling me intoa late afternoon nap for almost the duration of their 30 minute tracks. There are two 30 minute tracks on most of his CDs.It is difficult to know what real effect these recordings have on our brain waves but if nothing else they provide some non-distracting white noise. For some of us that is all we need to steer us away from our relentless thinking and send us into a needed state of slumber. On the other hand the Delta Sleep System has never put me to sleep for more than a 25 minute nap. But it is better than nothing.
3,Did little for me,"At first when I listened to the cd, it did help me fall asleep sooner than I normally do but it wasn't to the point that I could really see a big impact. I'm still suffering of sleep deprivation so I'm looking for something else. Hope it works for you."
1,Delta Sleep System,"I was really disappointed since the prior reviews where really good. It prevented me from falling asleep. I found some of the sounds extremely annoying. In addition when it came to the end, it created a chipping sound that even woke my husband up and I was wearing headphones."
5,Best night sleep in months...,"this might have saved my marriage. My wife snores, so this system ""drowns"" out her noise. I got the best night sleep (slept 7 hours straight without bathroom stop) for the first time in years.Set it to run with a GOOD quality system. I tried in my alarm clock CD player and the sound was not good. The system required a stereo with good quality base. The base sound is poor in most clock radios. A good bose system or at least a good amplifier/receiver and stereo speakers are a must IMO.UPdate March 2010: the system is on my Iphone. At night I plug it into a cradle/amplifier which produces good sound and recharges the battery. Still married..."
3,Not as effective as some solutions,"I've been using the much more expensive Holosyinc audio which is intended more for relaxation/meditation than sleep. Nonetheless it had been very effective for putting me to sleep. After a while this effect be came less so, so I tried this CD. It had no effect on me, probably because of my use of the Holosync."
2,Didn't work for me,"Heard good things about this product but it didn't work very well for me. In fact, I woke up in the middle of the night with my pulse racing. I didn't use it another night, so I think it might be worth trying for some people, but not me."
5,Clues in the Calico by Barbara Brackman,"This book is essential for anyone who wants to learn about antique quilts. Comprehensive information about textile technology, pattern dissemination, and chronology of stylistic influences on quiltmaking in the United States presented by the leading authority on quilt history."
5,"Good product, good service",I got my purchase very quickly and the product works great. You can charge your PDA any of 3 ways using the cable: 1) from your PC; 2) from the wall outlet with the AC current adapter; or 3) from you vehicle with the vehicle adapter. It's definately a winner. You save money too by getting the bundle.
4,Works very good,"I was surprised that this product would work so good, due to it's low price, but after using mine for over two years, I am very happy with it. It does what I need it to do.I gave it 4-stars because the plug that goes into the bottom of my Palm Pilot is kinda of loose, but if you leave it on a table, it will do what it's supposed to do."
2,ActiveSync charger,"While this charger does work, it does not have a button on it to initiate the charging action. That means that you must go to start, programs, Palm, and sync to make it work. Very inconvenient."
1,Dont buy,this dose not hot sync my palm E2 to my computer and the cable is a different one that they sent me then what is showed in the ad all it dose is charge
2,Poor Quality,"The sync charger doesn't connect well. I never did get a good sync and it only partially synced. After trying and re-trying and reloading the software, finally decided that the product is either defective or poorly constructed"
2,charge yes/ sync no,"Basically it's a decent little usb charging kit, but if you are like me and have a Palm TX *it does not work for hotsync* there is *no hotsync button*"
1,3 pcs USB Active Sync Charge Kit for Palm,"The 3 pcs USB Active Sync Charge Kit for Palm Tungsten T5, E2, TX, and Treo 650 that I purchased was garbage. I am still not able to sync my Palm with my computer. Total waste of money."
4,Iam satisfied,I received the product in good condition and Iam using it right now. No complaints whatsoever. thank you seller!
1,Defective Product,"My cable came defective. And the worst is, that the main cable came defective. I don't recommend anybody to buy the cable. Now, I can't charge my phone."
1,It does not work.,"I got this pluged in, the charger with wall point is working fine the USB cable doesn't work with the computer to sync the information between the computer and Palm Tungsten E2. Then wehn I tried to take it off or unplug it from the device it got stuck and I can not do anything with it now. I have to buy a new Palm or organizer for me. it is a total lose. I hate it. I have to manually input all information to another organizer from the Palm."
1,Never Received,"Despite repeated requests, advising seller that book was never received, they never responded - never gave any tracking information or satisfaction."
4,Well done,Comprehensive and accurately produced documentary. I enjoyed the lay out of the how the story was told. It's worth watching.
1,Very disappointing!!,"I purchased this item for my daughter's 2nd birthday. I intended to be able to push (roll) her around until she was able to ride herself. However, the foot pegs would not stay down and kept disappearing underneath, so if you are not watching, your child's feet or foot will get rolled under.(ouch) Since the foot pegs didn't work, my child tried to keep her feet on the peddles which turn as fast as you try to walk (and steer) and she could not keep her feet on the peddles either. Also, if your child is still learning how to steer, it is virtually impossible to push down the street safely. For the extra money, all you are getting is a sound effect gadget that is not very audible outside."
5,My son's favorite!!!!!,My son was given this toy as a present for his 2nd Birthday. We skipped the rocking stage and built it so we can push him around. That same day we removed the pushing handle and he was off! He prefers to ride this toy rather than riding his bicycle and he literally takes this bike everywhere he goes. Best present he ever received. I have already purchased 2 of this item as gifts as well.
2,"Rock, Roll and Ride Delux","We bought the Fisher Price Rock, Roll and Ride Delux for my son shortly after his first birthday. He has only used the toy indoors in the rock mode, being that it was winter when we purchased it. We bought the Delux model because my son loves lights and sounds. Immediately when we bought it we noticed that the lights and sounds options did not function in the rock mode like they were intended to. The lights are supposed to go off when your child rocks it. I even got on it (I weigh 100 lbs) and rocked and couldnt get the lights to come on. There are little buttons in the steering column that seem to control lights and sound function that arent working properly. We are a bit disappointed seeing how we bought the delux version for the lights and sounds which dont function well."
4,You get two toys in one,This toy is great. It grows with the child. I say you get your money's worth with this one.
2,about suprise,iam a very big fan of fifteen but i would have to say that i was let down when i heard suprise.its just not a very good album.but it still has some good songs like MY FREIND 2 and also THE END 2.
3,Inaccurate in parts,"I actually like the format and flow of the book. My problem with it has to do with the fact that it misrepresents Arminianism. Arminianism and semi-pelagianism are not the same. Arminius affirmed total depravity and the bondage of the will. Arminius believed that divine grace is needed before one can have faith. Arminius also held to penal-substitutionary atonement, not governmental like the book presents. Later followers of Arminius did espouse these heretical views but that is not Arminianism.Even if you do not agree with Arminianism, it is important to know accurately what they believe. everything else is pretty good, but for an understanding of Arminianism, look elsewhere."
3,A rather good book,"A very thought out methodology of theology. It is written on an understandable level although one might keep a dictionary handy. As a pentecostal there are times I disagree with him, however I am sure that he disagrees with me. Over all a good book."
3,This book is ok,"This is good theology book but not great. It is somewhat well written. It is easy to read. I would recomment ""Bible Doctrine"" by Grudem over this book. Both cover about the same material. I found that Enns does not hold as close to the bible as he should and tends not to tell both sides very well."
4,Very Informative:,"This is a wonderful book for those, like me, who are intersted in Theology and it's study. This may be a good book for a beginning student or even a seasoned theologian to use. It is biased, of course towards the theology of the author. This is clearly shown as he summarizes each chapter at the end and gives ""low numbers"" to what he disagrees with and ""great numbers"" to that which he agrees with.A very good book, though."
3,A Solid Summary of Theological Issues,This revised edition gives solid summaries on the themes of systematic theology.A good investment.
5,Should Be Much More remembered Today Than He Is,"I think the title of my review says it all! He & Eunice were the most happily married (doesn't say much) of all the Kennedy women because he was a faithful husband, loving father & truly devoted to public service & not selfish political ambitions. Shriver's parents were the founders of Commonweal, A ""liberal"" Catholic publication that did not go along with total ""papal infallibility"" but encouraged free thought & inclusiveness. This, no doubt was a great influence on his life. He actually set aside so many of his own political ambitions for the greater good (meaning the male Kennedys). It is sad that today so few people even know all his good work or even who he was.."
5,Inspiring,"I truly admire this man, who put his faith not in politics, but in being humane and doing the next right thing."
4,Wonderful book about an extraordinary man!,"Wonderful book about an extraordinary man. It's especially timely reading, in our current political climate, to see the grace, vision & diplomacy that marked Sarge's life."
5,"Very readable (and inspiring, too)","I found this book to be a fascinating way to look at 20th century American history through the prism of a very inspiring man's life. It was also pretty interesting to get the inside scoop on some of the personalities and behind-the-scenes maneuverings that shaped major events in our nation's history. What was maybe most interesting to me, though, was the thoughtful way the book explored what it was like for Shriver being sort-of-but-not-quite a Kennedy. Both the book and Shriver himself are inspiring. It seems like they don't make people like him anymore!"
5,A Landmark Album----The Eurythmics Best,"This was one of the best albums of 1985 and it is the Eurythmics best. It was a landmark album for them. The Eurythmics went from a very good new wave band to a major force in music.All of the songs are excellent and inventive. The use of guest singers Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello adds depth to the songs. Although the Eurythmics were toying with mixing soul and new wave and electronica on earlier albums, the blend really comes out here.This was the Eurythmics' peak. The follow up to this album (Revenge) was disappointing, but a bigger seller. The Eurythmics broke up a couple of albums later only to reform in the late 90's. They continue to make great songs and music, but none of their CD's have been as consistent as this one."
3,Eurythmics turn Rock Star,"Isn't my cup of tea. I love the first 3 Eurythmics releases. Their take with this one at being a rock band instead of a techno band leaves me cold. I give it 3 stars only for ""Would I Lie To You"". This album and ""Revenge"" sound so dated now while ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Touch"" really hold up well."
4,Good album but not their best one,"This album is good. I bought this one and Savage at the same time and first I liked this one better but after a while I changed my mind. But of course I still think this is a great album containing wonderful songs like ""There Must be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)"" (with Stevie Wonder's great harmonica solos) and ""Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves"" (featuring Aretha Franklin), for example.This is a great album and if you buy it you will not regret it. Because I cannot give it half points i give it 4 points but I would want to give it 4,5."
3,"The ""ET Mix""?","While I can't fault the original album I have to say that I am a little disappointed in the ""Would I Lie To You"" remix that is listed. Unless I am mistaken the mix that is listed as ""The ET Mix"" is not the ET mix at all but just an extended version. If you purchased this cd(As I did) to finally have a cd copy of the stellar ET mix that was only available on vinyl-look somewhere else."
5,The Last Marlin,"As an ardent sport fisherman, I did not expect to find the great read that I did when I picked up ""The Last Marlin"" in the sportfishing section of our local library. A great autobiography of Waitzkin's growing up within a rather dysfunctional family, with a sportsman's love of his favorite sport (biggame fishing) told first hand from years spent growing up in Bimini on his father's and then later his own boat. Easy read, reads like a novel. I highly recommend for both the fisherman and non-fisherman."
5,Better than described - perfect!,"This book from Goodwill located in Florida was described as in good condition. They were modest. The book is in excellent condition and the price with shipping was less than $9.00.I highly recomment you check out items from Goodwill listings online. This is the second item I have bought from Goodwill. Their prices are excellent and merchandise exceeds expectations.The book is fabulous and I am excited to have it, for use in renovating my 1930's brick Tudor home. THANKS Goodwill keep up the good work.The Well-Appointed Bath: Authentic Plans and Fixtures from the 1900's (Landmark Reprint Series)"
1,Very poorly made!,"I received this as a baby gift (not put together yet). I'm sure if the person giving the gift had put it together beforehand and realized it was junk, they wouldn't have given it as a gift. This bassinet is very poorly constructed. DO NOT BUY."
2,Pye Hastings sells out,"UGGGH! I bought this on vinyl when it was initially released. After I spun it for the third and final time, I sadly sold it to a used record store. Producer David Hitchcock left before this one and Tony Visconti took over, transforming Caravan into an incredibly mediocre pop band. This album makes you wonder if the great tunes Pye Hastings wrote before this aberation (""Memory Lain, Hugh,"" ""Love To Love You,"" ""The Dog, The Dog..."") was just a fluke. Trust me, after you play this one, you'll be running back as fast as possible to your IN THE LAND OF GREY AND PINK album and wonder how the group that recorded BETTER BY FAR can actually call themselves ""Caravan."" Raised a star because I have a soft spot for this band and can't convince myself they can actually record anything worthy of just one star."
4,"Colourbox, finally!","When I was taking classes in London (1985), one of the albums being listened to in the dorms was this one -- the torch track ""The Moon is Blue"" was the theme music for many a fling and failed romance among the first year students at Westfield College. Back in the states, I periodically tried to find it on CD, usually missing my chance when it did appear on rare listings. Now it's back and I'm grabbing it! Who says ""you can't find your blue moon.."" again? -- RhB"
5,This book made me chrish my childhood memories,This book is beautiful. The illustrations are beautiful. I read this with my child and as I read I thought of my own mother and grandmother. The text is poetic and beautiful. This book is a keepsake to be passed down from generation to generation. I am looking forward to seeing more thing from this author. I am giving this book as gifts to all my friends.
3,Seam tearing after one month,"On the plus side, they look great and feel great....However, I'm returning these today. I've had them for a month and a week and the leather on the end of the seam above the heal is beginning to tear.Bummer."
5,Love Clarks' Botts,"Great boot/shoe for most any occasion be it sport suit or an outdoor hike. They are instantly comfortable and last a long time while retaining their good looks, just like me! Really, Clarks are the only shoe I buy for great looks and long lasting ruggedness."
5,"Good material,no perfect fit","The boots are great,good materials,look nice but I'm order a 11.5 number and this are not my size,big mistake!!!! I'm 11...Well, however great pair of shoes... :)"
2,Fall apart,"I love this design of shoe, and the clarks Roar look really good. I got through two pairs in the space of 8 months. the first pair came apart at the heel (inside) but i thought it must just be a duff pair, so i got a second lot and after just two months, the sole started coming away from the shoe! i had to glue it back together which is not something i want to be doing when i spend $$s on a pair of shoes.they look good, but are made very poorly."
4,Very nice boot - but beware of width,"I really like these boots. They're comfortable, stylish and rugged enough to be used in a variety of conditions. Also, a nice benefit is that they're suprisingly lightweight. My one complaint is that they're a little too wide for my foot. I have a standard width foot (I think!) and these boots are definitely wider than I'd like them to be. If I were to order them again, I'd opt for a narrower width instead of the standard (""M"") width. Overall a good boot at a decent price."
1,CHECK THE EXP DATE!!!,I JUST REC'D THE CHICKEN ONE TODAY 8/2/12 I ALWAYS ALWAYS CK THE DATES OF EVERYTHING I EAT OR DRINK..FOR MY FURBABIES TOO.. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE..ONE..TIME I DIDN'T (THANK GOODNESS ONLY GAVE ONE TREAT EACH TO EACH DOG) I COULDN;T BELIEVE IT THE DATE SAID ..BEST..USED//BY 7/13/12!!!!

GRRRHOWEVER THE CO IMMEDIATELY REFUNDED ME...BUT..IM OUT TREATS FOR MY GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER KIND OF TREAT TO ARRIVE NOW!!I WOULD REFRAIN ORDERING FROM THIS CO.
5,"Like these so much, we bought 'em in bulk","These ""itty bitty"" treats are hard to find at the ""regular"" stores like Target or etc. So we bought the ""bulk"" size to stock up for our dogs. They love these treats."
2,"less than I expected, but okay as a non-game-specific source","I had high hopes for this book, but was a little disappointed. I bought conspiracy x, expecting great stuff, and it met with my expectations. Cryptozoolgy didn't. First, it's set up with information divided into two parts: the gamers information, and the GM's information. the result is that you have to look in two different areas for information on different ""supernatural creatures"". Most of the regular freaks of nature are covered--Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, etc. I was pleased to see a few others like the Mokole. The writing is a lot more pendantic than I'd like--but that may be a direct result from being written in character, where teh character is old, stuffy, and bombastically long-winded. If your game will run into a supernatural creature, it might be worth checking this beek out. If not, I wouldn't bother."
5,an excellent SAS intro,"One of the most heavily used reference books in my office...this is very well written for a programming book. The authors use case examples for illustrating the different programming techniques, which makes it very easily understood by the layman. If you have a basic understanding of statistical techniques such as ANOVAs and t-tests this book will allow you to use SAS fairly easily."
2,Too much unecessary detail about reading in data,"Theres just too much unecessary material in this book about ways to read in data etc. Its all unecessary cos like myself most professional analysts and statisticians have access to SAS enterprise guide, which is incredibly powerful and so much less time consuming. The programming language is only useful for algorithms these days, as most professionals havent got the time to be debugging code all day. The text covers nothing about cluster analysis either which is central to a lot of multi variate analysis.The mathematics and statistical detail is of far more interest and importance to us in the working environment than reading in of files."
3,Disappointed,"I am disappointed after reading this book. The coverage on statistics is overly superficial. I would be quite hesitating to call it a book on ""applied statistics"". It's probably better called ""Basic Data Analysis Using SAS"".It's a book for users with no experience of either statistics or SAS. It's clearly written. However, the style is old fashioned (the same is for SAS). In recent years, SAS has shifted its focus on so called ""enterprise solutions""; therefore the development on data management, statistics, and econometrics has lagged behind, compared to SPlus/R and other more specialized programs.Similar to most other SAS books, the authors spent a lot of time talking about SAS programming rather than the subject matters (mostly because SAS syntax is very old and different from most other programming languages). The author also spent a lot of efforts talking about data input assuming users are still living in a stone age and have to deal with punched cards instead of delimited data."
4,generally useful,"this book is good for an overview of the software, but does not reveal some of the detailed ways it can be used"
3,useful text,"I found this tex to be quite useful. It is however, difficult to read in parts and could be somewhat mind bending if read when not fully alert and awake."
2,Blergh,"I did not like this book. The organization was abysmal, and I decided to sell it back to the college bookstore for use by future hapless students, because it is not good as a reference guide.I did not like how the author seemed to gear the book to an audience that is terrified of their computers or anything dealing with *gasp* math."
5,Good book!,"If you don't have the background of SAS programming. You should read this book. If you have the background of C/C++ and SQL, you will find SAS is very easy to learn.I spend less time learning SAS concepts when I read this book. In part 1, the author reviews the basic concepts of statistics when running sas. This is very easy to understand!In part 2, he mentions how to infile the large data in the sas environment. You don't have to type all the data in the sas enviroment in the beginning. It is very useful.I think this is a good book for beginners who want to know what SAS programming is. I hope the author still can write the book about advanced SAS programming ."
4,Great reference for SAS beginner,"This is a great book for people just starting to work with SAS or people who haven't done SAS in a while. It covers many basic analyses (maybe up to the second basic stats class in graduate school). The only bad thing about this text is that it doesn't cover enough of the multivariate techniques. Nonetheless, great step-by-step how-to for beginners. I highly recommend this text as an introduction or a refresher!"
3,A book for beginners,"I just finished reading the third edition of this book and found something wrong on page 82, page 118, page150, page 165, and page 168. Hope they are corrected on the fourth edition."
5,The best work often is done in simple ways,"Many, if not all Microsoft Windows user, are familiar with so-called defragmentation of hard drive.This Applied Statistics and SAS programming book by Ron is just such a defragmentator for a heavy SAS user like myself.I don't think anyone can find many tips, tricks or shortcuts in this book in terms of learning statistics and SAS. In practice, more often than not, I have to do ""whatever is necessary"" with SAS to get my analytical assignment done. Over time my touch upon SAS becomes ""fragmented"". No matter how well I organize notes and template, my statistical thought with SAS becomes muddy. This book has repeatedly set me back straight.I have read many SAS books by so-called pros. This is one of the few that has elegant verse and still makes technical points in simply ways. I don't often see a technical book having a dictionary quality like this one."
5,History Alive,"Terry C. Johnston makes history live. I discovered him several years ago while looking for something western to read. Having read many of Loius L'Amour's stories I happened upon T. C. J's trilogy about the life and times of Titus Bass. (Now at least five books.) I then started reading the 'Plainsmen series' of which 'The Stalkers' is book Three. The absolute finest historical fiction I've ever read. His stories are based on carefully researched history. Because he has such a unique story teller's ability bringing the reader 'in', sometimes I think I can smell the black powder and hear the arrows singing overhead. I buy em' as soon as he writes em'."

3,Health Questionss Answered Naturally,"While most probably the book was in good to excellent condition before being shipped, packaging split and book was received in damaged condition. This book was shipped from UK to US (which I didn't realize at time of order) and the great distance most likely accounts for encountered problems. I would use them again, but I would contact them first to be certain product was appropriately packaged.Darwinism and the Rise of Degenerate ScienceLearn the Bible in 24 HoursRevelation Expounded or Eternal Mysteries Simplified: One Hundred Ten Prophetic Future Wonders from 1950 into Eternity8Sound the Trumpets"
2,Not all the author claims it to be.,"I saw Maureen on television claiming that the information in her book addressed every ailment known to man and how to cure it. Her book most certainly does not live up to her claim. Some of the information in her book is very good and not common knowledge. In each chapter, she mentions taking certain supplements. However, at the end of the chapter where there is a list of supplements to take, most of the time she doesn't include the ones that she wrote about -- leaving one to wonder about the dosage. In addition, the book repeats itself several times in different chapters. The book is not the answer to curing all diseases, as she claims, but rather an introduction to addressing many human ailments."

These are great adventure cartoons, don't let PC BS keep you from buying these!!"
2,the original,"The WB is a little late on this one. the only advantqe to getting this DVD is the extras at the end. If you have a copy of The Complete Doamond Aniversary Edition Superman Collection, you already have all of the Fleischer cartoons."
5,Is it worth the upgrade?,"I've owned the diamond anniversary collection for seveal years and have watched it at least a half a dozen times. I was quite happy with it. Sure, I'm a perfectionist and I want all of my audio and video products to be of the highest quality. After watching this latest release from Warner Bros. I honestly thought I was watching entirely new episodes of this animated series at some moments, it's that good. Yes, there's still an occasional few frames of print damage in some of the episodes and speckling through out but this is such an improvement over previous releases that it's well worth the cost for the enjoyment you'll get from it. To be honest, if they were to take and fully restore this one frame at a time and release it again a few years down the road I don't think I'd bother replacing this copy."
5,Powerful; excellent for meditation,"Petkus combines musical talent and training with a deep, intuitive understanding of the power of sound to relax, to heal, and to help the listener slip into meditation. Very beautiful CD. The liner notes offer an excellent introduction to the science of Ayurveda."
1,Warning!!,"I just received these filters and THEY ARE NOT HONEYWELL HEPA. As a result, I am now returning them and will have to incur a shipping cost. The filters are not as depicted in the picture, instead they are BestAir that fit into the Honeywell air cleaners models 16060. If you turn the filter, they don't even look the same as the honeywell filters. Also, nowhere on the box does it mention that they are Hepa. This is very disappointing as I have never had to return anything purchased through Amazon before."
2,Not Honeywell Brand,"I was disappointed in the fact that the brand I received was not Honeywell at all. I wish the picture that they used what the actual product that I was going to get. The filters that I did received were Best Air brand. They are o.k., but not as good as Honeywell Brand."
1,Just can't get it right,Twice this company shipped me the wrong filters. They show a picture of a Honeywell replacement filter then send a non-brand piece of garbage that doesn't even fit in the machine properly.Don't waste your time.
1,False Advertising,"This company is a hoax. They advertise & show a picture of a Hepa filter for Honeywell. I was mailed a cheaper filter by BestAir, not a Hepa filter, and the WRONG model number. The advertisement mentions the model number I needed, but they mail a completely different filter that's the wrong company, not a Hepa filter, and the wrong model number."
3,ok product for the price,"good price on replacement, hard to find filters. Shipped quickly,in fact came earlier than was expected.Product as stated. Would purchase again."
5,fambe zvanaka,"It is about 20 years now since Mapfumo released Shumba as an apology to his people for ostensibly collaborating with the Smith-Muzorewa attempt to hood-wink Zimbabweans into ending their struggle for freedom. As an introduction to Zimbabwean rhythms it is a must for any westerner wishing to understand the adaptation of the mbira sound to a wider audience. Incorporating infinite melodic variations around a central theme (if you listen, you will hear the Irish in it) and those tantalising African rhythms you will have to go a long way to find a better initiation into the spirit."

5,Good Stuff !!!,I had been using another brand of gel for quite a while. This is as good if not better than what I was previously using. I like buying them in bulk packs also !!!
2,I was a little disappointed with this product. ...,"I was a little disappointed with this product. My skin is pretty sensitive, and this gel tends to be a little harsh when using it to shave your legs. I'd consider using it more if I ran out of my usual choice in shaving creams, but I don't think so otherwise."
4,I really liked the conditioning ability of the ...,"I really liked the conditioning ability of the shaving gel. It made for a smooth close shave with less chance of cutting myself. However, I found the scent to be overwhelming and obnoxious. I prefer a lighter scent or no scent at all. All in all, I'd recommend this product for those of us with hard-to-shave skin who enjoy more strongly scented products."
5,It's very light shave gel that didn't clog ...,"It's very light shave gel that didn't clog up my razor and had a fresh-smelling lather that was easy to spread on my skin. For the men out there who shave their heads like me, this is one of the best -- it made the stubble very soft and easy to shave. My head was easy to rinse off and left no sticky residue like most heavy shave creams or gels. This bald guy gives this product a perfect rating!"
4,The Audubon Engagement Calandar is naturally beautiful.,"The Audubon Engagement Calendar 2003 has 60 beautiful, natural photographs to see along with a detailed description and location. It is also noted in detail how each photo was shot professionally. This booklet contains a full page calendar for 2002, 2003 and 2004 and, of course, each page thereafter is each week of 2003 from Monday to Sunday (Dec. 30, 2002-Jan. 4, 2004). There is plenty of space to write birthdays, anniversaries and your own personal notes. Included are the holidays, International and Jewish holidays, moon phases and time change for April and October. There are other extras including how to order your Audubon Engagement Calendar for 2004, but I would recommend ordering your calendars from Amazon.com every year."
1,Error in top-rated review,"Beware the top-rated review! It is reviewing a different clock! It states that the hours and minutes can be set with buttons that move the time up and down. Instead, this clock requires you to go through 23 hours if you accidentally overshoot by one. Worse, if you overshoot the year by one, you have to go through 99 years to get to the correct one.The clock is also essentially unusable by anyone over 40. Reading glasses will allow you to read the alarm-time digits, but you will not be able to see the alarm-time PM indicator.Timex, a few years ago, did sell a clock that had the interface described in the top-rated review, with up and down keys and 15-minute fast advance. Why they went back to an interface found wanting in the 1960s is beyond me..."
5,excellent nap feature,"love this travel alarm with nap feature. I have been purchasing this feature 3 times since 1996. I use it for napping of course, as well as a timer for kids programs, doing housework, and even baking. It is my main alarm clock in the house and camper."
2,Stupid thing has no snooze for the nap timer,"The snooze bar doesn't work with the nap timer. Otherwise, this is just an average piece of junk alarm clock."
4,Short snooze timer makes it bad for those who are not ready to wake yet.,"Otherwise, this alarm clock is very good. It has a light which is turned on by pressing the snooze button when the alarm is not going off. It has a date setting, but I don't use it. One thing that cost me a tardy at school was the fact that it's hard to tell whether it is set to AM or PM. To solve this, pay careful attention or set it to 24 hour."
4,could use some refinement.,"I have had it for a month and use it daily as an alarm clock and occasionally for a nap timer. Keeps perfect time as far as I can tell. Things I wish it had: 1. Graduated alarm volume...start off low, then grow louder if not snoozed or shut off. 2. Larger/smoother alarm turn off switch. 3. No beep sound when you hit the snooze button to see what time it is at night. 4. Ability to operate snooze button when unit is closed."
2,Gains time..And Display isnt very clear,Bought this despite mixed reviews from previous customers. As mentioned by others it gains approximately 3-4 min in a week. Also the Indiglo display isnt that great. It is very hard to see the time display during the day. Bottomline.. Always look through customer reviews and think hard and long if a product you are considering buying has bad reviews.Update: Display is all messed up after just one battery change. Stay away from this product
1,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality","This Elgin remake of the original Timex 3400T is nothing like the original. (I like the original so much I was hoping to buy another.) Sadly, the quality of this clock is very, very poor. This new design of the 3400T is completely different (worse) -- they should have changed the part number.I liked the ability to quickly and quietly set a ""nap"" time in the original. No more! The updated version is much more difficult to set and it beeps loudly every time you press a button.I am very disappointed. I'd gladly pay three times the price to get a 3400T of the original Timex design."
4,The good outnumbers the bad,"Pros:- Reasonable alarm sound (for light-medium sleepers)- Compact and extremely portable- Lightweight yet sturdy; size that fits the falm of your hands, yet has a foldable stand- Good led light, clear indications of the size of each button- Affordable and matching with many types of furniture, color, etcCons:- Not user friendly- Adjusting time, alarm, difficult due to the one direction limit digits go only higher till 59 and resets to 0 )"
1,Bad Alarm Clock,"I bought this to replace my 10-year old Casio travel alarm. The ""nap timer"" feature looked useful. Unfortunatley the alarm in this thing is very soft, no louder than the alarm on my wristwatch. I can't use it, I sleep through it every time. NOT recommended."
2,Nap timer isn't loud enough,"I bought a couple of these because of the nap timer feature. One I intended to use as a travel alarm (and nap timer), the other exclusively as a nap timer. Unfortunately, the nap timer just isn't loud enough. I know I need to get more sleep (so that I don't need a really loud nap timer), but this doesn't work for me, and I ended up tossing both of them. Like others, I also wasn't thrilled about being able to set the clock in only one direction."
5,Christine's Review,I was pleased the order arrived within three days of ordering. I am happy to have found a source for this Lipgloss.
5,Religious Romp,"Lyndal Roper's work ""Oedipus and the Devil"" explores different case studies of witches and their witchcraft in Northern Europe during the sixteenth century. It is also a masterful study of the competing Catholic and Protestant views and teachings with regards to the mores and cultural attributes of that time period. This was a time when Europe was exploding in Reformation and Counter-Reformation and hysteria over witchcraft was at its highest. Roper's most controversial assertion is that our modern, Freudian understanding and construct of the Oedipus Complex has no bearing or relationship to that of other time periods and cultures. This would seem to complicate contemporary attempts by such philosophers as Jurgen Habermas to reconstruct historical materialism by examining the family and the dynamics of their relationships, psycho-sexual or otherwise. A must read for anyone wishing to understand history and how religion and psychology affect its formation and outcome."
5,great job!!,"This was a real treat for me because I had missed so many contests when I left Europe back in the 80's. The picture quality is good and I think they chose some great songs and performances. I wish the DVD has some special features and they do chop off each song a little abruptly , but for the most part I really love the DVD.This is great value for the money, especially if you like catchy ,fun music. I am very happy."
4,Science Fair 1st Place,The hybrid vehicle was the topic for my daughter Gabrielle's Science Project. She was easily able to build the house and the project with very little help from me. With a little coaching on the project and a little direction she successfully won a 1st Place in her fourth grade Science Fair.
2,This is very poorly done.,"This story is long and boring and totally turned off my children and their friends. We got through a little bit of it and now I am labeled as the ""boring dad."" I am a Wind Power major and I expected significantly more out of this. The workmanship was poor and the styrofoam parts never fit right. Great idea but very poorly executed."
1,Don't Read,This book is another one of those someone else is in control of you books. If you are forced to read it I have mercy on your soul because you will die the same fate I did. Spend your time doing better things go see Titan A.E.
2,Three plays by Thornton Wilder,"When I received this collection of plays by Thornton Wilder, I compared some of the text to an original acting script, and found that several changes had been made, apparently to make it more socially ""correct"". For example, in the introductory monolog to Our Town, the playwright's reference to the people living in Polish Town as ""foreigners who come to work in the mill"" had been completely deleted. I consider this an example of Bowdlerizing, and a big enough change in the text that it may be illegal. I was very disappointed."
4,Worked out for us,"These proved useful for our film's costuming needs. They are probably mens' size (this descrition would be helpful), but otherwise are a good costume accessory, whether for a film or a play or just a general costume occasion. The price was decent and the delivery was fast."
4,yaaa boots,"I love these boot covers, once on they look just like real boots and they are not uncomfortable!!"
2,Boot Tops,"I got these for my husband for a ren fair. The first time he put them on his shoes, the elastic band that goes around the bottom of the shoe ripped right off. After fixing this and wearing them to the fair we had a hard time getting them to stay up around his calves. With alot of adjustments they are fine now, but I would advise just spending the extra bucks to get real boots."
4,Great Value,Purchased these to complete a pirate costume for a ballroom dance party. They look great going over a pair of standard black dance shoes. They are much better quality then I was expecting for the price.
2,Deluxe adult vinyl boot tops,"I purchase the deluxe adult vinyl boot tops to complete my halloween costume. The boot tops were constructed well but apparently made to fit a large man. The boot tops will not stay up on my legs and I'm a tall girl with med-large calves. I'm going to try a circle of elastic to hold them up. I would stitch them up, but from past experience trying to sew on vinyl, it will only cut the vinyl.My suggestion to the vendor would be to offer the boot tops in sizes - small, med, & lg."
3,looks real but doesn't stay up good,"I like the way these look, but they do not stay up very good. I had to stop and retie them several times."
3,Sweet Accesorie,"These are pretty awesome. My only problem is that they are difficult to get around shoes, but they fall down...a lot. So if you don't mind pulling them up a lot or taking extra time with the shoes, they're great."
3,"Good quality, odd fit","Received the product quickly and was very pleased with the quality. Odd fit though. Not wide enough to slip on over your shoes, but wide enough to keep falling down during the night. Had to tie a shoelace around the top to keep them up. Also, two elastic straps on the bottom that are too tight to go over the shoes. One of them snapped while trying to pull it over the toe of my shoe since you have to put these on first, and then your shoes. Overall I'm pleased but a few minor quirks."
5,"Great ""fake"" boots!","these shoe covers make men's black shoes look like 18th century boots... and they work. we had to do some ""minor surgery"" and remove the stirrup strap in order for them to go over the shoes. they looked great!"
1,not worth the effort,"The boot tops look great in the pictures, and the idea is a good one, but they simply never stop falling down. The effect is ruined when your flimsy ""boots"" are always dragging down to your ankles."
3,Boot Covers,"These are Ok boot covers, but the look is much better, if you are wearing real boots.They will do in a pinch."
2,Eh,"They looked great but they were too big at the top and kept falling down. Definitely not meant for women. Also, the foot straps broke at the first sign of stretch. They did the job but only so~so."
4,Just add safety pins,"Pros: Surprisingly realistic for the price. Even the brass-like ""rivets"" on the side look slightly tarnished as if from use.Cons: As other commenters have pointed out, the elastic foot straps are not long enough to fit over most shoes; most of mine broke away from the boot cover. Also, the boots don't hug your legs very tightly (and would probably be uncomfortable if they did) so they have a tendency to droop. No worries though, a few safety pins fix both issues!"
2,Too small,Stay away from these if you're a larger guy. I'm about 300lbs and 6ft and these would not over my calves. Just too tight.
2,good,when i first bought the book writing clearly i thought it wont be in good conditions. because it was a used one so i was not excepted a used book in good conditions like this one.
4,Helping,"This book is far superior to Doggett's ""Growing up in Public"". I recently read them both. Just wanted to help out if anyone was deciding between the two."
5,great book,"great inside in who is lou reed, the hard copy is a great product and not very expensive, is a really joy to read the book , it starts from lou child hood to almos 2005 i think"
3,***hole: The Lou Reed Story,"Seriously. Reed sounds like a nasty, destructive, poor excuse for a human being. At least in this biography. Thank god I haven't met him in person."
2,Does Bockris hates Lou?,"When I finished ""Transformer"", it leaves me a bad taste that Bockris was kinda foe of Reed, that he really hates him. The book tries to glance Reed from the outside, not getting very involved in nothing, but describing coldly all the bad things that Reed has done. If you dont know anything about Reed music, this book is very boring. If you have enjoyed his work, this books dissapoint you, gives you the impression that Lou is just an asshole with nothing to do but drink or snort drugs. Bockris avoid every sensibility that Lou may put in every one of his albums, just making poor critics of the technical aspects or what the press said. Unfortunately, this is maybe the only biography of Reed, or at least the most complet. So if want to know more about this great poet and composer, you must read this, although it has a great lack of passion and compassion for Lou."
1,LOW capacity,"I had read the reviews and just hoped I didn't get a duff one like some of the others. Guess what? I got one that will hold a charge for 24 hours, unlike the factory original that works for 3 or 4 days! Don't buy this one. Get the all white one. Having said that some have complained about that one too...maybe you just have to keep buying until you hit a good one. No doubt for the price of the ""real"" one you can afford to try a couple of times! Good Luck."
2,Disappointed,I bought two of the Island Planters listed as 16 in. The diameter of the container is actually much smaller...more like 12 inches. The size as listed is very misleading.[...]
3,Just ok,"It's just your average shampoo. I didn't find this shampoo particularly moisturizing, but it did what it was supposed to do, clean my hair."
4,Basic,"It is ok shampoo, but a great value for the price. I recommend it for people who are on a budget."
4,Good for the price when on sale.,"I purchased several bottles of Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo when Amazon had it on sale for $1.24. At that price, it was a real bargain. It is a decent shampoo, that didn't dry out or leave my ""normal"" hair greasy. The shampoo is a poor man's Nexxus or Paul Mitchell formula. Having used both of those over the years, the Suave version isn't as good. If you have dry or damaged hair, you may want to look elsewhere. Also, the current Amazon price is $5.99. There is no way I'd pay this for a Suave product. If you can get it on sale, and have ""normal"" hair though, I can recommend Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo."
5,Silky smooth,"I am a guy, I generally don't bother with conditioner. So I really like how this shampoo leave my hair feeling amazingly smooth and clean. I have a ""fade"" haircut, so the results may be different for people with longer hair."
3,A good shampoo for the price,* The shampoo works fine and I did like it better than the Almond and Shea Shampoo.* A great find for the price.
1,Do not buy this from amazon,"I paid $ 5.99 for 12.6 fl oz of this product. After I ordered, I later realized that Walmart sells 32 Fl Oz of it at $ 2.74. It turns out that, I paid more than 2 times for a product which was less than half in volume. I did not expect this from an order fulfilled by amazon. I wished I could return but will cost me more than $4 for shipping as amazon will not consider this my fault."
1,Misleading,"The picture of the item shows 3 bottles, however it is really only one. It is the smaller 12.6 oz bottle. not the larger 32 oz bottle that is often sold in stores. Also, the price for one smaller bottle was $5.99, far more expensive than available in any store. Priced yesterday at Walgreens for $1.99. Picture is completely misleading."
5,Political wheeling and dealing,"I read Primary Colors a few years ago and enjoyed it tremendously.Sharp, keenly observed political games and recognisable characters if you want to transpose them for their real-life alternatives.I loved it."
2,review of revlon flex shampoo,"Flex Shampoo, Frequent Use with Balsam and Protein - 15 fl ozit was obvious that when rcvd the product was tainted ( black in color VS GOLDEN GLOW)Most importantly i returned product & vendor CUTIE BEAUTY promptly returned all costs including my shipping cost to return to them It was done Courtiously & prompty Although i was diasppointed with condition of product,the rest of the experience wsa just fine ALAN J FRIEDMAN"
1,IF I COULD GIVE NO STARS I WOULD,"This record is awful. It's self indulgent, with lyrics akin to a 9th Graders poetry. This is an album made by people TRYING to be something other than what they are. They went from a mediocre indy rock band to [bad] 70's ...band. ""Sweet Marie"" is decent (though the video is terrible, almost as bad as their message board), but from there on out, it's a disaster. When did Justin get a [faux] English accent? ""There's a hoewell where ya haaht should be""...???? They need to get back on the Get Up Kids coattails because otherwise, this band is going to continue to spiral downward even faster. I expect more from a Vagrant band."
1,so very disappointing,"I was really let down with this one. There are three songs that rate an 'okay' at best. The rest are over-produced, badly written efforts. Of course it's hard to follow up to the energy and sincerity of their first release, but there's no excuse for this mess. Don't buy it. Poor!"
3,"Fun, but seems a bit caricatured","This album is quite a departure from 'Designing a Nervous Breakdown,' favoring a '60s/'70s-ish classic rock sound. The songwriting is great, and their expertly layered arrangements really make the most of the voices and instruments within the band, and suit the songs well.The one fault I find with this record is how overly stylized the overall sound is: it almost seems like the Anniversary have fit their music into a preconceived genre-caricature [British Beatles/T.Rex/60s/70s influenced rock]. Although the album cover is an attractive design, it looks like an on-purpose ripoff of 'Revolver.' Maybe it was meant to be cheeky and ironic, but in my opinion it illustrates a tendency on this record to mimic certain influences to an extent that obscures the Anniversary's own musical/sonic identity.This is still a fun, enjoyable, passionate record, and deserves recognition as such."
2,only two good songs,"i was pretty excited when i heard that the anniversary was putting out this album...for those of you who have heard the first album 'designing a nervous breakdown,' you probably agree that it is one of the finest synth driven rock and roll cd ever put out...the first two songs on the cd are pretty good...although they are much different from 'designing...' the cd goes absolutly no where after sweet marie and crooked crown...every song sounds the same...the live show went down with this album also...i guess they left vagrant records for bigger and better things...i'm glad vagrant ridded themselves of this band...thats all"
2,"If you like pop music, this album's for you.","I was very disappointed with Anniversary's follow-up to Designing a Nervous Breakdown. They are an incredibly talented band that is capable of creating much more innovative music, but this album is a step in the wrong direction. Yes, there are some good points on the album, but in my opinion there are no stand out tracks, none of the songs do the band justice. Maybe I am a bit biased for the sheer fact that I believe D.A.N.B. is a musical masterpiece. Even the lyrics on the new album seem a bit drab. The Anniversary are still a relatively young band, and after this album, there is much room for improvement."
1,The worse sophmore effort in music history YOU CAN QUOTE ME,"I hate this cd with every passion that my heart can muster. This makes me so angry that when ever I read a good review for this album I wanna scream. This is such a posuer, faksta record that I could just keel over a die in shame that somebody could muster such a stupid record. After record the super catchy and good first album DANBD, they decided that they would act more ""mature"" and make boring rock music. This is an example of a band trying to play to the critics and nay-sayers, they only did this record becuase people said they sounded too much like the get up kids. That is pitiful and pathetic, they are faking the funk so bad that it almost bleeds out of your stereo. I can't stand this record it makes me so mad!"
5,Sweet Pop Music,"The Anniversary have created another fantastic pop album with their sophomore release. Once again you'll find rich harmonies, strong songwriting and great licks in every song.If you're addicted to wonderful pop/rock music that you can't get from mainstream American radio(Teenage Fanclub, GBV, Superchunk, Modest Mouse, etc.), then you're gonna thank me for recommending this gem."
4,"Taste is fabulous, amount you get not so much","The taste of this coffee candy is terrific - not too sweet, not too strong, just perfect.The amount you get in this $5+ package is 32 candies. Each candy is the size of 3 nickels stacked on top of each other. Total weight of all candies in this package is 4.23 oz (120 grams).The taste met my expectation, the amount of candies I received did not.Update: Kopiko candy inspired me to investigate other Asian Coffee Candies. If you like Kopiko I recommend that you also tryBali's Best Coffee Candy, 5.3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12).Bali's Best has a slight stronger coffee taste compared to Kopiko Cappuccino flavor, and just slightly sweeter. Both are fine candy, but Bali's Best is a much better deal. See my review of Bali's Best Coffee Candy for details."
3,So-So,"I am a coffee drinker but, these didn't do it for me. I don't know....I think I was expecting a creamier taste where these seemed to have a taste that was almost like black coffee. Just not my thing."
5,"A beautiful, beautiful book","I recommend this book highly to anyone, especially if you are struggling with things you cannot change or having difficulty discerning what you can and cannot change. This book gave me what I had expected to get from ""The Purpose Driven Life"" but did not find."
3,Primordial Special Investigations Agency,"This book was a good read and the story line was relatiively believable. It was interestingly set in 3 locations. The description of some of the scenes were very explosive and had me reaching for my husband!! I liked the strong independent woman who was game for anything to save her granfather, I felt the lead male role was slightly over matcho, but could imagine they are out there.I may try another of Ms Agnews books, just to see if I like her continued style, this was my first book by her and I felt I have read better.Truth be told I would still read it, so give it a go as there are great scenes, maybe just not enough!!"
3,An Average Book,"I bought this book for Sun Certification. It looks and feel good but the content is a little too brief. It is a bit expensive. Doesn't cover Part II. I notice there a lot of print error. Reader need to be careful when reading the book. The way it is structure is quite confusing, it try to reduce the pages so it combine those options together. But overall, it is average, if reader have hands-on Sun SysAdmin experience and should be able to spot the print errors. But be careful when reading it. Also there is no practice exam question for whole test. Every chapter have only 10 multiple choices and 2 free answer question. Some of the objectives are briefly indicated. I pass by reading this book alone and with 2yrs of hand-ons experience."
5,Outstanding & Best of Its Kind,"Incomparable! With his first book, Charles Chicarelli introduces the life story and teachings of Sakyamuni Buddha as depicted in paintings, sculptures and other works of art found in a dozen Asian countries. Lavishly illustrated with more than 175 exquisite color photographs from temples, museums, historical sites and private collections, this invaluable book ranks first in terms of illustrated guides to Buddhist Art. Extensively researched over more than thirty years while the author resided in Asia, it is well suited everyone: college students, armchair travelers backpackers and academics. Not a coffee table book, it fits perfectly into a backpack. It contains an extensive Glossary, Bibliography, Notes, Index and two Appendices plus a fine map of Buddhist Sites in Asia. Read this book and see for yourself. You won't be sorry."
3,"Good overview, but don't buy for the photos","I purchased this without having looked at it first, and while it does seem to be a competent overview of the subject, I think many people might want to consider something with better quality photography. That's a big reason for buying such a book, but many photos are grainy or oversaturated. I think there are better examples of this type of book, although the price is very reasonable."
2,not sent the advertised boot!,"i next day ordered a pair of boots for my daughter who is attending a week long outdoor camp at wolf ridge in finland mn. while the kaya sorel boot is a keeper for warmth and daylong outdoor activites, it is NOT the boot as advertised in the description or photo. the collar at the top of the boot had a black faux fur collar. the boot we were sent had a plain puffy sewn collar. as i cannot return the boot for the advertised version in time for her camp experience, we will have to keep this boot, but she is sorely disappointed. every girl needs her cute factor as well as warmth!"
1,boring book for class,I had to read this for a Roman history class and the class and the book were both pretty boring. As a side note don't take any class that requires this if you don't want to be completely confused because it seems like everyone has the same name
5,very happy customer,i have absolutely loved my Fogger; got so many complements. it's so cool to watch! I would buy it again and do recommend it highly!
3,oldie but a goodie,"Another of Jack Higgins boys own adventures, set in the 70's with good old fashioned seat of your pants adventure and intregue.The good guys win again."
3,Good Story - Typical Early Jack Higgins,"This book was originally published under another Jack Higgins pseudonymn James Graham.It was published prior to ""The Eagle Has Landed"" and contains many of the exciting elements(hairbreadth escapes, shootouts, etc.) found in many of Higgins early novels. The storyis very similiar to his book ""The Keys Of Hell"". However, the story is good and fast paced.Of course parts of the story are a bit hard to believe - especially some of the escape sequences.But Higgins does a good job weaving the various story elements together - making for anenjoyable read."
5,THE BEST ROCK BAND IN THE U.S.,"For those of you who still have not heard the best that rock has to offer....hellOOOO....are you paying attention???? This band has no real equal. Sure, King's X is great - but they have a propensity to produce 2-4 duds on each album and I can honestly say that after 5 lps and an ep, there are no more than a couple weak songs on all the material GALACTIC COWBOYS has put out. I have never seen another rock band in 30 years of listening that I can make that assertion about. If you don't like this album, you do not appreciate art in music. - Brad Farha"
5,This is probably the best album of the year.,"From the very start of the album until the very last note, I was just in awe of the talent conveyed through this well crafted album. The vocals, music and lyrics combine to display a tidal wave of emotion and inspiration. I LOVED THIS ALBUM!!!"
5,best album of 1998,i have not taken this cd out of my player since i got it if you like hard rock metal with clean vocal harmonies buy this album you will be a fan
4,Good test prep book!,"This book contains several tests for each subject area, with accompanying answers and explanation. The word knowledge section was very good. It tells you ways to improve your word knowledge skills and provides a list of over 1000 words that can be used to boost this skill. We (my son and I) are using this book to help him prepare for the ASVAB and have found this book to be very helpful. We are also using the ARCO book in conjunction with this, you can't over practice! This book (Barron's) is also the book used by the community college in it's six week class for ASVAB prep. We have found it to be a very useful tool!"
5,Can not live without!!!,"I LOVE this mop!!! The microfiber pad is amazing at cleaning everything. I have laminant flooring, tile, linolium, and hardwood floors and this mop has taken off crayon, black rubber marks, dried on spaghetti sauce, clumps of mud and food. All you need to do is apply a little preasure. I wet my pad down with hot tap water and wring it out well. For tough marks I let the hot pad steam the spot for a moment and wipe away. There is no better mop out there...for sanitary reasons alone, this is a must have. Wash the pad in your washing machine, dry in the dryer, and reuse over and over again."
4,Good product,"Good product but need better, more complete business plan sample for video production.By the way, do not buy the product from Amazon if you need the product right away. They use UPS that is not reliable for fast delivery."
1,business plan pro,"I too have been having problems with this program. Like state above the program would just shut down (sometimes with several error messages) but unlike stated above, this crash happens everytime I start the program up. At first it was working fine but then a week or so after installment it started shutting done for no reason and I can't get it to stay running for more then a few seconds at a time. this program has given me nothing but problems since i got it."
3,problems exporting business plan to Word,"I inserted jpg figures in my plan and then tried to export the plan to Word XP. The file was corrupt; Word could open it but could not close it; it caused Word to crash. I had to export as rtf, open the file in Word, and then save as a Word Doc. Also, when printing a business plan as a pdf, the face page, confidentiality agreement, and table of contents end up at the end of the document. The same thing happened for rtf exports. To get all the pages in the right order, you need to print from within the print preview screen."
3,Be careful with Vista,"BPP 2006 ran fine on xp for me. I transferred it to my new laptop with vista and could not run it. when I tried to start it, the message ""unexpected error, quitting"" kept coming up. I decided it wasn't ready for vista so I upgraded to 2007. Same problem. I spent a day with tech support through email trying to fix it. I ""repaired"" it through control panel, uninstalled and reinstalled, ran as an administrator, updated windows, ran spybot and ad-aware. At least four clean installs and twice I ran Palo Alto's diagnostic program.It still doesn't work. Maybe it's my machine but I don't think so - I've never had that error message before and I run everything from Word to Photoshop to Vegas 7 video editing. So - try it before you buy it."
4,Palo Alto Business Plan Pro 2007,It is an easy to use product that walks you through building a business plan. I recommend it for the new business and new to business entrepreneur.
2,Pretty buggy software on XP,"I am currently using this product to create a business plan. After using it for 2 months, suddenly it crashes whenever I touch any graph in the outline view. Tech support is mediocre at best, simply sending me longer and longer test scripts to install on my machine. I still cannot get a graph to display...BP PRO crashes every time. I would not recommend this software because I cannot keep it running!"
5,Good For Business,I have enjoyed the product for many years and as always they have created a great product and upgrade...also appreciate the added in box perks...helps with many subjects; marketing.
5,Palo Alto business plan pro 2007,This product was very instrument in helping me secure funds for a small business start up.
2,Not for me,This product could probably be good for some people. I did not find it helpful for my situation.
2,Not a CD-G Karaoke CD,"I was very excited to get this CD, but when my child put it in the player she said ""no words!"" This CD is just that.. a CD. There are no lyrics along with it for the screen. Disappointed - not what I was expecting. It seems if its listed as a Karaoke CD, it should come with the graphics."
5,excellent,I thought that this CD was absolutely excellent. I love everyone of the songs. It wasn't a CD that I just bought for 2 or three songs. The song by Garth Brooks is excellent. I recommend this CD to everyone to likes country music
5,"""Amen"" from the Chorus","I knew that this was going to be a good one as soon as I saw the authors' name on the cover (check out John T. Reed's *football* coaching books, excellent!). Based on my personal journey of 10 years coaching youth baseball, and associated 100+ books read & scores of clinics attended over that time - *this* is the best take on what constitutes effective 12 & under baseball coaching that I have seen to-date. Finally, a reasoned and thoughtful delineation of the differences between ""real"" baseball and ""youth"" baseball - and how to effectively coach to those differences. John T. Reed does it again!My plug for the best companion coaching book out there - Positive Coaching, by John Thompson (a fuller exploration of the emotional side of effective youth coaching, IMHO). Utilizing these 2 books, you have all of the tools that you need to be an effective youth coach. Go get 'em!"
1,There is better material out there,I just wanted to let readers know that there are several other books and resources out there with much better content and organization for less moneyHaving been involved with my own kids in different facets of kids baseball I am always on the lookout for new or original material. Unfortunately this very pricey book does not fill the bill.
3,A shallow survey,"This is a great book if you want to get excited about real estate investments. The first chapters give one the impression that there is minimal risk in real estate compared to a vast upside potential.The rest of the book surveys all the various kinds of real estate investments but does not cover them in depth. If you are looking for a book to help you evaluate a real estate transaction from a numbers standpoint, this book is not for you. I would turn to ""The Real Estate Game"" by Poorvu as a beginner's guide for evaluating real estate transactions."
2,nothing in this book,"I bought that book hoping to find some thing related to construction inspection. The book takes you thru a quick trip of the ideas of inspecting items.I recommended this book to my mother in law to have a general knowledge of construction, however she has nothing to do with construction.Too expensive, and in my opinion does not worth that money."
1,US G&S,"I thought that an American version of G&S favorites, especially under the direction of Mark Elder, would be an unusual delight. Wrong. The cast, orchestra, and production are so un-British that's it's really disappointing to the point of never listening again. I took a chance and lost; don't make the same mistake. Stick with one of the many D'Oyly Carte collections. Too bad."
2,Kinda boring,My kids and I tried playing this game. Kept our attention span for maybe 10 minutes. Really think it's meant for 16 and over. Not easy for younger kids.
3,Not as fun as catch phrase,"I bought this game with the hopes of adding something new to our game nights. We're all YBPs (young business professionals) just shy of the 30 year old mark and we like to get together and have some drinks and play board games once in a while. This game held our interest for about 17 minutes, but after that we soon went back to Catch Phrase. Buzz Word is challenging, but the person giving the clues can only read what is written on the card. Catch Phrase allows the person giving the clues to be creative and really come up with something unique or original to get his team to guess the answer. This is my biggest disappointment with this game, the lack of creativity afforded to the reader of the card. I'm sure we'll play this game again next time, hopefully for a little longer than 17 minutes."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,I thought some of the words that were selected were kind of silly and most people in our group could not answer the buzzword without including it in a phrase. I was expecting buzzwords that would instigate the type of clues that would make you shout out just one word answers rather than a couple of sentences
4,More fun for adults than kids,"Buzzword is fun, but our 11 and 15 year old find the questions very challenging. The adults end up answering most of the questions which makes this less of a family game."
2,Not as much fun as I expected,We tried playing this a couple of times with a group of people and it just didn't catch on. Some of the cards were pretty easy. It's one of those things where you've either heard of the phrase or you haven't.
2,Back to Catchphrase after this,"The cards limited our enjoyment of this game. You are restricted to only reading the clues on the card. The fun of games like Taboo and Catchphrase are that you can make up the clues yourself, and if someone is having trouble guessing you can taylor your clues to their personal knowlege/experience. Here, you are stuck simply reading what is on the card, and if they have no idea they are totally out of luck. This especially limited the enjoyment of the older grandparents, younger cousins, and friends for whom English is a second language, because their knowledge base was more limited/specific than what was generally provided on the cards."
3,Fun concept,Most clues are in the ball park but some are not even close....still a good time and a good party game.
5,Put on your toga and get ready to party fraternity style!!!,"This cd (and the movie it's from) bring back so many memories from my college days. Although it portrays fraternities in a negative light, a member of one cannot help enjoying this soundtrack."
2,Not FM Live,"If you are looking for another effort like ""FM Live"", don'tpurchase this. It is not a recording of an entire concert.Peter's guitar work is covered by Collin's sax, sort of.Not much on this CD to get excited about. Very disappointingCD from such a ""once was"" great band."
4,Make your own Quest!,"The Core Rules of the Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game is an OK try at turning a series of fantasy books into a game. It has the basics down - character creation, a simple system of rules, a magic system and rules of combat.But the background information is too simplistic. There is no way, if you wanted to make a whole story, that you could get enough details from the book. If you planned to make your own epic story you would need to use Tolkien's books for finding the ideas and giving you the knowledge to fill them out.Also, I think the rules about mass combat, in dealing with the major battles of Middle-Earth, also seem too simplistic. This book is great in the hands of a person who already knows how to design and run a game. But a person new to roleplaying will need more help than found in this book."
1,Baby Mama Drama-I can't belive this book!,"I am ashamed to say that I read this whole book. I kept telling myself that it would get better...it didn't. This book seemed very unorganized. I am use to a book ""flowing""...it jumped from one plot to the other. The grammar was horrible also! I honestly believe that the plot could have been great if it was well written.I believe Mr. Bailey meant well, but I will not purchase another book by him. If anything I owe him my thanks...now that I have read his book, I am encouraged to write my own book! If he could get this book published, I can definately get a book published...anyone can!!"
1,Disappointment,"First of all I give much respect to Mr. Bailey for getting a book published. But after the first chapter, I had to put the book down because I became frustrated at how the book started. It seemed to be various storylines and situations in one chapter and nothing seemed to make any sense. Maybe someone else might be able to read through the confusion and finish this book. I hope Mr. Bailey's next release is much better than this one."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This had to be a first draft and not a final copy. I can't begin to count how many grammatical errors were in the book. The story was so silly. I don't really want to give away some things that are in the book, but some of it was so ridiculous. I would not read this book and wouldn't even consider reading something else by him. Thank goodness I got it from the library!"
2,One Half of Music For Palaces,"These six tracks have been bootlegged many times, as ""Dali's Car,"" ""Music for Palaces"" (disc 1), ""Music for Fans Vol.1"" and other names. Tracks 1, 2, 5 & 6 were recorded 19 February & 26 February 1974 in BBC studio Four. Tracks 3 & 4 were recorded live at the Reading Festival (with the Winkies), 26 August 1974.The other disc of Music for Palaces (Music For Fans Vol.2) includes Seven Deadly Finns, Later On, R.A.F. and The Lion Sleeps Tonight.The tracks are all interesting from a historical perspective, but not great fidelity. Don't pay a lot of money for them -- you can always download them for free with a little work -- and that doesn't reward bootleggers."
2,Definitely a boot leg,"The sound quality is not good in alot of spots. Definitely not worth $58.99?? I got a copy at a record show for a fraction of that. Only good for the pictures on the cover of early Eno. Also, an odd quote printed on back of Captain Beefheart, why??"
3,A nice survey of financial reporting,"The book contains a number of good articles, introducing some important, basic accounting and finance concepts for non-financial managers. The chapters on Financing Operations and Growth, Budgeting, Practical Tools for Management Decisions and Valuation Concepts were the most informative and relevant. Others, like Taxation and The Time Value of MOney were too simplistic. An OK book if you have limited time to devote to the subject, but it really won't do much more than introduce you to some useful vocabulary, so you won't feel completely intimidated when dealing with your finance staff."
4,Well written and a great reference book to keep handy,A really excellent reference book to keep handy. Gives a great overview of key finance concepts and is easy to follow. It was well worth the price and the time spent reading it.
2,Not the best solution,"The book was purchased because i found it in the list of recommended reading of ISM (Institute of Supply Management), so I thought that it will be something rather thorough, complete, but not too long (not ""Corporate finances"" of Brealey/Meyers, which is great book, but was too long for me, so I read only half of it)The book was not very bad, structured, but:1. Very shallow - I expected to find more information in HBR.2. Example of balance sheet does not correspond to example of PnL (in real life and in most of the books they correspond each other)3. Several misprints (I thought HBR can afford someone who makes spellchecking)So I would advise to look for better book."
1,Finance for Managers (Harvad Business Esssentials),It wasn't all what I had expected - I thought it would have given a deeper insight also to the financing aspects.
2,"Finance Book Review - Jameson Thottam (formerly with Morgan Stanley, Homestore and IndyMac Bank)","This is an OKAY book,My name is Jameson Thottam and as an individual steeped heavily in finance (graduated from UC Berkeley and attending Wharton's MBA and focused on financial services such as such as The Loan Page, IndyMac Bank, Homestore), I would give a qualified recommend on this book to those in finance. There are other books that take provide more details on mathematical programing and simulation software (i.e., Linear programming, Monte Carlo Simulations, CRYSTAL BALL / SEC II / @RISK software packages). Additionally, if you like market insider trading (i.e., technical analysis)...you can do much better.Hope you enjoy,Jameson Luke Thottam(Job History: Battery Ventures/The Loan Page, IndyMac Bank, Homestore, Morgan Stanley Investment Banking, LEK Management Consulting)Houston, Tx"
1,DANGEROUS!!!!,"Started to assemble it, put in the batteries and within seconds smoke was coming out of the toy and the plastic was melting!!!! Put it back in the box, writting e-mail to the manufacturer."
4,"A satisfying ""first reference"" on Swedish Mausers","I purchased a pair of Swedish Mausers (thanks to Boston T. Party's high praise in ""Boston's Gun Bible"") and needed a no-nonsense reference which would tell me precisely what I needed to know to identify, disassemble, clean and make preparations for restoration, if need be. I like pithy little books--some photos, accurate line drawings, descriptive text, tables. My only disappointment was the lack of loading information--bullets, primers, powders which I might use to duplicate the military loadings. I would buy other volumes in this series."
3,When is a bear paw not?,"This book is narrowly focused on a technique for quilt-making based on variations of the popular bear's paw block. The idea grew out of teaching experiences at a quilt camp, and involves replacing the traditional center or ""paw pad"" of this block with a simple sampler block, like the nine-patch or the shoofly. The effect can be quite dramatic and beautiful, as well as being a lot of fun. The book contains instructions for making the sampler blocks as well as general information on rotary cutting, borders, and binding. Full color with lots of example quilts."
3,"Keep the Lock, Get Better Screws",The lock is solid. The screws are a joke. Installation would be a snap if not for cheap screws that you can't finish using to attach the lock.
4,Nice strong latch,"Installation took longer than I expected because the part that goes on the door was not flush with the part that mounts on the frame. I had some trouble with leveling the two so they would line-up after installation--in spite having marked the location for drilling the holes for the screws.Even a millimeter or two off will cause problems with the two sections not lining up correctly. So mark carefully before drilling the holes. I wish they had included a template to paste on the door/frame to make marking and drilling the holes easier.However, once installed, this latch works very well and looks quite sturdy."
4,Quality product; doesn't work well with raised molding,"Agree with other reviewers: quality product, but doesn't work with raised moldingPros:+++ Sturdy, well-machined all-metal design+++ Smooth action+++ Fairly simple to install (though see my notes)Cons:--- Screws too small--- Isn't well designed for raised moldingLike others I discovered challenges with our raised molding -- thus one rating star deduction for lack of clarity about that in the product description. Also, I needed to substitute my own 3"" screws for the part that mounted on the door frame -- really, the small screws provided were laughably insufficient. I managed to make it all work, but had some challenges during installation -- I was just barely able to get things properly aligned (lock components, screws, et al).Bottom line: Solid high-quality product better suited for flat surfaces -- NOT doors with raised molding"
2,Insipid and unsatisfying,"While Niles has done much credible work in the past, it's a sign of the dearth of fresh ideas in Hollywood that this flimsy adaptation has (evidently) been optioned for a movie. As has been noted here previously, nothing Niles has put together here contributes anything whatever to the ripe field of artificial resurrection, and the ending has all the feeling of an uninspired, lazy tack-on. Chee's art has some fine features, particularly his arterial sprays, but all in all this reads like a rush job w/out characterization, plot, theme or denouement. Disappointing."
5,Introduces young adult readers to a literary classic,"Getting young adult readers to pick up a literary classic like Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" is a hard call these days. Give them a book like Steve Nile's ""Wake the Dead"" and you won't get it back off them.Steve Niles modernizes the tale, and the artwork in this graphic novel is suprerb. It brings to life all the horrific and gory details of assembling a human body from evicerated car crash victims. Though the concept isn't new (it wasn't even in Mary Shelley's day, with the concept of a golem pre-dating her work) it does bring the story to life for a modern audience."
2,Too many plot holes,"This novel had great potential. Though he was very alpha, I liked the hero. He and the heroine made a great couple, even if he thought he hated her for most of the novel. Even if their first love scene was a bit... rough. Also, though the amnesia plot has been done before, this book made it fresh and interesting.But as I read on, I kept shaking my head at plot holes, subplots that went nowhere, and secondary characters that were wasted. (Sometimes literally!)On top of all that, the Big Surprise is too incredible to believe. It hinged on too many HUGE coincidences."
4,Awesome,I think Luke did a great job on this one & his guest stars on this cd were very hardcore.If you like Luke then this is a cd for you.
2,In the Nude is old school rap and it is outdated,"Luke really messes up with in the nude because the music is from 1993. 7 year old rap is very exstinct and it shows. The album cover is very explicit judging by it's title. The music is slow paced and there's no real music to be found. Luke wastes his talent by rapping not very rapidly, very slow paced. The whole album is taken in slow amounts. It is not a classic I suggest you buy the The Wu-Tang collection instead a much better rap group then Luke"
2,Misleading Information - Beware to Seller and Buyers,"The tag attached to this ""Jumbo Rusty Chain"" says it is ""OVER 6 feet long"" but when I received them in the mail, they are not over six feet at all.... they aren't even close. I would say they are close to FOUR feet, if that. So beware if you are looking for a longer chain. If I were Buycostume (the Seller).... I would contact their Chinese suppliers and have them either lengthen the chain when they make them or change the tag attached to read correctly. Thanks."
4,Career Counseling,"This is required reading for my graduate counseling course...CACREP requires career counseling. this book is very well written, has a good lay out and very useful"
3,Nice,Very cute. However they ran very large. I bought a size 0 for newborns and at three months they are still to large. They seem to be made very well.
5,Love these shoes + Free Fast Shipping,"I love these shoes they are the cutest, I bought them for my daughters first birthday which is coming soon and I am very happy with them. They are adorable, plus I received them the next day with their free shipping option. YOU CANT BEAT THAT! Thanks Amazon, free shipping makes me want to shop more!"
5,Great buy,The shoes was even more elegant than expected. It matched perfectly with my daughter's christening gown. A great buy!
3,Not as good as predecessor,This is a replacement grid for our Blanco sink. The previous model was a grill with bars only in one direction with clear feet and no side bumpers. That version protected the sink bottom but was largely invisible. After 10 years rust was appearing and the vinyl coating was damaged in spots from placing hot pots on it.This one fits perfectly but the crosshatch grid and black feet make it very visible and ugly. Unfortunately this appears to be the only option now from Blanco. Too bad.
1,Piece of crap!,"This toy is great if you only want your child to learn 10 letters! Because the other 16 don't seem to matter. It either got the letters wrong or just didn't even try and made some musical dismissal of them.I bought this to help my 4 yr old, who has told me she wants to learn to read, learn her letter sounds. This was her Valentine's gift and now we had to package it back up and it's going back to Target.I looked at the Word Whammer too, but no way, not after this fiasco. And whoever said it comes with the numbers was wrong, we got the newest model and there were no numbers for it to fail to recognize.I'll just get her something for her LeapPad or her V-Smile. I just feel bad that she knows her Valentine's gift has to go back. Very disappointing. LeapFrog is usually much better than this. We have Baby Tad and we have the My First Leappad and the regular Leappad and the talking Globe. This is our first disaster."
5,4 out of 4 of my kids love this toy!,"My household recieved this product as a gift when my 2nd child was about 13 months old. As I was teaching the oldest how to sound out words, the youngest would say ""Wait! I know!"" then if he could not rememeber the sound, or if his sister didn't get it right, he would bring us the toy and place the appropriate letter in the magnet frame and play the song. We have had this toy for 6 years and still I love it. My children learned alot at young ages from this toy and they have never had any trouble with pronunciation. It has never varied in performance unless batteries needed replaced. My children all love Leap Frog products and I have also found their customer service department to be well staffed and ready to help."
1,Defective Product,"We purchased a Leap Frog Fridge Phonics Alphabet and Numbers took it home and found it to be defective. 26 of the 36 characters told you the wrong information. We placed the ""T"" on the toy and it told us it was the number 7. We placed the number 8 on the toy and it told us it was the number 10. We returned this product and purchased another, same kind of defect, but it was telling us different letters and number than the first. I contacted Leap Frog about their defective product and have received no response. I think this is a wonderful product if it worked. I do not want my child to learn incorrect information!"
5,"You Will Play With This Toy, Too!","This is my daughter's tenth electronic, (the fifth LeapFrog), ABC toy and this is by far the best! Though it stays on our fridge, this toy travels with my daughter on all of our road trips. I love the volume control, the clear enunciation of the letter's sound, and its catchy tunes, (I even press the ABC button when I pass it by, even though my 2 yr. old daughter is not around!) She plays with this toy with no encouragement from me, and it is so cool that it draws everyone near to sound out the letter or sing the ABC. An exceptionally FUN learning toy!"
5,makes learning fun!!,"We just got this toy and my 2 year old loves it! He likes being able to change the letters himself, and he likes the repetitive nature and rythmn. I feel confident the use of this toy will engrain familiarity with the alphabet. Just seeing how he likes it and knowing the its content is so useful is very exciting! For [the price] I recommend it."
5,Great toy,My daughter is 4 and she loves to use this to put words together on the refrigerator. Also a great way to introduce letters to my 1 year old.
4,Great educational item!,This was a great buy! My son is 16 months old and is already trying to say the letter sounds along with Leap. =) I would highly recommend this toy to other parents who want some fun education on letters for their kids. the perks of the magnet letters themselves are that they are too big to fit under my fridge like those other little thin letter magnets (My son likes to throw the letters as well)
4,good toy,"my 20 month old likes this toy. he's been playing with it everyday since we opened it last week. i bought it for him because he's totally into letters and numbers, and figured it'd be good for his motor skills too. sometimes he has trouble getting the piece in but he's actually pretty good at it and getting better. the voice on the toy is a young boy's, and it's cute how the singing is kind of imperfect, like an actual child's. there isn't much variety with the songs it plays, but that's ok. i like the magnet letters because the magnet is not exposed like with cheap magnets you would buy. and though of course we could, we don't even play it on the fridge, i just have it all in a plastic container that we can open and play in the living room. glad i bought it!"
5,The best magnet alphabet set!,"The leapfrog set is so sturdy and durable. My 19 month old loves the fridge magnets, they are easy for her to hold. She just can't get enough of them. She can even put the letters in the sun player herself and it repeats the letter to her."
5,Leap Frog,My wife is an Assistant Principal and this was exactly what she was looking for. She helped a teacher introduce it in the classroom and the children line up to use it!
5,Great product,"This is a very useful product in terms of both educational as well as fun value, my daughter loves putting the letters in the socket and pressing to hear the sound of the letter. This is a great addition to the 'leapfrog letter factory' dvd that she watches and is learning from as well..My only issue here was that when I was placing the order, I thought I would be getting the lower case alphabet as shown in the product picture above, instead I got the uppercase alphabets..which is still fine but I like to know what I'm exactly getting. Overall a great learning tool."
3,Great toy..but make sure it says the right letters,My daughter received this as a birthday gift in Oct. and it would say the wrong letters-so we returned it and tried it out in the store so we knew it worked. She loves it and plays with it all the time. Well her great grandma bought her the letter and numbers one for Christmas.. and once again it says the wrong letters and numbers. I thought nothing of the first one but now I wonder how many are wrong--- Great toy but check to make sure it works right.
5,excellent starter tool,"The is a great ""toy"" that kids will enjoy, but it really teaches them the sounds of all the letters in the alphabet. It also sings the ABC song, which they can sing along with, and learn. The sounding out of letters is a KEY building block in learning to read. This is great for kids 3-5 years old."
5,Don't hesitate!,"A savvy mom recommended this to me but I hesitated because I didn't really want a bunch of letters all over my refrigerator but I bought it anyway and I'm so glad we did!Immediately my 2 & 3 year olds started singing along and later that day the 3 year old was pointing to letters & telling me what sounds they make. I could never have taught him that so quickly and effectively myself.They don't just leave it on the fridge either, they carry it from room to room. It's the first thing they show friends when they come over and we've had it for a month already.Don't hesitate - buy it!"
1,Didn't work!,Fresh out of the box this toy wouldn't recognize most of the letters. Poor quality. I'm sure it's educational if it WORKS!
4,"i like it, hope the kiddo will too","Product works as expected. For the kiddo, initially he had trouble putting in the letters but now he seems to be on board and does it correctly."
1,disappointed,"Normally I would love the toy for my son, but when I recieved it, it was BROKEN! The toy didn't read the letters correctly or some, not at all!"
2,Letters? What are they?,"We purchased this product for christmas for my son. Well, It only recognized half the letters and when I contacted the company they wanted me to send it back. Fine but they wouldn't pay for shipping etc. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. It's more trouble than it's worth."
1,Letters were misread! Very disappointed!,"I purchased this toy for my two-year-old son for Christmas, knowing that he would absolutely love it. But when we opened it Christmas morning, my husband and I were so disappointed. It misread some of the letters. For example, ""A"" was read as ""K"" or ""D"" as ""G"". I'm not sure if this is just this one particular box, but I just read a review of this toy at Target, and it seems other parents complained of the same thing, though those who purchased it before this year, seemed to be satisfied and very happy. If you plan on buying this toy, however, I would advise you save your receipt."
1,All the letters are wrong,I bought this for my daughters third birthday. Literally every other letter is wrong! I had to place the wrong letters on the top of the refrigerator so she wouldn't get totally confused.I'm completely disappointed.
2,wrong letter responses,I also got this item for my 2 yr old and it would be a SUPER toy if only it gave the correct responses for the letters. 15 out of 26 letters were wrong. I have since returned for a full refund.
2,Phonics? Are you kidding me?,"I bought this item because of the many great reviews. However, I have to strongly disagree with the phonics of this toy. I only tested 2 letters, ""A"" and ""W."" After I heard the them both, I decided not to test the rest and package everything up for a return to amazon. They do not sound adequate for teaching purposes. I really don't understand how this item gets a 4.5 star rating. You guys have to be kidding me!"
1,Quality doesn't hold up,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son for Christmas. As of last night (one week later), the toy no longer works. The main box will not stick properly to the refridgerator, it slides down to the floor and only half of the letters give the correct answer. The letter recognition is a tab system that I have seen on other toys and have never had a problem before. It has brand new batteries so I don't see why that could be an issue and I have checked to make sure that there was no debris or crumbs or any juice that may have made the buttons sticky and not recognize the letters and I have NOTHING. The toy should be 100% operational. Hopefully I received a faulty unit and my experience does not reflect a normal quality level for this toy. I will be contacting Leap Frog and Amazon for a replacement unit. Fingers crossed."
2,Maybe it's just my daughter,"This toy got great reviews and I had thought it would be great as well. Unfortunately, my daughter just uses it to press the ABC song button over and over...without actually listening to the ABC song. She has no interest in putting the letters into the toy...maybe this toy just isn't for her."
1,beware!,"I ordered this for my 6 year old niece who is having a hard time learning her letters and sounds. It sounded like a perfect learning tool. As soon as it came, we started playing it, and the machine would say the wrong letters and sounds! I cleaned the batteries like it said too, still nothing. I returned it, rcvd a new one, (at least that was easy enough, thank you amazon), then the second one did the same thing. I sent it back again and got a refund. I was extremely disappointed and if any has this, please check it constantly before your little one gets screwed up and never learns the alphabet. A great idea if it had worked!"
1,Mine never worked - exchanged twice,I exchanged this twice and all of them had the same problem - would not say the correct letter. I followed the instructions and cleaned the posts and replaced the batteries but a number of the letters were still said wrong. I finally just got the money back.
2,says wrong letters,"My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday, and she immediately loved it. It worked well for a little while, but for some reason started telling her the wrong letters. For example, she would put in the letter ""B"" and it would sing the ""X"" song. I tried cleaning it and changing the batteries, but was unable to get it to sing the right letters. I didn't want it confusing her so I eventually threw it in the trash. It would be a great toy if it had continued to work properly."
5,I don't know a toddler who doesn't like this toy!,"I love the fridge phonics toy. I got it for both my 2 year old daughter and nephew, and they both love it. I like the size of the magnets, great for little hands and they don't dissapear under the fridge. We haven't lost a letter yet. I am definately getting the next toy, the one that makes 3 letter words. (I can't remember the name of it) One suggestion for Leap Frog: I would love to have a large cling mat with all of the letters so my daughter could do matching as well. It would be an inexpensive accessory that I think many parents would love to have, and if it is that clinging vinal material that wont harm the fridge that would be perfect."
3,This is a great toy but NOT very durable.,This is a great toy but NOT very durable. I have two-year-old twins and they will occasionally knock the base unit off the refrigerator. I've re-soldered a wire inside the unit three times but it still keeps breaking. If it were more durable I'd give it 5 stars.
5,The best toy i've EVER purchased,"I purchased this toy for my 18 month old daughter and it works absolutely fine...She learned and recognizes five letters so far and we've only had it for one week...she also sings the abc's very well considering the time we've had it. I recommend this toy to everyone who is trying to teach their child the ABC's, sounds of letters, recognition....IT'S WONDERFUL! Definitely worth the money...BUY IT NOW!"
4,A+,"My 3 year old son loves these magnets. He can easily turn it off and on. I like that there is two settings for the volume. He pushes the letters to hear the sounds of the letters or he can sing the alphabet song. The letters are a big hard plastic, not the cheap ones you find in the store. If one gets knocked off the fridge it will not dissapear under the fridge because it is too large for it to get under there. What a great learning toy!"
4,Love this!,My daughter has a blast with this. I do not keep it on the fridge however b/c the letter kept getting thrown under it when my daughter played with it. So I keep them on our dishwasher & that works great for us!! She loves it there & now her brother can have his stuff on the fridge still. Once she gets older I will probably get the WORD WHOMP (sp?) for her as well but this is a great start for her she is 15 months.
3,Letters say the wrong thing,"I don't know if this is a nationwide problem or not, but here in the St. Louis area these are being returned quite frequently. I took one back my son received for Christmas which was a duplicate, and the person at the store told me to hang on to the receipt I had for the other one because they were all being returned. When I asked what the reason was, she said because it reads the wrong letter. For example, A is in the holder, but it says C. I experienced this with my unit as well, but I changed the batteries and smacked it around a couple of times, and so far it has been working just fine. The other day when I was making another return at a different store, I noticed one behind their counter which had been returned. When I asked why, I was given the same reason and told that they were pretty much all being returned. When it works, it's great. When it doesn't, it can be a bit confusing for a little one trying to learn the alphabet."
5,Mommies helper in the kitchen,My son got this gift for his first birthday. He loves it. He doesnt really know how to put the letters in correctly he does try tho. He does press the letter and hold down making the letter repeat but thats ok he is learning. He dances to the song that plays with the letter or if you press the music note. I can get thru preparing a meal with him in the kitchen playing with this toy. My friends 8 month old also loved the toy. I would wait till they were a little older then a month before you purchase though.
1,Defective!,"I was so excited to see the great reviews this toy got before I purchased it for Christmas ... Well... I was very upset to find that about 10 of the letters just ""Ding"" when you press them, and than 3 of our letters said the wrong name and sound! Odviously my two and one half year old can not learn the letters when this great machine is telling him the wrong answers so I will be returning it. I'm surprised that this is a Leap Frog product."
4,Will be a lot of fun...,"This toy is really too old for my little one at this point, but that doesn't stop her from having a good time with it. She loves to hear the song play and chews on the letters! But in time I think it will be very beneficial for her."
4,Great idea,"But my son prefers listening to the abc song, rather than listening to the individual letter sounds. Ah, well!"
5,Teach your baby the alphabet!,"My daughter has played with these letters since she was about 10 months old. She's almost 2 now, and can recognize all the letters. This set made it fun for her and we've achieved a lot without having to work very hard at it."
5,My daughter loves this toy.,My daughter is three years old now and got this when she was two. She still loves to play with this as does her 11 mths old brother. She loves to sing along to the songs. I love that is teaches them the abc song. Great toy for toddlers!
4,Loves the letter holder,"My [...] got this for her 2nd Christmas last year. She started off putting all of the letters into the holder. But now she prefers to play with just the holder, pushing the music button over and over (it plays the ABC song). Thanks to this toy she now knows her ABC's at age [...]. I am sure as she gets older she will play with the seperate letters more. Good toy."
3,Go Ahead and Upgrade to the Word Whammer!,"This is a cute toy, but without a lot of growth potential. When you put a letter into the slot, it sings a short song about the letter and the sound it makes (""B says ""buh"", B says ""buh"", every letter makes a sound, B says ""buh""""). The A is particularly hard to understand, because rather than saying ""A says ah"", it says ""ah says ah"". Seems like perhaps a mistake? But the rest of the letters are clear. The song is too short to really ""dance"" to, unlike the fridge farm that has a nice long song. So it really is just about teaching the letter names and sounds. You get the same functionality and much more with the Word Whammer. The one advantage to the Fridge Phonics over the Word Whammer is that it is smaller and therefore more portable. The letters from Fridge Phonics also work in the Word Whammer, but they aren't really needed since the Word Whammer gives duplicates of most popular letters."
4,Very educational and entertaining...,"This toy is very educational. My daughter loves to put the pieces in the holder and make the sounds right along with the toy. Before I bought the toy I read a previous review about using it for entertainment while cooking dinner, etc. and that has been how the toy has been used. The only thing I would do to make this toy better is make the magnets a little bit stronger. But, that is my only complaint. She loves it and I could not be any happier with the purchase."
4,leapfrog fridge toy,My daughter loves this toy much more than the regular fridge magnets that we had on the fridge. It sings the alphabet and tells her what each letter sounds like. I also like that the letters are not a choking hazard.
1,Learning made difficult,I got 1 and it didn't work right so sent it back and the second one didn't work either. I totally believe it had something to do w/shipping it in the winter. After I sent these 2 back to you I went to Walmart to get one and had it in the trunk for a while (when it was very cold) and it didn't work right either when I got it home. I actually took it back and got another one (vowed that was the last time and it was) and put it inside the car in the warm and went straight home and it works great! I just think the cold did something to it cause it would give you the wrong letters for what you put in or nothing at all for a couple of them. Great product but shipping may be a problem w/this one.
5,Fridge Phonics is Great,"I have bought this for 5 or 6 children and have heard amazing responses from parents and kids alike. Erin wrote her name with her letters at 18 months. It is a great toy for introducing the letters of the alphabet.Really great item, I would strongly consider. It is in my ""arsenal"" of favorites for my nieces and others."
3,Great Toy,This toy is great fun for my daughter and me. My only complaint is that this thing eats batteries like nobody's business. If you leave it on for an extended period of time your batteries are toast!!! I strongly recommend rechargeable batteries.
3,Z says Eh...?,"At first the product was great, my little one had fun with the letters and all was well. But after a bit of use, the letters began to sound like one another because the 'voice' became scratchy sounding. To her, the frog always sings, ""Z says..."", although it may be C,D, or E she is using. She still loves the alphebet song, but I'm afraid she's getting her sounds confused."
4,Leapfrog word whammer,"For Christmas my 2 year old recieved the fridge phonics. We even got the one that has the numbers. (Walmart exclusive) Anyhow, half the letters worked and half didn't. I took it back and purchased the word whammer. Again, the same problem. I called leapfrog and the service tech had me check the little prongs on the pad. One of the six little prongs was stuck. As soon as i popped it up it started working. I have been reading alot of reviews with the same problem. Give it a try! I hope this helps."
3,Fridge Phonics,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She is 2 and just loves it. However, when we first opened it many of the letters malfunctioned. I replaced the batteries in the fridge unit and still a few of the letters were malfuntioning. After my daughter played with it for a few minutes we again tried the malfuntioning letters and they worked properly. Now I am wondering how to get rid of the song that keeps running in my head!"
5,Tons of fun for youth and adults,I think the parents in this case have more fun. With only 26 letters we try and spell out phrases. The 3 yo likes the full ABC song button.
5,very educational and fun,"This toy my 2 1/2 year old daughter has loved from the day we got it for her on christmas and still enjoys playing with it. She has always loved music and with the song part that plays for each letter, she has picked up learning her letters. I have worked with her to learn her letters but she has done must of learning from the toy itself. She loves to put them in place through out the day whenever we go into our kitchen. And the toy itself is very durable she has thrown the pieces around and they are still working fine. I would recomend this toy to anyone it is great."
5,Perfect for our toddler,We really wanted a magnetic alphabet for our fridge that had internal magnets so that no little pieces would ever fall out and create a choking hazard. These are wonderful. Just the right size and chunky-ness for our 17-month old to handle. She loves to play with them and move them them around. She also really loves to push the button that plays the alphabet song. I think these will be great for years to come!
5,what a great idea!,"my son got this as a gift for his 2nd birthday and he hasn't stop playing with it since! he loves hearing the songs and trying to say the letters and sounds each letter makes. he's also learning his letters, so when i ask him to put in the letter ""D"" he knows what it looks like. what a great toy! i highly reccomend this to anyone. i could go on and on and on..."
1,Defective,"Our seems to be defective because no matter what letter you put in, the toy thinks it's F! We tried replacing the batteries. I even went out and bought new batteries & cleaned the battery compartment (as it explains in the directions). It doesn't make a difference. I was SO disappointed because my son really wants to play with it but I don't want him to think every letter says F! I have talked to other moms who have had this problem. I am returning it to the manufacturer."
5,Fun,My son is turning 2 and LOVES to change the letters on the LeapFrog. He has some trouble getting some letters in correctly...it plays a catchy toon that I still have in my head and my son loves to dance with the ABC song.
4,Great toy - horrible packaging,"1 star for the packaging!!!Why did this need to be packaged like it was the Royal Jewels? EGADS, it was sooooo difficult to get the pieces out of the packaging. This is ridiculous. I bought it for my grandson and it took my daughter and I at least five minutes to remove the packaging (with the help of scissors).Not only is this silly, but it is such a waste of materials."
1,Buyer beware! This does NOT come with lower case letters!,"I bought this product based upon the image that I saw on this particular link. It shows lower case letters, so that is what I expected to get. However, when it arrived, it only came with uppercase. This was very disappointing. Then I found out that you have to purchase the lower case letters but I cannot find them in stock anywhere. I still have not opened the package because I wanted to exchange it for a lowercase version, but it is not available. Why is it being decided for us that children should learn uppercase letters before lowercase letters...when they learn to write and read they need to be familiar with lowercase letter forms. I rated this product low because I have not opened the package and therefore cannot rate the things that I have not experienced. I plan to send this back. I am considering purchasing Fridge Words(tm): Magnetic Word Builder instead.LeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Alphabet Set - Styles May Vary"
1,Annoying!,"I bought this toy awhile back for my daughter, and this was one of her least favorite things to play with, not to mention that the voice that sang the songs was totally annoying and irratating. not to mention that most of the pieces ended up underneath the refridgerator. never the less the toy ended up being tossed in the trash and neither me nor my daughter miss it at all."
1,Cute toy if it worked properly.,"I seen this product on T.V. and thought it was adorable and perfect for my 19-month old baby girl. I purchased it at a store nearby for a Christmas present. I didn't read the reviews on this until now and have also been disappointed. The letters are incorrect ""O"" says it is a ""Q"". Thinking that the demo batteries were the problem, I changed them. Still would not work properly. Took it back to the store to get a new one and still does not work properly. As someone else posted--SAVE THE RECEIPT AND BOX. I am going to make my third trip back to the store to purchase something else. It is to bad because it seems like it would really be a great learning tool if it did work properly. The song was catchy and it would have occupied my duaghter."
1,Did not say correct letter sounds,"We bought this product for our son for Christmas. It seemed like the perfect gift for him to learn his letters and the letter sounds. On Christmas morning we open it up and the only letter that was correct was the E, of course the E was the demo letter. Unfortunately, the stores are out of stock on this product so we may upgrade the the Word Whammer and hope the letters are correct."
1,I wish it worked properly because DD loves playing w/the letters,"This product is such a great and fun idea. Unfortunately half of the letters do not work, for ex: the ""T"" says it an ""N"". Since I now see this is an ongoing problem, I really wish Leapstart would correct it. I will be very cautious beforing buying anything they make."
5,Lovin' fridge phonics!,"As a new parent, I know that I worry a bit too much about my 18 month old who seems to be the 1 hit wonder when it comes to saying new words....he doesn't seem interested in repeating words once he has said them. A friend recommended this toy, and WOW! Day 1--- my son said 3 of the letters--clear as day, and repeated them. I was so impressed. We also have a stainless refrigerator that is not magnetic. THis is not a problem-- the pieces are safe, easy for him to manipulate, and he easily carries the speaker piece. He loved this toy and has expanded his vocabulary instantly. I will recommed it to everyone."
5,Reading Specialist Approved,"I'm an elementary reading specialist, and I have to say that if kids are exposed to letter sounds early on, they are in a FAR better place when they come to Kindergarten! Great toy for early learners!"
5,saw one at a relative's,"Knew our grandbaby would love it, when he couldn't stop playing with one at his cousin's! So I came home and ordered immediately and I was right...he loves"
4,"Lots of fun, only 1 flaw","I purchased the LeapFrog Fridge Phonics for my 1 year old. I know, that is a little young, but his almost 2 year old friend has a set and every time we went over to their house my son had so much fun with this alphabet set. So, we bought them and he still loves them, plays with them just about everyday. The only flaw is that sometimes the letters somehow get mixed up, like Scout will on occasion call the letter m, ""a""."
5,One of the best yet!,"My 2 year old loves this set and will sit and play with it for a long time. It's well made, lots of fun and really does help with the alphabet and letter recognition. Worth the money, will be giving this one for gifts. Once again Leap Frog has made my tot happy!"
2,"Be careful, this can scratch your fridge!","Be very careful with this toy and others that use magnets to stick to your fridge. We removed the item from the fridge to find dozens of scratches behind where it was. There was a tiny fragment of metal sticking out of the plastic surface that touches the fridge (behind that is the magnet) and any movement, large or small, caused it to damage our fridge. In our case, the fridge is easy clean stainless steel, and cannot be repaired."
2,half of the letters don't work,"I got this for my son for Christmas and he got to open it early and we tried putting the letters in and a couple of them say the wrong letter when you push it in everytime. And half the others don't say anything, but I have them on the fridge so that he can play with the letters."
5,"Great, educational toy for children who never lose things","My son (now 5) taught himself the alphabet with this toy when he was just a toddler. He was pretty meticulous about keeping the magnets on the fridge. I wanted to pass it down to my daughter, but we can't keep track of the letters because she's sort of a... free spirit. Yeah. I am going to get her the leap frog phonics bus so she can learn and not make a mess.I particularly love that this toy teaches the sounds of the letters and not just the name. It's fantastic, and keeps them busy. I'm not a particularly good teacher, so thanks leap frog!"
4,Great!...and educational too!,Kept my 18 month old entertained for hours; easy for her to place the magnets in and out of its magnetic tray.
5,Fantastic Toy!,"My daughter LOVES this toy, and has been using this since about 15 months. At 18 months, she was able to identify nearly every letter. Here is a peek at this toy in action with an 18 month old.[...]HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Well worth the $20!"
5,great learning tool,this is a great learing tool. it's convenient and sturdy. My child plays with it all of the time when she is in the kitchen with me. It is on the refrigerator within easy reach.
3,Great but scratches stainless steel fridge,"My 20 month old was excited to see this on my sister's fridge, so I bought it for her. Its a great educational toy but my daughter kept on dragging the letters and now I notice a bunch of scratches on my 1 months old Fridge, I quickly put them somewhere else. Other than that I do recommend this toy for educational purposes, my daughter is able to recognize letters and sometimes pronounces them clearly."
5,A++++++,"I bought this item as well as the Spanish version for my daughter when she was about 16 months old and in a matter of weeks she knew all the letters as well as the alphabet song. So, don't wait until the recommended age (2 yrs) to get it."
5,Our daughter loves this,We had purchased the farm animals fridge magnets prior to seeing this one. Our daughter just loves dancing to the ABC song and in the beginning she spent hours figuring out how to put the letter magnets on the base unit. She still plays with this on a daily basis and constantly is taking the base unit off the fridge to carry around with her so her ABC song is almost always nearby.
5,My little guy gets so excited learning with this toy!,"We bought this toy for my son when he was 15 months old. I didn't think he would be ready to learn the alphabet yet, but I wanted to get it for him to get him familiar with it. In the past 3 months, he has learned HALF of the alphabet!!! We have not been pushing him to learn the letters, he has been learning them on his own. He gets so excited when he sees letters he knows, whether it be out in town or written on a piece of paper. This is a great item!"
5,"fun, educational and a great distraction for the kitchen","My son has had this since he was 15 months old and can tell you the sound of almost every letter now (he's now 21 months). It's a really fun toy to him, and works as a great distraction for him when he wants to be in the kitchen with me while I cook. Most homes with toddlers have fridge alphabets, anyways, this one is interactive and even sings the alphabet song. I recommend this toy without any reservation."
5,This mom loves Leapfrog!,"I bought this for my 15 month old just over a week ago. He plays with it constantly. He loves to dance to the ABC song. While he's a little young to be absorbing the actual phonics aspect, another great thing about this toy is the help in developing motor skills (i.e. placing the letter in the proper way, which gets a big grin out of him every time he's successful). I must say that any song or sounds repeated over and over and over can get tiresome. However, Leapfrog products do tend to be at the lower end of the annoying scale."
5,Love it!!,Another great leap pad toy! My 19 month old daughter took to this right-away. It is easy enough for her to do all on her own. Once again I am humming a leap frog tune at work. I hope they come out with numbers to use with the set.
5,Daughter loved it from 2 months on,"My daughter was crazy for this when she was just 2 months old. She would shake and smile, it was adorable. She is now a year old and any time she is crying - a quick walk to the fridge magnet to play the abc song makes her laugh. I take the unit anywhere with a piece and she loves to listen to it over and over (I'm sure other people aren't as happy about the repeat performance!). I would highly recommend this product to any parents. Get it early on and your baby will repeat letters and recognize them by the time they are 8-9 months old like our daughter has."
1,"Kid son love, but beware of this:","While 4 stars may be what my son would rate this if he could talk better, I purchased this new and when we got home his older siblings brought to my attention that the letters where different than what the toy was saying they were. You would put a ""G"" in and hear ""J"" for that letter verbally. This was the case with more than half the alphabet. I called the company who had me on old 45 minutes because the Fly Pen was eating up their phone time with other problems. They told me to take a Qtip with alcohol on it and clean the prongs in the window where the letter goes, then use a tweezer to pull out the prongs that were too far in (brand new prongs out of the box mind you). This was only ruining the plastic prongs and not working on loosening them up for the tweezer to pull out. Returned for refund to the store and explained it to them. Kid appeal, adult aggravation."
5,My 2 yr old loves it!!!,"My husband and I bought this for our 2 yr old for his birthday, from the start he loves it. The only problem is he takes it off the fridge so we put removable mounting squares to keep in on. He has learned his ABCs and can now count to 10. This is just since the beginning of November. He goes and sits by the fridge for 30 mins playing."
4,Functional and holds her interest,"My daughter received this as a gift a few months before her second birthday. It's very sturdy, colorful, and holds tight to our fridge. She can easily put the letters in the slots and push it to hear the song (based on Farmer in the Dell) telling what sound(s) the letter make. Or she can push the other button to hear the jazzy ABC song. She does like to sing along.But I concur with the earlier review about the ""learning songs"" teaching only so much. You can make your own words on the fridge and sound them out yourself -- COW, DOG, CAT, etc. -- but then you might as well use the regular magnetic letters that repeat common letters."
5,Great learning tool,"We got this toy a few months ago for our now 19 month old. SHe loves it and has really learned from it. Even my 7 year old likes it! Works great and has volume control, which is a nice feature. I give it an A+!"
5,By far the best gift ever!,My daughter received this for Christmas and it is by far the best gift she received. At the time she was eighteen months old and loved it and she still loves it now. It is as much fun as it is educational AND it is easy to use. It doesn't get any better than that!!
2,Not a quality product,"I originally received this product as a gift. When I opened it up for the first time in front of my daughter, many of the letters did not function properly. When I put an ""A"" in, the unit said it was a ""C"". I didn't want my daughter to be confused, so I called LeapFrog and told them about the problem. They told me to clean the tabs with alcohol and then pry any loose tabs up with a some tweezers. I did this and then all the good letters became bad and the bad letters worked. I eventually sent the unit back to the factory and they sent me a brand new one. I opened up this unit and it had the exact same problem. I opened up the entire unit, unscrewed some of the electronics and then approached the tabs from the inside - this seemed to fix it. Apparently this is the norm with this product, read the reviews! I am not the first one to encounter this problem! LeapFrog - you need to review the quality of your products!"
4,Best LeapFrog toy out there.,"I must say that I am NOT a fan of leapfrog toys, but this is just wonderful. Most of the ABC toys, my 2 year old just pushes buttons while the toy tries to get the letter and sound out, while not paying attention to what he is doing, and he doesn't need to go through the entire alpahbet just to get to letters. This toy, he actually has to pick up a letter piece, put it in the thing to push and while he is looking at it, it says the letter, sound and a little song (which I can not get out of my head). I also love it because it can stay on our fridge and not have pieces all over my house.The A does sound a little confusing. The first time it sounds like ""AY"" then it sounds more like ""EH"". More like ""Ay says eh and Eh says ah."" But that is the only letter that annoys me. Other than that it is wonderful. I would love to have more of these fridge toys from Leapfrog"
4,Get it when they turn one.,"We love this thing. Our daughter is 15 months old and already knows M, O and X. :) She seems predisposed to language, books, etc, but the Fridge letter set doesn't hurt, I'm sure. Just this morning she exlaimed ""Emmmmmmmmm!"" and pointed to the M on the fridge.The only thing they need to do better is the clarity of the recordings. ""D says Duh"" sounds kind of like ""D says Buh"". And when the kid says ""A"" it sounds like ""Eh."" But I'm not going to quibble too much... it's not like it's the fridge set is the ONLY way they're going to learn letters and sounds. And most letters sound as they should. It's a neato toy--and durable too. Our daughter is slamming it around and, so far, it's taking a licking and keepin' on ticking. I'd buy it again."
5,Leapfrogn Fridge Phonics Alphabet,"We bought this toy for our son for Christmas. He is just under 4 years old and already knows most of his letters but it solidified his knowledge and taught him the remainder of his letters withing a week. He LOVES to play with it, he puts in the letters and sings with the toy. The only thing I wish is that it came with lower case letters as well as upper. I know you can purchase a set of lower case but they are ridiculously expensive. In a few months is his birthday and we'll probably be buying the fridge phonics word builder set which comes with lower case letters... the letters from this toy and that are interchangeable (we bought the word building for our niece and she loves it)."
2,Scatches all over our new stainless steel fridge,"The boys love it, we received it as a gift yesterday and on the fridge it went. I just found my 3 months old stainless steel fridge full of scratches. NOT GOOD :("
2,SAD TO SAY THIS IS THER FIRST TIME I HAVE BEEN DISSASTIFIED WITH A PURCHASE,This is the first Amazon purchase that has been a BIG disappointment. It was used but DIRTY and unusable as is.
4,"Extremely unhappy with the gift wrapping that I thought came with this, in a box, not closed and not wrapped. NEED REFUND.",Impossible to find out where to get refund for the gift wrap I paid for and did not get! Do not waste your money on gift wrapping!
4,"Great toy, nice features, very portable","Title pretty much covers it. Our daughter loves it. She's already able to turn it on and off as well as knows what the buttons due. Still working on getting her to switch from one letter to the next, but at 18 months she appears to get most of how it works."
5,A Great Learning Toy!,"My daughter, Maria, loves her magnets. She got them a few months ago. She's 17 months old now, and knows the letter M. We say, ""Where's the letter M?"" She'll pick it up and say ""Mmmm"".She plays with her magnets everyday. They do get all over the kitchen floor, though. But, it's worth it!"
4,Expensive,I bought this for my 10 month old grandson for Christmas. For the size and what it does it is EXPENSIVE!
