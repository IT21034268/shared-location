4,Connections a bit stiff,"Only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is how hard it is to push the relay into the socket, I realize you don't want it too loose so things fall out or don't have a firm connection, just felt it didn't have to be so hard to push a relay in this."
3,It's OK,"I bought two of these (for a total of four relays); one was constructed well and assembled without issue. However, I was disappointed when trying to install the relays, 2 of the pins came loose on one of the sockets. I had to re-bend the holding tab several times and finesse the relay into place. I have concerns about the long term durability because of this issue."
3,Just OK,"Definitely not an antiperspirant. It works okay, may not hold up to a day outside in the heat. I guess that's the trade-off for the ""natural"" ingredients."
1,Yuck,"The search for a decent, paraben-free deodorant continues..I was hopeful about this one but it smells just awful to me - the only thing I can liken it to is artificial room freshener. I'm afraid that I just threw the thing away, rather than returning it, because it seems more trouble than it's worth."
1,"Ouch, Please revoke this guys director card! One of the worst films...Period","Yikes...not sure why these guys choose to actually shoot this movie on film. Definitely not worth the money nor any of your time!Even fans of Michael Madsen will run from this one.Whoever this director is, someone needs to step in and prevent this guy from making more fil..er...crap?! His talents lie outside of film making. Bad story, terrible script, terrible direction, no artistic choices, odd choice of actors and a director who clearly cannot direct, especially action...if that's what you call this.Any 6 grader with a cap gun and a camera phone can come up with something better than what you see here....RUN AWAY, FAR, FAR AWAY!!!"
3,"Good idea, poor quality","Cool controlers, but had trouble with getting both to work at the same time. Within a couple of weeks, one was broken and unusable. The other has held up better but the battery cover didn't fit in well and the latch broke pretty quickly. Good range on these though, I can play in other rooms in the house. Cool lights, and they remind you that you left it on. I would buy a different brand next time."
4,Hex Wrench,"Can't rate the Hex wrench bit socket set yet, couldn't use it because I needed smaller bits."
3,Bought wrong item,"I should have looked more closely. This is not a set of sockets, but the male equivalent, that is, hex bits that can be used with a socket wrench handle. The description as ""sockets"" is a bit misleading, but it would be too much trouble to return them so I am keeping them."
5,nice product for the money,"Just what I was looking for, I don't need hex bits often, but sometimes need several sizes. Good compact size and quality"
3,"Cheap, but bits are very rust prone","I'll keep this short. I can't speak for the strength of the bits. So far they work fine.But just yesterday, I left a bit out on a table for a day, exposed only to the air, and today it was all rusty.I had a Japanese Rubicon CR-V screwdriver left out in the open for years and it is still rust free."
4,Nice set - hope it lasts,"Just picked up this set of hex wrench bit sockets and they seem to be made fairly well considering they are manufactured in Taiwan. Don't think you could put major torque on these things, but for normal usage they should last.I love that they come in a blow-molded plastic case - it's going to be hard for me to loose any of these!Don't think there is any warranty with these, but the were pretty inexpensive...much less than Craftsman."
4,good quality,I have not used this yet but looks to be good quality for the home owner use. I would tell a friend to buy
5,For the sticky bolts and nuts,The angle type allen wrenchs are sometimes too short or awkword to use properly to add preassure to the fasteners. Use of these allen type sockets make short work of these difficult projects.
4,Good hex set,"No problems with this set, all the bits seem sturdy. Comes in a nice hard-plastic case with a cover. I would recommend this set. Just make sure the tips are long enough for your needs, if you have any recessed screws to get to, the actual hex part of the bit is only about a half inch long on the smaller bits."
2,"Disappointed, bent hex bit","Never even got a chance to use them, opened the box and one of the hex bits was mounted in the socket at an angle. Not enough quality control on these units."
5,A Positive Message on Dementia,Inspiring story of how one sufferer from ementia ivercame guge difficulties to lead a varied and fulfilling life.
5,Mirrors can also fly.,This is our second mirror as the first one decided to fly away. It really works great as long as you remember to store it before you drive off down the road.
1,Trash,"Seller sent on time, as promised. Unfortunately, the product itself is very cheaply made. It barely fits on my tailgate (2009 F150) and it's difficult at best to see anything in the mirror. Maybe worth 5-10 bucks...definitely not worth $30. Save your money for something else..."
3,Not the guy from Soul Coughing,"I did not buy this CD so don't pay attention to my rating. I did notice that people who bought this CD, as is listed above, obviously thought that Francis Doughty is the lead singer of Soul Coughing. This is not true. The lead singer of Soul Coughing is Mike Doughty and you can get more information about him at www.superspecialquestions.com Mike currently has a solo career and his new music is spectacular. I've seen him live a couple of times and, while his new style is a departure from the old Soul Coughing sound, his new sound is a welcome change."
4,Good unit,Owned the smaller one for about four years and wanted a larger one so I bought this. It is great except that if you mount it on the top of your deck be prepared to have to drill through the metal bracket in the front in order to put a screw through it to keep it from sliding off the top rail when you empty it. Funny how the smaller one has it and this one does not given that it is a lot larger and needs it even more than the small one did.
1,Don't waste your money,"This was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. First, it was impossible to mount on my deck railing, even after getting assured by customer service it would work. Then, I got a stand for it and had the ""certified"" extension cord running to it. Within 2 weeks the plug from the bird bath that went into the extension cord CAUGHT ON FIRE!!!!!!! I called the company (again) and they told me that it is not their fault and they would not do anything for me. Period. I left 3 messages for the ""manager"" and they have still not called me back. Incidentally, they are located VERY close to me and I even offered to bring the product to them so they could see it. They wanted nothing to do with me doing that. I highley recommend NOT buying this bird bath or any other made by Allied. Now I am out around $100 (bird bath, stand, extension cord) with nothing to show for it."
4,Heated bird bath,"The heater really does keep the water from freezing and the birds (and squirrels) love it. However, the first one I had stopped working within a year. Even though I wrapped where the plug and extension cord join with electrical tape, the plug rusted. The directions say to unplug the bath in the summer months and store the cord under the bowl -- which I didn't do. Anyway, I liked it enough to buy the same heated bird bath as a replacement. The coil heaters you put in a bird bath never seem to work and this tilt one does."
1,Poor chinese quality.,"We received ours quickly via Amazon, great service as usual, and the sole reason this even got one star.The bottom base of the unit is not made very well, (somewhat rounded up on two edges) and hard to get standing straight up. The base is hollow, and even with a bunch of rocks in there it still is not sturdy at all. Since it's summer we haven't tried the heater. I'll say it looked and sounded better on ""paper"", but it's poorly made. We're thinking of throwing the stand away and mounting to the deck rails."
5,Great Birdbath!,"This is the second one I have had. The first one lasted over 10 years and was working before being destroyed in a severe storm. It has performed when the temp. was nearly ""0"". Sturdy construction. I would recommend!"
3,Mixed review,The bird bath itself works well. The water stays unthawed even in sub zero degree weather so thats good. On the negative side the mounting bracket is piece of junk! As I dump water into the bath it keeps tilting and the water comes right out. If a large bird lands on it the bath tips and the water comes out. I followed the instructions on the sheet and its just a very poor design. I would rather it fasten securely and not be able to tilt than to have this feature.
5,The birds love it,"Have had for one full winter and worked great. Always a bird or two bathing or taking a drink. Needed to secure the base with a couple of screws, but not a big deal."
3,barcket assembly,"Just bought a model 650 (store purchase, not online) and attached to my deck. The mounting hardware for the deck is OK, but the bracket assembly that attaches to the bird bath(is supposed to lock the birdbath to the deck clap)is poorly designed and doesn't secure the birdbath to the deck bracket. Be prepared to do a little modification to make it lock."
5,Good buy,This bird bath is very easy to install and requires no drilling so it can be moved. Right after I put it out the temp. dropped to 17 degrees and it kept the water thawed. If I were to buy another I would want the same one.
3,Great idea for right application ...,"Great idea, but the birds in Alaska haven't touched it in the weeks it's been up. Perhaps, they will in time or during the summer. However, that is my deal, here is what I like and don't like about this product.Pros:The base has a very sure and positive lock to my 6"" deck rail. The screws are made for either 4 or 6"", so I have these very long screws sticking out. Easy fix ... cut them or buy shorter ones.Keeps water melted down to 3 degrees so far. Will test it further as the winter progresses. However, I may end up putting it away if the birds continue to not use it.Cons:The basin screws on to the base unit in a very loose fashion. There is no positive lock mechanism and therefore, there is no way to level the basin. If you try to level the base to match the basin, the basin still settles off kilter. This wht I rate it a 3."
2,Don't buy it for the heated part,This bird bath attaches nicely to lots of different pedestals and mounts. I plugged it in and it heated the water once and that was it. It never heated again. I returned to using my old drop in bird bath heater. It's a nice mount anywhere bird bath so I gave it more than 1 star over the no heat problem.
1,Bad design or bad manufacturing,"I have 3 engineering degrees and a full shop and I still can't get this to be level or secure. It was not made for a composite railing so I attached a square piece of Azek to the top and made sure that was level. Then I installed the unit and tried and tried to get it level. The upper bracket is supposed to ""lock"" in the locking hole but that is so flimsy it never holds the piece secure. I would never buy a product from this company again; nor do I recommend you do so."
3,Poor hinging,"The water stays open just fine but the hinge system that is used for tipping the birdbath is poor. The small catch's, for lack of a better term, do not hold well and you must be very careful handeling the birdbath or you will drop it over the side."
4,Heated Bird bath,The bird bath itself works great! The bracket for attaching it to the rail needs some work. We really struggled to get the bath level and attached firmly and had to wire it down to get it firmly seated.
1,Can't recommend it,I was fine with this until this winter when I had to plug it in. It sure keeps the water from freezing but it constantly blows the breaker to my backyard outlet. Something is wrong or unreliable within the heater circuit.
2,Not very stable - doesn't install correctly,"This bird bath for a balcony railing is a great idea, but the product does not install correctly. There is no way to stabilize and level the bird bath because the threads on the post where the dish is supposed to screw on do not hold the dish in place strongly enough to keep the dish from leaning to one side. Great idea, not executed well."
4,Very nice bird bath,"Works well. Only problem so far is it did not come with bolt to hold onto bracket. Called company and they sent one out without any questions, but they sent wrong one. Hardware store was quicker than trying again.We have yet to get to the real cold weather yet here in Wisconsin but it works nicely with the weather that we have had. I have been turning it off at night via indoor switch installed by picture window and it takes a little while for the ice to melt in the morning.Bracket that came with it works suprisingly well. I had to install two shims to make it level since deck rail is a little crooked. Bracket makes it very easy to empty bath for cleaning if you want too. I did however put stones in the bottom to encourage bird to bath more often."
1,Do Not Purchase,It does NOT perform as depicted. It is extremely hard to put on a railing as shown. It is not worth the price of the unit.
5,Mignight Special,Brings back the memories of the bands of the 70s. Much better than listening to just a CD when you can watch the bands with all the 70s hair and outfits. Very intertaining and memorable.
1,These Midnight Special's Were SERIOUS CRAP,"For One Thing Each Band Is Suppossed To Have Their Complete Set Of Songs !!!!And On The 1978 One CHEAP TRICK Performed ""Surrender"" and ""California Man""Can't Find Them , Nice Move Midnight Special, And Even ""Blondie's"" Set Is MissingOne Measely Song Plus There Were Special Times When Bands Such As In 1977""The Bay City Rollers"" Had To Host The Whole Show, I As A Fan.......Would Love To Have That Complete Show Looking Perfect On DVD , You Bunch Of Idiots !!! There Are Still Alot Of Fans That Would Have Bought That Particular Episode.....Go Ruin Another DVD Package And Play It To Death At 2 Am as The Greatest Infomercial"
1,"Vain, PR opp for Zell to brag about himself","I sort of new that y'all wouldn't post my flame on Zell's ""Corp Value"". However, you should read Atlanta Creative Loafing's Online story regarding a case that Zell covered up. http://webcln.com/archives/atlanta/newstand/101098/anews.htm Zell covered for Judge Flake and former Braves Pitcher, former Sheriff Pat Jarvis. Even though Jarvis was just sentenced to 15 months in federal prison that's just the tip of the iceberg. Wrightson v. Shingler et al in on the U.S. Supreme Court docket. Soon everyone will know that this book is a farce and instead of Zell in his Marine uniform on the cover of ""Corp Values"", Zell will sport a little orange jump suit, 2 sizes too small on the cover of ""Hard Corp""! Victoria Pierce, GA Director National Alliance for Family Court Justice"
3,Tow mirror just gets by,I bought a pair of these mirrors and was less than happy with them. The instructions were hard to see on the box and they were damaged when I tightend the hardware because the holes do not live up properly. Very cheaply made. After I redrilled the holes and bought new bolts from the hardware store they tightend up better and actually work pretty good. So only get if you are willing to do extra work getting the installed properly....
3,Bummer deal,"Just a note as it is not specified anywhere on the page, there is only ONE mirror here. I thought there were two and intended to order two PAIRS of mirrors, but the price is for only one mirror."
2,don't fit,"I recieved my fender mount towing mirrors that fit all vehicles,but don't. I have a 1996 ford f350 pickup truck, the mirror mounting hardware does not open far enough to mount on my fenders. the hook on the bottom will not fit my fender openings i will have to modify the lip of my fender and the shape of the bottom hook on the mirror hardware.it will take a good bit of work to make these mirrors fit my truck"
4,Good wifi printer,"I'm pretty happy with this printer. Setup was fairly easy, printing is fast, and the (extra) double-sided printing feature works well. Double-sided printing could be faster but the rest of the printer works great. I can't vouch for photo printing on it as I've only printed written documents on standard paper."
5,Excellent read,I couldn't put this book down. I was sneaking and reading at work. The characters are like people that you know. The author is a masterful storyteller he knows how to keep the reader captivated and anticipating the next chapter. Looking forward to the next books in this series.
4,It's All About Baby !,I was so interested when I saw and read the other reviews. I did just receive my copy and love it! From the first minute we opened it my daughter was absolutely captivated by all the pictures of the babies. This is a fun book.
4,It&#65533;s All About Baby!,"After reading some of the reviews I wanted to give one. We received ours this weekend. This is the second book I've purchased from the publisher. The first one was a hardcover this one is not. I'm not sure what happened this time but I still think the book is adorable...in my copy the pictures are very clear and crisp. If you are expecting a hardcover you may be disappointed, if you can get past that... the book is cute as can be. I will be keeping mine!"
1,It's All about Baby,My granddaughter's picture is in this book. You cannot even see her face because the reproduction is so bad. Although some of the pictures are cute this book is greatly overpriced. I would not purchase a book from this group again.
4,Babies And More Cute Babies!,I think this book precious. I received our copy this week and was very pleased. We plan on buying an additional copy for the grandparents. I would also recommend it.
4,Fun!,This is the second book I have purchased from this publisher. I'm very happy with this book. It is fun and filled with very cute photos taken by amateur photographers. The concept and layout is simple....just great photos of American babies. Good Job!
4,It's All About Baby,We received our copy last week and wanted to right a review as well. We think the book is quite unique in the fact that all the photos were taken by amateurs. Most of the photos are candid and very cute. There were a couple of shots that were a bit dark in our copy. For the most part in my opinion the book is quite cute and well done.
4,Adorable Book,"I ordered the book and received it a few weeks later. What I received was a fun photography book. I loved this series of photos, filled with irresistible babies."
2,Great anticipation led to disappointment,"My daughter is on page 68,after many ""publishing problems"" I get my book and it's of the same quality as a high school yearbook.For that price,I'd think it could have been a much higher quality. It's still an honor for her to be published, but it's like expecting a swan and getting a duck."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought it because my son is in it on page 82. His picture was fine, but the book was thin, and soft covered. For $50 I was expecting a nice hard covered coffee table book. I am almost embarassed to show people. I was very excited and proud that my son was chosen,but was not happy with the end result."
4,Too Cute!,We received our books this week and love it. There are a couple of pictures that are a little too dark. I'm not sure if it was due to printing error or the picture was taken that way. Our daughter's picture printed beautifully. Thanks a bunch!
2,Unhappy!,"I was under the impression that the book would be of finest quality & hardcover, that it is not. Pictures are dark & some blurry.I also question the editing as my son is in the book on pg. 18 & his name is in reverse order with the baby sharing the page.It is a nice (cute little book) but definitely not worth $49.95."
4,It's All About Baby,Just a quick note to let everyone know I thought this book is really cute. Thanks and good job!
1,buggiest software i have ever bought,"it hangs or crashes every time i use it. the slideshow feature seems to be totally broken. when it does work, the video quality is roughly on par with a [less expensive]analog camcorder.it looks like sonic has an update on their website which may fix some of these problems. unfortunately, their product registration website is also broken so I can't download anything.mydvd 4 == total waste of [money]."
1,BAD NEWS IS RIGHT,"This program is full of bugs. The UI is actually OK, but the program just does not work. Error after error, coaster after coaster."
2,3.5GB for a 45 minute clip?,"I tested some video clips with Sonic MyDVD... but for files such as 45 minute mpeg-1 from a VCD, MyDVD required 3.5GB of data. So, each DVD can fit about 60 minute of video? That's a lot worse than the standard DVD capacity of 120 minutes per disc."
3,Better than you'd expect,"I received this camera as a free giveaway with an order I made and as such wasn't really expecting much (if it was really worth anything -or any good- they wouldn't be giving it away free now, would they?).The image quality is far from what is commonly regarded as ""professional photographic"" but for a toy of this sort it is surprisingly good.The pictures are clear, reasonably sharp and with an acceptable palette of colors. I liken it to two-strip Technicolor because of it's unusual watercolor quality.I've used several ""toy"" cameras of varying expense and quality (including one of those $25 Walmart keychain jobs)and must admit that this camera is my preferred ""toy."""
1,Sucks!,"WHen I got this camera, I was excited about being able to take pictures and videos and be able to e-mail them to my friends. The pictures won't even load onto the CD! THis is junk."
4,pleasantly nostalgic,I read the William books as a child and rereading still has the childlike humour but disciplined grammer and manners.
5,Great history,This little book had a lot of information. I saw some other books which were completely over priced. I think this one is a very good general information about the history of the pipe.
1,It is not the same item as the other VO5 Detangle & Shine!!!!!,Thought it was the same Detangle & Shine leave on conditioner as the other non-red colored bottle. It is not. Does not work anywhere as well as the other product with the same name in the other non-red colored bottle. I bought a case and am open to suggestions of what to use it for because it is not going on my head.
1,The worst!,"I like the idea of a spray and go conditioner. So convenient and quick. Well the idea is lost in this product. It does absolutely nothing and is a total waste of money. I don't know where they came up with the almost $20 price but honey, this is VO5 which is a nationally known ""bargain"" product. I think I paid $4- 6 for it a few years ago. Keep looking!Even though I got confused about the product, I still do not recommend it. It is a total waste of money!"
4,tTruly fantasy,"To whom it may concrn,My freind had gotten this software and showed me someamazing stuff. Iwas very eager to learn from him andsoon as i could contribute special effects i was on myway to software world. I had cool 3d and that was my1st encounter with software and it,s different tatics!!iI after watching and particapating with strata 3d Ithen had to go further and find more art,webpage making andendless creativity,encourage you and all to buy these products!"
4,"Come on, let's go!","Ritchie Valens tragically died at the age of 17. As such, he didn't leave a very large body of work. He left three great classic songs; ""Come On, Let's Go"", ""Donna"" and ""La Bamba"". The rest of his recorded output isn't as great as those songs, but most of it is pretty good. Who knows how much he could have accomplished if he had lived? I recommend this CD to everyone."
4,Great album,"I have been a huge fan of Ritchie's since I was a little girl and saw the movie. This album is really great and has a wonderful collection of songs, some even bring me to tears. The only downfall is that there isn't enough music on it!"
3,"A good shower head, not great.","This shower head is decent in terms of pressure and volume. The construction though, it's all plastic. I guess you won't get much in this price range, but be very careful when you install this shower head. You can damage the plastic behind the thin layer of chrome very easily. Otherwise, this shower head performs just fine. Nothing to jump out of the shower to shout about-especially with it having a trickle mode. Do people really consider a tiny trickle an actual shower mode? Really?"
3,"A little messy, but it works","Make sure you follow the instructions to a ""T"" or you could end up with face stains that are not easily removed. Go over at least twice for blond eyelashes. Open all compartments before starting, and be careful, as it can splash. They didn't make the opening of this product very easy. I did it myself, one eye at a time. Suggestion? Toss the paper eye guard they provide, it doesn't help. Use petroleum jelly and fit a piece of tissue around the area to be treated. That has been found to work better. Be meticulous with the petroleum jelly. The dye runs, so make sure the rest of your skin is protected. Barring all that, I recommend this product as opposed to going to a salon, if you are economically concerned."
1,SHIPPED OUT OF ORIGINAL BOX WITH TAPE ON BOTTLE CAPS AND NO SAFETY SEAL,"One star, as I haven't decided whether or not I will use this product. It arrived out of its original box, with TAPE (no safety seal!)around the caps of the bottles! Enclosed is a a jagged manually cut paper message--like a fortune cookie--that said ""...we have opened your item, secured all contents with tape, and folded the box...""Needless to say I am hesitant to use this product! It was shipped from ""iHeart Beauty & Fashion"" out of LA, and I cannot find them on the web.Anyone else experience this?? Should I use it?"
3,Not for dark lashesI,"It did get the lighter color tips and my lower lashes are more noticeable. Kinda messy. The little pads it comes with for under your eyes a cumbersome and hard to get under your lower lashes. If I do it again, I plan to using two pieces of masking tape with their sticky sides together so that one side has a small thin strip of stickiness to it to use. And I will use gloves. It doesn't get ALL OVER your hands but a spot or two is still too much as it doesnt wash off easily like hair dye. The instructions do warn about this. If I had blonde lashes I would love it."
5,Excellent Product,I have used this product for at least 30 years. It is wonderful and last so well. It actually makes the brows look thicker. I strongly recommend this to anyone. I am a former Cosmetology Instructor and could have used any product but chose this one.
1,Wish it did work,"I've used three time in about a month. Does a GREAT job of staining my fingers, but barely - barely makes a difference on my lashes. I was hoping for a good result. Not as good as mascara, but at least noticeable. No such luck"
2,Virtually inaccessible,"I'm certain that, buried somewhere deep in her convoluted prose, Keller has important and profound understandings to share about the nature of apocalypse. Unfortunately, this text is written in the language of a person so immersed in academia that she has forgotten how to communicate clearly and concisely to those outside of the world of research journals and symposiums. Keller's approach is to say in a paragraph what could be said in a sentence and to write with such a vocabulary that most readers will need to keep a dictionary close at hand just to decipher what she is trying to say."
1,too much,looks like a nice cart--however look at the freight--too much. $35 product--$50 plus for shipping. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for foisting this bargain off on its customers.
1,"Spend more money, get a quality pan -- This isn't it!","Ordered what I thought was a ""good"" maybe not great paella pan and at a good price. It arrived with busted welds where the handles were attached. Was a bit tricky contacting the maker for a replacement, but they did replace quickly. The new one isn't broken, but it's still a cheesy product. I guess I was expecting something a little more heavy duty than this for my $20. I'm still shopping for another one to replace this one. I will say that the size is just right for 2 people to enjoy paella, but that's the nicest thing I can say. Oh, and it's shiny too."
3,Just A Good Read!,"Just have to say that this book was a little different from the rest of the other Zane novels. Don't get me wrong though...it was still enjoyable to read. I was glued to it because I kept wondering and expecting something exciting at the end... but it wasn't all that. Just remember that when reading Zane, you have to open your mind to the possiblities of the world of erotica. Currently, I'm reading Zane's Sex Chronicles and I find these ""interesting"" short stories more enjoyable to read...One last suggestion based on experience is: if you want to finish these stories, DON'T read when your man is around because you will stop in the middle of the story... **wink..wink**:P"
1,You Can Do Better Zane,"I've read some of Zane's other books and while I don't find her to be the greatest writer, she does write entertaining stories. However this one was so poorly written. I couldn't empathize with the characters because they were so one dimensional and pathetic. The climax was ridiculous and I just felt cheated by the time the story was over. I'm glad I bought it used for under $10."
4,Kept my attention,"I was skeptical at first, thinking this would be one ghetto a$$ book, but I was surprised to find out that it had interesting twists and kept me reading to the finish. I did however enjoy the sex tips at the end a lot better than the actual story. I liked that Zane made some of her characters educated/rich instead of everyone struggling to get out of the slums. I enjoyed the richness of each character b/c they all brought something to the picture. Diana's story gave me hope. Single mother of two in search of love, but afraid to get involved at the risk of being hurt. But she ended up with a good man in the end."
2,I Don't Know What's Up With Zane Anymore,"I believe that Zane has fell off. I don't know what she is writitng anymore. Its like she got her props and she doesn't want to stick to writing quality books anymore. The storylines are like whatever.Being that this story was set around Christmas, I wasn't too crazy about that and her little presents at the end of the book was like a waste of pages. I really don't know why people still like her because what she is distributing is just of waste of ink, paper and time. I still read her books to see if she is going to bring back her formula. I only purchased one of her book and I never purchased another since."
2,so far my least favorite zane novel,"i read zane's book just for the fun of it and of course the juicy sex scenes she is famous for writing. this book was a complete let down. it had a few interesting twists although they were somewhat predictable. the sex scenes were pathetic. i read it fairly quickly, but only because i was hoping it was going to get better and not because it was such a page turner. zane's book are hit or miss for me. she has done a good job with most of her books by including a good story along with the trashiness we all secretly love, but this book had no good storyline and no good trash to girltalk to your friends about. this has probably been my least zane novel by a landslide."
1,Absolute Rubbish!!!,"This is my 2nd Zane book and it will definetly be my last, I have never experienced such bad writing, bad plots and totally unrealistic situations. The first book I read (so bad I can't even remember the name) was going to be my last Zane book. I ended up reading this one because it was sent to me by BlackExpressions and I never returned it. I thought I'd give her another try... WRONG MOVE!!! I'm not sure who her audience is, but I won't be spending good money on another of her books. P.S. could someone please explain why the ""bonus section"" was necessary, what did it have to do with anything?"
1,Shocked,"I love ZANE, but this is her worst in my opinion. I was so excited when I recieved it. I hated it. I liked the tips at the end though."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I didn't enjoy this book at all I bought it because my husband and I own a small book club and our readers were asking for it. Being a reader myself I was curious to find out why the sudden demand for the book.I still don't get it beause I thought the book was awful.The storylines were very weak and the language was quite vulgar. I'm no prude and don't have any great objection to some degree of profanity in books but this was just too much.The sex scenes were non descriptive and vulgar.I thought the book gave a very negative view of african americans and I still don't understand why people would want to read stories like this.I think that erotic stories for black people can be written in a more tasteful manner,and still leave you in no doubt that it is a story for a predominantly black readership.I think Zane can do a better job than this."
4,So much Drama!,"Now this book was a little different, about a high class hoe that was cheating on her husband when she had the world in her hands. People just don't see when they have it good, until its to late. I am glass Tomalis got rid of his wife (...) the way he did, especially after sexin dirty Donald, and Bradford his right hand man. Great book!"
4,Different but Good,This book was different from any other book by Zane that I've read. It wasn't as erotic as I expected but I still enjoyed it.
1,Note to self: Don't Ever Do that Again!,"I read this book because I'd heard so many good things about Zane. I won't repeat all of the other reviewers word for word, but my goodness, the characters had NO depth, no spirit, no nothing (Oh, except for consistently stimulated genitals and a lack of self-respect)! Now, I know that it's nearly impossible to tell a story that hasn't been told before, but I was predicting this story before its ending and even when things started happening, I was yawning. It was WAY too predictable, boring, diluted(...). I'll never pick it--or any other Zane novel for that matter--up again. It doesn't deserve one star, maybe .5 stars for it being printed."
5,Skyscraper,Great book. I haven't figured out the title yet. I started it yesterday and hope to finish it today.
2,Jane's Skyscraper,"This book was okay.....it's nothing to write home about. For something that was supposed to be erotic, it was all but that. Yes, there was some interesting parts, but this book didn't meet my expectations. Yes, I would recommend this book to others; maybe for a little suspense or for some who likes to read about everyone else's drama.....but erotic is far fetched."
3,Interesting book,"The book kept my interest. It did not blow me away, but I would read the book again. The story is about Chico, Anastasia, Tomalis, and Diana in an office building. Each character is going through something that could impact their careers and lives. Out of all the characters the two I would love to see another book on would be Diana and Edmund. Especially Edmund. The story was cool though."
2,Very disappointed,"I usually enjoy Zane's novels, but Skyscraper felt very rushed. The characters were undeveloped and boring. The ending was anticlimatic and slow. Hopefully the next novel will be better."
3,Pay Back Is A Mutha!,"I picked up this read from my neighborhood library, Wolfe Industries a well know automobile manufacture owned by Tomalis Wolfe, this novel is constructed around characters that are employed at Wolfe Industies. The mail cherk Chico to the office whore Anastasia, office affairs and new found love and a big twist of payback. All and all this novel was just ok."
4,I loved this book,This book captured my attention anf I couldn't put it down once I started. It's a real page-turner. A lot of drama and twists and turns. Zane does it again. Highly recommended.
4,HMM!!,"I MUST SAY, WHEN I FIRST READ THIS BOOK, I WAS LOOKING FOR THE ZANE I KNEW FROM HER OTHER BOOKS.IT WAS GOOD, BUT LACKS THE USUAL OVER THE TOP EXCITEMENT IN A ZANE BOOK.MAYBE NEXT TIME!"
3,Bright but no Xenon,"I bike to and from work most days and bought this light for those dark nights when I work late. While it is brighter than a lot of other choices out there it definitely doesn't turn a dark road into a well-lit one.The biggest flaw with this light is that it puts out a very, very bright center spot and a fairly weak corona around this small spot. When biking along the corona simply doesn't give you enough visibility to see an object in the road with a lot of time to avoid it.Thankfully I bike somewhere that has enough ambient light from street lights that I don't have a lot of dark spots to worry about, but if that isn't you, spend more money to get a more powerful light."
2,Not worth the money.,"This light is decent if you want to be seen at night. If you expect to be able to see anything with it, you'll be sorely disappointed.If you want to actually go down dark trails in pitch black darkness, see trust me, spend the extra money and buy a P7-C (Google it). For just a few bucks more, the difference is unbelievable."
4,Nice but narrow light!,"I bought this unit because it is quite bright and it mounts on my unusual wing-shaped and wide handlebars. I like it, but the light beam is really narrow. If you aim it 7 to 10 feet in front of you, the illumination is a bright two foot circle of light and a dim glow out from that point. I'd prefer a wider (though fainter) beam... or a more gradual diffusion of light, starting bright in the center and growing dimmer... gradually... as it works farther away from the center.The light is functional, doesn't weigh too much and is easy on batteries (so far... I've only used it for four hours!). Mounting works well, but the set screw for the left-right adjust on the bracket was too loose.Unit vibrates a little, but not too bad. Only other annoyance is light reflection off my brake cable. I have to tie it back with a velcro strip when I want to use the light."
1,Great until it breaks. Not very rugged,The battery connectors and housing are flimsy and poorly designed. Works great until it breaks or an electrical connection sticks open or closed.
2,needs a better attachment for a light this expensive,"The light works fine, but the attachment bracket is weak and wont last. Mine broke after about 6months of use.I was moving the light from one bike to another. I am disappointed. Not a good buy.Look at the picture and you can see there is a flexible plastic strap with threads. Well, after a while the plastic is not so flexible. and snap. Your bike light just turned into a flash light.You can buy a replacement strap for 5$. Or spend your money on a different light, many Cateye lights have this attachment method though, so look closely at the picture."
4,Great light easily broken,I used this light for a year and it has very good lighing and battery life.The light is very easy to break. It fell from my coat pocket and does not work any more. The problem is in the head of the light and there is no way to open and fix that part of the light. The light didn't even fall far enough to break the plastic shell.
4,Excellent inexpensive light,"Adequate for before-sunrise bike rides; also bright enough to be identified by vehicles and pedestrians. Only limitation is the limited spread of the light beam, for trail curves & corners. Batteries have lasted for 2 seasons of 50 to 75 hour+ rides."
3,Good but Unreliable,"The light is bright and easy to use, perfect for riding on the street and paved trails at low speeds. It can be seen by oncoming traffic.A simple on/off switch works well until it fails. I have had two of these switches fail prematurely. I will not buy another with this switch design."
5,Pollen ROCKS!,"While Co-Ed is well worth the listen, Pollen is well worth the wait! As each of their songs end and the next begins, their half of the split gets better and better. Do yourself a favor and check this out."
2,I think this ground has been covered....,While Co-Ed try their hardest I just get the feeling I've heard this before. Pollen however show no originality and were incredibly predictable and blander than concrete mix. Attitude has nothing to do with musical ability(or inability in pollen's case) The two stars were for Co-Ed.
1,no matting,"Decent frame, but I figured it would come with matting for a 5x7 picture as the picture on the site implies. It doesn't. Buyer beware so you don't waste time and $ like I did."
5,Solid product,"The frame is constructed well and of good quality materials, at a decent price. The design is basic, so it looks good just about anywhere."
3,A nice TV play -- but an American James Bond??,"An interesting TV play of the early 1950s. Barry Nelson as James Bond - an American James Bond, no less. Ian Fleming must have really needed the money so he could write more Bond novels. Why else would he sell his rights to his fascinating story, only to have it end up as a live television play on American TV? It's a must-have for the true Bond collector. This is the only serious rendering of the novel ""Casino Royale"" available, and it doesn't closely resemble the novel either."
5,The Original Bond was CIA not MI6,"This rare collector's edition is one to watch before the 2006 release of new James Bond Daniel Craig. Originally he was an American named Jimmy and its just not the same. Bond is blue blood British just as Ian Fleming imagined. Nonetheless, it's a cool rendition from the cold war era of 1954. Must see for true blue Bond fans. So NO ... Dr. No was no the first 007 movie to be made from the series."
2,CasinoRoyal,"I didn't realize this wasn't a full length movie, the title was miss leading (Collector's Edition - not ""TV Version"") This was the orginal one hour televised play version of the book. The quality of the footage was poor due to the technology of it's day. It was insightful how ""Bond"" has evolved over the years. I found it interesting but disappointed it wasn't an orginal full length movie of the book."
3,For Bond historical buffs and a look at the golden age of television,"In 1954 CBS had a live dramatic show called ""Climax"". This adaptation of Ian Fleming's ""Casino Royale"" is the first video attempt to bring James Bond to life. In this story, Bond is ""Jimmy"" (Barry Nelson) and is an American! AND Clarence (not Felix) Leiter (Michael Pate) is a Brit. How confusing is that.The Russian bad guy here, played by the great Peter Lorre, must win back all the money he lost in the Monte Carlo casino or risk trouble with the Ruskie government. Bond's assignment is to stop him from winning which he manages to do. Le Chiffre (Lorre) doesn't like that much so tortures Bond to get the money back. The TV show runs 50 minutes with no commercials.This is all petty lame compared to modern Bond films, and is fodder only for Bond historical buffs and those who want to get a peek at TV in the ""golden age"". Like me."
5,A RARE TREAT TO FIND,THIS HAS BEEN OUT OF PRINT AND UNAVAILABLRE FOR YEARS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT IS AVAILABLE ON DVD. THESE ARE A RARE FIND AND VERY HARD TO FIND FOR THESE ARE AGAIN - OUT OF PRINT ! A TRUE COLLECTOR'S DREAM ~
3,For the fan,"the actual film is a recording of a life televised play. Consequently not the Bond spectacular you are acustomed to. It also airs the time when it was recorded. Slow-ish. Still, it completes my Bond collection and the picture and sound quality was good to very good, considering the age. So, yes I am pretty happy with this addition to the collection and, no I probably won't watch it a second time. But I will be showing it off.I certainly satisfied my need-to-know what it was I never saw before."
3,Casino Royale,I was a little disappointed in the quality of the television picturepart of the video but I do realise that it is from 1954 so have allowed forthat in my rating. I also realise that I wouldn't have had the opportunityto see this TV program without this video so the overall rating is in itsfavour rather than against it.
5,in great shape!,"this is a great way to get a book for less! And it was in great shape. No bends, tares or writing in it! Great value!"
4,Wow!,"This is a really incredible book! I have enjoyed reading real-life love stories for a long time, but most of them were short online articles. This is a wonderful BOOK! I was so excited when I heard about it that I immediately requested it at our library.I was a little uncomfortable with the beginning of the book, which is the reason that I gave this incredible book only four stars. I guess I'm pretty sheltered from the world --- the references to having sex/love-making and the locker-talk were just... uncomfortable for me. I enjoyed the book, though, and would recommend it to anyone! It's incredible to see the way God works in the lives of Eric and Leslie. I can't wait to find a copy of this book within my price range so that I can add it to my personal shelf!"
1,A dry writing exercise and a tremendous disappointment.,"I devour well-written books about restaurants, hotels, department stores, and this is the first time I felt the author had no interest in writing the book, other than that someone told him he should. Perhaps one of those memoir-writing students.The sentence structure is of the ""See Dick run."" complexity and depth. An appalling lack of descriptives, and absolutely no lyricism, nor romance in the writing - nor is it a hard-core expose - which then would at least have a sense that the author cared about writing the story. This is the book I would have written about my travels...which is why I have not written it, as it would be as lacking in its ability to convey a richness of experience."
4,greatbook,I've stayed in the michealangelo several times and this is such a great description of the hotel and nyc.
3,Paper Weight.,"I bought this router because it was heavily discounted down to $20. I got it set up and running and everything seemed fine. Yesteday however I started getting dropped connections to my DSL system about every 30sec to 2 minutes. My MSN messaging system detects this and I see it trying to reconnect. It would reconnect automatically but it is irritating to have to wait for the connection to start working. To test, I re-connected my PC directly to the DSL modem, rebooted, and sure enough all the problems went away. I did not use the wireless option at all. It did work well for networking my two PC's together with it's 4 RJ45 Ethernet connections on the back."
5,personal/universal,"""Armchair Cogitations"" continues in the apparently semi-autobiographical vein of ""Pathways"", Herbert Kaufman's previous book. The section ""Air Force Vignettes"", especially, provides a glimpse into a world that, in some ways, no longer exists. However, just when you think that a piece is going to be primarily nostalgic in nature, an event or conversation between characters shifts the emphasis. Often we understand then that the relationships between humans broadly follow along certain well-worn paths; what may appear as our own original, highly personal drama is part of an existence common to all of us. Perhaps the reader's age will, in part, determine the extent to which he or she may empathize with some of the book's characters and situations, but there is much that all will recognize."
4,Great for beginners,This is a nice little book for your Maltese library. Beginners with this breed will learn a lot. The grooming section was not quite as up-to-date as I had hoped for. Other than this I enjoyed reading it.
4,Good book for beginners,"I own several Maltese books. The essential Maltese is the best book in it's price range. I felt it was very breed specific compared to other similar series. I hate getting cookie cutter breed books. For those who aren't that intestested in breed history, showing and kennels or spending $20+ this is a really good buy. The pictures are excellent as well."
3,Terry Garr appearance,"This episode ""Assignment Earth"" should have been included in the Star Trek collection on time travel as it is a good one. Besides it has a very early appearance by Terry Garr. It was also done with the idea of a spinoff series."
3,Mr. Scruff and Moondog cross referred,"Right here on Amazon.com, if you look up Moondog, you are cross-referred to Mr. Scruff. And vice versa. Which is interesting because:When I first heard the melody in use in 2002 for Lincoln Town Car TV commercials, I recognized the melody (at least I think I did) as ""Bird's Lament,"" a Moondog melody originally reocrded by him in the late '60s for Columbia, now on the CD Moondog, also on Columbia, and rerecorded by him on Atlantic a few years ago as ""sax pax for a sax.""Moondog was blind, died a few years ago. The Mr. Scruff single CD does not credit Moondog (Louis Hardin) for the tune so is it a coincidence as with George Harrison and ""My Sweet Lord""/""He's so Fine""? It seems to credit someone named Carthy. So I dunno. I'd love to hear more about this. Maybe it's a puzzle meant to be solved."
1,Does not work,"This is supposed to melt ice next to the wire. Mine does not do this. Unfortunately, I was slow in installing this and missed the return window."
3,winter,"i have not turn this on, the winter in the northeast was mild and had no problems on the roof this time. this is why i rated it as 3 stars, shipment and price was as expected, no problems. i did not run it on the roof i ran it in the downsputs and gutter had one on the roof all ready"
5,Great Football Storyline & Good Use of Creative Acronyms,"I really enjoyed this book - couldn't put it down. The heroine is always getting in trouble. Jessica is a realistic person with realistic looks - not one of your beautacious and buxom characters. Ty is a great leading character. At first he seems your average good looking, football jock. But there is a lot more to him. He is a sweet, romantic soul. I love the play on words that the author incorporates into the story. Her use of creative acronyms keeps you guessing throughout the whole book."
2,Ghost Wrestlers,"The plot is basic but it also rip-off other shows like The Real Ghostbusters,remember the ghost-hunting tools that they were using that shoted out silly-putty? They also rip-off Scooby-Doo when They find out that the ghost is a villain in a monster costume. The jokes are still cheesy & phone in a mile away. The ending is predictable. I give this ""rent me"" a 3 out of 10."
5,"I would love to read the book, but can't find it",Does anyone know how to get ahold of this book. I hear its great and should read it. Please contact me at SLOMS@aol.com Thank you
4,A great review of birth (and death?) of modern surfing,The book takes you on a journey of the evolution of surfing and the surfing industry as seen by one man. In the end I didn't know whether to envy Mike Doyle for the care free life he leads or to feel sorry for him becuase of it. I guess both. I enjoyed every page.
4,Berlin point of view,"If you love to surf more than being seen or watched in or out the water, you'll like the book. It gets the 4 stars, because of its soul character."
1,Does not fit!,"Pulley was not right for my vehicle. I was able to return, but had to pay for freight both ways."
5,Much more than music,"This is an audiovisual experience, with a concert supplemented by computer graphics and other special effects. The cover says it was designed to induce altered consciousness, and I think it succeeds. This is an awesome movie, I highly recommend it. There's much more here than just a concert video. Buy this now! I wish it were around on DVD."
4,Great music and graphics,"The concert and staged band footage offers energetic playing by all of the Dead. Although the graphics are absolutely great, in fact they're fantastic, I found that I (personally) would have liked more footage of the Dead playing and a bit less graphics. I haven't timed it, but it seems to me that the actual band footage is quite a bit less than half the movie. My only complaint. I'd buy it again. You should buy it too."
3,FISHY,I HAVEN'T TRIED IT JET BECAUSE I HAVE TO ORDER THE GARD FOR IT ITS GETS TO HOT..I GUESS .SO I WILL ORDER THAT STEAL GARD
3,Alied floating de-icer,"The items arrived on time and in good shape. However, the ad says nothing about needing an optional guard to use it in a non-metallic pond(Who has a metal pond?). This had to be ordered separately from another retailer and this took another 2 weeks. I do not recommend this item if you must use it in a mall space as the guard is HUGE."
2,tank heater,"Add for heater does not say that it can not be adjusted for thermostat.The temperature settings are set to go on at 40Degrees, I needed a setting higher but could not adjust. Cannt be returned. Not worth buying."
5,the best STOCK TANK de-icer for the price,"This is a terrific product. I have used stock TANK de-icers from 5 different manufacturers, many at 3 times the price of this one. It is sturdy and it works as well as any of them. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,problems with its longevity,I bought this second one in an emergency because the first one i bought the heating element burnt out after 2 months.This one lasted only one week!Both in an outside pond about 10 feet by 4 feet and 2 feet in depth - at temperatures about 10 to 40 degrees fahrenheit.I think it is a lack of control of the heater element temperatureTry a different manufacturer!
2,Not adjustable as stated in the product description.,"This heater kicks on when the water gets down to 40 degrees. As far as i can tell, it' can't be adjusted to keep the water any warmer. Not meant to heat the pond to a comfortable temp for fish. It just keeps a hole in the ice for gasses to escape, fine for kio, not fine for goldfish."
4,Working so far - Draws a lot of Power,"The Allied Precision 7521 pond de-icer is keeping my koi pond clear so far. No complaints. I did have to change where it was plugged in because the power draw is so heavy that it trips my circuit breaker. Not a huge deal, just something good to be aware of."
1,great for horses.,"Only when this heater arrived are you informed that it may melt the sides of your pond if the pond is not made of metal.How many of you have metal fish ponds?You can buy a safety guard for the heater to protect the sides of the pond or you can simply place a 2by4 across the pond to prevent the heater from touching the sides.This product gets hot enough to melt all ice in the pond. This is not necessary for your Koi.The pond heater is designed for horse traughs, not for fish ponds."
4,"Well Okay, this may not be his best work .","Even though this album has been given some terrible reviews It still diserves at least 4 stars. If you have never heard Junior before than this Cd is probably not for you. But, if you are a hard-core Jonior fan than this will make an interesting adition to you collection. Okay, with the exeption of the title track the audio quality is terrible. But, I listen to guys like Blind Lemon Jefferson, Son House and Charly Patton so much that this doesn't bother me. Plus, if you hate the first 4 tracks, the live tracks will more than make-up for that. In the last four tracks have a lot of screaming fans and guitar feed back. On the last track you can hear Junior thanking his fans and unplugging his guitar. Plus it even has a small clip of Stevie Ray Vaunghn at the end. This May sound silly but if you close you Eyes and use your imagination, it is almost like you are at the concert."
1,Breaks soon after opening,"I bought two of these controllers at the same time. I only opened one of them at first, and it broke within a month. When I opened the second one, it broke within three days. Both of them broke in the exact same place: the left analog stick. The plastic that holds the left analog stick in place is just not strong enough. These are pretty controllers though."
2,Mistake to buy Dream Gear,"I bought a sister model to this controller and it broke shortly after I opened the package. Dream Gear was totally non-responsive to my inquiries for help.I have learned that as much as I hate to pay extra, the Sony models last forever and stand up to the beating kids are likely to give a Playstation controller."
5,A Great Planning Tool,"This Trails Illustrated map is a great tool for initial planning of your adventure into the Grand Canyon's spectacular backcountry. The map covers Grand Canyon National Park backcountry in its entirety. Almost. But close enough for most. The 1:73,530 scale and 80' contour interval make this map of limited use for on trail use, but make useful for getting an overview of the canyon and a sense of your options.This map is also packed with information useful for planning your Grand Canyon trip. Backcountry use areas, necessary for making a permit request, are designated on the map. So are camp sites, campgrounds, and water sources in the GC's backcountry.Very handy."
2,A Fair Trail Map,"There's nothing particularly wrong with this map, it's just hard to make sense of. I much prefer theGrand Canyon Trail Map. Se my review of the other map"
4,"If not hell,close to it",I've run & biked (slowly) over the cobblestones in many areas of europe & they don't seem dangerous until a little slick. Made me appreciate the dangers the racers face when the conditions get bad & they have to go forward.
2,rotting straps,These work great on the short term but by second season pulling my trailer the rubber straps were shot. I made my own and the mirrors can still be used. At current sale price they are probably worth the money but be prepared to modify the straps or throw them away in a year or so
1,CHEAP CHEAP,HAD IT ALL OF FIVE MINS. WHILE INSTALLING IT ON MY TRUCK THE CHEAP ADJUSTABLE CLIP BROKE. WHN I PICKED IT UP OFF DRIVE WAY PLASTIC TAB WAS SO THIN. ITS FRI. NIGHT OF PRES. DAY WEEKEND AND I HAV THREE DAYS OF HAULING MY TOYHAULER WITH NO ADD A MIRROR. DO NOT BUY. CAN NOT BELIEVE I WAITED A WEEK FOR IT TO GET HERE.
1,Not for a dodge,"Quality and construction were not an issue as these appear to be well made. They are the only mirrors listed specifically as fitting the Dodge Dakota with the 5 X 7 sport mirror. Essentially these added nothing to the viewable area so what I need to see, the area behind the trailer, I still could not see. The fit was great and it was easy to clip them, but the factory Dodge mirrors don't stick out far enough from the truck to make these useful."
2,No good enough,"I bought a pair and returned them after a 1000 mile trip:Problems:1. The clips can get in the way of the truck mirror. Only one can work at a time, the clip mirror or the truck mirror.2. Begin to shake at 45 Mph. The mirror image becomes blurred. Also the wind can change the angle that you set when the truck is not moving."
4,good product,hubby loves it on his f150 1997 fits good use on regular basic. on highway so its been very well tested.so we give it thumps up!!!
5,School Services Sourcebook,This book is great for brief descriptions of multiple interventions to be used in schools.
5,Close your eyes,"to capture the true beauty of the instrument and the man. I can feel the sun shining, the wind blowing and the buffalo roaming. A true native artist who doesn't compromise his sound."
2,For the very eclectic only,"An unaccompanied solo player of a single pipe playing tunes, with a background of birds singing, a crackling fire, or other natural sounds. Some unaccompanied vocal solos. The pieces all seem the same and are quite alien and not pleasant to an untrained Western ear. Only for the die hard enthusiast."
5,BEYOND ZEN,"I ORIGINALLY SAW ADYASHANTI'S BOOKS AND CD'S IN A SOUNDS TRUE CATALOG. I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS MATERIALS THAT ARE IN PRINT AND OFFERED HERE AT AMAZON. THIS PARTICULAR BOOK ""THE IMPACT OF AWAKENING"" HAS NOW BEEN READ TWICE BY ME AND I'M SURE I'LL COME BACK TO IT A THIRD TIME...IT IS THOUGHT PROVOKING AND MAKES ME QUESTION MANY OF THE TRADITIONALLY HELD IDEAS AND BELIEFS I HAVE HELD TIGHTLY. THE READING REQUIRES A LOT OF ""STILLNESS"" AND ""LETTING GO""...SOMETHING I AND MANY OTHERS ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO..."
3,Six of the eight were intact.,"When the package arrived, two of the eight boxes were cracked. At least the other six boxes were still intact."
3,Tapes,bought these for extra recording I am now secretary of my organization and hope to keep up with the notes
4,Good tapes,"Wife is a songwriter and needed some tapes for her portable machine for putting down thoughts and melodies as they come to her. Had trouble finding tapes in stores so Amazon to the rescue. We bought enough to last until she's 100 or so, so shouldn't run out.Good tapes, would recommend."
5,Great!,"i bought this for my mom and she went crazy when she saw them! they work very good and i had no problems with them, they arent too big but hold a lot, very happy with this order, would buy again."
3,so-so,The first package came with one tape missing. I had to send it back and I was sent a new package. But by the time I got them it was too late to use them for my project.
3,"They say ""you get what you pay for"" ...","And in this case it's true. Not expensive, but not worth very much if you value high quality sound. The tapes recorded only a fair quality for me, and if that's all you need then this is a good choice for the price."
4,I was surprised,"My car is old enough not to have a CD player in it but it does have a decent cassette player. I decided to make some music tapes for it but none of the local stores carried any blank cassette tapes. So I ordered them from Amazon. When I made the tapes they played back great, I haven't heard any hiss or noise and the frequency response is great. I was pleasantly surprised."
1,Drags galore,"Recorded 3 out of 24 tapes. All 3 drag at some point. You have to record completly before you know if they are bad.Seller offered to replace ANY that were bad. I will NOT record 24 sixty minute tapes and then listen to see if each one drags. I do not blame the seller, but I won't purchase any more 8 pack MAXELL 60 MINUTE TAPES."
5,perfect!,"Exactly as described, 8 pack of cassettes for a decent price.Work great, came in undamaged, no complaints!Now time to make some awesome cassette tapes."
5,Maxells Are Great Tapes,"These Maxell tapes did what I needed them to do, and I used them at school and was able to record a few final exam and midterm reviews because of these."
3,Premise=good. Book=bad.,"Short stories are Mr. Self's forte. Novels? Not too hot. This one is an example of what happens when he has pages to waste. He meanders into areas that don't best serve his purpose. He fills with toilet humor and shows a fascination for bodily fluids that most outgrow at puberty. If he was to eliminate references to the bodily functions this book would be half it's size. I can't even finish it. I enjoy his work, and bits of his fantastic ideas shine through. Not enough to warrant reading though. He seems to be torn between being an intelluctual Planet of the Apes and a pre-teen laughing at the monkeys at the zoo. Seems he took the easy route. Shame."
5,Tremendously entertaining,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was clever and fun. I loved the concept of chimpanzees driving around London. The wild humans are described as looking something like Homer Simpson. The middle third of the book was occassionally a little slow-going - but ultimately this book was gratifying in both humorous and serious senses.
4,An Education,"Self is often unfairly criticised for his complex, verbose prose: contrary to what others would have you believe, his style does not detract from the flow of Great Apes, nor does it impede the process of imagination. Reading Self, especially his early work, is an education; an opportunity to improve your vocabulary and to take advantage of a skewed individual's unique perception of what has limped forth from the societal soup.However, Great Apes is much, much more than an academic exercise. It is a, too often, disturbing allegory of the superficial nature of constructed culture and manufactured reality. It illuminates just how fragile our cosy and insular existences might be - presenting a perspective that is a little too genetically familiar for comfort."
4,untitled,"will self writes contemporary fiction in a way which is reminiscent of more traditional philosophic thought, but with the freedom of language we are able to experience today. He follows the story of simon dykes, surrealistic artist, through his ""ape delusion."" the most effective aspect of the story is will self's ability to make you question: is the delusion truly a delusion, or are we merely apes playing the role of humans ourselves?"
4,Not your father's Gulliver's Travels,"One of the funniest, most dazzling linguistic and intellectual displays I've read in years. Self's gleefully coprolalic, vertiginously fluid command of the English language recalls Joyce; his skillfully wrought satiric vision, Swift or perhaps Vonnegut. He takes what seems to be a simple conceit--what if chimpanzees had become the dominant culture instead of humans?--and uses it to explore and to challenge our cherished notions of what makes us human. I wasn't completely satisfied with the ""cute"" ending, though (and this book is definitely NOT one to recommend to polite company; e.g., anyone whose idea of social satire is Jane Austen). From prose rhythm to prodigious vocabulary, Self pays attention to the little things that separate literature from beach reading (though I'll admit I did read this on the beach, and guffawed loudly enough to scare off many flocks of seagulls)."
4,brilliant,There really isn't too much to add to what others have said in reviewing the book. This is a world weary cynical satire of human life which is one of the funniest things I have read in years. Having said that boy oh boy does it make you think. As I read about life through the eyes of a chimp that which is initially hysterically funny becomes less so when you realise what you are reading parallels aspects of your own life.Despite my review seeming somewhat contradictory in its 'effulgence' of this book I would recommend it to anyone and all my friends have had it for Christmas or a birthday and now they are passing it on to others.
1,I just don't have the stomach for this book!,"I looked forward to reading this book after I heard the author interviewed on NPR's ""To the Best of Our Knowledge."" I thought it sounded like a fun and interesting premise.I almost never stop reading a book, most books have SOMETHING to keep me interested. I just don't have the stomach for this book and will not finish reading it."
4,A [mostly] superb novel.,"""Great Apes"" was a great read from the English master of satire Will Self, and I was not at all disappointed. The book truly deserves 4.5 stars. It is not the best novel ever-- most chapters are pretty readable, but some parts seem to go so slowly that it almost gets unreadable. But the parts where Self is obviously at his best make up for everything. The novel seems to be getting mixed reviews, and I understand why (Self's apparent fixation with a certain part of the body, perahps?). However, whether you liked or disliked the book isn't the question. But if you can't appreciate the point Will Self was making, watch out; and hope you don't wake up to find yourself surrounded by some great apes."
3,"Underneath the cleverness, a mediocre story","Whilst Mr. Self has done well to imagine such a fantasy world (completely fantastic, why would chimps live in houses for a start?), once one tires of this device, there is really nothing more than a competent story behind it. An enjoyable read, all the same."
4,Wicked Pissah,"This one had me sitting in my driveway for 30 minutes listening, as my baby slept in the back seat.loved it."
3,Drop Shot,"I just finished this book, and enjoyed it, but it was not up the Harlan's usually high standards. I agree with another review who said that there were places in the book that could have been ""cut & pasted"" from some of Harlan's other books. Again, the conversational writing is tremendous, and most of all ""true to life"". The characters seem to come to life and do in fact have their individual personalities. Not his best, but worth reading."
4,Myron BoliStar,"I will agree with the review that said that the ending was disappointing, in that it was predictable. However, I still feel it was a good book. I really enjoy the characters. They remind me a lot of Robert Crais's Elvis Cole and Joe Pike and that isn't a bad thing. I would recommend this book but for someone that is going to read only one Harlan Coben book you should still go with Fade Away. That one and Dealbreaker were definitely sure things."
3,"Not Coben's best, but still fun","This book suffers from a predictible ending, unlike Coben's other books"
1,boring,"I am a tennis fan and was attracted by the title. The plot seems very shallow, no charactor development to remember and quite unrealistic. $0.25 at the book store. worth the money. Not worth the time Hard to follow who is who. More like a Japanese play. Skip to the last chapter in order to fathom the plot and then go back to the beginning if you like. Really."
4,The Second Myron Bolitar Story Does Not Disappoint,"Duane Richwood is an up-and-comer on the tennis circuit and also Myron's client. Valerie Simpson is the opposite, a down-and-outter, has-been, washed up former tennis ace. What could these two possibly have in common? When Valerie is shot while Duane is playing at the US Open and then the cops come a knockin' on Duane's door, Myron decides he had better find out, and fast.Once again, Coben does not disappoint with Drop Shot.Win is edgy as always, Esperanza is the same smart mouth I have come to know and love and Myron is a guy you just can't help rooting for. There is loads of good storytelling in this book and just when you think you have part of the mystery solved, Coben crafts a new angle and throws a monkey wrench smack dab in the middle of it."
4,Good - Fun reading,"Although some parts of this book seem more than far fetched, it is very well done and fun reading. Myron Bolitar is not your average hero, nor is his friend Win but it is an enjoyable book to read and not easy to figure out until the end."
4,wish it wasn't abridged - great story and i wanted to hear the whole thing.,wish it wasn't abridged - great story and i wanted to hear the whole thing.
3,Not as good as others,"If Myron Bolitar doesn't stop soon, he won't have a single client left; at least that's the impression I'm left with after reading this novel. No, it's not a spoiler, but the character does have a habit of pissing off the people he's supposed to be helping.I've just started reading through the Bolitar series, and I'm hoping the next one continues with better twists and turns (Unfortunately, I figured out the big twist several chapters before Myron did. Boo.) and significantly less Jessica."
3,Solid shot,"This second installment in the Myron Bolitar series is another solid entry, though not as riveting as the first book. Myron's dry wit makes the story more interesting and continues to be the draw for me.I didn't think Win could get scarier but he pulls out the stops in this story. There are some tense moments but for the most part, this was more of a puzzler than suspense. There were several subplots that converged at the end, which kept my interest level high. I was able to figure out most of the main plot but admit I was caught off guard with one of the other diversions.I'm hooked on Myron and this series and will be continuing. My rating for this story is 3.5 stars."
5,Check Out This Little Unknown Author,"I've read 3 of the ""Myron Bolitar Mysteries"" during the past month...what fun! The story lines are very well written; a page-turner filled with intrigue and lots of laughs! I can't wait to read another."
2,Rather obvious little mystery centered on pro tennis,While the writer does an okay job moving along his story the solution to the 'mystery' was easily discerned several chapters before our hero managed to stumble upon it. Rather confused as to why this author is so popular. IMHO good only for passing time in airports or on trains.
4,"Not as good as Deal Breaker, but still great!","I read this book in one day, and it was great. But at this point I expect as much from Harlan Coben. Drop Shot was not as excellent as Deal Breaker, and I had the ending figured out before Myron. But none the less it is still an exciting, suspensful, and funny novel. I recommend it. And I have already picked up Myron's next adventure, the Edgar award winning Fade Away. I can't wait to get started.If you pick up this book, which you should, enjoy! :)"
2,"Looks nice, but can't keep time","The clock looks great hanging on my office wall, but it can't keep time at all. I set it 18 hours ago and it's already 7 minutes fast. also, when the minute hand is at 12, the hour hand isn't even 3/4 of the way to the next hour."
3,"Looks cheap, not bad for the price though","Bought this for the price. Some reviews said it takes 2 batteries, mine only takes one. Also, other reviews say the don't hear any ticking....I hear ticking. Not too thrilled about that, but it's not the end of the world. It's fairly cheap looking. The print on it is a bit more yellow than I thought. I don't hate it though, it's just OK. Lets see how long this sucker lasts...."
4,Wall Clock,"I was pretty much depending on the clock on my microwave. Well, I gave that microwave away and was using my wristwatch. Saw this wall clock and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. It looks great on my wall, and seems to keep good time. I've only had it for a short while, but for the price, I can't complain. I wish it had a second hand though. I guess I can live with that. All in all, a great clock!"
2,A time that won't last.,"I recieved a very nice vintage looking yellow faced clock to put in my garden. After a month I had to reset a lingering time, after two months I had to do it again. It's now over three months and the slow old yellow faced clock is looking blue, litterally. The yellow faded to blue. Now I have an old Blue clock that can't keep up. What can you do...?"
2,Second hand defective,"The clock was ok, but when placed on the wall, the second hand kept dropping. I just set it again with the time at 4:35. It is now 5:02 and the clock says 4:42, with a new battery. Will be returning."
1,Does not keep time,Do not buy this clock. I have put a new battery in twice over the past two hours and it does not keep time. The cost to ship back is almost as much as the clocks value. Do yourself a favor and buy a clock at a store where you can easily take it back if need be.
1,JUNK!!!!!,Cheaply made of plastic. A single AA battery to run a substandard clock movement. One of the worst products I have even purchased via Amazon. Clock never worked and returned it to Amazon ASAP.Save your money and look elsewhere. This manufacturer aspires to improve its products to a sub-par level.....JUNK!!! 1-star is too many.
1,Don't buy this clock,The first clock I received came with the glass broken. The replacement had a crack in the case and the dials did not line up with the numbers correctly. The clock is probably OK but the packaging will not protect this fragile item. I will fix the last one myself or toss it and get one from WallMart. Have better things to do than wait around for the UPS guy to pick up damaged goods.
3,Looks Ok.,"It's definitely cheap. It doesn't really look cheap to me up on the wall, but I'm no connoisseur. Mine came with a little bit of a plastic piece broken off. Since it was on the back of the clock, I just kept it. Always irritating to buy something new that comes damaged, no matter how small. Bottom line--I didn't want to spend more money. I got what I paid for, and I'm satisfied."
1,Cheap! DON'T BUY!,"The only reason I'm giving this clock 1 star is because it arrived. The other reviewers must have gotten a totally different clock than I received because:1. The background is paper as well as the hands.2. The clock did not even run with a fresh battery.3. Upon attempting to set the time, the time-set wheel snapped right off because it was such a thin piece of plastic.FYI, everything on this clock is made in China, including the movement. Normally they are made in Taiwan or Japan where they are of much higher quality. I am returning the clock and not risking getting a new one with similar problems."
1,This clock is horrible,"I hate this clock. As soon as I received it, it was broken. I replace the batteries every time it stops (which is very often) and even after I do that it only lasts about a day. I would not recommend this to anyone. It stinks. DONT'T BUY IT! NEVER! NEEEEVVVERRRR!!!!"
2,Needed New Replacement Clock,"We had our previous wall clock for over 10 years, but it stopped working. It was artsy with a lot of character. Wanted something a little larger and with some old world character this time, but also did not want to spend a lot of money. I am amazed at the price of some clocks! Read the reviews and decided on this Chaney. We love it! It looks like it is made of metal on the wall, and the parcment look on the face is well done. So far, it is keeping accurate time and we have gotten several comments on how great it looks. We feel the price is incredible for the quality! So far, a happy customer!**UPDATE** 1/21/13Uh oh.... clock loses a minute or two every 5-6 days. I have now had to take off wall reset fast about 2 minutes several times now. Needless to say we are not as happy a customer as when first received. Not sure what we are going to do yet... maybe just live with it. Definitely disappointed! Have to downgrade our rating!"
5,Very nice,"I bought this clock last year not only because of the good reviews but in spite of the poor ones. It keeps perfect time, is silent, and looks very substantial, rather than the lightweight materials of which it's constructed.. It's a great clock and a good look for any decor."
2,Damaged and Cheap looking.,"The Clock came damaged on the back. Looks extremely cheap. Only thing good about this clock is that it is big, 18-inch diameter."
1,stopped working after 4 months,"This dvd player stopped reading discs about four months after I bought it. It will only read a disc about once every 30 tries now and has started eating dvds. Not only does the laser fail to read the discs now, but the belt is also broken and the dvd fell off the tray and was damaged. And the other annoying part is that the VCR still works fine, so it seems a waste to scrap it altogether. You're better off having a separate dvd player, and certainly not a ""daewoo"" one. It may seem like a bargain, but believe me, it's not."
1,Broken right out of the box,"Brand new unit, but the VCR player would not rewind. Too bad too, because the VCR plays fine, as does the DVD player...nice picture and sound, and it plays DVD+Rs, VCDs, etc. as advertised on Amazon. The unit looks nice enough too, though a little large. It has a solid feeling construction...made of metal and not plastic like many of the new low-end models. Regardless of what works, without the VCR being able to rewind, it's certainly not proving its reliablity. I guess I am glad it showed itself right away. Am going to return and buy a better quality unit for about $50 more."
1,I now have an over-priced VCR,"I bought this because I wanted the convenience of a combo unit and because I also have a Daewoo TV. It worked great for the first 5 or 6 months and then, suddenly, stopped playing DVDs. It sounds like a common problem with this unit. I won't buy Daewoo brand products again."
2,Poor quality VCR module,"The unit I purchased played DVD's with great quality. The recording and playback of VHS tapes, however, was about the worst of any VCR I have used in 23 years of video taping. The recordings (even at SP) have a great deal of noise and even streaking. This unit makes tapes recorded on other machines unwatchable. Just to make sure it was not bad tapes, I played the tapes back on several other machines (none of which are the recorders used to record the tapes), and they looked great. The Daewoo makes them look like they were recorded with bad reception or something.I am sending this machine back right away. A similar-quality DVD player is half the price of this thing."
4,Above my skill level,"I'm a single guy who would rather change his engine oil than prepare a meal. I bought a set of chain store knives, but they were so cheap they didn't cut straight. Quality kitchen knives cost a fortune, so I thought I'd give these a try. They are small and light, and feel like surgical instruments. Even so, they are quite strong and do cut in a straight line. I'm somewhat baffled by the bird's beak knife, I played around with it but have found no use for it in the kitchen (but it makes a great letter opener). I don't know how they hold an edge since I haven't had them for very long. I'm happy with these knives, but paring knives are too exotic for me, the straight knife is all I use."
3,Small knives.,"These are good, but very small. They are so small they do not feel comfortable in your hand. I thought they would be a little larger. Other than that they are good."
4,A bargain,"The standard paring knife included here is wonderful. It's thin, lightweight, flexible, and sharp. It slides through vegetables as easily as it does through butter. It neatly conforms to the contours of what you're cutting, if you so desire. I cored some tomatoes last night, and didn't have any issues. Great, too, for mincing garlic.Honestly, I haven't really found much use for the other two knives in this package, as they're specialty knives, and I don't do a whole lot of the peeling which they're useful for. The normal paring knife is fine for most non-peeling sorts of tasks.But, for $10, you're not going to find a better paring knife. The only way you're going to get something better is to spend four or five times as much, and I'd rather just buy a new one of these every few years (under heavy use). (As another reviewer said, they're quite thin, so sharpening would be a pain -- I haven't had to do so, yet.)"
3,dominica,i found these paring knives sharp but thin steel and plastic handles also thin. for the price they are okay. have not tried sharpening them as they are still sharp after several uses.
3,"Decent price, sharp to start but then..","Very reasonable price, I bought these based on all the rave reviews. Sadly they've gone dull in a short while. The Mrs. mother uses them. I personally am very happy with the Cutco set I received. I barely use my Henckles 4stars now. Cheers, Ravi Shanghavi, Ottawa"
2,Cheap Knives,"I should have known that 3 knives for this price wouldn't be very good. The blades are thin and not very sharp. Even worse is the handle size--very flat and not big enough to get a good grip on. I'm surprised these are rated almost 5 stars. If I wasn't so lazy, I would have returned them. This brand is always rated so highly by America's Test Kitchen, too. Save your money and buy a more expensive knife. I got some J.A. Henckels with No Stain blades that I put in the dishwasher."
2,Ouch,"They are sharp. They are dulling fast. I have had them less than a month. Take note (because I did not) these are small knives (paring). So small they are awkward, but they work. I wouldn't reorder them, but it does seem like a lot of people would - and Unfortunately that's the reason I bought them.UPDATE they no longer cut through my tougher fruit - grapefruit, orange etc. Waste of money - I already bought new ones - not these of course"
4,Great for paring most things.,The blades are flexible so a winter squash wouldn't be the thing on which you would use these.
5,Makes a nice gift,"Useful, decent knives at a reasonable price, in a gift-wrappable box. What's not to like?"
1,"poor quality, would not purchase again","My wife said she wanted/needed a new paring knife. These looked like a great buy, being a ""name brand"", (same manufacturer as swiss army knives (of which we presently own 2)).We have had them since the summer. She has complained about them in the past and yesterday remarked about how bad they are and that I should write a review of them and say as much.We could have gotten equal quality knives in a ""dollar store"". We will instead replace these knives at a ""Brick and mortar"" store where we can see and judge the knife prior to purchase."
5,Small but Superb!,"Knives were shorter then I expected but in this case, size doesn't matter - knives were very sharp, easy to hold in your hand, cut thru food like magic, easy clean-up, grips are non-slip, overall an excellent product. I highly recommend them, and I will buy more Victorinox kitchen knives!"
4,Small but Mighty,"When I got the package from Amazon, I was surprised at how SMALL these knives are. They are not substantial feeling--they are just little knives, smaller than you'd think for a paring knife. But they are probably the best knives I've ever had. The small size means you can grip them tightly; they are solid and don't slip around at all. They can slice a roast like a stick of butter, and they slice tomatoes neatly and cleanly. I use them all the time. Just be ready for three LITTLE knives."
4,My Favorites,"Love, love, love these sharp little knives. The serrated blade is perfect for slicing tomatoes and the birds beak knife is my favorite for peeling potatoes and other veggies. All three are my first choice when I need a small knife. And they are sharp!"
5,Great knives,I have been using the knives for a few months now and I am very happy with the purchase. I started using the curved knife only recently and it actually is the best for chopping vegetables finely
5,Paring knives,We all wanted a set of these paring knives once we saw them. Hopefully they will stay sharp for a while. They will get alot of use in our houses.
5,Excellent Knives and Deal,In a kitchen that has many small knives these are the workhorse's. They very sharp and can get fixed up with the steel easily. A must have for cooking and great deal to boot.
5,LOVE THESE!,"Best knives I have purchased in awhile. Fit great in your hand, light weight, and cut extremely well. Must buy!"
5,Victorinox 48042 Cutlery 3-Piece Paring Knife Set,This is my second set of these knives and I like them so much I wanted another and I bought a few more for gifts.
3,Would Not Purchase Again,"I have tried several dozens knives in my life, and these turned out to be very sharp, but not particularly great to use. Despite the claims of ease in handling, I found the handles to be too thin for comfort in long term use, and they were very slippery and hard to hold onto when wet. I found them to be no better than paring knives I already have in my drawer."
4,Excellent knivrs.,"The blades are very sharp out of the box. The assortment is very good. I like the Fibrox handle on the 6"", but not as much on these; they are a little narrow. Otherwise, very happy and recommend them."
4,Teeny handles,"The blade is great, as expected. But.... the handles!!!! They seem to be sized for kindergarten-sized hands. If Victorinox put the same fibrox handles found on their larger knives on these paring knives, they would have an unbeatable winner. So be forewarned: if you have large hands, you will find these uncomfortable to use; otherwise they are a great addition to your knife collection."
3,Victorinox 3=piece Cutlery Set,Works well enough to be useful in he kitchen. Too early to tell how well it holds a sharp edge.
4,Decent for the price,These knives are decent if you plan to use them for 12 mo and then rotate them to garage or garden use. Fairly sharp when new but the edge does dull quickly even though I segregate my edged kitchen tools carefully. My last set stuck with me for a while and at the end they were barely usable so I will be more proactive sharpening these to see if that helps their life.
2,2 star is generous.,Knives are my hobby. The blades are good and maintain a nice edge... it's the handles. I own a few Victorinox knives with the Fibrox and wood handles but the handles of these knives are so small and cheap I'm surprised they called them Victorinox. There is no weight or balance. How these knives received so many 4 and 5 stars still confuse me. I guess they are cheap so you get what you pay for here. I'll keep them as back up knives.
3,A Bit Thin,"I haven't purchased new paring knives in years but decided it was time for some new ones. I finally settled on this set based on some of the reviews.They are ""adequate"" but not something I want to brag about. They are so thin and light weight that I find them difficult to use. The little curved one is nice for peeling apples and potatoes but they aren't what I was expecting. The handles are made of very light weight plastic. Not at all as good as the old fashioned paring knives with the wood handles."
4,Good small knives,"I got these knives after reading other reviews and going a little crazy for Julia Child. All the knives are sharp right out of the package. I don't find myself using the beak shaped one, but I have used the other 2 for everything from cutting meat, and chopping veggies to deboning a duck, chickens and a turkey. The knives are precise and compact. I have small hands and these knives offer great control and good grip. Highly recommend the set. Bought it alongside the Victorinox 8 inch chef's knife. Great gift!"
4,Still fairly sharp after one year of heavy use,I use these knives many times everyday. They were extremely sharp at purchase. They are still fairly sharp after a year of use and no sharpening. Will have to finally break down and try sharpening them.
2,Brainwashing propaganda but well edited,"This is a classic circle jerk book that consolidates a number of articles from educators and educational researchers who talk about the same thing, and cite each other or similar data and research. The authors do write well, so I gave it two stars. But it has under/overtones of the same old myths in erroneous educational ideology that is actually the malaise killing our educational system - dump more money into schools; teachers are underpaid and overworked; high stakes standardized testing is bad. Folks might be well advised to pick up a copy of Jay P. Greene's ""Educational Myths"" to run a little de-tox on the stuff they read here."
4,Deb Meier is the real deal!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to know about NCLB and the real effects it has on the public education system. She (along with several other progressive education advocates Kohn, Darling-Hammond, Sizer, etc.) tries to get the word out on how detrimental this legislation is for public education: NCLB has made those low-performing schools pleases where no one wants to teach: increased emphasis is placed on some subjects while others are neglected in order to raise standardized test scores. Meier et. al. tries to talk sense to anyone who will listen!!! I want everyone who cares about public education, as well as the future of our democracy, READ THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Important Read for ALL Americans,"This book should be required reading for every administrator and teacher in the public school system -- possibly for every parent as well, particularly those who give any sort of credence to standardized test scores. Undoubtedly a polemic, this book still provides too much important information to discount. The authors of this collection of essays generally agree that public schools should be accountable; but they very carefully and thoroughly outline why NCLB is not the appropriate or accurate way to do so."
3,CIPA Trailer mirrors,"Easy to setup, but mirrors are small and tapered. Better than nothing to see around. Mirrors will slide around and have to constantly reposition and tighten down. When raining, the straps get very loose. I almost lost one before I could find a place big enough to stop. Straps stretch out some when wet I found out. Rubber feet on pads move around. Not sticky enough. Hooks will bend if you tighten too much. Overall not impressed at all. Buying real replacement mirrors."
1,Very noisy and hard to install. Not usable for me.,"The cushion pads would not stick to the unit on mine. It took two people to mount due to the pads. Once we got on the road it lasted on my car all of 10 miles before I had enough and removed it. The wind whistles through it and makes a dual-tone sound that reminds me of a train whistle. Seriously, it's loud! The mirror also vibrates a lot making it hard to see. It's the glass itself that's vibrating, not the whole unit, so it doesn't matter how securely you get it mounted. Also scratched the mirror housing on my car!"
3,Cipa 11960 towing mirror,"Product fit well on my FJ Crusier mirrors, but came up short on witdth needed to see around my 8' wide rv trailer. Mirrors did vibrate some contrary to manuf. claim they would not. Also had some wind noise."
2,Think twice about buying this mirror.,"I've install these on both a 09 Tacoma and a 04 F-150. Didn't have too much trouble adjusting them on the Tacoma. I did have a little trouble mounting them at the correct angle so that they were actually useful. After that they worked ok. Put them on the Ford and it mounted a little easier. But on my last trip I was having troubles adjusting it to the right angle. While trying to adjust it, it was like there was a dead spot in it. The view too high. Try to lower it a bit then it would go too low. It acted like it was sticking and then it would almost ""click"" to the next spot which was way too low. After trying time and time again to adjust it the mirror finally just fell out and cracked into pieces. It snapped back into place but it's now a mirrored spiderweb. So that was the icing on the cake. Going to go find something better. These looks nice but lesson learned. Don't buy on looks, buy on quality!"
5,Great Mirror,This is a very good mirror that takes a little practice to get on the first couple of times but is worth the time. I have a Dodge Dakota and these mirrors allowed me to see completely down the sides of my full size travel trailer.
4,UTM's work great!,"I bought 2 Universal Towing Mirrors because I didn't want any mirror frame work attached to my vehicle. The UTM's worked great. It took a couple trips to get them set up properly, but once I did, they are quick & easy to use. I'd recommend them anyone who wants to tow, but doesn't want that permanent mirror on their vehicle."
2,"It's the best mirror currently availble for my truck, but...","I needed new towing mirrors for my 2007 Chevy Tahoe, and the CIPA slide-over mirror was not availble for the 2007 model with the lights in the mirrors. So, the Universal Towing mirror was the best viable alternative, I thought. IT works OK, but the way the mirror mounts places it on the back-side of the installed side mirrors, making the CIPA mirrors hard to see well. They get obstructed from Tahoe's own mirrors. Also, the mirrors fall easily -- luckily it happened when I was parked, and the mirror didn't break. All in all, it the best they currently have availble."
1,Too small.,"The idea and design is great. These mirrors look good and are aerodynamic.But; they are way too small to be able to see anything. The regular mirrors on my GX470 works better. Also, the mirrors tend to sag over time as you drive because of vibrations.I returned my mirrors and am on the lookout for some which are larger."
1,Broke,The clips that hook on to the vehicle mirror snapped/broke off after just the second time we used them. We aren't frequent campers so it was outside of the return policy.
1,Not worth the money,These mirrors are not worth the money. Difficult to adjust and will not stay in place. Have used them four times in 2 months and the rubber suction cups on the feet are cracking and breaking. I normally do not throw things away if I think I might have a use for them or their parts in the future. I threw these away.
1,"ITEM WAS USED, DIRTY AND MISSING PARTS!","I received this item and when I opened it, there were mud splatters on it and there were dried bugs on the outside! The metal clips are missing and the rubber feet are worn. Unbelievable! When I inspected the box, it was clear that it was repacked and taped up.I am sure the mirror would work great if I could mount it, and I would give it some stars in the rating. But since I can't even mount it, I have to give it and AMAZON a big ZERO for restocking a used, returned item and selling it as ""new"". Unfortunately I can't post this unless I give it at least ONE star - but they don't deserve it. BEWARE!"
1,Mirror Went SMASH!,We were always having to adjust these mirrors. They constantly come loose...until one finally went flying off onto the road and got smashed under our travel trailers wheels. Won't be getting the same thing as a replacement.
1,Save your money,"Although the concept is good, there are some serious flaws with this product. I would definitely not purchase it again.1. The mirror is too small to be used at highway speed. The vibration in the mirror makes it very difficult to use when changing lanes.2. The suction cups slip very easily on the car mirror base, especially in the rain.3. The mirror itself fell out of the base while adjusting it after only 2 months of use."
2,Won't fit 2008 Ford Expedition,"These mirrors won't fit a 2008 Ford Expedition (Eddie Bauer) with turn signals. Although the two outboard feet are adjustable, the Expedition mirror housing is too curved to get a good purchase. Also, the bottom lip near the turn signal is too shallow for the CIPA clip to get a good grip and it will bend under tension."
2,Floppy Mirror,"Good quality product but does not fasten securely to my 4rnr mirror. Even with duct tape, it would not maintain a usable position."
1,Watch out,"When I bought these I had high hopes that they would be in great condition, but when they arrived, one of the mirrors was loose from the holder and had to be glued back on, on the other one, the section cups that hold it to the mirror of the truck were missing, an these were supposed to be new in the box, frist time I used this website to get something an it will probably be the last too!"
2,CIPA 11960 Universal Towing Mirror,Not bad for the price. I used these mirrors for a few months & they did serve thier purpose. My biggest complaint would be the vibration while driving making the viewing area hard to see. A bit scary while changing lanes on the interstate pulling a 30' travel trailer. I ended up purchasing the slide on CIPA mirrors that were made specifically for my vehicle wich are much better.
5,Required Mirrors,This is a used product but arrived looking new. Fits like a glove and received 2 mirrors with no broken or missing parts.
2,Needs improvement,"The mirrors worked well for half my first trip.....after that they started to sag. The mirrors are about half the size of my tacoma's mirrors, so, they work but have a limited field of view. After 5 trips on these mirrors, the adjusting belts gave way when I tried to tighten them down. I will not be buying these again."
2,mirrors,The rubber feet fell off and scratched mirror. Sagged down during use. Not good for use un ford sport trac.
1,Clips broke on the first trip,Nice idea but cheaply made. The clips that hold the mirror on broke on the first trip out. I returned them and am looking for a more durable solution.
3,I Have Seen Better But I Have Scene Worse,"This movie is just ok. I wouldnt pay alot of money for it but if you can find it pretty cheap somewhere you should pick it up. The movie is about this mad painter that cannot find the right shade of red that he is looking for. His girlfriend pricks her finger of a nail he finally finds the right shade of red, and that shade is BLOOD RED.He finds more people and he kills them so he can paint more things. To be honest this movie is a bit on the boring side. Dont get me wrong this movie isnt horrible but like I said its not the best. If you do decide to get it pick it up cheap and pick it up at Amazon."
2,Not as entertaining as Blood Feast,"Normally, if you're in the mood for a good, cheesy gorefest, you would look to Herchell Gordon Lewis. However, I can only say that this film is boring in comparison to most known gore films. It has to do with a deranged artist who enjoys success only when he paints with human blood. Not bad for 60's gore, but still leaves much to be desired, and of course the only reason to see this type of film would be for gore(or cheap laughs). You've been warned."
3,"Interesting, but could be refined","The plot in this movie is interesting, but it's execution needs to be improved. But, let's face it, no one really watches these type of movies because we are intrigued by character development and all that other literary type stuff we expect from novels. Nope, these types of movies are for gore hounds, and in this category it is somewhat satisfactory. This movie did not have as much gore as I imagined. Given the few gore scenes(I recount about 5 gorey scenes), it was pretty devastating and heart-wrenching. This movie also features the corny music typical for movies from these times and bad sound editing(too much echoing).Overall, this movie is decent if you enjoy watching actors being mutilated, spewing out their fake blood and organs. However, the movie was rather short, filled with way too much useless and boring dialogue. Unless you are a H.G.L. fan or you just want to see some plain gore, this movie isn't really good for much else."
2,Disappointing,"This film is a real let down as a follow-up to ""Blood Feast"", and not really worth the while watching. This time, a deranged artist starts slaughtering young girls so that he can use their blood for paint, but the gore scenes are much fewer, and the rest of the plot is dull and drawn out, without the camp hysterics of the cast that made its predecessor so enjoyable. Thus, the slow parts and in-between scenes seem to drag on forever. There is one incredible scene where the artist is seen using his hands to wring blood out of the intestines of one still-living victim, but apart from that, and looking at the so-called ""masterpieces"" that the blood-meister has created on display in a snooty gallery, you will be snoozing off way before the climax. Try the other Lewis films first, leave this one until last."
2,Not as pathetic as Gore Gore Girls,"But still very bad.This one is just plain boring! Scenes are very long and drawn out and unintresting. This is supposed to be shock trash and the film is trying to be a be beack party comedy. The gore, as usual with H.G. Lewis blows. I could have done better with 2 dollars. This movie is very lame and stupid.Go get some real gore, this just plain sucks."
1,ugh!,"Simply awful. Not a good song in the bunch. I 'fortunately' bought it used for $3.50 and still feel ripped off! I've heard a number of other Neotropic cuts that I really like, and I will try other CD's, but this one is a loser."
5,best green tea,"most green tea tastes like pond water to me and is hard on my stomach. this tea is different. it smells good, tastes good, and goes down easy. and the little ""yogi-isms"" are fun...."
4,Great Flavor - Not Bitter,"The flavor of this kombucha green tea is fantastic, it beats out other green teas and definitely wins by a landslide if you compare it to the kombucha teas that are chilled with the live cultures.I am skeptical about the kombucha benefits in a dried tea format. I don't know if I am really getting the same as in a liquid live form and plan to do more research on it. As a green tea, though, I love the slight berry flavors."
4,Great tasting tea,I saw this tea on amazon but didn't want to invest in 6 boxes without knowing if I liked it. I found it at the grocery store and it was 3.50 a box (way more expensive then here on amazon) and decided to try it. This to has a wonderful smell and flavor - drank two cups of it the first day I bought it. Will definitely be adding it to my tea collection.
3,Only buy this is you like the spearmint taste,"Spearmint is a very strong flavor and it overpowers the whole tea. If you take a leaf and tear one and smell it, that is the aroma and taste of this tea. I personally cannot stand spearmint but this tea is good for you. I have to drink it fast and get a ""blech"" feeling afterwards, its just how I react to a minty tea."
2,Kombucha tea,"Green tea. Kombuch is supposedly good for you but this product tastes worse than dirty socks water. I was not impressed, but at least I tried. Then I got a recipe and got the stuff and mde it from scratch, and it was a little sweet but drinkable."
2,Wish I had known more about Kombucha,"After reading that some people have issues with Kombucha tea, I Googled it and read some more. I recommend that others do the same before drinking it. I am sure that Yogi Tea produces their Kombucha in a careful environment, but it can cause health problems. It also does not appear to be appropriate for people with Candida despite some claims. It contains alcohol, sugars, fungi, yeast and molds, and a study showed that it did not improve symptoms of people with Candida. I've been drinking it almost daily and have been having unexplained stomach aches lately and will try eliminating this tea to see if it helps, now that I know more. Again, read up on Kombucha and make your own informed decision."
5,Amazing Tea,I feel much better energy wise after drinking this tea for several days. I also have less aches. It's wonderful and tastes great. I love it~
5,Great tasting tea,"This tea really grows on you. It becomes a habit to just drink it and relax at night, which is perfectly fine considering the small amount of caffeine in it (25% that of coffee), and that it's green tea so it has a good amount of anti-oxidants. Quite a good find, if you ask me."
5,Great Taste!,"I hate the original green tea but this one is Exceptional! Great taste! No bitter taste, very sweet. You won't regret getting a full box..plus the price is super cheap!!"
5,Yogi Green Tea Kombucha,"This tea is great. If you like green tea, this has the kombucha blend of herbs in it that has a wonderful flavor. Sweeten with some honey and enjoy!"
5,"Unique flavor, great tea","I can't think of too much else to say other than thanks to how good this tea tastes, I hardly miss coffee!"
1,just another machine,First off once and if the bands break were are you suppose to order repalcements? In addition the leg attatchment I had would not fit on the frame like it should! After getting tired of fooling with this machine I threw it in the garbage.
1,Not worth the money,"We were very disappointed with this product. The battery did not hold a charge, we weren't able to play mpeg-4 audio files, there is no playlist, and the menu didn't navigate correctly. If you got into games, there was no way to navigate back into music. We had to turn if off and back on again to start the menu over again. Fortunately, there was no problem returning it for a refund."
1,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this one. battery died. didn't work very well. picture looks much better than the product. stay away from this one and spend a couple more bucks to get trhe sensa.
2,poor quality,"i bought this item for my dad for his birthday. i opened it. i was interested in seeing it because it wasn't something i had seen before. it wasnt alot of money so i bought it. after i opened it, i turned it on and it seemed fine i put on a couple of songs and it worked alright i turned it off and put it away 3 days later he opened it for his birthday and the thing didnt work. it turned on but the only thing it showed was a stupid loading screen and nothing else.It was made by some unknown company.. IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE ITS OWN BOX!! the box it came in was for an ipod nano i bought it new and they need to take another companys box to send it to me in. after seeing how fake it was i didnt even bother talking to their customer support..DONT BY THIS ITEM.. by the ipod nano get the real thing. ATLEAST YOU KNOW THE BRAND OF THE MP3."
3,kennel roof,The tarp wasn't wide enough. When we put it up the tarp didn't go over the sides so when it rained the water ran right into the kennel.
2,Read carefully,I looked at the picture and read the reviews for this product and thought it was the whole things...the kennel with a roof. It is just the roof ! This was a little misleading.
2,too much,took too long to arrive and its too prici i thought it was the kennel and the roof but o well
3,sanabel flats,"I have not finished the book yet but am enjoying the first few pages.It appears to be a good book.It is to early for a review, but you requested one."
1,Female readers be advised: TEDIOUS,"I read Captiva last month and decided Randy Wayne White doesn't like women. I tried to ignore this and ordered Sanibal Flats which I'm currently trying to read without tossing. Good thing I bought the paperback, it will have a new (and brief) life in the recycle bin.On page 70 of Sanibel Flats: ""He (ford) had always avoided promiscuous women and would have probably avoided Sally had he known in advance."" By page 77 he's having sex with two women in one day (and bragging about the 'multiple times'). Double Standard, Mr. White? Or maybe the editor called in sick that day?There's also a dissing comment about feminists which had me rolling my eyes. Mr. White, the goal of feminism is that everyone benefits.I chose to read these books wanting to read about the flora and fauna of this part of Florida. What am insulting waste of my precious time."
3,An okay book that I liked,"Hmmm, enjoyed this book even though the title, ""Sanibel Flats"" seemed to indicate there would be more about the real Sanibel, FL. Also thought that even though the book seemed to be written more for a male audience than a female audience, there was enough in it to keep the women readers entertained. The book had a satisfying conclusion, even though the ending was not as much of a ""twist"" to me as it seems to have been to other readers. The main character is likeable and yet somewhat mysterious and there was enough action and suspense to keep me turning the pages. I'm looking forward to continuing on with the series."
1,I threw it into the garbage,"read it up to page 294 (out of 307) then threw it in the garbage.too many faults for me to list, and that would spoil the ending. I will just say that not one of the excessive number of sub-plots is resolved satisfactorily. most are a dead-end insult to the reader. many characters, central to the so-called plot, do not get even one line of dialogue. the author tries way too hard to be clever in his plot twists."
4,"Every page an event, every chapter an adventure!","This book evoked every emotion. I was relaxed andserene when on the beach. I was pumping adrenalin when with the ""enemy"". I was alert and skeptical when with ""friends"". GREAT READING !!"
1,"Smells like a dead squid, partially decomposed and floating.","This book isnt even about Sanibel. Its about a made up country in Central America called Masagua! The only good thing is, it introduces the cast of characters. But Doc is a lout, not the Grissom-like guy he is in Captiva. And Tomlinson, we learn went to Harvard, but actually was insane for a while. Its really such a horrid book I wonder how the author improved so much in later books. What the heck are Boise speakers; I think the term is Bose. The book was written in 1960. Randy is as smart as M.D. and so he learned to write. This must have been his first book."
5,Great reading!,Read them in order is my suggestion. It does make a difference! You will enjoy Doc Ford and his buddies! I have read them all and am waiting for the next one. In the meantime I have read John D. MacDonald's first 9 Travis McGee series.
4,Intrigued,"I recently completed my first Doc Ford novel and have to say I am intrigued by this character. RWW's writing style left me craving to know more about this complex hero and I will surely pick up his second novel, The Heat Islands, soon. The supporting cast adds a great deal of depth and is well documented, providing a good deal of insight into each one of their backgrounds, making you feel more attached to the novel. Overall, I would recommend at a rating of a 4."
2,disappointing,thought it was original by george lucasonly the forward was by lucasthis was a let down - super bummed
4,Nice binding of all three books.,"These are classics. My son is totally into them and it's nice to have this to read to him at night (although the writing is a little sophisticated for little kids, true fans can make it interesting by mimicking key lines from the movie when reading them aloud).The binding is very good quality. The book holds together.Nice print, easy to read.Regarding the content: C'mon - it's Star Wars. It's freakin' awesome. Eleven stars!!"
4,This too is an alright Star Wars read.,"These novelizations (in this book) are good, but just not great. The films are so much better written and enjoyable. But these are a good read nonetheless. Just not anywhere near as good as the film they are based on. The storyline is faithful to the films for the most part, but some of the different stuff in them was just not to my tastes. All in all, each is a solid 4 star effort and they are good to have in a Star Wars fan's collection."
3,"The MOVIES were great, but the books...","Overall the writing here is no better than average. I believe most of the high ratings are due simply to the reviewers really liking the Star Wars movies. The books, on average, add very little to the story seen in the movies. Often people will see a movie and say ""Oh, the book was much better."" Usually that's because they made a movie from the book. Here it was vice-versa, and the result is not the same. When you consider this is actually a volume of 3 separate books, they are really too short to be very good. A 2 hour movie usually comes from a 400 page book. Here we have 3 movies resulting in almost 400 pages of more or less just going over what happened in the movies. Granted what happened in the movies is pretty good. The third writer, Kahn, does the best writing IMO and manages to add a bit to what we got out of the movie. Recommended for completeness for Star Wars fans, but if you are one you've already ready, eh?"
5,A superb book to follow the excellent films,"Having grown up with the Star Wars films, reading the book was obviously important to me. However, I had my doubts as books of films are not always up to scratch.This was an exception to that though. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and have since gone on to read many of the other Star Wars books.After reading the books, I have found that there are things in th film that you can pick out that you may not have seen the first time round. I would recommend this to any Star Wars fan."
1,"Lucas can buy better writters, can't he?","Perhaps the original printed edition didn't quite have the resources behind it as, let's say, the movie's Special Edition had. I regret that such a spectacular vision and story goes unfairly represented in print. All Star Wars fans know that this broad, complex and vibrant universe Lucas created and was able to translate into a visual medium (sometimes better than others, i.e., ""A New Hope:"" compared to ""Return of the Jedi""), deserves a literary treatment by talents at least of the caliber of Timothy Zhan (who wrote the ""officially sanctioned"" literary sequels to Episodes IV through VI)or better. Maybe after the release of ALL the ""prequels"" Lucas can use some spare change from the BILLIONS of dollars he will be worth to buy better Translators for his magnificent vision."
5,These books are beyond words!,"I love the Star Wars Trilogy and I think anyone else who reads it will love it too. The characters are described so well that I can visulise them and everything about them on my mind's eye. My favorite book out of the three is Return of the Jedi, but Star Wars, (A New Hope,) and The Empire Strikes Back make it very hard to choose. I also love the movies. If you like the book, it is a pretty good bet you'll like the movie too."
5,Thumbs up.,"I am 14, I don't do hot in Language Arts, but I certainly can read like my sister. This book is probably not for kids though, there is some vocabulary in here that is kind of hard to understand. I am on A New Hope right now, on page 60 I think. So far, there are things that are included that were never in the movie. For instance, when in the book Luke is talking about a space battle he saw with Biggs and Windy and some other people I think. In the movie, this never happened. Also in the book that didn't happen in the movie, is when Biggs was talking to Luke about he was going to the Academy. I don't really understand why this is, but it just is. There are also some parts in the book that are reversed or in different spots than in the movie. This is still very similar to the movie.. except in words. I would definitely highly reccomend this book to anybody that's about my age ( 14 ) and up."
4,Not as good as the rest of the series,"Although I love the ghatti series, this generation of characters just isn't as interesting. Diccon doesn't seem to do much and Jenneth really annoyed me...having her lose her memory was also cliched and one would think her Bondmate would still be able to reach her. Let's hope the characters grow up a bit more and acquire some dimension in future books"
5,THE BEST BOOK GREENO HAS WRITTEN YET!,"This book was wonderful. I loved the first series, but in this one she seemed to have done the best. The plot is gripping and funny, while at the same time serious. If you are reading this, I definetly reccomend buying the book now."
3,"Ghatti, continued","It starts off slowly as there's so much that has happened between the end of the last series and this one, but if you plough through it, it gets better. Not as good as the first three books, but still a worthwhile read as you are already involved with the characters."
4,Easy and Efficient,"This bike rack is extremely easy to use and requires no special tools to attach to the trunk of our car. And the clips holding the bikes helped to provide ease of mind on our first trip which was a 30-minute highway drive at highway speeds. On the way home, the bottom strap came away from the bumper (probably due to our not pulling the strap tight enough), but this had no bearing on the bikes. They remained sturdily attached. The rack folds up easily enough and can be stored in the trunk of the car. And the price can't be beat. Our local bike shop tried to sell us a rack that was obviously inferior, and twice the price. I would definitely recommend this rack."
5,Excellent purchase!,"We wanted to take our bikes with us on a >500 mi road trip, but my husband was quite worried about a rack scratching his car or not fitting over his spoiler. I was a bit nervous about this purchase and read several reviews beforehand. Luckily, they were right and this was an excellent choice! It worked great, was easy to set up, fit over the spoiler, remained secure the entire drive, and didn't leave any scratches. We did only put 2 bikes on the 3 bike rack. I'm not sure how 3 would fit because we had a bit of trouble getting just 2 on the first time. I would definitely recommend buying a little more room if you aren't very experienced with bike racks, but a great purchase overall."
1,If you have a hatchback don't even waste your money and time -it dinged my car!,"I bought this rack based on some of the good reviews I read. I own a VW Golf 07 (hatchback) which according to Allen's manual fit right with the 103S rack. However, as soon as I installed this rack in my car and drove very few miles, I noticed that the bikes were coming off. I tightened-up the belts twice and re-read the instructions flier just to make sure. Then after 2-3 miles...I hit a pothole, the rack got lose and the bikes almost fell off to the pavement --I had to pull over.Results: my trunk was dinged badly, and one of the bike wheels got damaged. Yet I had to dismount the bikes and start all over again so I could make it home. I changed the position of the rack -thinking that was going to help but this piece of steel never worked. It's one of the worst items I have ever bought.If you have a hatchback or a minivan, SUV don't waste your time and money and then more money in repairs for your car!"
2,Three bikes? Not usually,"I fought with this bike rack several times, and almost lost a bike to the road. It attaches easily, but it's not really made for three bikes. I like the locking cable and will use that again, but I've replaced this rack. I think I would use it for just two bikes, but that's not my situation."
2,one of the latch broke,"one of the latch which secures the band broke after half a year of use, 2 mountain bike and 1 road bike. I'm using a wire tie to fix it now, does not want to depend on the other latch, it might broke at anytime. This product is otherwise a good product but the latch made from some mix of plastic material, it should be made from metal which is much more durable."
1,it is not made for three bikes,"I owned it for one year and a half.I used it for one adult bike and a child bike. it was O'K.Today I used a third bike,After two miles of drive,The rack broke."
2,No that good,"I got this product couple weeks ago, and at installing it for the first time, some metal part breaks on my. I'm giving it a second try just because the product is really easy to use."
4,Allen bike rack 103s,Great product. Easy to install on vehicle in minutes the very first time. Have only used it with one bike to this point. Only sugguestion is the need to secure front wheel from moving while driving on interstate.
3,A little fussy..but it works,"This is a very well built rack and once you get it working with your vehicle it'll be fine. Worth the $$. The issue I have is that the upper and lower cross braces are straight. If your vehicle has any curvature, the metal brace will rub the body. I fixed this by adding a layer of foam rubber pipe insulation onto each foam pad, moving the metal bars away from my vehicle body."
5,Great solution for PC to stereo connection,This is a real good inexpensive solution to play your computer-stored music on your home stereo system. I use this cable with an X-Mod controller (Creative Labs)hooked to my laptop through the USB port for higher quality sound output from my stereo.
3,All around mediocre,"Mediocre acting and script, bad treacly music, Tori Spelling looks like she's in her late 30's and she's playing a sophomore."
2,Not bad for Horseface Spelling,"GREAT,DRAMATIC FILM!!! I AM A LIFETIME MOVIE LOVER AND I WAS GLAD TO HAVE ORDERED AN ORIGINAL FILM..GOOD ACTING AND HORSEFACE SPELLING WAS NOT ALL THAT BAD...."
4,Fun,Sometimes i get in the mood for a silly but true crime movie and this is one of them. I never cared for Tori Spelling (not much of an actress) but she's not half bad in this.
5,Wonderful insight into the heart of a tormented girl.,"Kellie Martin puts in an absolutely brilliant performance as the desperate-to-be-accepted outcast. Tori Spelling is wonderful as the golden girl who seems to have it all, because she fits in with what others prize, including the alleged adults who run the show.What is so sad here is that Kellie Martin's character is the one with the talent and drive. If she had not been pushed over the edge by the taunting of others and her childlike need for approval, life would have ultimately proven her to be the success.Kellie Martin's performance is so on-target that at times it is agonizing (and embarrassing) to watch. The subtle changes of emotion on her face during the principal's ""be the best"" speech should have won her awards.If you are a fan of Lifetime movies, Death of a Cheerleader definitely belongs in your collection."
5,Great Recording Tapes,"I am glad I brought these Tapes, because when I go in the store, now they just don't carry, these packs of tapes, like this any more, most the stores carry not is CD's I wanted a 5 pack of blanks cassette tapes and all walmart had, was the 2 pack on tapes, and I have to spend more money if I wanted, a larger amount of tapes, I have to end up keep going back, to the store and buying this 5 pack of cassette tapes was what I was looking for, the stores are not selling, large blank tapes, any more Amazon carries the items, that I need online this is really great."
5,Not much to say...,I ordered these for my 74 years old father who still likes to make cassette tapes. I was just pleased that I was able to find them.
5,Maxell 7 pack,I used a tape and had no issues. Worked without any skips or hiccups in my tape player. Good sound quality on my tape player.
5,Excellent product! BUT!!!,This is an excellent product which we have used at our Church for years to record sermons etc. It is no longer available in any stores in our area. I searched far and wide for this and finally went to you never realizing there was an Amazon.ca. My brother set me up with .com. I resent the fact that you saw I was from Canada and did not advise me I could buy it cheaper from Amazon.ca. I paid twice the price by importing.
5,Good deal,Just what I needed to go with the Cassette recorder I purchased to record project meetings and the neighbor's barking dogs. Got old fashioned cassette's because digital too expensive and not needed for use purpose.
3,"Maxell UR-90 Blank Audio Cassette Tape, 7 Pack",Haven't used them yet. Same as the one above. Will advise when I do use the tapes. Don't think anything is wrong w/them
4,AUDIO CASSETTE TAPES,I use a tape recorder to interview people for my work and the sound is very good when it is time to transcribe. Glad to find a larger that 3 pack.
2,pompous and undisciplined,"yes, mr. wieseltier's family has suffered a great deal. and, yes, mr.wieseltier's underlying motives are no doubt benign. but the pomposity and arrogance of the author veritably oozes through his prose the way sap oozes from a maple tree. even by stodgy washington, d.c. standards, where mr. wieseltier apparently lives, his ability to laud socially acceptable phenomena and disdain socially questionable ones is a sight to behold. to me, as evidenced by this book, this is a man utterly lacking in vision and is at heart and soul an opportunist."
1,Yikes! Pomposity Reaches New Heights.,"What can I say. This book is apparently a reflection of the author. Unfortunately, this guy is so full of himself that his book is unreadable. You would think that the author is a combination Albert Schweitzer, Albert Einstein, Maimonides, Moses, Abraham, Noah, Adam and Adonai. Hey Leon, lighten up!"
1,A hard to understand explanation of a religious practice.,"This hard to understand and self-indulgent meditation holds a lot of promise. However, the reader gets lost in a sticky world of SAT words and muddy thoughts as soon as he/she opens the book. Good luck."
4,Read it at sunrise instead of a morning/mourning prayer.,"I read it at sunrise instead of a morning prayer. For a semi-schooled but unorthodox, secular Jew, reading Kaddish is like ""davening"" (praying) immersed in a sea of Jewish learning over a morning cup of strong coffee. Between the caffine and Wieseltier's high charged brilliance, I start the day exercised and sometimes in a lather."
4,book review,"I read this book after my mother passed away last year at the advice of a friend. It was difficult reading and it took me several weeks to finish, but ultimately it was worthwhile. I would recommend the book only to someone with a solid Jewish educational background who has also suffered the loss of a parent or some other family member and is saying the kaddish prayer daily."
2,Compels unflattering comparisons,"A disappointment. The author strives for a Continental European tone: Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, Kafka, E.M. Cioran, Milan Kundera. Alas, we're left with a flabby collection of pedestrian thoughts, self-congratulatory anecdotes, ostentatious displays of esoteric erudition and -- worst of all -- failed epigrams. Imagine the 'Dairy' section of the 'New Republic,' where Weisletter is an editor, at its most insufferable. Philip Roth ('Patrimony'), Leonard Michaels ('Sylvia,' 'I Would Have Saved Them If I Could') and Cynthia Ozick (anything) have all handled similar themes to much greater effect. An interested reader might want to start there."
1,"Overheated, over-intellectual, over-indulgent",Wieseltier is clearly a very smart man and he mourned his father's death. But this book is a mish-mash of self-indulgent windy scholarship.
5,"A Sincere, Intellectual, and Philosophical Masterpiece","If you are a religious scholar who is interested in the ancient origins of prayers offered for the dead, no academic research ever published will provide the abundance of insights that can be found on the pages of Wieseltier's ""Kaddish.""My book is now dog-eared, highlighted and underlined; and I have a lengthy collection of quotes that I carry with me and continue to review for new meaning. The trick is to read it slowly and often.""Paper is stronger than stone. The Jews knew this."""
3,Very Strongly Flavored,"This licorice has quite a strong anise flavor,and the texture is not as soft as the licoricemade by ""RJ"". It is a nice-quality product, tho'.Altho' the box does not clearly state it, the SHELF LIFEis 2 years from the stamped date on the box (and packages).Having said this, the RJ wins my vote."
5,Soft Licorice,Tubi's licorice has great licorice taste. It's soft and chewy out of the package and if you leave it exposed for awhile becomes hard on the outside but still soft inside. A great combination of texture and taste.
4,It's alright,The dye is alright it's not the best but not the worst. I guess I prefer Adore hair dye it's way cheaper than this and works 10x better
1,does nothing,"I bought this hair dye thinking it would at the very least tint my hair blue. I had bleached my head before trying the product so that i would get the best results, however all i got was darker browner hair. There was no blue coloring at all. I left it on for longer than the recommended 30 mins and nothing. All i got was blueish purple suds when i was shampooing it out.Also this isn't navy colored at all. The dye is a bluish purple similar to the ink color in pens."
2,nib broke within weeks of use,"I think this pen has a design flaw, the plastic that supports the nib is flimsy, there are two thin strips of plastic on either side of the nib, when they break, the nib won't stay down, it comes away from the base, I was able to super glue the plastic, and it seems to work ok now, but I am surprised this pen has such a flimsy base."
1,Inability of Christianity to Produce Moral Behavior,"The author's first chapter is devastating to the point of view that the route to moral behavior lies in Christianity of any flavor. The statistics that the author highlights show that the most fervent Christians behave either slightly worse or no better than the population at large in many measures of morality, such as divorce, domestic violence, racism, and sexual promiscuity. We heathens have often suspected this, so it's nice to have data that backs us up, provided by an evangelical Christian no less.Unfortunately, the rest of the book is downhill; in it, the author mostly quotes scriptures to exhort Christians to behave better. Why does the author think that he can succeed where 2,000 years of preaching has failed? In the end, what he's selling doesn't address the root of the problems."
2,Why are christians living like the rest of the world?,Because we are human!! We have the same greedy and lustful desires as everyone else. Anyone who disagrees and uses some theology on why we don't and how and why everyone can and should resist this is a hypocrite. Evangelicals are the epitomy of hypocrisy.
4,A brief but vital read for every Christian,"In an increasingly self-centered society, Christians fail to follow the admonition of the Apostle Peter to be the ""peculiar people"" (1 Peter 2:9) set aside for God's work. As Mr. Sider did in his ""Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger"", the average American Christian is taken to task for his/her lack of distinction from the rest of society. Mr. Sider provides a vast ammount of data to prove that the true tragedy of our time is the inability of Christians to act and think differently from unbelievers. The scope of this tragedy is reinforced by Mr. Sider's use of scripture to underline just where today's Christians have fallen short and how far we must go to change things. The book's shortcommings are only that some of the material is clearly reused from other books by Mr. Sider, and it is somewhat short incomparison to the depth of the subject matter."
1,How disenchanting!,"Words cannot adequately express the disappointment I feel about this book. Ms. Ewing was once my English teacher. Any respect I had for her went out the window, along with this book.Unjust male-bashing predominated the pages of this book. The authors should blame themselves for their poor choices in men, rather than the men. Maybe the authors should look within themselves and fix their own character deficiencies. Better men like better women. Instead of wasting the time and money on this book, I suggest reading Dr. Laura Schlessinger's book, _The Ten Stupid Things Women Do To Mess Up Their Lives_. She offers help to women who want to lead character-enriched lives. When that takes place, the men of character will follow. Bashing men is not the solution!"
1,Embarrassment to Canton,"Barbara Ewing, aka Canton Royalty (as she calls herself) has really gone over the edge this time. This book is not only degrating to her and her family, it is an embarrasment to Canton, Ohio. For example, one of the jokes reads: ""How do you compare a man and a tile floor? If you lay them right the first time you can walk all over them forever"" This joke (one of many) shows the public what kind of women these authors really are...and should show any other reader why these women have had such bad relationships. The true majestic people of Canton are sickened that one of their fellow citizens in this proud city could say such dirty things. The book is outrageously stupid, it is basically a book of dirty jokes. So if you are a reader who is looking for sex, lies and scandal, this is the book for you, however, the real Kings and Queens of Canton are not interested."
1,The Breakdown of the American Family,"I read ""Disenchanted Evenings"" and was quite ""disenchanted"". The middle-aged, divorced, socialites who wrote this book should be ashamed of the sexual content and embarrassing situations. Both women are well over the hill and should spend a little bit more time thinking about why they have gone through soooo many men...and less time badgerring the poor men who made the mistake of dating them. Buy this book if you are looking to glorify the breakdown of the American Family...or if you just want a good laugh at two very pathetic authors."
1,"If I could have selected no stars, I would have.","Hi I'm a 15 year old from Hudson, OH. My mom purchased this book as a recommendation from one of her friends. One day I picked it up and started reading it, I was appalled! I have never in my life read anything so juvenile. What a waste of trees. It didn't even take me 2 minutes to finish, I didn't crack a smile once. These two money hungry women must have bashed their ex-husbands past the point of common sense. It makes me want to write my own book, as a matter of fact, I might just recycle this disgrace to paper and write my own."
1,Did I read the same book?,"After reading the above reviews I was highly disappointed. This book was nothing but cliches and expressions we've all heard dozens of time. It only took me fifteen minutes to read the whole thing. Very, very disappointing."
1,Way Too Sexual,"I bought this book for a friend who was going through a rough time with her boyfriend, and when I got home I began to read it. I had to return the book because all it did was bash men. There were no helpful, serious hints on how to work in a successful relationship! The only thing there was, was vivid descriptions of the authors' many, many, bad sexual relations. I can't believe that this sort of thing is something people like to read. Buy the book if you want to hear disgusting sexual jokes, but not if you are looking for serious relationship advice. The book definity isn't a ""Survival Guide."""
3,The originator of the matriarchy myth,"Bachofen was a Swiss writer of the 19th century who is remembered for his theory that patriarchy and monogamy were preceded by matriarchy and promiscuity. He sets this matriarchy in pre-literate times in order to account for the fact that there are no written records to prove his theory. But the lack of recorded proof could just as easily be accounted for by assuming that the theory is false. The present condition of society in American inner cities resembles the matriarchy that he described. However, there is no goddess-worship in the inner city. There were goddesses in ancient times, but this doesn't prove his theory."
3,"Actron CP9180, Great Scanner, Great Price","The Scanner arrived EARLY, in great shape, but the software was not in the package. The blister pack was factory sealed. I called Actron and they are sending the software. The scanner performed well and was easy to use."
2,Lack of product support,I purchased this scanner and installed the software on my computer and was unable to download the latest updates. I tried contacting Actron support and after 2 days of not being able to talk to a representative I gave up and returned the item.
4,Feature Packed Auto Scanner,"This is my first experience with this technology, so I am a beginner at this. However the unit works as described for my needs of knowing why the check engine light is on and what the trouble code means. It lets you save the trouble codes and also lets you reset the car's unit to clear the trouble codes and shut off the check engine light.The software was a disappointment. I installed it and had error messages. I am not sure what to do with them so I gave up. It communicates successfully with my 2003 Camry. It has saved me three trips to the dealer and hundreds of dollars, so I'll keep it."
5,Actron CP9180 AutoScanner,"We bought this auto scanner to save money on car repairs. When your car is dead and the mechanic said he spent hours trying to figure out what was wrong with your car and that is a part of the $300 charge, he is actually hooking your car up to this scanner and it tells him what is wrong with your car. Well worth the money. The shipping was fast on this item, earlier than stated."
5,Excellent,Great unit. The trouble code on my pickup said it was a water temp sensor. But using this unit I was able to see that my second O2 sensor was out. Easy fix. Saved me a lot of time and trouble.
1,"Does not work with vista, Dont waste ur time","I've tried a dozen times to download this and update the scan tool, it is now frozen in Progran Mode, after a week i called customer service the first thing he said was not compatible, i asked why they dont say that up front and he said i can still use it but will not be able to use my pc with it...then why did i waste my money gettin a more expensive model so i could use my pc ??? now i have to send it back to amazon at my expense and order a different brand, you would think actron could make it compatible with vista since since XP is 2 years old"
1,worthless pc software,"Purchased this expecting reviews to be accurate...they are NOT. The scanner seems to read car ok but the software on cd does not connect device to print. After downloading latest Ver 3 fron Actron website, it does even less! Took a half an hour to download, another 12 min to reload software in scanner. I have not seen such poorly written software in many years. I've worked with PCs for more than 20 years and this is the worst I've seen."
3,mechanic,"Item works excellent as is on GM vehicles, I do not yet know if it will work with other OBDII vehicles because it doesn't come with necessary hook ups."
4,Great Diagnostic Tool,"This is a great diagnostic tool for the backyard mechanic to help diagnose complex system issues. It allows you to track and capture data with capabilities not found on basic scanners. Although not entirely entuitive on first use, when coupled with reading the owner's manual, some great functionality can used."
5,Actron Scanners Rock!,"Got the OBDII scanner in record time after ordering and put it right to work! It not only reads your trouble codes on your vehicle but gives you the diagnosis right on the screen and enables you to save the information to print out later. For the money, it's the best deal going!"
4,no computer support for apple,I am very happy with all of the functions of this product except its inability to support the mac format. The company needs to support its software for mac users. This lack of support was a surprise to me and that is why I am writing this so that others will be fully informed prior to a purchase.
1,Not Current with Technology,"This product was obsolete 5 months after I bought it. To make matters worse, Actron has taken, and is not taking, any intitiative to make it's products compatible with Vista. Due to the poor customer service ""don't care"" attitude I got from the company representatives, I recommend that your money is better spent on another brand."
3,CP9180,The CP9180 is a nice scanner however we should have waited until we could haveafforded to buy the CP9190. The scanner is a little difficult to use.
4,OBD Scanner,Used it three times and has lived up to the hype. Does exactly what it was intented for. For the price it can't be beat. Looked at many other brands and models but this works best.
3,Disappointed in the documentation,I know I bought a midrange tool. I didn't expect it to do everything but the documentation is bad. It will show you a lot of stuff like in the view data selection but the owner's manual doesn't tell you what those readings mean or what the abbreviations stand for. I called Actron and they say they don't have a list of what they are either.
4,fun and easy to use!,I found this product easy to use and it does find the problem. Great price for the value! I would recommend this to anybody. It paid for itself the first time I used it on my truck!
3,Liked the author's writing style...,"BUT about halfway through the book, the story got really tedious. When I finished reading the book I was not left feeling ""satisfied""."
2,Very disappointed.,"I read the good reviews for this novel, so gave it a try. The story seemed to start well, but then floundered some where half way through and then fell flat. The characters are one dimensional, unbelievable and unlikeable. I was left wanting more...about the characters, I mean. They just weren't tangible to me. The ending was weak. I'd skip this one."
2,Not For Me,"I can't recommend this novel. It's subject matter means to be sensational and revealing but comes across as tedious and mundane. The characters are both unsympathetic and unbelievable and, worst, uninteresting."
1,Cheap Knockoff,This blade does not come with the foil as genuine Braun blades come with. The blade was not very sharp when used for the first time. Order from a place that has the foil included so you know it's not a flea-market knockoff.
2,5000 series cutter blade,"blade hard to snap in place, not as sharp as the original blade also if you turn blade to rinse it it pops out. the price is good, but i think you should replace the foil & the blade but that costs $25 to $35.HH"
1,shame & punishment!,"Well, in my home God is many wonderful things, not a shaming and fear inspiring punisher. I was raised with all of these stories showing God's wisdom, mercy and love of the chosen people. God may have acted in a punitive way throughout biblical history, however, creating a fear in children the way this book does, is repulsive and does not teach a valuable lesson for today's standards. Children today are creative & intelligent and to tell them stories about how God is like their ""pappa"" needing to punish children who ""do not obey"" is insulting. Most definitely NOT a modern Jewish version of the important stories all youngsters should know. Perhaps this book should be re-marketed to other, more patriarchal religions who want to instill a fear of God."
3,all absurd on the eastern front,"jim umlauf's ""sorry about that,"" the story of a drafted american pacifist in vietnam, contains elements of m.a.s.h., catch 22, teahouse of the august moon, and thanks to slick the wonder dog, even rintintin. radio carrier carter's fumbling fatalism,self-effacing humor and lowkey personality create a portrait of a soldier not so much enmeshed in that war as uneasily skimming over it.The war itself appears as a series of cultural clashes and bureaucratic blunders, not unlike the the way the m.a.s.h. tv series portrayed the korean war, with most of the horror and guts kept antiseptically out of sight. this allows the author to plot his strengh, absurdist humor, at which he excels. if the book has a shortcoming, it's that the light tone is too pervasive. the reader doesn't see carter change or learn any hard lessons until the final few chapters. but then, perhaps a man can be created in a second, especially in war."
5,Excellent tea!,"I use this tea not for fasting, but because it also gives you extra energy. It is very soothing, I love the fennel in it. One of the best Yogi teas!"
5,"Sooo good, and at a great price!","This tea is fantastic, I use it usually around mid-day when I'm wanting a snack and it shuts those cravings right up. It seriously is like having a little meal; it's extremely satisfying and a very good way to manage food cravings. The taste and smell is just the best, it's mostly savory with a little bit of sweet. For me the most prominant flavors are the fennel seed (love it), licorice root, clove, ginger, pepper, and cardamom. It has the same sort of effect on me as eating a few crackers or handful of chips, it's just very satisfying. I highly recommend this to any and everyone."
4,good tea,Not sure if it really helps with curbing your appetite. I didn't notice that but I love the taste and would probably stick with the detox tea. The peach detox doesn't really taste any different than the regular detox.
3,"Okay tea, but a bit too sweet","I love yogi teas, however I have to admit that this one tasted a little bit too sweet from the stevia. I dont mean sweet in the good way....It gave a weird after taste and i really didnt enjoy it. However this is just my taste preference. If you dont mind an overwhelming stevia sweetness than this tea would be fine."
1,Ingredients?,"The ingredients listed under ""Ingredients"" are completely different from those listed in the product description. What gives?"
1,Gross taste,"I love Yogi teas (green tea kombucha, chais, peach detox). I was excited for Healthy fasting in concept, and the first cup wasn't TOO bad. I had another the next day and the taste really did not grow on me at all. It's sickly sweet in the worst way. It's okay when I hold my nose, but then I breath again and just want to scrub the taste from my mouth and throat. However, I guess it works since I lose my appetite."
1,Not realty....,"Not sure who the book is meant for, but it wasn't for my customers. "" The reason I called today is to set an appointment""You gotta be kidding. Like kissing on the first date you can do it too soon...Folks if you are new, don't buy it and watch out for his repackaged audio ""getting through"" last year it was called cold calling for success he is a 2 bit hustler..."
2,This is what's wrong with America.,"If you want to read a great review on this book, see the one written by a reviewer from Lexington. I just want to comment on a story told in the book.Mr. Schiffman writes about the time he went to visit a hospital where his top saleswoman was recovering from an illness. The saleswoman, according to Stephan, was in bad shape and had tubes coming out of her nose.So what did Stephan do?He tells her to sit up and start making calls! He claims he was concerned about her sales dropping and the saleswoman suffering.What a load of you know what! Stephan is only concerned about his bottom line and it shows throughout his book.Secondly, this is the problem with America today; we have become too greedy. We have are so obsessed with hoarding the dollar that many have lost sight of what's really important.If you want to read a great book on sales, that emphasizes value, read The Sales Bible by J. Gitomer."
3,Eh....,"Very repetative book. It could be condensed into only a few chapters. Solid info, but some of it is totally inapplicable to many salesmen (me included). Setting up the appointment is great, and it's what we all want to do as salespeople. However, for many salesman, just blindly setting up an appointment within 20 seconds of speaking with a person is foolish. There's no mention of qualifying the people you're speaking with.The book IS movitational, and offers many helpful insights, such as tracking your calls, making sure you make your calls every day, etc. It just wasn't what I expected."
2,Overly Simplistic,"After seeing this book for sale in Kinko's all over the US, I decided to read it - for free in the bookstore. I am glad that I didn't purchase it as it is far too simplistic. It does address the need for cold calling in a business-to-business sense and not for consumer telemarketing. However, it discusses basic concepts such as the probability of meeting, which leads to probability of sale. There is no discussion on the specifics of getting around gatekeepers (other than calling at odd times) or aggressive techniques such as using (""I'm going to be in the area""). Moreover, it doesn't address issues such as the nuances of dealing with senior level executives on the phone.It is not clear who could use this book as anyone who is calling should understand the basics. If you have never had to cold call, this might be for you."
2,"Well-written, but not for all","I think this book is good for salespeople targeting low-level decision-makers. I cold call on presidents and CFOs regarding real estate and the simplistic approach seems to offend more than it works. Admittedly, it works if the individual is already interested in real estate, but for example, the ""Can't we just meet?"" is usually met by ""Have you been listening to me?"" However, I do think it's concise and well-written."
5,It works!!,"If you are selling a complex solution / high end solution to senior executives, this is the best book for you. I have been in sales for five years now.The services I sell cannot be explained on the phone. By changing the objective of cold calling to getting an appointment, I have been able to add a lot more prospects in the last few weeks."
4,Cold Calling Techniques (that really work),If you want to take your sales to the next level or you're just starting in the field; this book is a must!Selling in Florida
4,Must Buy book for a Sales Person!,"As a sales person cold calling has been the part of every day routine. I am sure like me there would be lots of other people who really hate cold calling!But believe me this book is really amazing. Not only you develop an edge over the other people but your over all personality of a sales man really comes further.Frankly speaking, if you can do one good thing to improve your Sales Figures for the next months to come. Do it, buy this book right now!"
4,"Good book for traditional salespeople, not secondary services","This book was not very helpful to me, but I gave it 4 stars because it is well written and the content is appropriate for the main audience - the traditional salespersons who are making one-time sales of widgets or insurance over the phone.This book will teach you how to sounds like a good salesman and find success. But for those in the professional services industry, you want to sound like a professional peer, not a salesperson, so this book has limited use.The first third of the book is dedicated to WHY you should make a call rather than HOW to make a call. Some people may find this a waste of their time, but this section is pretty well written and has some lessons even for the most seasoned salesperson. There is one section on how actually to structure a phone call, and I found this most useful.The book is a bit dated in its approach to email and cell phones."
3,Cold Calling Technique That Really Work,"A few observations from someone whose been selling for over 13 years:1. Well, there is a section in the book that explains how bad it is to cold call using a cell phone, an absolute no-no .... yet look at the cover of the book - Hmmmmm.2. At the back of the book the author is promoting his other titles, one of which is Email Selling Techniques though Chapter 11 Titled: Email Tactics - he summarizes it in just one word: ""Don't"" !"".Getting mixed messages here.....3. The book does not address one of the most important hurdles to the cold call - reaching the decision maker. The author goes through the entire book with the assumption that the cold caller knows who they are trying reach, who the correct contact is.... in my 13+ years of selling, cold calling a major part of it, the authority is hardly ever known. Although he does talk about the gate keeper, it's a gate keeper of a person he knows he's looking to reach.I think 2.5 stars is accurate."
1,... save your money......,"The book is poorly written and full of gimmicky ideas. For example, like hanging up in the middle of a voice mail message to get a return call. Think about how you would react if someone did that to you. That is not how you go about earning the respect of prospects ..."
2,Sophomoric,You would have to be peddling a product that cost less than a 100.00 bucks to use this approach. I am not sure I would place much confidence in a review from W.V. There are far better books on the market than this book. Schiffman churns these books out to make a buck not much value to the buyer.
2,not so good,"bad quality and still make interference with your calls, you have to do some triks (aluminium foiled cover)to avoid interference. The battery life is similar to the original one."
5,WTH... excellent,"Glen Burtnik compiled a great CD this time. If you liked him with Styx, you will love him solo. The Cd also comes with a DVD of some videos of the CD.. I highly recommend this CD"
5,Must have a copy of that movie,"AAA, what a good movie, I loved it, and watched it three times, it is worth more than what Paid, It contains lots of excitement, and that nymphomaniac girl needs more than one nurse to watch her."
5,this is the best toy,I have to say that if u want buy one of this. Is better that buy it new. And if u wanted this for fusion with the dinosaur megazord. Buy the original dinosaur megazord because the copies r littler and this dragonzor is too big... i am happy with my purchase...
3,HOPED FOR SOMETHING BETTER,"I'm a stickler for accuracy, and this toy only halfway resembles The actual Dragonzord from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The new version should have been out by now. I Guess that just won't happen. Sorry folks the Dragonzord is the ultimate coolest zord ever, but this toy isn't."
2,Don't buy for the demos,The two demos on this cd add very little to your Libertines collection. There is a reason these remained demos.
3,Great but then,"I have ordered theses Vermont Style Fleecy Dog Toys frequently. Up until the last order I was very pleased. In the last order, two of three toys, per package, did not have the seem closed and I had to sew each up before I could give one to my dog."
5,Awesome tape,This is the most awesome worship tape I've ever heard. Geron and Becky Davis are some of the most gifted artists I've had the privilege of hearing. You will not regret getting this.
5,It Took A Lamb,An awesome tape!! Geron is a gifted artist and his music is uplifting and worshipful. I can't wait for another new one to come out!! Annointed music!!
1,boring music,having heard the music that Davis wrote while choir director in a large spirit filled church this is very dry and boring in comparison. I was extremely disapointed when I heard it and felt I had wasted my money. There are many more anointed artists that I would rather listen to.
1,Not worth it,"I watched this film at an anime festival and was not impressed. I usually enjoy space adventures, but this was lame. I was really turned offed my the lead character who seemed like a such a male chauvanist and there were entirely too many bikini wearing alien women. The plot was slow and confusing at times. It reminded me too much of Heavy Metal (which was lame too). I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on it. I thought it was a waste of time at the festival."
2,Dated and very cheesy!,"I took a chance when I purchased Space Adventure Cobra. I guess you can't always pick a winner. Cobra is very dated and even more cheesy. The quality of the animation was pretty good so you may consider watching this one muted with the stereo on! I would have given it a 1 star, but I did actually enjoy most of the animation."
2,Not even close,"This video/""movie"" does this awesome character no justice. The story is all cramped up, and the dubbing (as is the case with most english language anime) is terrible.It's a shame, since the TV series and manga are A+, but hey, even Cobra isn't perfect.Buy this item only if you must..."
2,Cheap looking,"This bird bath works for heating the water in the cold winter months, but that is the only good thing about it. It looks cheap was an ugly addition to a beautiful landscape. I would not recommend it if you care about how your yard looks."
3,no directions for assembly in box,We'll see how this works with the birds. Maybe you are supposed to be intuitive but there were no directions for assembly in the box and I'm just a woman.
3,birth bath is fine but the stands are too weak for a rough garden,I tried to set up the birth bath. The stand gave away by the weight of the water. I used it on concrete block
1,Greatly disappointed,I purchased this to replace another one that I had for 19 years and was damaged this summer in a hailstorm. The legs of thestand had rust on them. The stand was flimsy. I can see the wind blowing this over. The wire hooks to keep it in place are really not sufficient. I returned this the day I opened the package.
2,Had it for three years,Had this for three years...the birds love it...worked really well when it worked. It no longer works....I'll keep it for the summer waterer.The stand is really wobbley....not very well made...Thought it a bit expensive for what you received.
3,Does the trick,"This item does what it is intended to, but is has a lot of flaws too.After I soaked it for the first time i noticed an oily liquid leaking from the pouch. I didn't even have it soaking for the full amount of recommended time. Also, it didn't really seems to stay that cold and you cant re-activated the crystals until they are completely dried out which takes almost a week!"
4,Honolulu Wood,"The seller did a great job getting the Wallet out here on time. As far as the wallet itself is concerned -- clever thing, but I feel sure it really did not hit refrigerator temperature until we were well out of the tropics. We began the process 36 hours before departure, but the temperature inside the wallet did not feel cool enough. Time passed and it was time to put the medication in the wallet, run it through TSA checkpoints, and catch planes. No apparent problems with TSA or my health, so let's hope."
2,Very unhappy with the high temp performance,"Used as directed and lost 3 pens when the temperature hit 100 degrees. Foolish me, I kept thinking that the error was mine. We had a small and a large pack. The small pack was essentially worthless, the larger pack seemed to be large enough to keep for for last for a few hours. Works great as long as the temp doesn't go much over the recommended maximum temperature for your insulin and/or you keep it cool by adding some kind of ice pack. If you're expecting the answer to having to carry around all the stuff...this isn't necessarily going to be it."
4,very interesting,I got the product very quickly and then tested it out. I was very suprized on how it stayed cold and also on how long it stayed that way. Very true that it is not like having it in the frig but it did stay cool enough to keep my insulin cool. It stayed active for a good 2+ days and then when it finaly dried out it was very easy to store. I will defently try this on the next trip I take.
5,Neatest gadget.,I used to be concerned about keeping my insulin cool when traveling in the summer. Not any more. This does the job. when prepared properly in water (I use my sink); anything inside will stay cool for days.
4,Does what it says - nothing more,"I plan to use this when I go to hotel rooms that do not have a freezer for cold packs - which is somewhat typical. Tried the product at home it did was mfg said it was going to do. It would be good if I did not have to keep out of direct sunlight, but that is ok. I don't think that direct sunlight is going to be too much of a problem in hotel rooms and plane trips."
1,Falsley Advertised,I purchased this product 12-11 to keep my Insulin Pen cold prior to use. I need to keep pens below 46 F so not to start expiration dateof use within 28 days. The literature stated this cooler kept insulin cool for 45 hours. Truth is I followed activation instructions to letter and cooler does no get close to 46F. If you are looking to keep your insulin cooler than 46F so pen could be used later and not begin 28 day expiration do not buy this cooler. It is falsley advertised in Frio Literature. Truly Unsatisfactory Product and Amazon will not give full refund only partial and that is not defined.DO NOT BUY
1,Frio Useless,"I recently purchased the large Frio in anticipation of a 12 hour automobile trip, thinking it would be very convenient. I followed the instructions for activating the crystals to the letter, placed the insulin in the Frio & put it in an open tote so that it would get air and placed it in the air-conditioned car. At some point during the trip we decided to check the insulin - not cool at all! Fortunately, we had a small cooler with us and put the insulin in there. That was 10 days ago, and the gel still has not completely returned to crystal form. Briefly, the Frio is useless - don't waste your money as I did."
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased this insulin cooler for my husband who has Type 1 Diabetes. We were very excited as his insulin often becomes overheated when we travel and is no longer good. When we got the cooler we found it didn't seem to keep the insulin very cool, but gave it a shot anyway. It did not keep his insulin cool even within the first few hours of being in it and in moderate outdoor temperatures. His insulin went bad... we contacted the company and were told we must be making a mistake and their product works if you follow the instructions. They were condescending; we were following instructions and using it as directed. We contacted them again and they refused to give us a refund, stating we must be making a mistake... terrible customer service and terrible product."
3,IT IS NOT TSA APPROVED !!!!,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT WILL NO LONGER TAKE IT ON AIRPLANE TRIPS! THIS PRODUCT IS NOT TSA APPROVED! THEY PULL YOU BECAUSE IT IS A GEL EVEN THROUGH THEY CAN SEE THAT IT HAS MEDICATION INSIDE! THEY WILL RUN ALL YOUR STUFF TWICE THRU THE MACHINE, THEN DO A FULL PAT DOWN SEARCH ON YOU AND THEN TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR BAG AND SWAB IT ALL DOWN. THIS ADDS A FULL 25+ MINUTES TO GETTING THRU SECURITY. TSA WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE JUST FOLLOWING PROTOCOL.I HAVE CARRIED THIS PRODUCT EVERY WEEK FOR YEARS THRU AIRPORT SECURITY BUT DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAVE HAD THIS FULL SECURITY SCREEN EACH TIME. I WON'T CARRY IT ANY MORE. IT IS TOO MUCH HASSLE!!!!"
5,frio insulin cooling wallet,"I like the way this product works. Only one thing I learned the hard way, is do not put it in a cooler as it will swell too big and then it does not work as well from then on. We go on motorcycle trips and it work well to keep the insulin cool."
4,Most of the Best,"If you are a fan, you will find several of their best songs missing - ""Days"" and ""Sway when you walk"", for example. But to the novice, this about as good an introduction to Mark and Howard as you could come up with. Thankfully, they included ""Marmendy Hill"" - which is probably the most representative song of the entire collection.It is odd that the ""Illegal, Immoral and Fattening"" album is the one you get on CD - it's probably the worst of their catalog. The second album has always been my favorite - I LOVE the ""splat"" at the end of ""Carlos and the Bull"". II&F; wastes half the album with comedy music - not near as much fun as their shtick with the Mothers live at the Fillmore.I love these guys, and the album is definately worth a listen"
4,Inspired remix of vocals and instrumentals,"The vocals on both this disc and the Sony Classics release may be in Sanskrit, but the emotional impact is easily felt. What Beloved Recordings and Wasabees did by covering and remixing John Williams' excellent Duel of the Fates is inspired -- four different versions ranging from Breakbeat to House to Pop/Rhythm ... very good and a must have."
2,"Very disappointing, and hardly worthy of the Star Wars name.","There is so much interesting work that could have been done with John Williams' excellent source material... but this group chose instead to simple hack Duel of the Fates into unintelligible and repetitive music-kibble. The music is hardly listenable, let alone dance-able. With all the outstanding movie-theme remixes to be found these days, this one is hardly worth your effort or money. You will be dumber for having listened to it. Just stick to the original version of Duel of the Fates... available on Sony Classical."
2,Heavy,"A beautiful watch for sure, but very, very large and very, very heavy. For my wrist, it was a nonstarter."
3,My dog would have laughed at the first half of this.,"Whoever wrote this bumpersticker probably never had a dog, particularly a terrier. My 20 lb. terrier had a staff of two giving him high quality food, supplements, walks, rides to the dog park... He had an opinion about everything and made it well known. For example, in his later years, there was a place on our walk where we could veer left and take the shortcut home or veer right for another mile or so of walking. I would start to veer right, but he would be pulling as hard as he could to take the shortcut. I let him have his way on that more and more as his health declined. His other opinions included: only fools take walks in the rain, and humans have no business telling dogs what to do. The humans he lived with were most certainly his staff and not his owners."
5,More books like this should be written.,"I know thi ws book is repetitious, but I appreciate how the women are willing to stand up and let the whole world know about the nasty thing the Japanese did and are trying to cover up. If you also read "" the Rape of Nanking"", you'll get a fuller picture, this book cover only a small part. I recommend you read this. A japanese soldier publish a book about the rape of Nanking and was sentenced as defamation of the Japs Imperial army. They are trying to cover up and picture the Chinese as the history forger. Now, read this, at least you got another piece of history from another victim. let us all remember the facts when 21st century come and don't let this happen again."
5,Where else are you going to meet antique basketmakers?,"24 pages of fairly small text and interesting black & white unusual photos make this quite a good research & resource booklet. Nicely designed. It has a list of references in the back which are all earlier than 1933, so I'm guessing this vintage booklet was printed a little later than that. Desirable for that list alone. Great deal, recommended."
4,Saint Saga #22,"This full-length Saint adventure, although published in 1941, appears to be set just before the outbreak of war in Europe; it seems unlikely that Simon, Pat and Peter would be idling about on a Florida beach otherwise, even in response to an appeal for help.This is thus the last of the pre-war Saint stories, the last where the Saint is still clearly British and not a naturalised American, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last before the quality starts dropping through the floor and the plots (with a few exceptions) become formulaic.Nonetheless, Nazis and pro-Nazis are the villains of this one, which also features our old friend Hoppy Uniatz, in fine form. The incidental details of Florida, the Everglades and their denizens seem to my uninformed judgment totally convincing, and a friend of mine considers this possibly the best Saint story.P.S. For a list of — and discussion of — all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To... Guide."
3,I'm not wild about it.,"I got this for my brother for Christmas last year. He used it for MAYBE a month before switching back to his black-and-white one. The colored shavings don't magnify as well as the untinted ones, and the colors are not NEARLY as bright as they want you to think they are. It also doesn't come with any of the cool stamps my brother likes."
1,Big Disappointment,I purchased about 30 of these tapes from V.I.P Group Corp. and am extremely disappointed. The quality is so poor I had to throw out at least half of them.
2,Maxell UR Tape review,"Tape quality is very poor. One tape recorded only on 1 channel on both sides. Another recorded on 1 channel on the A side, but the B side was OK. The other two tapes record decently, but sound quality is mediocre. I use them to record from a local FM station and have tapes that have been used hundreds of times and work well. I bought some TDK tapes a couple years ago and they were so bad I thought they were counterfeit. The tape manufacturing process is poor. I have good tape decks and clean the heads periodically."
5,Longer recording time,Excellent brand product at a good price. Glad to have the extra length of recording/play time which is hard to find in stores.
5,Superfast delivery!,"For one thing it's hard finding any cassette tapes in stores that are higher than 60. So happy to find the 120's and in a 4-pack no less! The price is great and the delivery time was super fast!! I got it in 2 days! I ordered from them before last year, will order again and again as long as they have the 120 minute tapes! And thank you so much Amazon.com for carrying this product!!"
5,great value,"great value for the price,my product arrived to me in a timely manner as promised and there were no problems at all"
1,The tapes have not performed well in either of my two tape players.,"These tapes are definitely not American made. They performed terribly in both of my tape players. I have difficulty rewinding them and they sometimes stop recording for some unknown reason. I purchased them within the past month, and I have already had to throw one out because the tape jammed and got twisted. I bought Maxell in the past and have one 120 minute tape which performs very well - might I mention that it is over five years old !!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Buyer beware!,"Doesn'y record as well as TDK. You have to turn the volume way up to haer it, and as such there's hissing. Yuck! TDK may (or may not!) cost more, but it's five-star. PAN!"
2,120 minute audio tapes,"I was glad to find 120 minute tapes as they are no longer sold in stores. I need that length to tape hour long radio shows. But so far one tape was so defective I had to toss it out. It could not tape on one side and it wss too faint on the other. The others I have used so far sometimes sound too faint, especially if I record them in one machine and try to play them in another, all of them made by Sony. I hope the tapes I have not used yet are okay."
4,AUDIO TAPES,IT WAS GOOD TO FIND TAPES AT UR-120... I COULDN'T FIND THIS PRODUCT ON THE STORE SHELVES. THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN GOOD SHAPE.
4,He loved it,I bought my boyfriend this cd and he said it reminded him of the old gospel music when he was younger
3,Use rote memorization for kana,"This workbook is decent for trying to learn kana, but much of it focuses on building vocabulary and starting to learn the Japanese language, which can be done better from textbooks or other sources. I recommend printing off sheets of squares (not sure what they're called, [...]) and stroke order guides and just using those, it's really just as easy, and I think it works better than this book.Textfugu is a great (online) textbook which I recommend, I got an old Japanese for Everyone book for like $4 but if you really want to learn Japanese get Textfugu rather than taking a class."
3,good book but it has one flaw,"All in all its a good book, but for people like me who are the worst drawers on planet earth its hard to draw the symbols. of course it well made and they show the stroke order, but if you are as bad as me you need dottet lines you can follow to go over it with a pen. you know like the paint books for kids...."
2,Not for Complete Beginner,"I was greatly disappointed in this book.It does NOT have:Answer keynor examplesYes it has a lot of practice; but I am a complete beginner trying to learn on my own without a class. Therefore, I need examples and an answer key to know that I am on the right track - which are missing from this book.I recommend instead: Easy HiraganaEasy Hiragana: First Steps to Basic Japanese Writing (Passport Books)"
2,"'Limited' information, even for a small book like this","I always start reading 'tutorial' books by examining the table of contents. This looked promising. But An hour and a half or so later I finished the last page feeling disappointed. Expanders and Gates are mentioned only briefly, while the rest of the book deals with compressors and limiters. What can you tell? Most of the material is repeated 4 times or more. I think this whole book could easiliy be rewritten in 40 pages. As for the CD examples: some are helpfull, but they are most of the time not very convincing."
4,worth the dough,"this gadget bag is really good for any gadgets... cameras, camcorders, i even found myself using it for water bottles and books. its worth the hefty price, durable and easy to clean with plenty of room, this thing keeps your gadgets safe through anything. its great!"
5,"Excellent fan, I discovered too late.","I didn't know how good this guy was until we bought two similar-looking fans at a local discount store. The two we bought (and they were only about $7.00 cheaper per unit) are noisy, whistling, clicking irritants. They're out of the house and off to Goodwill as soon as the two new Lakewoods I'm ordering arrive. The Lakewood has been quiet, powerful, sturdy, and maintenance free for the year or so I've had it."
1,DO NOT BUY!...Ships from and sold by BuyOnlineNow,"DO NOT BUY THIS FAN (Lakewood HV-9) IF THE AMAZON MERCHANT IS (Ships from and sold by)""BuyOnlineNow"".BuyOnlineNow DOES NOT CARRY THIS FAN. I BOUGHT THE HV-9 AND THEY SHIPPED ME A DIFFERENT, CHEAPER FAN. THERE IS A GLITCH IN THE MODEL NO./ORDERING INFO. BEWARE: YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THE BLACK/CHROME FAN SHOWN."
3,"Nice guy but somewhat disjointed book, but still enjoyable","Charlie D was clearly a great guy. Reading of his struggle with cancer and how he dealt with it was the most inspiring part. Also the testimonial from his former girlfriend was enjoyable. Unfortunately, the writer was very jumpy and didn't consistently tell the story. The parts on trading were particularly boring and not helpful.I did enjoy the book based on the personality of Charlie D which comes thru along with the anecdotal stories. Be prepared to skim the slow parts."
2,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful telephone, but it has average sound reception. The receiver part, with the speaking and hearing functions quickly came apart, without any threads to tighten. It has been repeatedly glued and has to be treated fragilely so it won't come apart completely."
3,Nice Phone But......,After about a month the speaking end ceased to work.We can hear the caller but they cannot hear us.Too bad. Now the phone is a nice paper weight with no way to fix it.
3,The picture on the page was different than what I had received,"It is a lovely product, but wasn't what I was expecting. But it is still a very lovely product. I would buy it if I had a use for it."
4,Unique piece,"I love this wine rack, I've never seen anything like this before. It always gets compliments when people come to my house. Though it is not made of real antlers, it does look real. However the reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it is a little complicated to figure out how the bottles go into the rack without a picture."
1,Dry and predictable,"Once again they magically fell in love at first sight without knowing anything about each other. He didn't have one single fault which is fake and like living in fairy land. Even a small one would have made him more human instead of like some perfect god that is better than everyone. She gave up every aspect of her life for him and he gave up nothing. It's getting kind of old and boring very quickly. If you have read one of her books you have read all of them, they never change."
5,JUDGE GABRANTH!,Alright this figure is just excellent its got great detail its very durable overall the only problem i had with it some of his armor pieces kept falling off but beside that i highly recommend it!
4,good stuff,this product is good should have bought 3 instead. It works like a gem and really does what I want it to do.
1,Appallingly poor quality,A cheap unit and poor quality parts. You get what you pay for. The CD players in this product are exceedingly unreliable. I am on my second unit. One CD player immediately failed in the first and both CD players have now failed in the second (within 2 months of delivery). Terrible! I will look to another manufacturer for my next mixing console.
2,ON 2 Tha Next One!!,"Man, Let me get right to tha point, I'm on my second Numark Cd Mix (I previously had the Cd Mix1). I currently have the Cd Mix2. The reason I have a Cd2 is because the Cd Mix1 started freezin up one the left side and not playing. Also, it would play a song for about a minute and then just stop or start over again in the middle of a song. How embarassing!! I'm currently having the same problem but on the right side this time with my Cd Mix2. So, u know I'm not going to buy or try the Cd Mix3 because this time both cd sides probably will start freezin up and starting over. I wonder about the CD MixDeck by Numark, HMMMn? for $699 w/o a case It betta play Cassettes! LOL! Come on Numark lets get it Together! Oh yeah, I almost forgot, Please purchase the Warranty!!! if u still plan to buy a Numark product; don't worry u will use and need it!!"
4,Great Costume for Toddler,"This costume is a great for halloween, but the ears do not stick up like the picture shows."
4,Wonderful book,"This was a beautiful book about growing in prayer and virtue. I gave it to my children to read also, it was written simply but profoundly and helps answer many questions that we ponder in life."
4,"Energy, excitement and intimacy","This points to the fact that Jesus is Savior and Lord. I hear a heart cry to be revived and renewed. God still heals today, revival IS here, just open yourself up to it and receive what God has for you. It's a time to be excited about what God is doing."
5,Exactly what I ordered!,"This book is a great supplement to the official blue book. They walk you through steps that are extremely confusing. If you take the time and do the problems in the workbook, actually using the Blue Book will be a breeze! The book was exactly what I ordered. It was in great condition, no markings, and the newest edition. The book shipped very quickly- I was definitely pleased and would order again."
5,Excellent and Disturbing,"This is a thought-provoking and deeply disturbing film that examines the confrontation between weak minds and an uncaring world. Tom McCamus turns in a flawless performance as Henry Adler, the non-entity actor who wins a part in a cop show. At first, he draws strength from his macho cop character, but then - well, I won't say any more. See it for yourself - at least twice. This one is bizarre, but it's worth the trouble. Recommended."
2,Should have been better,"The story seemed interesting to me which is why I picked up this DVD, but it fell short of my expectations. McCamus does a decent job in the lead role, but that's about it. The story is about an actor who plays a cop. He becomes so obsesses in his part that he starts acting out his role in the streets. The scenarios that he was put in were dull and the plot was undeveloped. Overall there was nothing new and nothing special."
3,Part 2 Not Necessary,I was truly looking forward to seeing the entire cast and how they moved forward. Though it showed 2 of the characters it didn't capture me they way part 1 did. It pays sometimes to leave a good thing alone and on this movie it was better to be left at one.
3,No more vocals!,"The instrumental tracks on this album are beautiful. The vocals on the tracks that have them are somewhat intrusive, and often suffer that favorite illness of electronica: excessive repetition. Add to that the questionable English skills of the songwriter and you end up with a big detraction. Check out Blumfeld's L'etat Et Moi if you want amazing German vocal stuff. I still recommend the album to those who share my taste, but think if it were 100% instrumental it would be fantastic."
2,bleh,"after watching my sim read a book and learn something, I realized I'd rather read a book and learn something.game is repetitive and needs some sort of an end. I like building the houses. I cheat a lot. rosebud;!;! :)the game I bought off a seller on here as new had a used serial number so I couldn't register on the website. not giving the two star rating because of that though, just a warning to potential buyers."
4,Pretty Good...,"I just got this game yesterday on Christmas morning. I played it instantly because me and my friend always play it at her house. Well, I didn't have to install it because we brought my friend's game over here and installed it here too. That way, when I got the game I wouldn't have to. Overall, the game was pretty good. I mean, it gets boring after at least an hour of gameplay and in the morning if your sims have jobs they only have a minute to take a shower, have a quick breakfast change for work and get out the door by nine. Also, WARNING! Zombies DO come out of the ground. They are all green so yu know what to look out for. Luckily they dont eat your sims brains but they do try. I found that out while my sim jessica was mourning at the graveyard next to their house."
4,The Sims,"Another great Sim game is the Sims. Its fun intresting, and teches you about people. Its not a great game for young kids because it has nudity in it, but besides that its a really good game for all ages."
5,The ultimate time-waster,"Prepare to become addicted. There is something immensely satisfying in creating your own little world, replete with custom-tailored characters living in houses that you build especially for them. The most engaging part of the game is the innate humanness of the characters--their free will, the cadences of their Sim language, and the interaction of their personality characteristics with their career trajectories and personal relationships."
5,Why I like this Game,"First of all, The Sims is a great game. You can be a engineerer, builder, and basically anything you want. Personally, I like to use money cheats in games, and this one has some. I like how you can pick furniture and lots and make a miserable life for your sims or not."
5,"Aack, I can't stop!","This is a very addictive game. It is the most fun you can have with a computer. I have played SimCity which I thought was great, but The Sims just blows everything else out of the water. The Sims are much more interesting than the real people in my life. The game was even named by Entertainment Weekly as the best reason to lose your job. Hey, a few more late nights with my Sims, and I might not be able to stay awake at work anymore."
4,Good or Bad?,"The first time I played Sims it was so cool. I have never played a game like that before. Every time I played it, I learned something new. But after awhile, the game started to get boring. You have to keep the sims(the characters) happy all the time. It's a real nuisance. But, the graphics are great and the stuff they have is so realistic. Pretty much, the game's great."
4,A Book to Make You Think,"Since the finding of the tomb of the boy King by Howard Carter much has been written about Tutankhamen, most of it complete rubbish regarding tomb curses and other mumbo jumbo. This book takes a serious look at the subject, sometimes from a different angle to the conventional academic theories, so far put forth. For anyone interested in the subject of Tutankhamen, or in Egyptology in general this book is a good read. If you do not agree with the theories put forth by the author so be it, but that is not a good reason for avoiding reading the book. Much of the ancient past is there to debate, because much of it is based on opinion, educated opinion yes, but after all none of us were there to confirm or deny it. This book stimulates the mind and that cannot be a bad thing."
4,a glimpse of 18th dynasty Egypt.,"This book is very interesting, showing us a glimpse of life in 18th dynasty Egyptian times. I have always been interested in ancient cultures, especially Egypt, and this book has given me an insight into what life was really like in these times, rather than the sanitised version often seen in children's books."
3,Some profound bits amidst a huge mass of drivel,"Sartre could have been more concise with his words, so I didn't have to toil so painfully through such a large body of text. I would say that Sartre is incredibly over-rated, but he did have some very meaningful tid-bits that made the drudgery worth it-- so I gave it 3 stars instead of two."
4,Warda - Andah Alaek,"Andah Alaek is one of the good songs that sung by Warda. Written by Mohammad Hamza dan composed by Mohammed Abdel Wahab, the song is so beautiful that you don't ever realised that you've just listened to it for nearly an hour. Buy this CD and I believe you will never regret..."
5,Love this book!,"Michael Scott Horton exalts the sovereignty of God in this excellent work. I highly recommend this book and believe it will make a powerful contribution to a clearer understanding of the Biblical concept of ""grace."" This is no dry and humorless book ... each chapter is illustrated and comes with questions for further consideration. Good for Bible study groups or individual study."
5,This book changed my life!,"If you have been caught in the grip of legalism, this book can show you the way out, without going to the excess of libertinism. Must reading for new and mature Christians."
1,Holy Smokes,"Be aware.....they will ship you six gallons of this stuff.The review is asking me about ""how much fun is this toy"" and what not like ammonia hydroxide is a toy. Oh well....I have enough ammonia to last 4 lifetimes now :)"
2,"Limited use opportunities, not collectible artwork-wise, super-simple rules","I probably shouldn't review this, since I've never played it, but I did buy it, and Amazon keeps begging me to `be the first.' As a Lovecraft fan, I ordered this on reflex without much research. Only after it arrived did I notice the fine print that it requires a room full of people to play - there are no two-person or `solitaire' rule sets - it's not that kind of game. In fact, the cards are hardly necessary at all - after reading the rules you realize that you can practically play this game by just ripping some strips of paper and handing them around. The fun, it appears, comes from it being a social activity and the cards are very simple props. Sadly, I can't remember the last time I had a dozen Lovecraft fans all in one room at one time, looking to play a party game, so this will probably just sit on the shelf forever."
3,i agree,"as usual, her best album is the one with whodoeslisalike and a fab album. so instead we get teh trash album of hers and not the one with her best. Fool Around (1978) should be her CD and we'd all be happy and she'd have a 5star review. Leave it to management to make sure brains stay out the equation of marketing most all the great obscure acts. I could list many other cases, but for now. I agree - where is Fool Around (1978)."
2,Boy Am I P@#$%d,"This might be better than 2 stars. I don't know because I haven't stopped fuming yet. I am in a band that has played Rachel Sweet's tune ""Tonight"" for years. It has always been well received by audiences. Trouble is, I have no idea what happened to the copy of the cassette from which I first heard the song. I have been searching for it for years. It finally shows up on this compilation and I'm elated. Problem is, it's not available. I had to buy it used from someone on this site. So I plops me money down and the person sends me the CD. Problem is, that song isn't on the CD. Amazon got the song list wrong. Yes, it has some of her other cool tunes such as ""Who Does Lisa Like"", ""Pin a Medal on Mary"" and ""Everlasting Love"" But I'm not looking for those songs. I'm looking for ""Tonight."" So...once I stop being p@#$%d-Off, I might review it again."
1,You must be kidding,I found the video to be of very poor quality. The loud piano music was anything but relaxing. I did get a laugh at the shots of what looked like doll house furniture. There are much better videos available though usually more expensive than this one.
3,review of seasons,I use this dvd at my massage studio. I play it in the lobby for the clients waiting. The picture is very clear and good quality. It has a varity of photos (still and moving). I haven't listened to the music on it. We play a spa channel on the radio and turn down the tv volume. The dvd does not offer a loop of repeat so you will have to have that function on your remote/player. Over all it was a good choice.
4,Review,I have had this product for little over a month. I've had no problems at all. I guess I just wish you could add more pages to it.
2,Okay,The only reason I gave this movie two stars was because of the two songs Garland sang which were Everbody Sing and Dear Mr. Gable:You Made Me Love You.Garland was definetly something this movie would have terriable without her.
4,"Fun, splendid dancing, Tucker, Garland!","Yes, the plot leaves a few questions unanswered such as where did Powell's character learn to dance like that on a farm--but then again, who cares? The film is great fun--an awesome display of Powell's dancing capabilities! Judy Garland is wonderful in the ""Everybody Sing"" number and ""Dear Mister Gable"" is a classic not to be missed. It was also a treat to watch Sophie Tucker on the screen! Get this movie--it's harder to find for a GOOD reason!"
1,So Awful It's Wonderful,"Don't watch the movie, just go about your daily business at home and listen to it. You will find yourself, laughing, smiling, and singing along. For me, the best part of all was not just a young and wonderful Judy Garland, but an aging and still wonderful Sophie Tucker who could still belt out ""Some of these days!"" Now that's something you won't see everyday.J.H. CohenNYC"
5,Very good recording!,"Consider this LP was orginally recorded in the early 60's, the recording quality is really outstanding to say the least. If you like Brian Hyland, you must have this!"
3,one singer - two eras,this cd is typical of the record companies - It is aimed at the general 'oldie' lover but not the dyed-in-the-wool fan. It is an album of two halves: pre & post beatles material - i certainly know what i prefer!!. Where are the missing early songs including flipsides and LP tracks? - Brian Hyland made his name as one of the teen idols and this material should be kept separately from the later songs. This could be said of many similar artists i.e. Tommy Roe and Lou Christie - at least 'Rosemary' was included - oh for the complete recordings to 1963.
2,Too much remastered,The music and the album are great. But I had a couple of more albums of Brian Hyland. I played same songs from the same starting points. The sound on this album is flat. It is cleaner but flat. Not a good remaster.
4,Brian Hylands Greatest: a Treasure,"More than bringing back those good old days, we have a singer with a sweet voice.Yes, he can sing and it is a wonder that he never became a big star that would be very familiar, say like Frankie Avalon. Maybe he should of made movies too. All the songs are sing a long and catchy and the one thing I find interesting is that Brian's career rocketed with Itsy Bitsy teeny-weeny and finished with a big hit Gypsy Woman. He opened and closed a full ten years 1960-70. Please dont forget all the songs in-between. The Joker went Wild is my Fav.Thank You Brian Hyland for the hits."
2,Buyer Beware,"This was very inexpensive and it showed in the quality. The 'amp' was little more than a small speaker w/ a line-in hole. The guitar had some rough edges and scratches, but we got what we paid for. Had I to do it again I'd go the music store route. Little difference in price and w/ an instrument, perception of the potential player is oh so important - especially in a young one."
1,terrible for lashes,"I have been getting my lashes tinted for several years now and when I saw this product I thought why not? I could do it myself and save some $$ at the salon. Boy was I wrong!!! The dye tinted everything but my lashes-it left terrible stains on the skin around my eyes and the ""remover"" they send does not work at all. Plus it did not leave any color on my lashes at all. I tried the product several times thinking maybe I am just doing it wrong but no go. It was a total bust and does not work on lashes. Save you money and go to the salon!"
3,"Good for brows, so-so for lashes","Dyes my brows fine. Dyes my upper lashes okay. Doesn't dye my lower lashes at all. Disappointing, considering the price."
2,"Does work, but not for long.","This product was somewhat difficult to apply and probably took around an hour for my eyelashes. The reason being is I had to repeat the process 4x over to get my lashes black. Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes. In the end this only lasted a few weeks. I purchased in store and ended up returning the product. Not worth my time in my opinion, also not worth the chemical fumes being near my eye. My eyes did not water or sting however you definitely know that there are bad chemicals near your eyes."
5,Lash and Brow tint,This product works very well. It does a good job of dying brows and lashes and is easy to apply. There is a stain remover included that takes off the excess. It is great for those who need mascara and a pencil to darken lashes and brows. It is really good in the summer...it doesn't wash off in the pool or from sweating. I highly recommend this product.
4,Great!,"My brows get lighter from the arch outwards. I wanted to deepen the color of those hairs. This product worked great! 1st apply the liquid #1 and wait 3 min. Then apply liquid #2. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is they don't tell you how long to leave on liquid #2. After 10 seconds or so, I washed it off. The color took well but I decided to do a 2nd application. If your skin takes the dye don't panic. Take a cotton pad and put some of the color remover on it and give a good firm rub to each brow. The color came off my skin and stayed on the hairs. To play it safe, do this when you don't have any plans to go out. Just in case you wind up with some on your skin. It will come off in a day or 2. Just like hair dye does."
1,Blond lashes,I have been getting my eyelashes dyed for years. I was happy to find out there are products on the market that I can use to dye my own eyelashes. I have light blond lashes. This product did not work for me at all. Waste of money. Will try another product.
3,Petmate,"It seems to work okay. Don't always know when to change it. Need to order more, however. May be time to get a new Petmate."
4,Filters,Works well and keeps the water clean and fresh. Will be ordering another packet soon for the cat's water dish.
2,It will block the flow of the water,"I have found the leaking problem for the fountain. It is the filter. It will somehow block the flow of the water, so the water starts to accumulate and then you have a leak."
3,Does what it says it does,"My cat seems to like the water at least a good as before, if not better. I can't really say much more beyond that, I don't drink the water that goes through the filter."
5,Good filter,"I use the petmate freshflow fountain for my bunnies. I have two. They loooooooooooove the fountain and drink often because it oxygenates the water and it's not stale or stagnant. :)Filters last about 90 days for me.I clean my petmate fountain once every week for the sake of cleanliness and prevention of hard water on the sides as well as slime.My bunnies don't drool like dogs do, so maybe that'a a factor that my fountain is cleaner and the filter last 90 days."
2,Block too easily,We got these to use with the petmate drinking fountain we previously bought. We have a relatively high level of chlorination in our water and my fiancee is convinced that the cats don't like it (even though they happily drink from any toilet in the house).The issue we ran into is that after around a week the carbon starts to clump together. This massively reduces the flow through the filter and causes the water to back up behind it. This then causes the fountain to become very noisy.I don't know if this is a recurring problem with all users but the lifespan on these things is supposed to be a month so we're not doing so well. I have another 5 to use so we'll get through them then probably switch to using filtered water. (or toilet water if my fiancee isn't looking)
3,"Nice, but not necessary","These filters don't last as long as the manufacturer states, but when they are obviously in the need to throw out stage, they do still filter out lint, hair and larger particles. My cats don't seem to notice though whether the fountain has them in use or not.We did find out after running out of filters for the aquarium that these can be used in a pinch!"
2,Probably not that effective.,"Ok so I have not been using the unit that these go with for too long, just got it today. But just based on my feeling of the product, I highly doubt that they are very effective in actually filtering anything other than lint or other large debris. Its a loose felt material on the outside. The inside of it feels to be some stiff plastic or thin metal of some sort to hold the shape, with some pieces of carbon or charcoal in there. There are not a lot of actual carbon or charcoal chunks like you would see in a brita filter, and they do not do anything but sit at the bottom of the ""filter"" so I honestly dont see how they could do anything. We have a brita filter on our sink, so when I fill the unit, I use that and will use the rest of the 4 filters I got for the unit, but do not believe I will be purchasing more."
1,Useless product does not fit! whatever happened to the sturdy filters they used to make before!,This is the most useless product ever! Total waste of money! A) It is flimsy B) It doesn't even fit in the Petmate fountain (model 24860). I have asked for a full-refund! If I can't get the old-filter it is going to make my water fountain useless. Or I will have to start making my own! But this is a total waste of money.
4,Stock up,"If you have the Fresh Flow fountain unit, it's not a bad idea to keep a few extra of these around. I only use the fountain when we're going out of town-- I tried to use it daily, my my stone freak of a cat splashes all the water out onto the floor, contaminating what's left (and in a mold-prone area like Michigan, the filter then gunks up very quickly). Cat #2 gets the short end of the stick on this one. Design vs. application: great design, but we really can't use it like we'd prefer."
4,Nice idea.,"I definitely like the idea of my cats drinking clean water. This Freshflow works well - although it is taking my cats some time to get used to the constant flow ! They don't seem to have much of a preference between this and the regular, unfiltered water though. I think you would have to replace all water bowls with these for it to fit the purpose."
3,Handy but with cheap button,"Works great and the price is right but very soon after I got it the Trigger button broke(only cosmetic and is still functional). I'm sure the company would replace it but I'm not too concerned with looks and a little duct tape around the handle fixed it nicely. Overall i like it but a little more durability built into a ""tool"" would be nice."
2,Best digestive enzymes?,"I ordered ""Doctor's Best Digestive Enzymes"" supplement so that I might have better digestion, less gas, and less constipation. None of these symptoms have improved so I will not order more of this product. I will contact my doctor to see if she can recommend something for remedy."
1,There are better options,I have used a variety of digestive enzymes from different manufacturers including the professional lines like Douglas and retail brands sold at WholeFoods. These were the least effective of all that I have tried. To compensate I increased the number of tablets at meals which made me go through them pretty quickly.
2,I like Integra's Digezyme FAR better,"Regardless of what is on the label, who knows how these are processed & handled???Integra's Digezyme is FAR better & works... I'm not sure these are doing a whole lot for me, but then I need a high-powered enzyme mix/balance that works for me & this just doesn't do it for me, but everyone is different, so these might be fine for someone else!"
3,"OK, but not comprehensive enough","I have discovered that this enzyme doesn't help me with the metabolism of carbohydrates, which is my biggest challenge. Otherwise, it's an OK supplement."
5,Hypnosis in Dentistry by Roger Simpson,"Excellent readable, practical overview of hypnosis and how it is really used in Dentistry. No other as brief yet comprehensive. All dentists should own a copy - plus any dental ""cowards"" or patients who want a safe, comfortable visit. Especially good for use with children and youth. Should be reprinted."
3,Pretty Good,"The Title Cut is Cool Let's Get Personal,Repeat The Beat is tight.How do You Stop is alright.I'm Glad Living In America Brought Me Back Cuz His Musical Importance SHould Never be FOrgotten but the song got Played way too much.The Problem with the Disc is that it's SOmebody else just Giving James James Doing anything really different.it has it's Moments but nothing Like His 50's,60's,&&70's Funk Pioneering Sound."
5,Pleasant to do. Efficient time-wise. And it works.,I bought this a while ago. I am now doing it consistently and the results are great. I came back to read the reviews and it really has worked for a lot of people. It is working for me. The familiarity with the facial muscles that you gain from this helps you to be in better control of your face and expressions. I just pop over to the full routine and am done in no time. Very efficient and excellent DVD.
5,Does It Work?,"Okay, just got it in the mail today and did the introduction program. The introduction is a detailed instruction on how to do the facial moves. My face already feels worked out and uplifted. I am sure I will see fantastic results from doing these exercises. I look young for my age but want to keep my good looks up. I believe that anyone who wants to preserve or improve themselves to a more youthful appearance will adore this video. I will keep it by my beside and do the 20 Minutes Complete Facial Workout upon retiring each evening. Boy, my face feel tingly and tight. Great video, Tal!"
3,"Nice production, but that's pretty much it.","I rated this program three stars for three reasons:1. Production quality is great, as mentioned. (The models certainly don't need facial exercise though - maybe that's why the exercises are so weak. Honestly, if you're going to take the time out of your day, choose something that works a little faster and better!)2. The price is right.3. The exercises, while nothing special, are at least a place to start a facial exercise regimen.However, you should do yourself a favor and get a program that uses resistance against your facial muscles, like FlexEffect or Ageless if You Dare (which I use and LOVE)."
4,An easy way to take care of your facial muscles,I found this DVD easy to follow and the workout makes you face muscle feel good. I've been doing this workout for a couple of weeks and my face feels better after doing the exercises and a little firmer.
1,Not enough resistance to create dramatic change!!!,Pretty models are not important to me when learning facial exercises. I want a concise program focused on the exercises and enough resistance to create dramatic changes in my facial muscles. I exercise my body and feel that exercising my face is equally important. This program is too long and doesn't provide enough facial changes.
5,"Wow, I was really impressed...","I have all facial exercise DVD's but this one is amazingly well detailed.It explains and shows all the exercises in a simple way, both in 3d animation and live models. Finally a DVD that does not look like it was made at home.It also has a full segment at the end that is real easy to followand you can feel all your face muscles working intensely.I recommend it dearly.Alex"
4,good introduction to using S-Plus,"This is a fantastic book on using S-Plus. I would have given it 5 stars had its treatment been given in a more clear way. Nonetheless the S language is well presented and many statistical analyses are sampled using S-Plus. In fact, this is also a strong applied stats book, with S code given for each topic."
2,not the best,"Although I read a little French and have read books by him before, this one failed to keep me reading at every available minute to the finish. Could be my frame of mind but I did not hink it wa one of his better novels."
4,Classic Dumas,Interesting story. It follows his general formula of problems with the rich aristocracy and nobility in France. Interesting twist as a finish.
4,I recommend it!,"The combination of photos, measured drawings, and brief commentary makes this a great resource for designers and craftspeople. On the down side, the drawings are at weird scales (like 0'-1 3/8"" = 1'-0""), so if you want to draft from them, you'll have to get crazy with the photocopier or scanner. The organization could be a little tighter-- there's a stool in the table section--, and the pieces aren't quite in chronological order. Still, the details are clear, and the catalog is fairly good. One hundred and two photos! Over 500 drawings! (I think this includes each view/detail.)It's a Dover book! You're not going to find this information for less."
5,Encyclopedic,"Wilkinson's treatment of the pantheon of Egyptian dieties is truly encyclopedic. Beginning with dieties of the pre-dynastic era, he not only provides information about the specific gods and goddesses, but the book is rich with prints of reliefs and statues of them. I am not an Eyptologist, but I do teach a survey on ancient civilzations. This book has been of tremendous value in ""filling in"" minutae and details of Egyptian religion and, by extension, Egyptian society. Recommended."
5,Review of Wilkinson's 'Complete Gods and Goddesses',"This is a wonderful presentation of ancient Egyptian religion. Wilkinson opens with a detailed account of religious practice and the ritual of death, tracing its regional variants and historical development. Next, he presents a complete, detailed encyclopedia of the pantheon. Each entry features information on the mythology, artistic representations and worship of the deity. The book is complete, thorough and easy to read and reference."
3,Some controversial figures,"As I first starting reading this book, I noticed the dates were very very advanced from any other dates that I had seen with the corrosponding event. Sadly, after that I didn't really take in things said in the book to be of researched value. But it does have useful maps, and pictures of present Egypt to compare with drawings of ancient Egypt."
3,Faust - 'Patchwork' (Staubgold),"With a total of twenty tracks here, each averaging two minutes in length, 'Patchwork' is most certainly NOT for Faust newcomers. In fact, some long-time fans may have a problem with it. Tunes here are previously unreleased snippets and actual finished songs that would originate anywhere from 1971 to 2002. After reading the liner notes, I guess we can be glad that original members organist Hans Joachim Irmler and drummer Werner Diermaier were personally involved in this project. The songs are mostly upbeat, a couple that I thought somewhat stood out were ""A Seventies Event"", ""Jassie"" and ""Stretch Out"". Super-nice job on the digipack cover and the 16-page booklet. Fussy krautrock fans may not go nuts over this CD, but patient listeners should get some enjoyment out of it. Audiophiles could easily have a field day with 'Patchwork'. Worth checking out."
4,Order arrived safe and on time. It look like will satisfy my needs,Order arrived safe and on time. It look like will satisfy my needs for my next scuba trip. Best regards
5,easy to find,I had trouble finding these at the dive shops but it is a very good price on line and always in stock.
2,$.6.49 To Mail One CD?,"Amazon allows us sellers a set amount for shipping. With books, it's usually either $2.99 or $3.99. Some books are so heavy that even shipping it by Book rate will cost us more than that. But when I saw this I was floored. $6.49 to ship one little CD-ROM? That's incredible! At most it will cost no more than $2.00 and some change, by First Class! So, tell me; Where is the logic? I think I will start selling this one again. Even if I only get the going price ($0.01?) I'll make money on it.Oh, and it's a good CD, with lots of help for your finances."
3,Raw's Fifteen Years,"The WWE was in a no win position here because on one hand if they put full matches on here, there would need to be a couple more disks, which would've increased price. By clipping down matches you get three disks, but a rightfully angered fan base who spent hard earned money on this set. Personally, I would rather have complete matches That being said, the selection of what constitues Best particularly on the disks for the Attitude Era and beyond is a little underwhelming Mean Street Posse v. Patterson & Brisco was not a best moment for me at least and even some of the bigger moments are clipped down. But there's no way to accomadate everyone's taste because if they release full season sets of RAW to get complete matches i'm not sure i'd have the patience to sit through all the bad stuff to gleam the few gems."
4,"Great DVD, but.......","This is a great dvd, no question about it. I just have one small problem with it. They advertise the McMahon paternity test on, not only the back of the box, but on the back of the the case of the third dvd box. However, it's nowhere to be found on the dvd. Can someone please explain that to me???? Why have it on the box or the dvd case in the first place?????"
2,let down also,"I gotta admit, i was let down also. I am a die-hard 30+ year wrestling fan. I crave dvd footage of all the great raw matches. However, while the quality of the video is A+, the fact that the matches are clipped to death is a MAJOR letdown. Year, it brought back great memories, but its hard to watch when the matches dont flow because they are clipped to death! The pop-ups are VERY distracting also..! What could have been a great set was runied by the dvd presentation...IF WWE starts making more sets based on this dvd presentation, then their sales will start dropping! I did like the fact that they made it a box set with 3 slimline dvd cases for the discs, but for me the content on the discs and the way its presented is the most important thing!.."
2,Big let down..,I was really looking forward to this DVD..I picked it up read the back i thought it was going to be great.Popped it in an was very surpised to see some of the matches i wanted to see the most were clipped..The Flair Perfect match from 1993 was chopped to shreds.HBK VS Owen boom edited alot..In this day an age of DVDs its all about showing complete versions of shows..An this DVD killed the concept out right.I would glady pay more for a set if they had to include another dvd or two to make the matches complete.On top of all this they have these crappy (huge) popups on the screen telling you things you already know or could care less about..WWE sets back the dvd gimmick ten years with this set.
4,Oh the memories!,"I think this was a well put together dvd. It had alot of favorite moment's to choose from. The second disc was my favorite featuring mostly the ""Attitude Era"". I also liked the pop-ups they were fun. If you love Monday Night Raw in the WWE treat yourself to some Raw history."
3,"Nice, but where's the wrestling?","This is a very good collection of highlights from Raw's run and will pacify WWE fans with its inexpensive price, but this can hardly be considered a definitive collection.While it gives the fan a warm feeling to see some of these moments again in (largely) unedited form, the DVD sacrifices a lot of really excellent matches for 'segments', some of which are just stupid. (Did anyone really need to see Mean Street Posse VS. The Stooges, or Musical Chairs with Eugene?).The few matches that are picked are good, but seem totally random. Perhaps in the future a 'Best Matches' Compilation can be released.BTW, while some fans have complained about segments being edited or about the pop-ups, I did not find either to be a major distraction. With this collection being over 9 hours, there is only so much footage that can be shown, and frankly, I didn't find it obvious what was edited and what wasn't."
2,raw fifteen year anniversary,"I am really looking forward to this release. Hopefully, they will make up for the lack of extras in the Monday Night War and 10 year anniversary DVD's. 3 discs, a lot of space to fill. We need great moments like rock this is your life, jericho's debut, austin beer bash, etc. and good matches to bad angle vs benoit cage match wont happen."
4,Was Worth The Purchase,"I bought this DVD and I enjoy it quite a bit. It was nice to relive some of the great moments in RAW history. There were a few moments I thought was straight up random and didn't really deserve to be in there. As for the match selection, I would've gone for better ones. Disc 1 had a few nice match on there. I enjoy the Bret Hart/123 Kid match, Marty Jannetty/Shawn Michaels match, and Bulldog/Owen match. Disc 2 didn't have any match memorable. Disc 3 had 4 matches that I enjoy. So overall it's a must own for any new or old fans. I assume the pop-ups were for the new fans who didn't know. I know some of us get annoy by those because we have been watching wrestling like forever and just go, ""what else is new?"" But I wasn't annoy by it. There were some things I didn't knew and was like ""OH!"" So overall, it's worth the purchase."
5,Great gift item,"Gave this to my trainer for Christmas. It's got tons of great ideas for names. It also is divided up in chapters with names for horses based on color, personality traits, size and a few other categories."
3,"Lots of names, nothing new","After getting tired of hearing the same horse names over and over, I thought I would give this book a try for naming our foals. I used this book more for inspiration than actually taking a name right off the page. For instance, I would use Moonlight in a name like ""Moonlight On My Shoes"". But it would be very hard to register a foal as just Moonlight in a large registry like AQHA. It is a good resource for barn names, nicknames, or arena names but I would not strongly reccomend it as a resource for coming up with a registration name."
3,better prices out there,great product. DOES NOT come with the carabiner in the picture. i think i paid $25 for this and we live in japan and when i went off base at the japanese mall i found the same product for around $7.00!
5,A small dissent,"Without being able to disagree with the 4 star review close by, I'll recommend this disk, especially at its price. It is excellent when you just want to read the Times to music - it will float behind any activity, or alternatively, justifies listening closely to hear the minor work of a master. Yablonskaya plays well and with impressive energy, the recording is good, and most of these pieces are outside anyone's direct experience in concert or recital."
4,Cabin in the Sky,A B/w Musical Classic.Excellent quality transfer of both Video and Sound.Good performances and reasonably good story line.Worth purchasing for Ethel Waters performance (singing and acting).
3,Amazing...,"Despite the sterotypes,it was still a good movie. Especially with one of my favorite singer/actress MISS.LENA HORNE.Beautiful,talented, and ageless until this day. I see why lead actress Ethel Waters, was jealous. She treated Lena bad behind the scenes because of her youth and beauty."
3,"Plodding and hokey, but, oh, that Lena!","In spite of some wonderful performances, you may be tempted to fast forward here and there, until you reach the climactic saloon sequence, where you get all the film's stars plus Duke Ellington and his orchestra and some lickety-split dancing that was achieved (it was 1943, thank you very much) with no digital enhancement. Until that sequence, though, there's too much folksy piety and too little Louis Armstrong (in his one scene he gets off a few hot licks before being interrupted by the creaky plot). The wonderful Ethel Waters is straightjacketed in a role that requires her to be oppressively sweet. The smiling must have exhausted her. But every time Lena Horne appears (which is not often enough) one is riveted. She has to act one crucial moment with just her feet in close-up, and even that she does brilliantly. You have to love a woman who can signal a major plot shift with one ankle."
1,cabin in the sky,"Cabin in the sky is a terrific movie. I really love it, however the quality sucks. The movie keeps getting stuck and it skips alot..I am totally disappointed in Amazon.com for sending me such poor merchandise. I will think twice before ordering from Amazon.com again!!"
2,product problem,I love the product but it will only play on my computer. I don't understand why it did not play on dvd player. The movie is excellent I purchase it for my library.
5,Reviews,I am enjoying these items. I love the selections. I have also purchased many of these items as gifts for friends.
4,Great and not late!,"This movie is truly a classic! Not only well written but the acting was good as well. The energy in this movie it truly like no other. I recommend it big time. Trust me, you will not be disappointed!"
1,BRILLIANT FILM Worst Commentary EVER!,"Why oh why did Warner ruin such a wonderful, amazing, joyous film by bringing in a commentary by the most nasty, negative, militant, killjoy African American scholar who with every word he uttered, turned the most innocent beautiful little scene from this lovely film into a ""statement of the white oppression of the black man"". While the makers of the film spoke of nothing but how it broke boundaries, this guy had to find something negative and disrespectful in EVER nuance. It was the most pathetic excuse for a ""statement"" since Warner had Whoopie Goldberg give a justifying commentary on 60 year old Warner and MGM cartoons. Disgraceful and insulting."
3,Disappointing African-American Musical,"African-American entertainers were offered so few opportunities to demonstrate their art to a ""mainstream"" audience in the 1940's that it's a shame that this film is such a lukewarm enterprise. The film dates badly suffering from a simplistic story that sometimes borders on racist stereotyping. The songs aren't particularly memorable and Lena Horne is essentially wasted in the role of temptress. I guess the selling point for me would be Ethel Waters charismatic turn as the righteous wife of the rascal Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson. Duke Ellington and his Orchestra also contribute a memorable bit. This film should be viewed more for it's historical importance than as lasting art."
1,unmemorable,I had to go back for my receipt to see if I had purchased this film. That sums it up for me.
5,A quality performance,"I bought this out of curiosity. Well, it won't exactly compare to Handel, but it is a quality opera, and it is very well presented here. I can't say that this is one of my favorite CD's, but it deserves a high rating. My usual idiosyncratic objection (which is NOT a reflection on the artistic merit!) is this: male roles should be sung by males. The world is teeming with countertenors ready to stand in the shoes of the unfortunate castrati for whom these operas were written."
5,The art of war and politics,"This books holds the second dimension of the 3 dimensional gem called ""The empires triology"". Leading you to view the desicions and lives of 3 leaders all engulfed in a sweeping war makes you think a bit about right and wrong, winner and loser. Almost as good as ""Horselords"" this book opens a gate to the land of Shou Lung, it's court and it's field. As a young general attemps to hold the kingdom's borders from the sweeping horde of Tuigan barbarians, while his wife attempts to save his reputation and command from the hands of spy sent to undermine him.A book that engulfs you in battles and conspirasies. A Must BUT can be fully enjoyed only after reading ""Horselords""."
5,A glimpse into the east...,"The 2nd book of the Empires Trilogy tells the story of the Tuigan invasion as seen by the Shou Lung General, Batu Min Ho. With fantastic depictions of both Shou Lung society and politics as well as insight into the tactical strategy of commanding armies numbering in the hundreds of thousands, this book is a treat. Mr. Denning is to be commended on his contribution to this excellent trilogy."
4,Nice,"I have not really had the chance to get in the book, a quick glance was very interesting. The details looked interesting and will compliment the video."
4,Drywall,I was very pleased with this book. It was complete and gave me some insights to sheet rocking that I had not heard before.
2,An OK book,"This book is OK for a beginner. In his book, the author advises using a setting-type joint compound. In addition, he does not use a banjo for setting his tape. ALMOST everyone else in the world uses a banjo or other mechanical device with all-purpose joint compound for embedding the first layer of tape. It works fine and is far, far less time consuming.This book is not as complete as others that are out there. There is a good deal about drywall installation and finishing that are not included."
2,Light Weight,"I was disappointed with this book. Being a general contractorfor the past 40 years, my knowledge exceeded this book's contents.I was looking for hand texture techniques, there was less than onepage on that and it did not describe any technique. This book is poor."
5,Covered everything I needed to know,"I decided to drywall over decorative block in our ski condo. All of my friends told me to avoid doing this myself, and to hire a professional. Long story short, I decided to do it myself. This book was a terrific step by step guide to the process. There are some techniques and tools he did not cover, specifically for making perfect butt joints, but other than that, I followed his advice to the letter and got great results. Highly recommend the book."
5,excellent book on everything about drywall,"This is an excellent book on drywall, if you want to do the work yourself. how to install it, finish it and texture it. this is a new version of a book that i had before. very good book"
3,A good guide for the beginner,"Having been a self-taught drywaller for 30+ years, but never having mastered the art, I was hoping for something more, but overall it covers the ground very well."
1,John Stovall,Be very careful when ordering the Lenmar Mach 1 chargers. There are two models and they don't have the same plates. This one doen't have the plates for charging the Canon BP511 battery. I had to return mine because of this. It would be very help full if there was a better listing of the batteries the plates fit.
4,Review of Mach 1 Alpha battery charger,the model ordered came with the necessary adaptor plates to handle the three different camcorder batteries our department uses. Very hand not to have to pull out the seperate chargers from each case.
2,"Hey Carl, lets get back to work please","The 1999 Edition was great for the first couple of years, but it is time for a new one now. This one is now antiquated. It's been 4 years now and we would like the 4th Edition ASAP. Let's go Carl and don't let the JV book take away all the light from the Varsity team's book !"
5,A truly great travel guide without LP's political agenda.,I strongly recommend this travel guide over several that I have read in the past. It covers everything (including beautiful Krabi area in depth) in a very scholarly and thoughtful view of this kind nation. The volume covers Thailand's fabulous extremes from misty blue mountains to the north to the pure tropical paradises of southern Thailand. The islands of the south are unrivaled by anything I have ever seen in the Caribbean! Mr Parkes tells it like is is without the tedious condescending environmental agenda that is the hallmark of the other leading guide. The information in here is easy to access and very up to date. I have used it exclusively in my recent SE Asia travels.
2,Weakest of the major independent travel guides to Thailand,"Of the major travel guides for independent travelers in Thailand, this is by far the weakest. Much of the information (accomodation, sites) was outdated by a couple years at release. The book's historical overview of Thailand is rather superficial and the country coverage is more spotty than its competitors. You're better off with the Lonely Planet Guide (which has slipped a bit in its last revision, but still a ""5 star"") and the Thailand installment in the ""Handbook"" series (also published as the ""Footprint Guides""), which also is a ""5 star""."
3,SURGEON,"This album is his weakest. Still good, but comparing to balance or basic***** or communications, it doesn't hold. Get it only if you are a collector."
4,Relentless and powerful!,I agree with Matt Mercer when he said that it isn't anything really new or exciting but the pure power and technical strength of the Surgeon's form on this release is breathtaking. It drills a hole straight into your noggin' and then some.
4,very good concert,"5 stars are ment for the very best in excelence.This concert I rate as 4 star which is very very good.With the right A/V sistem (DTS 5.1) it is a great adition to any collection.The concert is great, worth the investment.Sarah at her best, classic, pop-rock..............Her duo with Josh Groban is just great!!!!"
5,Beautiful...Stunning...Enchanting...AND MORE,"I can't even describe how much I love Sarah Brightman. Her music soothes the soul and warms the heart. This DVD takes some of her best works and brings them to the next level. Visually stunning and it sounds terrific.If you are a Sarah fan and you don't have this, SHAME ON YOU!!:)"
5,Sarah Brightman - a True Gift!,"First off, Sarah is not lip-syncing!!!! Every song on here is her singing live! ""La Lune""/""Winter In July"" shows it! She holds a word longer in ""Winter In July"" than on the album. She is singing live! ""He Doesn't See Me"" also shows it. Trust me, it is live! With the ""La Luna"" DVD, Sarah takes us on her journey to the moon and she doesn't disappoint! I got to see this live in Mass. and I loved it! I can't wait to see her next tour! Get this DVD! You will enjoy every minute!"
3,I agree with Tim Walsh!,"I completely agree with the review of Tim Walsh....the live concert was so incredible and I was sad to see so many great songs missing. Why didnt they edit this one the way they did One Night in Eden? Sarah Brightman is amazing and I agree that she deserves so much better. Let's hope for the DVD to be complete! The songs werent even in the same order as the concert. Sorry Sarah...you really got ripped on this one! I would say the video is worth purchasing if you love Sarah, but it's just a shame that people not fortunate enough to see the live concert will miss so much."
3,sarah brightman,"She has a beautiful voice, but this concert is a little out there. the music is amazing and i did enjoy it."
4,eat another score for Sarah,"The wait for DVD was well worth it! It turned out to be quite enjoyable. For those of us that don't have the priviledge of going to one of her concerts, this is almost as good.One complaint though - Phantom of the Opera suite is just not the same without Michael Crawford. Otherwise, its yet another score for Sarah."
4,Brightman Butchered,"I would really like to give this video five stars. I really would. But, eventhough I haven't seen the ""La Luna"" concert live, I can tell it was butchered in this video. ""One Night in Eden"" was beautifully done, and eventhough, I actually prefer the songs on this tape, I found the prior title much more enjoyable. You can tell nothing here is in sequence... it's all been sort of pasted together.Now, the settings are fantastic. Sarah Brightman is in excellent voice. The costumes are wonderful and have a mythic quality about them... think ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" or Ophelia from ""Hamlet"". It's all gorgeous but poorly edited to VHS.I'm still going to watch this one over and over again though just as I did with ""Eden""..."
3,Not Even Close!,I attended this concert in Atlanta and it was incredible. I was so disappointed in the quality of the video and the way several songs were left out. I still give it 3 stars since it is Sarah Brightman and my favorite artist. One song goes right into another. It's put together badly. I'm going to order the DVD version-I hear it's much better.
5,A Goddess in a DIVA!,"La Luna DVD for me is the start of a new GODDESS IN DIVA form, with respect to a talent that can switch back and forth from POP to Opera.Her vocal range is clearly one that very few have besides Charlotte Church. I love her Passion, Music, Persona, and most of all her Singing!Disciple for Real Music!"
5,La Luna,"What can I say about Sarah Brightman? Has she ever sang a bad song? She has a very soft speaking voice, but when she sings she can hit the highest of octaves and her smile can melt even the hardest of hearts."
5,American fan in Japan,"I have been a fan of Ms. Brightman since she was in Phantom of the Opera. As great as she was in that...... this DVD shows off how talented she is. When she sings Nessun Dorma, goose bumps cover my entire body. How long can she hold that last note (and perfectly!)? WOW. This will be a very welcome part of your DVD collection."
2,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE Sarah Brightman. However, I was sadly disappointed in the ""La Luna"" video.... the editing was extremely rough, like it was just thrown together, and the sound quality of the particular video that I received is all DISTORTED.....very poor sound quality....it sounds like my speakers are cracked! I think the ""Eden"" video wins hands down. Sarah's costumes and stage settings in ""La Luna"" are wonderful, magical, dreamlike, too bad it doesn't have the flow and well-put together qualities of ""Eden"". I'm going to send this video back and ask for another one, hopefully the sound quality will be better on another video?..."
2,Sound quality still causes production to suffer,"Seeing the concert live left me with much anticipation for the DVD; especially after reading poor reviews of the VHS release of the concert. Although the DVD is stunning visually, the sound quality brings much frustration to the viewing experience. Figlio Perduto and Pie Jesu were literally ruined due to the sound fading out almost as if a microphone wasn't plugged in all the way or the attenuation was on. Think of listeneing to a radio station that won't sty tuned in and that is the effect. There are also several points where the soundtrack seems to go from Dolby Digital to mono...at the worst times resulting in the drama of the piece being sacrificed. For such a strong artist, this production is an incredibly weak representation of Sarah Brightman's talent and Frank Peterson's skill."
2,La Luna,"This video is a great disappointment. The sound is very poor. The orchestra often drowns out most of the singing. The duet, I think it is ""Will you be there for me?"" was ruined by poor sound. The editing was awful, with sharp cuts from one song to another. One Night In Eden was incredibly good, and I have watched it over and over again. I will probably never watch La Luna again. I wish it could be re-released with the sound and editing fixed. I would not recommend wasting money on La Luna."
3,La Luna - La Loser,"I actually saw Sarah Brightman's La Luna concert in Chicago. While the concert was spectacular, other worldly, etheral, the video is an edited mess. Songs and costumes are presented out of order and at least 5 songs had been cut entirely. If you want one of Sarah's videos, I suggest One Night in Eden."
1,Don't waist your money,"Brightman lipsyncs the entire ""performance"". Any fool can tell. She also lipsyncs on the Eden concert DVD.If you want to see her actually sing live, purchase the ""Sarah Brightman In Concert"" DVD.Trust me!"
5,Five Star Paerformance,The otherworldy scenario and a flawless Sarah Brightman takes one on a surreal journey. Few concerts can offer the escapism a Sarah Brightman concert does.This is a must have for those get away moments. There is great bonus footage and I recommend this disc to fans and those that might want to find out what a great performer Ms. Brightman is.
2,"Get the DVD, but DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO","First off, I LOVE Sarah Brightman. The concert was SUPERB (and worth travelling to see), and the CD is awesome. BUT! This VHS is HORRIBLE! It's not even 60 minutes long for $24.99!!! Way too many songs were cut from the actual concert, and I could have edited this performance better with scotch tape. They may call Streisand a control freak, but Sarah Brightman should have been overseeing the editing of this video. Given the top notch quality of her performances, it's difficult to believe that this video would have gained her approval."
5,The best concert of all time,"Sarah Brightmans has the most buetifull voice. She is extremely talented, no other artists out there have a deep imagination and creativity to their show like her. I saw her in the La luna concert and was amazed and all other 15 thousand people my parents and brothers were all influenced by it and so were the people who all were captivated. Sarah didn't give the Audience a momment to relax it was all fast and buetiful and each song offered a different setting and Imagary. I loved the concert so much that I had to have it on DVD. This is deffinetly one you have to own. It shows you highlights or the show."
4,Is it a Question of Honor?,"I went to this concert in Virginia... and I liked both... I don't know what to tell you. Cuz this movie was not what I had been hoping it to be. I liked the song ""It's a Question of Honor"" But ohhh well. I think Sarah Brightman has the best voice... and dose the best duet..with Andrea Bochelli."
1,"Oh, my ... Lip-synced again?","Thank you previous reviewer (Tom) for the warning of her lip-syncing in this dvd. I totally agree that she lip-synced in ""One Night in Eden"", which lacked her passion and spirit and communication between her and audience because of ""not"" actually singing. So, I know that in any case audience cannot be led to Eden even for one munite without singers' actual singing and sincere effort. I almost wanted to try this dvd expecting a real concert. I won't buy this because of the reviewer's ""testimony"". I'd like comment this: If a singer can't sing before audience, she/he must quit singing with humble heart."
2,It's not DnB!,"Be forewarned: this CD is NOT Panacea's typical drum n bass style music. It's more like experimental dark electronica with Panacea at the decks looping samples realtime while vocalist from Japan, Hanayo, does her own thing. The keyword here is experimental--some of the tracks were amuzing to listen to though. The CD cover art and layout inside looks pretty cool but the music just didnt appeal to me."
4,Of Swedish Ways,It was a gift for a family member interested in his heritage. I'm glad that it was still available.
4,I like these books,"I'm still looking through this book but I mainly like the styles to play with. (I didn't have to pay for this book, it was given to me but I don't normally buy these ""instant effects"" things....I have to know how an effect is created and why)In my opinion, this is a ""fun"" type of book to have especially if you want to get right to doing fun/cool things without having to do any hardcore thinking...it's for those who don't really need to know ""how""...just that they ""can"".It's fun =)"
3,Esoteric yet helpful,"My therapist recommended this book. I've been searching for information on the goddess Hetaira (she gets in the middle of people) and Nor Hall didn't disappoint. Though it reads like a doctoral thesis, it is well researched and fairly accessible."
5,An Interesting Look at Romantic Writers,I bought this book after renewing it three times from the library. It is an amazing way to look at the standard (or not-so-standard because he includes Jane Austin) Romantic writers. It really breathes new life into works that many thought nothing else could be written on. I admit that I love trauma and cognitive theories so I'm thrilled that this is available in an affordable paperback version. I have recommended it to more people than I can count and made it a prominent feature on my reading list.
1,Awful scan job,"Great book, but the scan on the kindle version looks like it was done on sheets taken from a broken mid-90's photocopier. Buy the print version."
2,Why would one pay more for a Kindle Copy?,"I would expect to see fairness in pricing of Kindle Books as opposed to hard or paper bound copies of the same book. But on 12 Jul 2010, here was the price structure for each edition of the book:Hardcover ....... $44.30Kindle Edition .. $57.60Paperback ....... $111.25URL: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000URVA0M/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleWho is kidding who?"
2,Big problems with Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition has numerous problems with the mathematics in this book. Equations are small and fuzzy when expanded, almost to the point of unreadability. In many cases, e.g. Maxwells's Equations the nabla symbol is missing, this is also the case in the text, making the whole exercise deeply frustrating to read. This is a good text for the mathematical nuts and bolts of the Standard Model, but is pretty much a waste of money in Kindle format."
2,not sure this is the best copy,Anyone entertaining purchasing this disc might research the Elvira version instead. This disc is obviously from a VHS master and has a few awkward edits making it pg-13.
3,"Some neat pieces but Rumi, Hafiz etc. are much more powerful in every way","I was disappointed given all the rave reviews so far for all of Adyashanti's books. Although there were some neat pieces and insights, I find infinitely more power and depth in the writings of other enlightened beings including such well known ones as Rumi, Hafiz, Kabir, Mira Bai, Yunus Emre (""The Drop that Became the Sea"") or ""Nobody Son of Nobody"" by Shaikh Abu-Saeed Abil-Kheir. Of course it might be a matter of personality or approach better suited to some than others. That is why I'm listing some of the others I find much more powerful so as to give you a hopefully helpful baseline of comparison for your purchasing decision as I personally find those other authors deliver everything mentioned by the 4/14/05 reviewer much more powerfully."
4,Timeless Sense,"Regardless of the site, habitat, style and century of implementation, Page's comments and thoughts on good landscape design will remain true.Oh, and it's a good read!"
2,"Ehh, okay, not what I expected","I bought this because it was recommended by another landscape designer as one of the best books on cultivating oneself as a landscape designer.I found the book a bit dull...the author drones on and on about his opinions on what makes a garden great, or what makes other gardens not so great. Part of the problem is that he is describing lots of visual concepts with words, yet fails to provide the illustrations that would more succinctly make his point. The photos that he does include, showing ""spectacular gardens"" are in black and white - which fails to show the reader the beauty he describes.I tried reading it from the front. Tried various chapters, but haven't been able to really get into it."
1,Red River,"Dear Sirs;I received this dvd for the wrong region, It wouldn't play for that reason, so I returned it. That's the last I saw it and haven't heard from the seller. Can you help. Ridiculous! Red River with John Wayne."
5,birth of capitalism,"In today's times of worry, this film can be seen from many points of view: one is a superb western, and B&W phtography drmatizes that all. But also there's Dunson, the beginner or the man of big ideas and projects (the lands were property of ""El Rey de las Españas"" as says the Mexican gunman to the service of D. Diego. Dunson kills the Mexican and here he's very capable yet until some more time.But after this he's surpassed and his brutality end energy is no more necessary and an error so he falls in a sort of psychopatology. These are the time not of the founders, but of the ""managers"", in this case personified in Montgomery Clift which knows what to do not only with the cattle but with the railway, the money and summing up, managing a business, the abilities that Dunson lacks."
5,A great western,"I love Red River. It is another classic John Wayne western, with excellent acting, wonderful story, and great scenery. Montgomery Clift was superb, as well as John Wayne, Joanne Dru, and Walter Brennan. An excellent western."
4,One of John Wayne's better roles,"Red River was released in 1948 and directed by Howard Hawks. I used to think someone did a poor job of casting women in these Hawk/Wayne films, but after re-watching this film recently, I now believe that the scriptwriters for these movies just didn't know how to write realistic dialogue for women. It wasn't how they said their lines, it was that their lines were inane. Too bad. It's the only flaw in this otherwise classic western.At the beginning of this century, Red River enjoyed a mini-revival after City-Slickers mentioned the film and then reenacted the iconic yelping kickoff of the cattle drive. Great fun to watch them together, but start with Red River. It really explains the motivation for the characters in City Slickers."
1,Bad Disk,"The disk was bad or damaged upon opening. Will not work in any DVD player gets a ""regional error"". Disappointing."
5,We loved it,It was another great John Wayne movie with an interesting twist to it. We would recommend it to any JW fan
2,Billed as a psycological western. I don't particularly care for movies in which,"John Wayne plays an ass----. Maybe it just gives his typical character too many facets. He is Tom a cattle rancher who adopts as his own Matt played later as the boy grown up by Montgomery Clift. Tom becomes a ruthless cattle baron. Matt is starting to chafe under Tom's heavy handed control. He wants his own herd & own brand. Tom won't hear of it. Conflict ensues & it gets ugly.I haven't read all 80 something reviews, but somewhere it might have been mentioned that this was John Kennedy's favorite movie. Interesting in that in his own real life he had a love-hate relationship with his own father, Joe sr. His father was rather domineering, desiring to control every aspect of JFK's life, & the future president hated it. So similar to the characters on the screen"
3,Red River,"Acting/directing not as good as expected, but still a must see for any serious western fan."
5,John Wayne Fan,I purchased this as a gift for my dad he's a big John Wayne fan. It was received in a timely manner and there were no scratches on the disk. Thanks
3,Not bad but not that great for 80 bucks,Sound pretty decent. My old JVC boombox generate much better bass than this but it doesn't support MP3. Everything else is standard for a small boombox.
2,Sony went the cheap route,"I don't know why, but Sony stuck it to the customer with this one. I received this as a gift for Christmas but I'm taking it back.""Why?"", you ask.1. Because for eighty bucks it looks cheap. It is not well represented by the picture here on Amazon. The black plastic exterior has a shiny finish, not dull as it appears in the picture. A shiny finish looks terrible with a few scratches in it and thumbprints stick out.2. It includes a line-in jack(which is great) for connecting an Ipod or other MP3 player to it, but it DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CABLE! I had to cannibalize the cable from my PC. What do these things cost? A quarter?3. It doesn't include batteries for the remote. For you young'uns(and I'm not that old), it used to be that including batteries for such a thing were standard, especially from a good company like Sony.To sum it up: If they had spent a few more pennies on things that should have come with this player, I would have been happy."
5,Beautiful voice and music,Anyone who loves eastern chant and the voice of Sr. Keyrouz will appreciate this CD. This music is modern and is perhaps more accessible than this artists recordings of chant but it evokes the same sounds and influences of early eastern music.
5,A book of many Special Stories.,This is a book of many Special Stories. So well written you feel you were there. It is one of those books you cannot stop reading till you finish that last Story.
3,A Walk down Memory Lane,An easy read and interesting. Probably of more interest to those living in that particular time and place.A little repetitive but still a good light reading experience.
3,*sigh*,"What can I say? Meh. Nothing too spectacular going on here. I was a little disappointed. This later sound is a little too commercial for me. You'd be better off buying ""Crocodiles"" if you want the early, good stuff."
5,Completely Satisfied,"This phone is light, full-featured, takes great pictures, and plays nice with my Parrot Bluetooth kit (CK-3000 Evolution). I was hesitant to buy a phone with smudge-prone surfaces, but the all-black metal-and-glass finish looks great and is holding up well. Love the flexibility of the USB connection, although I wish the charger had its own plug. Highly recommended!"
1,battery lasts 8-10 hours,I am now going to be on my 4th phone today because the first defective ones touchpad didnt work and the next two phones wont hold a charge more than 8-10 hours. the up side is the camera works nice. my e-815 was over two years old and working fine until verizon kept calling me every day bouuing me to upgrade(what a mistake).make sure if you decide to go this route that there arent long lines at your local store because you will be going back many times.
1,bad pictures and videos,"pictures and videos are not clear, all muddly.verizon locked several options to share pictures songs and ringtones thru bluetoodwith mono bluetood you can not heard your music."
3,ISBN CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO A DIFFT (2010) BOOK,"9781121510838 is now being used by McGraw Hill publishing for it's Real Estate Principles - A Value Approach by Ling/Archer (2010). Don't know why the complete ISBN 10 AND ISBN 13 numbers for this architecture book (1960) is thoroughly reassigned to the Real Estate book, but just a forewarning to students who are trying to find the former."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rucker's Robotos, or bops, have decided to go in for a bit of hybridisation, so they create organic clone bodies for themselves from human DNA.Quite a bit of silliness in these books, robot moon bases and other explorations notwithstanding, it is a bit of a look at how weird sentient machines or AI could get."
2,Interweave Press-Exploring Resin Jewelry-Making DVD,"Sorry, I couldn't get past hearing all the ""uhms"", ""ers"" and ""sos"" to actually concentrate on what she was saying. If that doesn't bother you, I'm sure it's very informative."
2,Marine land replacement lamp for aquarium,Not what I needed at all. Eclipse has discontinued the Eclipse 3 - still looking for an an option as my lamp has failed
5,A UKULELE CORNUCOPIA!!!,"This CD has it all. Classic ukulele of EDDIE KAMAE, JESSE KALIMA, HERB OHTA SR (OHTA-SAN)and KIMO HUSSEY. Jazz ukesters LYLE RITZ and BILL TAPIA. Wunderkind, JAKE SHIMABUKURO. Champion of the uke revival, JIM BELOFF and some of the finest contemporary ukulele masters playing today. A nice variety of music also, traditional Hawaiian, popular, jazz, patriotic and classical. 22 mind-boggling tracks of great ukulele music. Every uke lover should have this recording!"
3,Way overrated,"Having read some great reviews for this book on Amazon, I went to the library to check the book out and was rather disappointed. The book is OK, but nothing to rave about. It uses rather archaic probabilistic language, not very precise in the statements and sometimes plainly boring. Moreover a good half of it contains a less than perfect intro to probability. All in all, not a bad book, but probably not worth buying."
5,Statistics at a glance,"Principles of statistics is not a new book (1967). Therefore, it include a modern approach if compared with that era. Actually, the major advantage in read this publication will be found in its simply structure. A student in physiotherapy or in nursing science or people who are interested in statistic should be recognize a lot of useful information after reading. This book could be the best way to learn the basic of statistic especially for the health professions. Also the ratio price/quality is really good. Student, after reading, they should be able to make inferential in their data set and finally understand this particular matter often not really simple."
2,Not For The Beginner,"This book is too technical and has too much math. A better book for the elementary learner is ""Practical Statistics: Simply Explained,"" by Russell Langley. Bulmer's book may be useful to me later on after I understand basic statistics. But don't waste your money if you know little about statistics and you don't like complex mathematical explanations."
2,Reads like a textbook and is just as vague,"I am a very math oriented person. I like formulas to be laid out in front of me and I love looking at the steps that it took to solve a problem. What I always hated about textbooks is that they would skip steps throughout a problem. Once you're lost, you stay lost. I took some very high level statistic courses in college, was always kind of lost, and thought I would go through it again with hopefully a better book than what we had.This book is even worse. Formulas are mentioned mid-paragraph and are not laid out in an ""orderly"" manner. There are no steps shown to how referenced example problem solutions were achieved. A formula will be mentioned, an example table will be displayed, a question will be posed, and the final answer is shown. This book is for those who already have a solid foundation. New comers stay away!"
2,Not much of a help,"I started reading this book and the first parts made sense, then I got lost. It might be a good book for a refresher or a review, or maybe I am just a visual learner."
4,Bigfoot Expert Offers New Ideas,"I just got this audio tape yesterday and while I've never been a ""no kill"" advocate, Robert Morgan opened my mind to new ideas about the Bigfoot phenomena. The tape really is an adventure, taking you into the bush with Morgan as he and a friend track and find a group of elusive mountain giants. Robert provides details for seeking the creatures and for staying alive in the woods. He is very much against violence towards these creatures and he draws on his experiences with Native American tribes to help in his search. Overall, I would reccomend this tape for anyone interested in Bigfoot."
3,Duey's Tale Book,Received the product quickly and product was in good condition. The recipient of this gift was very pleased!
2,Rent or borrow it - don't buy it!,"The L&L Childbirth video was chock-full of info. This was not. I watched the entire thing in less than 40 minutes! A very few useful tips, but overall, not worth the time at all. I would recommend you rent it or borrow it, but this was definitely not worth buying."
5,Just what I needed,This video is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is very thorough and informative. I am going to watch it a couple of times before the baby comes. It's not too long and held my interest by not dragging out steps. It has definitely given me a much betterconfidence about my knowledge of breast feeding.
3,"I think it was good, but you probably dont need this.","I thought the info was good and I enjoyed watching it. It helped me feel prepared, but really I learned everything I needed from the lactation consultant at the hospital... so if you have access to a lactation consultant, save your money."
4,Good Basic Information,"My wife and I watched this together after watching Laugh and Learn about Childbirth, which was really good. It gives a good baseline knowledge about Breastfeeding, but the lactation counselor at the hospital was awesome!! I would recommend this to new parents, even Dads who want to help out your wives, but don't expect this to be your only source of information and help on the subject. My wife was able to put what she learned in the video right to use after the baby was born. Sheri Bayles keeps the topic interesting in all her videos. Although some of her time lines that she gives in the video seemed a little overwhelming when you see how often you have to feed a newborn and such but it really hasn't been that bad so far."
1,Bad Advice,"I checked this video out at the library and I'm so glad I didn't spend money on it. Where are the babies? She uses dolls, which doesn't give you a good picture of how breastfeeding actually works. I'm also glad I didn't check this out before I had been successfully breastfeeding for a couple of months, because I disagreed with the advice. Stop feeding your baby after 10-15 minutes a side? My baby is a slow eater. Why would I deprive him of food? And what's the problem with allowing him some non-nutritive sucking after he's done eating? Breastfeeding is about more than just calories. You have to meet their emotional needs too. The worst part? I didn't laugh. Just not funny."
2,too much laugh - less learned!,"When you buy this DVD, chances are that you are pregnant ... so: show me how this is done properly! I would have liked more hands-on. The theory is easy to follow, but this is not helping you in the real world. I would have also liked to hear about potential problems that you could face."
5,informative and fun,"I was really nervous about the prospect of breastfeeding. Many of my friends were so frustrated that they gave up after a few weeks! I watched this video before I gave birth and again when I got home from the hospital. Within days my baby girl and I were in perfect harmony. It answered all my questions with humor and in terms I could understand. The demonstrations are great. They actually got a new mom to breastfeed on the camera and the close ups were really helpful, as well as all the different ""holds"". My husband watched it with me and was laughing too. Since then, I've bought it as a gift for two of my girlfriends and they loved it. Highly recommended!"
2,Not many laughs and only limited learning,"This video was informative enough, but it's brief, and really doesn't have anything I haven't seen on You Tube or other free sources. I was a little wary about the humor since the title is 'Learn and Laugh About Breastfeeding' after all, but Sheri Bayles is simply not funny, and at points it's painful to watch. She's clearly working hard to sell her schtick, but the purpose of the video is to get info on breastfeeding, not to allow an outlet for an obviously frustrated comedienne. She knows breastfeeding facts, and she'd do better to just give the information. Finally, it'd be a better video if they included more footage of real babies feeding, latching, etc., rather than focusing on the baby dolls and Sheri's endless banter from the couch."
2,One major complaint,"I reviewed this DVD in the hope of showing it to young mothers in a mentoring program. The instructor is obviously an expert and is very knowledgeable on the subject, however, 5 minutes into the video she uses the Lord's name in vain. She is referencing the pain you feel when the baby first latches on. The pain is real, but she says ""Oh my G-d"" to describe it. She also tells her audience not to drink a 1/5 of vodka if you want to co-sleep with your baby. I believe she was saying this in jest, but her crudeness made this video inappropriate to use with young mothers. It is a shame because I think she knows her subject well. I wish the editors of this video would have clued her in on the fact that what she said might offend."
1,What The Heck,"This is along with ""Frankenstein Created Woman"" one the worst ones in the series. Baron Frankenstein was toooo off character in this one mean and cold hearted he wasn't like this in ""Created Woman"" or ""Evil"" and what was the Rape Scene for what does that have to do with his Experiments also a big goof in ""Created Woman"" his hands were Severealy Scarred From his Castle Catching on fire in ""Evil of Frankenstein"" yet here his hands look perfectly fine duhhh scars like that don't heal"
2,I have nothing but respect for Terence Fisher...however,"this film is absolutley BORING. I appreciate that Fisher was trying to do something different(considering this was the 5th Hammer/Frankenstein film) and I agree with a previous reviewer that this film is ultimately a drama(not a horror film) but, as I said, it is just flat out boring."
2,Frankensten Must Be Destroyed: Less Than Brillant,"TO: Hammer Film FansThe Good:The Film is dramatic, with an ok plot.The Bad:I got this film before it was re-rated. It was rated PG! The Vampire Lovers was PG. Scars of dracula was R. Hammer has rating problems. besides that the monster looks dumb.FROM: The Hammer Film Reveiwer (SEE MY OTHER REVEIWS!)"
5,One of my top 3 for 1997!,"This is a wonderful first novel which is chock full of story(s), and great characters you really root for. There is something for everyone here from S/M to AA to Alzheimers, child abuse, drugs, motorcycle gangs, car chases, guns, a non-hokey romance,and even pets adopted from an animal shelter! Seranella's narrative flow keeps it all in the air and moving. She makes the whole thing almost believable, and she caught me with a nifty surprise ending. Despair is everywhere, but so is hope, and the reader is lead to believe these wonderful characters are headed for redemption. This is one of the top three books I've read this year, and I recommend it highly. P.S. It even has narrow margins!!!"
4,"very,very good+","this product is great and works very well. printing is sherp and clear, since it is remanufactured, it means very little. it works just like it is new."
3,great for 1 year then done,"I've been using the printer as a home printer meaning it was never used hardand was very happy. It's a little over a year old now and time to replace, it startsto print then all the lights in my office dim way down and it dies. The red paperlight flashes but I have plenty of paper, if I reset it sometimes it'll run but mostof the time it won't run until it cools down for an hour. Guess I'll look at otherbrands because I don't trust this unit is made to last."
1,Not as tough as I would like,I bought one of these 2 years ago for my home and it worked very well for me....still does but is now starting to do the gear clicking thing another reviewer described. I bought another one 4 months ago to use as an invoice printer b/c of the speed and economy. After about 600 invoices it began the red light paper jam thing and is now virtually unusable...and beyond the return window. Sticking with HP from now on...
4,More than expected,"Having bought several other Shih Tzu books, I didn't have great expectations of this one. I was wrong. This book provided information without ""selling"" useful products. Information on picky eaters, whelping and training was very useful."
4,"Good, but limited","The book is short, so there isn't as much info in it as other Shih Tzu books I own. However, it still has some info that I haven't read elsewhere."
4,Great book,"My Shih Tzu recently had puppies so I bought a bunch of these books to give to the new owners of them and I think its great for an owner and a new Shih Tzu owner as well, its easy reading and straight to the point."
4,lyrical knowledge,Todd Baron is a modernist poet who utilizes language and the lyric to actually say something BOTH about teh world and language itself. Is language knoweldge. WHo cares? THe beauty of these poems lies in their musical exploration of the poem and thought. (they're also unusally sexy...hmmm. )
1,it over charge me,It was suppose 2 be 59.95 but went up price and charged me loads of money if anyone buys this crap goes 2 6 different countrys just get country uk does nt work
1,Not worth the material it's made in!,"I bought this iron for my mom since I thought it would be better for her back. But it's so heavy that she has to put extra effort just to lift it onto the fabric. Not only that, the soleplate has a cheap coating on it that scratches just by going over a zipper!"
1,THIS IS GARBAGE,"DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL SET!!!!!!! When I open the case for the first time about half of the tools fell out. The case holds nothing in place. You can put everything where it goes but as soon as you lift it to carry it somewhere you can here everything fall out of its place. Also the hex keys are on a keyring type of holder that doesn't hold them at all. The tools themselves are ok for the price but every other aspect of this set is totally asinine. This was to be a gift for my nephew, a first tool set kind of thing, no way now."
4,perfect for car,my car was stolen and my orginally tool set was gone when got car back. this is the closest thing to the old set i had. it works perfect for the trunk of the car.
3,Not the greatest tools or case.,"The tools pretty much work, but I would not get them for regular use tools. They are great for the car. Be careful when you open it since the case doesn't hold the tools well."
3,Not so good for price,Bad quality case. Tools are of so so quality. Most of them will fall down as case can not hold them. I did not find it much useful.
5,Plain english,"This book is amazing. I was struggling to come to grips with Judith Butler (and Foucault). I tried to understand what Butler had written and found it too dense. I tried to read those who had interpreted her and found them even worse. Then I read Media, Gender, and Identity and the sections on Butler and Foucault (written in plain English). There followed a period of 'enlightenment'."
4,Very Good,I had to order this book for school and decided to order online because the price was much cheaper than that at the bookstore. I got supersaver shipping (which helped a lot) and I got my book before classes started.
3,Easy Speedy Portuguese,"I find this to be a pretty good course in general, for an audio only programme. However, it is primarily Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation, so for people like me, wanting to learn Continental Portuguese, it is not quite as helpful. But still, it is a good resource."
1,Pretty bogus merchandise,"I ordered what was described as a Fishman stereo cable with a straight 1/4"" plug at one end and a right-angle one on the other, which is what the picture shows. What arrived was a ZipLoc bag containing a cable with a straight stereo plug on each end -- unusable for my application.The cable read Belden, and the connectors Neutrik. Makes me suspect that the cable was Fishman (a very reputable company), or even that it was definitely new. Refund time."
3,Flawed Package,"After returning from a tour of Budapest last summer I returned eager to pick up the story of other diplomats, besides Wallenberg, and others involved in the rescue of jews during the Holocaust. Wallenberg seems to get the most attention probably due to his tragic end but we must remember all who acted in face of great danger. People such as Anger, Lutz, Perlasca and other who were denied proper tribute in the period immediately following the war. My problem with this book is that it lacks notes and an index. Tschuy's account of Lutz published in German may include the needed footnotes but you will not find them here. Readers looking for a documented account should look elsewhere."
4,Wer hat zuerst gerochen....,"As a freshman effort, this is ausgezeichnet! Wie 'ne Deutsche DEVO, die durch ein Food Processor geschwummen hat, only to be devoured by NKOTB-T-Shirt-wearing sharks at the tide-line. Frantic und anxiety-ridden, pfurzvoll und ubergegeben, alle trenden sind im digital-essig ge-soaking, fermenting into a choppity micro-train wreck... Worth it if only for the unbeatable ""Party Ganze Nacht."""
1,Buyer Beware,Potential buyers should be aware that these are REPRINTS. There is not even one Mantle card that would sell for this amount of money. Forget 10 in mint condition.Do not waste your money!The seller is being incredibly disingenuous by offering these cards without noting that they are REPRINTS.
1,Item description is WRONG!!!,"If you are searching for a battery for your laptop, you find this. Yes, the title says it is a AC adapter, but everything else says it is the battery. Well, what you get is the adapter. Highly misleading!!!"
4,Teaches you about the horse and how to manage a horse.,"This book is great for learning about the body systems of a horse.It also briefly explains how to manage a stable with things such as how to make a stall have good drinage. It is the best book to get if you want to meet the requirements of Pony Club levels A, HA, or B. But I recommend getting this book only if you are at the advanced levels in riding and horsemanship because otherwise you will find that the book overwhelms you with information.I may suggest that people buying this book should consider buying Pony Club Manuals on levels C and D before or perhaps in addition to this manual.Overall, a good book for learning about the horse."
4,A book with a lot of info.,This book is very informitave and helped me alot. I am only a D-2 but it still answered alot of the questions I had. It covers everything from teaching horsemanship to jumping and yes even vet care. The jumping part helped me to understand alot of things that helped me train my horse. I recomend that you buy it.
2,copyright 1994,"This book has a copyright of 1994. I applied for the test, and when I recieved the information packet, the descriptions of the test were significantly different. I am going to buy a more current edition."
1,not very helpful,"I don't usually do reviews, but I was so disappointed in this book that I want to warn others. I bought this book to study for the rural carrier exam. I was mostly interested in learning some strategies for taking the memory portion of the exam. I wasn't happy with this book's method of assigning random letters to numbers and then trying to make words and stories out of them. The book didn't mention easy ways to break down the numbers, or maybe focusing on just names or numbers first, or even talk about whether you're penalized for wrong guesses or not. The chapters on studying for other portions of the test don't measure up, either. For example, the number sequence study section uses multiplication and division and the real test does not. It's a waste of time to learn how to decode number sequences that aren't even on the postal exam.I definitely do not recommend this book. You'd be better off just using what the post office sends you and winging the rest."
2,TOO BASIC - NOT ENOUGH DETAIL,"I thought from the advertisement & description that this map would include road details that would allow me to use it as my source for traveling around the island of Nassau. NOT SO! There are only very basic roads shown and not nearly enough detail. Additionally, this is only a map, NOT a book! AMAZON charges you book rate to ship, which means you are going to pay approximately 4 times the actual cost for shipping! I am a regular shopper here and am typically satisfied, but NOT this time!"
4,Best of the Bahamas maps,Big Laminated detailed map. I used it mountain biking all across Grand Bahama and Abaco.Folded nice in my bike shorts and lasted a full week of in and out of pockets wet and dry.
1,poor purchase,"This knife looks and feels CHEAP. The handle is plastic (excuse me Zytal) and the spot where the plastic (er, Zytel) was joined at the factory wasn't even smoothed off. The blade (though it is stamped surgical steel) is boldly also stamped ""CHINA"" Nuff said! Oh, and if you decide you don't like your cheap feeling/looking knife the company will NOT take it back! I know because I'm stuck with one."
3,Children's Book,"This book is about 15 pages long, and has perhaps 100 total words in it. It's a great little primer for kids who have no idea about early languages, but I wish I had taken 25 seconds to read the categories on this page before buying it. I also wish there was a picture of it!"
2,only for the die-hard,"Anyone looking for a ""Spike Jones"" treatment will be sorely dissapointed. Rather than using his usual comical approach and crew, we are ""treated"" to a banal ""25 voice choir"" and the City Slicker Juniors (7 of spike's nieces and nephews). More recognizeable is George Rock on ""two front teeth"" and a few other tunes. A rather bland '50s holiday fare worth a listen at best. Think of the soundtrack for the burning log of tv years past. This '88 release was reissued in '98 as ""Let's sing a song of Christmas"" and is a better deal available for listening and purchase at Amazon.Let's Sing a Song of Christmas"
3,Beginning Bluegrass Banjo; Pete Wernick,"I found the Pete Wernick DVD helpful but the Tablature that is included has errors in it. In addition, the tab notes are shown in the spaces of the staff instead of on the strings, making it very confusing to decipher where to place fingers. The tab would have been much more helpful if it had been written in such a way that each note had a tail on it and and they were connected to give an indication of the rhythm so that when using the written reference without the DVD, the student would have a rhythm guide to go by.This is definitely written for the banjo player who has no sense of melody and no introduction to chord construction. I found it too basic after playing guitar for years, even though I am just starting on the banjo. If the Tabulature was improved, I could rank this DVD higher.Nancy"
4,Good beginner DVD,"I previously took lessons, so am a little above a beginner (nor much, though) - this DVD starts out at the basics and moves on from there. A good way to learn basic banjo playing...and a lot cheaper than taking lessons."
1,Safety Hazard,I purchased this swing for my daughter and found she always managed to slide to one side with her head sticking out between the bars on the side. She was of average weight and size at the time and adjusting the belt did not correct the problem. This swing is unsafe to use because of the design.
3,Great Beginner Book,"This is one of the much needed board books their so durable and this story is so cute with a really good lesson for boys or girls. I add my own little extra noises to make it more interesting like some ""choo choos"" and ""ribbit ribbits"" when theres the bright green toad it makes it all the more fun and as far as board books go this is great cause its a full little story not just 3 words per page. Go Thomas Go!"
3,"Dumb story, nice pictures","My son loves Thomas and we got this travel-sized board book for our latest flight. The story is pretty annoying, though... is it supposed to rhyme or not? Why doesn't the bus driver go around the dumb toad? Since when did Thomas think there was nothing a train couldn't do? And seriously, what's up with the weather? Get it for the pictures and make up your own story to go along."
2,No point,"I have to agree with the other 2 star review. It drives me nuts that they go out of their way to rhyme in some parts in the book, but not others. This book just feels disjointed, and the story line is not very good."
5,Great Board Book,I love this book. The story line is great for my 3yr old and the pics are great for my 4mo old. It's easy to pack in the diaper bag for either of my kids entertainment. I received it sooner than expected so that was a pleasant surprise.
3,"Yummy, but repetitive!","If you can only own one Maida Heatter, then Great American Desserts would be a marvelous choice - five stars even. However, if you are like me and happen to have several of Maida's books, you will find this book repetitive in the extreme. I was so disappointed when I found that every single recipe in three full chapters came word for word from herPies & Tarts (Maida Heatter Classic Library)book. Don't say you weren't warned."
4,"Hypnotic, but a little weaker than ""Fortunes of War""","A good set of sequels to the Balkan trilogy; in some ways superior (the war narrative) and in others a bit of a letdown (the random encounters of Harriet get a little hard to stomach). Much more coarse than the first books, particularly in a gratuitous and unnecessarily graphic sex scene, but the characters are well-drawn"
3,Entertaining,This is an illuminating look at life in wartime in Egypt and the Middle East. It concerns British non-combatants who have somewhat of a soap opera relationship and there is another story line about a young soldier involved in desert warfare. I enjoyed reading about WW II in a different place than the usual.
1,Coffee maker just died,"This coffeemaker is only a couple months old, and we need to throw it away because it mostly steams when we try to brew coffee. We've already had to clean it with vinegar several times, and it reclogs quickly. We've even been using filtered water. It is the messiest coffeemaker we've ever had because the grounds spatter all over the coffeemaker when brewing. It is a horrible design which is a shame. Using this coffeemaker over the last few months has been a HASSLE!!"
5,Best coffeemaker I have ever owned!,"I bought this in Dec. 08, so I've been using it for almost a year and a half. No problems whatsoever. It makes great coffee. (I grind whole beans very fine.) It is reliable, easy to program and easy to clean. The programmable warming plate feature has turned out to be very useful and I thought I'd never use it. Get the gold filter, it vastly improves the taste as well as saves trees. I am very impressed with this machine and will make it a point to buy Cuisinart products in the future!"
4,A great album!,"ok, there's seem to be some confusion here.. This man is NOT DMX the rapper. He's ""DMX Krew"" the electroman from UK. This CD is off the chain, he has some truly wicked tracks. Just check out ""Mouse"", ""A Place Called Love"", ""Can U Feel The Power"" and ""I'm All Alone (Cylob Mixx). I had the opportunity to see him live, and I can tell you; It was the greatest concert I ever been too. RAW HARDCORE ELECTRO WITH AN OLDSCHOOL TWIST. I suggest everyone who enjoys the oldschool sound to check out his albums, one little confusing thing about the album is that all the songs appears twice. It's just too bad his albums and 12inches are so hard to get. When he comes back to Sweden, I will surely go to see him perform again. Also listen to: Cylob, Bassjunkie, ComputorRockers."
5,Extremely Helpful,Pete is such a natural teacher. Gained much insight on practicing and how to practice in an organized fashion. Looking forward to using Wonderful World of Chords next.
4,Good product with good fit,I was happy with this product. The fit was exactly what I expected. Washes well and doesn't seem to fade or deteriate with use. I am glad I bought them for my kids
4,remodeler,These are very pretty and look great in my remodeled bathroom. My only complaint is that there is one little imperfection in the finish along the edge.
4,Bad cover .. but,Great songs.. Full rich .. abit noisy at times but refreshing sounds even till today.Surely not sleep elevator music... my favourite track MOVE OVER DARLING
4,"The ""least important"" Bach? another missleading definition!","Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (the least famous son of Johann Sebastian) should be better known. In this CD three (from the five) works are from the 1780-s, and their style is close to the world of Haydn and Mozart. One of these works is the beautiful cello sonata from 1789, in which the cello and the pianoforte are perfectly mixed in a memorable performance. The other works are also of high quality. A very enjoyable CD."
1,couldnt get it to work,i checked the system requirements like another reveiwer recomended and it said it would work for windows vista which is what we have and it did not my kids were very disappointed they couldnt play it so i dont know what the game is like so it may be great just dont get it if you have vista!
3,Human nature,"I have to agree with anyone who has a shred of humanity in them - why should this be available. Then suddenly, you realise - if everyone watches this video, no-one would kill anymore. A nasty, degrading and disturbing piee of work that 'passes' itself off as documentary until its gritty last couple of murders - and they are real. I couldn't decide whether or not to give it one star or five, so I plumped for the middle ground. Either way, sick or not, moralistic or not - you have to see this."
4,disturbing but honest.,"I got the DVD of this from the UK. I been interested in getting this film ever since i heard about it when I was in 4th grade. Like everyone else said, this film shows executions from around the world. Also shows Saddam Hussein's rampage as he gassed his own people, why wasn't this footage in Michael Moore's movie, Farenheit 9/11 ?Think about that one.Also, the footage in this film is extreme, although nothing to turn away from,it's not something to eat popcorn while watching.If you want to see people die, get Traces of Death, if you want a historical lesson about executions, get this."
2,An oscar winning performance by all parties.,"This documentry certainly sums up them TOOTSI twisted sad exscuses for God's creation.The doc is fairly mellow through the beginging but towards the end the BRUTALITY and mindless VIOLENCE would disturb even Sadame Hissein himself.It all seems real , maybe because it is..Definately one to be screened on the Jerry Springer show"
3,It's a good start but...,"Okay, I LOVE this band. I've seen them 3 times live and they have terrific energy and vibe. This album's sorta poorly produced though. I love the Wine Song, Days Like These and The Crowd to death but you CANNOT understand how good they are from these recordings, they are just kind of empty and very minimalist. HOWEVER, all that has been fixed with their new album Two Shoes which they are touring now. Judging by the first single Sly, and the song's I've heard live (Car Song, Two Shoes) we're in for a real treat. So buy that one first, then once you're a fan, venture back to this one to hear the unmissables with more appreciation."
5,Fantastic,"I discovered these guys on the web and fell in love with Hello. The sound is original to me and the lyrics are hot, amusing and are not over the top repeatitive like many bands though they are very catchy.A summer sound, with great use of brass. You will love it too!"
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. It is quite short, and I believe it doesn't contain the entire speech."
1,Will this urban legend ever go away????,"Check out the AFU and the Urban Legend Archive. Chief Seattle never wrote this speach. It was written by Ted Perry in 1970 (or there abouts). Oh come on, how could Chief Seattle have known about whippoorwills, buffalo, or trains? None of these existed in Seattle in the 1850s. Ted Perry knew about them though...."
2,Also lasted 3 months,"Much like a previous customer review, my battery only lasted for 3 months. I purchased it in April after my Dell battery conked out after a year of use, and this one died last week, at the end of July.To the seller's credit, they are replacing the battery for free and now have a one-year warranty. I am hopeful that I (and the other buyer) just received batteries from a subpar batch and that this next one will last much longer."
5,Drop in replacement,Its actually lasted longer than the original batter than came with the Dell 600m.
5,Better than expected case,"I did a fairly brief amount of research for a case for me new Q phone and settled on this one, partly because of the previous review and the fact that I needed a case that would allow for my bulkier Extended Battery. After Receiving it I must say that I was very impressed with the case. I expected it to be somewhat cheezy quality. After all it was only 19 bucks. The hand stitched leather case looks very nice and all stitching is tight with no loose ends. I fits perfectly snug so that it won't fall out. Easy Access to all data ports. Super Nice case for a Nice phone. Deserved another 5 star rating so I thought I would provide one."
4,Lovers of poetry -- and wannabe poets -- should read this.,"This is really a fun book. The structure of it is original and ingenious; 85 poets print one of their poems, and then write a short essay about the process of writing the poem. More than any book I've ever read about ""the poet's journey"" or ""the process of writing poetry"" or anything else, this offers insight into the process of writing and the evolution of a work. And it offers 85 different perspectives. I love this book."
5,Deci-delicious,I've been searching everywhere for this fragrance. My mom will be so happy to receive this for Mother's Day. I had to buy myself one as well. What a sweet treat as this is a one of a kind fragrance. This purchase exceeded all of my expectations.
3,not the best,"In my opinion this is a set of lack-luster women`s films. INTERNES is a fairly good sentimental but predictable story of a woman trying to find the daughter she was forced to abandon years earlier. The hospital scenes were too Hollywood and not realistic.THE GREAT MAN`S LADY: no need to pop the popcorn for this one. There`s enough corn here for everybody.THE BRIDE WORE BOOTS: A rather silly and predictable comedy with a few horse laughs.THE LADY GAMBLES: This was the best of the bunch holding your interest to the last frame, although not a very realistic depiction of gambling addiction.ALL I DESIRE: Pure predictable melodrama about a woman who abandons her family for a stage career but then returns years later.THERE`S ALWAYS TOMORROW: An often done story of a single woman falling for a married man as in (STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET).NONE WERE UP TO STANWYCK`S GREATS: SORRY WRONG NUMBER, THE LADY EVE, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT, GOLDEN BOY ETC. ETC. ETC."
3,Stanwyck is always fascinating to watch,This collection is neither the best nor the most famous film performances of of the legendary Barbara Stanwyck. But all films are worth watching because Ms. Stanwyck is always fascinating. Each film has moments that only Stanwyck could create. So I can recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys the films of a very unique American talent.
5,Awesome,This is a great collection of Barbra's work. Some of these movies I was unfamiliar with but I loved every one of them. If you haven't seen these DVD's you owe it to yourself to see them.
5,Barbara Stanwyck Fan,"An excellent addition to my Collection of screen vixens. This is the perfect Barbara Stanwyck collection in each of these movies she's as I like to see her, in total control, daring and strong."
5,LOVE HER!,"i was excited to see this released,""Internes cant take money"" was of course,a wondeful performance from barbara,but there wasnt much to the plot,wich made it a bit boring. ""The great mans lady"" was an amazing film,in my opinion her performance was worthy of a oscar nomination. ""The bride wore boots"" is a comedy,and its a fun film but its not great.""The lady gambles"" i had hope for,but honestly it was very slow and i never got around to watching the whole thing(i'll give it a chance again)""All i desire"" is probabaly one of my favorites out of all of these. ""Theres always tomorrow"" was very good,i liked it alot. for thenext Barbara Stanwyck collection i would like to see;""The file on thelma jordan"" ""No man of her own"" ""always goodbye"" ""B.F's daughter"" ""Blowing wild"" and ""The two mrs. carrolls"""
3,WHERE IS THE GAS IMPROVEMENT MPG AS ADVERTISED,"WHEN ORDERING THESE FILTERS, GOT THEM FOR ALL VEHICLES AND WAS EXCITED ABOUT INCREASING THE MPG WITH THIS AIR FILTER, BUT MY GAS MILEAGE HAS NOT INCREASED AT ALL, IF ANYTHING, HAS GONE DOWN. INSTALLATION WAS SIMPLE AS ADVERTISED, BUT MAYBE SAVING A LITTLE ON NOT CHANGING THEM REGULARLY MAY MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE IN COST, BUT DON'T EXPECT ANY INCREASE IN MILES PER GALLON SAVINGS, OR I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY YET. MAYBE IT HAS TO GET BROKEN IN."
2,Do not wear in chlorinated pools,"Although the shirt is (was) comfortable and I did like it, the shirt did NOT like chlorine. I wore it in my aqua aerobics class and after a couple months it stretched out completely. Not long after that, tiny holes started appearing all over like it was disintegrating! It may be fine for oceans and lakes but I would not recommend pools. I ended up tossing it. :("
4,Awesome movie collection_weak outer box,I have been wanting to purchase this collection for quite a long time and finallly did when Amazon dropped the price to around $20. It is a wonderful collection at an affordable price. My only issue I have is with the outer box that houses the movies. It is not the deluxe box that is pictured in one of the photos. It is merely a lightweight box where the movies slide into sideways. I actually didn't know there was this version of the outer box. I thought it was the heavyweight deluxe outer box which is another reason why I went with this set. For the price though it is still very much worth it. Classic Godzilla films at an affordable price.
4,A terrific collection!,"This terrific collections is a wonderful sampling of some of the most popular Godzilla films from the Golden Age of Toho's fantasy films.It is also nice that some of the titles are quite rare and have been very difficult to obtain in any video format.For the beginner, novice, someone only slightly familiar to the accredited expert, this is a fine collection, handsomely packaged, that would make a wonderful gift and addition to any Godzilla fan...old or new!Mushroom Clouds and Mushroom Men: The Fantastic Cinema of Ishiro Honda"
4,Excellent Value,"I bought this box set for my 9-year-old son who is obsessed with all things Godzilla. I paid less than $20 and got 8 DVDs. He loves them! The video quality is good, and the sound was good, as well. Overall a great buy for such a cheap price!"
5,Finally 7 Godzilla movies in undubbed glory!,"Like many people I loved Godzilla as a child but I have been away from these films for a while. I was intrigued that these films were not only remastered but also avalable in the original Japanese, with subtitles, for the first time as well as dubbed. I absolutely loved hearing the films in Japanese as it lent to these fanciful films a sense of authenticity. These films are just as fun now as when I saw them as a child with Godzilla's Tokyo-stomping an added thrill in widescreen. Also seeing them as an adult brought additional advantages. With the remastered sound I was able to appreciate the musical skills of Akira Ifukube. Also I appreciated the grace and beauty of the Japanese actresses who were pivotal characters in the films, particularly in the original ""Gojira"" and ""Terror of Mechagodzilla""."
4,Memories of Godzilla,"Seeing the original version then viewing the US produced version of Godzilla was great. Having seen both version as a child, it brought back many memories. The subsequent releases of Godzilla were as entertaining as I recalled them."
5,The Godzilla Collection,Nostalia at its best. Great movies for when you don't want to do a lot of thinking.
5,FANTASTIC SET!,This is a fantastic Godzilla DVD set. All the discs have the option to play the Japanese or American voices. My 5 year old LOVES all of them. I am very pleased with this set and I think the box and individual cases look amazing. The movies come in individual cases. The cases are slimmer...about half the size of an original DVD case and they do not snap shut. It may bother some but it did NOT bother me. They look great.
5,The Godzilla Collection,"The movies are in awesome shape. They arrived earlier than expected and I would definitely recommend them and the sellor to everyone. Godzilla movies are hard to find especially at a reasonable price. So when I found these, I was ecstatic."
4,I Loved this movie,"If you have not seen the movie DO NOT READ! The movie opens to the atom bob testing done on a certain island. The wildlife just walks around and does not know the danger flying above. All of a sudden boom! A mushroom cloud rises on a nearby island. After the nuclear explosion one lizard egg appears to remain. Leading off to a two year reign as my favorite movie until x-men came along. The movie is about a hybrid of lizardous creature name Gojira (Godzilla) The lizard romps through a middle America type town on its way to new york. I liked this movie because the effects are great the plot rocks and the new lizard is awesome looking. The babies look and act like velociraptors and godzilla like a fish eating tyrannosaurus rex. Seriously folks, The critics are wrong and this movie is good if you pay attention. You will like the movie!"
3,"So far, so good","Finally, a comprehensive set of early Godzilla movies with the Japanese versions intact. This is the set to get. Now I have to get rid of my second DVD copy of Godzilla in less than three years."
2,Some memories are best left as is,"As a big fan of this stuff when I was a kid, running home during Monster Week to watch the the ABC After School Movies, I could not believe how bad these movies really are. But they do have a certain unique quality to them which really works well on kids. My son and daughter love these movies, and the subsequent Godzilla games on the video systems and all of that really ignite their imagination. The transfers are about as good as can be expected I guess, as these films had poor audio and dubbing back then. Funny anecdote, my son is three and he has already seen the Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick (A disaster of a film, mind you) and when he watched the first film in this series he was all pissed off saying that that was not Godzilla and that it looked phoney. But he has warmed the the films and watches them all the time. Last note, the packaging is fanatstic and worthy of even a Coppola or David Lean collection."
2,"Not the set pictured! - July, 2011","Be aware that though the set is an excellent value at $19.99 it does NOT come with the elaborate box case pictured. It is in a simple flimsy box sleeve.A great deal for seven awesome films with outstanding extras on the discs, but if you want the elaborate box pictured do NOT purchase this from Amazon."
2,"Repetitive matching game, not much learning.","My 5 year old son does enjoy I See Sue, but I hoped for a more educational experience than this. The little informative elements are not interactive and he learned most of the content from a night of reading a good dinosaur book. Not recommended by a mom who prefers her child to be gaining a little more out of time spent on a computer."
3,We liked it!,"Well, kids are different, aren't they? My 5-year-old liked playing cards against the computer to match the dinosaur parts, he liked seeing his dinosaurs appear on the various gameboards, and he liked the ""prizes"" which were coloring pages he could print out. It IS repetitive, but often kids this age like repetition. I wouldn't say it's highly educational about dinosaurs, but just as we don't have only one kind of book in our collection, we have a variety of software. I can tell my son enjoyed mastering this game."
1,An unfortunate collection!,"I am a fan of countertenors (Scholl, Bowman, Deller, Visse, Jacobs) but I have to say that this album was a complete dissapointment! This album is a joke!!!I especially like Andreas Scholl voice and although in this album his voice is as great as usual I would advice that anyone wanting to listen to really great examples of this countertenor's voice look elsewhere! Try instead one of the many albums of Bach's cantatas where he has appeared, or maybe his Handel arias album called ""Ombra mai fu"", or even his ""Heroes"" album!"
2,a voice teacher and early music fan,"YUK! YUK! AND DOUBLE YUK!!!!I am absolutely mystified as to why Andreas Scholl, with his fine voice, would be a part of this type of album. It's disgraceful! The voice of Visse is annoying to the point of agony and one hopes that listeners who hear countertenors for the first time on this album won't give up on them.Bertin is passably good but the biggest disappointment is Scholl. The song selections are inane in that they do not fit the voices. To hear ""My Way"" sung by any countertenor is ludicrous; I hope Frankie isn't listening.The only song I found attractive was ""White as Lilies"" sung by Scholl. If you love countertenors don't buy this CD. It downright degrading to the countertenor voice and repertoire!!!!!"
2,Embarassing at best,"One wonders who at Harmonia Mundi thought this was a good idea. While it might be funny, one is certainly not laughing WITH the 'three countertenors'. The absolute highlight would have to be White as Lilies- it is too ridiculous. Apparently it was a big sucess in Asia following its use in a car advert- forget not David Hasselhoff's fabulous singing career in Germany. If you are looking for something with 'countertenors' but in a more popular genre, why not Gérard Lesne's recent release with two french DJs. Human? is available on nave astrée, and while its not funny, it is at least GOOD."
3,Quite Brief,This is quite a good DVD but is a bit too brief. New parents may not know what to do after watching the DVD.
2,Not worth it,"A lot of the information on this DVD was pretty much common sense. I only paid 1/2 retail price for it and still I think I was ripped off. It was 40 min long if that and there was only two main topics, bathing and clothing baby. I recommend you pass this up, save your money and spend maybe $5-$10 on ""Heading home with your Newborn""...yes it's a book but it is much more informative and cost less."
3,Not really worth the money,"We bought this whole series, and the other DVDs were much more helpful. Unless you really dont know how to change a diaper this video is a waste of time and money. The information is true, but really common sense. I wouldnt buy this video if I had to do it over, but the child birth and breastfeeding videos were worthwhile."
4,"Better Than ""Bringing Baby Home""","Expecting our first, my wife and I have bought several DVDs related to childbirth, etc. We first chose to purchase ""Bringing Baby Home"" rather than ""Laugh & Learn"" because the reviews and descriptions made it seem much better. But we found ""Bringing Baby Home"" somewhat disappointing. We really liked the other DVDs in the ""Laugh & Learn"" series, so we came back and bought this one. ""Laugh & Learn About Newborn Care"" is much better than ""Bringing Baby Home"". More comprehensive and better presentation. Very well done like all the ""Laugh & Learn"" series."
2,Just ok,This dvd was very short and a little disappointing. It was about 40 mins and the babies cried at least half the time. The info wasn't all that great but for first time parents it could be somewhat helpful. I would just read up on how to bathe your baby and pass on the dvd. The Laugh and Learn Childbirth class is MUCH more in depth.
1,Little Information,"I expected much more from this video for the price. They went over bathing a newborn and a 3 month old. They also went over swaddling and various baby care products such as lotion, aspirators, etc. you need for baby. To me it was very basic information and for the cost, this video is certainly not worth it. The instructor spent more time showing you how to brush the hair of a boy vs. girl than anything useful. The babies were cute in the video, which is why I gave it one star at all, but other than that I would say save your money."
2,Disappointed,"After watching the ""Laugh and Learn About Childbirth"" I was really looking forward to ""Laugh and Learn About Newborn Baby Care"", and I was really disappointed. Basically all this DVD covered is bathing, dressing and swaddling your baby. I expected so much more. I wanted information on feeding, burping, sleep schedules, etc. When this DVD was finished I looked at my husband and asked ""that's it?"". It really isn't as comprehensive as it claims, which is a shame because it had so much potential. I really like Sheri, and was really hoping for so much more."
2,Very basic,Covers a bath and dressing your baby and that's about it. Could have added a lot more information in the time they had.
3,my sister likes it,I got this for my sister when she had her first baby. She likes it a lot and it's helped her care for her newborn.
3,Definitely Rent or Borrow!,"I am glad I took the advice of other reviewers and rented this item rather than buying it. There is some really good information in this video, but the amount and depth of information is not exactly what I would call extensive or comprehensive. It is good for one viewing, but I see no need to keep this video around for longer than a day."
5,GERAT BOOK!,"As my son went off to 5th grade this morning I remebered my 5th grade teacher and the stories he used to read to us. Julie of the Wolves was the fist one. 23 years later I can still remeber how wonderful this book is. I am ordering it today for my son along with Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry. If I can still remember these books and how they made me feel this many years later I want my son to have the same experience. (Thanks go out to my 5th grate teacher - Mr. Mercer, Fairmont, WV)"
2,"""Julie of the Wolves""","I go to WMA and in Language Arts class; we have to read a book every month. Then at the end of the month, we give an oral report. I did not like this book that much because the author did not explain the characters that well or their feelings. Nor things were that realistic. Also, that is was long and it did not have that much information. This book is for people you like not that much detail and adventure. You can read it to see, you may like it."
5,Julie of the Wolves is a book of expierence and adventure.,Julie of the Wolves is like a book of dreams and it expresses great feelings. I would recomend anyone to read this book. I think if you read this you would want to go out and reach your goals from the inspiration that this book gives you.
5,THE BOOK ROCKS,it's a very good book about a girl name miyax and her american name is julie she runs away from home because her husband et crazy she gets lost in the alaskan wilderness at the end she goes back to her father it's a great Adventur book.
5,ICS Book Review,"I thought this book was fantastic!It was a book about Julie's everyday life in Alaska and how she hated being married.She than ran away hoping for a better life.Julie found what she thought to be her new family, a wolf pack.She observed them often and became one of them,until they moved on. Amaroq(leader of pack) was shot and his son, Kapu,was injured. Miyax(Julie) took care of him until he recovered. He did and went to lead his pack.Miyax moved on and went to find her father, and to her suprise he had remarried.They sat and talked for a while and when he lft the room, Miyax left and decided to go live with her penpal in SanFrancisco."
5,accurate knowledge of wolf behavior and freedom found a little girl,"This book helped shape my abilty to find myself as a woman. Julie of the Wolves finds herself by not doing just what is required of her by tradition, but by examining her conscience and following her heart. I also learned to read wolf language and understand my dog better by how Julie communicates with the pack and comes to live with them. An excellent read.Wolves: Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation"
3,Needs a little work,"This is an OK book, but it could have beenwritten a little better. I don't enjoy the topic of the story. My favorite character is Kapu. He is playful, funny for a wolf, and a good leader. The setting is in the tundra in Alaska. A girl named Miyax is lost in the tundra and lives with wolves. Then she goes out to find her father. Her conflict, finding her ""dead"" father, is solved. I would not reccomend this book to anyone."
2,Julie of the Wolves,I thought this book was a pretty good book because I like Wolves and Miyax could speek Eskimo. What I disliked was that Miyax got lost in Alaska and I know what's it like to get lost. I wouldn't recommend any people to read this book because it has some pretty tough words in it and sometimes it never makes sense.
1,Inappropriate for Children,"This might be a great book. It's a Newberry Medal winner after all and recommended by many people including teachers and librarians. So I trusted it should be good for my children. But when my 10-year-old daughter got this book from her teacher in her classroom and read the book upto page 102, she said, ""Mom, this part is so gross!"" She didn't even want to mention why it's so ""gross."" She looked just so disgusted and disturbed. When she went to sleep, I grabbed the book and read the page. I simply got shocked. How can this kind of book be recommended for children of this young age? Again, this might be a great book, but it's not for young children. It should be removed from any list of recommended books for children younger than maybe high schoolers."
3,my review for julie of the wolves,"First let me say that the book was not that good over all. some parts of the story was very confusing. I didn't like it at all. For examble:when she talked about cliping off part of the birds wing so she could have a friend. I think that was wrong because birds should be free. One part that confused me was when she made a house. She said that she had i refregarater, but how could u get one if you in the middle of no where. i just thought the book was bad . That is my review for the book julie of the wolves."
5,A great book to curl up on a winter's day with,"This is the story of Miyax, an Eskimo girl who is known to her pen pal in San Francisco as Julie. Julie leaves her home to go visit her pen pal because her father has gone, and she is married to a boy that does not treat her well. On the way, Julie gets lost and has to depend on a pack of wolves to survive. Using her father's words on how to befriend wolves, Julie, becomes one of the pack as she tries to find her way to San Francisco. There are some sad parts to this book, but I really love the great descriptions of the land and the wolves. Definitely a book that will warm your heart."
1,Julie of the Wolves by Jean Craighead George,"I in particular did not enjoy this book. It seemed to wander around aimlessly, and it often lost my attention. I couldn't comprehend as to what the character was feeling, because the author made the character distant and not easily understood. Her life might have been toutching if the author had spent more time on her emotions than her making and mending clothing.If you like books that don't go into depth with the characters, or you simply love the outdoorsy stuff too much to care, then go on ahead and read it. But if you don't, be forewarned that Julie of the Wolves is not the most exciting book in creation."
3,My Review from Julie of the Wolves,"I liked Julie of the Wolves, but some of it was boring. It was almost like 3 bookes in one. The 1st and 3rd part fit together, and when I finished the second part I relized that was how Miyax (Julie) got lost and started living with the wolves. This would be a very good book for people who really like wolves, because there is a sad part at the end. One of the wolves dies."
4,Julie of the wolves,"When I read the first part of the book i thought it would just be boring.When I got to the first part of the middle I started to read it I just started to fell in love with it. By the time I was done reading it, it felt like i wanted to read it 100 more times. Some of the parts in the book were very sad like when Jello died."
1,Sends the Wrong Message,"I found the ending of this book quite disturbing. For most of the novel, the author portrays the arctic environment in general and wolves specifically in a sensitive manner. However, in the final pages, Julie's father kills the hero wolf by shooting it from an airplane. The author concludes by essentially shrugging the whole thing off. Julie and her dad reunite, and what happened to the wolf (who had saved her life) is depicted as something that's too bad but cannot be helped. Further, it is suggested that this is the way things are going to be and that's that. A bad ending and a bad environmental message to send to young readers."
1,Why on earth did this win a Newbery?!,"I hated ""Julie of the Wolves."" By the time I finished, 15,000,000 questions were swimming in my head, one which was, ""How on earth did this win the Newbery?"" Although Part 1 was good, Part 2 was confusing, and Part 3 was the sorriest excuse for a Newbery award winner I have ever read.I was expecting some grand tale which ended with the sentence, ""And with that, Julie pulled up the covers of her new bed in San Francisco, closed her eyes, and went to sleep."" Instead it was, ""Julie pointed her boots toward Kapugen.""If you like books with weak plots and confusing sentences you must read four times to understand, then you'll love ""Julie of the Wolves."""
4,Not appropriate for young children,"The book is a wonderful coming of age story for the mature reader. Unfortunately, the book's cover gives no indication of the mature subject matter in part II. Prepubescent Julie is the victim of a relationship that would get the perpertrator a nice long jail sentence in our culture. The book unfortunately only describes the ""act"" but does not give a strong judgement against what has happened or even indicate that it was wrong.This would be a good assigned reading book for a discussion group on teen issues. ."
5,"Looking back, this was a great read","First off, I've read some of the ""1"" ratings as was taken aback by the general ""this is too graphic for children"". I'm stunned at this thought. Do you know, children, still today help hunt animals for food, let alone live on farms and ranches where ""gross"" things happen every day? I fear that these children think burger comes from the supermarket.I remember reading this book as a young child and thinking how brave and smart this girl was. How to this day I know about digging snow caves as shelter, because I read this book. Thinking that someone just 5-6 years older than myself, at the time, could survive, was so mind opening. Just think, a lone girl in the tundra could use her wits and training and survive. Just think what I could do!I seriously doubt I'll ever need the survival techniques.I guess kids were made of different stuff 29 years or so ago.(another person mentioned ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"", I say read and enjoy them both."
4,Miyax On Her Own,"I would definitely recommend this book. First of all, you never want to put this book down. You will just want to keep reading to find out what happens next to Julie. Second of all, it has a believable plot, so you can imagine that it is actually happening. Thirdly, it was realistic and interesting, so my mind did not wander while reading this story. This book is recommended to anyone."
5,A Profoundly Sad Story with an Important Message,"I found this to be a profoundly sad and moving story about culture, identity, survival, and ""what truly matters"" in life. I disagree with those who have said that if you're an animal lover, you won't like it. I am an animal lover, and I thought this was a profoundly pro-animal book. The wolves who befriend Julie and help her survive become her friends in the truest sense; the ending is sad and tragic *because* we have come to love the wolves with her. I think the book has a strong message about the importance of respecting and living in harmony with nature. Although I read this book many years ago, I still remember it, and I gave it to my animal-lover niece when she was about 11. She loved it, too."
4,julie of the wolves,"Julie,a young Eskimo girl that loves the eskimo ways,has become lost in the Arctic tundra after escaping her crazed husband,who she married to get away from her aunt.Along the way she finds a wolf pack and when shes out of food she needs to learn how to speak wolf to survife the tundra.While with the wolves she becomes friends with them.In the end julie finds her long lost father,who they thought had been lost at sea for years,and survifes the harsh tundra.Over all from me I would give this book an A+.You wolf lovers and animal lover should check out this exitng novel about wolves and the tundra.Can't wait for the next book,hopefully it has the same wolves."
3,Julie of the Wolves,"This story is about a young 13 year old girl named Miyax. She was living in Barrow, Alaska and married but she didn't like her husband. She runs away from home to reach a boat in Pt. Hope so she can live with her friend Amy in San Francisco. Miyax didn't bring enough food onto the tundra though. To solve this problem Miyax starts to communicate with a wolf pack to get some food. The pack accepts Miyax and gives her food. Now Miyax likes living on the tundra with the old ways of hunting and making things from scratch. Will Miyax go on to the new ways in San Francisco? Or will she live with the pack and stay with the old ways forever?"
4,julie of the wolves,"this book is an exiting novel about a strong young girl trieing to survife the tundra by living with apack of wild wolves and she becomes a part of the pack on the way she has to survife bears,starvation and crazed husbands as she tries to find her way out of the tunda and to her dad.and she makes it to him.My favorit part was when she found torant.From me I say it's a pretty good book"
4,Julie of the Wolves,This is a book that keeps people interested by useing lots of details and wonderful description. I recomend this book to all readers that are now begining to read fluently. This book tells an adventurouse story of a girl lost in the artic tundra heading to San Fracisco while begining to understand and be accepted into a wolf pack. While tring to survive she is having a battle inside her head whether she should go by the old ways or the new ways.
4,Wonderful adventure!,"Working at the Children's desk at the library, I often saw this book and wanted to read it. I was able to get an electronic copy from NetGalley and I really enjoyed it. It is a wonderful tale of a girl on her own in the wilderness. Her struggles for food and companionship lead her to relationship with wolves. The story feels very real. I am eager to put this book into the hands of children here at the library. Especially good for anyone who loved My Side of the Mountain."
5,A very enjoyable read.,"Great writing style, loveable wolves, and lots of action all make this a very good read. It is part of a series of three, however, and this one should be read first, however if you would rather have it from the wolves POV rather than the girls, I would suggest at least reading the third book (Julies Wolf Pack, and my favorite of the series.)"
4,A book that left me thinking about it after I finished,"A young girl is forced to befriend a pack of Arctic wolves as she attempts to escape from an intolerable marriage. The details of life with the wolves was nothing short of amazing; who would believe before reading this story that a girl could live among wolves and who would, after reading it, not believe it? Julie/Miyax desperately tries to survive and find food as she crosses the frozen world of the Arctic. It is only with the help of the wolves that she is able to find nourishment. In return, she helps them in their time of trouble, helping them avoid the dangers of the human world.The book left me thinking about it; that, to me, is the measure of a good book. Julie unexpectedly finds her father, but the reunion is not as she thought. Her father has changed and she has changed. How can Julie go forward? Can Julie and her father once again live together?"
1,Damaging Rape Scene,"This is an inappropriate book for young kids to read. I can't even guess at what age I would be ""okay"" with my children reading the rape of Julie by her husband! Thankfully I read that part before my child. If it made ME feel disgusting and repulsed, what would it have done to my 11 year old?!The rape was the reason Julie ran away but it most certainly could have been written in a hundred other ways with a hundred other reasons for her leaving! Why this author chose to use this violent and filthy scene is beyond me.Furthermore, I am sick and tired of books being rated for 9 year olds that are in no way appropriate for such an age!! Perhaps it's time to start rating books the way movies and music are rated with warnings for content and language."
3,Julie of the Wolves,The book I read was Julie of the Wolves. The author Jean Craighead George gave this book a lot of scary parts. It was a good story but I think she should have made it more exciting. There was a part of the story when she ran away from her husband because she didn't love him. Then she was on her own. If you want to know the end you should read it.
1,A Review from a Parent,My daughter picked up this book because it looked similar to Island of the Blue Dolphins. Parents beware that this book contains an incident of r*p* on page 102.
1,Julie of the Wolves Review by Rashad Abdulla,"""Julie of the Wolves"" was all in all a good book. The setting(the Alaskan tundra)and the characters make it hard to put this book down once you start reading. One of the most unforgettable characters in the story is Amaroq, the leader of the wolf pack that adopts the main character, Julie.Julie ran away from a marriage with another Eskimo named Daniel. She didn't want to marry him, but her father had disappeared and she had nowhere else to go. Her main problem, however, is not Daniel, but getting to Point Hope, where she can get a ride to San Francisco to stay with her friend.She has many adventures with the wolf pack, but it would spoil the book to tell you all of them. I can tell you this, however. Julie lets an Eskimo hunter stay in her makeshift house, and learns her father is still alive. But when she goes to visit him, she realizes that he has changed from th devoted Eskimo he once was.But I can't tell you the rest. It would spoil the book.Rashad"
5,Great book!,"This book is amazing!It's about a young native american who has to survive in the wild,then she comes upon a pack of wolves!This book is great for wolf lovers,you can learn alot about wolves in this book!It's sad and thrilling!Enjoy this great book!"
4,not bad,"julie of the wolves is about a 13 year old girl named mayix who gets lost on the alaskian tundra after running from her husband.julie is slowly accepthd by a pack of artic wolves and begins to love them as though they were family.all in all this book was pretty good althouge it was just a bit boring,espically in part 1"
2,Julie of the Wolves,"Julie of the Wolves is a book about a girl who lives with her father, but is then forced to live with her Aunt Martha because she had to go to school. Later Miyax is forced to marry a boy named Daniel who doesn't treat her right.So Miyax runs away.In the tundra she meets these wolves and uses her fathers words to communicate with them.Then people who knew her father meet Miyax. Now Miyax is determained to find her father. I thought this book was kind of boring and could use more action."
2,Julie Of the Wolves,"EXTRA!!EXTRA!! READ ALL ABOUT IT!! Pinch me I must be dreaming. This book was pretty boring because really all it is, is that she escapes from her husband (against her will) Daniel in barrow, going to point hope but she didn't have enough food, so she had to learn how to communicate with the wolves. She is protected by Amaroq (the leader of the pack) & Kapu (leader of the pups and Amaroq's son). Soon Enough she knows where her father, Kapugen, lives. In between unfortunately Amaroq gets shot & killed. She was thinking"
4,LSMS student,This a great book for people who are interested in adventure like books. The book tells about some Eskimo life and shows how a girl befriends a pack of wolves. But some kids might think of to trying her techniques. That is the only bad thing I have seen in this book. So I don't think this book should be banned or burned.
4,Julie's Wolves,"Julie of the Wolves is the fascinating story of 13-year-old Miyax (Julie) who escapes an abusive marriage after her father dies in a boating accident and leaves her with an adoptive family. She travels across Alaska in an attempt to reach San Francisco, where she can stay with her pen pal, Amy, for a while. But in the dangerous conditions of the Alaskan tundra, she is forced to depend on a pack of wolves for shelter, food, and any chance of survival. To do this, she must learn to speak their language and get them to trust her. After studying their movements and ways of communicating, she is accepted by the wolves and the leader of the pack seems to be taking care of her. Through this experience, she learns much about herself and who she wants to be. But as she nears the end of her journey, she is forced to choose between the old Eskimo ways or the new ways. Any animal lover will love this book!"
4,Julie of the Wolves,"Julie of the wolves is a beautifully worded story that makes you think. It's about an eskimo girl who, through a long journey and the friendship of wolves, rediscovers the values her people once cherished."
4,What a Wonderful Book!,"I just loved this book, even though I'm in my fifties! I think that adults will enjoy this book, maybe even more than their children. The illustrations are superb and the story is full of many subtle lessons on life itself. Her story proves that there really is a soul connection with life between animals and man. She has shown (in a wonderful way) how we can learn from nature, by being patient and observing, before acting compulsively. It also shows how Eskimos are able to live off the land even under conditions as severe as the Arctic. As for the wolves, they have always been misunderstood and Jean George has enlightened the reader about their ways and shows that they are not usually mean unless there is a necessity to be that way. All in all, a delightful little book that is quality reading, to be enjoyed by all."
5,a thrilling story about friendship and survival,"A lovely story about a 13 year old Eskimo girl, named Miyax Kapugen, who runs away from her marrige, to try and reach her pen-pal Amy, in San Fransisco. On the way there, she gets lost on the wild, windy tundra. Luckily, Miyax (Julie,) befriends a wolf pack, and together they survive the cold Arctic winter, and find Kapugen, Miyax's father!"
4,I think this book is a perfect book if you like to read.,I think this book was very exiting.It told about how Eskimos lived long ago.It also told about what kind of clothes they wore. They didn't were usal clothes. They wore parkas that repell the cold. In the book if you didn't pay close atention you would get lost and you wouldn't know what happened because in the middle of the book it goes back in time.I think this book was very fun to read and very exiting. I would recomend this book to 6'th graders.
3,Julie of the Wolves,This book is a story about a 13 year old inuit girl that runs away from her camp and get stranded but met some interesting friends on the way to her penpal Amy in Sanfrancisco.You will never guess who her friends are wolves!!!! One wolf is named Jello he is troblesom also her good friend kapu and alot others but I just wanted to give examples of good and bad friends. Then some people looking for caribou came to her igloo and before she new it she is on a plane!! Now you have to read the rest of the book to find out what happens next. I give this book an A if I was a reviewer. Read it the book is COOOOLLLL!!!!!
3,Julie of the Wolves,"Miyax has been lost in the Arctic for a while now, watching wolves ans trying to get them to help her. As Miyax learns to communicate with the wolf pack, she and her pack get closer to a town. As Miyax and her pack move about the Arctic, dangers unfold. Miyax has to chose between her life with her pack and her life with the other Inuit."
2,Too much Tundra,"In this book, Julie of the Wolves, the main characters consist of Julie, a girl stranded on the Alaskan tundra, and some wolves. After her 13-year-old self gets divorced and runs away, she gets lost on the tundra and relies on her furry friends for companionship and food. Companionship? Yes, that's right. Julie learns to ""communicate"" with the wolves. Food? You mean they kill food and give it to her? Well, sometimes. The wolves also regurgitate the food for Julie's dining pleasure.Although this book may cause readers to take an interest in Alaska and Eskimos, it really doesn't teach much about Julie and her culture. This book is unrealistic and rather dry. It would be difficult to keep a young reader interested in this book. Granted, this book may be a good tool for cooperative teaching. An instructor could relate this book with teaching history and geography, zoology and sociology, but the actual book doesn't offer a true picture of reality."
4,a VERY great book with the child interest rate: 2/3.,"Julie of the Wolves is about a 13 year old girl who is dissatisfyed with her surroundings at home and leaves to a land that her ancestors(Eskimos) dwelled. She makes contact with the wolves that live in the area. Julie (the main character) enters the pack and depends on the wolves for life needs, just a little bit, though. That was the first part. The second part was the part that was boring and extremely inappropiate for young readers. It displays the reason for Julie's journey to such uncomfortable surroundings. The third part was the best with a suprising ending. Thats why the common child would be interested in two out of the three parts in this book. (2/3) Overall, this book was exciting and interesting and it will be a favorite if you read it!"
4,Julie of the Wolves,"This book is fairly engaging, especially for the first part. It is well written and exposes readers to a very different value system and lifestyle but the end is rather depressing. My fifth graders seemed to like it."
3,Julie's Story,"Julie of the Wolves is a fantastic book if you want to learn about wilderness skills. In the begining Kapugen sent his daughter, Julie to live with her aunt. Julie began to grow tired of her aunt, so she flew to Barrow to get married to a boy named Daniel as she was told to do. She got very angry and decided to go visit her pen pal in San Franciso. To get to San Francisco, she came across many problems. She had to get across the tundra and take a boat to get there. When she started across the tundra she had trouble getting food. Then she met a wolf pack that helped her get food. When she got nearer to civilization, she met a family hunting that told her her dad was alive. We can't tell you anymore, you will have to find out for yourself."
4,Julie of the Wolves Review,"This is a good book for all ages to understand how to survive if you ever get lost.You would have to take risks like Miyax learned to communicate with wolves to get food,and she had to fit in with the environment to adapt to the changes.This book keeps you interested and you learn a lot too.I recommend it to people of all ages."
3,Julie of the Wolves,"This girl named Miyax (also Julie) finds herself running away from her problem . she is now in the tundra trying to survive. She is cold and starving, but then she sees wolves she tryes to communicate with the wolves so she can get food. she does. Then she has a flash back, when, where, why she is here. She remembers her pin-pal,Amy. she wants to find Amy so she trys to reach POuint Hope. when she finally gets there she doesnt want to leave. then she finds something amazing!"
2,Julie of the Wolves,"This book is about a eskimio girl named Julie/Miyax who needs to find out how to live in harsh weather conditions and no food. Thats because she ran away to see her pin-pal, Amy, and to run away from an engegement. By going on what her father said she tryed to comunicate with the wolves. Watching how they cominicate and trying it herself she was able to tell them what she needes, which waz food and a shelter. Later she comes home to her dad and his non-eskimo wife who doesnt live the eskimo ways."
3,Julie of Wolves CD,The CD does not match the book word for word. The CD is a summation of the book so it didn't help my students w reading along with the CD.
5,A young girl cooperates with a wolf pack to survive,"""Julie of the Wolves"" is one of the best fictional accounts I have ever read dealing with relationships between people and wolves. Dealing with a young Inupiat girl who is running away from home and an intolerable family situation, the story concerns her efforts to survive on the tundra while at the same time cooperating with a pack of wolves whose help she needs to survive. Julie learns much of value by observing the wolves, but must eventually return to the company of humans, after the alpha wolf, which she calls Amaroq(Inupiat for wolf), is shot from an airplane by some hunters. Although the story is contined in ""Julie"" and ""Julie's Wolf Pack"", the poignancy and ambiguity of the ending and the choices Julie has made remain with the reader for a long time."
5,Exellent book a must read for all ages,This book tells the story about how brave people can be and about having to make hard dicisions with the help of friends.
1,Julie of the Wolves is not an interesting book.,"Julie of the Wolves is about a girl named Julie who's dad disappears and she runs away and gets lost. She doesn't have any shelter, protection, or food. She is alone in the Alaskan wilderness until she finds a pack of wolves. She becomes almost like family to them. Especially the leader, Amaroq. This is a fairly interesting book but isn't the best book. It goes to slowly and has lots of flashbacks which make it hard to understand. It also describes the scenery and what is around Julie way too much. This takes away from what is happening to her and what could happen to Julie."
1,Julie of the Wolves,"The book, Julie of the Wolves, is about a eskimo child named Miyax who has to go and live with her aunt to go to school. After the time she has to go to school is over her father Kupugen makes arangements for her to go and marry Daniel. She doesnt like it there so she goes and lives with the wolves and she becomes a wolf child. Then later she finds out her father is still alive and he had changed to a normal modern person and is no longer an eskimo. I didnt like this book because they made it to long of a book with not much information. There wasnt much detail and it was boring."
1,F-,"This is an undeniably awful piece of writing. Jean Craighead George is so overated. Whenever someone tells me that they read a bad book, I say ""Not worse than Julie of the Wolves!"" And they have to agree. Long, dull, and even worse than my side of the mountain or the other side of the mountain."
1,Terrible book!!!,"Julie of the Wolves is absolutely terrible book. During an entire chapter (In the book there are only 3 chapters), Julie have a flesh back to her past and during the rest of book she and the story is going NO WHERE. Pages after pages we read unimportant details and flash backs of the girl about her father. The book is over detailed and I must say that it is one of the worst boks I ever read!"
1,Not something I would my child read,"First off I read this book when I was In elamentary school. The reason Julie runs away is because dumb Daniel tries to force her to have sex with him at age 13. Not a subject I want a nine year old to deal with. Second she makes friends with wolves. Wild wolves are dangouous! They don't recomend you even keep a half wolf dog in your house because that predator instinct can kick in and they can kill you, but theese wolves don't see her as a snack they act more like a domestic dog pack. I'm sorry but I don't want my kids thinking wolves are safe. keep a respectfull distance please. I don't rember why my teacher made me read it so the point isn't memorable at all."
2,Julie of the Wolves,"I really enjoyed the first two parts of this book, but toward the third I did not, as it was focused on racial hatred. The first two sections were mainly about her survival in the arctic tundra, and her eventual acceptance by a wolf pack.However, in the third part of the book, the main character is consumed with hatred toward white people and their culture because of a wrong a white hunter did to her. She refuses even to see her white friends again because of her blind hatred and intolerance. She rejects her father as well, because of the fact that he incorporates aspects of white culture (such as technology) into his life. Definitely not my favorite heroine."
3,ICS BOOK REVIEW,Julie of the Wolves was an ok book.I would read it again if ihad to.It was very different and i like books that are different.Iwould encourage u to read this book.
3,It was ok but not the best,I thought that the book had to many details and stayed in the same spot too long.Some of the times you could not tell if she was flashing back or not some of the time.But the book was alright.
3,Not detailed enough!,"When I read this book, I had a very hard time seeing it. The detail was very poor. If it were more detailed, I would have given it four stars.I also cuoldn't get into the characters very well. The story was nice though!"
1,Not a water resistant ink,I purchased the pigment ink since it is supposedly more waterproof than the regular black ink. I tried it on three different types of Primera labels and it completely ran off of all three substrates. Now I've been forced to purchase another of these rather expensive cartridges. Total waste of money!
5,Excellent Slip on,Very confortable slip on I trully recomended as well as the seller. The item arrived in great conditions.
5,best most comfortable shoes,I have using this shoes for more than 3 years it's so comfortable I got 3 pairs including the latest I ordered.Its durable and comfortable to use.
5,Sketchers are great,I bought a brown pair about a month ago.Love them so much - going back to buy the black pair.
5,nshoes,As expected from amazon stores. Always as described and never a mistake on size or product with quick shipping.
5,proclaim your geekness to the world,"There are different kinds of geeks, but world over, each geek appreciates another geek. Proclaim your geekness with abandon. It's simiple. It's a screen font. You're a geek. Black screen, white letters. You know the score - you've got wires for veins. Also a great excuse for not knowing current events - you're busy wiring the world, you haven't got time to know who the secretary of defense is!"
4,From T and T Clark International,"In what sense does Matthew's Gospel reflect the colonial situation in which the community found itself after the fall of Jerusalem and the subsequent humiliation of Jews across the Roman Empire? To what extent was Matthew seeking to oppose Rome's claims to authority and sovereignty over the whole world, to set up alternative systems of power and society, to forge new senses of identity? If Matthew's community felt itself to be living on the margins of society, where did it see the centre as lying? In Judaism or in Rome? And how did Matthew's approach to such problems compare with that of Jews who were not followers of Jesus Christ and with that of others, Jews and Gentiles, who were followers? This is volume 276 in the Journal for the Study of the New Testament Supplement series and is also part of the Early Christianity in Context series."
2,Frustrated...,I was so looking forward to listening to this opera and what I downloaded was soprano arias and the rest of the opera is in a kind of instrumental version... very frustrating. I ended up having to purchase the CD of another version that is complete. What this CD is should really have been more clear.
4,With Honors Review,"""With Honors"" is one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. At the beginning Monty is concerned only about himself and his success at Harvard by writing his thesis. However, when he is forced to associate with Simon in order to get his thesis paper back his entire perspective on life changes. This showed me that Monty wasn't as selfish as I thought, because he cared for Simon and did everything for him, including putting his thesis on the back burner. This movie was based on the true value of friendship, and the college students truly accepted Simon for who he was, not based on his outward appearance. Jack was harsh about Simon at first, but finally came around, and realized that you can not always have what you want in life, and it means a lot to others when you treat them as if they are important and with respect. This was a great movie with a wonderful message, one of friendship and deciding what your main priorities are. I would recommend this movie to anyone!"
5,honor of honesty,"this is a movie which can show what now is overlooked by so many - you first look at someone from the outside in - you judged, but you get to know them from the inside out and you have an honest friend - with honors! Great show."
5,With Honors,"Where should values be placed? Should one give his all to succeed in life; or place personal gain to the side for the sake of one lonely piece of humanity? In truth, more honor is received with a stone in time."
4,What abour credit of the book>,"What an insightful and delightful movie. What i am desperate to find out is what book the story comes from that is read on the deathbed. I know it is returned to the library at the end of the movie, but didnt notice the title. Can someone help ? Well recommended."
5,DVD With Honors,"Arrived on time, did not have a case but this was put under the comments.....love the movie, very smooth transaction!"
4,With Honors,"When Mr. Moore said we were going to begin a movie in English we all moaned because the movies shown in school are always boring!!! But, this one was different! With Honors teaches a lot about people and character and how much companionship can change a person. The story of the friendship of Simon and Monty is outstanding, viewers see just how much having a friend can change someone's life and give them something to live for."
3,story of love and friendship I liked this movie,"This movie for me was a movie filled with warm hearts and kind mindes, but above all for me it was the meaning of true giving -- giving up ones dreams for a complete stranger."
3,Bum At Harvard,Overly sentimental tale of college kids befriending bum. Ridiculous premise but some OK moments - Fraser is quite good. DVD quality is adequate. Fraser fans should give it a try.
2,Stupid,"To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise. The problem is that his ""wise"" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying. That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character."
5,God would make this CD,"If God was a muscian he would make this CD, if not he would rip it off! Damn it's good! I got this CD last month and I have not been able to get it out of the CD Changer. Smooth groove good for love making to just plain hard F@cking! Get it you wont regret it!"
4,Repetitive manual.,"The Essential Hamster is practically complete redundancy of Barron's Complete Manual on Hamsters. Though excellent in detail, helpful information, and photographs, this is a waste of money if you already own other manuals on this pet. Typical of this type of book, it covers: Feeding, keeping your pet healthy, behavior, medical issues, and the homecoming preparation tips after purchasing a new hamster. There is absolutely nothing new and interesting added to the ""Essential"" series. If you own it, fine. However, if you seek detailed, new, interesting, and superior all around material, purchase the Barron's Complete Manual on hamsters instead of this."
2,Far too simplistic,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who has any knowledge of hamsters. Although it touches on a lot of information that may be needed by someone who has never owned a hamster it is lacking in comprehensive information that I believe is necessary to have a happy, healthy pet. It seems to be aimed at either children or people who know nothing about hamsters. I would have prefered a book that included more information on health and diet. I found that those sections were not nearly detailed enough and it would be of greater benefit to have specific information about certain ailments, diseases and dangers. [...]"
5,Spiritual Insights and the Cost of Discipleship,"Fr. Braga, one of the founders of modern Orthodox monasticism in North and South America, gives testimoney to his personal experience of living and walking in the Spirit in this slim volume of recollections and essays.Fr Roman, who is the abbot of Holy Dormition Monastery in Rives Junction, Michigan, was a teacher in Romania when the communists came to power. Not willing to teach their athiestic propaganda, he was imprisoned for several years, much of the time in solitary confinement with frequent torture.He is a true man of God, who's insights are penetratingly simple and direct.Another book of interest, from a similar confessor of Christ, is the story ""Father Arseny"" and a second volume ""Cloud of Witnesses"", both of which recount Fr. Arseny's trials and victories in the Soviet ""reeducation"" camps."
1,useless product,I ordered this product thinking that I can use it between dyeing but it is totally useless. It easily dissolves in sweat or rain. Worst part it will get on to clothes.
3,Might be OK for money,"This product may actually exemplify a good value for money. However, with fear and suspicion of the odor to never disappear in the future, I need to sell all of these for almost nothing in Craigslist. I am unable to return because I have discarded the original carton of the assembled four. I will give away the assembled four and unassembled two for almost nothing."
2,The other reviews were right!,"This toy does not work as promised, gets stuck while turning and doesn't properly turn into a mermaid or back to Dora. I am glad I got it for less than half price. My daughter did enjoy it for a while, but she didn't even notice when Dora, uh, went to the farm (was donated to another ""lucky"" child)."
1,fun while it lasted,I bought this for my 4yr old for Christmas and it lasted all of 2days before it broke and stopped working. I had a very disappointed child on my hands.
2,Dora sparkle and twirl...not worth $30.00,"i, LIKE MANY OTHERS, FOUND THIS ITEM WAY BELOW THE COST OF RETAIL OF 30 BLUCKS AND BOY AM I GLAD. FIRST, AFTER REPLACING THE BATTERIES, THE DOLL GETS STUCK IN THE TWIRL, GOING BACK AND FORTH AND NOT MAKING ANY SOUNDS. MY DAUGHTER LOVES DORA, SO THIS IS JUST A MINOR FLAW TO HER...BUT THEN AGAIN, SHE IS ONLY 3...AND THE DOLL ITSELF HAS A SEASHELL YOU CAN PRESS AND THE DOLL IS SUPPOSED TO DO SOMETHING..WHICH IT DOES NOT, EITHER ON OR OFF THE BASE. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY CHILD ABOVE 4 AND DEFINATELY NOT AT REGULAR PURCHASE PRICE."
1,"Busted skirt, broken hearted daughter","Same problem as the others, skirt works occasionally. Poor kid thinks it needs batteries. Unfortunately, she trashed the packaging in her excitement and we didn't notice it was broken until the Christmas trash was long gone. No details on how to correct the problem available anywhere either and it's obviously not an isolated incident.Overpriced and poorly made."
2,It's just okay,"My child (4 years old) likes this toy, but all it does is spin around, use batteries, and the ""tail"" goes up and down. Fortunately, the doll is removable from the base, but she doesn't play with it that way.I only purchased it because she'd seen it on TV and requested it for Christmas."
2,No sparkle here.,"Terrible waste of money! My four year old was so dissapointed when she finally got this for her birthday. It does talk and move and sing but the skirt does not retract fully. Instead of turning around it gets stuck and goes back and forth over and over and the skirt doesn't fully retract. Because this a mermaid doll she was expecting to bath with it. She couldn't understand that this mermaid doesn't go into the water. Very large and chunky. I figured it being a ""SPARKLE"" Dora the base or something would light up or be sparkly but there are no sparkles except on the malfunctioning skirt. Big dull dud. Don't waste you money."
2,daughter is happy- - parents are not,thank goodness we got this product on sale from amazon; like other reviewers our dora twirled flawlessly a few times before her skirt got stuck and did not work properly anymore; my daughter still likes to play with it and in the end that's all that matters to us; not worth the retail price but ok if you get it on sale
4,We haven't had any trouble with this doll.,"I was rather worried about the quality of this product after the low ratings others have given it, but our doll has worked well. Her tail fully retracts and hasn't gotten stuck at all.Something that I didn't realize is that some other Dora dolls(rainbow, coral, starshine, etc.) will tell stories when put in the base that comes with Mermaid Dora."
2,Not what it looks like!,"From the look of the picture you think you are getting the entire tail gate handle and lock. This is not the case, you are only getting the locking devise!! I could have purchased the locking devise for about half of the cost of Pop & Lock!!!!!! So look for a better priced item, that does the same job for hale the money."
4,Nice,Good product. Not sellers fault but was actually looking for the whole handle assembly as mine has broken. The picture had me thinking it was. But came as locking handle for already installed handle and base plate
5,Quite an eye-opener.,"A very interesting, informative and unique book. Hitler's Youth really confirms stories I've heard in the past that seemed unreal."
5,This book is not only for young people,"This is another great book in the Scholastic Series, but at 67 I found it very, very informative. As you read the reviews you will find this is the story of the 'Hitler Youth' and the part they played in Nazi Germany. Our children are our greatest asset but how we raise/train them is on our shoulders. Hitler exploited Germany's youth for his own evil plans, as this book clearly explains. It's a great read for ALL, young or old!"
1,Hitler Youth,"The book I read is called Hitler Youth. It was written by Susan Campbell Bartoletti. It is a non-fiction book. This book is all about the life of the kids who followed Hitler. It follows the life of a couple of kids. At the very begginning one of the main characters dies. Hitler was so mad, that he named an official day after the kid. I liked this book more than I thought I would. it is very cool and suspenseful. I think it is more for adults."
1,Get 'em while they're young.,"Yet another anti-German hate book for kids.WWII has been over for sixty years,isn't about time we called off the hate campaign?How many more generations of kids are we going to brainwash with this garbage?The war is over,the hate and propaganda should be over too."
1,Ancient and Awful,This tape is from 1988. They didn't even use a tri-pod. It's all hand-held amateur footage that looks like somebody's home movies. There is nothing informative and the video looks so bad it makes me want to stay away from Singapore. I was always told it was a beautiful city. Can't tell by this junky tape.
5,Great for Colds,When the cold and flu season come around I always rely on this green tea to keep me healthy and not get sick. sometimes I still get sick but I'm always the last one to get sick in my family. I think this green tea is one of the reasons as it has a lot of stuff in it that helps build up your immune system. I always mix a big spoonfull of honey in this and some goji berries. Very good!
5,great flavors at yogi teas,"this is a nice smooth green tea. actually, I have tried many flavors of Yogi tea, and they are all lovely. bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep. egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it, and the women's formulas help with hormonal issues. I have not found a bad flavor. : )"
3,One additional way to gain Antioxidant reduction,Have been drinking this tea for a few weeks and like itwith a bit of added agave. Will look for a caffine free greentea next time.
2,Taste is not for me,I would have to agree with the other 2 rating. There is a sweet smell and taste I cannot pinpoint and truly do not care for it. Maybe its the lemon grass not sure but cannot tolerate it AT ALL.
1,Why do they all taste like licorice?,"I ordered three different kinds of Yogi tea based on the great reviews -- lemon ginger, stomach ease, and green tea super antioxident. Unfortunately, they all taste exactly the same -- like licorice. If you like licorice flavor, you'll like this tea. If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere."
2,tastes like perfumed soap,"I am a daily herbal tea drinker. I prefer green teas, but also love red bush teas. I used to drink fruit teas and even longer ago, I drank black teas before going caffine-free. I never thought I would not like a tea. Well, this is the first one that makes me cringe and I wish to never drink it again. Unfortunately, I bought 6 boxes here at amazon with many individually wrapped bags, and I don't want to throw my money away, so I will drink all 6 boxes (I did leave one at a family member's house, just to be rid of a whole box). I bought one box of the Yogi Blueberry Slim tea at the store (one box only to test it first) and it's quite good. As the title of my review states, this tea tastes like perfumed soap, so I can't recommend this super anti-oxidant flavor. I do love the little tags attached to the bags carrying wise sayings :)"
2,Yogi Rejuvenation tea is better,"I've tried many of the Yogi teas, and I really don't like the taste of this one. I recommend the Rejuvination tea - it is a green tea that also fights free radicals and aging, but it has a much smoother taste."
4,wireless glow controller,this product was better than we had expected it works great the only problem we have with it is that the a button sticks every now and again but other than that its awesome
4,"Good controller but,","This is great controller and mine was great it didn't have any probloms and its been 3 months. The only thing is, it uses 4 AAA batteries and I bet you the light uses more juice then connecting to the reciever. I had to change the batteries after 3 weeks. The only time the light turns off is when the battery is low."
1,Xbox Wireless iGlow Controller,The controler looks very cool with the glow feature but the joy stick broke like on the 2nd day of use. Not very durable.
1,Beware of this controller!!!,I plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver. The receiver light kept blinking which means that it didn't recognize the controller. After several tries I decided that the product is defective and returned it.
1,Heed the Warnings,"Got 3 of these to go with a new Xbox. Because of the reviews on this site, I was wary, and only opened one to test it. Seemed to be working fine, until I realized the left analog stick would not go ""forward;"" my character was stuck moving only left, right, and backwards. Definitely returning these,and looking for something worthwhile."
1,A piece of junk,"literally it lasted me 2 days, it is the most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought. Dont waste your money on this. Seriously."
1,JUNK!,"I purchased a pack of 2 of these in December. My husband and son only play Xbox occasionally, but one of them broke the second time they played. I ordered another and within a short time, a second one had broken in the same place. The left toggle breaks off and doesn't work. This product is very disappointing."
1,"Knobs do not work, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM","I bought 3 now in the past 5 months and you know what, they same thing happens everytime. The knobs have some sort of defect and they are impossible to fix. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET A GOOD ONE THAT WILL LAST, I WISH I WAS SMART ENOUGH AFTER THE FIRST 2 BROKE!I just thought they kids were being rough."
1,BAd Built,This contoller broke the second day my son had it. DO NOT BUY. What a waste of money. The stick that moves just snapped. We were playing a racing game so not that much stree on it.
1,This sign is discriminatory against anyone barefoot or shirtless. there are no health department codes or laws against beingbare,"This sign is discriminatory against anyone barefoot or shirtless. there are no health department codes or laws against being barefoot. this sign is comparable to saying ""no english, no watch, no service"" it is complete bogus, anyone who supports it is discriminatory."
2,Not as pictured,"The outlets are not on the sides as pictured (relative to the plug end). They are on the top and bottom, like most other polarized cube taps that cost half as much.Good build quality, especially for ""made in China"", but I can't use it for what I intended."
4,Good except for one item ...,"This book is very short and quick to read. And that's good. The authors, however, recommend touching students, and that's bad (or worse)."
1,Worst headers ever,Do Not Buy. I got these headers thinking they would fit my truck. They were made to fit. One side went fine. I spent 6 hours modifying the other side to fit. Spend the extra money to get a better brand. I've put in headers before and these were by far the worst quality i've ever seen. I only kept them because of time and it's my mud truck.
4,History by Warfare,"I desired to read a book that could offer a historical overview of Roman history. This book fulfilled.It can exhaust you a bit in the details at times (e.g., the number of men killed in battles; the names of minor office holders). However, for anyone wanting to ""get it all"" in one book, it is a very good source.It is well written and penned with an obvious depth of knowledge and keen insight.The format basically runs from battle to battle. The ancient Romans were no doubt warriors and ruthless political opportunists. Still, I would have enjoyed more detail in the more noble of human pursuits such as art, architecture, culture and religion.I recommend the book."
3,"Good, but poor presentation of details","This book would best serve readers who have a basic knowledge of Roman history. It is a good overview of the political events of the Roman Republic and Empire. Sometimes Mckay does a poor job presenting the details of the events and in these places the narrative is difficult to follow. However, in other places he does an excellent job of explaining concepts, themes and sources."
2,made and priced cheap,good price it was what I needed. had to weld pins so it would function and not fall apart.
2,For show only,The price is good as I have checked around but the filter didn't really do what a filter should do. I guess is just too small for any size tank.
2,"Dull blade, feels cheap and generic.","Bought this knife to use on my BC (Knighthawk) and never did find a place to attach it, part to blame on ScubaPro. However when it comes to the knife, it was very dull from the factory, couldnt cut fishing line, and the scabard made for it seemed very generic. ."
4,Pachelbel's badly underrated,"Despite being a music fanatic and having listened to all types of classical music for over 30 years, Pachelbel had only showed up on my ""radar screen"" a few times. Everytime I heard a piece, typically the ""Canon"", I would make a mental note to get a recording, but then proceed to forget. Once I actually made myself a note, I had problems finding a definative recording with any kind of review at all. I took a chance on this one, but was not disappointed. With the exception of the violin concertos, I have never been a big fan of Bach or baroque in general. I like this Pachelbel CD better than any other Bach I have, perhaps because the music is less encumbered than most Bach. Overall well worth the risk."
3,Easy Read,"Although Devlin is a joint effort by Susan Yanisick and Christine Healy, the writing voice is seamless.This is an easy read set in Ireland, 1500's."
1,Not boring but not captivating,"A romance book should be captivating it should engulf you entirely. You should get ""lost"" in its story line and find yourself at the end. While I was reading devlin I knew I was reading a book. I could not corralate with the characters, I could not and did not feel the passion or the burning desire within characters in the book. Simply it was boring and dull. It did not keep my ""sexual"" attention long enough. Which a romance novel should do."
3,Great except for the purple tint,"I like how easy it is to apply, but my hairhas a purple tint. I am no Marge Simpson.Why don't we remove the purple? Then itwould be 5 star."
3,"Beautiful Effect, but confused as to safety..","As many have already mentioned, this light does get unusually hot after a very short time of usage. The unit I recieved was so hot, if you were close enough, you could see smoke coming from the unit. I am alarmed by this as this makes me wonder how safe the unit is and whether it is a fire hazard. I really do not know much about the lights to be honest and maybe this is not unusual for a light, but I wish somebody would tell me if I should be concerned..."
5,Brings this Stone-Campbell movement together,Articles are brief in some cases and all can be read by a lay person. I recommend this collection of history of a denomination. It also has photos where possible.
5,highly recommended,A fine introduction to Tartini's work with superb performances. This disc has inspired me to delve deeper into Tartini's work. I recommend the Arte de'll Arco series on Dynamic for lovers of Tartini.
1,Worst Service - Do not buy from these guys,"I only wish it were possible to give them no stars, or just red x's. These guys never shipped my order, and even sent me an email telling me a different ship date then Amazon. Once that ship date came and went, I just made a claim to get my money back. A total of 2 months for DVD's that were meant for a father's day gift. These guys are clueless. Stay away from them for sure. You're better off going to Target to buy DVD's."
3,Not what the picture is,I got this for my daughter because she LOVES The Land Before Time movies and her favorite is Little Foot. She likes it but it doesnt look anything like the one pictured...
4,YUMMY,Same good quality I have come to expect from Calrose. First tried it in Hawaii and then I was hooked.
3,boise state hoodie,"The product arrived quickly to my address after I ordered it. The only problem I have is with the product itself. The hood on the hoodie is short. I had ordered a smaller hoodie back at Christmas and found the same problem so I thought if I ordered a larger one I wouldn't have that problem---i was so wrong. The sweatshirt itself is a good fit, but when you try to pull the hoodie up it doesn't fit-and no, I do not have a big head:)."
5,Long may they reign!,"This amazing ""behind the music"" DVD is a treasure for Chieftains fans, fans of Irish music, or fans of great music in general. Their humor, candor and willingness to press the limits of their music not only makes this CD great viewing, but also helps explain their endless longevity. It was a lump-in-the-throat to listen to Derek Bell, recently departed, speculate that he had perhaps 20 more years to live (gone much too soon -- rest in peace, dear friend). I can't recommend this wonderful DVD highly enough."
4,Not a concert,This DVD is not a concert but seems more of a vague anthology of their music and quest to deliver the traditional but expand and except changes in the music they love. It's a rather choppy offering but educational. There are many artists not identified during their own music segments. Tommy Peoples of the old Bothy Band is among these. There are others who get lost in the crowd. It would have been nice if there was a way to identify guests during this DVD. I would add it to my personal collection if I just had to have every Chieftains album or video. I would not if I wanted to introduce this band to my friends.
2,Great Subject Matter....Poor Writing,"I took a class on crime scene forensics in Las Vegas recently and this book was recommended. I'm still trying to make sense of it. The subject matter is fascinating but I'm hoping to find another publication that is concise without endless repetition of facts...sometimes duplicating paragraphs back to back. I kept wondering how all these errors got past an editor....then I found that she published the book herself. No need for accountability there! Other less important errors include Ms. Scott giving Loretta Lynn credit for the success of the song ""Stand By Your Man"" when of course it was Tammy Wynette !! One wonders if she is so lax in fact finding....is the rest of the book factual? The book rambles incoherently and there is no continuity. I'm going to finish it. My curiosity outweighs the blatent literary errors."
2,Written like a TV soap opera,"I was most disappointed in this book. I live in Las Vegas and followed the news stories as the events surrounding this murder unfolded. This book is extremely poorly written and even has many typos and spelling errors. Each chapter only gives the reader a few new tidbits of information, with the remainder being repetitive from the preceding chapters. It is very similar to the Dateline TV murder stories...continual repetition with very few facts sprinkled between the commercials. I was lucky enough to have obtained this book from the library, so I didn't waste my money."
3,"Okay, but returned due to wrong size","When deciding what size to get, I went to the hotslings site itself. After inputting my measurements it provided me with two possible sizes. I went with the 3 instead of the 2 b/c I have a long torso. Unfortunately it was too long probably because I am tall and thin. I returned and did not get the 2 b/c I didn't like the fabric (lint attracter!) either. If you are on the heavier side, go with the larger size, if you are thin, go with the smaller size."
4,A sling for Matthew,"I read several reviews on slings,I even when to a specialized baby store to test slings out. I've used a D-ring sling, a MobyWrap, and now the Hotsling. The hotsling works great for keeping baby happy and safe while doing small chores around the house and its easy and fast to put on. I actually took my d-ring sling and mobywrap back, and not to mention other baby carriers because either my baby wasn't comfortable or they were to hard to put on. The hotsling takes some time to get used too for you and your baby, so don't give up until you've tried it in several different positions, find the one that works great for you and baby. My son is 5mo.and 19lbs and still loves the cradle position. Smaller moms with bigger babies might want to get the next size up, also don't be surprise if your husband makes fun of you at first, then ask you to show him how it works later when he sees how comfy baby is."
3,It's easy to use not not hands free,"It was pretty easy to figure out how to use. But my baby doesn't love it. And it is not a hands free carrier. If you want a easy way to carry your baby and possibly comfort your baby, this will work. But if you want to get stuff done around the house, this isn't the carrier for you. The position of the baby makes it pretty difficult to move your arms around too much."
4,Beware the size!,"I like this product a lot but I only gave 4 stars because of the size. I had to return the size 3 I purchased (it was too tight) for a size 4 (for a newborn).My son loves it, he falls asleep in it every time."
4,great sling,"I bought this sling to assist me in carrying my 22lb 7month old when I had to take my other son to school. I needed to have a free hand and this sling allows me to have 1 and 1/2 free hands. My 7month old is very squirmy so I almost always keep a hand on him for safety reasons. It is very easy to put on if you watch the video and after about a week of using it took me less than a minute to get him in it in the hip carry position. I wish I had found this product earlier when I could have used the other carry positions. It takes a little while to find the most comfortable way to put the fabric over your shoulder , but once I did it does not hurt my back or my shoulder and my back feels much better than when I carry him without the sling."
3,Kind of tricky to use,"Took me a while to get used to how it wears and feels. My baby fussed a lot at first but got used to it pretty fast. Nice for around the house, doing chores and whatnot. Really cute print too."
1,Sky High,"This is not the product I meant to get for my grand children. It is not a movie for children. Apparently there is another DVD called Sky High and it was not made explicit that there are two and that a one is for children and one is not (which I only found out after I had purchased and received this product and my grand children were disappointed)Now, I find out the restrictions on returning this item are very strict and I can no longer return or exchange this product,even though it has not been opened. Thus it is a waste.It would be helpful if the return policy were more user friendly and if there were something on the website stating that there are 2 different movies with the same name.Thank you"
3,"Not bad, just not actively good","I've watched this movie twice and I can say I do enjoy it. It is a very interesting but somewhat slow. You'll need to watch it more than once, and you'll need to do it when you won't be interrupted over and over. It's one of those movies you actually have to ""watch"" to understand."
3,Being Human,Bought it because I remembered it from years ago as magical. It's not. It's ok for a rainy day.
3,"Spring Heeled Jack, AWESOME! This Video, Not So Awesome :(","Spring Heeled Jack is one of the most amazing bands ever to exist. Their cds were awesome, live shows completly insane, and if you ever go to meet them they were great guys. This video doesn't show much of that. The video quality of most of this video is pretty bad. It's like they took every 3 frames and put it together. The audio of most of the live performances is filled with scrathes.If you are a super SHJ fan, then check out the video. Otherwise just stick to listening to the cds because they do this band much more justice then the video."
5,SHJ ROCK!!,"Umm...Spring Heeled Jack is a great band, you shouldn't be looking at reviews you should be ordering this video!"
4,If you don't like to work with fondant...,"If you prefer not to create 3-D figurines in fondant, then this is would be a great book. It was published in 1988, when fondant wasn't all that widely used. The 3-D figures are made with cut up ice cream cones that are stacked and covered in buttercream and brushed to create smooth figurines. A lot of decorators now use fondant and other rolled icings to create figurines so these look a little dated. The recipe included is a decorator's recipe with shortening as the base, not very tasty, but is needed to stand up to the techniques and piping.The pros to the book are that it does go into detail on how to shape and brush piped buttercreams by using hot water, fine brushes and a palette knife to smooth piped buttercream. Since not many books cover this anymore, the techniques in the book are worthwhile to reference back to."
1,Not for me.,I was not pleased with this book and returned it. Just not something that I thought I would ever do.
5,It is available on DVD.,"For those of you who are tired of waiting for this to be released on DVD in the US, you can order it from www.amazon.ca. It is available in Canada. It's Region 1, so there's no problem playing it. Of course, your shipping is going to add about $10 to the cost; but I considered it acceptable to pay just over $20 in total to have this on DVD."
3,Not from New England,"Contrary to one reviewer's spirited defense of Jennifer Jason Leigh's speech mannerism in this film, Dorothy Parker was from New Jersey not New England. That aside, attempting to reproduce vocal mannerisms is counter productive if it results in a substantial portion of the audience being unable to understand the main character's dialogue. A flawed attempt at an interesting subject."
3,Dorothy in Wonderland,"The subject of this film is not really very filmable and the Anglo-American accents seem rather deliberately and self-consciously affected and dated. Of course this covers by-gone times and things were truly quite different.Mrs. Parker was not a very happy woman to begin with. Her poetry attests to that. She understandably surrounded herself with people who were quite remote on purpose and set herself up only once in the film, all to come toppling down. This ""vicious"" group was a bit like the community of Hollywood actors who have trouble deciding what's real from the artifice. Their remoteness was ""safe"" for them although probably not particularly rewarding in any personal way.Sometimes during the film I wondered if the color scheme should be reversed. The recitations of Parker's poems should have been in color and the repartee in black and white. Of course that would never sell...Curtis Stotlar"
1,Difficult to understand Jennifer Jasan Leigh,I agree with the reviewer from New York. Leigh mumbles through out. I gave up half way through. Don't want to work that hard to understand what the actors are saying. Thougt it would be flip and funny. It was dreary and dim.
3,Virtually Unintelligible Leigh,"I truly wanted to love this movie after a long lifetime spent reading about the Round Table. I've also read the works of all the writers portrayed, plus James Thurber's wonderful ""The Years with Ross"" about the early years of the New Yorker magazine and it's founder and editor, Harold Ross. There's much that is tragic about Parker's life, and some of those around her, but the tragedy here is that Parker's brilliant words are so swallowed and garbled by Leigh that after about five minutes, I went back to the main menu, hoping to find my way to a selection of subtitles that would include English, so I could actually understand Leigh - no such luck. Those of you who can understand anything said by Bob Dylan may have better luck. It's a shame because everything else about this film isworth watching, though Crawford seems a poor choice for MacArthur."
3,Deceptive photo,"Although I received the idem(s) in a timely manner I felt deceived by the Photo attached to this product. The photo shows a 2 Pack Box of Polaroid film, so I expected 10 packs of the Polaroid 2 pack boxes. I still ended up saving money with the 10 single packs of Polaroid film but felt deceived by your use of the 2 Pack Box of Polaroid film in your picture. I hope that you correct this for the future."
4,Good customer service,I had received my polaroid film in a not very well packaged box. I had called customer service and received a prompt resolution to the issue of the film that was damaged. Restockit customer service did their best to do what they could and I felt satisfied with the outcome.
1,Poloroid 600 instant film,"Poloroid stopped manufacturing this instant film .As a result, merchants that have stockpiled this film are charging significantly higher prices for available film. Good alternitive is to look into Fuji instant camera which is supported by FIJI INSTANT film. They are very comparatable to the Poloroid system at a more reasonable price and is easier to find many merchants selling these items."
3,good for what it is,I had to buy Polaroid film for our school. This was the best price and was delivered quickly. The product is what it is.
1,Displeased with the Polaroid film from MGI Warehouse,"I was very displeased with the Polaroid film as the company replaced the size 600 with 977, which did not work in the 600 camera. I am having a problem communicating with that company as it is very hard to get any means of communication. They do not accept an email with the notification and I had a really hard time finding a phone number. I also was not asked if the film could be substituted. When the package arrived there was no packing slip nor a copy of the charges."
3,Good but expensive,"I think the service is correct, time to receive the purchase also quite short.But I could find the same CD in my home surroundings and it was quite 20 Euros cheaper. I could have paid it 40 in place of 60 !"
1,Pioneer- 3x close-up lens,"I am very disappointed in this product because it can not be used with my underwater camera, Sealife DC500.The web information led me to believe that this was the right lens.I no longer have the receipt so cannot return it."
4,"Great Product, But Contains Beef Gelatin","Overall, this is a great product. The caplets are large, but soft and easy to swallow. No fishy burps thus far (consume with food - it does seem to help). You get a fairly large amount of the active ingredients (EPA and DHA) with each pill. Unfortunately, nowhere in the product description here online does it list that the coating of the caplets are made of beef gelatin. I'm semi-vegetarian (some fish in my diet, but no red meat or poultry of any kind), so I was a little disappointed to find this on the label. No more gel-caps for me after this bottle is done!Overall, my one complaint will not be a big deal to most others and otherwise I find it an excellent option for getting those all important Omega-3's, so I'd recommend it to those who do not mind consuming a little cow along with their fish!"
2,Not alot of bang for your buck,"I purchased this book expecting a decent sized paperback. I was very disappointed to see that it was spiral bound with a laminated cover and pages that looked like they had been xeroxed. The content of the book is OK if you already have a job in the industry, but if you are looking for something entry level like myself, you will be disappointed. My advice? Don't waste your money, you can find all of the information in this book on the internet."
5,I can't speak highly enough for every page in this book,"This is the best manual I have ever read for job search. It is not only the absolute first and last word on getting a job in the fashion industry, it applies to all fields. Every type of possible resume necessary to get into the fashion field is included, with accurate names of companies that truly apply to each job. Tips provided include: a page of several hundred action verbs that can be used to pump up any fuzzy job descriptions such as was in charge of to ""transformed"", ""reorganized"", ""consolidated"", ""established"", etc. This one page was worth the whole book. Two other pages in the book list sample accomplishment statements that work universally for any job."
2,what is this,"This sets meets the typical viewing standards, however, if you look at it closely you can see that at the core the disc is the weak part in the way it is manufactured. There are only three springs and if that isn't enough to degrade the performance, at the ends of each spring the is a piece of plastic used for absorbing the shock transfer. I would not recommend this product and am already having problems with it. I don'tthat driving with it; thinking it is going through a brake in process will do any good. It is just a poorly manufactured disc. I now have to order another clutch assembly and go throught the erplacement process again. As if it weren't enough of a pain to do it the first time. What a disappointment."
5,Great!,"This is a very scholarly and wonderful book about the history of Macedonia. For those interested in Phillip II and his son Alexander the Great, this book gives a general history of the period and of the people involved."
5,ymm,"It's not as sticky chewy as other more recognized brands. It's soft and sweet, not too bitter. At only 90 calories, it's quite filling too."
5,I will order again!,"If you like fairly sweet and sticky licorice, you will enjoy this product! I was very happy with the quality of the product shipped and would order again."
3,Extremely Cute,"I gave these earrings to my 6yr. old daughter as a Birthday gift. They are the perfect size for a small child as well as extremely cute. I did however,have a good amount of trouble getting the screw backs to fit. They are small and the opening for the screwbacks did not seem to fit the posts. Once I got them to fit, they looked absolutely adorable on my daughter's ears."
2,Stud not long enough,"Stud not long enough and it bent when I tried to put in the back in, the price was ok"
4,great slide-off-your seat excitement,"Elena Vargas is an 8th grade student at Metier High. She is about to turn 13.On her thirteenth birthday,she begins to have strange visions,like what questions wil be on a test. But then the visions turn for the worst,and she sees a vision of a terrifying creature with black disk eyes, chasing her through the woods....."
5,Sort of dumb,"The book was good, but I was confused about the part of Kate Kellison and Elana Vargas. This book was *not* about Kate Kellison, so which book is Kate in? This book was about Elana. It's her bithday and she goes to the mall and sees a fortune-teller. She lights the candle she got. Next day, she has visions that come true. I liked the math test one where she proved to that girl that they'd have a pop quiz. What happens to Elana though...........?"
2,A new composition based on Machaut's Mass,"I own several of Peres's Ensemble Organum CDs. This is the only one I don't like. Machaut was perfectly capable of composing wild music and getting it down on paper (a ragtime version of Gais et Jolis, anyone?). I do recommend Peres's other chant recordings: in single-line and organum-style chants their approach is an ear-opener, and they have tremendous nuance in their approach to pitch. But if you want to get a feel for what Machaut actually wrote, you have to go to another recording: the Oxford Camerata is an incredible bargain if you can get it, and quite good. The Oxford was my 4th version of Machaut's Mass, and the first one I am happy with (although I'm tempted by the Lay of the Fountain on the Hilliard Ensemble version.)"
2,This is not a rc plane!!!!!!!,I Bought it just because i thought it would fly. It is the worst airplane i'll ever buy. This thing is so stupid.
1,This airplane is not an rc airplane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I Just got the Package to day it's Nothingbut Tissue Paper and very Flemsyit's Nothing But a Model don't buy this Plane unlessyou just want a Regular Model!
2,Ogoni's Agonies misses the mark.,"Na'allah's text is comprised of a substantive quantity of poetry, making the volume lean towards a poetic anthology for Saro-Wiwa. Many of the items are genuinely emotional, though not very poetical.The articles are divided evenly between: (a) previously published and still accessible material; and, (b) new, politically contextualized pieces. The latter work very well.The general quality of the editing is good, though continuity suffers in the assessment of Saro-Wiwa because of the mix between poetry and appraisal. Occasionally the writing of individual entries is abominably dull because of an elementary sense of stylistics and the most rudimentary grasp of rhetoric. That said, the book is a serious tribute to Saro-Wiwa, well meant."
5,NIGERIA ON THE CROSS ROADS,"No single event has exhibited as clearly, the depths into anarchy and lawlessness which Nigeria's military has plunged the West African nation than the judicial murder of renowned writer and minority rights activist, Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995. This volume of essays and poems is a befitting tribute to a hero who literally laid down his life for a just cause: the unrelenting crusade against the rape and debasement of his homeland by multinational oil corporations, that without conscience, provided self-sustenance for a completely corrupt and evil military junta.In addition, the publication provides a lucid overview of the literary output of Saro-Wiwa over the years and presents them in clear perspective against the inimical background in which the writer labored tirelessly.This is a book recommended to all people who desire justice in a world increasingly threatened by the evil spectre of ""might over right""."
4,Cozy mystery,"This was a cute mystery. At times, the answers to some of the mysteries seem obvious and one doubts the intelligence of the protagonist (herself a college professor.) The imagery of sailing on the Maine coast is often vivid. All in all, this is a very cozy mystery that makes you want to continue solving crimes with the hero."
2,Boring Mystery,"This is a boring book. It takes forever for anything to happen. It's mostly just the main character judging everyone while she is involved in an immoral relationship herself. All that aside, there aren't really any likable characters. It almost seems like this book was written for snobby white people.I've not read any of the other books in this series, but I know I won't after reading this one."
2,Good read,I like the story but some of it was hard to understand. I would have liked it to be translated better.
3,Worth the money,This headlight represents great value for money - the light beam is strong and the battery life is excellent.The band that secures the light is easy to fit but when I tried to move the light to another bike the locking system failed.It's essentially a disposable lamp - use it 'till it dies then buy another. Don't plan on switching it between bikes and you'll be fine.
2,Flimsy construction,"I was disappointed with this light. I used it for six months on a daily five mile round trip commute. The light beam, battery life and handlebar mount were all very good but the construction of the light itself is very flimsy. The top cover over the batteries does not seal tightly allowing water to seep in and it is easily lost. The clear front part containing the bulbs and circuit board eventually broke off just by normal handling. I could not reattach it since the very thin wires also broke away from their solder joints. The switch on the back of the light does not have a positive ""click"" and can be easily activated unintentionally.This light is good for only occasional use in a dry environment. I bought aPlanet Bike Beamer 3for a couple dollars more and it seems like it is much better made and water resistant."
4,"A ""To Be Seen"" light, not so much a ""To See"" light","Bike lights generally fall in to two categories: ""to see"" or ""to be seen"". This light does illuminate a bit in front of you but not enough to go fast in the dark without worrying about hitting something. The light is surprisingly small (about the size of two fingers).The switch is very well designed in that you hit it once and the light turns on solid, hit it again and the light blinks, hit it a third time and the light goes back to solid. This is nice if your ride takes you alternately through well lit high-traffic areas (blinking mode) and dark low-traffic areas. To turn the light off you hold the switch down for a couple of seconds. This way you never accidentally turn the light off when changing modes.Light is not very water-proof. I left the light on when I washed my bike and the insides were soaked. Worked just fine after it dried.Mount could be studier...but it is OK."
1,Complete Garbage,"Bought one last night during a ride because my rechargeable was drained and I wanted at least to be seen.Directs so much light upward, into the eyes (like looking right into an LED flashlight), that night vision is spoiled and does not throw nearly enough light forward to see anything useful about the road. The pivot on the bracket is a non-locked Philips screw that allows the light to rotate at the slightest bump. This lamp is so badly designed that I will avoid any Cateye products in the future because they obviously have no respect for their customers or regard for their safety.It might be a temptation to put this on a child's bike because it is cheap but only if you want to get rid of the child."
4,Absolutely Wonderful,"Absolutely wonderful after a long day's work. Drop them in the bathtub, kick back and relax."
2,too raucous,"I'm a big fan but this album is a blues reincarnation that doesn't turn me on though those into white blues would?It sounds like music for a blues dive on a Saturday Nightl out. Hearing him sing blues in ballads ( like Blue Melody or Drifting ) I know he could have put in more soul and diverse inflection.I think Lee Underwood explained it in ( recommended) biography "" Blue Melody"" written by his right-hand-man guitarist when he said Tim Buckley needed money at the time to support his family. Yes eager to explore new styles but he was out to make something with a wider appeal and more commercially solvent at the time. The price he paid for an insistance on artistic freedom depressed him at times. Maybe his wife nagged him into it ..!!"
5,Tim's Blazin' Best,"Despite loving and being inspired by most of Tim's music for over 25 years, I've never been able to embrace the avant-garde self-indulgence (in my opinion) of Starsailor and Lorca. For me Greetings From L.A. is Tim's most honest album: not just in the sexual confession and longing of the lyrics, but even more so in his willingness to ROCK and have a damned good time. The whole band is clearly enjoying every minute and swings and grooves beautifully.Music's ultimate purpose is to express the joy of the soul and Tim uninhibitedly bares and shares his here, producing one of the best soul / funk albums ever. Other reviewers have got it right - this album is an all time classic and is criminally under-appreciated.If you're new to Tim Buckley's music, I'd say buy this andHappy Sad. Ignore the critics who insist that the avant-garde stuff is his best; get out of your head and into your hips and enjoy the muse being channelled by one of the greats at his best."
1,Junk,These mirrors are plastic and are not worth putting on any vehicle. There was no indication of the material that they were fabricated from in the item description.
5,Wonderful and practical information!,I had the chance to meet the author of this book at a recent homeschool conference and was blown away by her practical ideas! This woman is not big on ideology or theory...she gets down to the practical matters at hand. Yeah for her! You will love this book if you are looking for ways to involve your children in the real world classroom.
1,This Book Has A Christian Perspective,"It is important for buyers to know that this book has a decidedly Christian perspective, something that I did not cull from the descriptions, the reader reviews or the table of contents. There are bible quotes throughout including a whopper on page 248 ""The Bible is clear that homosexuality is a perversion. For scripture study see..."" The resources listed in the index are largely materials written by Christian groups. This book was not my cup of tea. For others it may certainly be what they are looking for but buyers should be aware of this book's Christian leaning."
3,The author thinks everybody is Christian...,"There are good ideas in this book. However, it is full of biblical notes which is very annoying. She should have mentioned that this is a book targeting Christians."
2,I didn't like it,"I was hoping for an education in principles, and this authors' style didn't appeal to me. Maybe it's just me.... I read self help books for fun. I quit the book after about 25% or so. Just seemed like, ""look at how neat I am! I have done all these awesome things with my kids! I should write a book!"" I was disappointed and wish I didn't buy it. I hoped to be enlightened with eye opening bits of wisdom to change my thinking just a bit, in order to raise more responsible children. I did not want a play by play description of this woman's charts and gimmicks. Been there, done that. Boring and wasted time."
2,...,"I like lemon and ginger, but it is not good when you mix both of them. I added honey in it when drunk this tea."
4,Great tea for a great price!,"I love this tea and it can run a little expensive at the grocery store so the price is very nice. That being said, drinking my way through 96 tea bags takes a little while so storage becomes a bit of an issue."
3,The Stash version tastes better,"Sometimes Yogi has the better mix, and sometimes Stash Teas has the better one.One this particular one, the Stash Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea is quite a bit better...Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea, Caffeine Free, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
1,Tastes like black pepper,I am very fond of Yogi Egyptian Licorice tea and when visiting my sister couldn't find it at the grocery store so I picked up the Lemon Ginger which has some of the same ingredients including black pepper. I tried it 3 times but just can't drink it. It tastes like someone ground pepper in my tea.
2,Doesn't keep very cold even after following instructions to the tee,"The wallet DOES keep just slightly cooler than air temperature. So, it's 85 degrees out and it's like 83 in the wallet. I followed the instructions about how long to keep the sleeve under water and I used cold water too. Another thing--you can't place this inside a sealed bag--it needs air to breathe to keep so called ""cool"". I have a waterproof case that I wanted to place it in but could not because of the instructions."
3,good but too small,"The pouch works fine, but it is way too small - after it sucks in water, the inner opening becomes too tight to fit Animas Ping pump inside. I managed to do it with some force, but my son would not be able to do it himself.Taking it out for bolus is quite problematic."
5,A tale of a holocaust survivor searching for her father.,"A fast-paced, gripping odyssey of a thirteen year old Jewish girl who survived the holocaust and is desperate to find the father she believes is still alive. The subsequent twists and turns take us on an unforgettable journey."
3,Zappindulgence,"To put it simply, ""Permanent Damage"" gives you an idea of what the Shaggs would have sounded like if they'd opted for studio musicians.Most of them can't sing (although the harmonies on ""Circular Circulation"" are rather nice), their lyrical capabilities are fair at best, but you can tell they had a ball making the album.All but two of the GTOs are dead at this writing, so don't be looking for a reunion tour!If you're a Zappa completist, you'll definitely want to pick this up. If you're just curious, try to find a copy at a price you won't mind paying. Or have somebody loan it to you.TT"
4,"Soothing, relaxing music","If you like the Baroque period, this CD will fit nicely into your collection. Leclair (called the ""French Corelli"") wasn't as prolific as some of his more famous contemporaries, but the music he produced was popular while he was still alive. The London Baroque (2 violins, cello, and clavichord) does a very good job of catching both the French and Italian aspects of this blended set of sonatas. This is a CD that you can put on as background music that won't bore you. That being said, I think anything you can put on as background music isn't worthy of five full stars - the greatest music compels you to listen to it."
5,Our family loves it,"This is our preshool teachers favorite book. We loved it from the moment the childrens librarian came to the school to read it. The illustrations are wonderful they remind me of the illustrations I remember from my childhood books. My sons favorite page is where Sally has HAD it with the doctor fussing over her so she knocks over the chair and makes a run for it out the door,down the hall and to the beach. I'm sure he can relate to wanting to run away when everyone is fussing over him."
4,Larry boy keeps my little one entertained!,I love these Veggie Tales movies. They are so wholesome unlike most animated/cartoon movies for kids. My child adores watching these silly vegetables singing and goofing around. And it always has a Christian-based plot. Love them!
1,Naked in a desert,"Lucy Summers' books has nice photographs in her book, great looking cover, spells and tricks for the master witch??....A real witch knows these are books to please the mass market, the Buffy and Charmed fan teenagers. They are cheap, more photos than text and (all) about love, hate, anger,luck, doing a little ritual and money.So do you really need a spell? Why don't you write it yourself? It be far more effective, but remember the rule of three. And the above are things that you can't master, love, money and heath will come if someone sees in your heart how true you are.A witch can practice magic naked in a desert. He or She doesn't need a pre-made spell that has hard-to-find ingredients.If you like spells, read Larie Cabot or Starhawk. They know a least what they are talking about."
2,Packing Issues,I ordered this product and the way it is packaged causes the bulb to break during shipping. The first one came in and the bulb was broken. I ordered a new bulb and the bulb was fine purchased on it's own but not with the unit. The unit was also defective and wouldn't turn on with the new bulb. Amazon quickly replaced it with a new one. Same issue the bulb was broken when I got it but the unit did turn on and work so my replacement bulb was fine. I problably wouldn't purchase this again as the bulbs don't last that long and need to be repalced after only a few parties.
3,Thoughts...,"Excellent movie! I love VeggieTales! However, I've had a hard time playing the DVDs. I didn't nick them; they came that way. Perhaps it could be my DVD player, but then again, I think my other DVDs work."
1,Not happy about product,"Not what I expected. Very old smelling, thick lotion. would not order again!!!!"
4,A HISTORY LESSON ON BOSTON POLITICS!,"My parents had their wedding reception here! Gorgeous, trendy......and a firetrap - that was the Cocoanut Grove. A great look back at an earlier day in Boston. Great reading!"
4,This book influenced my thinking in many ways,"After reading this book, I happened to visit a nightclub while on vacation which was jammed and I could not see too many exits. The story of the Cocoanut Grove fire and its comparison with the fire at the nightclub in Rhode Island a few years ago prompted me to get out of the nightclub as soon as possible. After my vacation, I heard about the tragedy at the nightclub in Brazil; again, this book came to mind."
2,Not As good As Paul Benzequin's book About the Same Subject,"I was not satisfied with this book after having read Paul Benzequin's book about the same subject. More time is spenton the court trial of the owners than necesary. Very little time is spent on the treatment and identification of the victims. What about Dotty Myles, Shirley Freeman and Jacob Slate to name three of the victims that were treated in hospitals? What about the index card system that volunteers set up to help identify victims that were mentioned in Mr. Benzequins book?If someone wants to choose between Mr. Benequin's book about the fire and this book they should read Mr. Benzequin's book!"
3,"Yes, but...","I really don't want to be unfair with this record.I'm listening to it when writing.There is a persistent feeling all along different piecesthat only when bandoneon is playing it succeed to hook my attention.Orchestral interventions are somehow ( I'm looking for the correct word here...) dull,unsensitive to te main character of this extremely sensitive music.I'm very disappointed not to find in this record what Piazzolla music bring to me.Pehaps I will have to listen to this a little more.But I'm convinced that first impression is most of the times the right one..."
4,The science of boxing without the commonplace commentary on violence.,"Takes you into Archie Moore's training camp and to Rocky Marciano's greatest fights. When it's good, it's very good. Study of the science of boxing without the commonplace commentary on violence."
4,sports writing as it should be,"Liebling's style personifies a lost skill..the ability to describe a sporting event without hyperbole and the intrusion of the writer. His choice of words and keen ear for the vernacular transport the reader to the actual events, which took place over fifty years ago! I suspect that Hemingway would appreciate the acute powers of observation and unsentimental humour."
2,Glad I didn't pay MSRP!,"When I took the pots out of the box, I was all excited and happy about my shiny new stainless pots. I've used them for about a month now, and so far here are my impressions:The frying pans are not that bad, they hold the heat real well, and are a beauty to work with. I would have liked a less pronounced curve for the sides, as it's hard to have the food ""jump"" from the pan when shaking it back and forth.Like Celeste mentions in another review, I have 2 pots that leak around the handles. I haven't contacted Tefal yet, but am eager to see how the ""limited lifetime warranty"" will hold up to that, and whether the replacements will have the same problem.It's a nice stainless set, but the price is not a ""bargain"" for what it is. I'd say it's worth just that (150$) and nowhere near the MSRP."
3,The Gospel WuTang,"L.A.

4,lasymphony.com,"It's funny, it's thought-provoking and it's just freakin good hip hop. The Symph knows how to make good hip hop; they've been at it for a while and you can tell from this CD. Check out their website and Pigeon John's CD... then you'll have seen some of the best things hip hop has to offer- Christian or not."
4,Best of Tim's R&B offerings,"As an avid Buckley fan and a lover of funk and soul, I can't help but love this album. Dolphins is gorgeous."
3,Hit and Miss on Sefronia; genius of Buckley still conveyed,"Tim Buckley's phenomenal range is displayed on this sometimes mediocre, sometimes stunning album. ""Dolphins"" is an incredible cover that was one of Buckley's favorites in concert; the rest is a mixed bag distorted by overproduction and an abysmal backing band (complete with female singers!). ""Honeyman"" is a funky rocker but seems contrived. Few other songs are of note except the gorgeous initial ""Serfonia"" which shows Buckley's talent and superior gift for musical/lyrical ability as compared to his often unrealistically admired son. ""Sally Go 'Round the Roses"" is a nice closure to an overall average album. However, it is worth buying due to Buckley's incredible power to make even the worst song in the most cliched arrangement sound fresh and angst ridden."
4,excellent,"Don't beleive the hype. This album, near the end of Tim Buckley's too short career, gets trashed. Why? Good question.After folk,Goodbye and Hello, jazz,Happy Sadavant gaurd,Starsailor,Lorcaand funk,Greetings from L.A., Buckley made a rock and roll album.This is not his most experimental or revolartory, but his voice is in fine form and the playing is great: He is still reaching those highs with his operatic tremalo.It is not a given style that makes Buckley a master--it is the passion. He FELT his music.What more can we ask of any artist."
2,For die hard fans only,"If you love Tim's pre-starsailor works, then I am sure that you WON""T love this record... pedestrian songs, forced melody lines, pretentious background music...just like any rubbish throwaway. However, for soul-funk lovers this record shows the talent of Buckley as an incredible singer, anyway, ...but it don't save this record from being ""forgettable"". Dolphin is great, anyway, but if there is a single for this I would rather buy it..."
5,Long live the comedy of Kinison,"A friend of mine, a somber fellow who rarely laughs and almost never laughs hard, pounded the floor, cracking up as we viewed SAM KINISON LIVE. Long live the comedy of Sam Kinison!"
5,a thriller,Tom Clancy must be envious......only want to know if Harrison Ford will be in the movie? Or will Cubby Broccoli turn it intoa 007 adventure?
3,Bush couldn't get rid of Osama,More than 3 years after Osama Bin Laden and his gang attacked us we still are having to deal with his threats. We need a president who will not lose sight of our true enemies. After losing so many of our young men and women and spending so much money we are no safer than we were on 9/11!What was the point?Please vote for John Kerry.
1,Alarmist but unlikely,"There is very little real intelligence in this missive. Essentially, it's a Nash-like assembly of paranoid implications strewn in a media bent on dethroning a Republican president. The bottom line is: anyone can cash in and get $2M+ for giving the US government information that leads to a component of a nuclear bomb, let alone a full one. We also know that the Russian mafia ripped off Al Qaeda in the early 90s and didn't give them anything (but it was reported that they had). On the one hand, it's good to be vigilant. But we need to cover the bases that make sense. If Al Qaeda has a nuclear bomb and it was in the US, they wouldn't be able to keep it a secret (they know that) so they'd use it almost immediately (under 6 weeks). As for them owning 12 suitcase bombs, that's a well exaggerated figure and could only be proposed by someone infected with delusion on a Michael Moore scale."
4,"Exaggerated, but a good read","This was an incredibly disturbing book, but I'm not exactly sure how much of it is true. He claims that bin Laden acquired 48 suitcase nukes from the Chechen mafia. First of all, I have to wonder how he knows this; much of his book is based on what various people say. I didn't see any clear evidence of this though. But what makes me the most skeptical is the idea that Osama is just hoarding these weapons. If he really has a lot of nukes, why would he have bothered with crashing planes into buildings? After reading this book, however, I've realized that Osama is spending millions to acquire nukes, even if he doesn't already have them. Although I think this book exaggerates the threat a little, it does quite a good job in exposing a threat that many of us still think is nonexistent."
5,A wonderful sequel.,This story continues the sad but beautiful journey of Pei. A chinese silk worker. I love any story that takes you into someone's heart. This story does just that. Gail Tsukiyama is a wonderful writer.
2,"Great writing, poor plotting","While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book. Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out? Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book? This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point."
3,Well written story!,"I enjoyed this story and thought it was well written and interesting. It's the first time I've read one of her books. I have to say it was a bit slow, but enough to keep me interested. I wish I had read the others previously and will definitely read them now. If you enjoyed this book, you'd probably like ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" if you haven't read it already."
3,I am amazed to realize...,"this was written by the same person who wrote the Samurai's Garden. THAT was a great book. Maybe I shouldn't have said that The Language of Threads should have been in the hands of a better writer; maybe I should have said that the hands of this great writer should have crafted a better book. Was she in a hurry? Did she have too many ideas? too many agendas? I didn't read the first book, so entered with little interest in these characters, so maybe I wasn't the reader she wrote for."
4,"Simple, but hearwarming.","This is a sequel to Women of the Silk, and is consistent in writing style and interest. In this novel, Pei flees to Hong Kong ahead of the Japanese, and with the support of her sisterhood of ex silk workers establishes herself. Tsukiyama has a modest style, with simple prose, and clear cut characters. She plots well, and affirms such virtues as loyalty and kindness and strength of character without being cloying. Thus, she is able to expose the reader to terrible historical times, yet leave the reader with a very positive experience."
2,The Language of Threads: A Novel,This was a less than stellar sequal to The Women of the Silk but it did finish the story of Pei to some extent. I found the historical aspect of the novel the most interesting and the story of the women the least believable
3,A Great Conceit but NOT a Great Book,"The time is fascinating, that of the Japanese occupation of China and Hong Kong, and the character, a woman whose family put her into the life of the silk workers, could be fascinating as well. She's not. She's flat. She comes to Hong Kong, makes a life, raises an orphan, inherits another orphan, creates a business, saves a sister, and ultimately returns to her home village in mainland China...and she's still flat. Tsukiyama tells us all about Pei, but lets us feel nothing. She does things, she says things, and a catalogue of a life is listed flat on the page.(For example, in the most romantic part of the book, Pei realizes that a man is getting ready to ask her to marry her. This is the reader's first insight about the relationship. Less than a page later, she says ""no."" That's it. I've deleted none of the drama) From the pen of a better writer, this could have been a GREAT book. As it is, it's historical fiction with great unrealized potential."
3,A lack of Horror,"This isn't a mysterious film, that's for sure.Invalid Diva is tired of all her seclusion, so she takes a night nurse, Prudence.Well, once there, Prudence accidentally finds a secret. Then, she escapes and is chased about the place where she meets a girl who also wants to escape.A lack of Horror is the biggest problem with the film. I'd laugh, too, if there was just something funny to respond to."
4,A Rare Recording of a Great Oboist of the Yesteryear,"Andre Lardrot was one of the greatest oboists of the 20th century, with a beautiful singing tone and a smooth technique, and the musicality to match. Originally from Switzerland, he studied in the Paris Conservatory, winning the First Prize there, as well as in Geneva in 1956 (shared First Prize) and won the Second Prize in Munich in 1961 (behind Heinz Holliger and ahead of Maurice Bourgue). For years he was the Principal Oboe with the Salzburg Mozarteum.Andre Lardrot recorded extensively with Vanguard in the LP era, but unfortunately very few recordings have been reissued on CD. This is a rare CD featuring mostly Andre Lardrot's playing.Being an oboist myself, I can heartily recommend this CD. The quality of the recorded sound is so-so, but the playing is first-class. For an even better rendition of these pieces, with better sound, one may try Heinz Holliger or Pierre Pierlot's recording (available on DG Eloquence and Erato, respectively)."
3,Had defects,I love the table. Every piece was wrapped with plastic wrap except the table top. I suggest putting a blanket down to prevent it from being scratched as you are assembling.
5,Very nice! Beautiful Chrome Plate Bar Table and 2 Stool Set,"The table and stools are awesome, very nice. Our son will love it! Moshya Home Furnishings was very nice to work with."
5,Great product for best price I could find on Internet,"Was looking for a couple of sets of these table/bar stools and found this to be cheapest price with shipping included. No scratches on table tops and all assembly hardware packaged neatly and with easy to understand instructions. Arrived in a timely manner in well packaged boxes. (Each set is in a single box) the barstools don't swivel, which I think the description said they did, but no big deal. Great value and they look great!"
5,Doesn't foam,"This pleasant-smelling men's shampoo is, like some other Ahava products, quite dense and creamy with a mineral feel. It hardly foams at all in the shower but tends to cling like a conditioner. It rinses off completely (leaving the hair clean) and seems to condition as well--a good thing, since Ahava doesn't make a matching conditioner in the men's line."
5,Great for Men's Every Day Use,Nice clean scent. This shampoo is great for everyday use. This product lathers up wonderfully and a little goes a LONG way. I really recommend the conditioner as well.
3,I was a Male War Bride,"An Older but funny Cary Grant movie , but as always Grant being on the recieving end of the mishaps. Worth watching , not up there with his best though."
4,Government forms are the same every where,"The time, just after WWII. The place Occupied Germany. After two people that clearly dislike each other have been forced to work together, French Capt. Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) and U.S. Lt. Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) they decide the only thing the can do is get married. All this would be fine except for one thing. The U.S. government forms for bringing a spouse back to the U.S. assumes the spouse is female (hence bride.) After several attempts to correct this oversight it is apparent the there is only one way to get on board the ship. A horse is missing a tail and a lanky spouse is having problems with high heals. Will this work or is it just the beginning?There are many great one-liners. Also misinterpretations and some slapstick moments. Through all of this you get the Grant expressions. The film itself was made in 1949 in several locations in Württemberg, Germany.Operation Petticoat"
3,Not as good as other Grant comedies.,"Compared to such classics as Bringing Up Baby and Mr. Blandings Build His Dream House, Grant is not in top comedic form here. I agree with a previous reviewer that the pacing of the movie is off and lacks that true screwball energy. But it is still pleasant and fun. Be ready to suspend your disbelief, too, because Grant is about as French as Tony Blair."
2,Over-rated Cary Grant vehicle. Not one of his best.,"I know this film is supposed to be a classic, but I wasn't pleased with this purchase. The gags seemed obvious and tired. Cary seemed tired. This was really the beginning of his most lackluster period on screen. This and the films that followed (CRISIS, PEOPLE WILL TALK, ROOM FOR ONE MORE, DREAM WIFE, MONKEY BUSINESS were all pretty disappointing efforts).Ann Sheridan was better in her earlier roles at Warners. She seems wasted here."
2,I Was a Male War Bride,Not one of Cary Grant's better ones. Too goofy and it didn't look as if he enjoyed the part.
1,The worst of Grant,"This is Cary Grant's worst comedy, and one of the least funny films ever made by a major studio. The script is embarrassingly bad. The hackneyed sight gags will make you groan. If Grant in drag turns you on, perhaps you'll also enjoy him pretending to be a Frenchman. If the quarreling of two people for more than an hour excites you, then you should listen to the Bickersons. I'm tossing my copy of this dreadful movie. I wouldn't inflict this on anyone else."
2,MY GRADE: C,I gave this film a good 40 minutes and didn't find it interesting enough nor up to the usual caliber of most Cary Grant films. Yes I heard at the end that Cary Grant does a good job impersonating a female nurse but why wait for that if the film is a notch above total boredom? Humor was off as was some of the pacing in the story and some blame female lead Ann Sheridan for that one. Probably unfair as the movie just had a number of issues. This is one of those old movies that doesn't stand up to the test of time. Pass! WHEN WATCHED: mid February 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C.
5,Still the best,I enjoyed this movie even more then I did before. It's too bad that the current movie makers can't make good movies like this.
3,"Not one of Grant`s best, but worth watching","This is not one of Grant`s best romanitic comedies, but it`s worth watching. There are a few good laughs in it, but considering thatit is Howard Hawks directing and Grant in the main character, I really expected much better.The acting is decent, but not great. And some of the gags and jokes are pretty good, but the film suffers greatly from pacing andtiming problems.Watch it, it`s good for a few laughs. Just don`t expect too much from it."
4,Nothing says comedy like a man in a dress,"Cary Grant has always been one of my favorite actors: handsome, versatile, charming. Ann Sheridan is often underrated and certainly died too young. Together, they make a fairly predictable pair in a fairly predictable film. She is an officer in the peace keeping troops in France after World War II; he is a French officer who is assigned a mission in which she accompanies him. Neither like each other then (of course) fall madly in love (in a hay stack, of all places). They get married, mix ups ensue, they have to get him legally in to America but all the rules are written for war Brides (not war Husbands). Cary Grant has to get aboard the departing ship to America but can only do it if he disguises himself as a war Bride. As handsome as he is, he does not make a good looking woman! Regardless, this is a charming movie with a few laugh out loud moments. If it's on sale, buy it."
2,A let down,"I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull."
4,WB,I am a WB lover and this visual yearly movie history is beautifully done and the short movie synopsis is very educational. I would recommend to all movie lovers.
4,It's only words.,"This is the final volume in Rhino Records' extensive series covering the so-called British Invasion. This volume features songs from 1967 to 1972, with over half being from 1968. It is a good mix of big hits and obscurities. Not ever song is great, but the majority are good. Fans of British rock will enjoy it."
1,This compass Jams,"I work at a Dive store and this is our best selling compass by far since it fits the Suunto/Aqualung modules. However it frequently locks up, and then even hard blows will not allow the needle to turn. This is the second unit I have tried and both locked up. If you enjoy being lost underwater with a non-functional compass then this one is for you. Shame on Suunto!"
2,very disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book and found it very disappointing. Almost every page had 2-3 boxes with quotes in it which was very distracting. The chapter headings were inviting but there was very little detail involved in the chapter. Some chapters were only 2 pages long, enough to give a general description of the topic. Too many one-liners, like ""Either the key to our wallet is in our heart, or the key to our heart is in our wallet."" that just left me cold. Now I must admit I am a psychotherapist so much of this material I already knew, but I still consider myself a student in life as well as a teacher, and the writing just didn't connect with me. There was nothing that I felt invited me in to the topic or caught my attention that would give me something deeper to think about. It was too general. The journey to greatness was more like a journey to paying attention to your life, which of course is a great thing, but even then it just didn't fill the bill for me."
5,Succinct and thought-provoking!,"The Journey to Greatness is succinct and thought-provoking! It is filled with uplifting messages in an easy-to-find format. As a school leader, I look for quick references that can present issues of the day in perspective or inspire me to continue the work with a memorable quote. Noah benShea has managed to do both with his latest book of wisdom."
1,Way overhyped and unconvincing,"Richard Oberuc has collected together a reasonable collection of formulae, charts, tables and academic references for this book. However most of the material can be found for free on the internet and he draws little original conclusion himself. The so-called ""Dynaporte""(TM) just appears to be a classical factor model of the type that's been around for years. The book ends up feeling like a high school dissertation - pretty vacuous. For a serious read on portfolio theory try books like the classical approach of Grinold & Kahn, or more recent texts by Amenc or Scherer. Carol Alexander's ""Market Models"" also has an excellent section on factor models and lots more. Also worthy of recommendation is the 2005 text by Focardi & Fabucci ""From CAPM to Cointegration"" - superb for serious students."
3,Dora doll clothes,"While the doll fashions are a bit expensive, my granddaughter loves them! Dora is her favorite and she has really enjoyed changin g the outfits!"
