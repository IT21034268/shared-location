3,Good but not great,After listening to this disc 6 or so times I think I have a good feel for it. This album is decent/good but it just feels like its missing something. Several songs have some good break down parts but songs as a whole are just not very well done. The only other God Forbid I have is Gone Forever and that one is much better than Constitution. Doesn't even compare. Buy Gone Forever! :-)
3,Mediocre,"Though this album has plenty of great riffs,and alot of speed and intensity,the killswitch-esque vocals and lyrics drag it down immensely.Personally my favorite album was Determination,which blew me away when I 1st heard it and continues to impress me at every listen.I geuss they just dont have the determination anymore to play bad ass metal like they used too."
4,Cool Concept record`,I was very impressed with this record. The vocals are typical metalcore ( music that I love) but dallas and the boys come up with some awesome riffs. I do think this cd was better when fear factory did it remember Obsolete anyone? Plus that cd was more creative to me. Anyways this is a very strong disc and I hear the vocals fine.
2,Good Only under one condition,These guys used to be good to me...Till I heard them live. And now...they're definitely Not buff at all.
4,I'll Keep It Simple,"I've been a metal fan for 20 years, and I appreciate many different sub-genres of metal. As with most old school metal heads, I have been very resistant to this new American ""Metalcore"" movement. God Forbid is definitely metalcore. However, this album is laced with so many top-notch metal elements, and it carries the spirit of true metal all though it. Unless you are absolutely hell bent against anything even remotely metalcore, you will love this album. Some of the jams are so solid, that I would rank them up there with any band I've ever heard. At times, I find myself wishing that they would be less choppy and just play straight forward thrash/power metal, but I'm sure that will pass with more listens. It is what it is, and it is absolutely excellent real Heavy Metal, through and through. I'd give it 4.5 stars if that were and option."
5,So good....,"Its heavy, melodic, epic...everything a metalhead would ever want. If you like metal...and I mean real metal...Get it. Now."
2,"Yawn... sorry , I fell asleep. very weak.","Music almost O.K., the band was boring to watch do the music. They did not perform the songs they just played them with the house lights all on.Band had big smiley faces. I have a suspision that they might be a ""christian"" band, and we all know what thats like. Skip this band and just get you some Moody Blues, or some Yes and you'll be alot better off."
3,Ticks Too Loud,"I like the small size of this alarm clock, and the easy to read face. However it ticks TOO LOUD. I have always had analog alarm clocks on my nightstand so I am used to mild ticking while I sleep, but this one is super loud. I ended up moving it into my bathroom, and I can still hear it ticking from down the hall! I also agree with the other reviewer that the small hand doesn't quite point to the hour (at the top of the hour)--the arm setting is not very accurate."
1,very low quality,It looks like it's going to break right away. In person it looks much worse than in the picture. Very shoddy materials and worksmanship.
1,Tick - Tick - Tick,"Why would any company market an alarmclock -- ordinarly placed beside yourbed -- that is so noisy that you canhear it ticking in the next room!?Don't the product engineers at Westcloxunderstand that it is the alarm that issupposed to be noisy, not the clock allnight long!?Remind me to avoid Westclox in the future."
1,NEVER worked!,"We ordered this exact model number from a different supplier than amazon.com. We tried 3 different batteries in it, all of which tested out okay on our battery tester. Within 24 hours we realized that sometimes the second hand moves (with a moderately loud tick, by the way), and other times it just sits there and wiggles. So obviously it can't keep time. So within 24 hours we called the supplier and they agreed to credit our account. They didn't even want it sent back.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
2,arrived broken,"Arrived broken, need to send to manufacturer with $3 for S&H - doesn't seem worth it, will buy another one somewhere else."
1,Too noisy -- after a while it goes out of the room.,This watch is just too noisy -- you can't have it in your bedroom -- go for something else. Parts can also fall off.
4,Good information for Disney-only travellers,This book is fine if you are only planning to see the Disney parks. It has in-depth coverage of th 4 Disney parks plus Disney properties and sgops. But in my past couple of Orlando visits I've gone to places like Universal Studios and SeaWorld. This book covers none of that.
3,"Great pictures, but....","I really love the pictures and artwork in this book. The graphics make the read a bit more than what it really is... a sales ad for Disney.There are no reviews in this book. Everything is sugar coated to sell. The guide is designed to push the services with the highest profit margins. Yes, Disney is a business, but do you really need to pay them for the privilege of being duped?If you buy this book, make sure you also get a non-Disney publication for the real information."
5,A must-have for anyone planning a trip,"This is the quintissential WDW guidebook. Filled with detailed descriptions of every hotel, ride, show, restaurant and more, it has everything you need to know and more. With the knowledge you gain from this book you will be able to spend your vacation time having fun, rather than spending time in unnecessary lines or wasting it on silly things. This book also has a number of money saving coupons in it, and should be taken along on your trip to serve as a guide."
3,"The most current info, but slightly biased.","I felt that of several books I read, this was the most up to date of them all. Despite this, I found it to be lacking in any sort of criticism of the attractions. Certain attractions that other books seriously bashed were given glowing reviews here.Many of the photographs used in this book are available at Disney's web site. I felt slightly cheated discovering this.For a more unbiased read, I suggest ""Frommer's 99 Walt Disney World & Orlando"". Frommer's also includes a suggested age for each attraction, which I found particularly useful."
5,Good refresher,"This book, in conjunction with U.S. History II, helped me prepare for California's CSET in Social Sciences. It was easy to read, and gave me conficende to take the test, which I passed the first time around. I highly recommend!"
3,Poor design,"I have one and use it frequently since modifying it. The present(poor) design angle back which is a leverage disadvantage for the user and is very tiring. I suggest that a redesign,like my modification, makes for easier and more comfortable trimming. I bent a curve in the handle that puts the control part of the handle just above and slightly ahead of the trimmer. The technique is easy to control with pulling instead of pushing motion and makes lifting from one place to an other convenient. Thanks for the opportunity to give my opinion on the American Gardener Extension Handle. The GS48 trimmers have been very good and useful. JWC"
2,American Gardener Extension Handle,"This product does not perform the way I had hoped it would. In trying to trim along a sidewalk edge, the clipper becomes buried in the grass and drains the charge on the unit. I purchased it for my parents in hopes that it would eliminate the need for them to have to bend over to do their trimming. Doesn't function in an acceptable manner. I would not recommend this product."
4,Very good tool,"After reading the reviews, I had some reservations about ordering this tool. I went ahead and ordered it anyway.This tool is mainly to be used by my wife who has back trouble.After using the tool for the first time she was very impressed. She could do all the trimming without bending.She said the tool fit the trimmer well and was easy to use.A decent tool for a decent price.I would recommend this tool after watching it in use."
4,American Gardener SH10 Extension Handle,Works well but is not as sturdy as a previously owned Black and Decker similar product. The two piece handle does not fit tightly where the sections connect. This causes some wobble when in use. Other than that it does what we want and expected it to do.
1,Defective product shorted out shears,"I've been very happy with the grass shears and bought the extension handle DESPITE the poor reviews it was receiving. Unfortunately, I ordered it in winter and didn't actually unpack until spring, too late to return it to Amazon. The power connector was visibly misshapen and I have to straighten it out to get it to plug into the shears. I was rewarded with shears that worked. For about two minutes. Then the freshly charged shears stopped running, even without the handle. Since they will no longer take a charge or show ANY sign of life, I have to conclude the defective handle shorted out the shears. So, in addition to wasting money on the handle, I now have to buy another pair of shears. Major bummer."
1,sh10 extension handle,"I was unable to attach the american gardener to the extension handle. Consequently, the plug arrangement became squewed and the extension handle is unusable. Without ever having used the extension handle it had to be discarded."
1,BRIAN KRYSTYN,"I HAD TO GO THRU TWO HANDLES TO REALIZE THAT THEY DON'T WORK.WHEN I PLUG IN THE EXTENSION HANDLE TO THE GRASS SHEARS, THE SHEARS DON'T WORK. WHEN I DISCONNECT THE HANDLE FROM THE SHEARS, THE SHEARS WORK PERFECT. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO ""CONTACT"" OF POWER TO THE SHEARS FROM THE HANDLE. IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE PICTURE. YOU NEED IT TO WORK GOOD IN THE REAL WORLD."
3,testing the extension handle,"I purchased this handle after reviewing the poor ratings that have been previously given. Granted, the handle unit is quite flimsey and care should be used when the clipper unit is attached. But if you attached the head to the extension handle with a little care this will save you a lot of back aches. I paid around $14.00 for it and it should hold up for several seasons. I rate this handle 3 stars just because it is so flimsey and the engineering leaves a lot to be desired.Boni T."
1,"poor, poor, workmanship","My handle will not snap into the bottom to hold the shears in place. The connection is made if you hold it in place, but it won't hold on it's own. If it were made better, this would not be a problem. I didn't bother to read the reviews. That was my mistake."
2,Quality seems cheap,I am not impressed with the materials. However I have not had the right weather to use this outdoors. I hope it proves me wrong.
3,"Nicely twisted, but too long","A suicidal lemming shows up in a drainpipe before the boss's wacky wife commits suicide in the nice young couple's apartment. Things go very wrong from there. It's funny at times and a little creepy, too. The meaning is somewhat lost, but you'll enjoy the classic French meaningful looks with minimal dialogue, if you like French cinema. I had no idea Charlotte Rampling spoke French so well. She was hot back in her Woody Allen days. Too long by 30 mins, but still worth watching."
2,"I tried...oh, how I tried!","I wanted to like this book; I really did. The author was witty and the recipes she mentioned sounded yummy and easy to prepare. But if she were my next-door neighbor, I'd constantly be finding excuses not to talk with her. Her excessive whining and inexcusible self-centeredness in the face of family tragedy overshadowed everything else and left me completely disgusted with her. To sum up: this looked like a fun book to take on a long flight; instead, I left it in the airport ladies' room."
1,Rantings of a Whiiiiii---nerrrrr!,"A lover of wit and a good read, I picked up this book after reading the back cover's rave reviews. I opened ""Food and Whine"" with excitement when I read Moses is ""the Erma Bombeck of the Beltway.""I made it through fifteen pages of Moses whining about her therapist, her children, her mother, her life...until I could take her no longer. With a rolling of the eyes, I shut the book once and forever. I could go no further.Even her therapist avoids her--no wonder."
3,"The product is fine, but the product description is NOT correct","The rear padding and the tummy control is fine and the shape of the bum is nice. The product description is however misleading. It states: Fully padded in the hips and rear! There are absolutely no hip-pads in this product at all, just thin fabric. I bought the product mainly for the hip-pads, but there is absolutely no hip-padding. If you look for hip-padding you have to look elsewhere. The sizing is also a little awkward, it fits nicely around the waist, but the leg openings are too big and I think that my thighs were rather thick already."
2,Cheap looking dress,"I recently purchased an Ariel dress for the 4 year old flower girl in my daughter's wedding, to be used as something to play in. It looked quite cheap when it arrived by mail and I was sort of embarrassed to give it to her because it did look flimsy. The little girl liked the dress ok, but it was not well made and I don't think it was worth the price I paid."
2,One season too far,"Fry and Laurie are probably one of the greatest modern comedy teams. The first three seasons captured the Wodehouse spirit wonderfully. This season, the writers/director thought they were funnier than P. G. and decided to re-write his stories. The result is embarrassing and painful to watch.If you are dying for your J & W fix, re-watch one of the earlier seasons and save yourself the pain."
2,Plum must be turning in his grave!,"Unlike the first three seasons, which were nothing short of brilliant, this season seems to have lost the Wodehouse touch. The absolute low point was a madcap chase up the Empire State Building; both Bertie and Jeeves were completely out of character. I got through the set just once and re-sold it almost immediately. I highly recommend the first three sets, but if you're a Wodehouse purist, pass on this fiasco."
3,"Great content, dodgy video.","Who can argue that the content is just short of brilliant? One couldn't pick two better actors to bring Wodehouse to life. But while the ripping yarns are engaging, the production leaves a little to be desired and detracts from the experience. It looks like somebody set up an old reel to reel in a dark room, pointed a camera at the screen and burned that to DVD. Come on, we've been living with DVDs for quite a few years. Producing something of quality is what we expect from PBS, right?"
3,Oops - should have stopped after the 3rd season,"I agree with the other reviewers. I love Jeeves & Wooster. I love Fry & Laurie. But the 4th season isn't up to snuff. The writing is weak. It makes me think they ran out of Woodehouse's original stories and arrogantly thought they could pull together their own. A lot of the original cast members are gone, and their replacements just don't cut it. For example, the imposing Roderick Glossip is now a nice fuzzy guy who needs help. At least it's the same Honoria. In a lot of places I felt like I was watching a Fry & Laurie skit, rather than Jeeves & Wooster. Not that a Fry & Laurie skit is a bad thing, but it just didn't fit with Woodehouse."
3,"Very enjoyable series, although this one is not as strong.","I've greatly enjoyed Wodehouse's stories involving the Wooster and Jeeves pair. This TV series overall has been quite good, although the first two seasons are most definitely the best. This one, the fourth suffers from far too many cast changes (the characters feel like they've changed too much as well). Some quite corny script pieces, and some strange mangling of different short stories to make up an episode.Overall, I do still enjoy the series."
2,Fourth Season Shark Jumping....,"Seasons 1-3 were marvelous and Fry and Laurie do their best to save this season but there are some truly terrible episodes. Episode 2 is the worst episode ever, ending with a stupid chase up the Empire State building. This season seems to rely on ending many episodes with a final chaotic chase scene.It has a few good moments and some good dialog but it's only worth having just to say that you have the whole series. A sad end to an incredible series."
5,Troubled times calls for drastic measure,"With a well marked up price and a good brand name, iam glad I have this alarm system.-Attempted robbery is always hard to mark because the people doing the crime always find a time when were most vulnerable.My time was when I was a sleep, at 3 a.m. lucky for my dog and father who had warned me of such things were not so far to be careful of (in my own parking lot!). This is the reason why I bought the Hornet; it's both easy to use and practical. I can sleep easy knowing that the vibration sanative alarm is on and working, as well as the fact that I don't really half to go out side with a flash light and screaming about with the possible chance of getting shot..."
4,a very good game,"PC version doesn't support joypad (at least i couldn't find any way to do it), but once I get used to the control, I think it works very well. I especially like the story and the overall presentation, the graphics and music are really good. The missions are challenging, but like all games, you can always find ways to beat the AI.some things I don't like:1. game is a bit short, which can be a good thing, because:2. game got kinda repetitive toward the end, just throw more enermy at you.3. somewhat limited weapon selection"
2,Not very good & Target ripped me off,"I paid $19.99 at Target and saw it here at Target the next day for $14.99. The game is only fair. I do not like third person shooters, I prefer first person shooters.The inability to save in the middle of a game also sucks. I got through a hard sequence and got killed. To start over and go thgrough it again takes about 10 to 20 minutes just to get killed again.After playing it once or twice it is probably shelfware. Not bad if you pay $6.99 and like having your time wasted."
3,60s/70s melodic pop music,"Anyone who likes The Left Banke, Badfinger, The Raspberries, Big Star, Honeybus........ should enjoy this CD from the band Michael Brown formed after leaving The Left Banke. All of it isn't as good as the best of the above list, but the best of it is. The music on it is a bridge from 60s melodic pop music to 70s melodic rock. Personally I prefer the earlier tracks involving Michael Brown but there's something for everyone who considers the term 'pop music' to be a compliment rather than an insult."
2,Nice but weak sensor,Be warn this is a pricey unit but very nice appearance. The switches are cheap though and the sensor has NO adjustment for sensitivity.You must get about 4-5 feet before it senses anything. Not too good for security but works at this very short distance.My old one went off at over 30 feet easily.
3,review from Synthesis,"Dance enthusiasts A.R.E. Weapons resurface after disappearing from brief underground stardom in the early `00s with Free in the Streets, a collection of danceable tunes that walk a fine line between being fun, and being annoying. While Free in the Streets will make you want to shake your bon-bon (see: cheesy, yet irresistible synth riff in ""Weakest Ones""), the band seems more concerned with creating layered electro-rock songs that are friendlier to head banging than to doing the Macarena. Free in the Streets is a silly endeavor (lines like ""middle finger high in the middle of the night"" dominate the disc), but it's also a pretty fun album, and those who like a little rock when getting their groove on should give this band a listen.-Matt St. JohnSynthesis.net"
3,"Classic Belafonte voice, wonderful to sing along with.","As mentioned previously, if you had ever heard the entire concert on album you will be disappointed with this recording. They have cut out the fun stuff that went on, and a few of the more touching and difficult songs. Get the entire recording instead of this."
3,Half a loaf,WATCH OUT! This is only half of the original LP recording. Get the full version if you know and love the original. (Live at Carnegie Hall (Import)).
5,A Classic!,What's to say. This is a classic for all time. I would think that more than just 60-year-olds would like this.
5,Belafonte At His Best!,"This recording is over 45 years old, and no one has even come close to topping it!Belafonte is FINE!"
3,Este CD NO TIENE el Concierto completo!!!,En mis tiempos de adolescente traje este disco desde USA. Al verlo en Amazon lo compre rapidamente sin fijarme que este no es similar a aquel de los anos 60. Gran desilusion al ver que faltaban importantes canciones.
2,BEST SONGS OMITTED,"This ""remastered"" CD for reasons known only to its creators is lacking threeof the great songs on the original album, these being ""Take My Mother Home,"" ""La Bamba"" and ""All My Trials, Lord< Soon Be Over."" A shame that borders oncultural crime."
3,Disappointment: When the Saints Go Marching In,"Originally recorded ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" Belafonte had sung one bit of it in the old Madrigal style, which is never heard of anywhere else. In this CD it had been edited out.This version can be downloaded in MP3 format but Amazon restricts its sale to US only. The Part 2 of the CD where it came from is not available for sale.Customers in Australia not good enough?"
1,Why not originally remastered as per the LP,"I wanted to buy this Album so much untill I read the reviews which changed my mind. I remember listening to the LP when I was still growing up around 5-6 years old. My dad used to play it so often that even at that age i memorized Harry's version of Hava Nagila. Now I am 29 and my dear dad has been long gone. I was so excited to know that there was a CD on the ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" and i wanted to rekindle old memories. To know that there are many parts missing from its original LP version really saddens me as it will not be the same experience.Pleace RCA, put the entire contents of the LP with its original stereo into a CD so everyone can enjoy it as we all did in our younger years.Thank youKuhanBatu Pahat Johore West Malaysia"
2,Harry Belafonte Live in Concert,"I, too, was vastly dissatisfied with the fact that they removed 4 of my favorite songs on this concert. I know the original records by heart. Had I known that they had REMOVED songs, I wold not have bought the CD. Shame on them!!!"
2,Missing Too Much Good Stuff,"I agree with other reviewers who've said that the disc is missing too much of the original recording. I bought it used without really paying attention to the track list, unfortunately. What's there is good, but why not make it a 2-disc CD and release the whole concert? Disappointing."
2,Where's the Concert?,"Where are Miriam Makeba, Odetta, the Chad Mitchell Trio, the Belafonte Singers, and others? This was a wonderful concert with lots of supporting artists. Even with Belafonte at his best, it was the ensemble that made the concert a classic for all time. I'm afraid this pathetic release has ruined our chances of ever getting the complete work of art on CD."
5,Harry Belafonte at his best,"This is the best there is of Harry Belafonte. Recorded when his voice was at his best, the fun of the live recording as well as the wonderful choice of music make the recording fun, easy and joyful to listen to over and over and over again. My favorite album of all time."
2,NOT the full concert!!!!,"I can only blame myself, (I didn't read reviews) but I was so disappointed to find that the entire concert is not on this version. I wore out my parent's vinyl copy of this album, and knew the words and music - including the introductions and interludes - by heart. I was looking forward to sharing them with the next couple of generations. While I love the songs that are included, the experience leaves much to be desired.Ah well, I will spend the extra money for the full set, and hope the distributor is more clear in the future about the fact that this is a truncated version of the concert recording - NOT the entire concert."
3,A great album cut short,"Harry Belafonte / Belafonte at Carnegie Hall (single CD - 15 tracks): While I first fell in love with this great album through this CD, it is a fact that the FULL LP is NOT on this disc. There is now a double CD available that has the FULL LP and so this single CD version is obsolete. Get the Full 2 CD version, not this one.This is a Five Star album put on an edited Three Star single CD."
3,"Great flashlight, not so great battery","I'm deciding now whether to buy ANOTHER battery for this light (I've bought three of them in two years) or try to find an alternative. This is a killer flashlight - very, very bright and durable. But the rechargeable battery is an issue........"
4,Great other than bulb brightness.,Good product. Very reliable. I have dropped it countless times and it still works well every time. Battery life is decent. The one downside to this is the bulb. The bulb isn't the brightest but it isn't bad. I would strongly recommend buying the TerraLUX TLE-ST1 LED Upgrade Kit. It makes all the difference. Overall great flashlight though. If the bulb were a little brighter it would be 5 stars no doubt.
1,"Great, but don't drop it",Slipped out of my hand about 6 inches from concrete and it died. Bought a $18 replacement bulb (with shipping) and that lasted a split second as I watched it short out. PO'ed.
1,You've got to be kidding,$87 and change and only 125 lumens. What exactly makes it such a high price? I have purchased at least 15 lights new off of eBay for friends and I ranging from 300 lumens up to 1600 lumens with rechargeable batteries and chargers and the most expensive was still under $50. Wake up people
5,Great Flashlight,"I purchased this flashlight to replace one exactly like it that I lost. I love this flashlight! I use it on duty in law enforcement. It's small and compact, yet provides the light I need. Great flashlight and one I would highly recommend for any use."
1,NOT THE FLASHLIGHT IN PIC,"ordered this by the picture in product description, very misleading!thinking about returning it! streamlight is a very awesome light just thought it was the led one like in the picture under product description."
5,Bright and Sturdy,This is a sturdy flashlight that is well designed. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,stinger,Exactly what i wanted i just wish it came with a piggy back charger then it would of been perfect
5,"Reliable, durable flashlight","Small, super bright, durable. I've used these lights for years and give them as gifts. In near daily use I've had to change the batteries every 2 to 3 years. I've worn the rubber off the switch of one, but it is still working.I've seen Surefire lights that produce a somewhat better light, but the button placement didn't work for me. I haven't looked at one lately, so they may have changed."
4,Hand Reamers,"Excellent quality item. Many times in the past I have needed tools like these to fit small items together and had to make do, sometimes with less than satisfactory results. There is no substitute for these tools for certain jobs."
4,A few good tracks,"This album is a mixture of artists who have worked with Chip Davis in previous projects. Some of the songs are really good, some are not so good; in the ned it is worth the cost to add to the music collection the songs that are noteworthy."
3,Good Russian music CD,"The Russian folk songs are cool, well done.The techno-instrumental modern improvisationsare schlock. Sorry, I just can't get in toMannheim Steamroller, no matter how hard I try.The liner notes in Russian and English were a nicetouch."
2,Unsound Theologically,"The underlying message of this book is not in line with the True message of the gospel. While some of the message may be accurate (in part), the overall message is not. For Truth on healing I would recommend Agnes Sanford."
4,Good Purchase,Good movie and allows you to see the war from the VC perspective.Its worth adding to any library concerned with the Vietnam War.
1,Iron Triangle,"This movie absolutely sucked. It was the worst thing i had ever seen. I do not reccommend it to anyone. I watched it in an English class because we are reading ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien. I dont really like war movies, but I did really enjoy ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". This movie however, didnt make the cut. The stuff in there just wasnt good. I would give it no stars, but it says i have to give it a rating of 1-5 stars. so I will give it one, but just know that I didnt really want to."
5,LOVE THIS!!,"Seriously, if you like the feeling of a full-on jazz orchestra mixed in with a house DJ, you can do no better than this. Think St Germain but more consistently upbeat. I saw these guys at the MTL Jazzfest 2000 and I HAD to have the album, but you won't find it in most stores, only obscure DJ record shops. Fully enjoyable from track 1 through to the end. Europe's best-kept secret in the realm of jazzy house."
2,Product OK Beware the Vendor,"Zim's Crack Creme Gel works as good as the original but you won't smell like licorice when you apply it. Zim's is the only product I know of that repairs cracked skin in the dry Colorado winter. But beware the vendor if it is not being sold directly by Amazon. The shipping costs were cleverly hidden in the advertisement, and the shipping and handling costs were more than the cost of the product itself. This is just a little 2 oz tube of gel. There just isn't any reason to charge $5.00 to ship it. Next time I'll buy it someplace else, but this 2 oz tube will last me a long time."
4,Having Fun with Old-School Computing,"This book, the first of several from Tennant, was published in 1992, so it deals with a lot of computing issues before the widespread onset of Windows the WWW. I hadn't yet tapped into my inner geek at that time, but for admins and others who fondly remember the days of LANs, early network maintenance, ""killer apps"" and a host of other topics, this is for you. You can do a lot with one panel of comic space. Great for one-off photocopies to post up on the outside of your server, etc."
1,An infantile look at war.,"This is nothing more than a propaganda piece, where one side is made up entirely and exclusively of bloodthirsty, foulmouthed, and stupid villans, and the other of angelic, smart good guys. This book is so unbelievably bad that I find it difficult to believe that anyone with an ounce of sense could possibly enjoy it. There are MUCH better war novels out there. This one is a waste of time."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,We bought this for our daughter to explore the microscopic world and we could not get it to work to even start her on it. IT IS THE WORST MICROSCOPE I HAVE EVER USED. The it is near impossible for even an experienced science buff to get it focused. It will give you so much frustration and it will be a waste of money. STAY AWAY!
4,Good gift for children,"The microscope itself is worth [...]. However, the material used is steel and it is stable and solid item. Not plastic cheap toy feel. The lens was much better than I thought. It comes with sample specimens so your child can start his or her experience in less than 5 minutes after the gift is opened. Nice case let my 9 years old son to keep it in his bedroom and bring it down to kitchen counter when he uses it. Over all this was good gift."
3,The Crime of Galileo,"The author has carefully reviewed the original primary sources for the events that took place. The author painstakingly pieced together the relevant documentry evidence to produce and account of what actually happened rather than supporting one or the other side. This was very refreshing. Unfortunately, the author makes reading difficult by being verbose, using long confusing sentences and often quoting in foreign languages with out putting in a translation. Getting through the book was definately difficult, but the quality of the research made the effort worthwhile. Often an author doesn't have time to do everything necessary for a great book and must make choices of what to concentrate on. I am very glad this author's choice came down on the side of telling the story as accurately as possible."
5,Very Fast,"With USB, the hotsyncing with programs like Avant Go, are very speedy. Now you can sync on two computers with this extra cradle."
3,conventional shalin movie,With all those flying and jumping and grabbing people .. fighting with like 50 people ... crazy stuff. i saw it as I was bored to the hell and needed something to just stare at ..
5,a xena spectacular,This a soundtrack to one of the best xena episodes ever. I think that they did a really good job on the soundtrack and the episode. I recommend this to any xena fan. It is a must addition to any xena collection.
5,Emotionally Moving !,"Pros ...- Good songs chosen- Great lyrics- Wonderful selection of instruments & appropriate instruments for each song's theme- Emotionally-moving songs!Cons ...- only 9 songs on this CD :(Overall, 5/5 stars.. a GREAT buy!Xena: Warrior Princess - The Bitter Suite: A Musical Odyssey - Original Television Soundtrack"
2,Not what I expected,"This Xena Original Soundtrack is not what I expected. I thought the music would come from the TV series itself but instead all I got was an orchestration of the favorites. So far, I find the CD itself to be a bore."
2,Disturbing,"If you are a fan of this show you will probably enjoy this CD. However, as an outsider who is niether a XENA or HERCULES fan, and who merely listened to this CD because a friend asked me for an honest opinion ... I can honestly say I was not impressed. The arrangement was plodding. A few good voices but nothing exceptional. Thank you."
1,"Okay, I Listened ...","... and this is just a really, really bad CD. Actors who think they can sing ... Gods save us. Id' rather hear Xena scream ""Yiyiyiyiyi""."
4,Very Good,"I really enjoyed this CD. You can follow the story, and it is both interesting and unusual. I really enjoyed having a copy of the excotic melodies I enjoy on the show. Almost all of the original show is intact, only a few spoken lines were omitted.This CD gets better as you listen to it and understand the story better. It's rather confusing at first. I also think they should have put the reguler main theme on it. If you like Xena you will enjoy this. People who don't enjoy the warrior princess will probably find it mediocer at best unless they like exotic music."
3,I expected more from this CD,"I enjoyed the Xena episode of The Bitter Suite and was excited when I saw it available on CD. Though I like the songs/music on it, I was disappointed that it didn't include more. It lacked dialogue...if included, the CD would have been more enjoyable, especially since I found myself waiting to hear the verbal exchanges amongst the cast. I also would have liked Callisto's narrative on it. Her narration in the episode was fantastic, but absent on the CD. I have to say that I did enjoy what was on it, but felt that the CD was incomplete."
4,"Well, if you liked the episode...","While not quite the entire episode ripped to an audio file, it almost feels like it is.The tracks are more like parts of the episode between commercial breaks than broken out by individual song. That's why I didn't give it 4 stars. This sounds great so if you've seen the episode and want the music on CD, buy it.If you haven't and are thinking you are buying a song collection, this is more of a concept album that tells a story, being that it is the majority of the sound from the episode.Anyway, I think this was miles better than the Buffy musical, and it was done first. I am the master of geography."
2,Nice effort but...,"I bought this one blindly when it came out. I was really hoping to hear something that resembled the first album but was quickly disappointed to hardly hear any keyboards. The first side was just straight ahead boring guitar rock. Dance all was okay, but just didn't grab my attention. Teaser and Just got back from heaven are the best songs, the later I thought was the best. If you find this album get it, it's rare and does have some good songs. Maybe I'm being to rough, it would be hard to top Sign in Please. As with That's the stuff, get it but just don't take out a loan to get it."
2,I'm sorry..this toy was frustrating,"I have a 7 year old and he wanted this so bad. The pull down handle is hard to get down and then to fire it you have to turn these two dials that you can actually look through like binoculars. Those dials are so hard to set where they need to be set to fire. Then the firing mechanism gets stuck repeatedly.Now for the winds. WHY OH WHY can they not make them attached. They keep falling off and was really frustrating my son. I finally superglued them on.The cock pit cover never stays secure and after repeatedly putting it back on it broke.Was it worth it NO. They guy that found it for $10 got a better deal than any.Would I buy it again..NO.It is too heavy for a child to play with and ""fly"" around.It looks nice- but that is where it stops for us."
1,not so cool...,"My son was so excited to get this plane, and then totally disappointed with it- but it's not really for playing with, even though it's supposed to be a toy. It fell apart pretty much right away...."
4,The Misadventures of Salem Jack and Finnigan Reeves,"I liked the story very much. It was fast paced and interesting. The plot had lots of twists and cliff hangers. I particularly liked the use of Abe Lincoln as a supporting character. This is the Lincoln we don't hear much about, the pre-presidential guy.The book would be interesting for any lover of the ""Indiana Jones"" adventure genre but is particularly suited for boys. They will readily identify with the hijinks of the two main characters Jack and Finnigan.I will be looking for more books from this author. Could this be the beginning of a series?"
2,Not so Hot,"If you just want to hear Clarence White play guitar then get this cd. However, if you want to hear a decent country rock album with good songwriting, singing and a good overall band, then get something by the Flying Burrito Brothers or Dillard and Clark. This album is mostly covers and the lead singer is terrible. I could hardly stand to listen to him. The instrumentals are the best part of this cd."
5,Amazing!!!,This book is very insightgul and detail is very good. i reccomend for anyone who is interested in learning judo.
5,The Canon of Judo: Classic Teachings on Principles and Techniques,"This is an excellent book for any Martial Artist's library. It is right up there with ""Kodokan Judo"" as a teaching or learning manual. This is a well thought out book for the beginner, advanced student, and the Instructor. Here is the core of Judo in writting and photos!"
3,"Good, but it has an Achilles' Heel","I got the trimmer about 4 months ago. It worked great and I had no problems with it--until i got into a piece of woody plant among the weeds. The trimmer jammed, I unjammed it, and it has not worked properly since. The problem is that the drive mechanism is a strange plastic loop with an excentric cam-type drive. The plastic cam runs inside the plastic loop that rides freely in the blade and basically pushes the blade left and right. The oval plastic loop apparently got buggered just enough when it jammed that it now will not stay in place and the result is that the motor runs but the moving blade doesn't oscillate. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble figuring out how to return it, get repair work done, or anything like that so I may be stuck with a basically good device that doesn't work."
1,Packaging? NEW? Is it even possible?,"I got this for someone for a Christmas present. It arrived, open, with no factory seals. I asked for them to reship it, and the second one arrived today, open, no factory seals. Once might be an accident, but twice I have to ask what is Amazon doing here? Based on the other reviews complaining about poor quality, did they just get a load of pirated dvds or what? You'd think even the pirates would bother to try to make them look NEW."
2,Disappointing Quality,Not as good as Ocean's 11. The film must not have been recorded digitally. The image quality of this high definition bluray movie look no better than DVD. I'm not impressed at all. Just buy DVD if you really want this movie.
2,How original.........,"If you have seen Ocean's Eleven or Twelve, don't bother. Ripping off a casino is beginning to get old. Its bascially the same concept as the first ones, but with a few different problems and changed scenarios. Its a bit entertaining, and fine if you have nothing better to do, but they are beginning to run the storyline into the ground. If you're a fan of any of the superstars in this movie then it may be worth watching, but it has very little originality and got to be quite boring at times, we get it, thiefs-good, casinos-bad."
2,Disappointing,"I looked forward to seeing Ocean's Thirteen, but within ten minutes of the movie starting, I could tell it was going to be a let down. WAY too much time was spent talking about and setting up the plot. I found myself saying, ""Come on, lets get on with the movie"" several times. When the ""action"" finally started to happen, I was disappointed with that, as well. I was hoping to see something clever, with some action scenes, and fun, but this movie did not deliver. The storyline was weak. The acting wasn't good, although I did enjoy seeing Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, and Ellen Barkin. I love George Clooney, but this is definitely not his best work. Save your money and make this a rental, or just skip it all together."
1,VIVA LAS VEGAS?,"Assemble an all star cast, throw in the money, add good visual effects, and what do we have? We have a real stinker,little more than a modern day version of the classic ""The Sting"". Redford and Newman would be on the floor in stitches watching this pathetic debacle. In the first place, there are just too many people running around,and even though each player fulfills his role, the characters actually tend to distract rather than attract the viewer. Secondly, Clooney fails to step forward as the leader of this retaliatory project; instead of Superman, the audience gets Clark Kent.Pacino tries mightily to be the ""heavy"", yet things get so bad at the end that this mobster can easily be taken as a sympathetic character; certainly not what was intended.Looking for a Christmas gift for your worst enemy? You've definitely come to the right ""casino""."
2,Wait for DVD. Don't waste your money in theatre,"Just as I expected after seeing Ocean's 12. But I had to please my wife to sit throuh 2 hours of frustration. This movie really sucks big time. The story is boring and the humor is corny. When the action starts to happen, within 10 minutes the movie ends. You can rent this DVD later on when there's nothing else to watch. Thank goodness for DVD, otherwise we'll soon pay $20 for each movie, while these celebrities compete each other by getting millions of dollars for stupid films like this."
1,13 is an unlucky number,"The boys spring into action when crooked bigshot boss Willie Banks (Al Pacino) cheats Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) out of his share of a new casino. While Rueben recovers from a heart attack, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and company (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, ad nauseum) implement a far-fetched and ill-defined plan to sink the big opening.I really enjoyed the first movie and found something to appreciate in the second, as well, but this third installment is just awful from beginning to end. They use the drill that dug the Chunnel to burrow under the casino so they can simulate an earthquake? Really? Are you kidding me? And nobody notices? By the way, when the first one breaks down, they manage to come up with a second one. This is only one element of a plan that would require unlimited resources and the omnipotence of the Almighty himself to pull off. I think it was just made as an excuse for Clooney and his cool posse to pal around in Vegas for a few months. What a life!"
2,What a complete waste of talent,"Having seen the first one (Ocean 11) and found it bearable lighthearted entertainment I came across Ocean 13 on cable and gave it a chance. Of all the low ratings most seem to be unhappy with the DVD quality but finding the movie ok....As I saw it on cable I cannot comment on the DVD format but can safely say I found the movie boring, the acting uninspired and the plot far fetched and overly technical. You dont need to be 88 years old to be unable to relate to the way in which the plot is to be carried out... the main actors repeatedly admit they dont even themselves when presented to them.The movie is very slow paced and often outright boring and there is very few witty lines to cheer up us viewers. Clearly this movie was made, as most sequels are, to make 'an easy buck' which I am sure they did on our expense."
1,Good movie! Crappy DVD!,"Movie's good! But DVD sucks big time!!! I've got VHS cassettes in better quality than that DVD. At the beginning, I thought my Sony Home Theatre System(DAV HDX500) & Sony Bravia TV got totally messed up. Turned out, there's nothing wrong with the equipment - thank God! DVD's a problem!Sound (Only 2.1) & Picture Quality (Very grainy, lack of focus etc.) make that movie ""unpleasant"" to watch. Even if you have decent TV & HTS. Kind of a bad copy of a very used VHS cassette. Shame on Warner Bros. or those guys who release such poor quality DVDs. I decided to buy/rent a couple more copies and compare the quality. If they're any better, than Amazon.com should reconsider their partnership with the distributor or whoever they are, 'cause it's definitely not the product I've expected!"
1,Worst DVD Encoding I've ever seen,"The color balance on this was so bad I returned the disc, thinking that it was defective. The characters have orange skin, the contrast loses all the shadow details, and the color is so saturated that it's almost unwatchable. It was NOT this bad in the theater.I finally turned down the color on my TV by 50% to make it through the movie. This disc has the same problem on two different DVD players and two different TVs - it's the encoding, not the hardware.Skip this unless you're on a B&W; set!"
1,"Movie OK, DVD Terrible","This is the grainiest DVD I have seen in a long time. Do not buy this piece of junk. It looks like they crammed too much on a single layer DVD where they needed a dual layer. Buy the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD version, but don't buy the DVD!!! Very disappointing."
4,On the edge,"This movie was an intelligent, fun, on the edge of your seat suspense. Very well casted and acted. I love George Clooney and Brad Pitt together. One of thise movies that is Worth seeing again and again!"
3,"Good, but doesn't live up to the original","I thought this movie was better than Ocean's Twelve, but not as good as Ocean's Eleven. Sequels are never as good as the originals."
2,too over the top,"The first two were elaborate but semi-believable, the third was just too much. The obsessive request to get revenge was just exhausting. The best part was the poor hotel diamond reviewer and good ending."
2,substandard,"Don't waste your money on the HD version of Ocean's 13. It looks like some of the scenes were shot with a diffusion filter. I don't care to have my HD system look fuzzy! It was viewed on a 47"" Toshiba LCD cine pro3 & Toshiba HD DVD player. High definition-this one is not."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An improvement over the shaky second installment, Ocean's Thirteen does a reasonably good job mixing light humor and light caper; it's a pleasing-enough, forgettable film that appeals to fans of the series without offering anything substantial."
3,Ocean's Thirteen (13) Bluray Disappointment,"Good movie though not on a par with Ocean's 11. The chemistry between the characters is fantastic as ever and the mrs got her dose of eye candy which is why I bought the movie in the first place.The HD conversion really brought my experience of this movie down to the ground. The picture was grainy, colours were off leaning heavily to the red end of the spectrum. I spent half an hour checking the settings of my TV and player without any improvement.I then slipped in the Dark Night (which in hindsight I should have done right at the beginning) and got the gorgeous picture you'd expect.It seems the studio and / or distributor rushed the conversion on this one so save your money and just buy the DVD!Movie: 3.5 / 5Picture: 1 / 5Sound: 3/5"
3,Good movie. Bad picture quality.,"I enjoyed this movie in theatres and decided to buy it on Bluray since it was a very visually appealing movie. Well let me tell you, don't spend the extra money on Bluray, just buy the DVD if you like this movie. I borrowed my friends DVD to see the difference after I was very unsatisfied with my Bluray and the quality is almost identical. If you're into High-def movies like me, this isn't one to get. Spend half the money and get the same picture quality."
4,Good Movie,"""Ocean's Thirteen"" is an improvement over ""Ocean's Twelve"" but still not as good as ""Ocean's Eleven,"" but I would still recommend it to the Ocean's fan."
2,Falls flat,"Sure it looks like Clooney, Pitt and Damon are having a good time, but this one trick pony has been a rotting carcass for some time now. Nothing in this movie is believable. Willie Banks should have been on the look out for these guys the minute he thought about crossing Reuben. No way a man of Danny and Rusty's thieving statures would be able to even walk into a casino. That town doesn't play. Despite a weak plot and bad acting Ocean's 13 is nothing more than sleek man candy and I'm glad I didn't pay a dime to see it."
1,Bad picture and sound quality,This HD dvd disk has a very poor picture and sound quality. This is one disk to avoid.
3,"Satisfying Conclusion to the ""Ocean's"" Trilogy","Director Steven Soderbergh manages to erase the bad taste of ""Ocean's Twelve."" This time around, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and the gang take on slimy Al Pacino by turning the tables on his state-of-the-art Las Vegas casino. The chemistry still works and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" is colorful, lightweight fun. However, it's time for everyone to cash in their chips."
3,A Sleeper,"Thia movie was very slow, with a storyline worse than the previous two. Save it for a rainy day."
3,Not as good as the last 2 but ok.....,Was it worth the movie admission? No -- Would I rent it again? Yes -- Save your money till it comes out on DVD. Entertaining but not worth movie admission cost.
2,Horrible Blu Ray Quality,"I only buy my movies on blu-ray because I want to watch my movies with the highest possible standard of equipment available to the public market. On the blu-ray copy of Oceans's Thirteen it felt as if Rusty had lipstick on the entire length I could bare to watch; low light situations felt as if I was watching ""A Scanner Darkly"" in which the characters had this eerie cel-shaded appearance; and worst of all I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie. I only give this a two star rating for the fact that I know the story, acting, and production of this movie was well worth the money but the quality of the blu-ray was an absolute waste of a piece of plastic. Some scenes I could barely make out the characters, and some scenes look phenomenal. Absolutely embarrassing on Warner Brothers, JW Productions, Village Roadshow, or whomever was responsible for making this blu-ray."
1,DVD or Blu-Ray Defective,"I have the DVD of this movie but it was defective so I decided to replace it with a Blu-Ray copy. I guess the problems of the DVD were transferred to Blu-Ray. In the second half of the movie, it kicked me out 5 times; after that I stopped the movie. The DVD had issues such as kicking me out and then breaking up so much that I couldn't watch it. The Blu-Ray didn't break up but just kept kicking me out. I guess I will never own a copy of this movie that actually works. Blu-Ray or DVD, they both have serious problems; don't waste your money."
2,OK film but very grainy DVD,"There are lots of comments about the movie itself and I found it to be fun, more of ""Ocean's 11"" and less of ""12"" (a very good thing). My issue is with the very poor visual quality. From the beginning and throughout the movie, the on-screen presentation is very grainy, looking like a second- or third-generation copy of a videotape. I have the widescreen DVD, not HD, version. I bought this just to see the movie, not to look for a home theater demonstration disc, so my expectations were not too high. ""Ocean's 13"" quality however failed to deliver to the low bar I set for it. I watched this on a Sony 70"" Qualia 006 rear-projection HDTV, a device that is pretty unforgiving of bad source material. Suggest rather than spending the money to own this DVD that instead spend a lot less and download the film to TiVo or put it in your NetFlix rotation."
2,"Enjoyable movie, horrible quality disc!",Is it just me or has Warner Bros downgraded the quality of their DVDs? I started noticing this with such releases as OCEANS 13 and the newest HARRY POTTER. It appears they're compressing the video content on the discs more than ever making the quality almost unwatchable on a Plasma or LCD 32' or larger. Could they be doing this to push more people into buying BlueRay? That would be my only guess. This is strange considering that FOX and Paramount are making better quality/less compressed regular DVDs. I know the more extras you have on the disc the more compressed the image quality may be but this has never stopped Warner from making a decent product before (though their DVD quality has always been much lower than most other brands).
2,Why is this shipped with HD DVD player?,"I don't understand why this movie ships with the Toshiba HD DVD player. The intent of the filmaker was to give the look of a 60's era film. For someone viewing their first HD DVD - they will be extremely disappointed in the picture. I tweaked with all picture settings trying to make it look better. After a bit of research, I learned that this was the way the film was produced. Just don't let this be your first HD DVD viewing experience!"
2,"In this case, revenge tastes like week old leftovers","Everybody loves Ocean's senior member, Reuben, so when Vegas Willy Banks cheats him out of their casino partnership and causes Reuben to have a heart attack, the Ocean's team get back togetehr for revenge.This should be great. They've got another big stakes heist on a Vegas casino. Oh, and the dastardly Terry Benedict from ""Eleven"" has even joined the team because he wants to break the ""Banks"" as much as the Ocean's team does.So, why didn't it work? Too much detail and too much setup. You're wiped out by the time the real action happens and while you want to see poor old Reuben get his own back--it just doesn't seem quite worth it at the end.I'm glad I only rented this film and didn't see it at the theatre. I'd strongly suggest anyone who hasn't seen it and wants to rent ""Thirteen"" before buying it."
2,Somewhat of a mess,"I loved the first one but was confused by the second until I rewatched it a few times. Ocean's 13 is even more confusing and I have NO desire to rewatch this mess of a film. The plot is just way too ridiculous and even more far fetched than the other two films. Also, I felt that the characters didn't really work as a team as in the other films. I just didn't feel like they gave it their all, and were just in it for another paycheck.Also, I found that the actual dvd quality was terrible. One of the worst I've ever seen. It just showed up extremely dark and saturated on my 46"".There is absolutely no point in watching this film except if you like the actors in it. Other than that, the film is an utter confusing mess."
4,Ocean's 13 review,"[written: 29-7-07]Ocean's Thirteen is probably the best in the whole series.Ocean's Thirteen starts off slow and trechurous. However, the speed picks up, the plan begins, there's daring flips and turns as a man tries to get in between two fast moving elevators, the casino night opens and everything just slides along into a fun and cleverly crafted movie.All up, you're looking at a review score of 8/10. A few flaws in the beginning and end, but no movie is ever perfect. (Or I've yet to see one that is...)"
3,Somewhat entertaining,It was worth watching but I like George Clooney and Brad Pitt but it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen. It is an Ocean's movie and kinda same ole same ole thing.
4,not unlucky 13,"entertaining action film continuing the ""ocean's"" latest series. don't need another. liked matt damon in this."
3,Better than Ocean's Twelve,"This is hoping they quit at lucky 13. This entry in the Ocean's heist franchise is entertaining and mildly engaging. Ocean's Eleven being the opener of the series was, of course, the best. You would've thought that Twelve would have been the last, not being all that good. But if you like these actors and this sort of movie, you should like Thirteen. Although, farther fetched, in plot than I liked, if you are willing to go along with it, watching Al Pacino do his stuff is worth it."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY!!!!!!!!!,i am stunned at how amazingly terrible the quality was in this movie!! its not even that old! i have black and white movies from the 50s that are SERIOUSLY better quality. i dont understand!!!!!!!!!!!!! its almost as if someone transfered the VHS version to another DVD. not very pleased!
2,This franchise should be retired,"Once again, George Clooney and Brad Pitt combine to screw a Vegas casino, successfully, of course. But this whole enterprise is clearly now played out. Please don't let there be an Ocean's 14. The world does not need it."
3,3rd Installment Not So Dazzling,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching the 1st two installments of the Ocean's film series, but not this one so much. I felt like there were some good moments in this film, but felt it paled in comparison to both Ocean's 11 & 12.The overall plot for Ocean's 13 lacked a lot of the appeal, cohesiveness, tightly written plot twists and turns, and so on that made Ocean's 11 & 12 great, engaging movies to watch from start to finish."
4,One of my favorite movie triologies!,Love the Ocean's movies. Only reason for the four stars is because I think the first film is better. Amazing cast brought together for an unforgettable heist.
4,Keeps In line With the Series,"I have enjoyed the whole Oceans series. Clooney an Pitt really make the movie for me, and Casey Affleck is pretty surprising, funny guy."
1,"Unbox is junk/ripoff, avoid at all cost","1)Bought the video rental2)13mins into it, the color gets all messed up suddenly3)I shutdown and restart unbox, and the video mysteriously disappeared from the play list. All attempts to find/import failed.4)Now i need to pay again to view it.Unbox is junk, use netflix instant viewing instead, it's FREE, has most of the good tv shows(heroes, 30rock, etc..) and works flawlessly."
3,"hmmmm, could have been better!","Both Oceans 11 and 12 were fantastic and i loved them both. I expected the world from 13, but was let down. I am a HUGE fan of Eddie Izzard (from his stand up comedy and Oceans 12), however, in 13 he had the most bizarre presence. He was not even put to good use as an artist. His absence wouldnt have been noticed at all! Wasted talent. He shows up walks around, swears, thats it! Come on Steven you could have done better. It was like he was the token Brit in the movie. He is a brilliant actor, and yet you utilised his talent minimally, sad. Anyway since i have 11 and 12 i will buy 13 to complete the trilogy. But i believe as a viewer I deserve a fourth part of high calibre and humour(something missing in part 3). One and two had so much pizzaz and panache, this was a massive let down. One more to make up,what you say you,cast????"
2,BORING,"Unlike the first and second movie, this film takes forever to get to the heist. Too much talking. Too much exposition. We spend more time watching the main characters have personal conversations. And the movie's premise is primarily about revenge and loyalty which is okay but just doesn't carry the same motivational umph as a dazzling prize to be taken. Plus, the movie tried to stuff a bunch of the characters from the last two movies into this one. Is it Ocean's 100? Despite being unified by heist, the Ocean characters seem scattered and involved in their own personal agendas.Skip it."
3,The same as the other two!,This movie is good but not great. Sequels usually aren't as good as the first. The cast in this movie is outstanding. Al Pacino makes a good movie buy himself. I'd say the movie is good enough to rent. Although I bought it seeing how I bought the first and second one. It's hard not to buy a sequal if you already have the first in the series. I gave the movie a 3 star rating based on the fact that it's relayively the same as the first.
3,"Entertaining, but dull","This film hums along at an even pace, pokes fun at itself and makes sure that *we* know that *they* know that it's an on-purpose dumb caper film, an homage to various goofball '50/'60s flicks like Our Man Flynt, Mad Mad Mad World and (of course) all the Rat Pack films... It's okay... some clever bits, lots of lavish set design, many wry, detached comedic performances. Ultimately, though, it's a boring film -- there's no real suspense and the ""Mission Impossible"" mechanics are so preposterous -- and poorly explained -- that even the geek-out factor falls flat. This was mildly entertaining, but there are a lot of other, better films to watch that deliver more bang for your buck. (Axton)"
2,only commenting on Izzard,"Good movie, bad movie, it's the third one, you should know what you're getting. Anyway, I just want to say that I'm guessing Eddie Izzard originally had a much larger part & it ended up edited out for time to allow for more Clooney/Pitt face. Too bad because I think they really missed an opportunity to unleash the magic of Izzard. LOL He's brilliant & I wish more Americans knew about him & his unbelievably charismatic intelligent humor. I don't care if he's wearing men's clothing or dressed as executive transvestite, he's hot in a way that Clooney/Pitt are, how do you say, not. AND bonus, he's not just a pretty face like Pitt (hello, has he ever been good in anything? Comment & let me know), he can actually act. How about Clooney/Izzard for 14???"
2,I hate this movie,"Watching this was a painful experience. Pachino, who has crossed over into ""greatness"" in which his art suffocates his entertainment value (like Jack Nicholson)actually gave his most entertaining effort in quite some time. The story line was stupid beyond belief, the action was slow and jerky, and I wanted my $3 back."
4,Oceans 13,"This was the first time I had used unbox with my Tivo. After reading some of the reviews about how it didn't work, I was holding my breath. But the download was perfect and I enjoyed the show. You do have to pay attention to the beginning."
3,"Decent movie, worst DVD transfer ever!","Ocean's Thirteen is a decent enough movie, with the same trademark twists and turns expected from the previous releases in the series. We've certainly come to enjoy cheering for the bad guys ripping off another bad guys. But in this case the extremely poor transfer from film to DVD ruins the experience. This is, without a doubt, the worst DVD transfer I have seen. The picture is absolutely full of noise, overexaggerated colors, edge distortion, you name it, it seems to be here. Dark colors, which are prevalent throughout, are the worst. Let's hope that this movie gets retransferred and reissued, because right now it is virtually unwatchable without distraction. I'd almost prefer to watch it on VHS."
3,"Great Movie, but .....","It was wonderful renting and watching the movie without leaving the house (especially for a price of $1.99), but the Tivo rental download does not include any of the extras. This is the first time we used Amazon Unboxed, so I don't know if this is standard, but we were disapointed. We especially like the subtitles, so we don't miss anything and they were not availabe. None of the extras were. So I will end up purchaseing the DVD after all to get the full product."
2,HD side looks the same as the DVD side.,The quality of the HD on the disc that I got was no better than the DVD copy on the other side. I really can't tell the difference. Really disappointing.
2,Go rent before buying this !,"Even thought this film pretty new release this year, but the transfer is very bad in many scene especially in dark, the scene on the elevator is probably the worst scene i see in blu-ray full of grains and a lot of inconnect color display. The sound is bad, are they kidding me no PCM or HD audio instead of crap dvd audio dolby 5.1 This is major film, how can they be lazy with the transfer."
2,Unbox Worked Fine; Movie Not So Great,"I'm pleased to say that Unbox worked perfectly fine for me. With Comcast High Speed Cable, I was able to download the movie in under 30 minutes. Not bad.The movie itself, however, was only so-so. Definitely the worst out of the three Ocean movies. Why? This one had the least amount of conflict. They were able to pull off the job too easily. No real surprises here. The plot was rushed and no different than the previous two Ocean movies. It was almost like watching a rerun. Wouldn't recommend it, even at $1.99 for a rental."
3,"BluRay Transfer Ruins ""HD"" Movie","This mini review is to inform you the transfer of this movie to BluRay stinks. It isn't because you recieved a bad copy or a flawed transfer, this is actually the directors intent. The film is grainy, colors are awkward and overall gives you the impression you are watching a standard DVD which you paid a premium for to watch in high definition. This is true for both BluRay & HD-DVD formats of this movie.The movie itself is entertaining and you should enjoy it if you are a fan of the last two movies. If you didnt like the previous ones, you probably wont like this one as it is more of the same.I would recommend the movie, but with the warning to BluRay/HDDVD owners to make sure they are aware of what they are getting picture wise... this is definetly not the movie to show off your high definition setup."
3,Breezy fun,"Breezy summer fun, very watchable and very forgettable. Much better than 'Oceans 12', which I thought sucked, this is closer to the carefree 'Oceans 11'. Plus I'd much rather have Ellen Barkin in the movie, who is way hotter than Julia Roberts! (I never did understand Julia's appeal...)"
4,They're back. . . . .,"If you like watching two of the coolest guys in the Western world running around having a good time for a couple of hours, this movie is for you! The daring duo of George Clooney and Brad Pitt team up for a third time to destroy the business of a bad guy who bilked their friend out of his half interest in the glitziest hotel on the Strip. Ocean's 13 has more movie magic than ever--my term for impossible feats that seem absurdly easy to pull off or plot points that don't make sense--but no one should care. Somehow these wildly successful movies work their charm without sex, abusive language or violence. One can quibble with whether it's better or worse than 12--but who really cares? These movies are just good fun--period."
1,Is That A DVD or A Copy Of A Video CD ?,I just saw 7 min from the film and i dout that its orignal!!( beyond Horrible )
3,Huh!,"I rented this movie but it said that I already downloaded it, in which I didn't so I couldn't watch it."
1,HD DVD,"SCAMMER! I received the DVD's and they were clearly opened and had been resealed. The writing was even slanted and it was obvious these were knock off's and or already opened. I contacted the seller, he told me to return the items and he'd return the purchase price MINUS the shipping, which was about twice the price of the items.I did that, with USPS delivery confirmation. He then avoided me for OVER A MONTH and NEVER REFUNDED ME! So I was out the items, shipping, and return shipping out of my pocket! Thankfully Amazon reimbursed me for the purchase price plus shipping but BEWARE! This was my worst experience on Amazon, Ebay, you name it."
5,Favorite book from my childhood,"I was glad to find a source to purchase this book, which is perhaps my favorite from my own childhood. It's possibly not a politically correct book, but it's a fun simple story centered around the creativity of christina!"
5,A favorite from childhood!,"This is one of my favorite books from my childhood! Now that I have children, I began searching for it (couldn't remember the title...just the storyline). I was so excited to find it on Amazon.com and can't wait to get it and read it to my little girl and boy. I was amazed to read several reviews that it was a childhood favorite of many other people as well. This is a fun, creative, imaginative book that will stick with your kids for years to come!"
4,Cute,"This is a cute book. My 4 year old really enjoys it. The younger kids like it too, but sometimes get a little bit bored."
2,these 2 stars go to her true ''stars'',"and they cant sing.they got her the contract and legion of male fans who would having nothing to do with her if not for her true ''stars''.those stars also got her the part as Daisy Duke in the upcoming Dukes Of Hazzard.of course her first(and most likely last)acting role was won solely due to her ''real stars''.does anyone think dame jess is worthy of a role that didnt exploit her true stars?!?!?!?she doesnt have the worst voice(bob dylan,her sister,rob thomas,stevie nicks,janis joplin,bruce springsteen,macy grey,thom yorks biggest fan-the lead singer from coldplay,the list is long)and her true stars are quite nice.so she isnt a complete waste.but how can even her biggest fan claim that she has a good voice?!?!?!?!saying its not the worst is the best,most honest complement she deserves.now if she were to ever cover up her true stars,then she would lose fans by the bunchfull.hey,at least they are godgiven stars,right?!?!?!?!?!?"
2,Could be better,"This album has a few ups but more downs. I give it 3 stars because of the incredible voice she has. But the song writing needs alot of work. I have never been a fan of remakes. Some songs should be left alone. Take my breath away was a huge hit back in the day. Leave it alone. If an artist today wants to remake a song. Then do one that did poorly and make some sort of positive out of it. Overall the album was predictable, but her voice has incredible range and I give her 5 stars on just that.Anyone here knows who originally sang the song Angels? I think it is from the early 90's. Some help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
2,Ahhh.......No.......Didn't like it,"There's something about her voice I just don't like. I can't figure out what...maybe it's that her voice sounds....like she's whining? I'm sorry. I bought the album, listened to it twice and haven't touched it since. Don't bother."
1,Worst of the worst!,"This is by far the worst pop music has to offer right now. It's chalk full of cheesy lyrics, horrible vocals, and cheap production. There's literally nothing to like on this album. Once her show is off the air, her career will be dead. Mark my words!"
1,"""Take My Breath Away""","Good, Then you can die. I can't stand her. Stop Breathing. Stop Living. You're a skinny Evil B/*-+ with no meat on your bones and you need to be destroyed!!!!! Skinny B----es Are EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A album with no meaning at all...,"These songs on this album have no substance at all they have no meaning the lyrics are poor with cheep sayings,and so on...This women may have a decent voice but with awful song quality's this album has nothing worth to it."
1,CRAP IN PLASTIC!!!!!!!,WHAT MORE DO WE HAVE TO ENDURE UNTIL THIS TALENTLESS CHICK GOES AWAY FOR GOOD!?! I'VE NEVER HEARD SUCH HORRIBLE SONGS IN MY LIFE! IT AMAZES ME THAT PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY PAY TO TORTURE THEIR EAR DRUMS WITH EXCESSIVE SCREAMING AND MOANING!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS AND THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE ALONG WITH HER PATHETIC CAREER AND TV SHOW!!!
3,Bad...but Good,"Some songs of this CD is really stupid!!! Either the songs are really stupid or the songs are really good. I song I deceit the most is the first song ""Angels""! That song is soo slow and weird in a way. But the songs...""In This Skin"", ""With You (Acoustic Verison)"", ""Loving You"", ""With You"", ""Take My Breath Away"", and ""Sweetest Sin"" are very good. The rest are just weird. Once you hear the first two seconds of the other ones you'll turn the song like crazy. So, I'd give this CD three stars. I'm not a big Jessica Simpson fan, though she sings amazing."
1,Take my breath away........cause Im dying when I hear it!,"So she is cute and pretty and all. She does have a good voice, a naturally god given talent. But she is ruining one of my favorite songs.I cant beleive that a song she likes she dishonors by singing such an awful version of. I am of course talking about ""Take my breath away"".The origional version is great and stands the test of time.Everytime I hear Jessica's version I have to mute the volume or change the channel. I just cant take it.Make her stop!"
1,No Stars? No Talent.... This has got to be a joke!,"After listening to this album and watching several Jessica Simpson videos... I just can't believe what I'm seeing or hearing. This woman has NO talent whatsoever! If you're unable to dance, you should at least have something respectable to lipsync to as you writhe around in front of the camera. Why do Jessica and Asslee Simpson have a fan base? I'm really frightened for the youth of today."
4,Go Jessica,"You know how Jessica Simpson is always acting dumb and blonde on TV but when she sings, she can sing!! Just because she is a very blonde on TV.. Doesn't mean she is dumb at singing too. Most people pay her just to be dumb and blonde. She also makes a very cute couple with Nick Lachey. I like her album and all but some times I think that she be dragging her voice on some songs or just forcing it out but my most favorite some that she sang is ""Angles"" ""Forbidden Fruit"" ""Sweetest Sin"" ""With You"" ""Take my Breath Away"". Those songs just blew me away I just loved them they are my most favorite songs from the album."
3,"the best of her albums, but it needs some work...","i have been a jesica fan for so long and i had listened to all her albums, and this one is the best so far. i like it that jessica's music gets mature and she's not competing anymore against the likes of Britney, Cristina and Mandy Moore. her tracks in the album are ok, but as her songs went on, it's kinda like the hearing the same thing over and over that it gets boring. she has to work on her way of singing more and make songs that are catchy to the public."
3,Enjoyable,I for one enjoy this cd. Jessica has a great voice. I do find myself singing along when i play the cd. I think it's going to be a great edition to any fan of Jessica. I look forward to Jessica putting out another cd.My favorites on this cdWith you(especially the acoustic which i personally think displays what a great voice Jessica has)I have loved youIn this skinBei for one never cared for the song Take my breath away but id o happen to like Jessica's version.Should you buy this?If your a major fan of Jessica's and want to add it to your collection then the answer is a simple one Yes
5,Jessica is Amazing,"Jessica IS an amazing performer. She is also a very good role model, and I look up to her and respect her very much for making it public that she was waiting until she was married. The songs definately express her emotions and her voice is wonderful. All of you who hate on Jessica are just Jealous! She is gorgeous and extrememly talented."
1,jessica simpson new album,jessica new album in this skin is sad and depressing and sad all its is about the stupid love mess about her and nick but it to have a few good songs like a sad song about like in a song called in this skin i give out a good message
1,so disappointing....,"I have seen alot of Jessica Simpson lately...Newlyweds..Buffalo Wings...and was curious of her singing talents...No longer curious I have got to warn others away... The release of this cd is disappointing to say the least. The remake of ""Take My Breath Away"" almost drove me to tears it was so awful.She should stick with her reality show. Less singing, more blonde thoughts."
1,Disgusting pap!,"She has slaughtered Berlin's song Take My Breath Away, butchered Robbie Williams's Angels and the rest is all dire rubbish. She should be ashamed of herself, money grabbing fool! She is a shambles and i hope her recording career ends here. Garbage."
1,Repulsive!!,Every song on this CD makes me want to vomit profusely!! It's truly redefines the word AWUL!!! Save your money and buy something that actually has some redeeming value!! This is just a pathetic excuse to make more money and rip off buyers!
2,Vile excrement,"Wherein Ms. Simpson doesn't sing particularly well. Neither are these songs very good, and she certainly doesn't show the ability to inhabit the songs to bring out any addition depth or feeling. Frankly, she looks pretty good, but unless she either writes or chooses better material to record, she will remain a poor imitation of a serious artist. The ultimate triumph of image over substance."
1,El perne,Hey all...Are you guys kidding?? 5 stars for this??...One of the best jokes ever!! Pathetic music at best. Don't tell your boyfriends you like the way she SINGS or else they will break up with you.Francisco
1,"Not good,not good...","""Jessica,Jessica Simpson,where has your love gone?It's not in your music..."" Needless to say,this girl deserves nothing but the title of ""The New Dumb Blondie For The New Millennium""."
5,EXCELLENT CD!!!,"I've had this CD for a few weeks now and it just keeps getting better. One of the most beautiful and moving songs I've ever heard is #8 ""You Don't Have Let Go."" I cry almost every time I listen to it. Simply amazing. Don't judge a book by its cover, stop and give this CD a listen. Buy it, it's worth it.My Favorites:#8 You Don't Have To Let Go#10 In This Skin#2 With You#5 Forbidden Fruit#11 Be#7 Underneath#1 Sweetest SinJessica, believe in yourself. Your star deserves to shine."
1,HUGE MISTAKE BLONDIE!!,"this woman ruined some great songs here ladies and gentlemen!!What's up with the re-make of Angels? (Robbie Williams' song) HE sings it so beautifully and jessica just came right along and decided to shout the lyrics out practically! This woman killed my song like BADLY...I think GOD sent her the wrong message really. Now another song, Take My Breath Away (I forgot the original singer) nonetheless IT IS A BEAUTIFUL song til jessica got her hands on it. REALLY THIS WOMAN JUST SUX AT DOING COVERS OF OTHER ARTISTS' SONGS...someone in another review said she tried her best to make this album but really it isnt hard ruining a song and it sure doesnt take that long really. I still say GOD gave her the wrong message im sure GOD is telling her not to sing anymore after this album!!"
1,One star is too much,"Bland-pop, with most liked songs being cover versions.Buy the originals, because Miss Simpson simply doesn't do them any credit whatsoever. She oughta be jailed for the mutilation of Robbie Williams' 'Angels'"
1,I have gone from hating to loathing Jessica Simpson after this album,"I heard this whole album at a party and was horrified. If I ever see Jessica Simpson in public, I will scratch her eyes out and tear out every single strand of that crappy colored hair for taking one of the best love songs and butchering it up and making it into a pop song! Her other songs are boring and nothing but a chance to show off her range which sucks and sounds pathetic when compared to Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera! If I had the choice I would have given this album NO STARS! Ashlee is better than Jessica, buy her album instead!"
1,Poor - Avoid This!,This is just my opinion and everyone will have different views on any type of music because it is purely subjective. However I think she is an awful singer who is trying to be Mariah Carey but isn't in the same league. Her version of Angels is truly appalling and is an insult to the Robbie Williams original. I very much like her as a person but as an artist Jessica needs to totally re-evaluate herself before she is taken seriously...
1,This is NOT music!,"Whatever you do, don't call this music! This is simply crap with a bunch of screaming over it. I can't even believe this horrible ""artist"" is experiencing success right now. The only reason is because of her idiotic TV show. Pretty soon, people are gonna grow tired of her stupid act and stop supporting her. She certainly doesn't have the music or talent to back her up. The only thing she's doing right now is acting stupid and ruining a bunch of beautiful songs from other artists. Do NOT buy this piece of crap that's being passed off as music. You'll highly regret wasting your money on this atrocity!"
2,"Jessica's ""sexy"" sound doesn't sell.","Alright, I miss the ""Pop Princess"" Jessica Simpson. I say this because her newest project is far from that. Instead we find Jessica barely singing and instead whiserping on almost all the tracks. On top of this I can stand that a mojority of the album is filled with breathy ballads that capitalize on Simpson's lustiness and not her voice. Overall, very disappointing to see another artist sell out."
3,The first release is better,"I don`t have nothing against Jessica, I think she is an excellent singer, but what she did to Take My Breath Away and especially Angels is unforgivable. If anybody knows the original Angels as sung by Robbie Williams you know what I`m talking about. She just seems to be trying to hard and it comes out completely wrong. The rest of the album is ok, but this second release could have been avoided. Those covers don`t do her any good. But on the other hand her other singles Sweetest Sin and With You show that she can sing quality songs as well. Perhaps she should concentrate on her own material and stay away from covers or at least try to keep up with the orginal when covering a song. But if you like pop music this is not a bad buy."
4,Good Album,"Well first this is a Mexican Import, and well, this album is good very good, better than ""Irresistible"" and a lot better that ""Sweet Kisses"" it's a shame . she is successfull now, only beacause of a TV Show and not for her Great, Great VOICE! she is fantastic and i hope more success to come!"
5,Showing more 'Skin',This expanded edition is a beautiful compilation. For this edition I will just review the 3 new songs.Angels: Originally done by Robbie Williams. Jessica's vocals shine spectacularly on this rendition. Beautiful tuneTake My Breath Away: Great Version of Berlin's hit. Beautiful vocals and up beat melodyWith You (Acoustic): I almost like this better than the original but probably because I've heard the original so much by now. Beautiful melody and vocals.Great album. One of the best of the year!
3,Jessica's CD,"I thought that the CD was supposed to be really good, and so i bought it. Jessica does have excellent talent as a singer, but her strong suit are soft ballads and pop tunes. However, because everyone has different opinions for music, i would suggest borrowing it and listening to it before buying because $14 is a fair amount of money to spend on anything.I would not rate this as &quot;really good&quot; as most media affiliates and critics are saying. Her first two CDs are much, much better."
2,Poor Jessica,"I think Jessica Simpson is a great singer, but she's yet to surprise me. I own her previous two albums and I have not yet liked not even half the tracks on it. She needs to team up with better writers and producers because though she has the talent, the music doesn't do her justice.""In this skin"" is not at all what I expected, the music has all the same feel to it, and it's just not appealing to me."
1,souless.....,"This album is awful, all those songs are really plain just like her. This album just prove that now the music companies are only interested in making big $, but not good music."
5,Not the Best Singer,Okay she is no Mariah Carey(although often compared to her. Jessica doesn't song write as well as her.)She has Britney Spears appeal (although not as good as her.)Not as smart as Mandy Moore (wow it's a pattern) and doesn't have good voice compared to Christina Aguilera. She is average at all of them making her not have something that makes her the best. She does have the best realtiy show out of all of them. She is good at the moment as she is playing her cards well. Good for you Jessica Simpson.
3,Jessica in Her Skin,"I like the cd, I don't love it. ""Sweetest Sin"" is so obviously about sex, but the best songs are With you, Forbidden Fruit and My Way Home."
3,Not Bad,"I personally think that Jessica Simpson can't really sing. She has ability but it seems like she needs vocal training. When she gets loud in a song she ends up screaming which ends up being annoying like at the end of Angels. She messed up a potentially good song. Overall the album is not bad but it isn't all that either. The songs I like the most are Take My Breath Away, Underneath, I have loved u, U don't have to let go(best song on the album) and Be the others are o.k"
3,Third time not a charm,"Jessica is an amazing vocalist and personality to watch. She is beautiful, amazingly talented, funny, and has every great quality going for her. So what if she is a little ditzy every now and then? We have a little piece of 'Jessica' in us all!Having owned her first two albums for quite some time (""Sweet Kisses"" and ""Irresistable"") I had high hopes for ""In This Skin."" While it did indeed deliever some good music and vocal ability from Jessica, it didn't have that special punch that ""Irresistable"" had. ""In This Skin"" is filled with a bunch of mediocre sappy love songs. If Jessica's voice did not shine through, this album would probably be quickly forgotten.They were smart to add on ""Take My Breathe Away"" as it is one of the stronger tracks on the album. ""With You"" is another highlight (one of the biggest of 2004).Hopefully the 4th album from Jessica will be the leauge of her first two albums."
1,I wouldn't waste your time!!!!!!!!,"Jessica Simpson can't sing, end of story. There is no denying that she is a beautiful girl however, she has no talent. I wouldn't waste my time with buying this album. If you want real talent please buy Kelly Clarkson's new album, that girl actually has talent and will be around alot longer then Jessica Simspon."
4,She is not as dumb as she sounds,"For someone as ditsy as her, her sound is very soothing and upbeat. The album is catchy, another run-of-the-mill female popstar.*yawn* looking for the next liz phair...other than her lack of flexibility from her labeled look and sound, it's alright. Songs like Sweetest Sin, is a perfect example of her maturing and trying to make it out of her as best as possible. What can I say, nice job?"
2,Very Forgettable Songs,"She is the best OVERsinger I've ever seen. And I thought Mariah Carey's post-1995 nosedive of a career was the best oversinger, but I stand corrected. I liked a couple of her early singles, but I see nothing here worth listening too. She has a great voice, but really has no feel for how to vocally style or phrase a song lyric. I do like her show though."
1,Just not good,"Haters....""Just because you don't like someones music...What gives you the right to insult the person""? Well said....Thats why I wonder why Jessica feels she has the right to insult other artists in the public eye! After listening to this...NO RIGHT AT ALL! Hopefully her looks will continue to carry her through, because this kind of music won't."
1,The radio,"Here's what my day is like when I listen to the radio::::alarm clock goes off::: ""I could say anything crazy"" :::music dies down::: YOUR LISTENING TO THE HOTTEST POP AROUND, THAT WAS JESSICA SIMPSON WITH ""WITH YOU"":::I change station::: Alright when we come back we'll have Jessica Simpson's ""With You"" on Modern Rock radio...:::I board schoolbus, bus driver turns radio on::: ""NOW I CAN BE MYSELF WITH YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"" :::I cover my ears::::::after school, I turn the radio on to a rap station and try to chill::: ""I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT, I ALMOST FORGOT WHAT IT WAS LIKE"" :::""grrrrr"":::You get the picture."
2,Thumbs Down,"Okay first off I love Jessica, she seems like she is a good person and is also great to laugh at on 'Newlyweds'. This CD however does not recieve the same praise as her. 'With You' is without a doubt the best song, 'Sweetest Sin' is pritty good, the last two ('In This Skin' and 'Be') are *alright*. The rest are not very good to say the least. 'My Way Home' is terrible, its one of those songs that you will get up to change, it is not bareable. The songs do not grow on you either, Ive had a few listens since I got this CD back on valentines day and it has not improved. 'With You' is the only track I would call great. Jessica attempts a couple of ballads on this CD, but they are not as good as the ones on Christina Aguileras 'Stripped' or 'Everytime' on Britney Spears' 'In The Zone'.It is a shame because out of all the 'pop princess' Jessica has one of the best voices, I think she just needs someone to find her better songs to sing.All in all - skip it, its not worth the money."
4,Big Improvement over First Release,"The 3 extra tracks and the different order of the songs makes a huge difference just as it did with Mandy Moore's re-release of So Real. ""Angels"" and ""Take My Breath Away"" are great songs and Jessica does them justice in her covers. The songs sound a little better in the new order. A few of the songs should have been replaced in order to put new songs on here but it's still a good cd. The only other thing i think is missing is on the dvd. I really think that her old and new music videos should have been included. All in all, it's a better compilation than the first time out."
2,eh,"There's no doubt about it, the girl has a set of pipes. She is a beautiful girl who can back it up with her voice (that much can't be said for many). However, I was really bored with this cd. If you have heard a couple of the songs, you have heard them all. If I wanted the same effect of obnoxius ballads and her love life details I would read an US Weekly while listening to a Celine Dion cd. But hey, at least she sings the boring songs with a nice strong voice."
1,This must be a joke.,This album is horrid no words can describe how horrible it is Jessica should be ashamed of releasing such crap I give this album 1 star I would give it none if possible!
1,Ummmm not good at all!,"Her past album's were so much better with vocal's and lyric's.This album looks like it was put together in a week the quality of the songs are realy not good at all plus her vocal's are realy not used on this album maybe just on the song Sweetest Sin but that's it, the rest are realy considered fillers plus Jessica should be ashamed of putting 2 singles out to the public in a row which are cover's ""Take My Breath Away"" and ""Angel's"" IMO those song's were great the way they were with the original singer singing them these are very bland and sound bad.Nothing against Jessica or anything but this album suck's if you wanna purchase something that has to do with her then get her debut album Sweet Kisses that album 100 times better then In The Skin......"
2,good lyrics?,"unless you have lived under a rock your whole life, then you should know that artist like jessica, britney, christina etc. dont write their own lyrics! so dont say that she is brilliant or her lyrics prove critics wrong, because they just sign a check and get the lyrics prepackaged for them to mindlessly reverberate to 10 year old girls who think its deep...sad."
5,A Surprise,"I have never been a real Jessica Simpson fan. I bought both of Jessica's other albums but never got hooked on them or even learned the words to all of the songs. I bought this album expecting to do the same again - play a few songs over and over, but never really get into the rest of the album. Wrong! I was pleasantly shocked by how addicted I have become to this album. Every time I try to take it out of my CD player, I only get about four songs into another CD before I want Jessica back again. I absolutely love this album and I really appreciate that Jessica collaborated on the writing of most of the tracks so I feel they are really about something. The last two songs, ""In this skin"" and ""Be"" are my favorites but there really aren't any songs that I don't like. I'm really satisfied with my decision to buy this album - it was totally worth it."
2,"Kinda weak, to be fair","I've just got a copy of this album, and I gotta say, she plays on her looks a bit too much with not enough to back it up. Fair play, she looks GREAT in her videos, and the production is slick enough, but the gulf in class between her versions of ""Take my breath away"", and especially ""Angels"", and the original versions is fairly vast.Bland pop, well produced and packeged, but absolutely nothing new, nothing standout - alright in the background, I suppose."
4,not the best,the cd ''in this skin'' ant the best thers only some good songs like1-sweetest sin2-with you3-i have loved you4-forbidden fruit5-11 are also good but still this inint a cd i love but hey what can i say she gots that wonderful vocie
1,Doody,I would rather eat doody than listen to jessica's sh*t. really shows you how dumb the people are that like George W. Shrub. But i would still do an*l on her.
1,LAME CASH IN!!,"All of the ""bonus"" songs included on this are atrocious! I've never heard anyone ruin classic songs as badly as Jessica has on this CD!! This re-release is simply a really desperate attempt to cash in on the success of Newlyweds by rushing out a re-packaged CD full of crap songs! Don't buy this, I promise you'll regret it!!"
1,10 steps backward!,This album is plain terrible. I can't believe she bothered to put it out. She took 10 steps backward from her other albums. Go buy Hillary Duff's album instead. It is much better.
4,She's pretty good,"Jessica Simpson is not bad, she's pretty and she can sing well. It's not exactly my type of music but it's enlightening. I'm not going to review track because I don't know much about her and do not want my information to be inaccurate. So please don't give me an unhelpful vote I'm just writing down what I know. ^_^Overall Grade 8/10This came along well!"
2,IN THIS SKIN.....OUT OF YOUR CD PLAYER,TO PUT IT AS NICELY AS POSSIBLE JESSICA SIMPSON'S VOCALS ARE MORE THAN LACKING THEY'RE TERRIBLE.HER CD CONSIST MOSTLY OF SCREAMING WHICH SHE INTERPRETS AS HIGH NOTES.BUT AS WITH MOST CDS YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND AT LEAST ONE SONG YOU LIKE AND ON THIS CD IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE SWEETEST SKIN AND WITH YOU BUT OTHER THAN THAT.....SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.POOR VOCALS AND LACKING LYRICS LEAD ME TO SAY DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND KEEP IN THIS SKIN OUT OF YOUR CD PLAYER
3,What happened to her voice?,"This is probably not the greatest cd i've ever purchased. actually it was really an impulsive buy .. there are songs in this album that i really wanted to check out.. i'm not totally disappointed,, I've read the other reviews from amazon and i think we can give her alittle more credit than most of these reviews.. but.. i do wonder... WHAT HAPPENED TO HER VOICE? she used to have this EXPLOSION when she sang.. seems like she has lost the power in this one.. it's more.. AIR like.. she didn't really bring out the best of her talent.. i think she really needs an album where she can use the full force of her voice in order to prove to the world that she's not just a pretty blonde hair air head.. BUT JESSICA GIRL... U GOTTA DO BETTER THAN THIS...for $14.. not totally worth it.. but o wellz.."
2,megh...,"i dunno about this cd. she sounds too much like she struggles with her singing. especially in Take my breath away. she didn't do that great of jobs on the two covers of older songs. (Angels, and Take my breath away) With You has got to be the corniest song/video i've ever heard. the rest of the cd, nothing really stands out. she just struggles with her singing and starts yelling more than singing. i think mandy moore is waay better than jessica simpson. ALTHOUGH: Jessica's song on this c.d ""I have loved you"" is an AWESOME song. and it just doesn't really fit on this cd for some reason. it's a great song. the highlight of the album in my opinion."
3,Jessica needs a little bit of old skin.,"I think this album is just average. I rated this the same as the collector's edition because it basically is. The collector's edition just has a few extra songs. I miss the old Jessica, back in the day of Sweet Kisses and Irresistible. I liked those albums a lot more. I gave this album a chance, but it's just not the same. There are a few tracks that stand out to me, but even those are nothing really unique."
3,a good easy listening CD,"""In this skin"" is the third album of Jessica Simpson and it's good. Her voice in better than in her previous CDs and she has writen 9 of the 11 tracks of this album. ""Sweetest sin"" is a sexy song and really cool to listen. ""With you"", the latest single, is an upbeat song, with a catchy chorus, in which Jessica sings how good life can be if you are a simple person, who is happy with all the things money can't buy. Another powerful track is ""You don't have to let go"". It's really beautiful and Jessica shines in this song. I like Jessica's romantic style, but I'd like to see her recording more dance/upbeat songs, such as ""With you"" and ""Irresistible"", from her second album.If you like pop music, buy this album and you won't regret."
1,Brilliant. One word to describe this artist: Brilliant.,"Oh, that's right, not only will you fans not understand my sarcasm, you probably won't even understand such big words in my title! So here, how about this:1 wurd 2 sum up Jessica: smart.she such a brainy that it reely shows in her musik. she super talent. i no cuz i seer on the tv. yep, the tv. THE tv. I said it. and i ain't ashamed of it.go Jesska!"
1,Mark My Words: A Reply To THE REALITY!,"Mark these words: Jessica Simpson, though moderately talented, is unlikely to survive much longer in this business.REPLY: SO CORRECT! THAT WAS FROM LAST YEAR, NOW ITS 2005 AND SHE IS OVER! SHE ISN'T MODERATELY TALENTED, FOR UNTALENTED! SHE ONLY STARTED CO-WRITING ON HER IN THIS SKIN FLOP AND THATS IT! SHE SO CONTROLLED THAT SHE HAD TO GET IN TO REDO SONGS BECAUSE THE COMPANY WANTED HER TO, AND THE FOLLOWER DID! THAT SONG WOULD TURN OUT TO BE ANOTHER JESSICA FLOP, SWEETEST SIN! SHES OVER...THANK YOU GOD!..WE SURE AS HELL DIDN'T LOSE A GREAT, BUT JUST ANOTHER UNTALENTED 1-HIT-WONDER FROM LIKE 5 YEARS AGO!"
3,dont buy this edition,"In this skin is an excellent cd,the songs have a really good memorable melody and jessica is clearly singing her heart out!sometimes its as if she is straining her voice for those empowerment suprano notes, do not do htis jess we know you can sing but your range isnt as good as mariahs!anyway so this cd doesnt include take my breath away or angels so buy the other one where she is half naked on the front an obvious publicity attempt to sex sex up her image when she dresses like a granny half of the time! its the blue covered one u wanna buy and u get newlywed episode clips too!this cd content is poor!***"
3,This is the In This Skin to get.,"Well, I own the original issue of In This Skin and not the collector's edition, but I have both songs ""Angels"" and ""Take My Breath Away"" covered by Jessica, and WOW! She can really butcher a song! Or two, in this case.Anyway, this album isn't really at all that strong. I'd recommend buying Jessica's previous albums ""Sweet Kisses"" and ""Irresistible"". Those two albums definitely show how she can deliver a ballad by hitting those high notes (well...she sings A LOT of ballads, but they're all good if you listen to them). The songs on In This Skin are just... well... not so good.I really do, though, love the songs ""Be"" (that's the best song on the album), ""Sweetest Sin"", ""With You"" (I liked this song before that stupid music video), and ""Loving You"".If you're interested in buying Jessica's third album, buy the Collector's Edition. You get two butc-- er.. bonus songs, and some other extra stuff with it too! I guess that's not such a bad deal for the price?.."
3,voice,"OK...maybe some of you out there don't like pop music...I know I really don't, but to those of you who said Jessica Simpson can't sing, you apparently know nothing. She has a really amazing voice...way better than britney spears, and deserves credit. Try to listen to her sing live sometime...you will be proven wrong."
1,she's a sellout and nothing like hot cakes,she had a couple good singles in 2000 and 2001 and faded away fast and since her latest music sucked and couldn't sell she paraded herself around fellow hasbeen nick on her newlyweds mess that we are bombarded with daily and it's getting on my nerves
1,mindless crap,I would'nt make my worst enemies listen to this. I have to believe that hell is a small room you cant get out of and Jessica simpsons music is playing non stop. The girl can sing and she is pretty but this is horrible.
1,"PRETTY GIRL BECOMES FAMOUS 4 NO REASON, WE HEARD IT BE4...",no no no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is TERRIBLE 4 fux sake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! compared 2 this the scooby doo soundtrack seems like a grammy-award-winning album.
1,"Uggg this album, is BORING!!!!","ugggg jessica this album is a waste of adorable time, you have no beat, no dance, etc... you should just stick to following BRITNEY AND CHRISTINA, cause you suck, honestly you do, well adios,,"
2,"Better Than ""Irresistible,"" But Still Unappealing","I like Jessica Simpson's voice, I really do. But this album lacks the umph! needed to make it a hit. When I first bought it, I only listened to her first single, ""The Sweetest Sin,"" which I though was a good leadoff song.Then I stopped. And I didn't fully listen to it until two weeks later.What I heard didn't impress me much. There were a few good efforts, but so unforgettable that I can't even remember the titles of them. I was really rooting for this to be a great comeback album, something that at least puts her in the outskirts of the stratospheres of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.But it doesn't happen.This album is full of little ditties and sappy love ballads. I kind of expected that since she married the 98 heartthrob Nick Lachey, but they were boring and didn't catch my attention.Oh, well at least she has that ""Newlyweds"" reality show to fall back on. Can someone tell me what Chicken of the Sea is again?"
1,BLAH BLAH FLOP!,"Jessica's ""in this skin"" was just another flop by the untalented kiddie star that don't do jack with her music. what do u expect...a star? nahh...just another 1-hit-wonder!"
4,Probably the one of her BEST!!!!!,"Im not gonna go into full detail about this album. But it is one of the best out of the 4 she has released so far. Thank goodness for the re-release because the 1st person i spoke to about this album was disappointed. So i decided to hold off but when i saw that she was doing a remake to ""Take My Breath Away"" and ""Angel"", that was all i needed. Jessica Simpson is talented and has an amazing voice to the likes of Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera. However she just doesn't know what to do with it. She works with the wrong people & she really needs a mainstream producer to PUT her VOICE on the MAP & Utilize it to the best of her ability. As stated this was one of her better releases and my favorite song was ""I Have Loved You"" she never released or made a video for =("
4,not taking my breathe away,"but at least she's selling more than Britney in the US , that's cool she's finally doing that. the next single will be Angels, and will be headlining her first solo tour. she has tothankfull to MTV for the rest of her life cause this album dissapeared quick from the top 100 she fell to No 127!!! and when the reissue came out at the perfect time when With You came a Top 20 hit they knew this was going to happen. the reissue debuted at No.2 (at no. 1 Norah jones just for 40,000 copies Jessica didn't took the first place) Thank god it didn't happened the same case as mandy moore who was kicked out from Epic (part of sony too) just for the bad sales of her album Coverage (it only sold 267,000 copies in the US) and now she is with Sire.. but Jessica is saved.... for the moments"
3,Decent,"I went out and bought this cd because of Take My Breath Away. I was a little disappointed b/c on the show it was sung as a duet with Nick and on the cd it's just Jessica. She did a really good job on the song, but I was just hoping for a duet. The rest of the cd is actually pretty good. I'm not a big fan of her music, but I love the show Newlyweds so I thought I would give the cd a chance. If you're a big fan of hers you would probably really like the cd. She does have a fantastic voice."
5,A+,"Her voice is not materialized. She's got a smooth voice than any guy would kill to be sung to with. I've been a fan since she first hit the music scene. Jessica is one of the best musical talents out there, and she deserves every bit of fame she has. I can't wait for the next one."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"I have never been a Jessica Simpson fan in the past. I always thought she had a nice voice but not quite the edge Britney Spears has...Therefore, after seeing a couple of episodes of her reality tv show Newlyweds, I instantly fell in love with her! I purchased this album with no expectations and was quite surprised by the quality of the music and such a beautiful packaging! It is heart felt all the way through, I definitely recommand it to anyone who is a fan of pure pop bubble gum music"
1,ANGELS IS NOT HER SONG,"on this album jessica does a cover of robbie williams ""angels"" which is terrible compared to the original which won brits ""best song of the past 25 years"" This is not her song unlike what you are lead to believe BEWARE!"
4,Good album,"Overall, this album is a very good piece of work. It's not overproduced, it just right. She is making more consist albums which means she is learning her craft. She should get producers to make awesome ballads for her like her debut single because those songs fit her so well. The Dance-Pop songs are good for the most part. With the Dance-Pop, I think she needs higher quality backing music because when given awesome music, she is equally as good at A/C ballads as she is with Dance-Pop. Her vocals are on point. She can only get better for here on out. Similar albums: Deborah Gibson-""Deborah"" and ""M.Y.O.B."", Lara Fabian-""Wonderful Life"" and Sheena Easton-""My Cherie."""
1,yeah right jessica.....,"Sorry if this upset anyone but please she's just so britney. Maybe she can sing but LOOK AT HER. She's looks and talks like britney. I don't like her that much and her songs are way too sappy for me. I've nothing against her as a person only as an singer and songwriter. Maybe she is a big of fan britney i don't know. The songs are okay only the lyrics are so stupid and boring. The music is good sometimes, okay I'm not a Jessica hater but her first album was very good. I did like a lot then her new songs are not good. Maybe if she tries a little harder next time. Some rock songs could be so cool. Thank you for your time people."
5,Yay! Go Jessica!,"Much better than the orignal release of In This Skin. The new songs are sooo beautiful. I especially love her cover of ""Take My Breath Away"". The DVD is cool with the clips from ""The Newlyweds"". Jessica Simpson has a voice that will endure, unlike a few of her other pop contempories ... Way to go!"
1,Mediocre at Best!,"I've listened to this album in its entirety a few times and I simply can't warm up to it! All of the songs are boring, with cheesy lyrics and a repetitive chorus. I was definitely expecting better, especially considering the girl has talent. Next time, she needs better material and better producers at her side. Until then, avoid this album at all costs!"
1,worst cd !,"i like her first recording "" i wanna love you forever"". but after that she become poorer on her singing career such as her not so good compare to before. on this new album, only the single ""sweetest sin"" is an okay song only. the rest is rubbish. i recommend don'buy just download her single from any mp3 website. it not worth ur money to buy this cd."
5,Wonderful Album!!,After watching the show on MTV I have come to realize just how truly amazing Jessica Simpson really is. This CD is so great and her voice is amazing. It is a great CD to listen to driving in the car and singing on the top of your lungs. It is definitely one of my favorite CD's!
5,She is awesome,I love her new sound. This is her best CD so far and I hope she is around for a long time.
1,Absoblutely DREADFUL!!,If I could give this CD a -5...I certainly would. Jessica Simpson has strayed so far off course with this CD she is hardly recognizable. When you aren't suffering through the sharp and flat notes...you have to muddle through the double tracking to disquise her less than adequate voice! An American Idol reject sounds better than Ms. Simpson on this very sub par effort. Maybe she should stick to MTV reality series and forget about singing!
2,"Best 'skin', bad content..","Angels, W/ You, Take Breath, Sweet Sin, are really outstanding singles. But if you listen this album as listener-not a fan- you'll find the songs here as the whole empty tunes and lyrics. Out of the singles the only great songs here just In This Skin and W/ You (acoustic). If you just a pop music fan, you should think (more than) twice to buy this album!P.S. by the way bonus DVD here is enough worth, especially if you like Newlyweds and only love to watch the funny scene W/out buying the First Season DVD!"
3,Re-issue isn't necessary,"I give this three stars for what the CD was before it was re-issued. The original In This Skin is an excellent listen and spends a lot of time in my CD player. That, however, is not the focus of my review.I deducted two stars from this re-issue because of Jessica's slaughtering of the two covers, Take My Breath Away and Angels. It's nothing against Jessica, it's simply the issue of not touching classics. Robbie Williams' original version of Angels is mellow, touching, and emotional. Jessica plays vocal gymnastics with it and ruins the original feel. I heartily recommend Robbie's The Ego Has Landed for the original version as well as any of his other CDs."
5,JESSICA SIMPSON ROCKS,"While Jessica may come off as another dumb blonde on her TV show, she is quite the opposite. She plays the part for the cameras and as far as CD goes, Jessica is an amazing singer. Granted this CD does not do her justice but is it her fault that her record company doesn't give her more to work with. She's grown as an artist, as a person, and I hope to hear more beautiful songs coming from her. She rocks!!!"
5,Its about time!,"I don't know what some of the people who wrote bad reviews are thinking! Jessica is one of the most sustainable younger artists..even more than Britney...she has increadible talent that makes are diva worthy! If anyone has heard this girl sing, you can't doubt that she has an amazing voice. Most of the songs on this CD are really really good, and I absolutely love it. Hopefully with the success of this album, she'll have more of a say on the song styles etc. I totally recommend this CD...I got the first 'in this skin' and the other, and it is one of my favourite right now."
1,Your joking right?,"Don't even THINK about buying this load of crap! It's not even worth $1, let alone $15. The songs are cheap, the vocals are terrible, the production is laughable, and the lyrics are as cheesier than Hilary Duff's. I made the mistake of buying this and I'm hoping you don't. Don't buy into the hype, there is absolutely no quality behind this industry joke."
1,AWFUL!!!,This chick can't sing at all! Her show is terrible as well! She is so dumb! And she looks like a transgender! STAY AWAY FROM HER!!!
1,words cant explain how much she annoys me,"Why do I dislike her music so much?1. it all sounds the same to me. All it talks about is how much in love she is. Nobody cares.2. I absolutly hate when i see her sing on tv. I dont think I have ever seen someone overexaggerate so much. I swear I dont think anyone can open their mouth as wide as she can3. How can you call this music? Its absolutly horrible.If you claim to have good taste in music, dont listen to this."
1,Stand-By! Great-Granny Mabel Simpson's Album Coming Next!,"Have you heard the buzz??? We're finally gonna' get to hear where Jessica and Ashlee learned to sing like a pair of dump trucks with blown engines! Great-Granny Mabel Simpson is currently in the studio putting the finishing touches on her new album: ""Feel Like Takin' My Teeth Out"" featuring the soon-to-be hit singles: ""Makin' Love In My Girdle,"" ""My Kids Look Like The Pool Man,"" and the mega-classic ""Talent Is Beside The Point."" If we're lucky the record company will shove this product down our throats relentlessly while putting the muzzle on thousands of more talented and deserving acts who might threaten their stockholders with a diminished profit report next quarter! Cheers!"
1,Her lyrics,"Jessica Simpson says that she feels that she has matured alot in her lyrics...I don't think so, now she sings about making love in the song Sweetest Sin,. Who really wants to listen to someone who sings about that. Thats not mature to me. Very sickening. I used to think she was a half way desent singer, but not anymore. Think about that."
1,Oh Dear! Another one of them B*/CHES around!!!!,"Personally I think this woman is way out if line compared to Christina. At least she's doing the right stuff. But this one well she's your ordinary everyday diswasher maid. Yep! I mean c'mon the album is not bad but making your marriage a selling point for money is down right a money rigging tactic. C'om have some pride for your marriage. Anyway how the album is worth for what it is. But still don't get this stupid DVD. It's just a commercialized TV show of her wedding saying ""Hi, This is my lovely husband, thanks for buying this DVD of my wedding have a great time watching my wedding"". UH oh please B*/CH!!!!! Stop this nonsense! Oh well she looks good with a blue berry pie in her face, then we'll see who's wedding is being enjoyed by. I wonder why anyone didn't throw food at her wedding?"" it would so funny to see her and her husband running around like nit-wits!!!!"
1,Apologise to Mr Williams,"When I first heard the cover version of Robbie Williams' brilliant 'Angels' on the radio I thought it was one of the DJs messing around, then i was told it was Jessica Simpson. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, it was just a truly embarassing version. If i were her I would never step foot in England, she would be booed wherever she went."
2,Great Voice: Where Else Is The Talent?,"I don't feel bad for her. She is a 1-hit-wonder and had her time...too overwhelming! I do hope this movie does well!Jessica has a great voice! She just started songwriting on ""In This Skin."" But...she does nothing else with her music and lets get company control her. I do happen to have all of Jessica's albums by the way. She is manufactured, because if you watched ""Newlyweds"" you can see that she ""had"" to go in and redo ""Sweetest Sin."" She isn't a real artist, but has potential and medocre talent. Truth be told...thats it!"
2,"Simpson...young, dumb, attractive--Possible Playmate?","I think Simpson's best bet is Playboy. She's a great Miss July. Tan, dumb, blonde, fake attributes (chest area). This album though, GARBAGE. How can I say--OVERPRODUCED! Is it live or is it Memorex? I'm showing my age here. But, really, she just gets worse and worse. Every song is some lovey-dovey crud that reminds you of her pathetic baby talk to Nick on Newlyweds. I have to wonder, who listens to this garbage?Please, shut her up, but keep on with MTV. That's some funny stuff!"
1,This CD is Horrible,Jessica Simpson got all her song material from Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. I don't know what she was thinking but she is terrible and this is a horrible horrible CD. Jessica Simpson is a b---ch!
1,"Say ""NO"" to JESSICA SIMPSON and a ""YES"" to THE WHO",JESSICA SIMPSON is the worst in the music industry after BRITNEY and ASHLEE.STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOUSY CD AND BUY THE FORTHCOMING ALBUM FROM THE WHO INSTEAD.ONE STAR.
1,1 of the worst albums of 2004!,Im very upset with Jessica she has an ok voice and should use it with decent songs not songs like this cheasy garbage!
3,Her 2nd album was the best. This one is just ok.,"I received this cd as a birthday gift. I've only listened to it for one day and I like ""Underneath"" and ""Sweetest Sin."" ""Underneath"" is a very touching ballad to Nick when she broke up w/ him the first time."
1,Yuck!!! My Skin Crawls,"when I hear Jessica sings. She has a powerful voice, but something is lacking. She doesn't grab you the way Celine or Christina does. The only reason why this cd is successful is because of her annoying reality show with her husband. The music and her vocals is NOT the reason why this cd is selling. It flopped last year and only became a success AFTER her show. And speaking of her voice, her remake of the 80s classic Berlin's Take My Breath Away was TOTALLY uncalled for!! It sounds like she is trying to do Britney. In fact, when I first heard the song I thought it was BRITNEY!! This tells me that Jessica is taking the ""dumb blonde"" thing to the extreme because now she is using that image in her songs. Jessica is milking her new media status for all its worth, but by next year her career will be done. Avoid this corny cd."
1,"Take My Breath Away is wrecked, sadly","As much as I like Ms. Simpson, Take My Breath Away was just SO overly stylized (you can just SEE her head and body jerking along with her voice) that I'd take the original version any day of the week over this one. I'm sure she didn't mean to, but she has quite simply ruined this great song here. LESS IS MORE, my dear - make that your mantra!!! Listen to the original again, then re-record and destroy every available copy of this hideously over-stylized embarrassment!"
4,A good purchase,"This is the only cd of mine that every song is good. I think jessica did an awesome job on this cd, and everyone who disagrees with me is just jelous because she is perfect. I don't really think she is great live, but on this cd i love her songs. Although i have alot of favorites songs, on this cd it's number 10, ""You don't have to let go."" I would definatley recommend this cd to anyone who asked me."
2,skin crawling,"when jessica hit the scene she was one of few strong singers... now she blends in with the others. In this skin shows her voice a more whinging and strained then the previous albums. The remakes of robbies ""angels"" and berlin's ""take my breath away"" do not add up to the original power. ""In this skin"" is a poor attempt to measure up towards christina's ""beautiful"", instead it comes across as a feel sorry for yourself kind of song. The best part of the album is the dvd. The wedding is beautiful, and jessica's personality is what saves her. Her ditzy behaviour is more preferable than her singing."
2,It was okay,I have never bought an album by Jessica Simpson so I did not know what to expect. I did buy the album because I liked the first two singles. The album was not bad but it was not great either. It was okay. I think Jessica has a very pretty voice. I just don't think the songs have that much excitement to them. I thought they could be better. But I don't think the album is bad. I will be listening to it again.
1,Only 2 songs that are worth it.,"This album was a huge let down. She is known for singing great power ballads and I wonder why she took the road to bubblegumpopdom. This album is all about her. I don't know why it's not even self titled. It's about sex, Nick, herself and her father. Jessica needs to become like her idol Celine Dion and sing more power ballads that can last for generations to come. If only she believes in herself.The only two songs that are worth it on this album are The Sweetest Sin and Underneath."
3,It's Ok....,Over Love Songs To Nick.. (I Think 7/11)I Don't Think That This Album Will SuccedSo Much.. The Most No Best Album Of Jess..01. Sweetest Sin-4/502. With You- 3/503. My Way Home-3/504. I Have Loved You-5/505. Forbidden Fruit-5/506. Everyday See You-3/507. How Could I Let You Down-5/508. You Don't Have To Let Go-5/509. Loving You-2/510. In This Skin-4/511. Be-3/5
1,NO TALENT AND NO BRAINS,"Its very sad that such a talentless person can sell so many albums. Its a sad reflection of a youth culture that has lost its way ,musically speaking. The only good thing is that this talentless no-brainer will be forgotten in a couple of years.Such music has NO WAY of lasting.The fact that she is as thick as two planks makes her chances of lasting even slimmer.Add her husband to the equation and you get ABBOTT AND COSTELLO. Give this a miss and buy some real music."
1,More like Making my Skin Crawl!!,I believe her fist album was her best work. She sings to shrilly for my taste and theres nothing really catchy about her. And after watching her new reality show even more disgusted with her.
4,In This Skin re-issued,"IN THIS SKIN, re-issued, is as good (or bad - however you see it) as the main disc. There are some great songs on this CD - pretty consistent - but I think she needs to sing more belty songs. Those are her strength. Most of the songs on this release are too low for her range. Jessica Simpson has talent, but she just needs a new manager."
1,Maybe time to do something else?,"This is her third album and also the worst. She's got married and got her own tv show aswell, so it feels like the music is not her first choise anymore, that's too bad cause i always liked her as a artist, Good voice and good songs. But on this album she tried to reach a older audience, her album might sound more personal and mature but it's not inspiring at all. Many songs sound dull and it simply don't get my attention ""Sweetest Sin"" is probably the best song but there aren't many to chose of, sad to see this happen but i hope she'll be back stronger."
2,Hmmm.....,"Okay. I've only heard 2 songs on this CD: ""Sweetest Sin"" and ""With You"", and I know it doesn't really seem fair to write a review based on those 2 particular songs, but I couldn't contain myself. ""Sweetest Sin""...um...horrid. Jessica is a stunning girl with an AMAZING voice, and it still hurts me to hear her sing such slapped-together record company garbage. ""With You"" isn't THAT bad of a song...okay okay...the 2 stars are for her voice... I'm a fan of hers, but these songs were just very very wrong choices for her to sing."
4,Best yet,"I enjoyed Jessica's first 2 albums, especially Sweet Kisses...her voice just blew me away! Her second one was alright...a little over-produced, but good songs. In This Skin shows more of what Jessica is capable of; where she's headed. She seems more comfortable with the songs on this album than the others. She's not really pushing herself, she co-wrote most of them so she is able to relate to them on a more personal level. I would have to say that ""I Have Loved You"" and ""With You"" are my favorites. She's grown up, she understands true love in it's truest form and feels content with her life...and it shines through in her voice. I have to say, though, that not all of the songs really suit her. It was almost as if she was trying too hard but, you know, you can't please everyone. All in all I think it is her best cd yet and I hope to hear more of this laid back, free-feeling sound from her!"
4,Good CD,"This is a special version of Jessica Simpson's IN THIS SKIN album. It contains 3 bonus tracks, and a DVD. The bonus tracks include an alternate version of ""With You"", and two new songs ""Angels"" (Robbie Williams) and ""Take My Breath Away"" (Berlin). I don't care too much for the new tracks, but it's nice to have. The album has a whole is fairly good though. The ballads especially show Jessica's strength as a singer and an artist. The ballads are personal, such as ""Underneath"" and ""You Don't Have To Let Go"". ""I Have Loved You"", ""Everyday See You"", ""Be"" and ""Loving You"" are other nice ballads. She has a great voice, it's just too bad her singing is overshadowed by her image. Hopefully one day she will be taken seriously as an artist, she could benefit from better songs, but this is a fairly good album."
3,Why?,"I have the first edition of In This Skin ! It's really good.. but i'm verry deceive that she have a Collecter Edition with a DVD !! I will not buy the same cd with 3 more song and a DVD ! I want to buy it ! But i will not pay 14,99 for 2 new song, 1 acoustic and a DVD with her marriage! Anyway..."
1,still a lightweight,Jessica Simpson has a decent enough range but the material here is just there.She doesn't have enough to carry this lighweight set.nothing much has changed since her debut.soft product&a dime a dozen results.
1,shed this skin immediately,i just cant imagine how such an awful album was released by columbia records.this is one of the worst cd's i have ever come across. i can bet that she got her deal solely on the basis of her cute looks and not on the basis of her lousy voice.get rid of this awful cd immediately.it is my opinion that music this bad should have come with a health warning.no stars.get any album from john fogerty instead.
1,Dumb blonde with decent voice,"It's too bad she has very little singing talent,but a whole lot of emptiness between her ears.Maybe she needs to spend her money on an education instead of wasting it on bubblegum drivle such as this and her other cd's....Give it up!!"
1,Really BAD!!,"This is truly a bad collection of songs, especially the covers of Take My Breath Away & Angels. The vocals and production are terrible and it's obvious they were rushed simply to make money off of her newfound fame from Newlyweds. It's sad that buyers are manipulated into buying such an awful album that's a complete waste of money! There isn't one good song on this album and the bonus songs and DVD are worthless and hardly worth it if you already own the album. I've truly lost all the respect I had for Jessica with such a horrible release that is clearly a cheap marketing ploy! Don't buy this, I promise you'll regret it!!"
2,Fans can never be objective...,"I'm repeating myself, but then so is Jessica! Nice...but forgettable."
3,For Fans Only,"I bought this album when it first came out over the summer. It was good a buy at 8.99 at Target. I'm really happy that it finally has found an audience, because I always thought she deserved the success of Britney and Christina. But the newest additions are questionable. ""Angels"" was a great Robbie Williams song, but Jessica really oversings this one. Talk about over wrought! ""Take My Breath Away"" is slightly better, but I was never a great fan of that song to begin with. I opted to download these songs off of Napster rather than part with more of my hard earned money to buy the whole cd again. The bonus dvd does nothing for me. I'm not sure but it is clips from Newlywed and her wedding? Boring..I'll watch Newlywed on MTV. Now if they had bonus footage of Nick showing some skin..well that's a different story! Oh, the acoustic version of ""With You"" is the best of the new material!"
2,Too poppish,"I wish she sang more ballads in this CD. Her 2nd CD was the best one. I wish ""There You Were"" w/ Mark Anthony on the 2nd album played on the radio, but it didn't. For this 3rd album, most of the songs were annoying. I'm a fan of hers, but I only like it when she sings power ballads. ""Underneath"" is the only good on one on here."
1,Boo Hoo!,To me Jessica Simpson can't sing and is just plain stupid. On T.V she said she was bootyful when she aint even got booty like beyonce does or even j-lo even though i hate her. Jessica simpson is flat
3,GOOD BUT THE NEW SONGS SUCK,"There was nothing wrong with this cd when it first came out. It just kind of died on the charts until Newlyweds caught on. Then ""With You"" took of, thanks to a clever video that poked fun at Jessica's ditzy side. The rest of the cd is just as good. ""In This Skin"" is catchy as well as ""Forbidden Fruit"". This was a worthy follow up to ""Irresistable"" which found her dabbling in R&B territory. I'm glad she moved away from that with this CD. This also has some of her best ballads, ""I Have Loved You"" and ""Underneath"" are two of the best on the CD. But please, aquaint yourself with Robbie William's version of ""Angels"" and instead of Jess's version. ""Take My Breath Away"" is nearly as bad. She is definitly singing in some affected way that is truly horrible and I hope someone tells her to NOT sing like this in the future, because it sounds like hell."
1,Can I say refund???,"Ok..seriouly...if it wasn't for her show, The Newleyweds, which I actually love watching..she would not be this sucessful with this album. This album sucks! I actually got it as a gift..THANKFULLY THERE IS STORE CREDIT!! She has a nice voice, but its not like I haven't heard that voice on a million other people. The song Angel...too early to make a cover song out of. Take my breath away..sure didn't take mine away. Sweetest sin...worse pop song I've heard in a while. Overall, because of her ordinary voice and because I found myself skipping every song. Save your money guys."
3,"Used to LOVE it, Not anymore.","When i was younger, I apparently really had an interest in Jessica...I had two of her CDs! I bought this one and loved it, but now I look back on it and think ""Why in the WORLD did I buy this?"" Now when you buy a CD is that really supposed to happen?! I will admit that this album had some nice songs on it, but thats all. Jessica, in my opinion , doesn't have the BEST voice. I pretty much like all her CD's before this one. But I feel that those albums had BETTER songs, and she did a BETTER job with them. Not to say that she messes this CD up, but she had two awesome albums before,so I don't see what happened. Or she just felt like slacking off. So I give it three stars."
3,IN THIS SKIN...maybe a little too much,"I thought that the album was okay. This is the third album I have purchased from Jessica. I still think that her first album was the best but there are a few songs on her new album I think live up to the vocals you would expect from Ms. Simpson I especially liked ""With You"". ""The Sweetest Sin"" is okay also. I still think that she has not found the style of singing she is comfortable with but she is trying. Overall I thought the album was pretty good. You just have to listen to it a few times for it to grow on you. But if you are looking for this to be the best album you have heard from Jessica I am sorry to imform you but that album still does not exist. All in all I give the album 3.5 stars and say good try... but keep looking I would like to here more songs like "" I Wanna Love you Forever."
4,HER BEST YET,I think it shows that she put so much more heart and soul on this record. Almost every song is good. She has definitely made progress on this album in her songs and in her voice. I can't quit listening to it. Its better than both her other albums put together.
2,What horrible covers,Her rendition of Robbie Williams Angels makes my ears hurt. Everytime I hear it on the radio I have to listen to Robbie's version so I feel better. I think she can sing but she can't sing everything. Listen to Robbie Williams if you want a good version of Angels.
4,Nice New Songs,"Pointers for Jessica's people for being smart enough to re-issue this album. Not that the first one was bad *because there are basicly only two new songs*, but might as well milk the girl while she's hot *it is the music buisness people.* Who woulda thought that Jessica would have the biggest hit of her career with ""With You?"" I figured she was washed up after ""Sweetest Sin"" flopped. New songs include the next single ""Take My Breath Away"" *a cover of the Top Gun theme song* and the Robbie Williams cover ""Angels."" A few other of the original highlights include ""In This Skin"", ""Be"" and ""I Have Loved You."" This isn't life altering, but it is pleasant pop music and Jessica does have a voice *it just isn't pushed to its full potential on here.* I'm happy to see her doing well."
4,Very good work.,"First of all I have to say that I thought that this album was going to be an album with only 2 or 3 good songs but actually it's very good.Jessica goes from covers like Robbie Williams's hit ""Angels"" where Jessica gives her whole voice in a very good interpretation and also the hit from the 1986 Top Gun soundtrack ""Take way breath away"" which is her latest single and it's climbing the Hot 100 very fast to her own songs that are better than in the past. The album's first single was ""The sweetest sin"" which is a very good song but didn't make it big (I bought the CD because of that song). Then the Top 16 hit ""With you"" is also very good as ""My way home"" or ""Underneath"".If you're planning to buy this album I'd tell you to get this version that contains a bonus track plus a DVD with footage of Jessica's wedding and also footage from ""Newlyweds"" for just $1 more."
1,BLEH,"RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH, RUBBISH. SHE RUINED BEAUTIFUL SONGS BY BERLIN AND ROBBIE WILLIAMS. DON'T SUPPORT THIS MONEY HUNGRY CASH COW!!"
1,No Substance,"A co-worker of mine lent me this CD and I listened to it with an open mind.What did I think?...The remake of Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"", is awful!Jessica doesn't sing, she breathes or pants into the microphone.It's painful to listen to.I guess a big chest and the bleached blond dummy routine can take a person far!I'll stick to people with talent."
5,"She kills Britney, Christina, and all the other pop artists","This CD is the total package. The songs are amazing and the DVD is a great bonus addition. She'll even be on VH1 Divals Live in Las Vegas and not even Britney or Christina has been on that show. VH1 even thinks that Jessica is better than those fake ... artists, *cough cough...Britney and Christina.* Buy this CD if ya know what's good for ya!"
3,Ballad-heavy.,"Jessica Simpson's 3rd album is more mellow than her first two outings. Most of the songs are lovey-dovey and feature light production. Co-writing about half of the album some of what she feels are in these lyrics. In fact, this is the first album where she wrote on more than one track. Basically, it's a typical pop affair with a couple of standouts.Some key tracks:Everyday See YouWith YouTake My Breath AwayIn This Skin3.5 stars."
2,Great attempt,"Jessica has a beautiful voice and I have been a huge fan. I don't think she has found her niche just yet on this album. Her songs are very hard to stay in your head. They lyrics are very simple but her voice is gorgeous. I love the diversity in all of the songs. They are all different, but I cannot get the lyrics. I hope this album does well, but personally it is not my favorite. She is a sweet girl and this was a great attempt, but not something I would recommend."
1,When Jess lost her talent.,"In This Skin by Jessica Simpson was her attempt to be taken seriously as a singer/songwriter, and I am sorry to say that she failed miserably. This album was released before The Newlyweds hoopla, Jessica's vocals just weren't the same anymore, when her first album was released I thought she had the most natural talent of the four ""poptarts"" (Britney, Christina, and Mandy). Poor Jess just seems bored on this record, tracks like You Don't Have to Let Go, With You, Sweetest Sin, and even the title-track are meaningless pop. I am a fan no more, sorry Jess!"
3,Less than Stellar from a Formerly Stellar Performer...,"Jessica Simpson does not usually act like a fluffy teen performer...except on this album. Don't get me wrong, Jessica is an amazing performer who usually performs, but all of these songs feel as if they are coming from someone else's viewpoint and not Jessica's heart. The album is good and I would reccomend it, but not to those of us who like the real Jessie that we saw previously on her first two albums."
5,First addition,This was the first thing bought after the Visor after noticing how my cat had developed an interest in the stylus. I can only second the accolades of the the reviewers and add this tip: replace your Visor's original stylus with the colored one you dislike most. Since you don't like the color you will never be able to lose the stylus! Extra insurance ;-)
2,These Leave Scratches!,"They look nice, fit the slot perfectly, have a screwdriver and a reset pin... perfect except that the plastic tip seems to be harder than other stylii. Admittedly, I press pretty hard when I write -- but these are the first stylii I've used that leave visible, permanent scratches on the screen! If you write with significant pressure, avoid these or risk damaging your Visor."
4,Need spares? They're the best to have around...,"If you like to have spare stylis around, unless you ""roll your own"" and/or don't have that much disposable income, the 5-pack Rainbow Pack is your choice.At approximately 20 cents more per stylus than a Palm III 3-stylus pack, you get what the newer Visors come bundled with: A sturdy, dependable stylus with the reset pin and screwdriver; not the plastic stick originally supplied.I'm not picky about the color matching-- at least I can tell which spare stylis I have next to my keyboard. With 5 stylis, you can have a spare at the office, by the home computer, in your travel case, etc."
5,Styli for the stylish,"The Handspring Visor Stylus Rainbow Pack is the stylus that should have come with the Handspring Visor Deluxe.It comes in five colours to fit any Visor of any colour.The advantage these styli have over the standard stock stylus that comes with the Visor is that they are made of metal and have a nice heft to it when you write.The coolest thing about the Rainbow styli is that they all have a reset pin integrated into the stylus body (something glaringly missing in the stock stylus. Just unscrew the writing tip and there it is. This is about the most important part of the stylus and will save you when your Visor hangs on you.A surprise is that when you unscrew the other end of the stylus, you get a very nice Philips screwdriver that can be used to open your Visor, if necessary. I found that the screwdriver also works really well for tightening the screws on my glasses! :)"
4,Good reference for young readers,"The American Heritage Student Dictionary contains concise, easy to read definitions and helpful pictures, mostly of animals, historical figures, and illustrations of abstract concepts. The pictures are in black and white, but for the age that this reference tool is focused, I believe color pictures would have made the pages come to life more. The dictionary includes periodic table, taxonomy chart, historical era chart, and weights & measurements charts spread thoughout the book. I would have preferred these charts all at the beginning or end for easier usage."
4,great student resource...elementary and up,"Great layout, well illustrated for information and interest. My second grader is using it for her homework which involves looking up definitions of spelling/vocab words. This was much more student-friendly than the large classic Webster's edition, easier to find an understandable definition that a second-grader could read. Most (all?)of her words have had an example sentence that helps understand how the word might be used in context. My only suggestion...our old dictionary had those thumb-cut-out tab sorts of things that let you easily thumb to a particular letter quickly...no such help here, and it can be painfully slow for her to find where a particular letter starts. We actually used the post-it mini tabs to make our own landmarks to turn to.Overall a great choice and I am sure it will be suitable through junior high and beyond."
5,Great addition to our homeschool library! Love it!,"I bought the dictionary and thesaurus for our homeschool library. I love them both. They are easy to use and include pictures of selected entries. Some entries have a full page dedicated to them, like geologic time, and solar system. The book also includes biographical information. At the front of the book a lesson in dictionary use, as well as parts of speech and other helpful language arts tid bits can be found. My six year old can use this dictionary, and she will continue to use it for quite some time. It is NOT one of those kids' dictionaries full of pictures. It is quite helpful and user friendly!"
5,A must for any student library,"My son is 10 and in fourth grade. We use this dictionary just about everyday for studying poetry. So far, every word we've looked up has been there and with enough explanation to really make sense. We looked up the word ""tread"" - there were several definitions (about 4 inches worth), but each gave a sentence for context, which helped him pick out the right definition to apply. We also looked up ""limerick"" - the definition given was complete in that it actually included the rhyming scheme used, which was not included in two other dictionaries we have. There are color pictures and the the writing is large enough for him to read. It was also very reasonably priced. We are very happy with this Dictionary; we liked it so much we bought the American Heritage Thesaurus to go with it!"
3,Not profound but an enjoyable Anderson story,"In this novel the reader is introduced to newly minted Ensign Flandry, age nineteen, fresh out of the Space Navy Academy, full of patriotism for the Empire and equally full of skepticism for efforts at detent with the Evil Empire- The Merseian.Once we digest the apparent similarities with Horatio Hornblower, push aside the cardboard characters - appealing natives, reptilian enemies and incompetent leaders, accept the E. E. Smith space antics we are left with a story, not profound or rich in ideas, but with enough adventure to keep the pages turning.Our saga concerns Terra and the Merseian who each support opposing factions in a civil war on the planet Starket. The conundrum for the Flandry and the Space navy forces is why does the Merseians continue to escalate the conflict risking a catastrophic war with Terra. You will have to read the book to find the answer.Light and enjoyable entertainment for fans of Poul Anderson."
1,I couldn't watch all of it,"Horrible story, bad casting (with only a few exceptions), and what's with the overly loud, saccharine background music???? I felt sorry for the actors though they may have had little idea while filming what a disaster this would be. I bought it because I was looking for Robert Fuller performances and no one on Amazon had written a bad review. This is a bad, bad, bad, bad film."
2,How to screw up a great franchise.,"A lot of real talent was wasted in the making of this disaster. So many fine actors and well known faces it is a real shame it did not come off better. A great actor can only do so much when handed a piece of trash to work with. This script was lifeless, the direction uninspired, the music completely obnoxious and the filming stiff. I can live with a totally predictable plot (what Bonanza episode wasn't)if it is done with intelligence and style, but a bad plot is a bad plot and this one is worse. Preachy, unrealistic and forced. What a sad thing!"
3,Still a Bonanza Fan,"I purchased this Bonanza film along with the Bonanza Under Attack film and honestly I wanted more. I thought the films were ok. I happen to be a fan of Bonanza and because I got this for such a great price it makes it worth it and a important part of my DVD collection. If you enjoy the shows and are truly a fan, and can find a seller with a great price, than I say it is worth it to make this purchase."
3,I Prefer 1602 A.D.,"Although the game has better graphics, 1602 A.D. was more fun. What I loved about 1602 A.D. was a map creator. I was very dissapointed to see it was not in 1503 A.D. The game looked so good unfortunately it wasn't. It's is also way to hard. I suggest you buy 1602 A.D."
2,This game is sooooo boring!!!!!,"I bought this game used for really cheap so I'm not mad about the money I wasted but I am ticked about the time I spent trying to figure this stupid game out. First, the tutorial taught me just about nothing. I had to read the manual over and over again. My sheep NEVER had enough grazing land even though everything was cleared. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make or buy tobacco. I only found 2 cultures and I couldn't even sign a treaty with one of them. If I managed not to lose my scout, the only thing I ever found was more mineral deposits that did me no good because I couldn't build on any other islands but my own. All I did was watch my money go down and down and down. I wish they would of made this game a little more user friendly. It might have been enjoyable then."
1,For kindergarden kids,"This is a game for 5 years old. A real economy does not function like that at all! It needs a government, rules, accounts and so on. It is impossible to really control anything in this game where really annoying things happen (why prevent those stupid potatos to reach this stupid tavern for the only reason that a piece of mud road is missing!). This is not the sort of thing that makes a game funny!I am still looking for a strategy game where invading your neighbour is not the only way to win and where the economy functions on a truly realistic basis. This is not the one (despite fun graphics)!"
3,Arg!,"Well this is a perfect example of what happens to a good game idea that gets developed in a vacuum. While the inherent idea behind the game is sound, the interface is astoundingly annoying.The game itself is reminiscient of Knights & Merchants but without the complexity. Your buildings will instantly spawn if you have the building materials. Don't worry about building a transportation infrastructure within your colony because people/carts can easily move through each other. Oh and if you want to clear some land then it's much faster just to build a road through it and then demolish it since instant road building is a lot faster than having a woodcutting actually cut down the trees.Well enough logical error with the game. You'll find the interface to be so-so(sans the lack of a pause)... I'll still play the game but it's painful to think of the wasted potential it could have easily attained."
2,Not that great,"Build through power, build through peace and build through pure frustration. This game is so complicated, that its a drag to play. First of all I'll start by saying that the graphics look spectaculaire. Secound of all it takes for ever to do any thing in the game. You'll try to explore, manage a growing empire and build a thriving colony over many many days of playing. You'll constantly run into money problems and to this day I still can't figure out how to set traid routs. Dureing this game you will rarely get attacked on land and your traid boats will conatantly get harrsed by pirates and your enemys. This game looked good on the rack in the store, but when you start to play it you'll relize that the game isnt that great. If you want a good stratigy game, get strongholed or age of empires."
2,A Texas Ranger,"A very slow starting book. It got a little better, but not much. The language and grammer were terrible. They didn't really talk that bad back then. I don't recommend this book."
2,Very poorly written,I tried but could not get past the first few pages. I am a big fan of the old time western authors but this one just was not up to par.
1,It stunk,It doesn't even deserve one star you could almost figure out what was going to happen next before you read it.
3,My review,A bit slow and old fashioned. But what can you expect for free. Language a was somewhat distracting. Not highly recommended.
2,A Texas ranger,"A little sappy, but not too bad reading. More like two books from the way it jumped from one place to another."
5,A Western,Would recommend this book for reading for adults that are interested in the western theme of writing. Enjoyed the book immensely.
3,Author's opinion,The book had a fairly good plot. I wasn't impressed with the authors style and use of words. I really don't think I would download any more of his work.
4,Western love story and ministry,"Enjoy westerns and enjoyed very much the vocabulary in this book. The story line was little weak but, it was still a fun read."
5,An invaluable learning tool!,"This little grammar book has just the right information for someone like me, who's constantly on the go. It's organized alphabetically, which makes it extremely easy to look something up. I think it covers the major and most common grammar points quite well. In addition, it's size and portability make this book a must have. Good job!"
3,A weak beginning to a good series,"THE CRIME AT BLACK DUDLEY (aka The Black Dudley Murder) ((Amateur Sleuth, Albert Campion, England, 1920s) - GoodAllingham, Margery - 1st in series (EBMRG Selection)Penguin Books, 1929, US PaperbackFirst Sentence: The view from the narrow window was dreary and inexpressibly lonely.What is supposed to be an entertaining weekend at a large country home in Suffolk, becomes the site of murder, kidnapping and suspense. Dr. George Abbershaw is forced to sign a death certificate, and foolish Albert Campion is not what he seems.I had forgotten how silly and over-plotted this first book is of the Campion series and that Campion appears as a secondary character. And, stereotypical as they seem today, Allingham was wonderful at creating a cast of characters, each with their own voice.The fun of the book is the setting, both in place and time. Trust me, the series does improve with subsequent books."
3,First Campion mystery has me intrigued..,"Written in the late twenties, ""Black Dudley Murder"" is the first of Margery Alligham's Albert Campion mysteries, but Campion here is in an auxillary role, and this doesn't fit well with the story, but there is an interesting mystery and thriller element to how the characters have to escape from a isolated mansion after the host is killed as mobsters control the house. The younger folks are the good guys, and the older ones, except for Campion are the bad guys. Interesting twist at the end as the killer is revealed and his motive is explained."
2,Don't be put off by this poor start,"This is silly stuff, full of cliches of plucky Englishmen, sinister foreigners and master criminals. There are too many characters, many of whom aren't involved in events often enough to justify their inclusion or don't even have a speaking role, and I didn't find any of them appealing, unfortunately. The plotting is rather clumsy and poorly paced. Both denouments (of the criminal gang and murder storylines) are ridiculous. As for Campion, I found him a little too roughly drawn to be entirely convincing as a character yet. He helps drive the action without being truly central to the plot. The book could have done without him, or he without it. Thankfully, Margery Allingham became a much better writer with a much better sense of plot and pacing in her later books. A curiosity only.On another note, this is a very nice book to read: an easy size to hold, with quality paper and a good font. Superior to the Vintage editions."
2,"Small, Very Bright, Very Short Battery Life","I'm a contractor and I've had the Stinger Streamlight (Poly) in daily use for a little over a month. It is compact and very very bright. As you read the manufacturer's description, pay close attention to these two stats: ONE HOUR CONTINUOUS USE, TEN HOUR CHARGE TIME. That's 10 minutes of charging for every minute you use the light. I usually need the light for about half an hour. That means every two uses, it's out of commission again for 10 hours. I have to carry a mini MAG as a backup. The Stinger is bright, small and durable (it has survived a few hard drops), but it is totally impractical because of the fast discharge and long recharge. Save your money."
5,so bummed this was canceled,"this was one of the best shows on last year, so cute, witty and funny, I loved it! the characters, the plot lines, the sexy actors (Nick Roux, David Clayton Rogers, Matthew Atkinson & Rowly Dennis) such a great show! if you liked the Devil Wears Prada, you will LOVE this show, but viewer beware! the first season ends and leaves ya hanging, you can look up online what WOULD have happened had they been signed for a second season, but unfortunatley apparently the audience wasn't there....total bummer! ahh-mazing show though!"
1,This is NOT the Speilberg / SciFi channel mini-series!,"I noticed that a couple of reviewers had mistaken this 1999 movie starring Dabney Coleman for the 'Taken' mini-series that aired in 2002 on the SciFi Channel. It is NOT.That mini-series in not yet available as I write (March 2003), but should be released later this year.Just thought you should know."
4,Taken,"I really enjoyed this movie. Dabney Coleman was excellent in this film, and I was so impressed with his acting. I only remember seeing him in comedy. I highly recommend this movie. The movie reminds us all that sometimes people in our own family are hiding secrets that would astound us. Good movie."
5,"Coleman's brave role as ""HEAD HONCHO HELD HOSTAGE"" wins big","Dabney Coleman is so believeable in his lead role in TAKEN that you almost forget he is acting. Dabney Coleman in the fashion industry? He is quietly compelling and honest in his role as company ""Head Honcho Held Hostage"". This DVD offers a rarely-seen warmer Dabney Coleman forced into a desperate and dark world of harsh betrayal and the violation of all sense of security in his life. Kidnapped and broken, Dabney Coleman maintains a stark realism that carries flawlessly and carefully through this entire film. He makes you wonder if you would have the strength to survive if faced with the same circumstances. TAKEN relies on the ""less is more"" theme in movie making. What it lacks in soundtrack music and glossy visuals, it more than completes in raw emotion and flawless acting by the charismatic and compelling Dabney Coleman. TAKEN in DVD format is sharp and clear and the editing is flawless."
3,COPY TO FLOPPY DISK,"Not since ""9 to 5"" has Dabney Coleman been in such a jam. Dabney stars as Ethan Grover, a business man with a loyal secretary (Dorothée Berryman) and a disloyal wife (Linda Smith). She is having an affair with his business partner Alan Cross (Stewart Bick) while his closet gay CFO (Michael Rudder) is skimming funds. To add to the mix he has a step son with a gambling and drug problem (Brett Watson).When Ethan is kidnapped by Bill (Dennis Boutsikaris) his wife balks at payment. The film has some some minor twists which are easier to figure out than a one star Sodoku.The acting was bland and the writing very white bread.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, brief sex, brief nudity (Monique Derix, Jessie Foo)"
4,How close were we to accidental detonation?,"Over-worked and under-paid is a fair description of the men and women of the Air Force who are charged with maintaining nuclear tipped ballistic missiles. The Titan missile was a liquid filled beast that demanded constant attention. One slip of the tool and the chain reaction began. Brave souls gave their lives to try and salvage the bird in silo 7. But, does anyone know that the warhead was blown out of the silo and landed in a nearby field? Are there others we don't know about? You will admire the bravery of the enlisted men, and you will be disgusted at how they were treated. The silent war continues to this day across the plains of Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. The Minuteman III has solid rocket fuel and is far less vulnerable than the Titan; nonetheless, young men and women risk their lives regularly to keep these birds on alert. We should never forget the sacrifices of the silent heroes that maintain our fleet of nuclear missiles!"
4,"A Made for TV Movie. Based on a real ""EVENT"" in New Mexico","This is a good made for TV movie. Easily worth the $5. Im glad to see it available on VHS even though it didnt make it to the theaters. This movie is based on an actual airforce event that took place at a Silo in New Mexico. The movie was filmed just south of Tuscon Az in the only formerly active silo from the cold war that is open to the public. One of the Airman involved in the actual explosion played a small role in the movie and worked to keep the facts straight on this ""Fictional Movie"". Two actors Reggie Jones and Cordell Rich were left out of the credits but did well on their respective bit parts. Reggie as an Air Force Airman and Cordell as the Medic who worke on Michael and ""Pepper"" in the ambulance."
5,Houston Junior League does it again!,The Junior League of Houston combines fabulous recipes with usefulcooking techniques and extraordinary pictures in their new cookbook.This southern bouquet of recipes is the best around!
5,Excellent,"This is my favorite cookbook. Because the recipes are very thoroughly tested, unlike many cookbooks, I can trust that the recipes are accurate and easy to follow. I also love that all the recipes call for fresh ingredients, and it is an excellent book to use when cooking for company or holidays."
4,Good cookbook,"I've prepared several of the recipes, and they are delicious. A wide variety of simple to prepare dishes. Love the cover, too. Book was in good condition, like new, barely used. Quick shipment, too, which I like."
5,"Hands down, my favorite cookbook","I have owned this cookbook for several years and I have given it as a hostess gift numerous times. The recipes in it have never failed me and I feel completely confident to do a first run for guests. The photos are amazing and I especially like the table setting pictures and the lineup of every piece of flatware imaginable.If you haven't tried the recipes for chicken salad with cranberries and pecans, the grilled pork tenderloin with dijon mustard and orange marmalade, the mushroom pate, or the field greens with spicy pecans and blue cheese (I substitute feta), get in the kitchen now and start cooking. I promise, you will love them all."

1,This cd is so bad.......,"This cd is very good because it has DMX, Ja Rule, Ludacris, and Tupac... but this cd doesn't have the best rapper of the summer which is 5o CENT on it.. 50 had the best song of the summer with ""In Da Club"" so there is no reason that he should not b on this cd... I think that the people at the Source r just jelous of 50 and his success..."
5,what's so bad about this cd,Good hiphop cd. All the good songs are on here expect for 50 cent's.this cd has not left my cd player in a week. quite hatin.

2,Worst of the lot,"For a while, the Source's yearly cd's have been alright, including their best effort (1998's disc). But since then, they have been in decline. Usually releasing the best rap of their year, this one pulls songs from as early as august 2002 (ll cool j- luv u better) and a handful of tracks from late 2002 (sept-nov.) including: 2pac- thugz mansion, benzino- rock the party, nelly- air force 1's (from nelly's cd released in june 2002). I know Benzino couldn't land eminem, obie trice, or 50 Cent, but neither of those 3 had a song deserving to be called tops of 2003 in the first place. Missing from this are radio regulars ""Shake Ya' Tailfeather"",""Get Low"", and ""Pump it Up"" as well as deserving turns from Gangstarr, Freddie Foxxx, Keith Murray, T.I., and others. Do yourself a favor and just burn your own ""best of..."" cd so u can use this money to buy something more worthwhile like the new Black Moon- Total Eclipse LP or the slept on Nappy Roots- Wooden Leather."
2,Too many ads,"Shutter Bug has a lot of potential, but the ads kill it completely! I couldn't read a single article without having to skip a few pages of advertisements. Ridiculous."
3,Too much clutter,It has value and the articles are well written but all the advertisements distract from the content. Great magazine if you want to know about the latest gear and what is new in photography. Overall a little disappointing.
4,Better Photography,"This magazine is well worth the small price, because it is packed with loads of professional training tools that will help one become a better photographer. In addition, there are great reviews, and cliff hangers, such as well written reviews that leave you waiting for more. I appreciate that, since I am taking my time and learning to wield my camera as a tool. It gives me the opportunity to put the information to the test, to actually learn something. I would recommend this magazine to anyone."
1,What will they pay me for reading it?,"If this magazine was merely filled with lots of ads and had actually useful content it might be worth the money. However, ignoring the 70% of its pages filled with ads, what's left is not worth reading. The ""reviews"" are thinly veiled ads themselves- no criticism allowed. As for the photos (and this is supposed to be a photography magazine after all) many of them are at high amateur / low professional level. Whether this is due to a problem with Shutterbug's printing or not finding better photographers I can not tell."
2,If i wanted a catalog i would of gotten a catalog... and for free,"I won't give it a 1, since they tried and and i've read some article which was okay. I don't think I read an article that gave me a WOW factor and tried something new. The magazine was kinda boring. If you are looking for inspiration... look elsewhere, looking for product review look elsewhere. I have 4 shutterbug magazines so far and they are very boring, jack of most trades master of none. I guess i'll keep getting it, but i'm not looking forward for next months issues."
3,magazine,"Ive had a subscription to this magazine in the past and I liked it. So I subscribed again. But its taken about 3 months and I still have not had a magazine delivered. Im rather disappointed that it would take so long for them to deliver to an address they have delivered to in the past, and no word as to why. I dont know if I will renew again at this rate."
3,non delivered magazine,"I received one issue but then the delivery stopped. I would like to receive the remaining issues of my order,"
2,It's just ads.,"I regret giving this to my boyfriend as a birthday present. They said it might take 12 weeks to get it, but it actually took around 14 weeks, and only after I called and complained repeatedly. I was slightly rebuffed for a while, as apparently, 13 weeks is not too long to wait. The magazine itself is full of ads which might be useful to a professional photographers, but is in no way helpful to an enthusiast."
2,"It's been more than a month, and still hasn't arrived.","Unfortunately, I can't really review the magazine because I still haven't received it. The date they said it would arrive passed 2 wks ago."
3,Good to look at while in a bookstore,This is a very basic photography magazine that is best read quickly in the store and put back into the rack.The camera and lens reviews on the internet are superior and the magazine is bogged down with a ton of advertisements.Conclusion: save your money.
4,Love the magazine,"I just received my first issue of Shutterbug. Despite the many pages of advertising (some of which is actually informative), I find that the magazine is full of helpful tips, supplemented by products that are relevant to the advice. I look forward to the other issues and if the quality of the magazine endures, so will my subscription to it."
2,I tried...,"I've been receiving Shutterbug for a while.The articles, for the most part, are OK. Once in a while I run into very some very good articles.Unfortunately, regardless of the quality of the article, the ratio of ads versus usable content is awful.They'll literally use about 10% of a two page spread on the article while 90% is reserved for ads.I don't mind having some ads. I understand that's how they're making a lot of their money, but I'm also paying for the subscription and feel like I don't get my money's worth..."
2,Paying for ads?,"The amount of content in this magazine vs advertisements is pathetic! I actually enjoy glancing at an ad or two on cameras, lenses, etc. But to be paying for a subscription to ""Photo Ad Magazine"" doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me! Stay away from this one unless you're just trying to keep abreast of products and pricing! The amount of actual photography skills content and the like is all but non-existent!"
2,Not what we hoped,"When I ordered this magazine, I wanted somethng that would help improve and give good tips for photography but it is primarily ads. When it comes, it is breezed through and tossed in the recycle bin."
4,Shutterbug Magazine,"Good, informative articles covering a wide range of photographic topics. Great reviews of both equipment and software. The tips are informative and helpful for all ranges of users."
1,yellowstone,Terrible the only sound that was good was the machine turning off. If it was free it would have costto much
2,BUYER BEWARE---The beginning of the Chip Davis Rehash,"I'm sure Steamroller fans of the GREAT old days have realized this band is toast and totally out of ideas and have been for some time. Mega-wealth does strange things to folks, and in Chip Davis' and Jackson Berkey's case...a case of extreme laziness. While Saving the Wildlife had some previously released material, this release from 1989 is where Davis realized that ''Greatest Hits'' (so-called) collections will sell also. On this release, tracks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 15 are all rehashes from previous Fresh Aire releases. I haven't been afflicted like some who have stated that listening to their masterworks of the 70s and 80s is too painful knowing what this band has now become. Fresh Aire 1-7, Saving the Wildlife, and the first two Christmas albums are still so ""fresh"" and exciting. But for the present...no more of my money, Chip. Sorry, I work too hard for it."
1,Did not sound like Yellowstone looks,Only liked one song. The rest were not up to par. Yellowstone is a magical place & the album did not capture its essence.
2,Very sparse information and most of it from others,I cannot review this because there was little information I had not already read from other sources. It is not a book--it is a pamphlet masquerading as a book
2,Great Booklet...slow service,I was delighted to find this booklet online however the 2 week wait will keep me from ordering from these people again.
2,"Interesting, but no guidance","A very interesting book, but sparse in facts. I would like to have seen more information on dosage etc."
1,Barbie Team Gymnastics,This is a great idea and my daughter would have loved it but the software is too old and will not work on modern computers. I contacted software support but was told they no longer offer support for this product. I went to their website and found that there is no patch available for it either. I set my computer up to run the software in Windows 95 mode but it still would not work. Their website instructs if you have a Pentium computer then this software will not work at all.
1,it did not compute,"Unfortunately we could not install(or rather the CD was imcompatible with our version of Windows) the CD ordered because apparantly it's an old version and we have Windows XP Home. So, I guess we waisted the $s, unless you have some sugestion as to how this can be installed. It would have been nice if we were made aware of this when ordered.HPardellBarbie Team Gymnastics (Jewel Case)"
1,Buyer Beware!,"This is a great IDEA for a software title - unfortunately it's a big disappointment to the kids if your computer won't run it - as our 2-year old Dell wouldn't. It started out okay, but about three minutes in, a warning comes up stating ""CPU Not Supported."" So make sure your computer (not just your operating system) meets the spcifications before you buy."
5,good guide,"I thought the book was really good, better for an intermediate and very very good for a novice-than for some one who's advanced. Advanced people will find the training info average to good but the nutrition part is very good"
5,complete and thorough for anyone who want to get big,This book is really thorough in explaining how to put together a workout and nutrtion eatin plan for a beginner to advanced gym junkie.
4,awesome book,"Nothing really revolutionary but an easy read that contains many important aspects into how to train, eat, and supplement for awesome gains. Only thing I hate is how the book is cheaply made into a hard cover."
2,Stylus pen not user friendly,"Streamlight 65022 Stylus 3-AAAA LED Pen Light, Black with Ice Blue BeamI am pleased with the size and the light quality for this pen light, but it is hard to turn on and maintain in the on position for longer than a couple moments at a time. The on button is at the very end of the long, slender tube, and the action is so hard that it puts a dent in whatever digit you use to depress it. Leverage to keep it on is equally hard. If I had it to do over, I would look for a better product design."
1,TOO SMALL,"Perfect in every way for its intended use, it would rate 5 stars, except for two things: 1. It is WAY WAY TOO SMALL, even though it is relatively long, it's diameter is strangely tiny-- you will lose it forever when it drops into some crack, and 2. The weirdo, expensive batteries. Just wait until you lose it in the dark and you really need it!"
5,Pen light that is REALLY the size of a pen,"Or at least the diameter.Most ""pen lights"" have a much bigger diameter than a normal pen. And most pen lights feel pretty flimsy. Neither is the case here. The Streamlight Stylus is a bit longer than most pens, but is slim enough to fit into pen pockets and loops. Despite the slim profile, it feels solid. It comes with a plastic tube that fits over the light and can give more of a spotlight effect rather than an area light. The cover engages the ridges machined into the sides of the light body, and seems to stay in place well. The LED provides very bright illumination, and the push button can be lock on. The pen clip is blued. While this might seem trivial, it does fit in better with military gear.I'd like a way to lock the light off at need, but this is a minor criticism compared to all the strong points of this light.Overall, a nice little penlight for everyday use.E.M. Van Court"
2,Great Light But!!!,"The light arrived in timely fashion and it worked, but it seemed dim by comparison to what I thought it should be.I took the top off to take out the batteries and discovered the second and third batteries were badly corroded and only after soaking them with WD40 was I able to get them out."
4,Cool Light Pen,"This pen is really good on hunting, however I dont hunt. The beam is really bright. The reason I bought this item because I read John Lee hacking wii remote and use LED pen to draw on the screen. I thought I might give it shot on this pen. This pen didn't work and I try other led keychain light is works fine except this pen."
3,A young Maya,Maya sings the oldies and does a great job of it. This albums is for real collectors of the artform.
1,Great lady but not a singer.,"Truthfully, when I listen to a singer, all I care about is the quality of the voice. I know that screaming and shrieking are in style. Some people say that Rap is music and that it has meaning. Some people care about the beat. I read a bunch of Maya Angelou's books and I was impressed so I bought her song. Don't do it. She can't sing. She can WRITE and she is a fine person. Read all of her books. But I don't recommend listening to this disc.Judi"
3,Good for fast results (without lengthy background),"If you know little of Java, this helps without writing endless code. I gave 3 of 5 stars because examples are hard to see. It's not cert material, but it is a good workbook. The author shows small useful apps. This allows growth and creativity. The disk gives some good extras.Great effort explaining hard topics in few words."
1,Never buy this book !,"Being useless for the deleloper and teachless for the beginner, it is terrible to read and your eyes are gonna be in real danger if you insist to try. They call it 'handcrafted illustrations' - absolutely unreadable - try to read the sample page 14 to see what you are going to get. And, of course, you will learn nothing about Java - you will just type their samples one by one.I am in software industry for about 12 years and I have never read anything worse than this."
2,"Not for beginnerrs, no matter what the title says","If you're a beginner to Latin, don't know a lick of Latin, then this book is not for you, regardless of what the title says. The author's English grammar isn't very good; and by the time you finish a paragraph you'll wonder what he is talking about, unless you're a linguist. It's an alright book for the first few chapters, but then it just piles on loads of confusing and incomprehensible grammobabble (unless you're a linguist) after about chapter 7.Some of the answers in the back of the book are wrong, too.If you're new to Latin, look elsewhere."
1,Not recommended,"I do not think this is a good book to learn Latin. The method used in this book, if there is any method used at all, is not suited to self-learning. Explanations are confusing, missing, not clear. I would highly advice not to buy this book at all."
4,teach yourself latin complete course,If you have no Latin back ground to call on. A Latin book no matter how good can not 'Teach youself Latin'! A teacher of Latin should be sourcedThis book with such a teacher is a excellent guide in bringing to life this dead languageUTERE FELIX
2,Teach Yourself Latin...provided you already know it,"This book is certainly not for beginners. It's more of a review for someone who already has a firm grasp on conjugation, cases, and so on. If you're an autodidact working your way into Latin, forget this one. My recommendation would be to spend your money instead on something like Lingua Latina (a direct-method reader) and/or Wheelock's.It's my opinion that this book will serve more to confuse right up front and very likely discourage further study into the language."
2,Not for beginners,"I don't recommend this book for beginners, and I'm sure experienced Latin learners could find a better refresher course elsewhere. The book seems to go out of its way to present everything in as dull and user-unfriendly a format as possible, from huge tables of declensions with very little accompanying information to surprisingly bad descriptions of grammatical functions (this book features the worst description of a pluperfect tense I have ever seen).For those like me who are interested in working their way into the language slowly on their own time, I recommend the Oxford Latin course, which is quite simple (sometimes too much so) but not hopelessly discouraging, as this book is."
3,It is more advanced than I expected. Came without audio cd.,It is more advanced than I expected. Came without audio cd. If I were to get something like this again I would make sure it came with the audio cds that come with it new. I would also make sure to get additional materials to go along with it. I would not rely on this alone.
2,Puns don't carry a story,"I bought this book on the strength of a hilarious and elegant quote. I was encouraged by the pun in the title, and hoped for an entertaining read. Disappointment - the plot was thin, the writing mostly pedestrian. Churchill's occasional flashes of wit don't make up for the general silliness."
1,Very disapointing !,"Three hours of patchwork, poor licks, and too many guests that bring no added value to the ensemble. The Flecktones are out of gas on this one. The album sounds like an experiment that went wild and bad. Still a few tracks are good : Puffy, Off the Top ( Gravity wheel and Line Dance ) but that isn't enough to justify the price."
5,Bela is taking jazz to places joyful!,"I'd suggest you listen to the sampler music, and if the sample music ""hits you"" with its accessible, imaginative layering, then be prepared for a 2 1/2 hour feast from this 3-CD set. It is truley some of the most creative, joyful jazz/new folk I've heard - you know the group is really enjoying themselves as they play these tunes.Also thanks Bela for your humility. My children love your concerts, your music makes even our youngest smile. It's such an up to listen you guys."
5,Bela And the Flecktones at their greatest,"I sincerely agree, this is the FINEST Bela Fleck and the Flecktones album yet. On three CD's it includes the styles of each flecktones' and bela's individual albums. There is not a defining genre for this CD-- It covers areas of jazz, acid jazz, bluegrass, folk, celtic/irish, country and even rap/soul. The musicianship on this album is superb, flawless, indescribable and above all is the sweetest thing your ear will hear this year. You shouldn't call yourself a Fleck fan unless you own this album. Your appreciation for their music will soar. This would be a perfect CD for the new Flecktones fans out there. It is beautifully and masterfully done. Bravo for Bela fleck and the gang for reaches to new and excuisite heights!!!"
4,My Kingdom for a Proofreader with knowledge of history!!,"All in all, a very good book. I enjoy D'Este's writing style. But the glaring historical errors leave one dumbfounded. In the chapter on Ike's West Point years, it is noted that he and his cadet colleagues kept up on the progress of the war in Europe in spite of the absence at West Point of radios and newspapers.Radios--in 1914?? All they had then were ""spark"" sets, over which Morse Code could be transmitted. As I recall, the first commercial radio broadcast was made in 1920, over KDKA in Pittsburgh.I volunteer to proofread your next book, Col. D'Este."
3,Too repetetive,This is an average book that could have probably been written in 500 pages instead of 700. The author repeated himself on numerous occassions. At times he would delve into a future story only to then recover it when it got to that point of the book. How many times do I need to be told that there were rumors of him having an affair with Kay. I was also very dissapointed that the book ended at the end of Germany's surrender. I am going to have to find another book to finish the biography.
3,A little disapointed...........,"This book follows IKE from his birth up to the German surrender of WW2 but then it abruptly ends.The book is a ""soldier's story"" but does not tell us about IKE after ww2 when he was in charge of post war Germany and how he came to leave the Army.In my opinion the period when he leaves the Army is just as important in his ""soldier's story"" as when he joined it."
3,Middling,"I came away from this book with a good portrait of Ike and a much better understanding of how grueling the Normandy campaign was, especially after D-Day. Perhaps that should have been sufficient reward, but Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life suffers from annoying flaws. Plenty of twisted sentences made it past its editor. The book is also terribly repetitious (How many times do we have to read that Ike was a heavy smoker?). On a deeper level, other than the decision to go ahead with the Normandy invasion on June 6, what role did Eisenhower play in shaping the invasion plans? D'Este doesn't answer this question clearly. The most annoying aspect of the book is D'Este's tendency to quote other authors and lean on their opinions. It's fine if he agrees with the judgments of his fellow Ike scholars, but he owes his readers his own judgments, in his own words, with the historians he leans on (or disputes) relegated to the footnotes."
5,Cuts mild steel like butter,"I was very amazed at how well this drill bit cuts through metal. It's just like the video. Use enough cutting oil and it will last a long time. I put 30+ holes in 1/4 - 1/2"" steel plate and the last hole was as easy as the first. I wish I had more of these bits other than the 2 sizes I bought."
2,Do Not Buy for rear facing,"I bought this seat and the Britax Roundabout at the same time. The Britax was going to be for the main car and the Graco for the occassional car. The Britax is awesome, worth every penny. The features etc are not found on any other seat. The Graco Comfortsport has a really nice padding, but that's where is stops. In the rear facing installation, you have to put a rolled up towel under it for stability (no kidding, it is in the instructions). Also, once the seat is LATCHed in, you cannot get to the belt to pull the straps tight or release them. I owned this seat for four hours and promptly returned for a second Britax. Save yourself the hassle and buy a Britax."
3,"Comfy, but baby slumps when asleep","I also have done a lot of research on carseats, and this one seemed to fit the bill. To me, it is the most padded and cushy carseat I have found. One of the bummers I have come across is whenever my daughter of 10 months old falls asleep in it, she ends up slummped over far enough where her face ends up with harness strap prints. Also, the seat is so huge that I can no longer see her from the mirror I have fixed on the back seatfacing her car seat. And furthermore, the straps for the shoulder harness seem far apart for her narrow shoulders. Sometimes they slip right off. Babies-r-us has a 90 day return policy, and I am still debating on whether I should return or not."
2,Impossible to adjust straps in rear facing position,"We purchased this seat for our 7 month old son. We have used many Graco products in the past and felt that this seat would suit our needs. I love the leveling bar that the seat has, it takes all of the guess work out of installation. However, we found that it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to adjust the straps when the seat is in the rear facing position. By the time you worked your hand down to the strap lever, the seat wasn't tight in the car anymore. After a week of struggling with this seat, we returned it and purchased the Evenflo Triump 5 (with the rollers on the side to adjust the straps) and we love it.Overall, I think that this would be a good seat for forward facing, but it's not very easy to use for rear facing."
3,Fits into airplane seats. Tough to adjust rear-facing,"We bought the ComfortSport because it is one of the narrowest seats and we really needed a seat that would fit in narrow airplane seats. This works fine in airplanes although it will always have to face forward since there is not enough room in planes for it to be rear-facing. Also, some airlines insist on facing child seats forward, regard of the age of the baby (ie newborns and infants). I was pleasantly surprised that the ComfortSport could sit in my stroller (a Zooper) so that my daughter could sit in the carseat, while in the stroller, which makes maneuvering through airports much easier.As for using the ComfortSport in a car, I must agree that it is very difficult to adjust the straps in the rear-facing position. It works much better if you grab the straps on the back of the seat, and tighten them by hand first, and then pull the adjuster strap and lock it in place. It's not well designed and should be relocated, but it works."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"We registered for this because Baby Bargains recommended it. What a disappointment. It is cheaply made. Our son was visibly uncomfortable in it. He always got sweaty sitting against the fake ""leather"" trim. You will use a convertible carseat for a few years...make the investment in a good one. We now own 2 Britax, and they are worth every penny. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone."
1,Difficult to adjust the straps,"We are very disappointed with the Graco ComfortSport. When it is rear-facing, it is extremely difficult to adjust the straps, especially to make them bigger. We actually found it easier to take the carseat out to loosen the straps and then reinstall it. Hopefully this will improve when we switch to forward-facing next month, but if not, we will be buying a new carseat. I would not recommend this product. We used the Graco infant carseat and loved it, but this one has design flaws. We have since heard this complaint from other people too. Everyone we know who has the Britax raves about how wonderful it is. It costs more, but I wish we had bought that one instead."
5,Excellent!,I love this car seat! It seems so comfortable for my 9 month old (he is 22lbs.). It also fits great in my PT Cruiser and my Nissan Titan.
3,Graco ComfortSport Car Seat,I started using the seat when my son was 7 months old. It worked great in a rear facing position. I tried facing him forward at 13 months and thought the seat sat up too straight in the upright position. He sleeps alot in the car so his headwould hang forward. I returned it and bought a Britax Roundabout that works great! It has a little recline in the upright position which suits us much better!
4,Graco Carseat,The carseat was given as a shower gift to my daughter. The seat is very well built. The only complaint by my daughter was thatthe warning label was placed in an area where the babies face would rub on it. The material isn't as soft as the seats material. We do realize the label is important but it could have been put in a different area.
1,Lot's of problems with this car seat,"The belts don't hold tight, always escaping the clip that is suppose to hold them together forcing removing the car seat to fix the problem. A major inconvinience. I had to duck tape the clip in the back to stop this problem...The security button (which releases the belts) is hold by two screws on plastic, which of course don't last usage making the plastic break around the screws making them loose."
2,unsafe,"This car seat is so so. I had bought it for my little girl because of the extra cushion and the fact that it was a Graco. Well, I returned it. The straps never seemed to work. I could get one side tight and the other side was really loose. No matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to work. Don;t buy it."
5,"Comfortable soft durable, great!","I would never use it for an infant as it is too upright but it was my son's toddler carseat, and it lasted until he needed a booster seat, it is extremely comfortable and the fabric is soft to the touch ( cover is easy to take off to wash) and of course it had a cupholder for his juice which easily detached for cleaning, also it has the latch system so it was really secure and safe, he loved it I loved it and will probably use it for his new sister when she is big enough."
4,Great Padding,"I hunted all over to get the padding I needed. We live 2 hours from town and wanted a comfy seat for our 4th baby. This certainly did the trick. It is everything it says it is, but I do wish the straps adjusted more easily like my evenflo triumph. However, I would purchase this one again if just for the padding in the seat."
1,Leather or Leatherette?,"I have had this case for my Handspring Visor for four months. After a short time, wear begins to show which makes me wonder if deed, is it leather or leatherette! The leather/leatherette veneer strap which attaches to the cover via velcro started to show cracks after 2 months. I would recommend the heavier leather case over this one. If you have a Visor, you'll know just how much use you get out of it so you may as well spend a little more and get the better leather case."
4,"A nice, dedicated case for the Handspring Visor.","I like this case. I like how the Visor just clips into it and doesn't require any Velco tape. The slots for credit cards, business cards, and money are very handy. The case isn't much larger than the Visor itself and is thin enough to fit into a back pocket, but you need to remember not to sit on it! If you're ever worried about the screen, you can insert the Visor in backwards and get extra protection from the plastic back (they've basically sewn the plastic cover that comes with the Visor into the case). The construction is very nice. My only major wish is that the Visor was completely sealed by the case. Three sides remain mostly exposed to the elements, so this case can't even be considered weather resistant."
2,broken screen,"I liked my case, but I thought it cost too much. It is kind of stiff when you first get it, and difficult to get the visor into, but this goes away after about a week. The reason I ranked this product so low is because it affords virtually no protection against falls. I believe that it is actually more susceptible to damage while in this case as opposed to the clip-on cover that comes with the visor. I had to replace my screen because I dropped it a meter in my local arby's."
2,I DON'T FIND THIS TO BE A WELL MADE CASE...,"I don't think it affords good protection for the screen. It visor snaps in solidly to the case but is somewhat difficult to get out (for modules etc). I dislike velco closures because then tend to end up looking ""tacky"" as things begin to attach themselves to it (fuzz, dust etc) It also doesnt look likea case that will last for a long time and I think I would have been better served by sepnding more and having it many times longer. Although I HAVE TO ADMIT THE CASE VISOR SENDS WITH THE DELUXE IS A DREADFUL SLIP-IN THING.... THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THAT BUT I WOULD STILL SAVE A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING MORE STURDY AND SOLID"
3,"A little tight, but the leather smells good","I like the way my Visor snaps into and out of the case. The only drawback with this method is that it does not work with my ""eyemodule"" digital camera attached because the camera lens is over the top of the unit where the leather case's clip fits.Even with no papers in the case's pockets, it feels a little tight around my Visor. I'd recommend a few millimetres more space to be really confortable. The new leather smalls classy though."
4,"Well made, good looking case","I've only had this case for a couple of months, so I won't comment on its long-term durability. I will say, however, that I've been pretty hard on this thing so far and it's standing up well. I had some concern about how well it would protect the screen of my Visor, so I slipped a credit card sized piece of plastic into the inside pocket and that firmed it up enough that I don't think I have anything to worry about. If you want something waterproof or solid enough to protect the Visor against major impact, buy something else. But if you want something that is well made, good looking and strong enough for average road warrior use, this is the case for you."
5,Nicely made -- very pleased,"Got my case a week ago, so I can't speak about how durable it is, but the Visor clips in easily and securely. The leather has a very nice look and feel. The velcro closure makes it easy to open and close.This case is only a smidgen thicker than the Visor in the leather slip case that comes with the Deluxe model. It fits OK in my front pants pocket, so I can have it with me whenever I want.I got it so I could easily access and use my Visor on-the-go, and it seems to be the perfect solution for this."
2,Good -- while it lasted,"I really enjoyed the easy access to my Visor Neo when I first got this case.That easy access (just flip it open) overcame what was a fairly major problem: If you really do put credit cards in the slots designed for them, they can protrude enough that I worried about scratching the screen of the Visor. I wound up putting only one or two business cards in there at a time.The biggest problem came the first time I dropped it. (No matter how non-clumsy you are, you WILL drop your PDA at some point.!!) The minute I did, the innovative pins at the bottom that allow the clip-in, clip-out retaining action snapped off cleanly, rendering the case absolutely useless.Why oh why couldn't Visor have designed a flip cover onto their PDA!?!?!?!?"
3,"Good for some, but not for me.","I purchased this case hoping it would serve ""double duty"" for me as a wallet and PDA case. While this would be great for anyone who uses a purse or attache case, it does not work for someone like me who wants a pocket sized PDA.This case is well designed, and serves its purpose well. As previously mentioned, I no longer use mine, simply because it adds too much bulkiness to the visor. ...I hope this helps!..."
3,The Raveonettes Fall Into The Sophomore Slump,"With a stellar first album under their bullet belts the Raveonettes decide to get a little more bold on their second album but get shot down in the process. Everyone knows who they sound like and that the first album was recording in one chord. But the reason why this album fails whereas the first one was brilliant is that they didn't do what the Strokes did and stick with their guns. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Obviously they can't keep making albums that are going to be recorded in one key like the first album but to go ahead and add a lot of stuff that really didn't need to be done was what did this album in. A lot more female lead vocals, surf rock, doo-wop, etc was a little too much and somehow made this album lose its edge. But believe me there is still hope with this group. Some of the stand-out songs are ""Love Can Destroy Everything"" and ""That Great Love Sound"". BRMC and JAMC might want to look into the this album ""CGOL""."
5,Beach Blanket Bammo,"If Gidget and Frankie got drunk, started to smoke and fooled around with premarital sex - all the while writing music for a new beach extravaganza, Chain Gang of Love is what the end result would be. Don't be fooled by the happy-go-lucky instrumentals, this is a dark, sugary-coated subversive album in all the right ways. Subverting modern rock conventions and looking for inspiration in the music of the 50s and 60s, the Raveonettes have succeded, yet again, in creating a powerful, memorable, beautifully kitschy album. More laid back than their driving debut Whip it On (also phenomenal), Chain Gang of Love explores similar themes but this time in B flat major. Worth every penny of the purchase price, the Raveonettes are definitely a musical force to be reckoned with given their innovative defiance of the modern rock scene and tongue in cheek playfulness."
2,The autopilot is working overtime,"When The Raveonettes first emerged with "" Whip It On "" they were this ice-cold cool band from Denmark , so good at writing gripping pop and rock songs most of which , if there was any justice in the world , would hit the top 5 . A few years letter and the Scandinavian duo are back with a more jolly and undeniably less exciting new album . Although there's nothing particulary wrong with any of the 13 tracks of Chain Gang Of Love , they all sound too similar with each other and only "" Little Animal "" and the tittle song slightly standing out . The group has obviously lost it's fierce , sharp character and doesn't seem to justify all the hype and the attention the media strangely deceided to give them now ."
4,I am putting in hair grease right now.,"Anyone ever see ""The Buddy Holly Story"" live. The stage production? Becuase in the end, he plays ""Rave On!"" (no connection) and it frickin' rocks. Like, hardcore kicks. When I saw that, I realized all the ""Golden Oldies"" we hear have been mixed all wrong for kids today. They keep the instumental low and the vocals high.Well, if Buddy Holly were alive to day, I'd like to think he'd be producing something like this. This CD reminds me, and I'm going to say this as nicely as I can, of Sunny Bono's ""I Fought The Law and The Law Won."" Fast, rocks, and fun. Plus, one of these tracks sounds a lot like ""Love, Rescue Me"" from the U2 ""Rattle and Hum"" record. This record is good all around. So quit downloading the singles, or you're going to miss the good stuff.And my new biker gang is meeting in the schoolyard later if anyone wants to join. Hopefully, someone can loan me a motorcycle."
2,Trying too Hard to be Retro,"This is a rather disconcerting mix of relatively decent sixties sound pieces and absolutely horrid songs that wouldn't make it in any era or style. There is considerable background noise on a number of songs, I think intentional. It reminds me of the hiss you get on a truly old vinyl album that has not been well cared for. Retro is good, but going retro that makes use of current sound technology is better."
2,...yawn...,"This is the end result of two boring and untalented people who reeeeally liked the Jesus and Marychain. In fact, this band could easily be described as a eunuch Jesus and Marychain. It's Jesus and Marychain de-balled. This is the kind of album they blast in stores like American Eagle and Abercrombie and Fitch, or at least play a song from it in one of their gaggy pseudo-hip commercials. If you like that sort of thing, then hey, go for it. Put it next to the other albums in your collection that Seventeen magazine said were hip."
1,Chain Gang of Bad Music,"Yes they sound like the Jesus and Mary Chain, but are not even one percent as good. Boring melodies. Plain harmonies. Terrible lyrics. Guitars sound like they were recorded through cheap headphones - no body or bite. This is the new rock and roll? Count me out."
2,Terrible,"This album is completely derivative and--worse--it's extremely boring. This band has some awesome influences, but the music they make (at least on this album) is neither their own, nor is it anywhere near being as good as the sounds that they are emulating. All of these songs sound the same, and the lyrics are completely uninspired. I got this album for free from a friend who hated it, and after a few painful listens, I passed it on to another friend. If you want to hear something that sounds like the Everly Brothers or the Jesus & Mary Chain, listen to those bands. If you want to hear something new that sounds retro, you're better off checking out any of the hundreds of other retro-sounding bands that are actually putting out interesting music."
4,4stars,"To me I felt certain songs gave off a California sound, and wouldve felt right at home in the early 60s, but with cunning originality to bring it up into the new millenium.I liked this one."
4,It'll be 20 years before you hear this sound again.,"This is easily the most gimmicky band since the White Stripes. All songs in one key, no longer than three minutes etc... That said this, and their EP, sound exactly like Jesus and Mary Chain's 1985 classic, Psychocandy. It is no coincidence that it took nearly 20 years for the sound to be duplicated. It is so one-dimensional that it takes only two or so albums to completely exhaust the formula. The Jesus and Mary Chain never duplicated the beauty and ferocity of that first album, except maybe on a few tracks on The Darklands. So, it seems new if you've forgotten JAMC, but alas though beautiful, it's an old style. I don't mean to discourage anyone from buying or listening to the album because it sounds like warm honey and a rainy day beer buzz. So, listen and enjoy but don't forget where this album came from. This sound won't reappear for another 20 years."
2,Big Let Down,"I loved ""Whip It On"". I thought it was brilliant. ""Chain Gang"" fell short of my expectations. I won't delve into the trivial ""they sound like Jesus and Mary Chain"" chatter, because they don't. I kinda wish they did. This album sounds like they cleaned up for the music industry. It also sounds like they threw a bunch of songs together in a hurry. The guitar work is not as innovative. Maybe they got off of heroin or something. Sort of sounds like it. I give it 2 out of 5 stars, where Whip It On got 4. Save your money, or buy some classic stuff. And if you haven't heard them, give Jesus and Mary Chain a shot. You can usually find them in the bargain bin at your local used cd store."
3,Rave on.,"When I first listened to this album, I thought, why didn't they just call themselves ""The Buddy Holly And Mary Chain""? However, regardless of who they sound like, they sound good. I'm not sure yet if I like this more than ""Whip It On"", but it's definitely sunnier, and longer. The songs tend to all sound the same, but maybe that's the point. Nothing really stands out, even though the album as a whole is good. They also seem a bit gimmicky, like another band i know, but as long as they both rock, that's what's important."
2,Nothing to Rave About,"The Raveonettes are nothing to Rave about. You can get the same effect by playing scratched beach music records from the 50s and 60s that you'd find in a second hand store. So what is the point to pretentiously create a low-fidelity sound in modern times? Marketing tactics using beatnick nostalgic packaging and hyped ads in the music magazines do not guarantee quality. And yes, they do sound like bad Jesus and Mary Chain! (And Jesus and Mary Chain was b-a-a-a-a-d) I think the vote is out on this one folks. Future bargain bin material at used CD stores!!"
1,Ugh...,"i bought this cd after hearing Attack of the Ghost Riders and Beat City... song off of their first cd. I instantly fell in love and decided to buy this mindless junk. when i popped this cd into my cd player, I was embarassed to have bought such a bad cd. Honestly. I couldn't stand it. The singing sounds lame and makes me want to gag. They have changed their style its less hard than before. I just couldn't stand it. So its now in the used rack at my record store. Awfully annoying cd. Download all the songs first. Don't listen to these rave reviews they mean nothing. Theres so many better bands out there right now. If you want something innovative and fresh check out Tv on the Radio and !!!. SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!"
4,Our gallant triad is in trouble - again!,"This episode is obviously from late in the series when the formulaic Kirk/Spock/McCoy trio or any combination thereof, go downplanet and immediately find a whole heap o'trouble. In this case Kirk goes back to a Salem-esque era and Spock and Bones go back to the Ice Age. But the plot works, mostly due to the interplay of the Spock/McCoy characters. Look for the Tollhouse Cookie Girl in the role of the scantily clad Zarabeth, Spock's love interest."
3,A Personal Choice,"Yes, I am a movie, music scholar, but I am ordering this because a dear person and actress in Encino California, by the name of Anna Karen who played one of the ""Sarpeidon Morts"". I haven't seen or heard from Anna since 1992! Anna if you are out there, give me a shout.I heard William Shatner on a radio interview recently- pushing his new autobiography and he stayed away from the Star Trek thing because he has to PR new material but he does let acute observations slip if you listen. A classic one was him musing (06/08) ""...yes and did I really have that jawline when I was 25...?""These old VHS are great to own without commercials. They still look good in a world of digital smears of computer graphics. Back in 1966, when Special Effects meant Model making of spacecraft.Thanks, Amazon."
1,Defective and annoying,60 Minutes needs to learn how to make a DVD. It doesn't even work on a computer. Frustrating and useless. Do not buy their DVD products.
2,Teacher,"I thought when I bought this video it was the whole 60 minute special on the MS 13 gang, but in reality it was 13 minutes. It was so not worth the money to buy this video for 13 minutes. I was pretty disappointed in the movie. I guess I didn't realize how short it was, but buy another video on MS 13, and not this one."
3,TV Game Show Themes,"This album definitely has novelty value and would be good for a die-hard game show fan, but I can't picture listening to it all the way through for pure entertainment. I also think some of the recordings had poor sound."
5,For Game show fanatics,"Do you or somebody you love like old and new game shows? Do you watch ""Game Show Network"" the way some folks watch ""Friends""?If so, this cd is perfect for you.This has some of the older themes (""I Got A Secret"") as well as newer ones (""The Newlywed Game"") and lots inbetween. You'll find much to enjoy if you're a fan of old tv shows and game shows in particular. So if that description fits you or somebody you love, buy it - you'll be the big winner."
5,"I CAN'T WAIT FOR VOLUME 2, TOO!","If you are a game show connoisseur, you are going to enjoy this CD immensely. The original themes from the classics really conjure up great memories, indeed. You will be hardpressed to find anything of its kind anywhere else. So, ""Come on down!"" and Order Your Copy Today!"
5,Come On Down!!,We used this CD for an event where Chuck Woolery was the keynote speaker. Great energy as people registered. A few were singing along. It's short but has all the classics.
4,Mister Consistency,"It is amazing how consistently great Johnny Hodges sounded throughout his long career. Although these recordings occurred just 3 years before his death, Mr. Hodges provides excellent solos, as do many of his Ellington band mates. Everybody Knows is my favorite Hodges CD, but this disc is a close second."
5,This is a book that really can reach your heart.,"I use this book in my classroom where I work with kids who have ADHD and other learning diabilities. I first discovered this book while searching for another by the same author. My daughter and I sat in the floor and read it. She is a child who has never felt like she fits in. She said that Fondo was like her. When Fondo miraculously finds his place in life I told her that all of us have a place in this world, it just takes some of us longer to find it. The other day I read this book to my class, sharing the same message with them. I noticed a girl crying afterwards. She raised her hand and said, ""This book tells me that there is hope for me. I can belong somewhere."" Now, there is no way that the kids in my class see her as they did before. They have reached out to her. This book has an important message for us all."
1,ACE,"Awful, do not buy this CD but service was awesome gave me a full refund!The songs all but one were off key and I would never have thought this to be the case!"
2,As soulful as Wayne Newton,"Ace came on the U S music scene about 1975 with a knock-out blue-eyed soul hit tilted `How Long.' The single had sweet harmony vocals, a bluesy lead guitar and an unforgettable underlining bass hook. The infectious formula was repeated again with success on `Why.' Also, `Sniffin' About' is a hard driving number that's certain to get you on your feet and shaking your booty (on whatever it's called this year). Unfortunately, the three mentioned numbers are this only ones worth notice. Ace is a group of talented musicians, but they lack the ability to create music with urgency. The remaining cuts on this CD are about as soulful as Wayne Newton."
2,How Long? Too Long.,"Ace are generally considered a Pub band, though it isn't clear why. They are really just a typical seventies soft rock band like the Doobie Brothers. In addition to creating the classic rock staple tune `Hold On' they are known as the springboard for ubiquitous mediocrity Paul Carrack, who spread his particular brand of blandness in later years through bands like Squeeze and Mike And The Mechanics (he also, tragically, released a series of solo albums that I have thankfully never heard). Though this is a `best of' collection, there is little to recommend here, `Rock N Roll Runaway' is an ok track, but hardly worth the price of admission. The rest of the tunes (including the disappointingly overplayed `How Long') are innocuous at best, more often, they are grating. Fans of schlock pop bands like Fleetwood Mac or Phil Collins may enjoy the disc, but why not simply buy another Huey Lewis album?"
5,"Extension Turntable Slide for DLP 65"" TV","I bought this extension slide to support my Mitsubishi 65"" DLP TV (75-80 lbs). Since the TV is not a flat screen; I needed some way to get to the connections on the back of the TV located in a built-in cabinet. The carpenter had built a slide that would work fine for drawers; but not for a TV this size. This solution works perfectly, with the additional bonus of rotating up to 180 degrees."
5,Slideout swivel for 50 inch vizio,This item did the trick. I was faced with spending a considerable amount of money to have TV mounted above fireplace but this solved the problem
4,solid hardware,"i wanted to continue to utilize my entertainment center which had been designed for a crt tv (picture tube.) unfortunately, the new flat panel needed to sit outside of the box so that it was viewable by everyone. 225 pounds was more than adequate to hold a 37 in. tv. the product was easily attached to my entertainment center, probably requiring 30 minutes of drilling, screwing, etc. kind of spendy, but a quality piece of hardware."
2,Not Great,"Don't expect too much from this flashlight. I wasn't very impressed, there are way better products for a better price."
1,Don't waste your money,"I own the Streamlight Stinger/rechargeable with the regular 25,000 candlepower (CP) lens. I then bought the 40,000 CP adapter ($35.00) to improve the performance and increase the power of my Stinger. I was disappointed immediatelly: the additional 15,000 CP that came with the new broad head lens and the new larger bulb seem to be almost unnoticeable. No one I worked with could tell the difference. Also, the light seems to wear out faster (low runtime) and tended to shine in a more yellow hue which is less effective than the white hue of most high performance lights. By adding the new broad head adapter lens and larger bulb my Stinger became an HP, but in the end I, as well as others, noticed it was not any better and probably not as efficient."
2,Not as good as Duracell,"I bought these to use in my newborns swing. They lasted less than two weeks. I bought the eight pack of Duracell and they lasted almost twice as long. This is not worth the money. Plus if you get the subscribe and save of the Duracell, it comes out to almost the same price per battery. Don't waste your money on these."
4,Dependable!,I bought these batteries for everyday use in my flashlights and also as a backup to items needed during a power outage. So far they have worked out great! I would reoommend these batteries highly.
5,Rayovac battery review,"Batteries work as expected,received in sealed plastic containers with no damage.I placed the order in July after hurricane Irene, all stores were sold out.I was originally told the order will not come until October, but was happy to here that the order will be received earlier than expected. Good batteries at a respectably low price. Would purchase again."
1,LEAKING BATTERIES,"I sent these to my child at sleepaway camp, and when she opened the batteries, they were leaking battery acid and the acid cut her finger! Not good."
5,GREAT PRICE!!,"I haven't had to use the batteries yet, but, I'm so glad to get them as a great price and free S&H. I'm getting stocked up on batteries."
2,rayovac ald-13 ultrapro,"I have an automatic wastecan and the battery took more than one week to work. I though that it was something wrong with my can, but it was the battery because it started to work a few days ago."
5,Rayovac Alkaline UltraPro D Batteries,Batteries came quickly through Amazon Subscribe & Save. Date of expiration is 2018. Rayovac Alkaline batteries have for many years been rated at the top when it comes to battery life. Very satisfied with my purchase and they come in a plastic container that you can use to store your D batteries.
2,These are basically crap,3 or 4 of these were dead out of the box. The rest died within a couple months of light use. I would not buy these again.
4,Work fine- don't see a difference from bigger brand names,"I haven't done any real comparison with these vs. other brands, but they seem to be lasting quite a long time in our baby's swing, so no complaints here."
1,They Leak,"I have found, as several others have, that Rayovac batteries are more prone to leak than any of the other major alkaline brands. I've had to throw away 2 Mag-Lite flashlights as a result. I was able to save a third which was still lighting, but I opened it just to check the batteries which appeared a little weak. Just in time! The Rayovac batteries were leaking, but I was able to clean it up and save the flashlight.Stick with Eveready or Duracell. Best are Eveready Gold, followed by Duracell, then Eveready Energizer. All are excellent batteries. The Eveready Gold cost a little more, but they last longer, so in the end the cost is about the same."
5,What a deal!,Batteries are so expensive these days! Amazon was the only place I could find a bulk set of batteries for so little!
3,Good Enough,"Batteries are "" Just Good Enough "" for the price.They beat rechargeable batteries when you have a house full of kids needing new batteries all the time, and for the price, they are just good enough.However, don't compare these Alkaline Batteries to Duracell or Energizer Alkaline Batteries, if you do you will be disappointed."
3,Not great,We use these in our baby swing. They lasted about 2 weeks which is not good. Typically the Duracells we use get about 6 weeks of use before they wear out.
4,No Problems Yet,"Haven't had a problem yet with these. But I will revise if I notice anything going wrong. Used them in my 3 battery maglite, and it's been bright (though I only use it occasionally)."
4,Fast shipment,I like the easy open container. The exp date on each battery is dec. 2018 - which is fine with me. May order more. Good.
4,Batteries,"They are batteries. They have charge. They are cheap. What else do you want? You want six more words, apparently."
5,Rayovac D Batteries,Long Lasting batteries. Easy to install and replaceUsefull for many objects requiring heavy dutybatteries. Reliable and useful named product.
2,Very disappointed,"I got this on the basis of the reviews here, but wish I had not. It is very amateurishly written, and the dialogue is painfully bad. ""You are my woman!"" ""I am not your woman!"" ""It is true!"" ""No it is not!"" over and over. But then they are declaring their love for one another in just a couple of days, which is just not realistic. The only reason I gave it two stars is because there is a lot of historical detail that is interesting, and the author obviously did a great deal of research. Too bad she is such a mediocre writer. I will not be reading any more of her books."
5,check out the mods,"this game is good on it's own but the Desert Combat mode is why this game is soo awsome.it's it has jets,hummers,and some maps have there own vehicles.and a star wars mod called glactic conquest.check it out at ..."
3,"Good Expansion, but low value for the money","This expansion, is good, don't get me wrong. But it seems very lacking. There are very few things which are actually new.It just feels like it wasn't completed, every new map seems easily recreated if there were a map editor. And most of the weapons and vehicles, while true to their history, seems gameplay-wise, a remodelled version of what was already there.They also did not see fit to add in any sort of single-player campaign option for the new maps.Overall it's pretty good, it does expand the map repertoire of the best multiplayer game available, but it just leaves you thinking they should've done more for the $..."
3,"Quality...Tsk, Tsk","First of all, the episodes on this volume were great. It's the quality that upsets me. The first episode (""Mork's First Christmas"") was in pretty good condition, but the second episode (""Mork Goes Erk"") was in REALLY bad condition! I'd rather get these episodes from someone who taped them off Nick at Nite or from the Canadian Comedy Channel."
4,Pretty nice option,"This works very well in monitoring my RV batteries. Its nice to have percentage, hours remaining base off load and current load. Its helpful to me however seems expensive for what it provides. I could see this costing about $100 for the value it provides.Would buy it again though as I cannot find a better alternative."
4,Very informative,"There's a lot of information in this book. The author not only explains every step of drying/seasoning wood, but explains why in great detail. Just about every aspect of drying/seasoning is backed up with noted research and references. Theres also great instructions on building a solar kiln, which I indent to use.This is a great read to anyone wishing to convert timber into lumber.I rated this book at four stars only because it is a bit dated, but still worth every penny..."
4,an unexpected gem,"This album has a lot of appealing qualities: It's both introspective and arresting; a slowed-down, tripped-out soundscape. Baxter Dury croons with confidence, aided by some hauntingly lush female vocals on many of the tracks. It sounds like Portishead through an aural kaleidoscope. It's a distant, dreamy record, perfect for weekend mornings and quiet nights."
3,low liftoff,"a very nice mellow album with fragile whispery melodies that float along a bed of light and airy music. while this album is not what i would consider a timeless masterpiece, it's still a pretty solid record and a recommendation for fans of The Clientele and the Out Of Season album by Beth Gibbons and Rustin' Man."
2,Battery life,Very bright - easy to handle - much smaller than I originally thought.Battery life has been horrendous. Barely lasts more than 2 days of on/off continuous work
2,Could be better,I'd imagine most microbiology courses for biology or science majors is going to require knowledge at a much higher level than what is on here. So maybe it would be good for a basic introductory course but for most it won't help and your time would be spent on better material.
4,Good Reference,This book is a good reference sourse for the Microbiology course. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,Decent,"These crackers are average, though it can be a bit salty/sweet due to the uneven coating. They make a spicy version of these, I prefer those more."
3,"So so, tasty but not great","These are ok, but nothing special. They go well with tea if you want something crunchy, but they lack flavor and aren't very healthy."
4,"A perfect narrative voice, a nice story","The story of Suse's adolescence during WWII years is interesting, entertaining, fun, though it's hardly compelling. But the voice! Leffland created and captured an entirely believable character, and as Suse matured--along with the war--the voice changed, grew, matured. Yet is was always Suse. The book's a real piece of art."
4,excellent,"Rumors of Peace follows the thoughts of a young girl whose sheltered world is broken by war, even as she watches it from afar. It is no less close to her heart though as she anxiously follows the news reports and school gossip. This girl is Suse Hansen. Over the course of four years we live with her as she grows in both her mind and her body. From an innocent eleven year old tomboy to a moral young woman, Suse captures the hearts of her readers with her perceptions and unfolding knowledge. Thirty miles east of San Francisco, the setting is Mendoza, a small oil-refining town. I have read no other book like Rumors of Peace; its subtlety and careful descriptions are unique and could be read again and again."
3,Little story for such a long book,"The story of a maturing girl provides many stereotypical events of growing up. The reason I rated this book three stars is because it really isn't a book written for males. I am sure that young women would enjoy this story much more than I did. The story is set in the times of WWII, beginning when Suse is in elementary school. She has a brother who is put in the war and a sister who soon goes away to college. Without her siblings she goes through the adolescent type events involving friendship, puberty, love, and middle school. These stories of maturing related little to me being a male. Still in my view this was a decent book to read as the voice of Suse's feelings captures you regardless of your sex. However, I would still only recommend this book to younger girls."
2,"Historical interesting, that's about it","I like the book in terms of it's historical reference. We read about how the news media really was during WWII, and how propaganda works with young people. The trials and tribulation of Suse during those tender teenage years isn't really all that different compared to what teenage girls go through now."
2,Well . . .,"This book lacked the ability to captivate the reader. The plot is dull, the style is not boring but a bit tedious to go through. But perhaps being forced to read this book would take away from its delights. I found the protagonist's coming-of-age quite cliche. All-in-all, it had it's moments, but failed to keep the reader interested."
2,ITs not really good or bad just long !,"I laughed, I cryed, I fell asleep. This book is an increadably detailed look into the life of a small girl growing up in the Bay area durring the early years of world war 2."
2,Long and to detailed,"The story could have been cut in half, it was to long and to slow. It was full of unnecessary details that I found myself wondering if I'd ever finish. There were only a few parts of the book that I really did enjoy."
3,good php security book but not clear at times,"It is a good book, in mu opinion, but not a great one. The author was not clear at times at all and/or was much too terse. One may have to use this book in conjunction with some internet research in order to go over the concepts that were not so well explained. Overall, the book does serve its purpose, which is, i believe, to give a very good overview of the PHP and PHP related security issues, as well as to provide recommendations how to make a PHp application 'more secure'."
1,Overpriced,"Of the 103 pages in the book there are probably only 13 of unique information and 90 pages of saying the same exact thing over and over again. Worse yet, I found the author had already released the 13 pages of useful information online for free.Definitely wish I had browsed this one in a store before I blew $30."
3,Not Bad,"This handy book fecth most recent popular attacks, and roughly coveres most general attacking means and how to secure your website.I like author's princle about how to filter tainted input and his code snippets are short and understandable.But this book comes with quite much minor errors; chapters seem little bit repetitive and redundant and most codes are not talked in depth.If you were a php newbie, and wish to know more php security related features or you want a short, handy cookbook which provides a quick reference, you should pick up this book."
3,Redundant and really basic tips,"This 120 page book could be condensed into one chapter. Most of the examples are just applying the same filter and escape your data to different function.This book should be read by new programmers. If you have been programming for any decent amount of time, you should already know everything in here."
3,Should not be sold as new,"While the content of the book was very helpful and informative, the pages are yellow with age. It has a copyright date of 2006 and I suspect that it sat on a shelf or in a warehouse since then. This item should have been sold as used due to its weathered condition."
4,Common threats handled,"Good overview of common threats on web applications, that are handled specifically in php. The author often repeats one of the arguments, but this one is actually the central thing so it's fine to repeat it until we really memorize it."
3,Tantalizes but doesn't deliver,"I bought this book becuase it appeared to follow the precepts and structure of Narrative therapy, with special attention given to the re-authoring and externalizing processes, areas that I see as important in the field of pastoral care. However, it has little to do with Narrative work, but rather seems to embrace traditional pastoral care practices mingled with standard material from other mental health disciplines, and I have thus come away feeling dissapointed. The verbatim material is also rather scant. I would still like to see a piece that genuinely integrates the Bible into the re-authoring process."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"This is a must for any Britney fan Track Listings w/ brief description:1. Oops! I Did It Again- this is the original version. Upbeat, playing, and lots of leading on. This song is about a girl that has all the guys falling for her (including me!), but she does nothing more than ""play with their hearts""2. Oops! I Did It Again (Instrumental)- I should hope I don't have to explain this. This is great for testing your singing ability in the shower!3. From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart (Funky Remix)- this is really cool. Its an upbeat version of From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart. The best way to explain it is the lyrics of From the Bottom Of My Broken Heart combined with the heavy beat of Crazy.4. Deep In My Heart- this song has never been released in the US. IT is jumpy and has a touch of electrical sound in it. Totally different from all of Britney's other songs.THIS CD IS AWSOME- PLUS IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT AN OOPS! SINGLE WILL BE RELEASED IN THE US! ANY FAN SHOULD BUY THIS!"
4,Great Import!,"This Import Single is great. ""Oops!...I Did It Again"" is a wonderful song to dance to and get jiggy with, probably Britney's best song to date. The instrumental version is nice if you can sing well and is also good music for if you are having a party. ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart""- Ospina's Millennium Funk Mix is a good song to chill out and ""Deep In My Heart"" is an OK song by Britney but not one of her best. Overall, a great CD!"
1,"0ops we hit an iceberg, get out the lifeboats.","Sorry Britney but this one sunk!The only reason I would have bought this cd would have been if I did not have ""Deep In My Heart"" or the remix of From The Bottom Of My Heart. If I want to hear something like this I'll listen to Baby One More Time, this song sounds simular to Britney's first hit and that cheesy and corny ""Titanic interlude"" made this song sink faster than that famous ship."
5,A must-have,"Here are the ratings out of 5:1. Album Version (5 Stars) I'm sure you've heard it. Catchy, pure pop by Rami and Max Martin.2. Instrumental (5 Stars) Once you learn it, you can sing along! It's hard to sing like Britney. If you listen to it without trying to sing, it's pretty nice to hear.3. From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart (Ospina's Millenium Funk Mix) (5 Stars) How long can a title be? It really picks up the tempo to make it a dance song! I think he did an excellent job remixing!4. Deep In My Heart (5 Stars) I think it's the best cut off of Baby One More Time. If you haven't heard this you HAVE to!I'm sorry if I was too brief! This is an excellent single to own!"
5,Oops I Fell In Love With This Cd,"i love this cd i just got this cd in my mailbox 10 minutes ago and it's great .This is the 4 track cd single ""oops"" - ( album version + instumental ) , A remix of ""from the bottom of my broken heart"" , and a new song ""Deep in my heart"" which comes as a bonus track on the european Baby one more time Album"
5,Great Stroller,"I bought this stroller at the request of my other children, as they liked the look of this one (color). I have a 2 year old and three more. I wanted a jogging stroller to go to baseball games,to parks and for walks around town.I had read reviews and was a little unsure about this stroller, because some people had issues with the front wheel, but most people said to tighten the large bolt on the top of the wheel and that then the problem went away. We tightened the bolt when we set up the stroller and the stroller is just purfect. All my children love it, they ride is very smooth, it is a breeze to push, and it glides over everything. Great stroller for the money, would buy again. Colors are also nice pink and a meduim grey. Does not fold up small, but no jogging stroller does."
2,Shaky jogger,"We have the baby trend jogger (green not pick) but basically the same.The front wheel has shaken since buying.I've tried the recommended tightening of the lock nut, but it comes loose very quickly. Unless at exactly the right tension the wheel shakes frighteningly or is too stiff for maneuver. If you are running shaking can start suddenly enough to make you fall over and give your baby a big shock.The locking position sets the wheel in place but makes the jogger so difficult to change direction it's of little use.The help line is useless. They had me on hold until hanging up, several times.The lock nut finally fell off and we will try and install our own with locking ring, together with now missing bearings.I would recommend people don't buy this until they fix the issue."
3,Much better than expected,"Despite the lukewarm reviews, and maybe because I've never heard of the book it's based on, I thought this movie was a real hoot. Widmark, Mitchum and especially Douglas ham it up pretty good but that just adds to the fun of this sprawling epic about pioneer settlers determined to make it to Oregon. It's fun to see Widmark playing against type as a boozy, happy-go-lucky farmer with a beautiful wife and a serious case of wanderlust and Mitchum hilariously underplays his role as the requisite indian-wannabee trail guide, but this is Kirk's show through and through. He plays the hard edged ruthless tycoon, determined to reach Oregon at all costs so that he can fulfill his dream of empire building and it's always a delight to see him going fullstop, as he does here. Sally Field plays a raunchy southern girl too, a character that seems a bit daring for the times. Not a great western by any means, but a very entertaining flick and a worthy addition to any classic film library."
3,Way West,Entertaining western that was enjoyable. The widescreen print was very good with clarity and bright color. If you enjoy a good western this is a good choice. Amazon delivery was quick and I recieved it on the date stated. C6
5,The Way West,"Good old fashioned wagon train heads WEST to America's manifest destiny. Great cast, great script, and wonderful country this was filmed in. This is the way Westerns are meant to be made.Too bad Hollywood doesn't makes films the this anymore. They would sell FAR, FAR, FAR better than anything with Herr Scientological Fuhrer Cruise-O-Whackjob! (MY OPINION OF HIM! Talented but NOT as talented as he thinks he is! Or is credited as being! By his age Charleton Heston had several Oscar nominations along with several OSCARS and same goes for John Wayne.)I bet they could do a CGI based Western inserting John Wayne, Dean Martin, Robert Mitchum, Jimmy Stewart, and few others and rock the box office with only one other ""LIVE"" main character of no famous significance. It's proven the even 20+ years dead John Wayne STILL out performs most of today's so called stars by being number 7 in DVD income!Hmmm."
1,Sad effort,"Don't be fooled by the cast. This film is a big letdown for anyone who has enjoyed reading A. B. Guthrie's stirring stories of the West. The dialogue is atrocious. The script tries to rush through six months of the trail in 2 hours. But, most disappointingly, the film makers tinkered too much with the wonderful story. Don't do it!"
1,The Biggest Waste Of Panavision Stock Ever.,"This is an absolutely horrible film. More so than any Western I've ever seen, I've never been so conscience that I was watching a poorly directed Hollywood-cliché ridden farce. EVERYONE walks through their roles (and I am a fan of all three lead actors) no doubt because they know that the script is childish, pretentious, and just plain stupid. ""The Big Trail"" is twice the film this is.""Glory be"" ""this'n"" ""ain't a-worth-a"" watchin' ""a'tall""!"
1,Not true to the book.,"Having just finished reading the book, I am horribly disappointed with the movie. I guarantee if you liked the book you will not like the movie. Robert Mitchum as Dick Summers was a good casting choice and that's maybe the only positive thing I can say. Had it stayed truer to the book it would have been a better movie."
5,Great Actors,"This movie is one that I watched with my father, when I was young and enjoyed it very much."
4,Nice case,Rather larger then I thought it would be. The leather is not as good a quality as my previous case. Over all it is a good case & will be good protection for computer.
1,Does Not Wear Well,"The wallet could have been a great product. Unfortunately, it is one of the only ones with the bracket that locks the Visor in. BEWARE: the credit card and license slot pockets RIP after ONE MONTH of steady use! If you use your cards a lot (like I do), you will need a new wallet after a month, or else worry that a loose credit card will fall out when you least expect it. Also, as with the Visor, THERE IS NO WARRANTY, AND THEY WON'T TAKE IT BACK. It's an INFERIOR product."
3,Doesn't work with visorphone,"This is a great case...but it doesn't work if you have a springboard module that adds any depth to your Handspring. The visorphone's battery protrudes from the back of the handheld, and makes it impossible for it to click in to the holder in this case. I have a brand new one in the box if anyone's interested. :-P"
4,A mistitled but informative and fun cultural study,"Let's get this straight right off the bat: Daniel Pool's book is purposefully mistitled to make you think that it would be a sequel of sorts to his extremely useful and popular compendium of facts important to Victorian fiction WHAT CHARLES DICKENS ATE AND JANE AUSTEN KNEW. This book is very different: it reads like a straightforward narrative, and it's an enjoyable, gossipy, and onformative account of the demands of the publishing market in the mid-Victorian world of the novel, and how it created the careers of Dickens, the Bronts, Trollope, Thackeray, George Eliot, etc. The mistitling (undoubtedly to make the book sell better) is thus quite appropriate, in that the novel helpfully etails the ways in which publishing conventions of the time (the rise of Mudie's lending library, the convention of the three-decker) made and shaped literary careers."
4,Another great CD from Richard Stoltzman,"This is another great CD from Richard Stoltzman. Pie Jesu is just great, and the title cut, New York Counterpoint, should not be missed. It is one of Steve Reich's better compositions, in my opinion, and works very well here."
5,hard core light,"This a 'bad boy' light. It is quite bright, and lasts a long time on a charge. It is heavy, but you can set it down and adjust the swivel head. Yes, this light is used by many fire deptments. if you want a light that will last and last on a single charge this is the way to go. Sure it's over a hundred bucks, but this light is a serious tool, and will last for years and years. My battery just gave out, (after about 7 years) and I got a replacement for under $20. If you like high quality, hardcore stuff, this light will not let you down"
2,Hope it's been improved since I bought it....,"The design has great potential, the tilt head, you can use this hands-free, butthe halogen lamp did not produce an even or powerful beam. It is not properly matched to the mirror.Furthermore the focus of the beam can not be adjusted, you are told to disassemble itand try to move the lamp holder, this does not improve anything. The lens cover is alsoeasily scratched plastic.With a proper bulb mirror and lens this would be lovely, perhaps an LED version is available now?"
2,Should have purchased the one from Orion Publishing Group,"Pros: all four books of the discourses are included, with a table of contents.Cons: everything else. That is to say, the text is present, with headings for subsections. However, there is no numbering, which makes navigation very difficult. There is no mention of a translator. No critical introduction. This book is the equivalent of an online text with no source references. It merely saves you the trouble of printing off a few hundred pages. For the price, one would certainly do better to buy a copy of Orion's edition."
1,Epictetus is great: This book isn't,"I have wanted to own a copy of the Discourses for several years. I finally decided to buy one. I picked this one because it was the cheapest. Big mistake. It is absolutely riddled with typos and misspellings. It is very difficult to read. Only the wisdom of Epictetus keeps me from tossing this copy in the trash. I couldn't even find an editor or a translator listed for the copy. ""NuVision"" publishing seems to be a pretty sorry operation. Just try buying the Discourses from one of the reputable publishers further down the list."
1,SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE EDITING!!!!! AVOID!,"There's bad editing and then there's simply no editing. After about the 5th page there are typos and further problems within this text which make it virtually unreadable.Utterly outrageous... I originally purchased this for a friend for Christmas, but now will need to return it and be without a gift!!The publishers have obviously no interest whatsoever in providing quality content.This isn't just lazy - it's downright disrespectful."
1,Worst album ever,"I have over 500 Metal albums and this is by far the worst purchase I have ever made. In one word this album ""Blows!"" First of all these guys have never heard of rythym, all their riffs are boring as hell, they label themselves as Gothenbeg metal, but they are absolutely nothing like At the Gates. None of the tracks are worth a listening to, this album ranks on my list below Metallica's ""Reload"" and Moonspell's ""Irreligious"". Why metal blade signed this crap I will never know. If you want A good black metal album buy something from Emperor, Immortal, or Dimmu Borgir And don't make the samew mistake that I made When I bought this CD."
5,Stop Me If You've Heard This One Before...,"Very interesting ""documentary"" about a serial-murdering stand-up comedian. We are taken along as he goes through his routines, both on the stage and while creeping up on his latest victims. Extremely black humour sure to please funny-boned sadists or those w/ a warped sense of hilarity (like me). This low-low-budget, B+W gem is also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES..."
1,New to Bill Brooks,This is my first book by Bill Brooks and probably..my last. It started out good but as soon as the cheap sex scenes started I lost interest and put it down... some pretty graphic for a western..To me these have no place in a western novel..but that's just me If you like that sort of stuff I that's fine. OK. I have read many westerns and don't see very much use of the f word. There is simple no need for itI would like to read something else by this author that does not contain raw sex stuff..if is a available??Bill has a good reputation for westerns so some of them have to be better than this..
4,Simple Tools for Effective Presentations,"This book is the guide I wish I had had years ago. I made many formal and informal presentations with little training in how to make them truly effective. Presentation training often focuses on the technical aspects of a good presentation, while what one really needs is the ability to make one's message resonate with and engage the audience. This book helps you to do just that. I find the book helpful and full of constructive points. It is written in a simple, straightforward way and is easy to use. I keep with me and refer to it in advance of important presentations - formal or informal."
2,Underwhelming,"Not that easy to use. Doesn't do landscape architecture well at all. Mainly just for construction. Not hard to use, but not easy either. I bought it used. I recommend that if you buy it, you get it used too. Can't see paying full retail price for this. There have got to be better packages out there"
1,Helpful only in designing boxes with roofs,"This product was a horrible waste of my money.There is no option for log houses, which I find surprising. This is afterall, far from an alternative building style.It seems as though this product was made for those with little or no creaativity, seeking to create another ugly box like all those that already exist all over the nation.Don't waste your money!"
1,bad movie,bad movie save your money... was not worth the time duded plot sucked...bad movie total crap not at all fun or scary
3,good for limited use,Pros: The Scorpion's small compact size and light weight construction make this a good high powered light. The rubber grip is a plus when operating in wet conditions.Cons: Although the batteries have a reported 5 year shelf life they only last for 1 hour of continued use and the batteries are very expensive for there use.I recommend this light for in your car or anywhere there is limited use and you have a need for it to sit for long periods between uses.
4,good light,"very good light for the money, waterproof housing and very bright bulb, but they don't last very long. not to be used as a everyday light, more for emergency."
2,Junk stream light,"This product is not the greatest, the batteries that came with it only lasted a couple days. I replaced the batteries and the new ones did the same, so I am not impressed or nor will I purchase another flash light made by this company."
1,what a piece of junk!!!!,"I had my Scorpian 85001 for about 10 days before it stopped working... good batteries, good bulb, bad switch, tring to repair it and the bulb then fell into the front compartment behind the lenz?... good luck tring to get it out of there?... all and all a very disappointing situation, I need and use a reliable flashlite every working day, so I guess I'll go back to my old reliable mini mag. $[...] bucks down the toilet..."
2,Didn't Work,"I gave this product 2 stars because, according to other reviews, it works for most people. But mine was missing the necessary switch and extra bulb (not that it was needed without the switch). Luckily I bought it from Amazon so the return process was simple. Also, I read the directions and apparently the light will only work to its full potential for 1 hour, after that the lighting power will diminish and those batteries are not cheap. I was not able to witness this first hand but it's right there in writing from Streamlight."
1,Disappointed song versions were not the popular ones.,"I asked my wife ""who sings 'Close To You'?"". Easy question, the Carpenters. Not on this CD, it's Andy Williams. ""Do You Know The Way To San Jose"" is a piano instrumental, no horns, no lyrics. With a few exceptions, the artists I associate with my favorite Bacharach songs were not on this CD. When you've grown up with certain artists in mind for certain songs it is tremendously disappointing to be fed different versions. I should have read more thouroughly, I wished I hadn't bought it."
1,Don't buy this CD if you like these songs!,"If you want to hear these songs the way you remember them buy a collection featuring the original artists. These versions range from passable to awful. I love these songs, I hate these performances."
3,Yardstick YS24,"Like the trimmer, but for heaven's sake don't try to find a replacement charger for it. They are not to be found and you can not contact American Gardner as their 24/7 so call phone number isn't listed and no address to write to them. Don't depend upon customer support either. Been waiting months for a reply. I'll buy a Black and Decker. More reliable to obtain replacement parts."
4,Cordless Heavyer Line Trimmer,"I'm totally sold on buying the American Gardner Yardstick from Amazon.com. I personally think it works Awesome for me. Especially with theheavyer line, .080. If I were to look back, the only thing I would change, would be to have the batteries on the outside, similar to the B&D.; Or to offer a rapid charger. Since the chargesometimes seems to end before you get done. However, I still wouldn't trade it, since I enjoy the heavyer line."
1,Dont buy it,Dont buy it. In the first place when the battery goes bad in about a year you cant get replacements from the company. In the second place before the battery goes out the thing begins to fall about starting with the shroud that is supposed to cut the line. And speaking of the line you have the fun of finding the the line has gone inside the spool constantly so that you are always taking the spool apart to restring the cutting line. Other than these things its great.
1,"Unit is heavy, quit working after 3 months","I probably only used this trimmer for 4 hours. I found the weight a large factor. It's heavy. After holding it for 20 minutes, your arms will be sore. I am male, 5' 10"", 200 lbs with strong arms and shoulders.I found the cutting path to be narrow until I took off the shroud that cuts the trim cord.Higher ratings if it still worked."
2,I'm switching to Black and Decker,"I bought this several months ago on the strength of the other reviews. The trimmer is attractive and balanced well, and the battery lasts long enough for me to work for almost an hour, which is great. Beyond that, I can't say much in favor of this item. The spool of line jams constantly--I've switched the spool and that doesn't help. Every five or ten seconds I have to manually pull off the spool and advance the line by hand. The bumping mechanism is really poorly designed. The line has also broken the plastic guard at the end, so I'll replace it before selling this used or giving it away. I'm going to look at double-string trimmers, and anything by Black and Decker since their other products have worked well for me. This one has been a pain...from the start,"
2,just a sucker consumer,"It's too heavy, unbalanced, doesn't keep a charge very long, the cord keeps breaking and it won't serves as an edger.....it trims fair and is cordless....so if that's what you're after BUY it....if not, stay with what you have."
5,Great trimmer,"I've had this trimmer for 1 month and have decided I wish I had one of these years ago. It is so easy to use and I've never run the battery down, even trimming the half acre of lawn the condo complex we own sits on.I've had corded trimmers and gas trimmers over the years and I think this one is the best of both worlds. It has all the power of a gas model and the convenience of an electric model.If you're thinking of buying a string trimmer do yourself a favor get this one, you won't be disappointed"
1,Worst of any pop-feed trimmer that I have used,"I just finished replacing a brand new line unit and before I could even finish my front lawn I had to fix the line at least 10 times! And this is not the first time that I have had this issue, it is every time. I wish I had never purchased this item and I will never buy another."
5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this trimmer,"I was delighted to find that this trimmer is more than strong enough to run without getting sluggish in the thicker parts of my lawn edge. It's well balanced, the line feeds easily and hassle free, feather light, adjusts easily for my height, and has lots of charge left when I've finished our 4000 sq ft lawn.My new favorite tool for making life easy !!!"
2,Not an auspicious beginning,"The trimmer seems to have potential - power, well balanced, decent battery life. But I too ended my first session with the string cutter sheared off.When I contacted American Gardener, they punted on providing service, referring me back to the purchaser. They (Tool Crib of the North) don't provide customer service over the weekend.So the jury's still out."
5,"Sears sells same model for more, wish I had bought at Amazon","I've had this trimmer for a year now, it works great--especially if you use lighter gauge line (it came with 0.080"", when that was used up, I rewound it with 0.065""). Yes its light duty, and somewhat heavy, but the ""twist-to-edger"" function is way cool, as is the freedom from gas engine/noise or electric cord management issues you have with other weed trimmers. I average about 40 minute run time after a full charge. Wow, under $60 delivered to your door? Dude, what are you waiting for?"
1,Support Stinks,"Customer Service is terrible, no help at all. They clearly do not stand behind their products. Needed parts and they were unable to help me."
1,Don't waste your money,"battery always charged to full power within 2-3 hours. However, spent 2 years chasing the line inside the spool because it would not feed line when prompted. Tonight, finally had enough and smashed against a tree! I am buying a Black & Decker Hedgehog!"
2,Bad Quality Product,I have used this unit about 5 times only.Already the spool advance cap has broken off.If your buying.I would look for a better quality product.They lost my buisness.
2,"Nice idea, questionable quality","Strengths-----------* Cordless* Well balanced* No gas, no oil, no exhaust fumes!Weaknesses------------* Charge doesn't hold up for larger yards* Blade that cuts off excess trimmer line broke after 2nd useBottom line: Nice idea, run time would be OK for smaller lots, but quality, especially on the the trimmer line blade, is lacking.If the blade wouldn't have broken, I might have rated it 3.5 stars, instead I will be giving it to UPS to return to Amazon."
5,WOW WHAT A TRIMMER,"I was skeptical about purchasing this product, but after using it, I can say..."" WOW what a trimmer"". The reviews from other users was also a big plus. Our yard is 15000 square feet, surrounded by a wire fence, trees, shrubs, sidewalks, all these require trimming, even though the instructions warned me not to trim too close to the wire, I wanted to try it anyhow, it worked great, but I would not make a habit of this. It is so easy to use and lightweight, just a flick of the trimmer and you have an edger, and it really makes a nice groove between the sidewalk and the grass. It is also easy to maneuver in tight or small places, one speed and not loud like some gas trimmers. So easy to start, no pull cord, I have bursitis in my shoulder and I no longer have to deal with the pain associated with pulling a cord. It takes about 16 hours to charge and its ready the next time I have to use it, I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Battery Sucks,The trimmer works fine until the battery dies. Try to find a replacement for less than the cost of the trimmer. Good Luck!!
3,"Work, but heavy","It weighs more than a bowling ball, but, It's easier to use than mixing gas and oil and repeated pulling just to get started. I miss the power of a gas edger."
1,Decent product but bad customer service,"My advice - do not buy this product unless you are willing to throw it away if a part breaks down.I have used my Yardstick trimmer for a number of years and have no complaints other than the batteries didn't last as long as I thought they should. My problem arose when I tried to order replacement batteries. I placed the order over two months ago; my credit card was charge soon thereafter for the purchase amount. I placed a follow-up call before paying my credit card bill. I was told the batteries were back-ordered, but I would get them within a week after May 5. I paid the credit charge. After an additional five (5) follow-up calls, I still have not recieved the batteries. So, buyer beware!"
1,YardStick bad buy,Do not recommend purchase of the YardStick 24-volt because:1. It is too heavy - much too heavy for my wife.2. Normally after using about 5 minutes the line breaks and retreats into the coil housing requiring disassembly - it takes about 15 minutes to fix.3. Battery lasted only one year - very expensive to replace so I didn'tBig disappointment
2,Broke first time I used it,"Battery operated trimmer is a good idea but not this one. The firsttime I used it the string cutter broke off. It had marginaly adequate power for trimming but I don't think it would handle anything too tough. My advice is leave this one alone. Wait until they reengineer the cuttter, because I promise you it will break."
3,Works Ok,Works good for small light duity jobs but will not cut down large weeds. If you have a small yard and do not want to mess with gas or an electrical extension cord this unit will work OK.
4,Line cutter needs improved,"I purchased two of these due to the size of my yard. Overall I am pleased with their performance. However, as I had read in another review I experienced problems with the line cutter. It broke off after the third use. I am fairly handy so I drilled out the rivets on the old line cutter and made a stronger one and riveted it back on. So far, so good. The company needs to re-engineer this small component! Otherwise, these trimmers are doing a good job.Clarence BellBryan, OH"
2,Poor performer,"If you are looking for a replacement for a gas trimmer, this is not the one. I decided I did not want to drag a cord around anymore but I did not want to worry about a gas engine. So I thought the battery was the answer. WRONG. This one is too heavy. The gas motor is heavy but is well balanced. This trimmer is not balanced, you carry all the weight. Second the cover around the head is too small. Third the trimmer advertises you may turn it around and use it as an edger. Well you can turn it around but forget edging with it. Every time I attempted this the line broke off inside the head. I had to stop, take off the line spool, fish out the line and start over. This occurred every time I tried it as an edger. Last it is underpowered. I used it for about 30 minutes. It did keep running but would bog down when attempting to cut a moderately thick patch of grass."
1,"Company bankrupt, no parts available!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Bought this product last year. Have had problems from the beginning. The trimmer didn't hold a charge for more than 10-15 minutes. The connector between machine and charger is not very user friendly. Went to charge it this spring and the charger is cracked. Checked website and found they are defunct. No way to charge machine. Now it's just a large paperweight.
5,A Nice Alternative Trimmer,"I received this trimmer about 1 month ago and I am impressed. Although it is a tad bit heavier than I would like, it certainly works quite awhile before running out of juice, like some of it's competitors. Plus, it gets though heavier stuff than I would have imagined. The string feed works great! The wall bracket/charger is nice.I have had a couple wired trimmers and gas trimmers over the years. I believe this is my favorite. I do wish it had a strap, but thats not a major issue.It is so nice to trim without smelling like 2-cycle oil or having to drag out drop cords. Great value here."
3,A Lot of Hype,"A so-so trimmer. Line cutter will surely break. Replacement cost is ridiculous. Was a previous owner of Yardstick model LT10. Needed a replacement battery at a cost of $20.00. Not too bad except replacement battery was a ""dud"". Customer service offered me a 30% loyal customer discount on a YS24 at a cost of $71.00. Found out I could purchase a new one at local hardware for $69.00 without the so-called 30% loyal customer discount!!!. Having previous experience with the YS24 (my daughters)and as stated above the problem with the line cutter, I think I will pass on this one. The 30% discount amounts to ""zip"". Thanks but no thanks!!!!!!!"
1,Good for about half an hour's worth of perusing. Then...?,"As a baseball fan and photography buff, I liked the photos in this book. But once you look through it, you'll just sit it on the shelf and be done with it. And that's not something I'm happy with considering the cost of this book."
2,Dissappointing,"Poor sound quality, too much of Jack for me - not my cup of Tea(garden). A couple of fair cuts, but nothing great. I was hoping to find a good collection of Satch material between his pioneering ""West End Blues"" era and the later ""Wonderful World"" years. I am still looking."
1,twink,"I purchased a copy of this from a cut out bin in 1981. The poppy and trite music and lyrics have sadly remained with me. I find their work to be predictable and devoid of any content - they were, in spite of Howe's presence, not particularly accomplished musicians. Their lyrics were superficial and meaningless. We coined a phrase for this sort of soft and vacuous music: ""twink."" I regard it as a step below the cherry people. if you are serious about your music, listen to serious music - there is a great deal of excellent psychedelic music out there - don't start here."
4,Nice surprise!,"I got this for my birthday a few weeks ago, and wow, what a great record! It's always cool to find something this good that you haven't heard before. Not just ""My White Bicycle"" which is still one of the classic psych pop tunes of all time, but the whole record. And I was amazed that anyone could do such a fantastic and more than credible version of Strawberry Fields Forever."
4,excellent peek into Swinging London,"I think the only reason I gave this only a 4-star rating is because a few of the songs haven't aged well. Things like the 'good wizard meets the naughty wizard' feel like a Monty Python skit. Really dumb.But 90% of the fare here is excellent pysch pop, and the musicianship and performances are top shelf. Listen to Steve Howe playing guitar on the Byrds cover 'Why' and you will be amazed. Please don't let my minor negativity talk you out of purchasing this important record. Tomorrow deserve to be remembered and emulated. They were damn cool.Tune in, Turn on and DROP"
4,Wow,"Yes, the acting and effects and blah blah blah weren't perfect, but I found the movie to be very good despite that. I wasn't even expecting anything that special when I rented it. However, the movie had a really eerie feel about it that totally creeped me out. The flaws didn't matter. The sensation was still there. A twisted and frightening low-budget flick based on legend, The 13th Child should at the very least be given a chance."
1,WAS THAT FOR REAL??!,"i have sat through many bad movies in my life but this one took the cake. i cannot say one good thing about this movie. the plot was terrible and the acting was even worse. where did they get these ""actors""? there wasn't even a hint of emotion in their faces even when they come across a severed torso. the actual devil was an anticlimactic joke. this is one of those movies that will dumbfound you as to why it was ever released. there was one amazing thing about it: that i actually finished it. if you are looking for terror and gore look elsewhere. this movie was an insult."
1,Misinforming,"Being of South Jersey all of my 28 years reading all about the Jersey Devil and being of N.J. Native American Indian heritage, I have NEVER heard of the Jersey Devil ever being rumored as a Leni Lenape. Where did they get their information? Even though this is not a documentary, they should've changed the name of the subject (Jersey Devil) to something else. Also, since it wasn't a documentary, they definately should not have had an author of a book on the Jersey Devil tell his testimony. It confused the rest of the country as to what the Jersey Devil is and also made a false statement about the Leni Lenape Tribe. I just hope that everyone that saw the movie will further research it and discover the truth behind the lengend. I am very disappointed in this film. Not only was every aspect of it WRONG, the acting & ""monster"" stunk! I hope that Volume I did so bad that they won't be able to do a Volume II."
4,Pretty good Movie!,"... Even though this movie had a small budget, you can see that the director put a lot of effort into making this film worthwhile. The plot is very interesting and the acting was pretty good. The atmoshpher and the techniques used to add suspense with the Devil were very good. Over all, the movie made a lot of sence. I was never lost at point in the film. Go see it."
1,The Jersey Devil is not an indian spider named Bruno.,"Uh.. yeah.We saw this in the very limited run in the theater. Worst movie ever. There was one lovely scene where they were flying over the pine barrens and the trees were all yellow and music was playing - I enjoyed it so much because there were no characters, plot, or dialogue - which made it the best part of the movie.Another highlight was when my brother accidently poked me in the eye, so that I couldn't see right for about ten minutes. I thanked him for weeks after."
3,Low Budget but very watchable movie,"This movie is a detective story with a horror twist. The writers use the Jersey Devil as the antagonist for the film and they do play around with the legend some. For a low budget film there are some very good production values. Many low budget direct to video films either rely heavily on CGI or look like a director's home movie. This movie has several seasoned actors and some new ones. The acting from the veterans is believable and the new actors do a good job.I don't understand all the bad reviews for this movie. Yeah, it has some clichés and they do change some things for the sake of drama, but this movie is very watchable. It's obviously a low budget film, but the production crew did a lot with the little they had. I also don't understand why so many reviewers found the movie confusing. It seemed pretty straightforward to me.This movie is not the best movie ever made, but it's certainly not the worse, either. I found it interesting and fun to watch."
1,The rental box was damaged...,"...I wanted to burn the thing myself.My wife and I like laughing at schlock, but this one defines ""going past good and back to bad,"" it defines HACK. There's having fun with your amateur skills, and then there's telling yourself, and the audience, that money is the only thing keeping your work from being important.Stay away. No matter how masochistic you think you are. You'd have a similar yet better time watching a leper pleasure themselves with a mirror."
2,CREATURE OF THE PINELANDS,"One of the finest horror films to be made about New Jersey since the Toxic Avenger. How about the Toxic Avenger vs.the NJ devil?This movie has a 1950's flavor to it (minus the trailer sex scene.) The ""who done it"" aspect which the box mentions never materializes as all evidence, clues, and circumstance lead to Mr. D. (devil). Scooby-doo is a better mystery. Since the ""who done it"" aspect stank, they should have shown more of the monster killing people in unique ways. Of course that might of added an extra day's shooting. I am not sure why they showed the date as being Halloween when it really didn't enter the story.The picture on the back of the box of the monster (spoiler alert) carrying a scantily clad woman never appears in the movie.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, near sex, nudity."
2,"I watched it, what else can I say.","Was it awful, yes. Was it confusing, yes. Was the acting bad, not really, the girl inspector was good, Robert Guilium was good, the Rangers were good enough. The story pretty much sucked though. The creature would have been better if never seen. I would have given the movie 3-stars if the creature where only seen in shadows. I think the problem was that the story might have been decent (in a book or comic), but was not designed to translate very well into a movie."
2,Interesting premise just badly acted and badly shot,"This movie is just one of those B-movie wonders that spring out by the dozen over the course of the year. They aren't made to really affect you in any way, but moreover are created to hopefully illuminate the careers of either some budding young actors, or rekindle those of some Hollywood has-beens! Well, 'The 13th Child' doesn't do either for either genre it's sad to say as this flick is about as scary as watching the lastest cartoon 'Scooby-Doo Mystery' and about as absorbing as watching paint dry! That said, the only bright spot of the flick is the over-acting by ex-'Soap' star Robert Guillaume! And if you blink you'll miss the beautiful Lesley-Anne Down in her 3 minute role!"
3,Something is inherently wrong here...,"There is something very disturbing about a book where the heroine's boss suggests helping her with her problem -- VIRGINITY at TWENTY-THREE!! First of all, why did she tell him? Secondly, why did he suggest that he be the one to help her? It makes him look rather sleazy. Thirdly, why is this ruining her life? Is she that terribly insecure that she MUST dispose of her horrible virginity to be truly happy and at peace with herself? Oh, and happy she is, once she loses it. Umm...seems a bit of a quick fix. I think there are deeper psychological issues here. Somewhere I missed the falling in love part in the book, too. Where was it? Did it actually happen? But then again, this IS a Harlequin romance. It is silly to expect great literature."
5,Just like new!,"The product was just like the new one I purchased a couple of years ago, only half the price. Great value!"
2,Definitely not what I was looking for,"Like some of you, I searched out the soundtrack thinking it would contain the music used in the movie. The CD only contains the background filler instrumentals, which aren't bad but not what I was looking for. To save you the grief, I found the tracks that you may be looking for:Keep Hope Alive - The Crystal Method (Vegas)Makes Me Wanna Die - Tricky (Pre-Millennium Tension)To The Listeners - Eric B & Rakim (Follow the Leader)Escape from the City of Angels - Ithaka(?)"
1,"Can you say ""Bait and Switch"", sure you can.","Boy, do I wish I'd checked out this site before buying this CD! It says on the shrink-wrap, ""soundtrack"". It is NOT! It is a ""score"", background music you didn't notice between the Crystal Method, Tricky and Ithaka tracks. They're not HERE!! You didn't notice THIS music during the movie and you certainly don't want to pay $17 for it. I've never taken a CD back before, but this sucker's history. This is FRAUD! If I wanted to listen to John Tesh... NONE of the great Techno tracks from the movie here. VERY disappointed and deceived. If anybody wants to start a class action law-suit against Columbia for deception, I'm in!! Excellent movie, loved it, but they dropped the ball here."
2,"WARNING - This is the SCORE, not the SOUNDTRACK","Like most of the people who reviewed this cd, I bought it thinking that it was the SOUNDTRACK (songs like Crystal Method's Keep Hope Alive and Trick's She Makes Me Wanna Die), but I was sorely mistaken. So, just as fair warning, If you want a SOUNDTRACK, it doesn't exist. Go get the singles. This is the music from the fight scenes and such. I give it two stars because it's ONLY good for background music. I find it impossible to put it in a cd player and listen to it over headphones. You absolutely cannot get into it, which is the case for most scores anyway."
1,not exactly what youll expect,"i bought this cd thinking it would have all the cool music it's movie had, but it is all just the background music to the fight scenes and stuff.i was dissapointed"
2,Bland,"If you're looking for the instrumental at the beginning of the movie, you won't find it here. Instead, review ""Keep Hope Alive"" from The Crystal Method (album title is ""Vegas""). This song rocks!"
1,"Can you say, ""Rip Off""?","I, too, was in search of the great techno tracks from the movie. I am disappointed by the almost deceptive use of the word ""soundtrack"". The studio should release a second recording that includes the great songs from the movie, not just background filler!"
1,"Could have been good, but a great disappointment","I'm extremely annoyed with the producers of this ""soundtrack"". This is a score! Not that it's a bad score, so if that's what you're looking for, it's great, but there were three sublime songs in the movie that weren't on the disc, and I'm still eager to find them. One is ""She Makes me Wanna Die"", another is ""City of Angels"", and the third is the intro song by Crystal Method. If anyone can help me out, let me know. Otherwise, mail dead fish to the record studio."
1,None of the music I expected to be on this CD was present.,The Techno sound tracks I was looking for from the movie are not present on this CD... I found this out after paying 16 dollars for it.
1,I Found The Ithaka Track!,"For those of you looking for the Ithaka track from the movie, try kazaa. Just search under ""escape from"". I got all of the good tracks from the movie this way and this one was by far the hardest to find. Happy searching!"
1,"Disappointed, to say the least.","I too purchased this CD expecting to enjoy some of the great music I experienced while watching the movie. Take my advice-don't bother. Sound track is what you want, musical score is what you get. Frankly, I didn't even notice the musical score while watching the movie. If I didn't know the difference then, I do now. Fool me once......"
4,"Serious, moody and exciting film score music",Not what a lot of people thought it would/should be. If you're interested in action film score music tis worth the dough.
3,OK Background Music,"Good, low-key, background or theme music. Though good enough in its own right, some parts are a bit bland.John's Theme (the recurring undertone theme) is very good on its own.Very similar to The Rock soundtrack. I'd recommend The Rock before this, however."
3,"Only contains the original, instrumental score","I looked for this CD forever and when I finally found it, I bought it without really looking at it first. The music in the movie was so killer (no pun intended) especially ""She Makes Me Want to Die"" but none of that stuff is on the CD. Still the original composition stuff is pretty good and I'm still glad I got it."
1,The absolute worst score of 1998!,"I'll make it short and simple: there is only one good track here, and that was the first one. Everything else was an electronic mish-mash of filler music. There was no cohesiveness whatsoever. What the heck were they thinking? They should have included the songs used, plus the opening techno music. That was just awesome. Oh well, so HGW bombed this score. He made better contributions on ""Antz"" and ""Armageddon"" (movie only). Stay away from this CD like the plague!"
2,NO ITHAKA ON THIS CD,"If you were hoping to score the ITHAKA track""Escape From the CITY OF ANGELES"" used in theganster cave sequence, it ain't here. Instead, see:mp3.com/ithakaor try the portuguese website: sapo.pt and order hisalbum, flowers and the color of paint.....that's about theonly place to get it but you might need a friend who readsportuguese to order."
5,Another hit by Harry Gregson-Williams,"This is another great score from Harry Gregson-Williams. Many may remember that he did the score for Disney's The Chronicle's of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Here, his music is just as stunning.Yes, this is the score but the majority (if not all) of the 1 star reviews are from people who didn't bother to research or even look at the back of the cd. This cd should not suffer bad reviews for the customer's mistake. Check out the available blurbs on Amazon and judge for yourself."
4,Decent but not what i expected.,For those of you looking for the ithaka song called Escape from the city of angels I found it at ftp://mp3:mp3@195.17.113.110:21 but good luck geting it. Its an MP3
4,This was a great soundtrack,"The Replacement Killers soundtrack was a cool soundtrack. If you like music with alot of drums, you should buy this CD. I gave this one a four because the music was very cool, plus if you are a Mira Sorvino fan, that makes it even better.Plus I recomend seeing the movie, which was very cool!"
1,Only for those with sharp eyes,"Like everyone else who reviewed this, i was dispointed with the lack of anything other than ochestral. i bought from a store and failed to notice 'original music score', so keep your eyes open.Unless you like faux classical pass this one over and read all the names on the movie"
1,"Disappointing... ""Soundtrack""?","After seeing the movie, which contained several excellent techno tracks, I spent a good deal of time trying to track down this CD. I was pretty excited when I finally found it...however, this CD doesn't have any of the techno songs from the movie. The CD is actually what is traditionally known as a movie score -- that is, a collection of instrumental pieces that were written specifically to enhance the effect of certain scenes in the movie. Not that the score was unbearably bad, (although I didn't care for it much -- it was sort of ""New Age"" classical -- not my type of music) but it just wasn't what I had expected. So my search for the song ""She Makes Me Want to Die"" (the best techno track from the movie) continues..."
2,Disappointed,Get this if you want the musical score and not the music soundtrack. I ended up giving this to my son.
1,Question,So does the CD contain music with lyrics? or an actual score? cause if its one with lyrics and not the actual score it will save me the trouble getting it and spending money on something i wont be happy with....
2,Ithika,"Good Luck To All of You in Search for Ithika's ""Escape from the City of Angels"" I have been looking for a year, You might as well give up, I am begining to believe it was never released in the U.S. EXSCAPE p.s. if you actually find it email me."
1,Get in line for the disappointment........,The tunes in the movie were excellent. Maybe the bozo's who put together the score will realize that and put out the 'real' hits to this fine movie...
1,where is all the cool done over voices?,"ok, so i never really bought the album, but while watching the movie i heard some music that sounds a lot like the music from the panasonic comercial for the writeable cd's. i'm trying to find that music because i like the use of voices and techno keyboards. any help just email me."
3,A great book to begin your journey with Homer,"This book is especially useful for someone who has finished a basic course in Greek and now wants to tackle Homer (as opposed, for example, to The Anabasis). While written for the novice, I would hesitate to recommend it to the beginner wanting to learn Greek. There are other courses better designed for self-study."
5,"Menin aiede, thea","After New Testament Greek, Homeric Greek is arguably the easiest dialect of Greek to learn, although the Classical tends to be standard. As the world of classical languages seems to lose ground in the schools, the introduction to Greek via Homer would prove an interesting exploration. This chestnut on the subject is well-done, concise and well-organized,leading briskly into the strangely distant yet near world of both the Iliad itself and the mysterious age of the Archaic Greeks whose sudden precipitous surging advance in the eighth century gave birth in a rapid clip to our most fundamental traditions. The Iliad, by a strange mystery, came first before everything and yet has always remained the greatest of the epics. Surprising to find this old standby at Amazon. If you feel like learning a mysterious language and poetry, this book would make a fine hobby. I.F. Stone (Cf. Socrates on Trial) learned Greek at seventy. Your move."
1,Very bad,"This book is the worst excuse for a text book I have ever come across. The explanations of Greek grammar and spelling are mostly incomprehensible. I would recomend that a beginner start with any other book he or she can find on the Epic dialect. The reference section in the back, however, is a good as the grammar section is bad. It is the best quick-find reference I have seen. I use it constantly."
5,Straight to the top,"This is an excellent way to learn classical Greek. It takes you straight to unsimplified Homer within a few lessons and if you tough it out you can end up able to read Homeric Greek quite well. It works fine as a teach-yourself book. I had had a semester of Greek many years ago, but I was essentially starting from scratch.Each lesson provides the vocabulary for a few lines of Book I of the Iliad and sends you to the reference grammar at the back of the book to learn the grammar incrementally. Early on there are some prose sentences in Homeric Greek to translate, but these go away in later lessons. Once you have finished the book you will have read all of Book I and will be ready to continue through all of Homer (with a lexicon). My only gripe is that a few more prose sentences to illustrate the grammar points by repetition would have helped a bit. Overall a great teach yourself book."
4,Karl Jenkins Soft Machine w/ John Etheridge,"I had this on Vinyl back in 1978 too. This 2 disc set includes materrial from the concert over a three day period in 1977. It was released in 1978. Thus, the original title.Even at the time, John Etheridge's guitar playing was impressive. It still is.The Nodder and the 2.30 minutes guitar piece are the gems on the original album. The second disc here is fantastic! It features a lot of tunes live I had not heard live before. It is simply great! Hot playing and decent song writing from the band, trying for a ""come back"" release.It is not perfect but well worth while. Great spins!"
2,Getting A Little Chilly,"Well played,well recorded, yet unimaginative. This music is more like a new agey Windham Hill type band only with more furious Al Dimeola style electric guitar. This was basically an ""in name only"" Soft Machine, with just about all it's core members gone save for Karl Jenkins(and he's not an original Soft either) who has forsaken any horn playing and stuck to keyboards here. Guitarist John Etheridge is a shredder without the personality and voice of an Alan Holdsworth."
2,Not Very Helpful,"If you have any common sense, you don't need this book. You can definitely learn what Bunton writes about elsewhere. It didn't offer any practical advice. It was poorly written. It didn't offer good examples and provided poor instructions."
5,A dance classic from the golden era of movie musicals.,"Gene Kelly's Invitation to the Dance is a rare and wonderful movie musical; it was under-appreciated when it was first released, but is wonderful to enjoy today and I'm glad it's available. The three segments, the broken- hearted clown dance, the Sinbad the Sailor (with cartoons and live action combined) ballet and the dance about a ring that gets around, are delightful to watch. An interesting note: Dancer Carol Haney did the live-action dancing later redone by an animated girl in the Sinbad number. I wish someone were making musicals these days!"
3,Beautiful artwork but lacking story,"The story of Good Night, Fairies, such as it is, is a fanciful list of all of the things that Fairies do. Without a story-line to tie those acts together this book reads more like a catalog of Fairy capabilities than a story. As such it can make a good bed-time book for younger children who want to think some happy thoughts before they go to sleep.For my daughter the situations are too simple to hold her interest, so this book only rarely comes off the shelf while more story centric books like ""Frog and Toad are Friends"", ""The Tales of Tiptoes Lightly"", and ""Woody, Hazel, and Little Pip"" are all worn on the edges."
3,"Sister Street Fighter is great...the other movie, well...","Interestingly enough, I got this release more for the Sonny Chiba film. While I couldn't stomach the maudlin and overblown Whitney Houston remake, I was genuinely curious, after enjoying some other Chiba films (Bullet Train in particular is a highly recommended entry) to see how this one went. And while it is a huge improvement over the lousy Hollywood pastiche that followed, it's rather more dull than I would have hoped or expected as a longtime fan of Japanese action cinema (both chambara/samurai and 'modern day' 70's crime flicks).On the other hand, Sister Street Fighter was great, and a real gem of its type - highly recommended for fans of the recent Pinky Violence set and films like Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs. Good stuff."
3,Sneakers,"They were too big by half a size so we sent them back, probably not a good idea to order shoes online."
4,comfortable fit,"This is a solid shoe which was well packaged and delivered on time. I was very happy with the quality and timeliness of shipment as well as with the quality of the shoe upon receipt. I have been wearing it now for a couple of weeks and it has a very nice, comfortable fit and the sole is well insulated for comfortable walking. In fact, I am going to order another pair in black."
4,Nice Shoes,"I purchased these for my 15 year old for Christmas, he is very rough on shoes but so far the shoes are standing up well. The black is a bit more 2 toned than the picture seems to show so the leather on the shoe is more of a dark brown than a black."
5,Great Shoes,I bought these for my boyfriend because he had told me before how much he loved these shoes! I bought them for him a surprise and he wears them everyday! He loves the comfort and the durability!
1,Beware: Piece of crap,"I usually like Adidas shoes and I have a good collection. this one is an extreme opposite of what an Adidas should be like.First thing: It runs small, a whole number or one and half smaller.made of very poor materials and didn't loosen even after being used 4 times now.Also, this is the first time I had this problem with shoes: even they're both 8.5 the left side one is bit tighter than the right one. that made me end with bruises from first use.If i could give 0 star, I would put it."
4,Great sneaker for cycling!,"I have to say these arent the most comfortable to walk in and they are kind of flat but these do make awsome cycling shoes if you are an avid cycler and dont like straping on a pair of cleats and prefere riding with traditional flat pedals these sneakers are great. Nice, lite and flat."
5,Classics Only!,"This is the truest form of the Samba. There are the Adidas Originals sambas, and a few other varieties, but their quality and comfort all pale in comparison to the classic. Notable differences are the strength of the heals (Metal on the Classic, cardboard/plastic on the Originals), the rubber compound in the sole (the originals version is a harder, less grippy, more plastic compound, and finally the quality of the leather and stitching. I had a pair of the originals in green and the leather had completely separated from the sole in less than a year. On the contrary, my first pair of Sambas, which are classics, have lasted nearly four years under harsh conditions such as white water rafting trips and to this day I wear them at my job as a cook."
4,Cool sneaks,"I wasn't looking for much, just some comfortable, affordable black sneakers. My only complaint is I wish they were a little wider for my paddle feet. The leather also ""squeaks""."
4,Crossfitters- give it a try.,"I'm very happy with the shoes, although I find they run a little small, so I had to return the first pair. I'm using them for crossfit, particularly when doing lifts. I don't particularly like running in them, however, as they aren't the squishy running shoes I'm used to."
1,Sizing is misleading - beware!,"I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes. The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male. Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund. I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a ""buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly"" promotion and Amazon prime, so my ""refund"" would be less than nothing.That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money. Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead. Yeah, that seems fair."
1,Amazon error,"Amazon represented these as women's shoes but when I received them they were men's. It turns out that the company no longer makes these shoes for women but that is how they are clearly listed on Amazon.Even though this was Amazon's fault, and I sent plenty of support documention, I had to pay $9 to return these shoes and was not reimbursed or even acknowledged.I will not order through Amazon again!"
1,Christmas gift,"The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase."
3,"Returned, what is the status",I returned the shoes for the correct size. Please advise the status of replacing them.Thanks
1,awesome,"These are true classics. I remember not liking them when they first came out decades ago, but I can't remember why. Anyway, the shoes are really comfortable and fit true to size. This is a VERY subjective thing to comment about - fit. If the proverbial shoe fits, wear it. And for me these fit. Cheers."
2,Not very comfortable!,"I am not a soccer player, but I liked the style of this shoe. When I recieved them I thought the tongue was ridiculously too big and just looked silly. The arch support in my pair was like having large ant mounds in the soles of my shoes. After wearing them for work for 8 weeks, the ant mounds finally broke in a little bit, but now the heal feels wore out. I would not recommend these except for maybe wearing them for short stints with a pair of jeans to cover the silly looking tongues."
2,really pretty bad,"really pretty bad. hurt my feet. get terrible grip on anything but concrete. held up for a long time on the outside,but not on the onside. only other good thing to say os that they look kinda cool."
4,Nice every day shoes,"This is a great pair of shoes, for the every day and more but not quite a good shoe for sports, it s a little tigh should have the W size but still it s a great choice, nice materials and arrive in the expected time"
2,Decent Shoe - Always breaks,"I have owned two pairs of these shoes and lost both of them after the glue connecting the rubber and cloth parts came undone, and I lost the heels. Otherwise they are comfortable, although the arch is somewhat lacking!"
5,Casual shoe for 12 - 21,"I've gotten a pair of these about ever year and a half since I was 11. I have wide feet and I can never find sneakers that are comfortable enough. True, they don't have a whole lot of arch support, but that's easy enough to solve with an insert if you absolutely need it."
3,shoe review,"for looks only, this is a good buy but it is narrow in the toe box so don't get unless your willing to deal with pinched feet or you have a naturally narrow foot. I also think the extra long tongue is strange but my son, who wears these, thinks it's cool."
4,Comment,The shoes is really comfortable and I had a good time wearing this!!!! Love it! It is suitable and affordable if you want a good shoes to play indoor soccer
2,Try a different vendor,"I don't know if I just got a bad pair but within 4 months of purchase, these shoes got a huge hole in the inside upper heal portion. And the shoe also completely lost its shape. I've had these shoes before for four years and they were very durable. Perhaps a different vendor?"
3,Black adidas sambas,I actually purchased this shoe as a gift. She wears an 8.5 in women so I thought this size would fit fine. The issue with this shoe is that it didn't fit true to size. It was small to be a 6.5 Men size. The inseam at the top of the foot is narrow and she said it cinched the back of her foot even with thin socks on (this was after she walked around in them for about 10 minutes). I haven't had any problems with adidas so I tried them on and she wasn't lying. As far as appearance you're definitely getting your classic Samaba!(this shoe has the long tongue also and I did'nt notice that when I purchased them).
5,I love Samba Classic,"I've play indoor football soccer for many years, and I tried other shoes and is not the same. I love samba classics"
1,"Poor Fit, Poor Quality!","Don't do it. These are not what I thought they would be. They are cheaply made, definitely not the old Adidas that turned out such great shoes years ago."
5,Dependable - Durable - Comfortable - Long Lasting,"I have been wearing the classic samba shoe for over twenty years. Why? Very simply - they are extremely comfortable; long lasting; durable, and dependable. I wear sweats and shorts a lot and I'm always ready to kick a soccer ball around at the drop of a hat. I've played both indoor and outdoor soccer for years and I have always been happy with my sambas. If adidas keeps making sambas I will probably keep wearing them until I'm 100 years old - and God willing - still able to kick a soccer ball around with my great great grand kids!"
1,Now available in piece of crap style...,"I have owned a pair of samba classics since high school. Loved them; until this pair. It turns out that when they changed the tongue label to blue it became printed on crappy foam. And it squeaks... All of the time... After three days of expecting this to stop, it hasn't. I am returning them (and now I have to find a new shoe...), bummer!!!"
1,not a soccer shoe,"This is not for playing soccer. Don't get fooled by the word ""classic soccer shoes"" that they use on the web. The shape of this shoes is just like a normal sneakers and not suited for kicking the ball. Just don't buy this shoes."
5,rad shoes,"these shoes are the bomb. i can run 2.3 times faster, and play ball 2.4 times better. check these things out if you got the cash."
1,No Arch Support,"I can't believe the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this shoe. This shoe has no arch support. I've played two pickup games that aren't too serious and I could barely walk after each one. They absorb no impact when you run and even though I tied them as tight as I could, blisters will still forming.The one positive thing I'll say about them is they get much more traction then my regular sneakers on an indoor basketball floor so I can change direction better, which is part of the reason I get blisters because I cut/change direction very fast. (I get them with regular shoes, but I was hoping these would stop that)I suppose if you're playing on grass or fake grass they might be ok but any hard surface I would avoid these sneakers. Also the extra long shoe tongue is annoying and looks bad folded down. (on the white sneakers at least)I went back to my tennis shoes, I'm getting rid of these."
1,Not for soccer!! too soft,"I bought these shoes because I wanted something I can wear around town and also play soccer with the shoes. Believe me, you are going to wish you did not buy them if you kick a soccer ball with them. I dont know what and ""indoor soccer ball"" feels like but I tried these shoes on two balls that I have because at first I thought one of the balls that I had was too hevay and hard but it turns out it was the shoes, after kicking 30 yard shots my foot was hurting so I put on my cheap spaldings from walmart and they felt better, now I realize Im going to have to return them and buy some real soccer shoes that are hard so I can kick 30 40 yarders all day long without hurting my foot like I did with these shoes..my email is rickalex21@hotmail.com if you have any comments send me with a subject of ""amazon adidas mens sambas"" ."
4,Excellent Shoes <3,"Excellent quality product, I love the material they are made these shoes, I recommend them. They are Super Comfortable . . ."
4,Fantastic Classic,"Excellent shoes. I keep these on rotation, the newer pair I use for indoor soccer, and the older pair for street wear. Extremely comfortable for people with wide/flat feet. My only complaint is that they stretch quite soon, and so do not last too long during regular soccer playing."
2,never buy it,seriously&#65292; these shoes make you clumsy the bottom of this shoe will make such a loud noise with the field&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;
5,Perfection,"Reading some of the reviews here and I became slightly apprehensive about purchasing these shoes - at least without going to the store and trying them on. The price wasn't ridiculous so I dove in and purchased these shoes. I ordered them on a Monday and got them on Wednesday - quick, easy service - exactly what I want. The only slight complaint I have, would be the inside box which contained the shoes looked slightly used, nothing too bad. I'm sure it could've been caused by the people handling the shipment. The shoes were in perfect brand-new condition, as were the laces. This is my first pair of Samba's and certainly won't be my last . They are slightly narrow so if you're in a half size, size up. I wear a 12.5 and am really glad I sized up to a 13."
2,"Look great, torture for your feet...","These shoes look great and have amazing style. Unfortunately, they are cheaply made and have zero comfort/support. I remember having an old pair of these that were amazing...something isn't quite right about these new ones. Its really too bad, they look cool but are torture to wear. Returned."
4,Good,Always loved these shoes. Pretty comfortable and worth the money. Would recommend them to someone in search of a comfortable shoe.
2,"Samba ""Original"" vs. ""Classic""-- KNOW THE DIFFERENCE","I have experienced both these pairs. Breakdown:CLASSIC:adidas Men's Samba Classic Soccer Shoe- Larger tongue- easier to slip on/off- medium/enhanced arch support. If you wear air-soled running shoes, you probably won't even notice. Personally, I'm NOT A FAN.- The arch support has changed in the last 3 years (the last time I bought this pair). Be warned!ORIGINALS:adidas Originals Men's Samba Reflective Sneaker- Smaller tongue- Old-school arch support (meaning flatter/next to none). I have worn nothing but Chucks and older Sambas happily for many years, and identify with the barefoot-running crowd, so for me, flatter is better.- Harder to slip on/off, but once it's on, it fits like a glove!- Yes, they squeak like everyone says. Doesn't bother me, but then again I'm not a movie usher, burglar or otherwise occupied in the skulking arts.Some people will prefer one over the other. For me, the clear winner is ORIGINALS."
3,"Good shoe, runs small","These are comfortable shoes, but order large if you don't have really narrow feet - I ordered a half size up, and they are still so small that I need to return them."
5,I love these shoes....,"OK, I have to admit to having a shoe problem, anyone will tell you this, afterall, I have almost forty pair. But these shoes are great. I bought these to replace a pair I have worn out, and that never happens with shoes cause I never keep them that long. So comfortable, I wear them all the time. The price was great, cause I never find them on sale. I am looking forward to ordering the white with black stripes as well. And I will most likely be ordering another pair of these for the future. Buy yourself a pair, totally worth every penny."
2,Quality is really hit or miss.,"I purchased two pairs. One pair was fine, on the other pair the left insole wasn't fitted corrected so my foot felt twisted when I had the sneaker on. That pair got returned and on the replacement pair the right insole doesn't feel like it is fitted correctly. I can feel the arch part of the insole against my foot whereas I do not have this feeling with the first good pair or even on the other shoe of the replacement pair. Very disappointed."
5,Loves these shoes,"These shoes are great. Wish I could find them cheaper, but price is always around $65.00. The shoes have lasted me over 2 years with casual use. I don't use them to play indoor."
5,Everybody knows these shoes are awesome.,"I went with sure shot style on this one. I think I got these because of my obsession with the Beastie boys. These look good with all my clothes and maybe I got what all the kids are talking about, swagg. ha right...but not really."
5,Classic!,This shoe is a classic! My boyfriend has been wearing them for years and years! Once he wears them down-we just get a new pair!
3,They're just ok...,Nothing to write home about...these shoes are narrow and the material is a little cheap. But their decent and although not too comfy....maybe they just need some wearing in. But they're just ok...although definitely not worth full price!
3,Security a Problem...,"The product was the best. We have always been happy with the Samba product - long lasting and wears well. But the company did not remove the security device attached to the shoe. The device was a very large one that even area stores could not remove. After many attempts, using various items to try to remove it, brute force had to be applied and yes they really do put blue ink in them to deter theft. The sneakers did indeed get the ink on them and so did the surrounding area!!! So much for 'new' shoes!!"
5,Excellent product.,"Excellent product, solid and fast delivery. I'm definitely pleased. You don't necessarily have to wear these classic shoes for soccer at all, they go great with everything."
4,Compared to Nike...,"I've always prefered Adidas over Nike. Adidas holds up better. This is practically the only Adidas shoe i'll wear. I need flat shoes because i don't really have an arch, so normally i buy Converse. These are good for Soccer. I use to wear them back in the days. Other than soccer or sports, they're good for playing drums."
1,Choppy and sad,"Avoid MAROONED IN IRAQ! Although it delivers on the promise of music, it failed the promo in other significant ways.When it tries for humor, the level is beneath Three Stooges. When it tries for pathos, the story is flimsy and, ultimately, unbelievable, especially the very end. While a theme of displacement echoes profoundly, it is not handled well, and certainly far from the comedic glimpse into tribal life promised."
3,Typical Ghobadi,"Not as impressive like ""A Time for Drunken Horses"" or ""Turtles also can fly"", but still a great testimony of the life in Kurdistan."
2,Works intermittently,"When it works, it works great, but it seems to have a loose connection somewhere because it does go out sometimes and you have to jiggle it to get it to work. So either a design flaw, or I got one with a manufacturing error."
2,Word of Caution,"Nice little flashlight and well crafted but, why in the heck does it need its very own specially sized ""AAAA"" battery? At first, I thought it was a mis-print on battery size. Streamlight should be ashamed of them selves. A person could really find themselves out of luck if the battery runs-out and nobody ""in-town or other country"" has never even heard of 4A size, worthless batteries. At the end of the day folks, no power means, no work. The engineers of StreramLight would be truly ""reaching"" to justify thier choice of batteries when ""AA"" or even ""AAA"" would work so much better and more efficiently."
3,Good solid instrumentals but lacking good song,"I really enjoyed listening this CD, but it left out a song that was in the movie- ""I Want What I Want"" by Lauren Christie. Leaving that out was a no-no....otherwise pretty good, though."
3,looking for song that was played in end credits,"i would like any info on a song ""someday"" played in the end credits. i thought it listed artist as ""sweet emily"" but it went by on screen to fast to be sure. i bought cd but this track was not on it,i was curious why and would appreciate any info on sweet emily if any one is familiar. thanks"
4,"Mystical, relaxing, takes your mind away from reality.....","I haven't bought the CD yet (soon) but I watched the movie. I like movies that have a great soundtrack to go with the mood of the movie. I remeber ""Miami Vice"". It had an excellent sound to go with the style of the show. I miss that style of show....."
5,Just damn great!!!!!,"Look folks, if you liked this movie, like I did, then you should really, no really, you must buy this CD. For this CD all I can say is: no comment."
1,Need new mind also,"1 1/2Although once in a blue moon there is a bright spot in this uninformed musical malarkey, on the whole this is indie-degrade at its underground worst; where what little attempted, consciously eclectic style completely trumps slivers of substance which can only be tooth-picked out."
1,......,"I saw this band open for Hella a few days ago and i can easily say they are the crappiest band i've ever seen in my life! Don't get me wrong, I like experimeantal music, when its good! This is just mindless noisy garbage. I play in a band that some say may be a bid sililar. we write silly new wave punk songs with a touch of world music and we consisit of a bass (me) drums, keyboard and a guy who sings/talks/scrams/ plays the horn/ smashes watermellons. and i think were a whole lot better then this band. this craps is just obnoxious."
5,Michael Pare plays twins,This film should prove what a good actor this man is. He plays a tough Marine held captive and a high school football coach who comes looking for his missing brother. He does double duty in this film. AND he does all the stunts for both parts!
3,killer,"It begins with a violent ambush. Marine Captain Craig Brandt & his girlfriend are attacked in a brutal assault which climaxes with Craig witnessing the murder of his loved one, then being taken away in an apparent kidnapping. But that's just the beginning - according to insiders, Craig died in a bombing - that's the official story - but not the real one. Is it a coverup? Is a conspiracy involved? How far does it go? It's up to Craig's twin brother Chris to challenge everyone's account & embark on an action-packed expedition into an underworld of crime, murder & corruption to save the brother he believes is still alive. Lots of excellent action sequences in this smash-bang thriller"
2,Skil drill - barely passable,"I've had issues with the keyless chuck since the beginning, can't tighten it enough to grab an average drill bit well.Shortly after new, the front end started becoming loose. I opened it up and found there was really nothing other than plastic to hold the front bearing assembly, and as you use the drill and it heats up a little, the plastic warms and deforms, to where finally, the gears stop meshing completely, the ring gear strips, and the drill finds its way to the trash..."
1,A piece of junk,"When I was lured into buying this drill, the ad read Skil 6130-01 3/8-inch 120V Drill USA. False advertising. First of all, the drill is made in China. Even the trigger feels like a cheap imitation of a US made tool. I took the chuck off of it and threw it in the trash. I'll probably end up doing the same with the chuck."
2,The Least Worthwhile Family Album,"Don't get me wrong . . . I love Family. They are probably my single all-time favorite, & the group whose work I most admire. But this one was tepid. ""The Weavers Answer"" and ""Hung Up Down"" are the only songs that rate with their best work. Every other Family album was much, much better than this one."
5,Ten Ever-Lovin' Years With Pogo,"This is a must book for all Pogo fans. It contains everything from the take off on Kruschev to such wonderful poems as ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Bat"", ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Here is the Hunter."" I bought this book in 1961 and still howl when I read it today."
3,Somewhat Good,"I am happy with this item and would have given it four stars because the design is a great use of space, it looks nice and it's heavy enough to have no problem holding plenty of heavy boots and shoes. I only gave it three stars however, because the product was somewhat damaged and the holes did not line up perfectly. Thus, the one support is turned out slightly and the rack does not sit perfectly level. Neither are a major issue and I'm still happy with the rack, it's just got quality issues that the manufacturer should not have overlooked."
3,An okay shoe rack,"This 4 tier shoe rack arrived in decent shape.There were a few scratches on the wood, but not enoughto return. It realistically holds 2 pairs of mens shoesper rack. Three pairs would need to be either crammed inor be smallish ladies shoes. This itemreally helped us in our organizing of things and is a welcomeaddition. It looks very nice, and does not look tacky in our LR."
3,Ehhh,"These racks are worth the price but not a penny more. Chrome pieces that attach to the wood sides were not all secured properly and were unable to be tightened because of the method of attachment. As was already noted in other reviews, Large men's shoes will not fit 3 pairs across (size 11) but my wife's fit fine (woman's 6.5). Assembly was very easy and once built the racks are nice and sturdy. Overall they generally do what I need them to, just nothing to get excited about."
3,Classic,"""On the Rise"" reminds me of some classic rock we're used to here in the States. Terje is really sweet as well."
4,This is the best beginning saltwater book for the price!,"This book is one of the best books for the saltwaterenthusiast. It provides great information on the aquariumand filtration as well as water quality, nutrition anddisease.It has many great pictures and provides a great start onunderstanding the marine aquarium. As a pet shop owner thisis the one book I always recommend for the first time marinefish keeper."
4,Missionary Man Leads the Way,"Despite what the amazon review says, ""Missionary Man"" WAS a hit single, and a grammy award winner for the duo (Best Rock Performance by a duo/group-1987). It's probably the most memorable of the 10 songs here- and certainly had one of the band's most provocative videos ever. Lots of up-tempo songs and good vocals from Annie. Guitar work from Dave is spirited. Overall a good cd."
3,Average Eurythmics,"""Missionary Man"" gets the album off to a great start -- the slow buildup of harmonica to a thump thump bass-and-drum beat accompanied by the Annie's heart-stoppingly deep vocals: ""I was born an original sinner...."" ""Thorn In My Side"" is a decently cute folk song, and ""When Tomorrow Comes"" has the hope of a ""Right By Your Side"". Then it gets tedious. With the exception of the sweet ""A Little of You"" there's nothing else on this album that's particularly memorable. Eurythmics was going downhill, and it would only get worse with ""Savage."""
4,Solid score,"While not being one of Goldsmith's best, this is a solid offering. I find that many of Goldsmith's soundtracks (and other scores and Classical works) require several listenings before you really appreciate the nuances. This is such a score. I listened to it a lot at my job (where we could play our own music) and I found that with each playing, it grew on me. I found that several tracks especially stood out after a while. I ended up liking this score quite a bit. It has a little bit of an ""Air Force One"" feel and energy to it. Though, of course, it is its own score.If you are a Goldsmith fan, you will want this soundtrack. It will grow on you."
2,Something's missing here.,"Even with the 30 minutes of music on the CD, it is enough to tell that this score is definately not one of Goldsmith's better ones. It's fair at best. The only good cue is the last one from the finale of the movie."
2,Ordinary Work from an Extraordinary talent,"This score still merits five stars compared to soundtrack slop like TITANIC, but this is very minor Goldsmith. There are moments of excitement (the sinking plane is quite thrilling) and the album makes an enjoyable listen for the composer's fans, but it's nothing special."
4,"almost perfect, but the erlenmeyer flask braught it down.","well if it wasnt for the erlenmeyer flask this tape would be perfect, but i didnt find the episode that great. But darkness falls is great. Its about some type of bugs that are killing people in the forest. and of course mulder and scully along with a park ranger and some other guy go up to the forest to investigate and....well you probably know what the story developes into."
5,A literarary promise fulfilled,"I was privileged to know this young writer in New Orleans when she was just beginning her struggle to write her first novel in the early 80's. What a joy it was to see the fruits of her toil and how far she has progressed as a writer. Where Blue Begins is a literary promise fulfilled, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. I look forward to even greater works from Janice Deaner in the future."
3,Blue Is the Color of Self-Knowledge,"If you are in the mood for introspection--this is the book for you. Janice Deaner is a master of arousing your curiosity. In both ""Where Blue Begins"" and ""The Body Spoken"" the narrator tells you bits and pieces as the story unfolds. In each you have no idea where the story is headed.It is only by continuing your reading quest that your curiosity becomes sated. She makes you wonder why you read her books because you learn about your need for suspense, your desire to know the characters, as if some part of your very own Jungian shadow will be revealed. And just as you are curious to know the outcome of the mystery that the protagonist Maggie discovers, you will wonder how you will have been changed by the very reading of Janice's work. Looking forward to the next Deaner discovery."
2,Don't bother,"It takes long too try to look up the various menu items. I tried using it once and gave up. It's not the fault of the book, just the practical aspects of eating in a foreign restuarant with a full menu of items to figure out."
1,Don't waste your money,"I also agree that this book is useless in a restaurant. It maybe interesting if you wanted to learn about French food, but the poor organization makes it difficult to look up an item from a menu. I would actually rate it 0."
2,"Warning, does not work in clone systems!","Being a huge fan of the Mad Max movies, I bought this game in an instant as I've gone through a bit of a NES craze the past little while. As it turns out; this game does not work in clone systems. You can watch the intro video which is actually a pretty cool 8 bit retelling of the opening of Road Warrior, but then you're left with a screen in which no controls will respond.As for the actual game which I tested on my real NES: it's okay. The driving sections are pretty fun but you're constantly on the verge of running out of gas (like in the movies) which forces you to enter caves. These sections are a much less fun top down shooter and unfortunately there's no avoiding them."
5,hauntingly beautiful,"one of the most beautiful collections of music i have ever heard. if you like a capella music or gregorian chants, you will love this. it is more complex and spirited than a gregorian chant, but it has a similar open quality.i had a pirated copy, but gave it back out of guilt. if anyone knows where i can buy a copy please let me know.i am a big fan of Hun Huur Tu. check out the albums that are available. if you have never heard tuvan throat singing you are in for a real treat."
1,Kindle Edition Review,I found this book to be poorly formatted for reading on the Kindle and do not recommend it to other Kindle owners.
3,Rhodonite Triple Drop Earings - Nice,"These are not the highest quality pair of earings out there, but they are great for the price. My wife actually wears these and that is a sign she doesn't think they look or feel cheap. Many people have complimented her on them and she loves it. They really do make a nice gift."
3,"Cover was not in the best of shape, but book is still good.","Cover flap was definitely ""old"" looking, with price sticker, ripped cover in the back and just plain old looking. However, the hardbook itself was in great shape."
3,Gets the job done,"Great size, very compact. Only issue is you can't keep the frame when shooting a portrait (turning the camera to shoot length-wise) because the weight of the camera itself causes significant slippage on the mount."
2,didn't last long,I originally bought this a year ago to use it for when I run ems. Brightness and battery life were all true for this product. The manufacturer claimed it would not break. Well it did and in only six months and when I really needed it to work. When I needed it I went to click it on and when I did the bulb and batteries came out the front. It seams the black top developed a crack and the whole thing came apart. Don't get this one there are others out there that are better constructed.
4,Handy little flashlight,"I recently purchased one of these handy little flashlights. The size is just right for carrying around in my jacket/vest pocket. I carry this flashlight with me almost every minute of the day. For a small 3 LED light it provides good, but not great, illumination.My only real complaint is the odd batteries used. I would have preferred AA batteries."
1,"Um, 10 plus 2 plus 10 is 22","How gimmicky can you get? He calls it twelve seconds, its really twenty two seconds, can't even be straight about that. The whole thing is a rehash of everyone else's work."
4,interesting techniques,"a very easy to follow book. it is right to the point and very clear. the exercises are tough and they make you work. if you want to sweat then this is for you. and amazon is the place to get this book, i really looked around for a good deal and no one beats amazon. this book is worth it."
5,Rave Review for Jorge's latest success!,"As I was walking through Barnes & Noble a couple of weeks ago, I stopped and was flipping through the new book. There were a couple ladies standing there and one exclaimed ""Hey; you're IN this book."" It was with great pride that I could tell them to purchase the book and be prepared for GREAT success! This is not a diet. This is a lifestyle. One you can adapt to your busy schedule and see almost immediate results in how you look and feel. I think I may be the oldest participant but it didn't matter. This is a plan that ANYONE can succeed with! Thank you Jorge and Team!"
1,Shame on Me!!,I am an IDIOT! Hook Line & Sinker! I fell for the Amazon reviews and purchased FOUR copies of this stupid and USELESS book. The highest and best use of the book was to use it to ignite the logs in our fireplace!!
2,Same as the Power of 10 workout,"The 12 second sequence workout, is not a new idea. There is a book out by Adam Zickerman and Bill Schley that is called the Power of 10, that was published in 2003. This is the same concept as the 12 second sequence. They even recommend the 2 times a week workout and then you can go down to 1 time a week. Again, it is exactly the same elements. Slow, controlled movements. You do 10 seconds into the exercise and 10 seconds down. So if you are doing an arm curl, you slowly, controlled, move the arm up for 10 counts and then repeat down for a very slow, controlled 10. Again, this book was published in 2003, so sorry Jorge, this is not a new concept. Funny thing, too, they also recommend eating 6 times a day and not going over 4 hours between eating - sound familiar, as well?"
4,"This is nothing new, but it is good stuff","Although the author claims that he is the creator of this slow exercise, this is not true. This slow exercise actually started in the early 80's with a Nautilus research study. We have been doing this workout in Indianapolis @ Exercise Inc. for a while now. Heavy weights and lifting to failure are the keys to building muscle and burning calories."
1,Impossible to follow!,"The principle of the book is resistance training. But, it is too much reading and too many stages to follow in a book. Maybe the DVD is more appropriate"
2,Body For Life Repackaged,"I really like Jorge Cruise but was disappointed to find his new book to be almost identical to Bill Phillip's Body for Life (only more complicated and less inspiring). There is even a $100,000 challenge and ""free day"" included in the plan!BFL works, no doubt this will too. This is not the miracle new find it was hyped to be. Same stuff, different spokesperson."
4,Good book,"This book had some good reviews and some bad ones. I personally liked it. It shows images of the workouts, gives good examples and puts you on a strict regimen if you're ready for it. Jorge has been there and is trying to share his wisdom as to what worked for HIM. it's not going to work for everyone. I'm pleased with the book and can't wait to incorperate it with the DVD I have."
3,Didn't realize this when I bought it,"Somehow I missed this when I ordered the DVD-it is only the first week of exercises on the DVD - so only 2 full workouts - the rest are in the book, but I like to follow along with visuals & they are not on the DVD-but it was definitely my error. Instead, I purchased the VIP plan on the website & this gave me the entire 8 weeks of exercises-more $$$$, but it's the whole workout."
3,Simple,"This is the second smoothie book I've check out from my local library. The first I didn't care for, despite it's title implying it would be the only such book you'd need for smoothies, as most of recipes seemed to contain a laundry list of ingredients. This book was much more appealling in that the recipes were simple, often containing on three or four ingredients. There are some ingredients that may be harder to come by, but by and large I don't think there's anything terribly exotic. If someone is looking for a collection of ""anytime"" smoothie recipes, then this isn't the book for them as not all the fruits can be found year round in many grocery stores.Also, as others have noted, the photos in the book are excellent and the layout is quite appealing."
3,OK SMOOTHIES,"This is a good smoothie book. I have purchased many Smoothie recipe books in the past and this one by far has the best format with great pictures. I found four recipes that are my favorite smoothies of all time. Black Beauty, Polynesian Power Punch, Kiwi Kiss, and Uncanny Cantaloupe are must try smoothies. I have tried all 43 of the non-alcoholic smoothies in this book. Although the titles of these smoothies are creative and enticing some of the recipes could use a make-over. But you will not be disappointed if you buy this book."
2,Cement Truck rip-off,"Boy, what a rip-off! The dimensions of this toy are never listed. You would think for 20 bucks you would be getting something at least a foot long. It is the size of a matchbox truck! I'm returning it immediately!"
5,Solid Christmas Awesome,"This cd is really freaking good. If you like Mannheim Steamroller, well, this is more of it. It's one of my favorites."
5,A different sound of Christmas,I great disc I found a few years ago. Lent it to a friend and I didn't have the heart to ask for it back.I would highly recommend this for the holiday season
4,Nice selection of songs to listen to,"I bought this CD for a relatively low price at a music store. I have the Live and Christmas Angel albums, so this was the first actual studio CD of theirs that I bought. I had heard Joy to the World and Angels We Have Heard on High before. Other tracks I like on this CD are Pat a Pan, Rudolph the Reindeer and Jingle Bells. I came into the Mannheim Steamroller fan appreciation late in the game. But I must say, they do a great job of interpreting Christmas songs and putting their own spin on them."
4,It's in the AIRE!!!!,"The holiday albums of Mannheim Steamroller continue to impress, with ""Christmas in the Aire"" from 1995 being their third holiday album up to that point in time.The track ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" is quite simply one of the most perfect Mannheim songs you will ever hear, next to the all time classic and radio standard Deck the Halls from the 1984 debut album. This one is a must for any Christmas fans playlist. Joy to the World is another strong track on this record. Los Peces En El Rio is now a Holiday standard for me. What a song.I would say that I enjoy ""Christmas in the Aire"" slightly more than the second Steamroller Christmas from 1988. The keyboards are in perfect form, the percussion is great as always, and the overall production is smooth and crisp.If you enjoy this one, then you are in for a treat with ""Christmas Song"" from 2007."
2,No Joy in the Aire,"The first two Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums were absolute classics. Sadly, Christmas in the Aire is just a feeble attempt to generate some more sales by cashing in on Mannheim's previous fame. Save your money and stay away from this album."
5,Beautiful Renditions of Christmas,"The first time I heard this album was over a store's PA system. It was the first time I had HEARD of Mannheim Steamroller. I fell in love with the music, and had to have the album. I bought it that same day!!! Now I have 3 of the Christmas albums, and intend to purchase some of their other albums as well. I think they are GREAT!!"
5,Powerful,"In my opinion, this album is worth it for just two songs: ""Joseph Dear Oh Joseph Mine"" and ""Jingle Bells."" Not that the other songs are low quality, by any means. ""Jingle Bells"" doesn't even sound like itself; Mannheim Steamroller took this bouncy little tune and transformed it into something very dramatic and emotional. This is my personal favorite among the Steamroller Christmas albums."
4,Pretty darn good except for the last track,"What in the world was MS thinking when they did that sloooow version of Jingle Bells? It's ""Jingle Bells on Valium"". However the rest of the tracks are good listening, so I do recommend this"
3,"OK, but...","Mannheim Steamroller sure knows how to milk a winning formula, don't they?Well, maybe I am being a bit cynical, but all of this starting to sound a somewhat contrived. Sure, I think Christmas music is some of the best music on Earth, but there is only so much that I can stand of Mannheim's interpretations of these songs.I bought the first Christmas album. The other two I received as gifts. The first one is still the best, in my opinion. And even that one suffers from some overly-synthesized junk like their version of ""Deck The Halls."" It gets a bit irritating after a while, and I reach for my Nat King Cole Christmas album, or something along those lines."
4,A must read,"As I opened this book, I was prepared to read a few hundred pages worth of insults geared towards conservative, religious, or otherwise ""non feminist"" women. I was pleasantly surprised with the fairness and respect that Burkett afforded her subjects.My only complaint is that the section on religious women in America focused too heavily on ""fundamentalist"" Christians. An expanded chapter on American Muslims, as well as a chapter on Orthodox Jewish women would have been much more interesting and representative.It may be asking too much, but it would be nice to see this book, or sections of it, included in women's studies classes. The voice of the conservative woman is too often dismissed, and Burkett's book is a much needed forum."
4,"Good info, fun read","Ms. Burkett has written a very entertaining book that is half political analysis and half human interest. I thought she gave a very objective, journalistic report of what is REALLY going on in the mind of the US women. She didn't always, in my view, reach the right conclusions, for instance I think in her summary she gives a little too much credit to feminism, but overall a real education and enlightenment. She is a skillfull and honest writer. I highly adivise anyone interested in politics to read it!"
3,CHECK FOR AVAILABILITY!!! Decent Karloff starter pack!,"This collection might not be available so check with the seller first. The reviews suggest that this box set has somewhat better picture & sound than the ""15 Frighful Films"" box set, but I can't verify that. Now that I have an LCD TV, I try to get all of my flicks with the highest quality picture & sound available and ALL OF THE FILMS IN THIS COLLECTION ARE AVAILABLE SEPERATELY, so do your research. This box set is a great way to inexpensively explore the works of one of the greatest genre actors of the 20th century. But if you are seriously building a Karloff collection and you care about picture and sound quality, well... as they say, you get what you pay for ~"
1,Can't buy it if you want it!,Why is this offering still on Amazon? I ordered it & was told the dealer has none & canceled my order. So why is it still being offered?
3,Back to Planetary (7/10),"Another worldwide secret organization that specializes in obscure events. Why doesn't he just go back to planetary and give the series the attention it deserves.......I always get so excited everytime I see a new Warren Ellis novel, but I have to say, few and far between are worth it in my opinion. Not consistent.Re-readability: 7/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read. Something can be awesome, but not something I am going to frequenty re-read (Maus), or it can be horrible, but I might still re-read it (Global Frequency).*"
1,Not good,Purchased these shoes at the end of September. There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use. I don't subject them to a lot of wear and tear; I work at a desk. This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month. Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again.
1,What's up with the Skechers Quality?,"The day I got these, I put them on and pressed down with my thumb on top of the shoe; I wanted to see how much toe-room I had (everyone does that, right?). My thumb created an indent, essentially caved-in part of the toe area that I still cannot get to 'pop out'.I bought these to replace a nearly identical pair of Skechers that I purchased in '04 that lasted 7 years! These ones won't make it through one season. I question whether the Leather Upper is actually leather at all! It feels like shiny cardboard."
1,Poor quality shoe,"I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months. The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops. The initial wearing of the shoe was painful, pinching at pressure points on the foot. After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably, but obviously not for very long. These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China. Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control. I am very disappointed!"
4,Great shoes,"The shoes feel rigid for a while when new, but with some time they conform to a very comfortable fit. They are durable and last well, and at a very good price. You will need to replace the laces within the first year of every day use. For any kind of shoe, I also recommend at least a thin sole insert to increase the longevity of the inside sole."
3,Co. Issue,Stylish design. Light Weight. Steeltoes bend awkwardly. It's true; you get what you pay for.
5,Just Perfect,"I have purchaced this item and it is great! Excellent price and great, quality. Very comfortable to wear an I love it. I can recommend it to anyone who is seeking comfortable boots for cheap price!"
2,fell apart,"I love Skechers shoes and I owned many in my life time, but this paid did not hold up, just couple months of wear the soles came loose well before the shoe got any use and wear."
5,the best working shoes,"strong, comfortable, very resistance sole. this is my second pair they are practilly indestructible, i love this shoes, the best of their kind."
2,"Very narrow shoes, they seem solid though.","I guess my feet are a little wider than most, but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes. These are so tight I cannot even wear them. I wear Converse Chuck Taylors all the time and they are snug, but these just hurt the moment I put them on. So if you have big feet, try these on in a store before ordering. Other than that they look like decent shoes, especially for the price."
4,"Functional, longer break in",I've been using these shoes for work for about a month. They are comfortable but took a little longer to break in than expected.
4,Shoes are Great!,These shoes really kick butt. I've been wearing them for two years straight and they feel more comfortable with every month that passes. Most importantly they are so durable!
3,Cracking and Peeling within first hour of wearing!,"Great looking shoes, husband loves these and finds them very comfortable .. Run true to size - gets a pair or two every year!12/27/21 Well they still are a good looking shoe BUT my husband wore them for the first time this morning and the top of both shoes started peeling and cracking -within first hour of wearing!! Be warned something is up with the ""leather"" ..I read some other reviews seems we are not the only one who has had this problem!"
1,Two months of wear and the leather is wearing off!!,"I bought these for my husband to wear to work. He loved the fit (he has a very wide foot) and found these shoes to be comfy. I bought them because they were Skechers.He came home a couple of days ago and the leather has ""peeled"" off the top of one shoe and is beginning to peel off on the other. It's very noticeable, as it is peeling off the toes! They look horrible. Now, I need to find him another pair to wear to work. I won't buy any more Skechers!"
2,Beware! These shoes crack on top after a few months!!!!,"After only 3 months of non heavy-duty use, they have cracks on the top. Very disappointed in this, something you shouldn't see this early on. Will look for another brand next time I purchase something similar."
1,Never buy it again,I bought 2 pairs brown and black and the problem was the same. They didn't last for two months. Dont be fool and look for another one.
2,finshing is not as pictured,"the size is ok, it's comfortable and everything is ok except for the finishing. I ordered the ""Brown"" one which doesn't shine, and I got the shiny brown."
5,perfect work shoe,I'm on my feet all day as a Central office tech. My work has me crawling on the floor to climbing ladders.I've bought 3 pairs of these shoes in multiple colors because they give my feet support and protections. There is also enough room in the shoe to add orthotics which has helped my lower back.
2,painful!,"looks nice, but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes."
3,Skechers Men's Alley Cat,"I have purchased Sketchers in this style the last few years, perfect look for work and casual wear. They are comfortable to wear even during long periods of walking. To this point I have not had any issues with Sketchers, this particular shoe however the sole has split in the right shoe after 3 months. I would like to make sure that you are aware that I do walk approximately 3 to 4 miles per day in these shoes and they are perhaps just not built for that type of wear. Other than that which was most likely less due to a design flaw than it was an issue with it being used outside of it's purpose, it's a great shoe and I will be purchasing another pair."
4,Good Solid Shoes,"These are very good solid shoes. I've won these type issues for several years and have really no complaints. It's one of those items that when you go out and shop for a replacement, you always look for the same type. Since I started wearing them, they have become fashionable. Initially everyone thought that they were a bit clunky and reminiscent of work shoes. Quality one out. Now the shoes and its type are very fashionable and almost every major manufacturer has a style of this type. Good stuff. In summary, it is a very good shoe, very durable, and I think good looking."
4,"nice looking, comfortable for daily walking","the shoes is very easy to clean. Elevated thick sole, it makes you look like higher than you are actual is.comfortable for medium and short term walking. However, for the artificial leather, it's a bit hard afterlong time walking."
2,Quality Came Up Soort,I bought a pair of shoes for office work and I have been disappointed ever since. I have owned several other Skecher models and have been somewhat happy with them but these shoes have been downright horrible after about a month's use. My biggest complaint is the squeakiness on the left shoe. The comfort level also is not so great as the back of the shoe rubs on the back of my heal.The shoes are actually quite good looking and the materials are nice. I'm not sure if its hit and miss with Skechers or if this particular model has design deficiencies.
5,Great shoe,Heavy duty and VERY comfortable. I'm really rough on shoes. I've had these only a short time but can tell already they are well made and will last. Great value!
5,Scandalous is Fabulous,"From the gripping opening all through the lush prose, SCANDALOUS is a great tale of two lovers unexpectedly married...who, just as unexpectedly, find themselves in love. Katherine and Dominic tugged at my heartstrings and made me grab for ice water to cool down. The cast of supporting characters is deliciously devious. In the race to a satisfying conclusion, amid Dominic's doubts about himself as an individual and his place in his family, is a wonderful love story about understanding and acceptance. Jenna Petersen is a great new voice in historical romance!"
1,Scandalously Bad,"Ugh, I did not make it through the first chapter before giving up. Juvenile writing, simplistic story telling, blah plotting. I skimmed through the book trying to find something redeeming, but failed. In researching how I had come to buy this book (Amazon hype being my typical downfall)I discovered that Ms. Peterson also writes erotic romance under the name Jess Michaels. Sometime ago I read her book ""Everything Forbidden"" and thought it was pretty good for that genre. (I must have then discovered the Peterson/Michaels connection and ordered this book.) Anyway, happy to find something positive to say - light your fire with ""Everything Forbidden"" while avoiding the ""Scandalous""."
1,Mundane and Underwhelming,"Not that I expect Henry James when I read a romance novel, but I expect a better quality writing than found in the pages of ""Scandlous"" by Jenna Petersen. The characters are poorly developed. The dialogue is stilted and unimaginative. There is not wit, there is no spark, there is no tension, and there is no need to turn the next page. Avoid this book."
3,A sweet love story,"'Scandalous' is a historical romance and a great start for Jenna Petersen. Katherine was engaged to Cole but days before they were to marry his first wife returns from the dead. Cole makes a bargain with Dominic his younger brother to marry Katherine. The love scenes and lies are many. Over all this,is a good novel and I would look for more books from this author."
1,I agree with Tregatt's review...,"This book was very dissappointing and very dark.Actually depressing.A marriage built around lies, blackmail, scandal and hate. Need I say more. The hero(a by blow) married the heroine so he could get the manor where he was conceived from his half brother who was supposed to marry the heroine. Not a very promising start to a romance.I'll save you a lot of time-this story is headache inducing. This was one debut that Avon should have sent back for a rewrite:( Take my advice-save your money and skip it:(no stars:("
3,"Final, and best","I think that ""Rock You To Hell"" featured Grim Reaper's best songs, which goes a really long way towards respecting this band. Sure, this record is produced towards the hair-metal crowd, but that was basically this band's gist anyway. Grim Reaper were simply an Iron Maiden wanna-be band in essence. They had nothing to do with thrash and even less to do with death metal. Without a real style of their own, they came off as a slightly rougher Iron Maiden cover band, and after this album (probably their best song-wise), Grim Reaper just stopped their existence and faded into history. But they were not bad, in fact they were one of the best in what they did. If there ever was a truly worthwhile hair metal band, it would definitely be Grim Reaper."
1,"""brush your teeth and go to bed""","This CD includes two tracks that run throughout the Troma film ""LUST FOR FREEDOM"". It's a women's prison flick and it's hilarious. It's not supposed to be, but it is. Two songs off this cd, ""Lust for Freedome"" and ""Rock you to Hell"" play on a loop through most of the movie, especially the road shots or chase scenes. There is a lyric ""Brush your teeth and go to bed"" on the ""Rock you to Hell"" song and you hear this five whole times throughout ""Lust for Freedom"", one of the funniest movies ever."
4,Wright detialed an image of a black family in the south,"I'm a sophomore in high school, and in choosing the novel Black Boy as one to research for my American Literture class, I found it to be a concise and well-written peice that displayed Wright's perception of growing up as a black boy in the south. Wright captured each moment from when he was four up to being nineteen, and the way he percieved each event and then interpreted it in his writing really enthralled me. His writing contained detailed experiences that were told from his stand point then and knowing what he knew then. Wright's emotions and opinions are scattered all throughout the book and have influenced and changed my beliefs of the early 19th century."
5,The Best Book,"This book Black Boy (American Hunger) is one of the best books that I have ever read. It talks about a subject that is near my heart even though I am not African American. It's contents are spoken from the heart of the author, Richard Wright. He tells the truth about how it was and not about how it could of been. I recommand this book to anyone and everyone. This book should be read no matter the background of the beliefs of a person."
1,awful book for 7th graders,"One of our children was assigned this book to read for 7th grade honors English class.This is ridiculous for 12 year olds to be reading a book like this; the language, adult situations, anti-semitic portions, use of 'the N-word', and general tone made it TOTALLY inappropriate for children to be reading."
1,Passe Communist propaganda.,"If not ever-so politically correct, this dreadfully turgid piece of agitprop would be deservedly forgotten. Surprisingly condescending one dimensional characterization of its black victim: Anna Sewall's Black Beauty is portrayed as more of a person than is Wright's Bigger Thomas. Read INVISIBLE MAN, not this crap."
1,te-di-ous,"I had to read this book for my English class, but thank God I didn't have to finish it. It was the most tedious and boring book i have ever picked up. it just went on and on about struggles and the unfairness of the world, blaming everything on the shallow attidudes of white people. The author reminds us on every page of his superiority and frankly, the style of writing is far too dry to be enjoyable. If you like to read about struggles in a report format with solid facts and arrogant statements about superiority because of those struggles, then by all means, read it. It works as well as any prescription sleepaid, if not better"
3,Black Boy,The book Black Boy deserves three stars. I thought the book was sort of interesting to me and it was sort of boring to me too. All the parts to the book were hard to understand. Not many kids my age thought this book was that easy to understand either. The book was good about bringing out interesting thoughts on how racism is brought towards everyone's culture. Richard Wright was outgoing with bringing out his own thoughts in this book and the way black people were treated as well as racist the feelings towards other people.
3,took too long to ship,"It took forever to get the book. When I finally did get it, it was in decent condition."
4,The book was good despite some boring areas.,"I read the book for my english class and despite the many pages, the book kept me interested most of the time. Some parts kept me reading for hours and other parts made me fall asleep, but it was worth it! It really gave me an idea of what colored minorities went through in the early 1900s."
5,Great book sample.,"This is definitely a book I'd be interested in reading. The first chapter is very interesting, and it getsbthe reader going."
4,Intriguing,"I read the text in 4 days. It was full of life, even when death tried to knock on its door."
5,Fantastic,"I read Black Boy years ago and wanted to refresh my memory of the book. The author has a way of taking you into his world. I was rivited to the pages as I was all those years ago when I first read the book. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old."
2,The Book is Better,"I bought this for my son who had to read it for a school assignment. We were going on a car trip and he thought it might be good to listen to in the car rather than reading the book. The book-on-tape (CD) is very slow moving and after just a few chapters, he reverted to the actual book. The reader is slow and plods along and its actually quicker to read the real book."
5,MUST READ,THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK AND I WILL DESCRIBE IT AS A CLASSIC. IT'S NOT RECOMMENDED TO LIGHT WEIGHT READERS.
3,**Good For Adults--Not Kids**,I ordered this book because it was on my nephews book-report list. It's a good book. But it is full of bad language. I think it's an adult book--with a very compelling story. But completely not for kids. I know kids hear bad language all the time. But to have it presented to them by a 'trusted' adult--gives it a kind of condoning that it doesn't need.
3,A little long on shipping,"The book was in excellent condition and exactly as described. However, I ordered this book about the same time i ordered 3 other items and I recieved this one about 2 weeks behind the other items. Although it was delivered during the suggested shipping time, it still seemed a rather lengthy wait for one book. I suggest using a different shipping service. I needed this book for school and it came in time but just barely!"
4,Excellent description of negro life in the 1920's,"""Black Boy"" is a great autobiographical book written by Richard Wright. Richard, the main character in the story, goes through many trials and tribulations in finding what he loves to do- write. The description of the hardships of negro life in the 1920's and how discrimination ran rampant was excellently described by Wright....the only flaw is maybe a little overexaggeration going on in the descriptions of racism and other hate from whites towards blacks. Richard Wright descibes well though the trials and tribulations of an average negro in American society in that time period. This book is great for teenagers; over the age of 16 though. I say this because vulgar language is constant throughout the story and a couple sex scenes are described explicitly in the book. This is a must-read for young adults."
5,"Great Flashlight, highly recommended",I bought this flashlight over a year ago after my last Streamlight (the regular stinger) got crushed. I use it every night that I work (law enforcement) and I have found that it is the brightest rechargeable out there.I can get the charge to last approx 4 to 5 nights of sporadic use and it will easily go for several hours of continuous use.Overall it was a great investment.
5,Outstanding service once again,Once again Amazon has not disappointed me. An outstanding flashlight (my second one of these) at an outstanding price. The delivery was prompt as usual.
5,Ultra Stinger Flashlight,The Ultra Stinger flashlight is light weight and provides excellent lighting in tight places. The battery lasts and the output does not seem to dim over the time that I use it. Having an ajustable focus is handy in certain situations. I would buy it again.
5,Brightest rechargeable flashlight around.,"This is an awesome flashlight. If you want a police flashlight that is capable of throwing a focused beam a very long distance then this is the light for you. Brighter yet smaller and lighter weight than the famous MagChargers. The Ultrastinger has a better beam even at the widest ""flood"" adjustment than the MagCharger as well due to its partially stippled (orange peel texture) reflector. Though the flood adjustment is certainly not the strong point of this light. That would definitely be its long-throwing capabilities which you really have to see to appreciate! The only thing I would change if I was Streamlight would be to design it with Lithium-Ion batteries instead of the Ni-Cads. Still though, the Ni-Cads are supposedly pretty good, and not prone to ""memory"" if you believe the data provided in the manual. And plus they're pretty cheap to replace if they do wear out."
4,"Expensive product , but works OK, and CS excellent","I decided to buy this $100. flashlight for a favorite grandchild. It looks very ""police"" like and I figured that the kid would like it. He did and took it to summer camp. It stopped working after 2 weeks.So why am I giving it 4 stars? Excellent customer service. I called them up after the summer, they told me where to mail it to, and promised to expeidte the repair/replacement. Which they did."
2,Not as bright as I had hoped.,"It is nice and heavy, easy to charge but not near the brightness it should have. I wish I bought the LED one."
3,"Great quality build, disastrous bulb","The quality of the build on this torch is tremendous. In the past month I have mounted it on my mountainbike for night rides, terrific; I have done thrilling night runs along the banks of the Hudson, and it has undoubtedly lit the way beautifully. But after just one month the bulb burns out, Grrrr! I am not returning it, I will go for a replacement bulb and hope the first was dodgy. But I would like to hear if others have had the same issue!?Purchased it on Amazon."
3,"very bright, super hot, short battery","bulb very fragile and expensive and hard to find locally. bulb so hot that it melted its own lens, charges in car or home, well built but poorly designed, really skinnier than pictures show, as big around as the middle of a pool cue. lightweight, and waterproof so far."
1,The $100 Flashlight arrived without a bulb. You've got to be kidding!,I'm not happy at all - to spend that much money and wait a full week for delivery and have the flashlight arrive without a bulb. What a joke.I'll be returning this item and you can bet it won't take me a full week.
1,Amazon reshipped defective product to me! OUTRAGEOUS!,"I got my Ultrastinger from Amazon today. It has a cracked/torn rubber nipple over the on/off switch, and from all the fingemarks and other tell-tale little marks on it, it's clearly a USED, PRE-OWNED item. Other evidence: the product box was not shrink-wrapped or sealed as it should be, and the battery was fully charged (new flashlights do not come with fully charged NiCad batteries).I am outraged that Amazon would re-ship a returned, defective item, but that's exactly what has happened. This makes me very wary of ordering from them again. I immediately ordered that UPS come to pick this up and take it back at no charge to me. Now I have to ""wait 7-12 days"" AFTER they get this POS back before I get a refund. Nice.Also, now that I've seen the way the rubber switch cover fails, I've decided not to get this product anyway. I'll have to look into another manufacturer."
3,extremely short...,"well, the cd just came today. my initial reaction is good. not yea! whoopie! good! rather, just a regular ol' good--a little above satisfactory.Honestly, I am pretty surprised by that. When i watch the movie, i find the accompanying music captivating, but listening to just the music w/o the movie is... well, it is just not the same.my opinion is buy the book! tape the movie on hbo.. and if you really have money to burn, donate some of it to charity."
4,Sphere Soundtrack,This soundtrack brings back the memories of watching the movie in real time. I like the fact that it is all music and no voices.
3,Lovley music - but why only 30 minutes?,"This music is so well-made that I do actually find it surpricing that this CD is not much longer than a half hour. But, you can't get everything...The music itself is very good, just as horrofying as in the Event Horizon Soundtrack (which I would like give 5 stars in all). But very short. When a track i finished it doesn't really feel like it should be finished, most are even under two minutes long.but if you are just searching for perfect Hallowen-music, and are not out here for a long CD, you should really buy this one. AND the Event Horizon Soundtrack."
3,Classic Goldenthal but way too short,"I'm guessing the reason this CD is so short is that to cut down on expensive orchestra time the film used alot of repeated cues. That's probably also why the main theme, which is so noteworthy in the film, only appears once on the CD which is a shame. Or maybe it's partly because Goldenthal must have been feeling a little nevouse about the fact that it sounds alot like he fell asleep listening to Elfman's Edward Scissorhands the day before he penned the theme.The score also contain some haunting strings as well as the madness we know and love from Godenthal but overall I would only recommend this score for Goldenthal fanatics and even then, try and get it second-hand.By the way Goldenthal better watch out 'cos newcomer Don Davis is starting to compete in the clank and bang musical stakes."
5,A gem here and there,"This book is to be read by any one who loves Adrienne Rich. There are particular poems which really impress and touch your heart. Nevertheless, if you want to make a choice between the latest book, ""A School Among the Ruins"" I'd suggest you to read A School. But still Foz has its own stature."
2,"""If wishes were horses the beggaars would ride,and you can only eat an apple one bite at a time.""",Of the many episodes of this series;I find I enjoy most of them;but in some cases they just don't measure up.This episode has a weak storyline and even weaker characters.It leans more towards being a mystery novel rather than an Old West Western.The storyline is very convoluted and heavily padded with endless side issues over the Civil War and chemical discussions over making nitroglycerine to the extent that it gets to be a bore.I had to force myself to continue to the conclusion;and when finally arriving at the end found a sense of relief.This episode is anything but typical and if one does decide to suffer through it;don't let it discourage you from reading others in tne series.
3,"Polk Audio RM6751 Satellite Speaker (Single, Titanium)","This speaker has different type of wire connection with my existing speakers. It has the press down and insert type (my previous set has the screw & banana plug combo type). I have to cutoff my banana jack for hooking up.Other than that issue, speakers are working fine when I upgraded my set (RM7650) to 7.1 system."
1,Awful. One word is enough.,"Ugh, painful to watch. Instead of an enlightening piece on Morrissey and his music, we get a bunch of interviews with dumb, monosyllabic fan kids plodding through half-baked speculations on Morrissey's sexuality, hairstyle and politics."
3,"Fans Of Allan Holdsworth, Check This Out","Not the greatest Soft Machine album ever, though whatever the line-up, the band was always a quality brand name for fine challenging music.The compositions aren't quite as exciting as usual, despite fine playing, especially from Jenkins, Marshall, and Holdsworth. It had been a long time since the group had featured a guitarist, and Allan Holdsworth more than fit the bill. Mike Ratledge takes a little bit more of the back seat on this one, and it was about time. Although he's a fine organist, his 'sound' was getting a little overused by the group after awhile. The final track is very different for Soft Machine, almost an Eno like ambient drone."
3,A half decent book,"A good book, but not for beginners. I purchased the Circuit Boards from FAR Circuits and went gang busters. Found numerous mistakes throught the book. Some components are also very hard to find. The RF power transistors alone cost 100.00 US. Had to debug main oscillators and SSB oscillators as well. My friend and I have also redesigned various components to add stability. Randy's web site is gone ? So the updates and corrections are no longer available. If you know what you are doing and have access to RF generators, Scopes and the like, then this may be for you. Otherwise for a first timer there are some other kits that will be much better. (VE3SLJ). Reach me through RAC, or the Call Sign Database for questions."
3,Contemporary Pre-GED Mathematics (Contemporary's Pre-GED Series),Contemporary Pre-GED Mathematics (Contemporary's Pre-GED Series)explanation of problems are vague at best.Had to purchase another math book for better intstructions
5,A Must Read Book,"I thought this book was fantastic. From the time I started to the end of the book I could barely put it down. It also scared me a little when I realized, ""Wow this could really happen."" I highly recommend this book and look for more from the author."
5,Really good!!!,"Watch Them Die, I tought that this band plays metalcore, boy, i was wrong. Great thrash in the vein of 80's thrash bay area bands, great guitars, perfect vocals. Recommended!!!"
3,"Some likeable moments, but it doesn't soar.","A year ago I got ""Cole Porter: A Musical Toast,"" a set that becomes more enjoyable with repeated listenings. So I got this production of Lerner, Lowe, & Lane, anticipating continued listening pleasures. Regrettably, this production is not on the same high level. The arrangements aren't quite as sophisticated, the performers aren't quite as impressive, and the sound quality isn't at the same standard as its predecessor.I'm sure a lot of time and engergy were poured into this effort; and I wish I could give it a better recommendation; but there's not enough really good moments to justify the expense of this set.There is, however, one reason why I'm glad I did get this CD.It contains a song ""In the Broken Promised Land of Fifteen,"" which is a real delight."
2,* Difficult to Understand *,"The same folks who made the fabulous Secret Language of Relationships, Secret Language of Birthdays and Secret Language of Destiny also wrote this book. What a huge difference in quality. This book is difficult to understand ... not straight forward like the other books. I would not recommend this to buy until you have gone to the library to look it over first."
5,Steel type,great knife.....<<for those of you who do not know on these kershaw blurs if yours has a date on the blade July 2007 and before the blade uses 440A steel (average) if the date is after July 07 will now be 13C26 steel (very good)...and if your blade has a date of March 2009 on up or does not have a date on the blade the knife uses 14C28N Sandvik steel (great).>>Mine are both 14C28N!!
3,Ink Smudged,"I ordered this for my lab. We have an Epson large format printer - Epson Stylus Pro 10,000. We've never had a smudging problems until I purchsed this paper. Even an hour later the color ink will smudge if you rub hard enough. Very nice paper look wise - people liked the higher gloss, but not worth it if it smudges."
2,Inferior Sequel,"The injection of a plot into the world of the Avatar destroys the charm that was present in ""God's Debris.""Much like the ""Left Behind"" series, attempts at suspense are met with skepticism and rarely end with surprise, as Adams uses the deus ex machina and the nature of the Avatar's unquestionable logic to minimize suspense. As a result, the chapters tend to drag on. ""God's Debris"" allowed the reader to relate to the protagonist and feel engaged. The globe-hopping antics of the same character in this book only makes the reader want to skip to the ending.While some interesting ideas are touched on, don't expect another ""God's Debris,"" because it isn't ""The Religion War."""
5,Excellent Thought-Provoking Quick Read,"While there's nothing philosophically profound here, there is a wonderful book with some excellent twists. I generally don't read fiction, but this book grabbed me from the start and I read it every free moment until I was done.Adams portrays the inevitable escalating conflict when 2 opposing worldviews (each held zealously with certitude) reach their conclusion: immoral devastating war.He covers well the concept of how does a deluded person know if he's deluded? He also repeatedly demonstrates, using interesting dialogs, how many people hold beliefs without having thought it through.This is no philosophical tome (we've got enough of them and they do little to open the eyes of the public), but it will provoke thoughts in any zealots (or non-zealot) mind if they were willing to allow it. This timely book could be given (probably with no offense) to any religious person who's currently thinking their war is moral and God is on their side."
5,thought provoking and up to date,"This book certainly is win for people who are prepared to join a thought experiment.The bottom line almost seems too obvious: The war of the religions can't be won by either side. However, the argumentation, albeit of a more ""theoretical"" nature, is flawless and convincing. A must read for people who are willing to add a point of view that is unlikely to be aired by CNN."
3,Not As Thought Provoking As The Original,"Not as original or thought provoking as the previous book in the series. The previous book, Gods Debris, was more of a thought provoking work than is the sequel, The Religion War. It was ok in its own right, but does not have the same thought provoking impact and is more or less a fairly pedestrian work. It was a pretty short book and a quick read that is ideal for a day at the beach. But, this one will not leave much of an impact on you and you will pretty much forget about it within a few days. Disappointing considering how good the previous book was. I guess he should have stuck to his Dilbert comic strip."
3,Not as good as its predecessor.,"If you're buying The Religion War because of the joy you felt while reading God's Debris, don't buy this book. It's not the same kind of book, regardless of being better or worse. Though the author claims that the book raises important questions to be pondered, the plot itself answers most of them. And usually in a way that makes you wonder if the writer was eager to finish it and do something else. Despite all that, it still has interesting insights and a fairly original plot. You just have to keep in mind that his ""vision"" of the future is a lot related to the fact that he's American and think the country learned a lot (not in terms of lesson, but of intelligence/data) by invading Iraq."
5,The Religion War - A logic experiment?,"This follow-up from God's debris in not a ""thought experiment"" but a fiction that relies on some of the concepts previously discussed in God's Debris. This novel has the Avatar attempting to stop a religious world war that would rip apart the human race. Some of Adam's conclusions seem so logical that it is difficult to dispute that the scenarios they depict would not be inevitable. It is these ""gasp"" moments that compel further reading. Once again he toys with ""free will"" and ultimately leads the reader to ponder that the only universe we could possibly understand is by definition, a delusion. And to fight over a delusion is probably the definition of stupidity. Some powerful ideas to read, which leave any open-minded reader enlightened. Excellent."
4,Decent text,"I used this book for my English 101 class. I thought it would be dry and boring but it was better than I thought. Some of the articles are very interesting, funny, and thought provoking."
4,Love it,The book was in great condition and I love the writings in them. I ordered it for a class but I will continue to review the book because of its content. Thanks.
2,"Good essays, but too liberal for a text book.",This book is commonly used as an english writing class text. It is very liberally biased and does not offer any balance. I would not recommend its use as a text with out using something that provides more contrast.
2,50 Essays pages out of order,"Right in the middle of a Sarah Vowell story ""Shooting Daddy"" is part of a story by Amy Tran (at page 436). Pages 421 - 436 are repeated causing confusion when one of those stores is required reading.This book (50 Essays: A portable Anthology (2nd edition) by Samuel Cohen and published by Bedford/St. Martin should have not left the publisher in this state and customers should not have had to pay full price for this book.It is just too much trouble to try and get my money back or get some sort of other solution as my daughter needs this book every day as her class is a summer class and meets every day.Shame on you Bedford/St. Martins and author Sam Cohen who edited this book. If anyone wants to contact the publisher on my behalf I will not agrue.[...]"
1,Not up to par,"This is poorly made and poorly put together. At certain angles, the blades catch on themselves and jam -- not a safe situation and certainly not useful. This lasted about 10 minutes at our house and then it went back with a new understanding at why the price is so low..."
1,Not for serious use,Is not contructed for serious use. It lasted about five minutes in use. Too many plastic/nylon parts to be used in other that very small grass areas. No weeds.
1,Bought 2 - neither held up........,"Bought one.......used only on grass twice.......it stopped working so I exhanged it for another which was used only on grass once or twice before it quit. In both cases, something inside the shears seems to have broken, preventing the smaller ""trimmer"" nylon gear from turning the larger gear on the cutting blades (the smaller gear just whirls without any effect)."
1,clipper housing,"clipper housing does not hold working parts in, I have had two units and both have the same defect. Very poor quality control by the manufacturing co."
2,Save your money!,"Very little power, has difficulty with thick grass. In short, this product is only slightly faster than pulling out each individual blade of grass by hand. I bought it for close trimming work around a PVC fence. I haven't yet tried the shrub clipper attachment, but if the unit can't power the grass blade I don't have much hope. A sharp pair of manual grass clippers is a better bet."
1,AMERICAN GARDNER CS60- 6VOLT CLIP AND SHEAR COMBO,"I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THIS ITEM WHICH I PURCHASED A FEW YEARS AGO. I FORGOT ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T DO MUCH CUTTING AND THE BATT DID NOT HOLD IT'S CHARGE. I THOUGHT I EMAILED AMAZON BUT DIDN'T GET A RESONSE. BOTTOM LINE, DON'T BUY THIS."
5,Sexuality uncovered,"With this book Dollimore analyzes sexuality in terms of the differing conceptions of Andre Gide and Oscar Wilde. Where Wilde saw surface and performance, Gide saw a representation of essential self. Taking Wilde's side in the argument, Dollimore uses this analysis to deconstruct sexuality as it appears in early texts."
5,Interesting compilation of diverse trans topics,"I really enjoyed reading this book, it has many different trans perspectives and topics all of which will be of interest to anyone interested in transgender stuidies. I particularly liked chapter 3 ""Black Telephones, White Refrigerators: Rethinking Christine Jorgensen"" by the book's editor Dallas Denny as well as chapter 2 ""Transsexualism: Historical Perspectives, 1952 to Present"" Another highlight was chapter 24 that is basically a case study of a young 16 year old transgirl and the final chapter by Richard Green who was the editor of ""Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment"" in 1969 the first compilation on trans studies to be published after Harry Benjamin's ""The Transsexual Phenomenon"" Unfortunately the current price of the book will limit it's distribution but if you are willing to spend +100.00 on a book you will not be disappointed with this one."
4,Smokin' Hard Bop,"This hard bop set from 1960 didn't do too much for me at first. Largely, I think, because I have been listening to a lot of this stuff lately.Then something happened.I listened to this record with the headphones on and I'll be damned if I didn't experience it in a whole new way.Recorded in New York City in July 1960, Spiritsville features a cast of characters that I have not heard a lot from (except for the noteworthy piano player...).Priester was a trombone player. In fact, he's on Coltrane's Impulse debut, Africe Brass. In the manner of Curtis Fuller he does some great work on this record as a lead. Between those two I've come to enjoy that instrument far more than I ever have.Of the records McCoy Tyner played on leading up to this one, none foreshadowed exactly where his tone and style were going as much as this one. Dig his solo work on 'Blue Stride' and 'Excursion'. You'll hear it."
2,Mannheim Steamroller brings nothing new to the table.,"If you do not already own a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CD, this is a fair compilation of music released on Mannheim's previous recordings of Christmas music. However, the tracks sound virtually the same as their earlier Christmas CD's, the only difference being the inclusion of audience applause. My recommendation is to purchase any of the previously released Christmas CD's by Mannheim Steamroller for a more satisfying listening experience."
4,The restored soundtrack from a gem of an old musical,"After only being available as a mono recording, this restored stereo soundtrack CD is just great. Plus you get a couple of tracks that were never available on the original...including Monroe's original tracks, a couple of bonus tracks with Merman and the full track of ""A Sailor's Just A Sailor."" This was Merman's last film musical as well as the last film musical from Irving Berlin. Great songs with great performances by the above as well as dazzling Mitzi Gaynor along with Donald O'Connor and Dan Dailey. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 due to one track which sounds, to my ear, out of sync. Johnny Ray's ""If You Believe"" seems to place the vocal a split second off from the musical track. The plot of the film is just a framework for the music and it's the music that's front and center. Kudos to Varese Sarabande for doing the tech work to make this available."
1,unfair music score!,"there is a strange quality sound ...one cannot really understand why now and then the orchestra sound , instrumental basic sound is weak while the singers are more dominant vocally !it is much more clear when one watch the film!but there is an amazing unfair betrail or trick which is actually illegal !!!it is scandalous that in this c.d. the name of Marilyn Monroe is just a name ! there is no Monroe singing here !!!it is such an ordinary voice placed to replace the beautiful voice of Marilyn Monroe!someone else unknown is singing the songs from the movie under her name!!!one could sue the label!!!terrible , pittifull and embarazzing to sell this ''original sound track'' when it is really not...so !"
1,"annoying ""hidden track"" concept","The music is enjoyable; however, at the end of the last track is two minutes of silence, followed by another song. For people with multi-disc players, like me, silence is expected only after all disks have played. One minute of unexpected silence is even too long, much less two minutes. Such ""cute"" attempts at a hidden track should be discouraged. The additional song should have had its own track, or at least followed the previous song by, say, 10 seconds or less."
3,Another 80's supbar album!,"Even though i was in awe of Vanity's beauty, this album didn't offer a whole lot either. However, ""Mechanical Emotion"" was that joint off of this album. Very nice danceable track. You can hear Morris Day's background vocals on this track as well. This is also another one of those Motown albums that should've been released on cd. I would still go out and cop it too. But not for the price that they are asking for right now. That is way too steep."
4,"Good, incisive political punk rock lives!!","As political and angry as the Dead Kennedys ever were way back when. This band flies low on anyone's radar so the Bush/Ashcroft/Runsfeld crowd may not yet be noticing but the anger at what they are doing is expressed here in the least subtle ways possible. I'd give it 5 stars but at points, some of the lyrics are really tough to discern. But highly recommended. No knock to the Rancids, et al, but this stuff makes them seem almost meek."
1,"Another affront to good taste, bad taste, and your ears","I have no clue how Vortis could ever be compared to Dead Kennedys.The difference between Vortis and DK, beyond the vomit bucketyou'll require when listening to Vortis' filth, is that DKpossessed musical and lyrical talent that made them interesting.Vortis may have political lyrics, but the music is boring,the lyrics befitting a high school band, and the musiciansare horribly untalented flunkies.Final grade : F-, so bad it's not worth laughing at the preview."
4,Worth it for sure,"All the reviews complained that its not perfect to put together - true but once it is - it's a clean looking, really useful addition to a small bathroom. I recommend it."
3,Its not great,"I like the cabinet but the directions were not written well, the package was missing 4 screws (that I needed to put this thing together) and there were other screw in the box that aren't even mentioned anywhere in the manual nor do they fit into anything...and the cabinets door which comes attached to the side already - were uneven..."
2,soft core,"just lightcheap made but descent for the money.Not for power play, just too light and not tall enough if you want to play up high.They will not hold larger than a 14"" cymbal, still fell to the floor, when played holding 14"" chinaBetter for a 10"",12"" cymbal, I guess.Maybe is me.Not the stand."
5,"Excellent Read, Salena!!!!!!!!!!","intrigue,ust, all around good read, have read all of Ms Montgomery's boooks> All have been page turners that I could not put down.Hope your next project is in the works>"
2,Terribly boring,"This is a story about Maggie Potter who, hiding from a scandal in Politics, is residing as an inn keeper in Jerome, Arizona. The inn has a resident ghost, a great-many times removed granny who wants to see her settled in life. The prose was so boring, I had to skip many, many pages just so I could finish. Neither Colby, the male lead nor Maggie had much of personality. Frankly, I liked the ghost better and would have liked to read her story than the current one. Maggie is apparently so loyal, she thinks that it is not the politician's fault for her current predicament. Doormat anyone?or just plain stupid?This is the author's first book for me, and it will most likely be the last."
4,Highly entertaining,"I must admit I was highly amused and entertained by this lightweight romance novel. Of course, being familiar with the beautiful and interesting locale where the story took place helped.I liked the naughty, but not malicious, ghost and found the other characters, including the pets, fun to read about."
2,A Ghost for Maggie,"Haven't finished the book yet; but thought it might be of interest to those that read the book and enjoy Emily Carmichael's work -- Just stayed for the second time in the mansion and visited with some of the ""characters"" which might resemble (or might not) those in the book. While the book may have its flaws; the ambience is only enchanced by staying in Jerome. If truly there was a place for an eccentric ghost, this may be it.Look forward to finishing this book."
2,Cool when its fresh out of the package,I bought these and a few months later the cords started to rip. Then soon after that the sound quality failed and other players could not hear my mic. It is cool for a back up or if you want to save money. But if you're looking for a quality product get something a little more sturdy.
1,WASTE OF MONEY ! CAN'T EVEN GIVE IT 1 STAR,"I bought 3 of these so we would have extra . First one lasted 2 weeks and the second one lasted 1 week.Just stopped working,wireing not torn apart,I can find nothing pulled or lose to cause them to stop working .I know they are cheap but I would expect them to last longer.Will not buy anymore ! Only person wearing them was my 10 yr. old grandson.GUESS YOU DO GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!"
2,Good if it last,"used it a little over 3 months, the speaker was broken. Email to JPQuality, the seller, and got respond very quickly offering a replacement. So far it is working for about one month."
1,Xbox Live Headset,"This headset was horrible, it broke within a week. i switched over to a wireless headset it work great"
3,bought 2,I bought 2 of these. 1 broke when putting it on for the first time. The other is ok but can tell that it is not as sturdy as another brand that I bought.
3,its ok,The headset was good but old style plug in can't have a texting pad connected at the same time was only thing wrong with it as far as shipping and waiting A+ did a fantastic job getting it to my house in a timely fashion.
4,Awesome!,This product is great! It shipped quickly and it worked great. It isn't wireless but the wire is long enough to go about a few feet away from the Xbox 360 system. Remember you won't have any use for it if you do not have an internet connection for your Xbox or points to access it.
4,Stop complaining!,"All these people are dumb. It's a great headset. I got mine wayyyy before the estimated delivery time. And it sounds great online. You get what you pay for. This was cheap, and works great. Even if it didn't work great, it was still cheap. So stop complaining."
1,Total garbage head set.,I bought 4 of these new on ebay. First one didnt last the first night. Second didnt last 3 days. These things are total garbage. Spend $20 on a new original xbox360 headset and save yourself the head ache.
3,"Better setup, but cheaper product than original headset","For some reason, I have gone through 3 of these headsets. They are the cheapest ones out there, and usually don't last more than 2 months or so for me. The only reason I like them is because the mute button is conveniently located at the base of the controller, making it easy to turn your voice on and off with your thumb. The bad part is that this headset is extremely cheap. One of them the wiring came out and stopped working completely, another one the microphone stopped transmitting my voice, but I could still hear people through the headphones. And the one I have now works but randomly. I should probably just get the original xbox 360 headset for $10 more...."
4,Great Price & Fast!,I ordered it right before Thanksgiving. It shipped November 22 and got here November 28. It works and looks new and you can't beat the price. I would recommend it to anyone. Now I can hear my teammates when I play Black Ops 2 (:
3,the headset was just ok,We had the headset for a month than it broke easy. I am sure having kids yanking on and off thier heads didnt help but i was hoping he would have it longer than a month. Yes we can buy another at the low cost they are selling them but still. Money is money!!!!
2,max live headset,cheap broke were it adjust to the size of ur head an people on live told me it makes weird nosies
1,you get what you pay for...,Okay i know this looks ust as good as the headset xbox used to give you but its not. this headset it a lot CHEAPER!! buy this if you know you are getting a good headset lie turtle beaches or trittons in the next week because this lasted me atleast 4 days up to a week but not 2 weeks for sure. so this is a very short term replacement.
5,XBOX ACCESORIES,"I found a good product and just as I expected, I hope to try to finish confirming the product you bought"
4,Excellent Value,"Xbox 360 Max Live HeadsetThis product works like a charm. I didn't realize, however, you only get the voice links NOT the game sound. I highly recommend it."
2,Cheap,"This headset is cheap. It's uncomfortable and only fits on the left side of your head. If you have a larger sized head, the adjustments won't go all the way down to your ear. Just dissatisfied with the product overall."
1,Arrived defective,"Was shipped on time, arrived quickly, however the microphone only kind of works and the earphone doesn't work at all. Not that I'm surprised after only spending 4 bucks, but I was still a little disappointed it didn't work at all."
5,Great deal,"According to my grandsons, these are as good as the expensive ones, except you can by 6 of these to 1 pair of the others. The kids go through the expensive ones as fast as the cheap ones. I will buy these again!"
5,awesome !!!!!!!!!,great for 5 bucks i thought it would be a piece of junk but it turned pit great. the only downside to the headset is that its like new shoes when you put it on its stiff. other than all that its great.BUY THIS NOW!
2,very low quality,"It gets the job done, but it broke with in a few weeks of owning it. It is also not very comfortable."
2,Can't hear much!!!,The audio with these headsets is way quiet. with any amount of other noise in the room you can't hear your teammate talking or if you have the tv turned up to even a low level you can't either. I would spend the extra $$ and get a decent set. these are a HUGE disappointment.
4,Decent Headset for the Price,"Headset works great!Glad I got this one and didn't spend the extra money for the microsoft version. This has the older style mic mute switch located on the controller so you don't have to try and reach for the switch, it's always within a quick thumb reach. Which makes it great for playing in a loud room. Volume is plenty loud"
4,Good for the price,"I got this thing just for use a short time before getting new turtle beaches. After a month I realized that it was sturdy enough and was pretty good as a mic. It is a bit dinky and doesnt have all the quality of a slightly more expensive turtle beach, but its good enough for one that uses it mostly to talk"
4,Thank you. It's performance is excellent.,I needed a cheap headset quick so I came to Amazon. Instead of hurting my wallet I found this seller and can I say it's definitely worth a try. The mic works great and no more echoes or saying something that is not heard by other xbox live friends. Thank you. A+
3,Not original but..,"Its not the original xbox 360 headset BUT it does the job and it works just fine. If you need a headset but dont want to spend the money, i would buy this one."
3,Decent,"It's a decent headset for a decent price. It will hold you up for a while, but if you're picky about quality you should just spend more on a name brand one instead. What got me was the customer response from the company. My first one came in the mail busted so Eforcity sent me another one free of charge. Now that I can't complain about!"
3,Good product,"The product is ok the foam on the ear piece is a little thin but it works well, the company that i order from was on time with product and i like that when i order from companies like this one and i will order from them again.Plantronics Gamecom X10"
1,great while it lasted,"This headset was great while it lasted.My son used it for about 3 days before it broke.The ear piece fell off and would not fit back on.The wires connecting also came apart.This was an inexpensive headset,and I learned,you get what you pay for!"
1,Doesn't work.,"I got the package in the mail, opened it, plugged it in to my controller and it didn't work. No one could hear me and I couldn't hear them. I was defiantly not happy."
1,worst peice of .... ever,i got the headset and when i looked at it i noticed some exposed wires that go into the part that plugs into the controller. i can here other people but they cant hear me. dont waste your time even thinking about getting this headset. worst investment ever....
1,Awful Product,This mic worked for a good ten minutes before stopping completely. This is a completely abysmal excuse for an Xbox headset. The cord even came detached just for good measure to make sure it never worked again.
4,"Not bad at all, especially for the price.","I got this to replace the headset that came with my Xbox 360. To me, they feel about the same weightwise, and this one doesn't seem any flimsier than the Xbox-branded one. The microphone arm isn't as flexible as the Xbox-branded mic, so it can be difficult getting it away from your face, and the headband can be a little snug, but it is adjustable.I only paid 3.99 for everything, shipping included, so I'm really happy with it. I like that the volume and mute control is down by the controller, so it's really easy to adjust with your thumb, instead of fishing around trying to catch the little box on the wire of the Xbox-branded one. People have no trouble hearing me, even if I'm whispering. I've only had static from it once when I first plugged it in, but haven't had any trouble since.Plus, the shipping was REALLY fast. I was impressed.All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase, and I will definitely recommend it to others."
2,Not what I expected,"When I bought the CD I thought that it provided remixes for all the tracks listed. It turns out that it's only 2 of the six tracks. The other 4 are from the album version. The 2 that were remixed were ""Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)"" and ""Blame it on the Boogie."" While ""Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)"" was pretty good, ""Blame it on the Boogie"" is one of the best remixes out there."
3,Pretty Good but when is their gonna be a Best of?,The Jacksons had alot of great jams.just from Destiny&triumph alone not to mention classics like show you the way to go.this set is alright I Liked The Blame it on the Boogie remixe but I want a True Greatest Hits Compilations of this Group.the Mixes are so/so in spots.Heartbreak Hotel is still one of the baddest jAMS THAT Michael ever did.
1,terrible chinese made shoe,"this Chinese made shoe is terrible, i bought this shoe and the upper part of the shoe after few months started to break up, started to pill off. i would not recommend any shoe made in china or this shoe what so ever."
1,Problems with stitching and width,"The medium is actually very very wide, and the stitching on the upper gave way only a month after I bought it. Generally, I like Skechers shoes, but I could only recommend this for people with very wide feet."
3,A bit uncomfortable,"The shoes are good to look at. But it is a little bit uncomfortable to walk. you feel as if you are wearing a large shoe even though it is light in weight. it has nice cushions, however your toe nails start hurting after walking for a long time. If you are buying it for everday use, its a bad idea but good for occasional uses. Personally, I would prefer something more comfortable."
3,Not quite comfortable,These shoes are good quality but a little on the heavy side. My husband used them for work just once and has not worn them since.
1,Shoes failed within 3 months,I have been purchasing Skechers shoes for at least 12 year's and my last 2 pair have failed. The older pair lasted 1 year and the outsole cracked in half across the width of the sole. My latest pair purchased less than 3 months ago had the side seam tear out of its triple stitching. I find this to be unacceptable having 2 pair of shoes fail in 1 year. I work in an office and I sit at a desk 8 hours a day. These are worn maybe 3 days a week. Will never buy this brand again.
2,Buyer Beware!!,"We have bought 2 pairs of these shoes for my husband. Both have fallen apart within six months. My husband enjoyed wearing them for work because they were comfortable, however, within months he had problems with water leaking in his shoes and the leather cracking and breaking apart. Although they look nice and are comfortable, I would expect a longer lifespan for a $60 pair of shoes!"
5,too intelligent,too intelligent just superb performances by these musicians. jazz rock prog fusion or what on earth have they come up with this album.BRILLIANT!!!!
1,Extinct,"This album shows why bands should stop calling thmeselves a name after half the band is gone. Only a third of the band is left and he's not great himself. If you want the real ""Soft Machine"" get the first album and leave this one alone. With this album the re-joined the ""Pink Floyd"" ranks (who the were often compared to) by not knowing when to stop."
5,My first experience with Soft Machine,"This is the first album that I listened to the Soft Machine on radio in my high school age in 1976. I recorded the radio program in a cassete tape and repeated listening it. A few years later, I purchased an analog LP of it finally and repeated listening it. About ten years later, I purchased a CD of it and ....Thus this is one of my favorite albums of the Soft Machine and it will remain as it is through my life. This is truely one of the best Jazz-Rock albums of all. I recommend it not only to the Soft Machine fan, but also every 70's progressive rock funs."
4,Great Jazz Fusion,"One of my favorite Soft Machine albums. If you enjoy Return to Forever, Weather Report, or Herbie Hancock's 70s material, add this to your collection. You'll be glad you did."
5,God's gift to curly hair,"I came across this product at least 10 years ago, and despite the peculiar almost flourescent turquoise color, I tried it. It's amazing. It tames frizz without creating crunchy hair. My only complaint was that it was kinda slimy and hard to wash off my hands. I finally figured out that that is because it is mostly aloe. And just like aloe, it's slimy. But it is magic for the hair. I bought a liter years ago and am just finishing it up, so I'm thrilled to see that it is still made. I have very curly ringlets, but my hair is not thick. Fixative is best used when my hair is damp, but I can even put some on my dry hair when it gets frizzy and it will tame it. Like all curly girls, I've tried everything on the market. This is the best."
4,"Great, but the video is a 5!","I must wholeheartedly agree with Peggy Connor from Cleveland..""The Irish and How They Got That Way"" video soundtrack is so wonderful, I wore out the tape! In fact, I've ordered three tapes just in case!I rate the audio CD just a notch below the video because it has unexplain breaks that can only be understood if one has seen the play or the video.Also, while the entire audio cast is fantastic, I missed the pure lilting voice of Marion Tomas Griffin who was in the video in place of Donna Kane. I don't know which one was actually in the original cast.If ""The Irish and how..."" was ever to return to California, I would live in the theater!James Kirby"

1,Lousy product,"The glasses Amazon sells is not the ones pictured in the ad. The glasses they send are of an inferior quality which I doubt is actually NIKKO. The design on the glass is nearly half the size of the one pictured. I complained after the first set arrived, and Amazon sent a replacement set, NEXT DAY, at no charge to me. I do appriciate them trying to set this right. The replacement set was the same inferior product they had sent the first time. I received a lengthy email, after a second complaint, but Amazon was unable to do anything about this problem at this time, but I think they finally realized they had a supplier problem to deal with."
1,Inferior Product,These glasses are NOT the ones pictured. I have two other sets that I have had for many years. The decal on them is full size and appears to be hand painted. The decals on these glasses just received is about half the size of the original ones and the ones pictured on line. The decal appears that it would peel or wash off easily. Not very satisfied with the product I received. Would not order these or any other product advertised as NIKKO from Amazon again.
5,A modern day Jack the Ripper story.,"This modern day Jack the Ripper movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. James Spader plays a doctor who becomes the primary suspect of Jack the Ripper style murders, which take place 100 years to the day of the original Jack the Ripper murders. Spader did an excellent job in this mystery/suspense role. If you're a James Spader fan, this is a must see movie."
5,Jack's Back,Modern day Jack the Ripper movie with a twist. Well acted. Not a particularly great movie but somehow strangely compelling. I found this movie extremely engrossing and memorable. A must see.
3,Jack's Back,"100 years after London's most notorious crime spree, a copycat killer has taken the city of Los Angeles by storm as he recreates each of Jack the Ripper's bloody murders. Rick looks to clear his twin brother's name after he is mistakingly identified as the killer, which leads him straight into a deadly game of cat and mouse with the real villain! James Spader stars in Rowdy Herrington's Horror debut, JACK'S BACK, from 1988. Sure, Herrington broadcasts many of the film's surprises very early on, but watching the contrived sequence of events play out exactly to the audience's expectations is half the fun! Spader is enjoyable in each of his dual performances, both as the selfless Dr. Westford and as his brazen, streetwise brother, Rick. While it rarely strays from standard convention, JACK'S BACK takes a playful stab at the Horror/Thriller genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,suuuuuuuuuucked,"let me first say that i am a fan of both james spader and cynthia gibb. but they are the only good things about this movie.aside from them the acting is horrible,the direction is horrible,and the story is horrible.i'd like to think that i know a turkey when i see one and for the life of me cannot figure out why this gets such good reviews,especially 5 stars?! those expecting an 80's version of From Hell will sorely be disappointed.nothing really happens in the film and the whole movie is predictable,at least i knew the ending shortly into the movie.so no there are no suprises,no twist ending,ok there is but it's a definite low-grade twist.and by that point,like i,you won't even care.i found myself wanting to see more of cynthia gibb more than anything.if you want to see it for james spader than i can only recommend it for his acting,and even than he's done better.a very disappointing film."
5,Spader is great,"If your a fan of 1980's mystery's wtih James Spader, You'll love this movie. It's a mystery alot of twists and turns, a nice who done it."
2,Please read this before buying this movie!,"Ok people, I'm not the person to write on-line reviews, but the rave reviews that this movie received forced me to write this as a public service to the human race. This movie is NOT good--it doesn't even come close to being a 5-star cinematic experience. Now the movie isn't awful--the acting is solid, so you have to give it some credit. But the people who gave this movie 5 stars are just wrong. There is no point of contention here. Compare this film with any ""classic"" movie and it doesn't compare. Are you telling me that ""Jack's Back"" is on par with ""Psycho""?!?Bottom Line: This movie is a bad movie that is lifted up by some talented performers. Don't believe me? Watch it for yourself and be disappointed like I was."
4,A web developers point of view,"This is a good book. I highly recommend it to web developers. The nature of the topic means that it's somewhat prone to obscelescence but there is no excuse for leaving out PHP as a major contender in today's web applications server space. It has been around for a very long time (way before JSP) and it has recently gained tremendous popularity.Aside from this oversight, the book is an excellent executive summary for a reasonable percentage of the major technologies in this area."
3,Nice try but.......,As an electrician in a hospital I work in areas where a flashlight is a must. A headlamp is the obvious answer. The Trident ( and I also just purchased the Streamlight Argo) produce good light but battery life on both is miserable. The Argo is one large LED so their is no excuse for short battery life. The Trident has LED and incandescent with the incandescent obviously a bigger drain on the batteries. Three AAA batteries just aren't enough power!
2,This book was not to my taste. Other People might enjoy it.,"I found the plot of this book predictable and the character's felt fake. The format, which kept switching from script, to character, to real life, was extremely annoying and distracted from the story. Additionally, it wasn't really very thrilling or scary. I wouldn't bother reading this again."
1,TV OR NOT TV,"In ""Created By,"" Matheson spares no one his cycnicism and obvious disdain for the television industry. The idea of a t.v. show with gratuitous sex, nudity, and violence was something unusual when the book was written, but now in the new millennium, we're getting so much of it, we've become numb to it. Matheson's work is so out of sync with itself, vaunting different styles, making all the characters as unlikeable as possible and coming up with an ending that truly negates the entire premise. Psychobabble nonsense.Not Recommended"
4,Blind's What If,"Decent skate video, but the extras are what really make this one necessary. A gallery of Blind graphics from their heyday in the early 90's, and most importantly, Blind's landmark video ""Video Days"" hidden away in it's entirety in the board gallery.You can buy the box set with this dvd & Video days, but why buy 2 when it's already here?"
1,Printed at home,"My father in law is a avid reader, writer, and book maker. He makes books either via Apple or some other way. The point I am making is that his books are far superior to this version of Fear and Trembling. The entire book looks as if it was made on a printer at home and there are no copyrights or publisher info. Someone copy and pasted (I hope because now I am afraid to read what might be garbage) from the internet and slapped it in a book and printed it off. This is not what I paid for. If you are thinking about buying Fear and Trembling make sure that there is a publisher attached to it. This is the lesson I have learned from my mistake."
1,Want the Penguin Classics edition of this book,Amazon - can we please please please get the Penguin Classics / Alistair Hannay translation of this great book for Kindle rather than this particular edition which is unbelievably bad. The Penguin Classics edition is available in ePub - so can we please induce them to have a Kindle edition too?
1,DO NOT BUY THE AMAZON VERSION! GET PENGUIN CLASSICS INSTEAD!!,"This (the AMAZON edition, not the Penguin) is perhaps the worst translation I've ever seen in my life. I have asked Amazon for my money back. Unbelievably bad grammatical and syntactical errors make this version unreadable. It is as if someone just ran this book through Google Translate and printed and sold it. Absolutely terrible. I am going to look for the Penguin version of this book now. Do not purchase this version, waste of money. To repeat, purchase the Penguin Classics version of this book, not the Amazon LLC. version (the one with the image of Abraham, the angel, and Isaac on the cover is the bad version). I usually do not leave negative reviews but I must express how bad this was. Truly awful."
2,All The Words Are There... But A Poor Quality Book,"This book is acceptable in its words, but the edition is poorly published. I was looking for something to use for writing my Thesis. I am not sure I can (or should) quote this edition for my Thesis."
1,Random book shoved in the middle,"I received this book as Christmas present and while skimming through it I noticed that ""Pounds and Inches, a New Approach to Obesity"" was randomly in the middle of the book. Appropriately the publishers information is only printed in the random book section and not with the ""Fear and Trembling"" portion of the printing. The entirety of Fear and Trembling is there, just now with a weight loss book in the middle, I know I need to lose weight but come on...Oh the publisher is Popular Publishing, A Division of Artist Eye Books, a member of George Johnson, a media company. I can't find anything online about them."
2,a verbose excuser of wrong,"“..dexterity in doubting is not acquired in a few days or weeks,”- Kierkegaardone of the few, that I’ve found that would dofrom this verbose excuser of wrongalthough supposed to be bad, it rings a bit sadthough reflecting my thoughts and my songto me a low point, when society anointsthose who misstate and dodgewhere the truth is reduced, for a money ruseand the general reduction is lodgedso the idea of doubt, may the liars routthough that hope is dim and quite lowto hear the corrupt words, repeated and blurredjust turn on a TV news showmy comments at the time, when I gave up at about the 30% point"
1,DO NOT buy this edition of this book.,"The edition of ""Fear and Trembling"" that amazon is selling, from Pacific Publishing Studio, and printed as recently as Sept. 13, 2010, appears to be entirely illegitimate. There is no translator given credit for this edition, and no notes accompanying the text at all. As far as I can tell, it appears that the publisher has taken the Walter Lowries' translation, available on-line, and used it for this edition, without giving credit. The link here speaks to this assumption: [...]I am already wary of using amazon to purchase books, and this is likely the last straw for me. I feel awful having unwittingly purchased a book that is, at very best, not a typical scholarly edition of a scholastic text, poorly printed and annotated, and at worst unfairly filching other's hard work."
5,Klondike & Snow - A Love Story,"Have seen this program numerous times and can assure you that this will literally grab your heartstrings! It is truly a love story: the first being human to animal(s), then animals(s) reciprocating that love. You will laugh often and hard at the romping between Klondike and Snow. You will immediately fall in love with them; your heart will be captured. The laughter, however, may (and probably will) turn to tears as the bears mature and are ready to leave the ""nest""; you will be able to relate to the sad, empty feeling of the bears' keepers when the time comes to say good-bye. This is a love story not to be missed!"
4,Lives up to its promise,"This is a very useful addition to a property dominated with trees. For a relatively cheap price (versus a Stihl), you have a product that does what it promises - prume limbs up to 3 inches in diameter with no pressure needed. The extension pole is sturdy and and the unit solidly built. While I am quite satisfied with the unit, a few improvements would make it even better. A top grip for the second hand would be very useful - this would allow for a steady grip than grasping the pole. Second, a lock and unlock mechanism on the extension (rather than a screw) would make for changing length easier in the yard. Still, I recommend this product for someone who has to periodically lop small tree limbs from 10 to 15 feet off the ground."
2,"nice product; if you don,t use it much!","I ordered my first one in Jan. motor burnt apart by Feb. Now 2 months later,(with a replacement) the main bearing that drives the blade linkage, fell off the gear it was attached to and bent the blade drive shaft! I can't see these things lasting the 2 year warrenty!(unless you don't use it!)But ,it is a nice product, sure beats the push-pull type pruners, maybe I just got 2 bad ones!"
4,Good for homeowner use,"Charge it for 2 full days and it can cut about 18 branches. But like the manual says, it only cut branches up to 3"". So it's good for younger and regularly trimmed trees. I was able to trim all seven 6-year-old trees in 2 weekends and they were picked up by the sanitation dept. I'm happy with the product and saved $600 by doing it myself. It's easy to use and not as intimidating as a chainsaw."
2,bad quality american gardener yardsaw,"I like the design of this cordless pole saw by American Gardener (YardSaw 24-Volt Cordless) but its quality is bad. Although I used with care and followed the menu, It broke during my first use. The saw did not operate anymore."
2,I wanted Gayla Peeveya,I thought I was getting a rcording with original artists. This was pretty bad and went into the garbage the next day!
1,Felt like a family gathering,Listening to this was equal to listening to my family singing around the dinner table. Their good but not worth the money on a CD.
4,Great case ... could be larger.,"This is a nice case for my Sony Dvd handycam. The pockets can carry extra DVD's without their cases plus maybe 2 or 3 cases. It has a pocket that fits 2 extra batteries and I used some pockets for a few credit cards, money & a slim cell phone. I was able to fit a pack of tissues with the camera and I hooked my keys and hand sanitizer onto the case so I didn't have to carry a purse. It's listed as ""large"" but I can't fit the AC adapter in the bag which is not a big thing for me but may be for some. The case is somewhat hard so I feel the camera is well protected."
4,"Not ""large"", but a great bag","I'll agree with the first reviewer that the name of this product is misleading -- it is NOT ""large"". That being said, if it does fit your camcorder (I have a Panasonic PV-GS85) it's a great bag. It's well-padded and has numerous pockets to keep your cords, batteries, and DV cassettes organized. It's design is similar to a Mountainsmith pack, with several side loops and even a bungee on the top. It's great for traveling or whenever you need to maximize space. Overall, I'm very happy with mine."
3,Series is getting old,"This was a decent book in the series, but even this well-written entry can't save the series from itself. It's starting to get old, and it will take the endurance of a marathon runner for me to get to the end of the series, even though I liked nearly every entry and I enjoy the characters themselves.J.Ja"
3,I thought it would be better,Solo play is not that good little or no stroy line which is very uncommon for a C&C game. I played all the U.S. Solo levels on hard and it only took about 4 hours to play them all. Westwood did not set a new standard here. Think twice before spending the 50 bucks!
5,What Are You Talking About!!,"Command and Conquer games are the best games ever, the people that wrote bad rewiews don't Understand the game. You Do Click And Build and Attack BUT you have to use stratagey and know how to make a good base and playing online is another thing to do after beating the game or get tired of playing the computer,online the people have diffrent stratagey and you have to find it out and try to beat them.So Dont make the game look bad just because you dont like it or dont know how to play or understand."
4,Fabulous Game!,"Command and Conquer Generals is a good game. It has really good graphics, too (A HUGE jump from the old C&C games). Additionally, it has challenging missions. I would like more missions though. However, I miss the between game videos that were in Red Alert 2. The sound system has a faulty. It says things twice (there is an echo). It isn't fair that the GLA doesn't need power. Why do you need to have Generals Abilities? I feel that it is so unfair. Maybe a suggestion to EA Games would be to spend money on the abilities. I think China is the best."
3,EA ruined it!,"The 3D looks good, but you need a super computer to play this. Why not keep it simple? It's the gameplay that counts, not flashy buildings.The interface BLOWS! The little decorative designs around the interface should have been removed to reveal more vital screen. Unless you have a fast computer with a nice video card, you're stuck with low resolutions, leaving you with a narrow view of the battlefield.Also, it's incredibly buggy. And I miss the signature cheesy FMVs. Instead, we get slow realtime cinematics that can't be skipped.A final word. EA, BUG OUT! Westwood had a great franchise, now EA ruined it."
1,very disappointing,"I am a C&C; fan but was very disappointed by the latest release, C&C; Generals.A lot of problems are still there, you would imagine them being fixed by now. The AI is still just stupid & predictable, units dont respond when fired at, pathfinding sucks. There is no storyline. Missions are repetitive, too easy, too few in number and all of them boil down to 'blow up the enemy base'. The AI still cheats, it keeps building faster than you even without any income, it knows exactly where any of your buildings is located without ever entering your base or using a spydrone. Multiplayer is still plagued by the tankrush. It is too bad the navy has been eliminated.even though the graphics are superb and it is a lot of fun to nuke the enemy base it takes more than that to make a great game.Needles to say the game is not playable on the recommended system, you need something far more powerful.Buy it used, it is not worth the full price."
5,An Excellent Game,"They say that attention to detail makes the game. Well, this game is chock full of detail. Nukes leave radiation, ect. An awesome game, nice graphics, great multiplayer mode, and an engaging game overall. This is like a slightly better version of Age of Empires. More detail, upgrades aren't necessarily universal (each unit can be specialized to perform a specific task), units gain experience (something that AOE doesn't do, which is really annoying), and three very different ""civilizations"" each with it's own unique technologies and totally different focuses. I would highly recommend this game to any fan of RTS games."
3,Overrated,"A good RTS game but I actually thought Red Alert 2 was a lot more fun to play. The missions were better and the game had a cleaner look in Red Alert 2. The design for the 3D vehicles and the infantry looked like a hack job, like something you'd see in a Power Rangers movie. The cartoonish look of Red Alert 2 gave it charm but the cartoonish look and feel of Generals gives it an element of disappointment. For me the models ruined the whole game for me, the game play is actually quite good but everything looks too silly."
4,Good game with one flaw,"Generals is a pretty good game but there's one thing missing - the zero hour expansion pack. Without zero hour the game gets boring fairly quickly. Trust me, spend the extra and you'll get more story, more units, more strategic options, more skirmish maps and 100s of hours more fun"
1,Unhappy,"To tell you the truth, I'm flat out dissappointed. With all the hype I've been hearing about this game and how excited I was leading up the game coming out to buy it and play it is just unbelievable what I saw. The graphics are poor, maybe a little better than previous Command and Conquers. And you need so many requirements on your pc to make the game run the way it should. Overall I'm highly highly disspointed. And as a matter of fact I've already sold the game to a buddy of mine. So do yourself a favor and borrow it from a friend and check it out before you go and blow 40 bucks on a game thats worth about 10."
1,Con on a Classic,First I bought the game (it's command and conquer generals!).The only thing that it has is the build boxes and maps the same. My 100$ video card could not handle it so I went out and spent 400$ on the top of the line video card. I started playing it and there are no movie scenes with actors that people know and like. So I have to sit through a senerio boot up for 3-5min staring at my computer screen. Next time I'll wait until it's under priced and see it on my friends computer.
3,Not quite the same as the previous versions,"I didn't like Generals as much as Red Alert and Red Alert 2. For me, it's all about building different kinds of units and structures, but the selection is about half of that of the RA games. But the best graphics to date if you can afford the 1.5 GB of space it takes up."
1,"TOO MANY ISSUES, TOO LITTLE SUPPORT","I bought this game, it worked for a week. I began receiving fatal error messages. Attempted to contact customer support, no glory. Checked on EA's website, all they offer is a forum where techs post replies to problems. They told me that my chipset is not supported. The box does not list my chipset as not being supported. The game scanned my PC and said it met all system requirements. Don't waste your money."
5,greatest friggin' game ever!,"I love this game! My favorite army is the GLA. Even though they don't have much in the technology field, they still mange to be a formidable opponent."
2,"Poor concept, Poor execution","EA should never have tried to improve upon a series that's so different from there normal field of work. Insulting to the C&C series, this game has poor graphics, music, and none of the trademark realtime videos (who doesn't want to see Jessica Alba leaning over to the camera with a low-cut tank, to talk about battle strategy?) But my biggest conflict with this game is the whole GLA concept. I mean who wants to play a bunch of focking camel-jockies with their suicide crapola and false-sense of dignity?"
5,C.C. a great game for RTS gamers,"Awsome, it was a lot of fun. I play for hours sadly and forget the time. It is so much fun the time breezes by."
4,A twist on a good thing.,"C&C Generals when looked at as a whole is a good, solid, fun game. It is the first graphicaly pleasing C&C game, besides Renegade which really wasnt a RTS. It finally put new life into the C&C line that Tiberium Sun and Renegade didn't. The game play has a different feel, with in game cut scenes looking much like Warcraft III and Age of Mythology. Yet it still keeps its own style with some differences from the last C&C game. However, C&C Generals may have become a bigger title then it deserved from all the hype. Don't expect this to be a revolutionary type of game, it sticks to the basics that it has used for years, nothing extremely different or new. And to view it at its best you will need a good rig. Its a good RTS, like I said, solid, and if your a fan of the previous C&C games or if you like RTS styled games I would recomend it."
1,A big dissapointment,"Buying this game when it came out was a mistake i think to this day. C and C previous titles were ones to marvel at, this one is one to chuck in a garbage can. The missions are somewhat amusing and the terran is ok, but the subject of the game that really mad me, dare i say, cry, was the game's shortness and terrible unit graphics. In Generals, you play in 3 campaigns, terroist, chinesse, and AMERICAN, however, with only ten missions, +or-, you can get through the game, quite quickly. Also, being in 3D, i expected some quality of the game sprites, or on ground units, however, they dissapointed me greatly. With its extreme shortness, lack of modes, and basically, i came to conclude that this game, fell far short of reaching the shrine of C and C games"
2,Disapointment,"This games seems to be very racist for one which was a factor in my rating. Graphics are a major improvement. Game lacks a real plot, the plot is boring, no movies like previous versions. It can get kind of sluggish.The strategy has not improved much, still make the best weapons and more weapons to take over your enemy, no real new strategy improvement.Bottom line... not worth the money"
5,brilliant,"hbiudjcdmbdfjg ;m etjat;ljtiorjtc2 ,mhgnerjkgkjsvd jhbvarynjfkhrweuacve rfherthnjhzksjdpoAQEJIF JHSKFJHGR NBVJKSHRFWIQJ RFHC ICFH s uhfiudgyhejrhgiUHSRGJHDC xbshdhdhdhsfhsndcjhsdcsfn,cxhv,sfnen m,mdfhadsfkzjbfkav jfgyhkjrygh.rwkjgheuwhf jdghrluweiyhfi8hrufdywhv uty uytfuh hdgfgrfjdyrub4werkajbhckusyhdak7yuiarydsb bgb vb vxnxghxghxgxgsxyhshsgshxgbcxhshysgdhsdgyasegdygd hgdfdagy"
2,Not as good as previous C&C games,"Generals looks great, and is a decent game, but it falls far short of previous Command & Conquer titles.First off, while this game is VERY similar to the previous titles, many handy user controls have been omitted this time with no apparent advantage. Having played many RTS games, including every C&C; game to date, I was constantly frustrated trying to move my units around the map.Second, it's the buggiest C&C; to date. I have to reboot my machine after I play because DirectX can't be initialized by other games following a C&C; session.Third, this game is too similar to previous C&Cs.; The units are basically the same as they've always been with different names. The tank classes are very familliar, and after C&C; Tiberian Sun, the creativity in selection of the other units is pathetic.I've always looked forward to new C&C; games, but this one seems like it was rushed to market."
2,A disappointing addition to the command and conquer family,"Fun game for the first week, after that it is unbearable. Besides the infantry running at super slow speeds, China being the superpower, the huge number of glitches, and the selection of three armies you can play as the game is alright.The graphics are great, I mean why shouldnt they be? The game is the biggest system hog I've ever seen. You need a top of he line computer to run the game on the lowest detail. The campains are somewhat fun and the cinematics are pretty cheesy. The game really doesnt rely on your battlefeild tactics, it depends on how many forces you have and what type of forces they are. If your expecting insane battles and imersive levels your in for a big let down. Dont let the box fool you."
2,warcraft 3 with tanks,"this is what i've come to expect from EA, they dissolve great companies like westwood, take the title of an excellent series of games, then churn out the same boring eye candy everyone seems to like so much. instead of a fun, innovative game, EA decided to sell what appears to be a mod of warcraft 3 under the misleading title ""COMMAND & CONQUER."" don't waste your money or time."
3,The next Tiberian Sun,"C&C Generals is a semi-fun game, but unfortunatley it is riddled with bugs, many game lock-ups, and crash-to-desktop problems detract from the quality of the game. If you were a fan of the previous Command and Conquer games, then this game is NOT for you. Much of the Command and Conquer feel of the game has been ripped out. The plays more like the flop-title ""Real War."" The graphics are interesting, but are very cartoon-ish. The game has a lot of potential, and we may see more interesting titles develop via expansion, or a sequel, but at this point, the game does not deserve the Command & Conquer title."
2,what for a game :((,"Sorry, this was the worst game i played in the last time. In comparison with other titles Generals get the worst review of all. I am very disappointed about what they made out of this brand. The balancing is awful, America is every time the best choice. And people, what do say about great gfx? Are you blind? Just watch the water in the rivers. Just moving polygons. Not to mention about the missing story, strange mission goals and bad pathing. The best thing of the whole game are the remarks of the units. For this and the hope i got while playing that the game will be better by the missions i assign two stars.I was a big fan and played every title. Not more. Just installed the good old red alert. Wouldn't buy it with this experience."
3,Looks Spectacular But Doesn't Deliver,"The game looks and plays very well, but it offers nothing for a story, and only 7 missions per campaign? I was expecting the same quality that the earlier C&C games had. I just hope the expansion has more to it..."
4,Mininum requirements are high.,I have a Pentium III 1 Ghz with 512MB of RAM and an average ATI video card. GENERALS crashes regardless what I try to do - even on the lowest settings. I am NOT faulting EA Games - they obviously made a cutting edge game. This review should simply serve as a warning to those of you out there that are hard headed (like me) - that read the minimum requirements and think that a little more memory will make-up for an average video card. This is one of those games where size does matter. I am just trying to save some people the frustration of NOT being able to play this game.
1,What have they done?,"This game is terrible. I got the game in time as I had pre ordered it from amazon, but this game is actually horrible, the worst ive played in the command and conquer series. The camera angle is terrible and the units move so [darn] slow. They need to work way more harder if they want to see these games.I do not recommend this game to anyone at all"
1,Extremely Disappointing/Barely Playable,"EA Games has taken just about everything that made the previous C&C strategy games so appealing and completely destroyed it. Westwood never took the game so seriously, as EA has done, apparently trying to cash in on gamer's patriotism post 9-11 and recent goings-on in the Middle East. I found the final terrorist single player mission offensive as the objective being to destroy New York City. Yes, it's just a game, but where is the humor? Red Alert 2 featured ""B"" Grade acting in high quality video cut-scenes and the completely over-the-top plotline throughout was fantastic and a very enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, EA decided to go the ultra-realistic route, creating a very ""graphically intensive"" title (mind you, the only reason this game requires such a heavy graphics card is for the rediculous idea of rendering the entire game in 3D). This game is monotonous, tedious, and un-fun to the extreme. I'm going back to Yuri's Revenge."
2,Hardware,"This game does not work well with ATI Radeon cards. I have a 7200 64mg card along with more than enough to cover the specs and the game was choppy and slow. Come to find out its a programming bug, apparently the designers prefer nvidia.What I was able to experience was not overly exciting anyway, save your money people!"
1,"Looks great, if I could only play it!","This looks like a great game, but alas I cannot bare to play it. I've tried it on 3 top of the line machines (well over the recommended requirements), and the gameplay still comes out slow & choppy. I'd think twice about buying this obviously buggy game."
2,Mediocre at best,"I'm a big fan of the C&C; series but Generals isn't the same game at all.There is absolutely no storyline. Aside from a few scripted events here and there, you might as well be playing a Skirmish against the Artificial ""Intelligence.""The pathing is terrible. Worst I've seen since the original Age of Empires. Units have a terrible tendency to move in single-file lines or get stuck on each other, especially in the very cramped maps. They will also just sit there getting shot at if the enemy is out of thier range.Damage and rate of fire need to be adjusted across the board. If Iraq had mobile launchers that could fire Anthrax-loaded SCUDS every 5 seconds...On the other hand, the graphics and music are great."
1,"STAY AWAY, too many other good games out there to play","Incredible on how ""professionals"" have not only given this game a pass, but recommend it!!You have to be masochist, drugged induced, mentally ill or at the least in nostalgic denial about this C&C; game to say it doesn't suck. Need to emphasize the total lack of plot, super weapons, or at least the campy videos that at least made the red alert ones charming. Menu's as usual takes up too much screen space & I was frustrated because i got bogged down having to click build new units because of the 9 unit building limit (archaic mechanism). To have these fault in a Triple A 2003 game; it's ludicrous!! On top of all the negatives the freaking AI (crappy path finding & non too smart) blatantly cheats. I need to download the demo for C&C; 4 and hope for better days, thank GOD i borrowed this and DIDN'T actually spend any money on it."
3,Would get 5 if it wasn't so lacking,"Yes, it is Command and Conquer - among my favorite games of all time. Generals is even better than the previous C&C games. But why did I only give it three stars? Because it is too short! In C&C:RA there were a ton of missions to go on on each side. It took me a month of playing to finish the game as both sides. This time it took me 3 hours of playing to finish the USA missions. What's up with that?So, because the game is so short, it gets smacked down really hard."
2,ehh,"it was ok. I love stargety games. Starcraft has to be the best game ever made. But with this i was a little disapointed. For some reason it runs extremly slow on my amd 1.3. The graphics are good and the game is extremly realistic (something that ra2 was complelty missing). I feel that the graphis bog down the gameplay. I want graphics in something like splinter cell, not a stragety game. The units move painstaklenly slow. One thing that i found good was the unit abilities. The units are no longer attack or move, they have special abilities. Over all if your a hardcore stargety gamer that owns them all get this. If your not please buy a clasic like starcraft,warcraft or one of the RA games."
2,Not even close to living up to Red Alert series,The 3D gameplay they attempt here just doesn't work. It's not entertaining and addictive like the old RA 2. They should put effort into making a Red Alert 3.
3,Very Good RTS Action game,"C&C Generals has excellent graphics,and a good stroy line.You better have atleast a 64MB video graphics card (Geforce 4 Nivida) or better to play.I was disturbed by the use of Arabic people as the only race terrioist in the game.I which the maps were a bit bigger,so you donot run into the enemy so fast. Empire Earth by Sierra has huge and gigantic maps.Notwithstanding the above stated,the games is alot of fun."
4,"Game is great, reviewer needs a spelling lesson.","I am not sure how you could take anyone serious that uses chat lingo. Please, if you want to be understood make it so everyone who reads it."
1,Too many bugs,"After 4 patches, I still can't play online, even though all my other online games work (including Blizzard's and even Westwood's previous ones). The EA message board is flaming with similar (and other) problems. Avoid this one.More details re problem: I can connect to the EA server, download patches, and see games. I can even join games. But the games never start.It seems the game has trouble with NAT and firewalls, but it is worse than that, as I can't connect even if I try a direct connection through my cable modem, or even if I use my dial-up modem!"
4,"Great Game, But Low-End PC Owners Beware","This game is a worthy addition to the command and conquer family. The main highlight is the fact that you can actually play as real life nations. Instead of the GDI and the NOD terrorists, you play as the US, China, and the Global Liberation Army (the terrorists). There are lots of new units and structures, and the graphics are better then any C+C game to date. The only problem with this game is that in my opinion you need an awesome PC to run it to its full potential. I have an AMD 2700+, 512MB PC-3500 RAM, and an ATI 9700 Pro graphics card, and the scrolling still tends to get choppy once your base gets significantly large. Overall, this game's concepts are great, and is worth getting if you have a P4 2.2Ghz or AMD 2600+ or better."
3,"Good Game, but need supercomputer to run it!!!","I like the 3d effects, but why do they have to up the requirements SO high. I mean my computer can run AOM, why can't it run this better. It's like they want to force you to buy a new Video card or something!"
5,C&C series is a must have for Real time strategy game players,"I have been playing C&C since the first one came out in 1995 and had never got tired of playing this game. The only thing that can make me leave a C&C Game is a New C&C game. What makes great this games is not the graphics or movies, what makes it great is the always fun gameplay."
4,Addicting War Game,"Command & Conquer: Generals, excels beyond its predecessor Command & Conquer releases. Generals gives you the opportunity to choose between 3 sides: United States, China, and the Global Liberation Army. Each has their own distinct units, and way of fighting (of course)...and in addition, as each unit racks up kills, they receive promotions. The higher they rank, the better features and skills they posess.One downside to this version is the view. It goes for a ground-level approach, rising and lowering with the altitude, and slightly zooming in/out as you scroll toward your units or opposing units. This interferes with the gameplay slightly, but you soon get used to it.Overall: a thrilling addition to the Command & Conquer family, with mind-blowing graphics and sounds."
5,wow,"this is a great game, you do need a very fast computer though, it is worth it. in the game if you like using lots of hi teck aircraft stuff, be the USA. if you like fire and lots of powerful units and nucular wepons be China. If you like stelth power ups and being evil be the GLA.skermishing is very cool. don't pay attention to other people it is very cool"
4,great for light duty use,"I purchased this light in May 2005 and has worked very well (on my 3rd set of batteries in 7 years).I've never had any issues under light duty use. I don't drop my flashlights, or bang them around and abuse them. The case feels solid and indestructible, but the LED assembly looks cheap. I wouldn't be throwing this light around and then expect to rely on it.This was my first ""good"" flashlight... I've since moved onto Surefire lights, but this old Streamlight still works and has served me well."
3,Streamlight 33202 LED 3C NOT Waterproof,"Everything said about this flashlight is spot on except for the fact that after using underwater in less than 10 feet, the battery compartment leaked and the batteries turned to rusted mush. So much for the claims of being waterproof!!! Otherwise a really nice flashlight but not the rugged competitor it claims to be...So far have not heard from the manufacturer about servicing the warranty...will let you know"
2,Don't Drop This Flashlight,"Contrary to what a previous reviewer said about being able to throw it against a wall without breaking it, this flashlight did not survive a 2 foot fall from my young childs hand onto the street this Halloween evening.It is broken and no longer working. I had it a week. Update 11/14/03-after several emails back and forth, the company did send a free replacement LED bulb unit. The flashlight works again. Only thing now is that they sent blue LED lights instead of the white ones I had originall purchased. I've raised the ranking one more star for their response, albeit flawed.Be careful it is fragile despite it's looks. Don't be fooled by claims by other reviewers who have not put it through a simple test by a child dropping it."
1,Poor performer underwater/ NOT shock resistant,"I bought one of these lights to work underwater and the seals failed filling the battery compartment with water. Streamlight replaced it, but when dropped from 4 feet to a carpeted floor it failed..replacement LED is 37.95 with shipping and replacement Streamlight 3C LED can be had for $39.00 so...I am tossing the Streamlight 3C LED in trash can and taking the loss...Sorry, but this item is not reliable, durable, or dependable..such a surprise for a company with such a good rep"
2,Not Impressed,I purchased both the Streamlight ProPolymer 3C and 4AA flashlights. The 4AA is rated at 27 lumens and the 4C is rated at 40 lumens. I have tried different sets of batteries in both flashlights but the 3C never puts out more light than the 4AA. The 4AA is smaller and fits better in the hand and since it is just as bright and costs much less I can not recommend the 3C but am happy with the 4AA. One curious note about the 4AA: it seems to put out the most light using rechargable batteries which are a lower voltage than the regular alkaline batteries.
3,"OK, but...","This LED flashlight is just OK. It's not as bright as I expected, nor as bright as a compact LED flashlight with a SINGLE 1W LED."
2,"Vogelzang TK-02 Tea Kettle, 3-Quart for woodburning stove .",Disappointed. It started to rust with first use. We are looking for one that won't rust.Everytime you fill the kettle there is always rust in it
2,Rusted almost immediately,"I don't know if it is possible to find cast iron that doesn't rust, but this rusted the first time I used it. It's fine and functional for sitting on top of my wood stove, but the quality seems pretty poor."
3,vogelzang TK_)@Tea Kettle 3 Quart,"The tea kettle is sturdy and I seasoned it as soon as I got it. I used cooking oil on the surface and put it in my oven. I was rather disappointed to see that after a couple uses with water, it started to tarnish."
2,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed with this tea kettle. First of all, it did not come with a lid despite that the box it arrived in showed the tea kettle with a lid. When I called the company, the customer service agent claimed that even though the packaging box showed a lid that it did not come with one. Then she claimed that if I sent it back, that there would be a 30% reshelving fee! So I decided to keep it, but when we filled it with water and put it on top of our wood burning stove, the inside rusted within hours! Very, very disappointed!!!"
3,C-,It will get the job done but it seems to rust easily. The bottom seems as if it make poor contact with the stove.
3,Rustic Humidifier,"This is great as a decorative peace, however not so good as a functional tea pot or humidifier. We use ours on our fire place insert as a humidifier when the fire place is going. It rusted out rather quickly even before I refilled it a sencond time. Buy with caution! I will be replacing mine with a copper or stainless still tea kettle soon."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this steamer because it seemed to be the best price/capacity ratio in the category. However, 3 QT volume is not true. The kettle is much smaller and doesn't hold 3QTs even when filled to the brim. Moreover, when full it actually leaks the water from under the lid when the water starts boiling. Thus, to be usable you have to fill it with no more than 2 QTs. It is a shame because I specifically needed a larger capacity steamer to avoid filling it up many times during the day (I keep my woodstove running most of the time). This is also not an error in the on-line product description, but the misrepresentation directly from manufacturer (it says 3 Qts on the box). Otherwise, the kettle is pretty basic and has greyish/greenish hue (another minor disappointment - my wood stove appears comparatively darker). I, guess, after all twenty-something bucks just doesn't buy enough iron to make a true 3 Qt kettle..."
5,steamer for the wood stove,works perfect for us. used for putting moisture back into the air during these dry winter months. we will see how long it last
2,Just ok,This kettle does its job but it rusts like crazy. I seasoned it and still after a couple of day rust. I dont use it for drinking water just to humidify the air but it just does not look all that nice with the rust. Also in the picture the kettle looks green but its really black.
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR YOUR BLUES AT THE SAME DECIBEL LEVEL AS A DOG THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU!""","If you're one of ""Shaq's, The King Of The World Blues Reviewer's"" loyal fans, you'll know that I love Otis, and he is one of my six all-time favorite electric blues guitarist's. My prior reviews of his CD's, all have exemplary reviews. But this CD, fails two of Shaq's critical tests. First, the volume and clarity of this CD is terrible. I had to turn up the sound on my stereo louder than on any prior reviewed CD. Second, there are a total of 10 songs on this CD, and the total running time of the entire CD is 40 minutes. So as Shaq always says: ""You can't get da blues in 3-4 minutes. Summary: If you're the type of person who likes to turn your portable CD player up to it's highest volume, and sneak up behind someone you're stalking, and not have them know you're behind them, this is the CD for you! Playing this CD at its highest level won't bother the librarian, or your neighbors."
5,Blues guitar to ease your mind,"Otis Rush is a marvellous blues guitarist and singer, and this may be his best album. It is certainly one of my most played album through the years. All songs here are classics. Otis Rush's great vocals and lyrics soars through the record, with beautiful, tormenting guitar licks by the man. The band is also very good, led by Nick Gravenites, and with fine horn arrangements. This is some of the most authentic soul blues you will ever hear. My top songs are 'Right Place, Wrong time' and 'Take a look behind'. This one should be on your stereo."
4,"If you're a fan, It's great Gary Stewart.","Ramona, Brand New Whiskey and Rainin', Rainin', Rainin' are worth the the price of the CD alone. They're pure Gary and will bring back the feeling of his early work."
2,Stick with Gary Stewart's RCA Victor Recordings!,"On this album, Gary Stewart's voice sounds like he's been playing to many smoke-filled clubs and dancehalls. The songs are well-written and feature good back-up work, but Stewart's voice sounds damaged.This Hightone Records collection of new Stewart recordings doesn't hold a candle to his RCA Victor recordings. I've listened to this album two or three times since I purchased it--hoping that I've misjudged the album and will find a redeeming track. Regretably, I've been disappointed every time. Stick with Gary Stewart's RCA Victor recordings."
3,Okay,More of a story of a lot of trips. Not much insight.This dude had one trip in life The good old days
5,Like a Breath of Fresh Air!,"This book changed my life. It may not be ""scholarly"" as one reviewer pointed out, but for me, the average Christian woman who is so glad to fall into bed in one piece at night, I don't want dry Biblical exposition! Give me stories! Give me laughter, give me tears. Give me thought-provoking messages to ponder. Give me grace. If you are in need of grace without having to wade through commentaries and ""scholarly"" books that must be accompanied by eight feet tall glasses of water, Liz is your lady! And if her lessons at the end are from her own heart, then be glad, for her heart is as compassionate, understanding and accepting as your down comforter. Highly, highly recommended. Lisa Samson, author of The Church Ladies."
5,Inspired!,"BAD GIRLS OF THE BIBLE is an inspired book that is sure to bless countless women for many years to come. Liz Curtis Higg's unique use of fiction combined with Scripture and modern application helped me see myself, my past and my future in a whole new light. Thank you, Liz, for pouring your heart and soul into this amazing book. -- Robin Lee Hatcher, author of THE FORGIVING HOUR and WHISPERS FROM YESTERDAY"
5,Great reading and a very good book for Book and Bible Club.,The title sounded very interesting. We are to the last chapter. Soo much to talk about.It takes you into the Bible.
4,A most interesting read,"The first pages of this book got my attention and held it. A refreshing, thought provoking book for anyone with an interest in the Bible. I recommend this book for any Bible study group."
5,Love this book!,I am really enjoying using this with the study guide. I would definitely recommend this bible study to other women.
3,great theory.... but...,"I really was excited to order this book. I thought that it would be a good book about naughty girls or a naughty book about good girls. Either way, I wanted a book that was hip and current, and while it may very well be, the sad fact is that I just couldn't read it. The stories didn't pull me in, I couldn't find the correlation to the bible stories and it was just too vague. the book is gathering dust on my shelf and I am saddened that I just couldn't find this book interesting."
1,"bad girls of the bible was ""bad""","I was not able to read the book as I found the author did way to much editorializing, assuming, surmising etc.The Bible leaves much unsaid and this author was more than eager to fill in the blanks. Made for difficult reading, I couldn't get through to the story itself and make any of my own decisions without being over run with hers. Besides no one is ""bad"" most of us just haven't learned yet! Can't wait to see what others in the book group think!"
4,Bad Girls of the Bible and what we can learn from them,"Excellent to help you get your life in prospective with some very famous ""Bad Girls"". There were some areas that really were kind of dragging (the first chapter) but over all a modern day look at historic matters."
5,A Great Book and Bible Study!,"What a special book this is. Friends and I decided to meet together and discuss the chapters of this book as a ""light"" study for the summer. Although lighter and sometimes humorous, we all gained much from this book, many things we had not known or even thought of before. It is very worth your time. I can't wait for the next one to come out, which I understand is very soon. Thank you Liz!"
4,A Different Look at Women in the Bible,I've only just acquired this book which I heard mentioned at a Cursillo meeting recently so am just beginning to read it. I think it would be good for a women's group for a study book. The stories bring daily events in our lives into parallels with these women of the Bible.
4,"An amazing, one of a kind book!","Although not a perfect book, this was one of the best Bible-based books I've read! Bad Girls of the Bible takes a look at ten amazing women who inspire me and encourage. At the beginning of each chapter Liz starts with a short story of each woman if she were in present-day, making it easier to relate with each woman... Liz also separates each verse in the story and shows what may really be inside each woman's heart. I couldn't put this book down! It reminded me of what small things can make us sin.. and what can bring us back to God. Entertaining, amazing, inspiring book! I encourage it for all readers!"
4,Great for Women's Bible Study,Great study with great discussion opportunities with other women from diverse backgrounds!
2,Bad Girls...Good Lessons,"Everyone loves a bad girl, right? But surely they are not the ideal teachers we want to influence our lives. In ""Bad Girls of the Bible and What We Can Learn From Them,"" author Liz Curtis Higgs, attempts to persuade us otherwise.This book takes you through several fiction stories based on the ""bad girls"" of the Bible, such as Eve and Delilah. The stories bring a modern twist to a classic Bible story and truly bring the character to life, maybe making the read think ""Hmmm...this could be me."" Higgs follows the fiction story with verse-by-verse commentary of the Bible story to put the ""bad girls"" actions into perspective and make the reader realize that all girls, no matter what our actions portray us to be, needs the love of a Savior.*Although, I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review, the content displayed is of my own thoughts."
3,Book,"Book was in good shape with no signs of wear. It's just OK content-wise. I totally love the concept--each chapter has a different ""bad girl"" of the bible! Great for bible studies, as it has thoughtful questions at the end of each chapter."
5,A must read!,"Liz Curtis Higgs is a delightful speaker. I would know because she encouraged me through a wonderful lesson while speaking at my weekly college convocation. I know that God provides the words for her to use to encourage His children. This book shares stories from women of the Bible who needed God's grace; just like we do now! And the amazing thing is that He offers grace through His Son, Jesus Christ, for all of us. You will see yourself in one of these women and perhaps more. I know I did. No matter how bad we were or are; Jesus loves us and died for our sins. Reach out to Him and He will give you His saving grace. Enjoy reading and may you gain more than you ever thought possible."
3,Great concept--could be improved by better writing,"I actually liked this book better than I liked Slightly Bad Girls...I feel as if the Biblical characters were easier to identify with than the ones in SBD. Unfortunately, I still do not enjoy Ms. Higgs writing style--I feel as if she over simplifies too many things and the whole ""girlfriend talk"" just isn't my cup of tea anyway. That said, I would recommend this book to someone looking for a light devotional read."
5,Bad Girls of the Bible,"My Sunday School Class is using it as their Bible Study, and think it is well done. Better so far for younger women, but I have read ahead and it will get better for the older woman."
4,Bad girls of the bible,"I enjoyed this book very much, Liz Curtiss Higgs gave an interesting perspective on each girl that made me see them in a different way. I also am looking at things in my life differently from what I have read. I enjoyed the humor along with the real. I would highly recommend this book. and plan to read more of her books in the future."
2,Just not for me,"This book arrived about 2 weeks ago, and i really did think i could read it. Having been a bad girl who is now saved by grace, and having learned many things the hard way, i thought that i could learn a few lessons from those who have gone before me. Well, i tried to read it, but honestly, this book is not for me.Just recently i shared with a friend why my family won't be attending the really big Easter production in our city...i am very careful about the graphic images that we take in. And the written images in this book are ones that i simply don't need. This may be a useful tool for others, but not for me. While the Bible certainly does mention scandalous behaviors and women, most of the Bible isn't written in an alluringly graphic way.So, this is my honest non review, of a book that was sent to me by the publisher. There are many other much more thorough reviews of this book, if you are interested, you can read some of them here."
2,BAD GIRLS BAD READ,"I read Bad Girls of the Bible. I had high hopes for this book and was very anxious to read it. It started out as a slow read for me, which made it hard for me to stay engaged in the reading. I assumed it would parallel women of the bible with the women of today; the qualities and characteristics we share today with the women then. I assumed it would pull lessons from back then and bring them into today's real world of women. I assumed the lessons would teach us about faith, commitment, and love. I assumed this book would teach me to fight the good fight of faith, to overcome any obstacles in life by continuing in my faith walk, to believe God no matter what happens, and to develop more effectively in the fruit of the spirit. I assumed a lot about this book. I was highly disappointed! It took me over 2 months to read this book because I kept losing interest. I don't consider myself a bad girl, but this was indeed a bad read!"
2,Bad Girls Bible,"Found it to be tedious and dull. A bit run on. The short stories were in themselves decent. The ""lessons"" however run on and tedious. Authors attempt at being glib and insightful missed the mark. Needed to be more precise instead of trying to be clever."
1,Bad Girls of the Bible,"Our Sunday School used this book for a quarter, and I could hardly wait until we were done. Liz's humor got to me -- one woman in our class said it is hard to read some of the rough, crude things. I love humor, BUT.............her writing turns me off completely. They had the video to go with the book yesterday and she is just too silly for a mature Christian!"
1,awful--not worth any stars,"this book is misleading in its title and anti-woman. I purchased it for use at a women's church retreat I was leading. Upon opening it I was dismayed to find it was chock full of fundamentalist mysogenist dogma meant to show how women need to remain in their ""place"" by exemplifying the ""sinful behavior"" of these women. I promptly returned the book. Buyer beware before purchasing these books."
5,Great Book,"This book is useful in giving you the author's in-depth perspective on some women of the Bible. She has done her research in numerous commentaries, which gave me assurance that her information is valid. It came in a timely manner and in mint condition! Her writing is very much like dialogue, which took me some getting used to, but it's been entertaining."
