1,Disappointed,"I purchased this product believing that I would receive a working DVD, CD. I was deeply disappointed with this transaction.Susie Wang"
4,works like advertised,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant. However, I've gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my Senseo.The coffee is very good, but it has fallen a little short of my expectations. I've previously brought Kona back from my Hawaiian vacations and ground it myself. The pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground.UPDATE: for my next shipment, this two-cup style was backordered. Aloha Island Coffee Co. sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single-cup style pods instead. I've found these pods to work better, fit the Senseo machine better, and this coffee now does tasted just as good (or better) than fresh ground whole bean Kona!I think the single-pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two-cup style, but the difference is definitely noticeable!"
1,Senseo machine jammed,"Echoing other reviews, performance is not consistant. One time we did get excellent coffee, this morning it jammed the Senseo machine with a steam lock and there is not telling when we will be able to re-open it. Considering the price of these pods, even only one bad pod makes it impossible to recommend the product."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I was thrilled to find Kona coffee in pods for my Senseo machine. However, these pods do not really fit right. Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup. There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be. I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed. In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee. I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive."
3,Buy this just to see...,"... Dixie Evan's riotous ""Casting Couch"" , Patti Waggin'sathletic ""Parisian Pickup"", and the over-the-hill Jean Carter sing the blues classic ""Hot Nuts"" & then do a lumbering striptease. Some fun stuff here, but not all the vignettes are top-notch. You get some Tempest Storm & Lili St. Cyr, but would have loved to seen Jennie Lee's and Alouette LeBlanc's tassel-tossing. Most of the music has that blaring,wah-wah bump n' grind beat -- Something Weird should put out a CD of some of these tunes."
2,"Good book, not enough Linux specific information.","This is a great book for general computer information, as are all his books. Its low score is based on the linux content, this book is just a quick re-write of the ordinary book, for Linux users, especially new Linux users, it fails to provide enough info. It needs to discuss compatible hardware more and Linux specific setup set out in easy to follow points.A disapointing effort."
3,"NOT A CLASSIC, BUT GREAT NOSTALGIA","for me, it's about GET IT ON (remix or reg), COME, the title cut, and PASS THE PUSSY. this is by faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar not a classic, but it is good for great nostalgia. also, man, it's chubb rock as well, man!!!!"
3,California's special style,"Informative, needed less description and more diversity of photos. It shows Malibu and north to Hearst Castle but not much of the architectural detail in many of the Los Angeles, Los Feliz, Hancock Park or Santa Monica homes."
1,Just about as bad as I thought it would be,"Well, what was I expecting? Pretty horrible movie. Jenny McCarthy is hot of course, but she is so ""not hot"" in a lot of the situations she puts herself in. Carmen Electra is incredibly annoying. I understand it's a comedy that relies on gross-out factor, but most of the situations are so overdone that it just makes you uncomfortable watching them."
1,ONE OF THE WORST EVER,"Ten seconds into this movie I could tell it was going to be really, really bad. I do like Jenny McCarthy; I think she is a very good slapstick actress (read: Lucille Ball). Why does toilet humor have to dominate the scripts these days? The dumbing down of America? Probably so. The actress who played her roomate was sort of good in that Jayne Mansfield/Carol Wayne kind of character. Carmen Electra --- stick to posing in nudie magazines and helping to open new supermarkets. This movie is one of the worst ever. Not as awful as ""Soul Plane,"" but close."
1,SUCKS! One of the WORST I've ever seen.,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I shut it off early.Bad acting, stupid plot, boring, trash, etc. Too much whining and shrieking.All of the female characters were STUPID and annoying! Grow up!"
1,"It's not a dirty shame, it's just lame!!!","I am sorry, I wouldn't give this movie one star. It's so horrible that it is funny. Did this movie make any money???"
1,Didn't know what to exepct.,"Miss McCarthy should have stuck with modelling for Hugh Hefner, because every movie I've seen her in has been pretty much a disaster.Placating to the teen-girl to 20-something female raunch dem, McCarthy's offering is truly beyond description. Foul, bad taste, a poorly written script with no real plot nor story, this film goes from one aimless vignette to another.It reminds me of some of the brainless teen trash made in the 80s. It's that bad.I imagine blue collar teen to twenty-something girls will like it, but, well, that says a lot about how that demographic's been bastardized by this junk.Avoid."
4,Don't fall for the hate,"Some of the other reviews are a bit harsh. This movie is not bad at all. Sure it's no Oscar winner, but it's a fun time. Jenny is very good at doing what she does best. She is a great physical comedienne. And to see her name in the writing credits should make you think twice before writing her off. Seriously what has anyone else written out there? The movie is wacky, but it's supposed to be. Just sit back, lower those freaking expectations and enjoy it a little."
2,Gorgeous gals.,Beautiful women with a 2 star story. The romance was helped by fantasy to the right ending. Worth the price.
2,"Not a good movie overall, but a few funny bits.","Hot chicks make the movie bearable. The story is horrible as is the acting. There are some funny bits throughout the movie. I wouldn't pay to watch this, but for free and at 3am it was OK."
2,something exaggerated,This movies is ok. But just that! It is a comedy through exaggerated. The end is pretty much predictable. Good actor though...
4,Funny Movie,"This movie was meant to be funny in a ridicules way. You see that in the first scene. I thought it was great. I think people that didn't like it just think women are supposed to be sexy all the time and can't make fun of their bodies or be human. This is VERY tame in comparison to what we apparently like to see coming out of unattractive male actors' mouths (if I may just add). I fell asleep in the movies watching the Hangover, because it was so incredibly dumb, complete with overacting and recycled humor, but this is what we apparently want to see. I think Jenny McCarthy is hilarious and this movie shows she's moved on from being a Playboy pin up and wants to show other pretty girls they can not only be beautiful but silly at the same time. Good Job for making a cool movie that shows girls they don't have to live in this unrealistic box men try to stuff them in. I love her craziness."
1,Dirty Shame,"I'll admit that I ended up renting ""Dirty Love"" out of desperation. I like Jenny McCarthy, but something about the movie seemed like it might be trying too hard. And as it turns out, that's exactly why I'm not recommending this movie.McCarthy stars as Rebecca, a woman who was recently cheated on by her supermodel boyfriend. She proceeds to have a very public but not very funny nervous breakdown. She enlists the aid of some friends, headed up by Carmen Electra in a borderline offensive role, and Eddie Kaye Thomas of American Pie fame, who is very good in spite of his surroundings. He pines for Rebecca, but she only sees him as a friend. How original.The fact that the plot is very thin would be forgivable if there were some good laughs. I couldn't even muster a chuckle. McCarthy is beautiful and talented, but this movie just doesn't work. Final Grade: D-"
4,Dirty love,"alright movie for a straight to DVD film I assume that's what it was as I never heard of it before, If you are a Jenny McCarthy fan as am I, You will enjoy this movie , lots of nudity she is always funnier than I expect from her and is a more talented actress than she ever got credit for."
3,Not a Comedy Person BUT! This was funny (not hilarious but funny),Not hilarious but funny. A little depressing just because it does kind of encapsulate the current stage of things right now but! it's nice to laugh at such wackiness sometimes I guess. haha
3,get drunk and watch it,"this is another so bad it's good type. really not the best movie, some scenes will make you want to hurl, but if you don't take it, or yourself, too seriously, it's definately worth getting drunk and watching it with friends. get gigli, too, and make it a horrible double feature!"
4,OMG it is too funny!!!!,"I was hesitant about this movie, but man it was too funny, I was laughing so hard I was crying! I found it completely worth it! Way to go Jenny M.!"
5,I love this movie!!,It is a little raunchy but it is really funny movie. A lot of down time between funny scenes in movie but the funny parts make it worth it. Not for children.
5,Who doesn't love Jenny?,If you're a Jenny fan you will love this movie. I almost loved Carmen's character as much as Jenny's. Together they are a hoot. Beware tho- it's Carmen like you've never seen her before- LOVE IT!
1,Not funny,"Not funny at all. She ""over acts"" the whole movie while crying, screaming, and whyning... if you're hoping to see a sexy Jenny, forget it. Instead, we are subjected to her bodily functions, one after another (I won't go into details)."
1,I lasted less than 7 minutes :(,OMG! How could anyone release this thing? Not one humorous line in nearly 7 minutes?!?! It became literally painful to watch.
1,No stars!!!,Crude rude & unbelievable that ANYone would find this entertaining didn't watch more than 10 minutes. UGH. Don't waste your time.
1,Do not waste your time,"I wanted it to be funny. I was crap. Not a lot good things to say, glad it was free. I stopped watching when she had her period at the supermarket and ran all over the store leaving a trail."
3,Decent.....Jenny's HOTNESS only makes up for some of poor writing,Jenny is both funny & EXTREMELY Hot ( and Topless at one point) in this flick but not what I would say is a great movie by any stretch when it comes to comedic writing.
4,Dirty Love,"This Romantic Comedy, I couldn't find anywhere I looked. Not a video store, or even a store that's suppose to have everything, and this video was to be a Christmas present for one of my daughters. Finally, I was able to find it, on Amazon, and purchased it with days to spare, before the holiday time together with them. We ended up watching the video and spent the most precious time together. We had a blast and the movie was a big hit too.Clif DeuvallJust making my children happy with the help of Amazon"
1,Most stupid movie I have ever seen,Please don't waste your time...It starts bad and gets even worse.I took 30minutes and stopped at the scene where a fish stuck in a mans a..So please - shouldn't be there a minimum on intelligence and ethics???
1,OMG!!!!!,This is officially the WORST movie I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life!!!!!! Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeez words cannot begin to describe!!!!! wow! what an experience. I feel almost brain dead now!!!!
1,gave up after ten minutes,"horrible acting, couldn't watch more than a few minutes, nothing more to say. thank god this was prime and I didn't pay for it."
5,Jenny McCarthy-A guy's perspective.Guess what! It ain't magic.(It's Good Clean fun).,"This is how I want to see Jenny McCarthy. Yes, I know autism is a serious condition. But when I see and hear Jenny McCarthy I want to laugh, there's too much tragedy in the world, and as a guy, when I see Jenny McCarthy, I want to laugh ""hard"". This movie is hillarious, I think a lot of people underestimate ""straight to video"" or ""cable"". My favorite is when she's slapping the magician. I won't reveal too much I will say this though ""Magic Spellllllllllll!"""
1,Review of Amazon Prime Videos,"This is actually a review of Amazon Prime Video service, not necessarily this particular movie. I've found amazon prime video selection to be embarrassingly bad. Logan's Run? Really? When I clicked on 'most popular' Dirty Love came up. Seriously? Most popular? Ouch. It seemed to me that when I first signed up for amazon prime they had some decent movies licensed. Now the selection is laughable. You might as well go to the library and check out some VHS tapes. Whatever they're charging for amazon prime now, it's not worth it."
1,Terrible.,"This movie was...terrible.I can usually tolerate some pretty stupid stuff, but Jenny and Carmen's acting in this movie was atrocious. And it wasn't funny. At least Eddie is a sweetheart."
1,Why on earth would someone pay to produce this mess?,This was a terrible movie. Everyday life is funnier. This is like an overdramatic child with a vulgar set of ideas went loose through the most terrible ideas for a movie you could possibly think of. I couldn't bring myself to finish the movie. It was that bad. I am embarrassed for Jenny McCarthy and for all women. Disgrace and wtf and a million other unpleasant disgusted emotions. Don't bother.
1,terrible,Why did I waste my time watching this movie? It was on the first page of popular picks. It was beyond bad.
1,Irritating,"I really wanted to give this a try, based on the average rating, but I could not tolerate more than 15 minutes due to the high annoyance factor."
2,Sub-moronic,Another ninety minutes blown away through ill-advised curiosity.2005 was a wonderful year for 35mm FujiFilm.What kind of cam rig could you put together for $3500?Possibly one good enough for Asher to use on his next project.
2,makes me feel dumber than a blonde,"wow, this movie had jenny go through unfortunate circumstance after another, but none of them were funny! the plot was terrible.. everytning was. overall, this movie sucked!"
3,An original movie -- thank goodness,"""Dirty Love"" is an old-fashioned love story told with a new-fashioned edge. And it's original. The same critics who howled over ""Dirty Love"" gave three stars to tired, old remakes like ""Yours, Mine And Ours"" and ""Cheaper By The Dozen."" Snore. I suggest you give Jenny's film a try. You may be happily surprised. Or it may not be your cup of cocoa. Either way, you'll come away admitting you've never seen a movie like it before. Hollywood needs more films that can say that."
5,I actually do love this movie!,"For all its cliched flaws, I really loved this movie. It was gross-out female humor and more entertaining to me than Bridesmaids, which ran boring to me. I especially love the supermarket scene. My girlfriends and I have watched this on multiple occasions and refer to it constantly. Thank you for producing a film that is funny AND something beyond mamby-pamby chick flicks!"
3,Hilarious....but drags on a bit long.,"Actually very funny. Jenny does everything over the top in this one. The movie flows pretty nicely until near the end, and we get the usual sappy happy ending, then it begins to drag on."
3,"very, very funny , a must get for your collection!!","I recently saw this film and laughed my tail off. some very odd scenes but hysterical. McCarthy is actually a pretty cool , funny , and interesting chick after seeing her on some talk shows and interviews. I dont rememember trailers or this movie coming out in the theatre, but from beginning to end we laughed , and if you saw (little man) you know what im pointing out , what a joke----should have just recorded the trailers on tivo and save myself two hours."
3,Laugh out Loud,A quirky funny movie. The jokes were pretty funny. I think the grocery store scene was especially funny but thought it went too far to keep the joke going. overall had a good time watching.
5,I'm Still Laughing!,"I just finished watching this movie and I'm still laughing! It was hilarious! I don't understand the bad reviews, movie critics need to lighten up a little bit and have some fun.I think Jenny is great. It's rare these days to find a gorgeous gal who isn't afraid to laugh at herself and be completely crazy. 5 Stars!"
1,Horible & missleading,I ordered this movie and when i got it i went to watch it and it is in black and white half the time...then there are promotional sayings thru the whole thing alaso some of the sound didnt work on it. So basicly this seller wasted my money.....Thanks alot.
5,Best Adult Anti-Chick Flick!,"Hilarious movie! If you like raunchy humor this movie is for you. The thing that makes the movie interesting is that the humor is from a women's perspective. Although, I think some women may find it offensive to see women in unflattering roles. I think the unflattery is what makes this movie fun, different, and progressive. If anything, Dirty Love is unapologetic crude humor that situates female comedy as an equal to the crude humor found in male dominated adult comedy."
4,What in the world is Auction without this book ?,Great book ! Learn about different auctions models. Spark new ideas and still think that Ebay is not the end of it but it's just the beginning.You wouldn't know what you miss if you skip this book.
3,ordered wrong mop,It looked like my Mr Clean mop refills but when arrived it was not. They had no metal holes on top to clip into my mop. In fact it was a smooth bar on top and I have no idea what kind of mop handle is suppose to attach to these refill mops. I dont like mopping nor do I like the mopping industry. Every 3 months there seems to be a new mop at the store with new refills and my old refills are just no longer available.
3,No hole for screw in piece,"This roller mop refill does not have a hole in the center of the bar for the mop to screw in to. If your mop has a screw-in piece to attach to the mop head, it won't work in this refill."
5,LOVE these pans!,"I really love these pans! I received mine for a wedding gift 14 years ago and unfortunately, just tossed the last one. They're not made to last forever, but they cook so very well, very evenly, and I even have the high-end ""chef"" named pans and they don't even compare to these! The only hint I can pass on regarding these pans is don't ever put them in the dishwasher. Even though they say you can, it only makes the teflon come off sooner and you'll have to toss them like I did. I about cried when I finally had to toss the dutch oven. Used that thing for EVERYTHING! I've been lost without it and I'm on here now looking for it's replacement. Plus, my other family members have this set and are still using it after 17 years! But, they didn't put theirs in the dishwasher ever, which is why they still have theirs. Highly, highly, highly recommend!"
5,yellow jacket attractant,found this yellow jacket attractant on amazon at a most reasonable price ! i am allergic to yellow jackets and we have plenty - and thankfully product worked well and all are in trap. packed well and received quickly - will be buying again from this vendor in the spring.
2,They liked the hummingbird feeder much more.,I put this out by my hummingbird feeder hoping to redirect their activity but actually only caught one yellow jacket.
3,Who's singing?,"Well, I own about 80% of Andy McCoys material and love it all, I love this one as well, I just wish I did the singing for it, I have a hard time listening to music when the singing isn't up to par in my book so it doesn't get played too much. Luv U Andy! Keep Rockin'"
5,Sam Elliott and The Hole in the Sky,"This movie is something of a departure for Sam Elliott, but he, as always, pulls it off masterfully. Like fine wine, he just gets better with age.I think that the great strength of the film is its mood. Rather than a rousing story, although the story is interesting enough, watching it is just a pleasurable experience. The characters are believable, the scenery incredible (although it was shot in Canada rather than in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness), and is suitable for the entire family.If you are a fan of Elliott and/or just plain old good movies, then you should enjoy this one."
5,"Warm, like a favorite sweater.","Sam Elliott has the ability to both stamp his authority, and to give crediblity, to any film which includes him. For sleight of hand students it's always a genuine pleasure to watch the masterful card artistry of the great Ricky Jay (the cook). No camera tricks required here.A wonderful and believable tale for the whole family."
4,a well thought out story line,Great acting especially jerry o'connell he is a babe and i have a big crush on him im in love with him and i have loads of pictures of him. anyway back to the film was really supprised it has a great story line.
3,Interesting,"I think the leads did their parts well, but there was an emptiness to the story. But, worth watching it."
2,"worth a rent, but that's it","I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the write ups I had read about it. I must admit I was highly disappointed. The acting was good, but it was such a cliche storyline. Repressive husband, wife gets tired of it and starts to look for more. I guess I just didn't think it original. I didn't care for the lines or the chemistry between the cast."
4,brilliant but not smart,"Great Album ! great music and lyrics but not for a band like the mission! Hussey made three great masterpieces "" God's own medicine"" "" Children "" and Carved in Sand"" they sang classics songs as wasteland , Tower of strength and butterflies on a wheel i strongly agree that fans will be surprised when they will hear Hussey singing "" like a child again and stick and stones"" frankly i enjoyed it but not as their previous classic albums.too bad that the mission split up but i urge hussey to come back with a new mission and only one new member which is Julian regan from All about eve and to do together a new alternative rock album."
3,Terrible,"Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad...They should have negative star ratings for movies like this.If the British were such baffoons as this pictures makes them out to be, how did they have such an empire. Man, the rest of the world must have been filled with idiots."
1,Stuffy Liberal Anti-War Crap,"I was hoping to buy a decent movie about the events surrounding the charge of the light brigade, but instead was bored to tears with drug induced tirade about the evils of war and those evil military men who start wars. Very little if any historical accuracy in this movie."
3,"Good film, bad sound","The 1936 Warner Bros. ""Charge"" is a much more satisfying film. However this more modern version includes spectacular, beautiful ingenious animated sequences (including main title) by Richard Williams of Pink Panther fame. However again (!), the soundtrack of the film is shamefully shabby. It's tinny and bass-less. It sounds like it was recorded over the telephone. Those of us who invest a ton of money in home stereo systems for our DVD's deserve much better sound quality. This is APPALLING."
1,"Blurriest Movie Ever. For Shame, Amazon.","This movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of long movies about military history (don't bother if you aren't) but you won't see a thing on Amazon's version, which is sufficiently blurry so as to be unwatchable. I strongly advise renting the HD version on iTunes instead."
3,I Could Have Been More,"A dramatic moment confused with press gangs, snobbery, brutality, cuckholding, and rakish behaviour. The costuming and equipment account for the three stars. It is a shame a good book turned into a bad screen play and a dis-jointed movie. It just does not know what it wants to be, Sir John's abilities were better used in 'Arthur'. SAVE your money"
1,Really bad cinema,"This version (1968) of The Charge of the Light Brigade, is perhaps one of the worst movies it has been my misfortune to watch. The cinematography is bad, the plot line is non-existent, the acting is poor to awful. It doesn't even deserve one star, but that's the least I can give it. If you plan to buy The Charge of the Light Brigade, buy the original 1936 version with Errol Flynn.It starts off slow and terrible and quickly goes downhill. This is one dvd that was a complete waste of money. I don't say that about very many movies, as I can usually find something redeeming about most movies. This is one that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I've never written a review before, but this movie was so bad, I felt I had to warn people off so they didn't waste their money, as I did."
2,The Fake One's Better,I was surely looking forward to another version of this film. This side of the story was suppose to not be as fictional as the older Errol Flynn version. It needed more story line. I found it boring and to much dialog. Thumbs down.
2,TorpanInternational,"This film is a piece of historical record,but thats as far as it went.Im sad that the screen writer want to concentrate on forification ,as much as did.More explaination of the object ---history would have brought it up to a higher standard.Sorry it didnt go to 3 stars"
2,Don't waste your time,"This is one of the stupidest ""war"" movies ever made. Cheesy character acting, unnecessary side plots that make up 80% of the movie. They finally get to the Crimea about the last 30 minutes of the movie and show about 20% of the actual events during that battle in which the Turks fought well but the British floundered. Watch the history channel special on this event and save your money."
1,History meets Monty Python,"War is a serious business, but not to the makers of this film who every so often inserted an animation sequence most certainly inspired by those done by Monty Python. Except this is not a comedy. Made in 1968 the anti Vietnam war influence is also in evidence. If you do not like someone who is a history buff this would make a good present otherwise avoid this turkey."
3,Windows 98 for preschoolers!,"Despite this books 600+ pages, it's probably the most non-technical computer book I've ever read. It's clearly geared towards the ""just opened the box"" set, but, lets face it, not many people fall into that category with Win 98 nowadays. Anytime there's ever any mention of anything that seems technical, such as the Windows registery, the author simply says ""this is technical, don't mess with it.""If you have absolutely no computing experience whatsoever, consider this book. If you want something with any real meat, look elsewhere."
3,Good buy for the money.,This was an average children's book. I found it to be a good story for the cheap buy. If I would have picked it up in the store and been able to pre-read it before buy it I probably woudln't have bought it though. I gave it as a gift to my niece for Christmas and I doubt she's as picky about it.
4,"Another cute ""Night Before"" book","My daughter and I both love the ""Night Before"" series. This book is another reason why. It's both cute and clever."
5,Two out of two munchins agree...,"...this is their favorite Christmas story.As a housewarming gift, I picked up a pair of Christmas books for my friends' children last year. This year, their mother again thanked me for ""The Night Before the Night Before Christmas."" It had become her kindergartener's and pre-schooler's favorite. In fact, it was the only story the pre-schooler wanted to hear.For fun, I ordered myself a copy. It is now my favorite too. Following the cadences of ""The Night Before Christmas,"" readers are invited along to witness a typical, loving family's Christmas challenges. Page after page of endearing illustrations will enchant readers of all ages. Not even the most dedicated Grinch can resist.Don't wait another year to pick up this great story."
4,One of my favorite Christmas Movies...,"I love this movie because it is about family and bringing families together. It's one of those movies you can sit down with young children and not worry about little ears hearing things they shouldn't hear. It's a ""feel good"" movie with a happy ending. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it is not the best movie I have ever seen. But when I go away with a great feeling after a movie it gets pretty close!"
2,No response from seller.,"I did not realize I was ordering VHS tapes and have tried to contact seller for instructions on how to return one item. No response. I'm ok with keeping one copy of the movie since I still have a VHS player, but I don't need two copies. It's a really cute movie, but seriously, no one wants a VHS tape. I can't give it away and really just want to return it and get my money back."
5,All I want for Chirstmas,"Well, I was a bit hesitant in getting a used copy. After opening the movie I obsurved finger prints and some scratches on the DVD. I watched it to be sure it worked ok and it worked well. I would have liked it to have been in better condition and am hoping that I don't have any issues with it in the years to come.This is one of my favorite Christmas movies."
5,On my list of Christmas classics,"This is a Christmas classic, especially if you grew up in the '90s. I was 7 years old when the movie came out, and I still like it at 28."
1,"Great movie, but...","My sister and I love this movie, so I thought it would be perfect to buy so we could watch it together over the holidays. However, it does not play in any of my DVD players in the house. It shows maybe the first 20 minutes and then it just stops. I'm very disappointed and am now very leery about purchasing anything through Amazon."
1,Unabe to play on player,I was unable to play the video. I requested a return and received 1/2 of the purchase price.Next time I will only buy from Amazon sites and pay the higher cost.
5,Mom's favorite,This is my Mother's favorite movie. When her VHS went kaput I bought her the DVD. She was thrilled.
4,Fun Family Christmas Classic,This movie is a wonderfully fun Christmas time! We watch it every Christmas season. The plot is predictable but a young Thora Birch is an excellent asset. The comedy is fresh and the belly laughs are numerous. Lauren Bacall gives an excellent performance as Grandma. Children will love it and adults will appreciate the humor. It is a modern day Christmas classic.
4,Region 2 BEWARE!,"Purchased this from MovieMars. It will not play on any of my DVD players. Turns out it is a region 2. I requested an exchange for a region 1, but Moviemars refused. They said it is clearly marked. It is NOW, but wasn't when I ordered it. Said they would refund it minus shipping. Shipping it back cost more than I paid. This how they make their money I guess. 4 stars are for the movie! It's a great, clean family film!!! I was hoping to replace an old VHS copy that I recorded from TV years ago."
1,Didn't work,This video could not be read by any of our 3 DVD players nor either of our 2 computers. On the computers it gave us an error about language setting. I am not going to mess with my settings just to accomidate on DVD. I would like to return it if possible.
1,bad experience,"I thought i was getting a dvd i could view in the USA!Unfortunately it was for viewing in China!I was told i would have to pay for shipping to send it back,wow. This was from MovieMars,beware"
4,A Real American Beauty,Can you beleive how quickly she grew up? She looks great in the new film. And did a great job.
2,Not All I want For Christmas,"I love Christmas movies and was excited to find this one last year. I had never seen it before, but judging from the reviews I guess I expected more. I can think of so many holiday movies with more interesting storylines and more appealing characters. I can see that it would be appealing to preteens. I guess I've grown tired of scheming kids in movies and though I had no sympathy for the mother's boyfriend, I was not really entertained by their plot that hijacked him in an ice cream truck and had his car towed away. I love a great holiday comedy, but when I think of the really great ones, I can't say that this one comes close. I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if I could, because I like Lauren Bacall.I just watched it again this week to see if it was any better than I thought it was last year. My copy is going to be donated to a local thrift store. I don't think I need to see it again."
1,Support for Mr. Maltin,"Contrary to those who would contradict Mr. Maltin, this movie is the worst Christmas movie ever made--possibly the worst movie ever made. Wooden acting, ridiculous story, a leaden love story and unattractive leads made this ""holiday movie"" nearly unwatchable. Save yourself some the money and stick to the old classics...this one should have gone directly to the bargain bin."
5,Asking to Much of Santa Claus-Maybe,This is a good movie. Its a Christmas version of The Parent Trap and they did it perfectly right down to the girl asking Santa Claus to have their parents get back together. I also really liked the side story with the older brother trying to get together with another girl that hes attracted too. The scheme to get the parents together on Christmas eve at the end is really interesting. As I said this is a good movie.
5,Very useful but not for beginners,"I found this book very helpful and was able to set up a working OpenBSD firewall using it. I did have to consult the OpenBSD FAQs and other material on the Web, however.The only quibble I have with this book is its presumed target audience. The intro says ""Knowledge of Unix is not assumed,"" but I would recommend that you not even consider starting a firewall building project unless you have good knowledge of UNIX, networking, and basic system administration. If you're picking up this book with that background, though, you will find it a very detailed and helpful guide to setting up your firewall.By the way, the book is geared towards OpenBSD 2.5 but the website has a lot of good updated information on the latest release, 2.7. Plus it has a bunch more examples beyond what is in the book."
4,Great book overall,"A really good book and also a fun read (nothing dry and boring about this one). If you've had any formal education if computer science, it's likely you'll know a lot of what's in the first 2 or 3 chapters... but there also might be some material you don't know.I did think, however, that the authors could've toned down the windoze bashing a little. I don't necessarily like windows but I do think that it's probably the _right_ os for some who might also use linux/bsd for their firewalls if the authors wouldn't bash their desktop os of choice so much.Other than that, and I repeat, it's a very good book and worth reading if you're setting up a firewall for the first time."
5,Excellent Primer!,"This book is VERY well written. It was one of the very best technical books I have ever read. Some of the info is a little dated, but the topics discussed are GREAT history. I personally get tired of security writers dismissing older exploits as they are still being used today. In addition, the majority of the first half of the book is devoted to security background and explanation of the types of major exploits.This was the first tech book that I have ever read cover to cover. It was that interesting. The authors had a very conversational style that keeps you hooked and entertained.I HIGHLY recommend it."
2,This books lacks Brazilian Portuguese.,"This book is completely on Continental (or European) Portuguese.At times, dialogs between Brazilians are presented but words and sentence structure is Continental, something Brazilian speakers would never say or use. Don't get me wrong. This book is okay if your aim is to learn Continental Portuguese (10 millions of speakers). If you are interested in Brazilian Portuguese this book will be no use and might teach you wrong."
5,old skool breaks,Great album of west coast old skool breaks. This is a must have for your breaks collection for any EDM fan buy it used.
5,excellent disc,"this cd is really f'n good! starts off a bit slow, but as long as you have the speakers to do it justice, the disc picks up really well into the 3rd track and finishes really strong. having trouble keeping myself from wearing it out!"
5,Rookie Blue Season 1,Great show. Believable. Enjoyed the chemistry between the characters. Sam and Andy wow.... Will continue to watch starting with next season.
2,slightly boring,"was a bit disapointed in this series actually, was a bit to try hard for my liking, rather than letting the characters grow and getting to know them it felt very rushed and well boring, sorry"
1,"A discrace for those who protect and serve, what a joke!","This has to be the WORST COP SHOW EVER! When the main Officer gets her ass kicked on a regular basis and yells ""don't make me shoot you on my first day"" this is embarrassing for the real cops in BLUE. I can't believe a show like Third Watch gets the axe and this crap stays on? I would not want this DVD set if they paid me to take it!Third Watch: The Complete First Season"
1,Very Formulaic. It's like watching Grey's Anatomy All over again,Not worth watching. The very peculiar it doesn't even mention in the show where they are and which Police Department. Very Generic.
3,"""Not just for builders?"" Try ""Not for builders""","While this book was a thorough and up-to-date authority on many many hardware subjects, the actual building tutorial was quite lacking. If I remember correctly there were like 10 pages on a Socket 7 processor installation and very little else. I hardly think this book could walk you step-by-step through the process of building a computer and this is no idiot speaking. I am coming from a strong computer and programming background (VB, C++, Java, Perl, HTML) and I even knew how to make some minor upgrades like installing PCI cards and new hard drives. By the way, for the absolute best guide on the internet please please please visit PC Mechanic Their free tutorial is superb and discusses absolutely every element of building a new system."
3,To: Mr. Aubrey Pilgrim.,"English is not my mother tongue. But I was educated partly in the US. Frankly, I was appalled by the way you write. You, as a published author, I expected more from you. At least, most people would expect you to have a better command of your native language than those of us who are not native speakers of English. I have not read your book, but based on the comment you made here, I have a feeling that Mr. Steve Davy does have some good reasons to make those comments about you. In the tradition of ""Freedom of Speech"" in America, I hope you don't mind me for saying so."
4,I like this one better than the disposable ones.,"The Disposable Rescue fly trap does work better, but you have to refill it 3x as often and I had one fail on me, getting that stinky smell all over me. I have used this version for many years and it always works. (Well, after about 10 years in the sun, one did dry and crack and finally failed.) Other than that, they do trap a lot of flys. Note: Where you put them has a lot to do with how many flys you get. Try experimenting with location. See my review on the disposable ones for more info.I do recommend this product."
1,Fly Trap?,I have had this product sitting on my patio table for two days now and it hasen't trapped a single fly. It does seem to attract them though. I have seen two or three flys walking on the lid while two or three of them are landing on me. They walk in the holes on top and walk right out. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it. I will try to return it to Home Depot where I bought it and look for something else.
2,Not really that great.,"Bought this and ""Sterling NFT-D Disposable Fly Control TrapWith Attractant""After a week this Jar had about 50 flies in it.The other, had hundreds.Only downside to the bag working so great is its pretty much already full after 2 weeks and I need a new one.Might just dish out the money for a bug zapper."
1,STINKY! Horrible Smell,"The thing stunk so bad after putting the water in it, my wife made me throw it away. There was no where in the yard it could have gone without us smelling it."
1,not for fruit flies and *definitely* not for indoor use,"This was listed as working for fruit flies in addition to regular flies. After a week in my apartment I noticed no difference in the number of fruit flies (and none were visible inside it) so I am going to declare it not to work for fruit flies at all. It may work for normal, big flies, but not for fruit flies.The bigger issue is that it smells INSANELY bad. Like, it's hard to believe how bad it smells. It nearly triggered my gag reflex both filling it and emptying it. During normal, sitting still usage, it still smells awful. You'd come in the apartment and smell it immediately, even after a few days of it sitting still.Definitely avoid this for indoor use, and don't get you hopes up about it catching fruit flies."
2,Not as effective as had hoped... and it REEKS!!!!!,"We leave a bowl of food out for our outdoor cats, and it attracts a LOT of flies... this fly trap has helped somewhat, but the results are minimal. The odor from the trap is absolutely horrific and unbearable. If you don't have a bowl of pet food sitting outside, perhaps this trap will work for you (and definitely place it where you won't smell it!)."
1,"stinks, and doesn't work","This product stinks like something dead and rotting. It stinks as far as function, also. After a full week in use, there are no flies in it at all. If you try to use this indoors (although it clearly states on the package that it is for outdoor use) It will make the whole room stink too."
3,Works well but dont spill it.,I got to say this was a good product. no problem there. it did what it was suppose to. but boy was I sorry when i spilled it. Stinks to high heaven. had to use bleach on the floors to get the stink out. not good at all.
2,avearage,The bait did not seem to do the job. The jar seems to be adequate but I have used other fly traps that did much better at attracting flies. I intend to find a different bait and still use this container
2,Attracts more than it kills,"Sure, there are plenty of dead and dying flies in there, so in that regard it works. But it also attracts more flies than it captures. Pretty sure it's luring all the flies in our neighborhood to our yard. The point was to be able to sit outside without having flies land on us and our food. We put the bag just far enough away from our patio that we couldn't smell it, but its not that easy for a fly to figure out how to get inside it, so they swarm around it and then come find easier food sources like our meal. The fly problem is just as bad if not worse with the trap. Won't be buying again."
1,Doesn't Work,"I got this to reduce the number of flies on the patio when we eat dinner outside.Bottom line, it does not work...flies were flying around all over, and not one went in the trap.I put it near the garbage cans for 2 days, and I caught 1 fly."
2,"Half right, it attracts flies, as for trapping them...","This product does a great job attracting flies, as for trapping them...the entry holes are large and the system works on the premise that the flies will enter and then tire and die in the solution contained. The bait smells in the vicinity of rotting fish. Working on this premise I took a small sliver of fish mixed with a few drops of apple cider vinegar and derived a more effective trap from an empty bottle and funneled piece of paper."
2,Not so good.,"I have used the rescue brad fly traps and they work well. Because of this I tryed the reuseable trap. I place this trap in the same place I have used the other traps and I had far, far, far less flys in the trap at the end of the week. I went back to the old style and started to catch alot of flys again. In short dont use the reuseable traps if you want to catch alot of flys."
1,Flys go in and come right out. Not a good trap,I had high expectations for this product. I used the RESCUE! FTD-DT12 Disposable Fly Trap in the past and was very happy. I thought I would save money with a reusable trap but I was surprised. Flys are atracted and enter this trap only to be able to leave right away. I strongly recomend the ftd-dt12 disposable one.
4,trudeau drivetime travel mug,"This mug in general is nice. Keeps liquids hot. Fits in cup holder in car without a problem. The top screws on. To drink, the dial on the top needs to be turned. This can be a pain. It is fairly leak-proof. For the price, it is a decent travel mug."
3,Cap is tricky,Cap is a bit too sophisticated and one broke immediately. I would prefer simpler caps.
3,"good design, some flaws","These mugs are very well-insulated and the lid is designed so that coffee won't slosh all over your car if you go over a bump in the road (the lid has an integrated disc which drops down when you switch the mug to open). The lid mechanism also limits the flow of your beverage as well so that you can avoid coffee stains on freshly laundered shirts. The only design flaw is that the mug tapers at the base making it difficult to clean and causing it to fit loosely in my car's cupholders (VW). Also, the lid mechanism does not disassemble easily for cleaning. Overall, high quality for the price with some drawbacks."
1,Leaky but vacuum tight,This travel mug is cute and fits into my car cup holder but it leaks! So I drink it with top off once I get to work. But by the time I get there (a whole 10 mintes later) some sort of heat vacuum thing has happened and I can't get the lid off- no joke.
3,pretty but not the best,"I love this cup until I spilt coffee all down my shirt. I showed my husband the no spill factor and he was impressed then we were driving and I thought that the lid was on all the way, apparently not. It felt tight but unless I over-tightened it it would leak when tipped. Now every once in a while I forget to over do it and end up with a coffee stain on my shirt."
5,Does not leak or spill!,I Love the red color. It keeps drinks hot and doesn't leak. I just need it in more colors now!
4,Finally!,I've looked for this CD for years and finally found it. A little known band that published too few songs but is a mainstay on my MP3 player now!
3,No Label,"Plain black jewel case, no front cover or track list providedThe picture shows the front cover to the CD, i am pretty disappointedthe CD does play well and has no scratches, would have been nice if it had everything"
5,"If you're old enough to remember the original TV series, you're gonna love this!","This is such a cute movie and the chemistry between Anne and Steve is awesome...comedic genius for writing, directing and acting. So funny."
4,smart spy,Steve Carell does a good job keeping the Maxwell Smart persona alive and well. funny movie.
3,Get Smart,"Item I purchased was listed as Used, Like-New. The disc was pristine, but the case was from a rental store (Blockbuster). Due to the odd size case the movie will not fit with into my bookcase with my other videos!"
5,Great Movie,Great funny movie you can't go wrong with this. Steve Carell is great at playing Maxwell Smart.
2,Get Smart,"Nobody can belly up to the original...sad copy. Acting forced...plot lacked the original ingenuity. I'm sorry, but I don't think Steve Carell is funny..."
2,I demand the cone of silence!,"Mel Brooks movies do fine at the box office, so why do we need to add a bunch of explosions, a competent Kaos, and make Max a highly skilled analyst who only makes mistakes because he is a new agent. The whole premise of the show is violated. That and maybe there were 6 Buck Henry style jokes in the whole movie (which was too long).I'm sure 'The Rock' is a nice guy, but he is overexposed at this point.Steve Carell does a pretty good job as Max, he is just not written as a blundering incompetent. I do miss Don Adams voice though. Anne Hathaway is beautiful and has a smokin' hot body and looks great modeling retro fashion, but she doesn't shine in the part of 99, maybe because Max written this way doesn't need a straight wo(man).To sum it up, its just not funny, and it's not trying to be funny, its trying to be a vanilla action film using an established brand."
3,"hilarious 1st 1/3, ok 2/3, dismal 3/3","Saw the poor reviews, decided to give it a shot, LOVED the first third. Went down from there. Ending typical Hollywood crap: Excessive car chase, no dialog, typical ending. Advice: Try to get it for free, watch ~1/2, and be satisfied."
2,"Hate Warner Brothers, Love Get Smart","This is a cute movie, but if you bought the Get Smart BluRay hoping to use the digital copy it comes with, you're out of luck. The included digital copy disk expires December 9, 2009. Warner Brothers response to my request for an updated key for the digital copy on my brand new disk was this:""We have researched your issue and this Digital Copy offer has expired. The Digital Copy offer is for a limited time only. The terms of the offer are specifically stated on the outside packaging. The Digital Copy offer is intended to be available for a limited time for discs purchased near the initial release date.""Bonus points to anyone who can actually find that stated on the packaging. I found it buried in fine print on the digital copy key page inside the case after it was already too late. Guess it's time to make my own DRM free digital copy..."
1,Waste of time,This is a remake that should have never been done. It lacks the style of the series. It is a wate of time and money watching it.
3,Well Made...But Couldn't Make Up Its Mind,"Steve Carrell was an excellent choice to play Maxwell Smart, the production is first rate, and the rest of the cast is very good...but I kept wanting more spoof and less spying. There were too many moments when the story played its intrigue story straight at the expense of the comedy (that and Mike Meyers' limited sex and fart jokes killed the Austin Powers films).Still, some good moments, very well made (it looks good enough to actually be a glossy spy film!), I just wish it had more humor in it. Either way, it's entertaining."
4,"Yep, missed it by that much...","I'm a big fan of the original series. It had it all: comedy, romance, political satire, physical comedy and action. The humor was both broad and subtle. The movie captured the broad strokes, but missed the subtle humor. Carrel made the role his own and was very good. Hathaway as 99 worked pretty well. Arkin's role as the chief was good. The physical comedy was good. The romance worked. The relationship between Max and the chief worked. The cone of silence and the other gadgets were excellent. Some of the scenes fell flat. The homage to the car and the shoe phone of the original show was good.In summary, the movie was good. It missed some of the political satire and subtle humor of the original show, but for a movie made from a TV series it was very good. My wife and I laughed a lot, which is the major test of a movie like this."
3,Carell as Maxwell Smart,I thought this movie was pretty funny. I was a fan of the origional Get Smart and loved Max and 99 back in the day. This movie is a good companion piece of that show and holds up on its own. I also like that Max wasn't portrayed as a Xerox copy of the Don Adams Maxwell Smart. Ann Hathaway is also really good as 99 but portrays her as more of a tough as nails hardcore kick butt sexy agent. The Rock is pretty good but nothing great. I also am a huge Alan Arkin fan and thought he did a good job. Also the little tribute to Hyme was a nice touch.
5,Great Friggin Movie,"I actually didnt really like the Tv show much, but this movie is great and im so glad to hear there making a sequel"
2,GET REAL,A movie I won't miss-------------weak. Steve Carell can do better work than this. Get some better scripts. I gave the movie to my sister.
5,its obvious,"it is obvious that folks who claim that this movie is horrible and isnt the same as the original show are half correct. It isnt like the original show, the reason being is that it had to be updated for this generation. Having watched this movie and the original series (not the ghastly attempt to revive the series), this movie is in the same vein as the original show. To have Mel Brooks (one of the original series creators) to give his blessing to this movie is saying something. Granted this movie or series isnt for everyone and yet you are doing a disservice to yourself if you dont understand the humor."
4,A very funny movie,"I was a fan of the old TV showand this movies does that no harm!I'm also a big Anne Hathaway fan and she pulls offthe comedy acting well.With the Bush administration making the spy business a bad word,it is refreshing to see something ""fresh"" if it is a revival.The latest Bond movie is a real sell out!Most of the jokes were is good taste,unlike another spoof spy movie that it on three remakes.I was just thinking about buying the TV series DVD for someone in the family for Christmas."
3,Campy but not quite there,"Smart himself isn't bad and the Cone of Silence almost worked. But it lacked the light touch of the old show. I didn't like 99 much. Still, I give the writers marks for trying to say true to the old series. Not bad, but not quite good enough."
3,Ok....Just,"I'm a big fan of the original series.I expected a very good movie here.I thought they had found a good character to play Maxwell Smart in Steve Carell.But i think the script itself was a bit lacking something.Also it was annoying to see other people play the parts of the original characters who did not resemble them one iota.It seemed they were trying a modern approach,that to me simply didn't work.I started off enjoying it but half an hour or so into it, i was beggining to wonder.I wouldn't say i hated it,but at the same time i don't think i would watch it again for a while."
2,If not for Anne Hathaway......,"Yeah, this pretty much sucked...a few laughs, nothing very memorable. I was really hoping for something decent with Steve Carrel and all....but, Anne Hathway...DAMN! Her hotness burns through the suck so you can actually make your way to the end of the suckness."
5,GREAT WORK,This was an extremely funny and yet touching movie it went beyond the old tv series and opened a new avenue of enjoyment. wouldn't be surprised if they came out with a sequel.
3,Decent Diversion,"Sometimes a little wacky, SNL ish, but a nice diversion with a few laughs for your pleasure. Not a great movie, but decent."
3,Rent it,"So this movie is not bad. It is Not one of those movies where all the funny parts are in the previews (i truly hate those movies). However this is no Tommy Boy either. This movie will keep you entertained if you have never seen it before and it is quite comical. However watching it more than once really is not worth it so don't waste the money and buy it, just rent it."
4,Smarty pants.,"Get Smart starring Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway is a cute and funny film based on the classic t.v. show. Carell is a riot like always but it's Hathaway who steals the movie, she doesn't fit the Agent 99 role but somehow she makes it work. I really liked this film, check it out sometime!"
2,Watch the TV series,"Attempts to combine comedy into an action movie. Well, its not very funny and not very exciting. If you are a fan of the old TV series, you will be disappointed. Stick to the TV series."
5,It's funniest comedy!!!,I like comedy movies and this movie is fun and action movie. The characters are fun. So they doing action just great. I laughing a lot. I enjoyed the movie.
2,Get Dumb,"For the people who gave this five stars - what would you give The Godfather? Or Star Wars? Are you out of your minds? ""Get Smart"" is a relatively pleasant, liteweight popcorn movie good for a quick laugh and then best forgotten. The idea of making Agent 86 a bumbling genius as opposed to a bumbling idiot completely misses the point of the original series."
1,So bad.,"Initial reviews I read said this movie was terrible so I skipped seeing it in the theater. I've since read some reviews that said ""Hey it's really not that bad"". YES IT REALLY IS THAT BAD. It's so bad that if you looked up ""Bad Movie"" in the dictionary they'd say ""See Movie: Get Smart"". It's really that bad. Is it worth a 99 cent rental? Not even. What a disappointment, and I love Steve Carrel and especially the Rock. But this movie is totally stupid. If you read this and still rent it, you'll later kick yourself for not taking my advice. Wait until TBS is showing it in a weekend marathon or something."
3,Fun,"Like the title says, it's fun, some funny moments and hilarious scenes. It's the kind of movie you watch once and move on."
4,Funny movie,Get Smart is a funny movie. The combination of Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway unexpectedly provided good laughs and good acting. It is entertaining to watch for the whole family. Blu- ray picture quality is excellent. Sound reproduction added another dimension to the movie.
5,wonderful interactio,This came in the mail quickly and was in mint condition. Great to do business with.
2,Meh,I thought this would be a fun dvd to share with my grandkids. NOT. More violent than I expected it to be.
5,Good buy,This is one of the funniest movies I have seen! LOL funny. Steve Carell does Maxwell Smart perfectly and Anne Hatheway is the perfect 99.Thanks for the good product and the fast service.
3,Fun!,"Love anything with Steve Carell. This was a fun movie to watch with my boys, who both love silly spy movies."
4,Get Smart in a Smart Edition,"Get SMart is a good movie. I give it a 3/5. But this edition is great. Altough the Digital Copy expired, it paid of when it came with a lenticular sleeve cover. The price was great and it arrived 2 days after I ordered it. Altought the extended edition wasn't that great it did have some funny scenes. If you are thinking of buying this, go for it."
4,a fun show,It came on time and in good condition. We haven't watched it yet since we've owned it. We watched it when we rented it and my husband really enjoyed the show. Steve Carrell is pretty funny.
3,Corny and Entertaining Action/Comedy,There is no doubt that the cast in Get Smart is enjoyable to watch on screen. Whether you enjoy Steve Carrell Anne Hathaway or the Rock all of them put in a decently good performance that entertains you. Is the movie great? No not by a long shot. The movie rolls at a decent pace and you are able to watch Steve Carrell get himself into crazy situation only to be bailed out every time.To be honest I didn't expect much and I doubt many people will. That is why Get Smart is a perfect three star movie. It is good enough to entertain you for an evening but nothing more than that.
3,Missed it by this much!,"Get smart was okay, kinda funny but not great and not hilarious. Granted, I have never been a big fan of the TV show, so maybe I am not the target audience, but after some pretty good reviews from reviewers that I often agree with, I thought I'd give it a shot, and as I said, it wasn't a bad movie, but I'm glad that I only rented the video on demand from Amazon, because I doubt that I would want to re-watch this movie again.So here's the deal, if you LOVE 'Get Smart' you will probably like this movie very much; however, if you just like Steve Correl, Ann Hathaway and the Rock, then I would just rent this like I did."
3,Not Bad,"I went into this like everyone else thinking this would be terrible. I was surprised. The movie is not bad. What makes it good is the names are the same, but the characters are different. If the actors in the picture tried to imitate the originals it would have been terrible. Instead they created new characters and the only similarity are the names. As a fan of the original show I thought this was a good effort. Very funny and entertaining."
3,JUST OK,Well I thought this would be a better movie it was not as funny as it looked even my daughter told me to turn it off!!
4,better than I thought,I went into seeing this movie thinking it would be just another dumb remake of a TV show. I was very wrong about that. The movie was entertaining and had good action from beginning to end. I mean the fight scenes were well coreographed as well as the explosions/special effects were well done. This is the first movie that Carrell had the leading role that I really liked. The supporting cast also meshed well to make this a good movie. I would recommend this movie for anyone looking for a good laugh and some action.
4,Better than the show!,"This comic film based on the old spy parody series is the best comedy of the decade!Comic genius Steve Carell and sexy Anne Hathaway star in this classic comedy as Maxwell Smart and 99!Loaded with Deleted Scenes and Alternate Versions,this dvd is a great buy!"
3,not bad,"It's not your tv get smart, but it is entertaining enough to watch more than once. Steve Carrol is funny as Maxwell Smart and the surrounding cast does well enough to let you see it more than once."
3,Not What I Expected,"If you're expecting to roar like you did when you were a kid at Maxwell Smart, forget it. This movie just doesn't pull it off in the timing and delivery of the jokes and slapstick humor. I was very disappointed."
5,Get Smart Sent Smart,This person delivered promptly and product was well-packaged and in great condition.Thank you.S
3,"5 Star Movie, 3 Star Blu Ray","This is a very entertaining movie. Steve Carell is absolutely perfect for this role; a very minor extension of his Office ignoramus role. Obviously it gets a little sluggish near the end, but the earlier parts more than compensate. The Blu Ray is a little disappointing though. Very grainy."
1,GET...something else,"There will never be a sequel to this movie, you know why? Because it sucked. Steve Carell is perfect on his T.V. show and as a 40 year old virgin, but in general he is not a strong lead in movies. This movie would of been more entertaining back 1999, but now it's insulting."
1,Plain old Boring!,"I remember GET SMART with fondness and loved watching it with my dad in the 60's-early 70's, so I guess I was expecting too much from this film and I actually left the theater about 40 mins. in. It just was not funny. It tried hard with the gadgets, and quips from the TV show, but for me it just didn't connect at all. I'm not being critical, just honest."
1,CAN'T WATCH IT!!!!!,"Listen to this old saying and remember it: Never Trust Anything digital from Amazon.I paid money to watch it online and I can't watch it. Horrible, absolutely horrible. Now I know some of you gonna criticize me and tell me things like ""then don't rate it"" or ""this review is irrelevant"". My response is how is it irrelevant? Imagine you pay for a product and you got nothing, of course it's a horrible product. And I hope this serves a warning to everyone."
4,Get Smart,Can't Wait to get this! It looks so funny!Everything I've ordered from here I was neverdisappointed!
4,Feeling It,Most soundtracks don't stand out in a movie. This particular soundtrack had my eyes and ears plugged in. All the songs on it are amazing. A Bildungsroman (coming of age) of captivating memories and eloquently narrated. I definately give my thumbs up to a swell movie and a soundtrack that does justice to the idea of a Bildungsroman.
3,Good Soundtrack,"This is an acceptable soundtrack, but I need to know what's the name of that song that plays when the guys are road trippin', and one of them changes the radio and causes his friends to complain...This very song also plays in ""Storytelling"". Please, I need to know."
5,"""Go Shopping"" -- and buy this CD! Ahora!","As great as the film ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is, it just wouldn't be the same without the music, which is a character in and of itself. The songs on the soundtrack will send you on a road trip to sonic places that are worth visiting again and again. If you don't know anything about Mexican music, you're in for a big surprise -- and a real treat. I'm sitting here at work with the Cafe Tacuba song ""Insomnio"" in my head, and I couldn't be happier. The bouncy fun of ""Here Comes the Mayo"" and ""Go Shopping"" will hook you even if you don't speak Spanish. And there's a Frank Zappa song at the end. You can't go wrong!"
3,y Tu Mama Tambien,"I bought this to practice learning Spanish - listen to the words in Spanish and, as needed, read the subtitles. They talk very fast and I had much difficulty understanding them. I was able to learn some latin american slang.The story is okay and the movie's well done. It would probably appeal primarily to those in the their teens and twenties. A couple of very macho just post-high school dudes take a just separated-from-her-husband older woman for a beach getaway. The men bicker and can't perform sexually to her expectations. The ending has an interesting albeit sad twist.There is some good latin american rock in the background."
5,a great movie,I have loved this movie from the moment I first saw it and I just cant stop watching it.
5,I already have the clow book set!!!,"andI'm very happy with it!!! the package is great. it really look like the clow book. I just wish they'd put an insert in it but oh well it is great anyway. for this set I hope they respect the original color of the sakura book and one last note, please Amazon lower the price of this set. when it was first launched in pre release the price was 74.99 just like the first set but now??? I never knew a case before in wich the price goes up before the actual release!!! well unfortunately I won't be able to buy it form Amazon if they don't lower the price at least 10 bucks. well anyway thanks for a great great great overseas service Amazon!!!"
5,"absorbing, wonderful","i was waaaaay too into this book when i was a kid. it's shaped my life. definitly give it to your sci-fi-prone, cat-loving daughters. it'll give 'em confidence and a great little world to get lost in."
2,Decent,Although for Millencolin this is medicore. First check out Life on a Plate which is their best album followed by a matured Pennybridge Pioneers and by the pretty good For Monkeys. This is the worst way to get your first taste of Millencolin since it's clearly not in the same class as their previous releases.
2,It's OK...,"I recently got this CD, and I have been a Millencolin fan for years now. I really liked Pennybridge Pioneers, and I was really excited about the new direction the band was going in. But I have to say ""Home From Home"" is mediocre at best. The song ""Kemp"" is the best song, and ""Happiness For Dogs"" is good but sounds like something right off Pennybridge. But the rest is pretty bland and weak. If I were you I would pass on this album, stick to the older material. Life on a Plate, For Monkeys, and Pennybridge is Millencolin at their best!"
3,Decent,"I cant really describe why I felt let down by this album but I just did. Although I still like most of the songs on this album, I would much rather listen to ""Life on a Plate"" as well as ""Pennybridge Pioneers"". To this day, ""Life on A Plate"" is one my favorite albums and this new album pales in comparison to that one."
3,"Good. But, Sub-Par for the Swedes.","I was anxious to buy this album when I heard Millencolin was comin' out with a new one. Within the first few weeks I purchased it at the local record store. The Swedish punks really wrote some quality songs for ""Home from Home."" But the 3-Star rating is due to the apparent fact that there is alot of filler in here. There are just too many songs on here that don't meet up to my expectations for these guys. Still, if you are looking for a new CD, go ahead and get it. There are some real good tracks on here, just not enough of them."
5,Awesome CD no doubt must have,"I haven't heard Millencolin's past CDs..but regardless of their past, this is a very good CD. I will now rate the individual songs:1. Man or Mouse - Pretty catchy song. Medium paced. I like it alot. 9/102. Fingers crossed - Another catchy song..fast paced punk. 8/103. Black eye - OK song I guess. Probably my least favorite. Medium paced. 6/104. Montego - Good song. Cool guitar riffs. Medium paced. 7/105. Punk Rock Rebel - Cool guitar riffs. I like this one. 10/106. Kemp - Really catchy. 8/107. Botanic Mistress - Another cool song. 7/108. Happiness for Dogs - My favorite along with #5. 10/109. Battery Check - OK song I guess. Not one of my favorites. 7/1010. Fuel to the Flame - Cool guitar riffs. 7/1011. Afghan - I like this one. I bit different on the vocals than the others. 7/1012. Greener Grass - Cool song. 7/1013. Home from Home - Fast paced awesome guitar riffs etc. 9/10Bottom line..if you like punk rock, then this is a must have.A"
3,Listen to it before you buy it,"I heard a lot of people saying that Pennybridge Pionners sucked and that the band has become sellouts with this album. But after listening to it a couple of times it became my favorite cd. Something fun with millencolin is that every time they release a new cd, they always come up with something a little different but keeping what makes it a excellent band. Unfortunately, with Home from Home, it wasn't the same. Sure this cd is not like any of their previous albums and its pretty good music but it really doesn't reach what a used to expect from such an amazing band. If you like good punk rock, buy life on a plate, if you want a amazing punk album from a band that really got is own style, and is able to make punk music grow, I highly suggest you pennybridge pionners witch is,in my opinion their best album. For monkeys is incredible too."
2,I really wanted to love this but...,"I had really high hopes for this brand. I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I've been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?I'm gonna try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I'll write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!!"
5,Great product,"I live in Puerto Rico and cannot find Thai food here, let alone ingredients.I bought this and the red curry paste too. I had never made my own currybefore, but with the help of this, I made restaurant quality curry! There is quitea bit of product in the container, so it will last if refrigerated. Watch the shippingcosts from outside vendors. They will not combine shipping in some cases."
3,OK Product,"I like other styles of Mae Ploy curry paste, but the green just doesn't work for me. Overwhelming garlic, no heat, and very bland. I would not purchase this product again."
4,Great photgraphs and fascinating details,"I've purchased several of the books on the Wright Brothers released in anticipation of the centennial. This is the best I've read so far. I especially enjoyed the many photographs of the several Flyers and of the brother's home, workshop and test locations in Dayton and NC.I also appreciated the way the author examined and explained many technical details of how the flyer was rigged and how the controls operated.This is one of the few books about the Wrights that explains the true importance of what the Wrights discovered, the secret of coordinated control of roll and yaw.This book is well disserving of space on the coffee table of any aviation enthusiast."
3,Harlem Postcards by Siskind,"It was barely worth the four bucks I paid. Most of the pictures were too dark or of poor subject matter. I was born and raised in Harlem, so I know. I kept four of the thirty postcards in the book and threw the rest away."
5,Terrific first reader,"What a charming, delightful first reader! I began reading this book to my son when he was just over a year old, and for months it was always his first choice. The story and illustrations have a wonderful, irresistible energy akin to the best works of Dr. Seuss."
4,Works as advertised!,"This cartridge does the trick, for sure. At the end of its lifespan (the advertised 10 weeks) there were about fifty yellowjackets in the trap, which is great! Next spring I plan on putting a few of these out in the yard to hopefully attract the larger queens to avoid having new nests built."
1,Yellow Jacket attractant,I have not trapped any yellow jackets in my trap. This review might be unfair as it might have been a different type of stinging insect in my yard.
1,No Luck with this yet....,"I bought this lure and rebaited my Yellow Jacket Trap from last summer. We had a hot dry summer in Atlanta last year and were simply swarmed with the mean beasties. I figured that putting out the lure would snag the queens out flying around and prevent nests in my yard this year. The trap (rebaited) has been out for 3 weeks and hasn't attracted a single queen... or even a wasp for that matter. I got tons of yellow-jackets with hotdog pieces last summer and I can guarantee that hot dog pieces were a LOT cheaper than this lure. I will leave it out with this bait (said to be good for 10 weeks) and then go back to my tried and true hot dog bits. At this point, it looks like I wasted my money. I will update this at the end of the 10 weeks and see if things improve."
1,Great product - Don't buy here!,"Don't get fleeced by their shipping charges ($45 shipping on a $50 order)! Buy from ""Attic Truck"" instead. Product works great!"
1,Didn't work,Did not attract yellow jackets. Simply didn't work. None in trap after 4 weeks despite many flying around my yard.
1,Dried out,The attractant was dry when I received it. I placed it into the trap anyways and it has not caught a single yellow jacket in over a month. I would suggest going to a local store and buying instead of ordering from the merchants online.
1,Dry and Expired,Ive used this refill product before with great results when purchased at a store. When ordering from amazon I received an expired product that was too dry to attract my targets.
1,Worthless!,"I wish I could get a refund. We put these near the nests and caught NOTHING! Re-read the instructions several times to ensure we had done it correctly. Extremely disappointing . This product is worthless. Meanwhile, I'm out $20 and I still have yellow jackets swarming my house and building nests everywhere. Save your money!"
4,It's Nicer Outside Now,"For the last serveral years I had an increasing problem with yellow jackets on my property. I always thought I could simply leave them alone and not be troubled, but that stopped for me when they invaded my patio umbrella. I got stung putting away the umbrella and a few days later ended up in the urgent care with a swollen wound on my knee.Early this spring I purchased this attractant with the trap, and reloaded the attractant in July. It is now early August and I have had very little yellow jacket activity near my house. However, in the trap at the far edge of my property there are 100+ dead and trapped yellow jackets! Even the most attractive nesting sites on my property are empty this year, and the few nests that I have found seem tiny and abandoned."
1,Didn't work as advertised,I was up for 14 days and trapped 1 yellowjacket despite there being quite a few around bothering the hummingbirds. The original liquid attractant that came with the original trap caught about 20 over the course of 4 days.
1,"Nothing, and I mean nothing",Got yellow jackets flying all over the place but not one has the least bit of interest for this trap... waste of time and money.
4,A gambler's comedy,Where's the DVD? This is a sport gambler's comedy GEM...waiting to add to my DVD collection upon release! Highly recommend busting a gut viewing this with the beer buddy's following a football game.
5,Typical Sony quality,Not much to say except it works like a sony and is built to last! Hight quality images and has a low light feature that is pretty awesome!
2,Not Mint Condition,"I bought Simple Plan No pads, No Helmets..Just Balls. The cd cover looks like it got printed off not the original plus the cd case is cracked."
1,Don't buy it...,Boy band with guitars. This CD is not worth buying. Don't know why people compare it to Greenday or Blink 182 sounds nothing like them.
2,Not Bad,"This CD isn't bad, but I have to admit that they don't have the best of voices. They don't have a lot of talent, but they're an ok band."
4,Awesome,"Awesome CD, but I want to avoid confusion between all the great pop/punk bands in the world and let everyone know that the song ""One Slowdance"" refered to in the first post is actually a song by the pop/punk band Rufio, and not Simple Plan."
5,Love it!,"I love this CD!! It's fun and catchy, and the music is awesome!I'm confused with the people who claim to ""hate SP with a passion"" because you can either like them or not...but to hate them with a passion?? They must have gotten to you and stuck in your head! ;) Catchy stuff!Anyhow, the vocals are great because they are unique and raw. I love how it sounds honest and unsynthesized. The music itself rocks!! It's even more obvious how excellent of musicians they all are as individuals when you hear them live, but I still love this CD. If you haven't heard Simple Plan, check out ""Perfect"" and ""Addicted"", they are really great. I think ""God Must Hate Me"" is really funny and so is ""I'm Just a Kid."" The video to ""I'm Just A Kid"" is hilarious - you can see it on [...] under Videos. I just discovered that recently and laughed my ass off at it. You can see the band isn't taking themselves too seriously! Anyhow, the CD rocks although I like their ""Hard Rock Live"" Cd even more!"
4,wyverna,"Y'know what? I like this album, and before you go judging me calling me a ""poseur"" or ""wanna-be"" or whatever, don't you think you're being a poseur by disliking music because it's not ""cool"" or whatever? If you've listened to it and you still don't like it, good, but judge the music, not the band.I like the songs, they put me in a good mood and they're cheerful and good to dance to. Simple Plan don't take themselves seriously, and I like that. I like the way most kids can identify with the songs - it's good to know that someone's been through or knows what you're going through, and came out the other side. I think that this CD is worth the money, and it certainly puts a smile on MY face."
1,this is so total punk dude!,"oh yeah, this is super punk! i coldnt believe the total critisms against simple plan, they rule! they are totally punk i mean it! despite them being in their 30s and still just whining monotonusly about being 12 in the suburbs. when your 12 you should not listen to this, b cuz then you'll be embarrassed when you're 13. or 14 or 15. ""I'm Just A KId?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" they're like 20. make good music not music you can live off of from 20-29."
5,Awesome to the ear!!,"These 5 guys have gathered together there musical talents and make an etremely awesome pop-punk cd! The songs are catchy and leave you wanting to hear more. ""I'm just a kid"" and ""I'd do any thing"" their hit singles and their almost released single ""addicted"" are all on the cd and very cool as well. You will hear voices such as Mark Hoppus's from Blink 182 and Joel Madden's from Good Charlotte. This is a very good cd and I think you should check it out now!!!"
1,I can't believe that people buy this SH*T!,"I did not buy this album. I stole 5 of them because I wanted to have coasters for the beer that I will drink to forget about this album. First off: I joined Amazon just to say how sucky this piece of crap album is. A co-worker of mine listens to this at work and then he cries all day because he can't figure out why he likes it. WHAT IS PUNK? NOT THESE GUYS! I read an interview in a Guitar World magazine called,"" Guitar Legends, Punk Rock Special"" YES, Punk ROck Special. They had Tim Armstrong and Jade Puget. Yes, Rancid and AFI. Then they had the lead singer from Simple Plan giving a wrinkled up, I'm Super-Hardcore Face. What the F***! I oughta kill myself. If Simple Plan is Punk, then Backstreet boys are Black Flag. Simple Plan, I have a simple plan for you: STOP MAKING MUSIC or at the very least, STOP CALLING YOURSELVES A PUNK BAND. NO PADS NO HELMETS NO BALLS!"
5,Awesome new Punk Pop CD!,"This CD is just awesome! It is great for all you pop punk loving fans! I love every single song on this CD. It is sweet! Some of my fav songs on the Cd include Just a Kid, One Day, My Alien.. and so on. I love them all. If you love pop punk (and even if you dont) this cd is a must buy. I saw them in concert the other day and they are also awesome live! BUY IT NOW!"
1,"Grow some balls, PLEASE!!!","This group is so WEAK I could puke! I am from the Montreal area like these guys, I am really truly embarassed by this band. Their material (I can't use words like art or songs because they don't apply) is so cookie cutter, radio pop, middle of the road friendly BS that I would not waste my time downloading it for free. message to the band: Grow up, I'm sure your all over 21... you have to admit it looks pretty stupid when a full grown adult sounds like an angry 13 year old trying to impress a girl or piss off ""mean old dad"", but I guess good money can make anyone do anything eh guys?There is some really good music out there these days people, AIM HIGHER! avoid this sh*t and go find it."
1,"""I think they lost their balls""","This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks! If you listen to it, stick your extremeities into a blender. NOW."
4,Pretty Good,"Sometimes this gets annoying but it's really awesome to just hang out to, the lyrics are a bit simple sometimes but still fun. You wouldn't want to listen to this for 4 hours straight but once in a while it's a good CD. Is it punk? I don't know but it's good and I hope that's what matters!"
3,ummm....,"""if you want punk go for something extreme like metallica""????since when is metallica punk? they are about as ""punk"" as simple plan. try not to be an idiot the next time you write a review.if youre one of those people that think music has to be hard to play for it to be fun to listen to, dont buy this cd. on the other hand, if youre one of those people that think music has to be fun to listen to for it to be fun to listen to, then you should probably buy this cd, its pretty catchy, although the singers voice can get irritating, and the lyrics are pretty stupid sometimes. overall its an ok cd, not great but not bad."
5,Simple Plan Rocks,"I've got the new CD ""Still not geting any"" and ""No pads no helmets just balls"" they are SOOOOO good. But I have to say that....the new CD is better. From the second album I put the songs I like are ""Addicted"" and ""Perfect"". The first one I like is ""Welcome to My Life"" and ""Perfect World"" It really touches me. Oh yeah Pierre is hott!"
1,Simply Bad Plan,"Attention morons: ""Punk"" is a sound, not how the band dresses. And these guys fail the definition on both counts.Also, ""Perfect"" is one of the lamest cliche dung-logs of a song I've EVER heard. EV-VER. Suck suck suck."
4,its ok..,1. I'd Do Anything - 10/102. The Worst Day Ever - 9.5/103. You Don't Mean Anything - 8/104. I'm Just A Kid - 9/105. When I'm With You - 10/106. Meet You There - 7.5/107. Addicted - 9/108. My Alien - 2/109. God Must Hate Me - 1/1010. I Won't Be There - 9/1011. One Day - 10/1012. Perfect - 10/1013. Grow Up - 4/10
2,Simple.,"Why only two stars?Because it's too simple for me. The guitar chords are basic, the lyricsare tiring, the singer's voice is whiney, and so on and so forth. However,I do find that there's more groups than just Simple Plan producing these types of records: New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, etc. And Ipersonally enjoy Simple Plan's album to the two groups mentionedpreviously. Why? Just because their album has catchier songs thatare just fun to listen to... but not all the time."
2,Why are they compared to Good Charlotte?,"They can't hold a candle to Good Charlotte. GC actually has some good guitar parts and SOLOS (yes you heard me). SP has none of that. They play slow power chords with sappy lyrics that are copied off of Blink and GC but are not sung with nearly as much emotion. At least Good Charlotte's lyrics are different, this bands lyrics aren't, its all boring love songs that we've heard a billion frickin times... I gave them 2 stars because I like a few songs but thats all. And you know what, all you people need to stop b****ing over whats ""punk"" and whats ""poser"". Good Charlotte have said themselves their not trying to be punk, so whats the use in arguing?"
1,WHEN WILL THIS END!!!!!!!!!,ALL OF THERE SONGS ARE ANNOYING AND THEY CANT PLAY.THERE JUST A GOOD CHARLOTTE COPY.THERE BOTH SELL OUTS.THE FANS ARE ALL GIRLS.DO YOURSELF A FAV. DONT BUY THIS CD.NOT WORTH 1 STAR
1,"simple plan, simply bad","what an awful, awful attempt at ""punk rock"" which is a genre that has been exploited and dissolved in the mainstream music biz a long time ago. if you have heard blink 182, good charlotte, or sum 41, you've heard this guys already. simple plan brings nothing new to the ""punk"" genre, they only make it more watered down and corporate than ever. the only reason you see other reviews on this page saying that they are good is because those people have not been exposed to true music, only what they can reach by mtv or the radio. here are bands that are better,louder, and more significant:the white stripesburning bridesthe donnassupergrass"
1,I'm sorry this CD is anything but perfect,"getting this cd, i was misled by addicted and i'd do anything, which are on the radio enough that you dont need to get this cd to hear your fill of them. the rest of the album is not even the punk-pop that is those two hit songs. it is solid, annoying pop that gets on your nerves. also, the song perfect bugs me caus it is the worst song on the whole album yet it always gets stuck in my head. these guys are dorks pretending to by punk, but they could get some lessons from greenday. from now on, their better off touring with pop hits like michelle branch and christina aguilera"
1,What is this junk?,"This has got to be the worst album EVER made next to a good charlotte or limpbizkit album! The singer sounds like someone kicked him in the nuts! For good music stick with bands like Machine Head, Nothingface, Opeth, Venom, Slayer, Soulfly, Cradle Of Filth, and the ultra heavy In Flames!Peace out!"
2,WOW....... crap,ok ill admit it i used to LOVE this cd....... but then i bought a NOFX cd and thats of course real punk.... I think that if ur a screaming 8 year old ull love this cd. but if ur not dont even waste ur money go and buy the distillers new cd.... now that deserves 5 stars!or buy anti flag just if u own this cd... quickly go and crush before it kills ur cd player. and if u actually like this cd.. OMG thats gross to even think about!
2,not all mainstrem punk bands are bad(but this one is),"this is not punk. Nor it is it rock.Nor is it even pop-punk.It is trashy coparte sellout pop rock. The 8 year old 'punks' will lap this up.If (why would you) you want to here more of this junk see avril lavange, good charlotte, brand new, new found glory etc.if you want to listen to some proper punk see sex pistols,the clash, rancid, dead kennedys the ramones etc.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. IT IS FOR 8 YEAR OLD POSERS BEING BRAINWASHED BY COPARATIONS INTO THINKING THEY UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THEY DON'T KNOW."
1,ummm....DONT BUY!!!,"simple plan is being declared the #1 rock band of this era. wow... what is this world turning into??? if they didnt try to have a rock image, with the umm...stud belts?? guitars(believe me, they dont know how to use them anyways)?? thats about as cheesy as it gets. they might be able to brainwash a bunch of 7 year olds to buy this stuff, but please, if you want to buy a cd to listen to actual music...dont buy this! the lyrics are just like the music, it sounds like its been written by a five year old like this line: 'I'm not gonna stop, you can't make me!' if you want pop, look somewhere else, if you want rock, definetly look somewhere else"
1,Nauseating whiny crap...,"There are no words I can think of right now to explain how bad this crap is. It belongs in a garbage disposal. They deserve to be shot in the head. I wouldn't take this CD home with me even if you paid me $20. Hell, it's so bad that I would rather listen to the f*ckin Backstreet Boys!!!Ok, enough ranting...I just wanted to give ANOTHER 1 star review towards the worst music ever to grace this planet."
1,THIS SUX SO BAD THEY MAKE BARBARA STREISAND LOOK GOOD,"HORRIBL IS ONE WORD THAT DESCRIBES THIS ALBUM AND THE BAND. THE WORST PART IS PEOPLE THINK IT IS PUNK WELL THEY CAN SHOVE THIS CD UP THEIR ASS AND BUY ""FULL CIRCLE"" BY PENNYWISE> DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GARBGE"
1,I'd do anything just to make u shut up!,Please shut up... u guys r a disgrace to canada! go away... please... french b@sterds
2,good but not real punk,"This CD is good but only for the pop-punk fans. I've listened to 1000's of bands just like Simple Plan that the pop-punk fans probly dont know about. You people writing reviews thinking NFG is real punk, need to pick up some Sex Pistols, Ramones, Black Flag, and Anti-Flag. If you really like Anti-Flag and their lyrics, then maybe you might like actual punk. This band is ok but there are THOUSANDS of bands just like them that you know-nothings have never heard of. Most people that listen to these big bands that use to be good before they sold out like Blink are probably ignorant preps or jocks. I knew Blink and liked them since Chershire Cat. I never woulda thought they'd turn out like they are now. If you want another same-old pop-punk band than buy this. have fun. haha."
1,i'd do anything!,"It is sad to see a talented band like simple plan being put to waste. They have corny voice and a very repeative tune. This album can get old really fast. There are only two amazing song on this album and they are i'd do anything and addicted.If i were you, i suggest download these two song, and don't even think of buying this album.Yes, simple plan is nowhere near as good as good charlotte. They don't have enough selection of song. Each one of their is all the same.I hope this help!By the way, selected yes if you like simple plan or no if you don't like simple plan."
2,Bubblegum Punk,"Simple Plan is exactly like Blink 182 just a little more childish. I would say their lyrics are good, but the way their music is and the way its sung isn't too great. To me, they sound like little kids singing. I give them two stars just for the lyrics, some are pretty good. Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying this CD. Too many bubblegum punk bands are coming out, and it needs to stop."
1,id give this -100 stars if possible,"this so called ""band"" just needs to quit, right now. but they won't cause they know that the people like those who gave this poor excuse of a cd (more like a drink coaster) will listen to them and give them the money which they don't deserve. simple plan, hmmm, well they do have one. that is to brainwash these idiots into believing their music is actually GOOD, and of course some people are actually stupid enough to believe such things. heartbreakerrrrr...oh dude shut the hell up, i so want to punch the lead singer in the face, its more like no pads, no helmet, and no balls. and their new cd is called ""still not getting any."" really, i wonder why, could it be because all of you in your little elementary school p***y pop band have no talent and are all complete flamers?Simple Plan stinks, no matter what anyone says."
1,Punk? yeah right,"Little preppy kids, this is NOT punk, this is pure pop with guitars. I can't stand this group, they sound like all the other pop bands out there like bad charlotte, sum 41, and blink 182. There is no orginality here, all the songs sound the same. these guys are as punk as NSTYNC. If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys, rancid, bad religon or sex pistols cd!"
1,B*** S***,"this cd is not only a disgrace to the whole music world in general, but also disgraces the darkended hell that is punk pop. My friend made me listen to this crap and all i want to know is... "" IS THERE ANY CREATIVITY WHATSOEVER?"" anyone with half a mind knows that love and loss songs are not hard to write because since everyone can identify with that everyone can also write about it. The guitars are horrible, i can play the drums and i don't drum, and i think I can sing better though i have the vocal equivalent to the guy from Mushroom Head which is also a shot in the ass. These guys are just another band that the girls listen to just because they think the guys are cute and the boys listen to just so they can get it on with the girls. OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE. if your gonna listen to this retarded genre at least listen to the origionals so you won't be as shallow and as much of a poser. do you people listen to music at all?"
4,"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls","Simple Plans CD No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls is a punk rock CD that is different and refreshing. Their tunes and lyrics get stuck in your head all day. But thats not a problem since the songs are great."
1,Simple Plan sound like nails on a chalkboard,"Yeah, i know their music is terrible but the thing that ticks me off about these guys the most is that people actually classify this as ""punk rock"". This is pop. These songs remind me of Backstreet Boys songs with guitars mixed in. Besides...songs like ""I'd Do Anything"" and ""Addicted"" are so annoying that i'd rather listen to the Macarena a million times.What was the point of this review? I don't know...I just thought that this album needed another 1-star review...it's that bad.For real punk check out: The Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, Black Flag, Angry Samoans, and The Descendents."
2,Just Balls?,"Just balls in what? A vice? The ""Perfect"" song comes out of my speakers, and I remember why XM or MP3 mixes are vital to my listening experience...I can shut all the crap out and listen to what I want. So I will avoid making personal attacks on this band. They have an audience...they fill a need. They may suck in my eyes (and many others) but I know a lot of people who find the Beatles archaic and Hendrix unexciting. I don't agree, but that's their, um, interesting opinion. I hate MTV now anyway (and have for about seven years), so as long as bands like Simple Plan get their videos played on TRL and at 4:00 in the morning or spun on the local ""music mix"" radio stations, I will hear very little of them anyway. If you like these kids, buy the album and help them through college in a few years when the novelty has worn thinner than the tepid lyrics and whiny voice on these songs."
2,No,"Why did these guys get popular? Their not nearly as good as other pop-punk acts out there, that have humor, meaning, emotion, and good, fast guitar riffs. Simple Plan does all those things mediocre at best. Okay, they have light humor in some songs, but not the kind that would make you burst out laughing like Blink-182. They touch on emotion in a way in Perfect, but the singers voice is so laughable that you cant take it seriously. If you want pop-punk with emotion try New Found Glory. They cant write good, varied songs either. All their songs are about love or them whining about something. If you want a band that writes about lots of topics and has some meaning, try Good Charlotte (their not nearly as bad as alot of people think). If you want pop-punk with quick guitar riffs and good solos, try Sum 41. Some songs on here are okay, but like I said, SP is just a mediocre version of all those bands I mentioned before."
3,Good at first but way too much POP to hold me for long,Simple Plan is not Blink 182. They are way too Pop to be called Blink. None of their tracks hard enough to please true punk rock fans. All of Simple Plans tracks kinda sound the same but that isn't always a bad thing. I think this album would apeal more to teenage girls who watch MTV all day than 18 guys who are looking for harder beats. It is a good album at first but the POP soon takes over and it makes put away the CD for good.
5,My kind of music,"How can you not love this CD? This will definitely be your kind of music if you love New Found Glory. Finally, another new band with an awesome sound!"
1,Here we go again!,"Ok, this is complete crap. There is no better way to describe it. So of course hundreds of little preteen girls are going to rave about how easy it is to identify with. It is only easy to identify with if you sit at home and whine about everything wrong in your life. The people who are obsessed with this album are the same people you see trying to dress hardcore and under the impression they're a rebellious outcast because they listen to a band who sings about what it wants for Christmas. Listen to Pennywise."
3,Good...But not great,"Simple Plan is good but is by no means great. This band is pure pop and nothing else. I'm 15 and unlike most teens my age I actully know what punk is (Ramones,Minor Threat,Sex Pistols, Black Flag ect.). Punk is no longer a lifestyle or the way you think, it's an image which most people have these days. The musicianship is good, but could use some MAJOR improvement. The lyrics are at times extreamly corny (my alien), and looks like they could be written by an elementry school student. I know this band is trying to give kids something to relate to, but they could do just that with much better lyrics then they already have. Peirre's voice is extreamly high, and he does get kind of annoying after awhile. However if you are looking for an album that's fun to listen to then I suggest Simple Plan. If you are looking for something more though provoking then turn elsewhere."
2,The person above said it best...,"Simple Plan is extremely poppy, predictable, talentless, generic, brainless, and whiny, but somehow they still rock. Honestly, I cannot figure out what it is about ""God Must Hate Me"" that makes me like it so much. I think 80% of the people bashing them just aren't open enough and think hating SP will be good for their image. Whatever, you can do that but your missing out on some good music."
1,"Just your ordinary pop-rock cd, nothing special","When I first heard Simple Plan's ""I'd Do Anything"", I seriously thought it was Sum 41. This band lacks in creativity and originality. The lyrics just plain .... As the cd goes on, the songs get worse and worse. I mean c'mon, an alien girlfriend? I can see they were trying to go for some creativity there, but it obviously backfired.I suggest not buying this cd unless you are a real fan of pop-rock bands such as Sum 41, Blink-182 and Good Charlotte..If you are looking for a more punk cd, I reccomend The Distillers, Anti-Flag, Finch and Thursday"
1,Good at first but way too much POP to hold me for long,Simple Plan is not Blink 182. They are way too Pop to be called Blink. None of their tracks hard enough to please true punk rock fans.

1,EW,"All I can say is...EW! the lyrics blow, the music lacks, the ideas of songs, i mean come on! i bought this cd and i so regret it...who writes a song about an alien girlfriend..im so mad they are on the radio now...disgusting! dont waste ur money please humor me"
1,crap,let's face it this is not punk it's pop like all of the other crap over mtv there are sum decent songs but emo/punk bands like my chemical romance and the used are way better
1,THIS IS COOL,"oh my god I love this band, they are so hot. I love they're punkish hairstyles and the way they dress. The music is awsome. IT's like the coolest cd I own besides Britney spears and good charlotte. The lyrics are like so deep, I almost cry. I'm a teenager too and I know how it feels when your parents yell at you and when you break up with your boyfriend and stuff.Damn my nail broke. Gotta go, American Idol is on. Simple Plan rocks!"
1,Yep,"They have a ""Simple Plan"" sure enough.... That plan is tosuck for the entire time they are in music. Too many oftoday's bands sound just alike. How can you tell thedifference between them? There are some exceptions... Butthis band isn't one of them!"
5,It Rocks!,An awesome punk album. It's not the poser trash people are sayin it is. It's real punk of today and I find it way better than the Sex Pistols. They had no talent. Buy this awesome CD NOW!!!
1,STay away from all pop/punk at all costs!,"Now i decided to review this rancid cd, i mean green day cd, o wait is it blink 182? no wait its good charlotte o no its simple plan its all the same though,lol Punk= pop end of story its all the same you want to hear some meaningful music go pick up KoRn's self tituled debut and you can hear Jonathan davis (vocals for KoRn) crying in the background or go buy marilyn manson's antichrist superstar and go listen to the man that you fear now thats real and its not fake! Another person reviewing this garbage said the lyrics were sad?!?!? sad?!??! no pathetic heres pretty much what you get when you listen to this crap o no i wrecked my daddys car boo hoo o no god hates me he lieks to pick on me and i wish i was dead cause lifes to terrible thats bull*hit!!!! but its another band for the preppy popular kids. so sad it really is. It really is."
1,Lame,These guys are the epitome of crap. The singer sings about heart break and stuff but you would never know because he sings like he is happy. He has no emotion even though it may be the worst day ever. Yeah every day is bad after listing to this junk.
1,Just a Thought,"Maybe this band should take it's own advice and ""Grow Up"". This album is absolute sunshine-powered pop drivel. Even fans of the pop-punk genre are advised to steeer clear of this piece of dung."
1,THEY SUCK,they are the worst emo-poser band ever. all the chords to every song are the same.. they JUST SUCK BALLS
3,Better Than Good Charlotte,"Little know fact: The singer and drummer were in an excellent pop-punk band called Reset. They were pretty good, I must admit. But this CD? Well, its ok. Whether you admit it or not, I'd Do Anything is a catchy tune. God Must Hate Me is definitely a relatable song as well. Perfect is atleast a rather refreshing meaningful emoish of song afloat in the meaningless anger of bands like Taking Back Sunday.If you buy this CD, you know what you're expecting. Pop hooks and lyrics that are directed at kids. I will say they are atleast much more talented than the majority of the crop of the recent pop plague.For those who probably wont buy this album, but are curious to the band, I reccommend God Must Hate Me, Worst Day Ever, Perfect and I Won't Be There.For kids into this stuff, its a 5-star CD. However, my interests lye in older stuff, so from me, it's a 3 star. But hey, like my title says, its better than GC."
1,"I HATE THIS CD, and the band","i like rock, but this cd sucks!!!!! it is the worst, waste of time on the internet looking it up and waste of money, so save yourself, DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
1,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,"Simple Plan is just another example of why since 2000 music has suck. they are just another pop punk band along with Good Chorlette, New Found Glory, and Lilexthat sounds JUST LIKE everything else blk 182 did 4 years ago.music today is like its was in the 80's no creativty, no originality,and no idenity. Just record companies puking out the same band over and over and over again. I first saw Simple Plan on T.V. and thought Blink knock offs and they would'nt last, but then I saw them on Nickoloden, NICKOLODEN, then on Disney and I got bored with them. But then when I saw them appearing in the Mary Kate&Ashely Olsen movie now I wish they were dead. Since the 90's ended music has sucked. MTV and the radio suck. You guys who are all 14,15,16 don't listen to this you want Punk listen to SUM-41, MINOR THREAT, BLACK FLAG, GREEN DAY, RAMONES, DEAD KENNEDYS, SEX PISTOLS,AFI, BAD BRAINS, AND THE CLASH. Even Offspring is better than is. Enough said."
5,Simple Plan! :),"I seen Simple Plan in concert when they were touring with Sugar Ray, and ever since then their songs were ringing in my head. I downloaded 'em all, and as soon as I could I bought the Cd. I've listened to it non-stop since. They're songs are upbeat, but have that punk egde which makes you start tapping your foot and bouncing. Plus, the songs are about topics you can relate to, like One Day where all everyone wants to do is grow up... and Worst Day Ever, well we all can relate. BUY IT!! :D"
5,"awsome guys, awsome songs","if you're looking for a great cd full of catchy songs, BUY THIS CD!! this cd is full of great song, love songs, break up songs, and just fun songs. these guys are awsome and you can catch them this summer as part of the vans warped tour. [....]"
4,"Great, but, unfortunately, wont be remembered. 4 1/2 stars","THis CD is great, but thanks to those critics it will be ""just another punk CD"". Two Weak Points: Some songs just blend together. 'Perfect...(except the CHORUS) Good Points: Trax 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Great Points: ""I'd Do Anything"" has no music solos, a short, great pop-punk(I use the term loosely) song. ""I'm Just A Kid"" wasa an obvious single. And the best song on the CD is ""I'll Meet You There""."
4,U gotta buy this CD,"I love Simple Plan sdince that very first day I saw them play at Edgefest and even b4 I was a big fan of Reset so I was real happy when I heard of SP I was counting the days 'til the release of no pads, no helmets... and it sure worths the wait. it's an awesome cd Love all the songs especially Addicted, Meet you there (made me cry..lol i'm such a dork!) and God must hate me so you really should get off your arse and go buy this CD"
1,I HATE simple plan,"I'm under 13 so I should like them.But you have to be under 13 and stupid to like them.Childish lyrics, bad music(did I just say music??), poser faces."
3,Can you get more pop/rock?,"To be honest, it makes me sick to see Blink-182 doing stuff with Simple Plan. See, Blink-182 is cool, and Simple Plan isn't. Blink-182 has deep lyrics (sometimes) and cool melodies. Simple Plan only got popular with all the MTV support, and they major in totally trashy lyrics with pop beats. Yes, pop but with electric guitars. Come on, would a real punk band go with Scooby Doo? I admit that #8 on this cd is a great song, but my point is that so many bands today are getting called ""punk"" when they're nowhere close. Someone really has to redefine punk."
5,"Awesome Band: awesome cd, awesome live","I saw Simple Plan play at Pop Disaster last weekend, and they kicked so much [booty]. They were so nice and talked to all of us fans before and after the shows. Their CD is high-paced, play it loud for an adrenaline rush. If you know Good Charlotte, Blink 182, or Ultimate Fakebook, then you'll know what I mean, and trust me this CD is a perfect example of this. They're just an emerging band, but please help them emerge, they're really amazing."
5,Totally Punk!,"Simple Plan's CD is so off the hook it is incredible. It is a great cd for teenagers! The song ""Perfect"" tells how every teenager feels that they are not good enough for their parents. Ever since i got the CD it is all i listen to and i never get sick of it. ""Just A Kid"" is an awesome song and it once again tells how teenagers feel. It is pure punk and pure awesome. ""I'd do Anything"" features Mark Hoppus which is totally cool! This CD rocks and i highly recommend it!"
5,hits home,"the songs on this cd are the anthems of teenagehood. no other lyrics can represent us this well. i live in their home town (montreal) and i never understood what all the hype was about. then one my friends passed me an earplug during french class and perfect came on. man did i look freaky! i was staring straight the teacher with glassy eyes and a huge smile. the song was just too amazing. the thing i like best about them is that they're new, so the band is still about the music and the fans. but once they start touring internationally in the fall.. *shakes head* hope they don't forget us homies!! wish them the best, they definitly deserve it."
1,Crapy!!!!,This cd is gay. The song refering to christmas sounds like a barneysong. It is entirely pointless and kidish. The songs are so goody goody. The singer sounds like he is 13.
1,What is the world coming to?,"Ok. Let me tell you something. I am not punk. I dont claim to be punk. but once this is for sure. This CD does not even come close to punk. These songs are aimed at kids? I'm 12 and I know a sellout when I see it. This band has nothing behind their corporate masks. You want punk? do NOT look to blink 182, sum 41, simple plan, good charlotte or NOFX to get it. if you want real punk with substance, look to The Stooges, Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag or, if your a moderner look to The Distillers or The Lot Six. These bands are real. Simple Plan has nothing. trust me. Unless your a kid whose selling yourself out big time, or an adult who already has, steer clear of this sh**t."
1,How simple is this plan?,"This plan must not be that easy to solve. First off the singer, very high voice... dont understand how you can even enjoy listening to this crap. Better music is all over at the metal scene. now where is the 0 star rating when u need it?"
5,"*Go Out And Buy ""No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls"" NOW!*",Hey! Everyone go out and buy Simple Plan's new album...it's awesome for any punk fan. Each and every song on it is great!
1,I wrote a poem on this band,"Simple PlanYou say your punkThat is bull $h!tYou sang ""I Don't Want To Think About You""Those Lyrics Connected To Me Cause That Is How I Feel About YouAll Who ANswer No To If This Review Is HelpfulCan Lick My....HandIf You Like ThemThen You Go To School Wearing Abercrombie and Spend Hundreds of Dollars Say Your Punk and The Only Ones That Agree With You Are Your Immature Poser FriendsSnoogans!Love,The JonesIf you agree your kick@$$!"
1,"Bland, unoriginal pop music.","I'm not exaggerating when I say that this CD is one of the worst I've heard this year. While their music is fine from a technical point, it's all very ... samey. It's like they took the same three chords and played them over and over again, just in a different order.Their lyrics are incredibly immature. They must be, what, early-mid 20s? Why on earth are they singing stupid songs about how much their parents hate them?If you're into Good Charlotte and the wave of faux-punk music that's sweeping the world, you'll love this. If you're into something a little more deeper, stay away and look elsewhere."
5,this is great,"The CD is just plain fun to listen to. Being a teen you can completely relate to most of the songs. ""My Alien"" is a really random song, but I love singing along with it. Not all of the songs are as deep as ""Meet You There"" or ""Perfect"", but then again I don't think that they're meant to be. They even took songs that could've been really sad and put it to an upbeat sound. Just like real life, you have your ups and your downs, and these songs demonstrate it so well. I love the way the band mixed pop and punk making a unique sound that a lot of people enjoy listening to. Sometimes I'm singing along and thinking, ""these lyrics just couldn't be more true"", and I bet a lot of you would say the same."
3,Its ok,"Ok now this cd may not be the greatest thing to hit the shelves but it just makes me sick seeing everyone giving it bad reviews stating what ""punk"" is and what its not. for all you ""hard-core punks"" out there im just saying dont force your opinions on others. yes you can say if the cd is good or not but dont just say crap about it when its not real ""punk"".this cd is pretty good. a few songs are nice and catchy while others are just ok. i recommend listening to some of the songs beofre purchasing this cd."
1,dont buy this,"simple plan are a band like anyother trying to make it big. but with the gay lyrics and crap vocals, they shouldnt even be a band..i definatly recomend this for ppl really into the whole POP punk, thing if you want it more like nsync.download id do anything, and youll be fine. nothing else on this cd is worth money!!"
1,this is NOT real music,"I admit that I was drawn to this band by their first single played repeatedly on the radio and my pops offered to buy the CD for me because he liked it too, and was probably hoping that he could borrow it from me some of the time. After hearing it for the first time, I just let him keep the fricking CD. I have never heard such a poor excuse for punk in my life. The worst part by far is how this CD has horrible, horrible, extremely childish lyrics. It's sickening to listen to, literally and physically sickening. An Alien girlfriend? Good God, please. That is by far the worst song on the CD. Nothing against the guys in Simple Plan, they're just another pop punk bnd trying to make it big, but this cd is truly awful. If you're totally into ""pop"" punk, then by all means get this CD because clearly you'll like it. If you are a devoted emo/punk fan who enjoys real music....then I guaruntee you will not enjoy this CD. Sorry guys, try again. Or maybe....don't."
1,Boy band!,"This may be the worst cd out there, what is really the difference between them and the backstreet boys or N'Sync. Both are willing to do anything to get on MTV and play the most commercial brand of Music. Both have legions of teenage girls who sing along to there lame music. They even both wear makeup! Take a look at the album cover, O' they are so cute! I guarentee that these guys where never into Punk Rock 3-4 years ago, and are just out for the cash!"
1,gayest band of them all......in fact........,"...there should be a picture of these guys inthe dictionaary next to GAY.....if i hear perfect or addicted on the radio one more time or if i hear my 11 year old sister sing them ever again i may jsut lose it and shoot up the place. Anyway, this band has nothing. their music has no depth no meaning, just a bunch of annoying pop hooks in order to cash in from the TRL crowd. There is no way these guys actually like the music they make or they may not have dicks. Bands like Simple PLan and rappers like chingy represent everything that is wrong w/ MTV and mainstream music these days. Anyone that thinks this band has musical talent obviously knows nothing about music and needs to expand their horizon."
1,*shudders*,"When I first heard this song, I couldn't remember if it was Sum 41 or Blink 182. Or could it have been New Found Glory? All American Rejects? How many of these artists are there? They all sound the SAME! There IS one difference, this guys voice is painfully BAD... like the lyrics. Simple Plan's name states it all there: They have a simple plan-- mix poor, simple lyrics with a whiney cute boy sterotype lead singer and you'll get your ... on MTV. That's exactly what worked for them. I can tolerate most poppy punk, in fact, I even fancy some of it. This is just bad. It's all a copy of what's already been done."
3,Sorry kiddies...,"I'm not here to bash on Simple Plan, but I must say their songs aren't that unique. I saw Simple Plan in concert a few weeks ago with Good Charlotte and Autopilot Off (which was a GREAT show by the way) and they sounded awesome live. I hadn't heard them before so after the show I bought their CD for (Money). After listening to the CD the whole way through, I hadn't really been ""moved"" or ""touched"" by any of the songs. They're catchy, but to me, most of them sound the same. The group as a whole hasn't really developed their own sound. They sound ""generic-ish."" (if that's even a word...) Hopefully in the future they can distinguish they're own ""sound"" but until then I think they need some maturing. Some good songs I recommend though are ""God Must Hate Me"", ""I'm Just A Kid"", ""My Alien."" If you really want the CD go ahead and buy it, but for me I just want my (Money) back."
4,Great album......but.,"so I'm a huge Simple Plan fan, so I got this cd since I'm such a big fan, and this album is a great start for the band, lyrically and musically its so good, but my copy of the cd only has 12 tracks.....why?? This album is supposed to have 13 tracks plus a hidden track. Mine didn't have Grow Up or My Christmas List on it which are both great songs, so why didn't my copy have them, I mean grow up basically made me a Simple Plan fan so I would of liked to have that on the album, other than that, It's great. Definitly pick up if your a pop punk fan"
1,I'd give it 0 stars if possible,"This is quite possibly the worst schlock passing itself off as emo I've ever heard. This isn't emo, this isn't punk, this isn't even rock music. This is what you get when you give the Backstreet Boys electric guitars and distortion pedals. This makes posuers like Green Day look like Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate or Sex Pistols. And trust me kids. That's saying A LOT."
5,Simple Plan Scores,"Before buying Simple Plan's debut CD, ""No Pads, No Helmets .. Just Balls"", I was quite skeptical. I figured they were just the same as any other band in the pop-punk category, and figured there was nothing different about them, but I was totally wrong.Anyone who picks up this CD can relate to at least one song off of it. From the fast-paced beginning track, ""I'd Do Anything"" to the slower song ""Perfect"", there will be lyrics that explain certain instances. Mostly broken-hearted songs, this CD also contains songs like ""Meet You There"", a song about the death of someone close, and ""Perfect"", a song that apologizes for not being able to live up to the way someone (in this sense, their fathers) wants you to. Also contianing ""I'm Just A Kid"", a song anyone who's ever felt left out can connect with.Pick up this CD, in my personal opinion, it's definitely worth every penny."
1,"No Talent, No Creativity, Just Bitching.","Don't even think of bowing down to Simple Plan. Like a regular wise-old grandfather would say: ""Ignore the hype. Don't read the positive reviews if you consider it not worth bought""."
1,It isn't the genre....,"Though Simple Plan isn't punk, its the fans that call them it and THEY are the dumbasses, anyways, the reason simple plan sucks is because they are talentless, posers, moneygrubbers, pointless, and above all canadian. Their lead singer whines too much and their music has no purpose or voice besides *insert high pitched whine* ""oh me oh my, my parents hate me, and god hates me, and I want your cash to help me overcome my pain,"" well folks don't give 'em a dime, let the little bastards suffer.P.S. BLAME CANADA!"
1,These Wussies Need Pads to Play Basketball,"Okay, I'll make this quick and to the point; this is awful. And for every poser Simple Plan fan who gives me a negative, I'll just write another 1-star review. You know why?Cause I'm a idiot.LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY"
5,Pop Punk..,"This is just another pop punk band.. But I like how the CD sounds.. Their lyrics are good and they have good voices w/ catchy songs. My favorite song on the album is ""Perfect"".. It's a great song w/ great lyrics.. But again, they sound similar to a lot of other bands.. But still I recommend buying the CD.. It's really good :)"
4,Punk-Pop,"I love this cd. It is great. I like to blast it and sing loud. Teens can relate to the lyrics. For the girls, these guys are hotties. I saw them live in concert and they rocked! My favorite song is 'One SlowDance' It's not on the album"
5,Simple Plan Rocks,"I was never into punk rock before I heard Simple Plan. Now I'm an all out punk rocker. Their album is incredible and basically tells the story of my life. I like it because I can relate to almost all of their songs and their sound is great. Not to mention their lead singer, Pierre, is so hot! I can't wait for them to come out with a new album. Everyone should own ""No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls"""
2,... horrible... buy it if you must,"what can i say,i got the cd because i loved ""i'm just a kid"". THE ONE FROM ""The New Kid"" SOUNDTRACK!!! this version is pathetic. i mean, if they go big, horray for them but lets just say i won't be cheering them on next time im in some podunk club downtown.get midtown or NFG if you want to enjoy some REAL punk music."
4,Ehh.,"It has some good songs. ""I'd Do Anything,"" ""I'm Just a Kid,"" ""God Must Hate Me,"" ""You Don't Mean Anything,"" etc. But NOT ""Addicted."" THAT SONG [IS BAD]. Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 appears on this CD (""I'd Do Anything."") and so does Joel Madden from Good Charlotte (""You Don't Mean Anything."") Pierre Bouvier is like...[an imitation Tom]... Anyways...Without these two guest appearances, the CD would be very weak!"
5,Awesome CD,"This is one of the best CDs I have ever bought. Most bands start off a little shaky with their first CD. Not Simple Plan. The best songs on the CD are ""God must hate me"" and ""Grow Up"". There are also other really good songs like ""I'd do anything"", ""I'm just a kid"" and ""One Day"". Overrall this CD rocks. I recommend it to anyone who like Pop-Punk music. Simple Plan rocks."
2,More pop than punk,"For anyone that is into the pop rock scene than this is a great cd for you. For anyone with any kind of taste in rock will steer away from this album. Songs like ""Perfect"" are so pop sounding that it makes me sick. Lyrics are unimaginative and sound almost boy bandish. Not a shred of decent rock in it."
5,Simple Plan is simply awesome,"I was told by a friend a few months ago to check these guys out, and now I can't stop listening. They have an awesome sound, and very deep lyrics. If you've got the time to check them out, do it, and you won't be dissappointed."
5,Great Cd,"Simple plan is one of the best bands i have heard, they combine mainstream alternative rock like Blink 182, and clash with a emo core sound such as New Found Glory"
1,Come on...where has musicianship gone?,"Seriously, Im tired of all these punk bands that cant play their instruments adn sit around playing the basic stuff you learn after owning a guitar for a month! and people eat this up! These guys cant even jam I bet, much less actually write a well thought out solo or instrumental piece. and that singer really needs to go through puberty and quit crying."
1,horrible,this is not punk it is pop its horrible dont buy it save your oney buy a rancid cd not this pop
3,just okay....,"I just didn't really get some of the songs on this album. Like the song ""My Alien"" I had no clue what they were talking about. There are some good songs, but they were all pretty much the same. You get bored with it. You could probably just listin to this on the internet and pick and choose which songs you like then go from there. Okay album."
3,"Aww, it's still okay!","I admit it lacks some originalty,so I am pinning that the sophomore cd is better. But the riffs are catchy and just teenage things that make people smile and hum along. My favorite tracks are: My Alien, God Must Hate Me, Addicted, and Meet You There. Oh! And to poke fun at Christmas, you should listen to the hidden track on 13. So cool..........this band could be better though."
3,meh,"I didn't care for this album because I'm a huge MxPx fan, and If you are like me, then you would know that Simple Plan is trying waaaay to hard to sound like MxPx. I don't like The lead singers voice. I don't reccomend this album, and ""Still Not Getting Any..."" is even worse. These guys aren't nothing but a sissy boy band with instuments!"
1,Well..,"Well, I have listened to parts of this album, it's not very good. I just wanted to review because I wanted to be cool and bash a band like the ""punk"" fans on here. I want to fit in too :("
3,its alright,"ill have to say that their r okay,but its not like there fantastic they live up to there name ""SIMPLE"" though they have there ""okay this a nice song"".i personllly dont have a favorite and i wish i had bought something else but for you guys just getting into ""punk rock"" you might as well give it a try???!!!!!though i recommend all of the good charlotte cds,rancid (any of there albums),sum 41,mest, all-american rejects and tons more ARE BETTER, so reallly its up too you i heard they were great and i thought not,its different for every one.so...................uh yeah."
1,This is punk?,"I can't see how you could call this punk at all? Why does it sound like Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Yellowcard, Green Day, and Blink-182 all have the same annoying nasily voiced loser singing about some piece crap? Addicted is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. All these bands are sellouts, who appeal to the masses. If you want something that doesnt suck check out Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse, Muse, Wilco, Interpol, and of coarse Radiohead."
1,I have been forced to hear this garbage at work.,"This dreck has no redeeming qualities at all. The entire ""pop-punk"" genre is horribly flawed, a prime example of the depths to which mass culture can sink. This is the worst of the worst, and I truly believe that the world would be a better place without Simple Plan and everything they represent."
1,"Sad, Whiny, immature","This is by far one of the worst CDs I've ever heard. Not because of the music, but because of the lyrics. You can tell off the bat by the song titles how immature this band is, along with their music and song.This entire CD is nothing but a pity-fest, whining about how they dont wanna grow up, or that they're living ""the worst day ever.""IF you want immature snobby music, then this is the stuff for you, but if you want real, good quality music that takes talent to write and play, look somewhere else."
2,I just don't get it...,"I don't understand why this cd got such great reviews. I'm not trying to bash Simple Plan, I don't even have the cd, but it seems very unoriginal and more pop than punk. They sound way too much like Blink-182 only even more immature. How old are the band members anyway?"
1,Possibly the worst CD ever made,"No originality. No talent. Poorly crafted songs. If you are above the age of 13 and/or have actual knowledge of REAL music, I highly recommend you overlook this album. The sad thing is that these talentless posers fly the punk rock flag, doing nothing but tarnishing the hard-earned reputations of such great bands as the Descendents and the Dead Kennedys. If you buy this album and think you're punk rock, you either need a dictionary or a smack in the face. It's bands like these that make me thank God I am not into the radio-friendly garbage most record labels are throwing in our faces these days."
3,Nothing New,"Simple Plan is a cute, poppy-punk group who sound like they're having WAY too much fun to be exclaiming that ""life is a nighmare"" and ""god must hate me"". But you can't deny that the tunes are catchy. Even though I usually listen to more hardcore stuff (Nirvana, AFI, The Distillers, Smashing Pumpkins), it's sometimes its nice to get a break and listen to some more pop-ish stuff. Pierre's voice can be slightly whiny at times, but is generally tolerable, and although Simple Plan's songs about girls and tennage drama aren't exactly mature and their material, lyrically and musically, is nothing new, they are still a fairly good band who deserve some cred. I mean...hey...they may be way recycled, but at least they sound like they're having fun doing it."
5,SIMPLE PLAN: a awesome CD,"This is one of my favorite cd's, it't the perfect combination of pop/punk melodys.......it has some Nice songs then the bad boy ones are off the hook....go out and get this cd.....it's a great investment."
1,Coin Flip,"Listening to this band it always makes me wonder which poser band is more gay. Simple Plan, or Good Charlotte. It's a very heated race. SP's singer sounds like he's in a boy band, the song topics are all aimed for pre-teen girls. What really annoys me is the token bald guy in the band. Does anyone care about him? I for one don't. That is why you are being ripped off if you buy this crap."
1,"Awful, just awful","So this is what has happened to music huh? I feel sorry for all of you kiddies growing up these days. The music that MTV and radio plays these days is complete and utter garbage!! Thank god i was born in the early 80's and grew up with the AMAZING music of the early 90's. With REAL bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, The Pixies, Alice in Chains, Sonic Youth, Metallica dominating the musical landscape. These day's it's just phony tripe. No creativity or originality invloved. If you want to get enlightened just listen to the bands i listed. They will send you off to a world that is a far cry from the sewage that pollutes the airwaves these days."
5,Simple Plan,"If you have ""NO PADS, NO HELMETS...JUST BALLS"", you gotta check out this band. This CD is a must for all ""Punk Rock"" fans. If you are a Blink 182 Fan, you'll love these guys. Their music gives you a whole new insight on life. They are sure to go to the top. Mark Hoppus, from Blink 182, is even a back up vocal in one of the songs(""I'd Do Anything""). If you want to hear a great band, pick up this CD.They ARE NOT one of those ""One hit wonders."" The whole CD is worth it. Check it out for yourself, you won't regret it. I sure didn't. My first time seeing them even hearing them was on Saturday(6-15-02) at a concert. They were so great, after they performed I had to go to their booth and buy the CD and a t-shirt. I even met them, they are great guys too. Pick up the CD... You'll love it. ..."
4,I'M HUNGRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS NOT PUNK!!! however, what i've heard of this cd is totally great!! It is lyrically total teeny bopper, but the music is more like teenage totally unnhardcore rock. it is annoying when people call them punk, cuz they're not, but they're still really really good"
3,Pretty generic. Still has its moments.,"Simple Plan brings absolutely nothing new, musically or lyrically, to the pop-punk scene as we know it, flat out. That said, this release still has its moments and the band is young and energetic. That in itself shows some promise. The songs deal with the average teenager's life: girls, high school, and problems with parents. Pretty cliche stuff. However, if you are still interested to see what these fellas can dish out, and you have some extra money laying around; go pick it up. There are some worthy tracks with pretty good repeat value on ""No Pads, No Helmets...."" They're worth a try."
1,Maturity: get some,"This group may say they are a punk band, but nothing is further from the truth. They are nothing but a few kids who realized they could make money if they imitated the early years of Blink-182 and the overly-commercial Good Char. While the Goods have not stopped torturing me with their prepackaged sound, why should I have to listen to another sound-alike 'punk' group who probably did just fine in social circles. faux-outsiders like Simple Plan are taking Punk Rock, the interesting bastard-child of rock, to a new, juvenile, lower level. In their last two CDs, blink-182 has changed from childish ideas on sex to sadness and more adult themes. 'Miss You' is the cry for punk to grow up. Any CD titled 'just balls' deserves to be put on the back shelf. While other true punk bands have grown, Simple Plan and all the others like it insist on dragging it back down."
3,ehhhh,"haha yes this band is not original, not that great and just sell outs. But i own this album because A. it wuz on sale and B. i like a few songs on here. This album is just a whole bunch of generic pop ""punk"" and i'm sure if you are in middle school or high school, you justt might like it. However, this album is not as bad as its evil twin WAKEFIELD. since i gave them a 2, i'm giving simple plan a 3."
3,good...before addicted came out,"When I first bought this cd, the only singles were ""Im just a kid"" and ""I do anything"". I loved those songs, then when addicted came out, I liked it at first, then it got annoying when they kept playing it over and over again, on mtv,radio, and stuff, then it was just plain crap. ""perfect"" now is good cause everyone can relate but addicted got annoying. Only get this cd if its less than 3 bucks and new, but don't pay the price at the store. Its not worth it damn it!!"
3,You will need a helmet for this one,"this cd....well maybe should get 4 stars for thos eof the avid listeners of wanna be punk rock but just ends up to be pop punk..i mean come on...its soo obviously pop with the guitar strings in the background...without the ""look"" of simple plan, i would mistake them for another one of those boy band, BSB thing.so if you're looking for true punk rock, maybe you should try good charlotte's 2ND CD. not 1st BUT SECOND.don't try this cdbut if you're looking for britney spears' friends in the music business sound...cope this cd.."
5,Simple Plan is simply the best.,MY boyfriend went to the see the Pop Disaster tour and when he came back she said that the opening act was just as great as the show itself... SIMPLE PLAN! They'll be in a few warp tour shows so check them out there. I know I will. Great CD!
1,ahhh,"no simple plan god doesnt hate you he hastes us for creating you and your horrible band. god even fans of pop punk (good charlotte, nfg, sum 41, etc) think you are big whiney losers. my god you are like 25 and stating your just a kid. hello time lapse! oh and they are not even original enough to create their own song ideas. christ how many more bands are gonna piss and moan cause there daddy didnt like them being in a band? HEY EVERYONE LETS ALL CRY FOR SIMPLE PLAN, THE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR MEDIA CREATED LOSERS CAUSE THERE DADDY DOESNT SUPPORT THEIR BAND! awe poor you do you need a shoulder to cry on? they just want to be one of those bands who pull the ""i had such a hard life growing up cause i got grounded"" image and its crap. wanna pity anyone for having a hard life, listen to good charlotte emotionless. thats real, not a ""oh pity me!"" song. i never thought i would say this, but PUT NSYNC BACK ON TV. at least they dance better"
3,Well,"This CD is pretty good, buy its a borrow b4 u buy CD. this band seems to only be good for funny lyrics, though they arent very talented, this gets a 2.8, cuz thats all it really diserves"
2,Nothing New,"Simple Plan is every other pop-punk band out there. They are not original or new, sounding the same as Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and Wakefield. The music is likeable, but it never reaches to an original or different style. With about eight gutiar chords and three drum beats, they try to create songs with depth or originality like ""Perfect"" or ""I'm Just a Kid,"" but it's obvioius that they are manufucatered to cater to what's popular with music now. Although some of the music is enjoyable, the lead singer's voice becomes whiny, the music exactly the same and the lyrics are predictible. Obviously, Simple Plan attempts to become the new punk band, while coming out with music that is just like everyone else's."
1,The song titles tell us alot about the band.,"4. I'm Just A KidYes you are. Go back to school and learn how to play music.10. I Won't Be There11. One DayAnd a happy day it will be.13. Grow UpTake your own advice. Grow up, play music, make art, and stop hurting my ears.*cries because 1 star is the lowest*"
1,WHAT A JOKE,"I don't want to degrade my generation or anything but this music is as much this generation as high school guys wearing girls capri pants. When i was in high school it was pennywise, blindside, fat and epitath not high pitched pop punk. where are the good old days?"
1,0 STARS FOR SURE but i couldn't do that,im not even going to say anything because it would result in tears.NOT MY TEARS ETHER
2,Pretty Junky...,"Good guys, bad band. Four words that describe this Canadian band perfectly. Let's face it, their music is terrible. Only whiny tenagers would enjoy this garbage. However, I admit that thee guys are hilarious and they did try very hard so for that they deserve a two. If you want good Canadian talent, try Sum 41.WHY YOU SHOULD BUY IT-You feel sorry for them.-You truly LIKE this garbage.WHY YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF-You hate poppy pop punk and have somewhat good taste."
1,Killing Rock and Roll,"Many analogies fly, comparing Simple Plan to actual musicians. Bands like this, although obviously imitating better bands like Green Day, shouldn't be mentioned in the same sentence let alone ""compared"". Every time the music making department at Atlantic releases something like this, they may sell oodles of records, but they kill music a little more. I agree with that other guy. Go buy Nevermind. Music is an art, not a product. But that's just my opinion."
1,Listening proof that rock and roll is dying,"Terrible. Utter garbage. Rock is dying. It's pathetic, talentless, high pitched people like this that are kicking rock to a pulp, without letting it up. If you want to kill music, buy this album. These guys HAVE no balls, so it's no wonder why they don't need pads and helmets. Every single song is the same, each one is as predictable as the last. Do your ears a favor and do not purchase this waste of paper and plastic."
1,"no pads, no helmets........just [bad]!","(i am actually 14 yrs old)My friend has this cd, and I asked her if I could borrow it. Worst thing I ever did. The singer is really whiney. I could see why he was an unpopular person..."
1,I HATE WANNABES!!!!!,"i absulootly h@ wanabes they make me sick! ppl think their punk if they buy th@ sh*t from hottopic and listen to simple plan and other sh*t! it's the same evrywhere, they listen 2 avril lavigne and call themselvs sk8er bois, or they dress in black and call themselvs gothic! labels r 4 soup cans, and only some1 w/out a personality would just follow the crowd and buy whats popular! i also h8 whiners and preps, there r so many people whining about how terrible their life is and so on, we don't need to hear a grown man whining about their life, and pretending 2 b teenagers! hotopic just supports all those people buying th@ cheesy sh*t, so while im complaning about simple plan and all th@ sh*t might as well tell the world what i think about hotopic!!!"
3,"No pads, no helmets...no talent?","Not trying to bash this genre, but Blink-182, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, etc, sound exactly the same. They are all 'pop-punk' trying their hardest to be hardcore. The catchy music and pathetic lyrics in this album will get stuck in your head, and before you know it, you'll be singing along to the music..but please, don't let too many people know you're listening to Simple Plan. I suggest you burn this CD from your little sister and only play it if you're sure no one's around, but if you want to listen to REAL punk, I suggest some Blanks 77 or The New York Dolls."
5,wow,"simple plan is amazing, and this cd is awesome. they put on THE BEST live show. i suggest everyone go and check it out. each song on the cd means a little something different, and the way the fast and slow songs are mixed just make the cd great. if you like the starting line, NFG, good charlotte, or yellowcard, then this cd is right up your alley. other cds i suggest are story of the year, acceptance, matchbook romance, maxeen, and spitalfield. therye all a little different, but most people that like simple plan also tend to like those bands, even though theyre a bit underground still, except story of the year."
5,upbeat punk?alternative? or just good clean fun?,"I absolutely love this cd. I saw them in concert 2 years ago and decided that they were pretty good. Then ""Addicted"" came out and I've been hooked ever since. I bought the album and didn't know what to expect. I thought they would be something between Blink182 and Greenday. I was right. They're Blink 182 without the vulgarities. It's fun (My Alien) and some of the lyrics are really insightful (Perfect)If you like music that keeps your head nodding with the music, this is the right cd for you."
4,"Well Done, Boys!","Overall, a great CD. It has the perfect blend of fun, upbeat songs like ""I'd Do Anything"" and slower, more lyrically-focused songs such as ""Perfect."" It's a great debut album, and quite worth your money."
4,This Cd Is Great,"This cd is great. It has some good points and a couple bad points.1. I'd Do Anything: 8/10: Good song, but gets repetitive.2. Worst Day Ever: 8/10: Good song, catchy lyrics3. You Don't mean Anything: 8/10: This song is a great song4. I'm Just A Kid: 9/10: This is the song that got me hooked5. When I'm With You: 10/10: Has an extremely catchy riff6. Meet You There: 7/10: Good slow song or to sing to your girlfriend7. Addicted: 10/10: Favorite song on the cd, catchy lyrics8. My Alien: 8/10: Funny song, and great riffs9. God Must Hate Me: 8/10: Funny lyrics10. I Won't Be There: 8/10: Great opening solo, and the bass is awesome.11. One Day: 6/10: Acoustic for most of the song12. Perfect: 10/10: Awesome song13. Grow Up: 7/10: Ok Song"
4,good but no Good Charlotte,I like Simple Plan they have some good songs but for some reason my ex loved Simple Plan and hated GC. GC is so much better ok ok GC is kind of a punk boy band now but look at Simple Plan they look like a bunch of 12 years olds. Image isn't everything though and like GC they have some great songs. That song Addicted is real good it was also the reason I broke up with my ex if a girl sings that to you and says she is addicted to you after the song think about it before you dump her I made a mistake on that one so learn from my mistake
2,Please do not compare to GC or blink...,"This is pure pop, unlike Blink-182 or Good Charlotte (who are pop-rock). I mean just look at Simple Plan; their everywhere a pop band would be- in Snickers contests, playing concerts in Disneyworld, lending songs to Disney soundtracks and little kids movies, appearing in a Mary Kate & Ashley movie, I mean come on. The songs are poorly written and their always about either A. not wanting to grow up or B. girls. Guitar? Fugghataboutit! Theres only one solo/break on this album and its in Addicted. The drums are okay, but the bass is pretty bad I can barely hear it. Yeah they are fun to listen to, and there are definetly much worse bands out there, but they just seem to generic and they seem like their riding off the success of other bands."
1,Repeat of crappy music.,"As far as I'm concerned, these guys are just like Good Charlotte. Completely untalented. I've heard this before. Their songs get old fast. Perfect annoys me. It's just a bunch of whining. I'm Just A Kid is more of the same. God, no more of this."
3,Catchy Tunes and Upbeat Driven Guitars,"I disagree with people who try to classify punk and contain it as what they had when they were growing up or whenever ""it was real."" Simple Plan's CD is at exciting, energetic, and just a feel-good youthful experience that doesn't follow any guidelines. Just because a bunch of bands sound similar (which is why i gave it a 3 and not a 4), doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong. At least they're music isn't dismal or depressing. Honestly I think bands like soundgarden and stp are ...boring, cuz all theyre songs sound the same too, except they make me wanna crawl up in a corner and [hide]. Smashing pumkins is weird ... and never would I say that I don't like Nirvana, but how many times can you listen to someone scream ""Rape Me"" over and over again. It's a good sign that these so called ""pop-punk bands"", filled with people who don't hate their lives (What a Concept!), are growing in popularity. Good CD, go buy it."
1,from an unbiased source,"ok...i am not going to call these guys ""not punk"" or whatever, because personally, all that noise from bad religion, rancid, ramones...just sucks to me.i will say, however, that i would take those bands any day over these whiny little kids. what IS this world coming to? when i see music videos like this with the teeny-bopper band jumping up and down on the roof it makes me want to throw up. this is just pure garbage...no musical talent, no lyrical talent. ugh. at least bad religion, rancid, and the ramones could WRITE and PLAY music!"
4,Here's Why:,"This c.d. is really good just some of the words aren't poetic.But, anyway,this is a good c.d. and all of you avril haters will love it. My personal favorites are:1.I'd do anything2.I'm just a kid3.addicted4.perfect.If you like the following bands you would probably like Simple Plan:1.Good Charlotte(good charlotte is a little more hardcore though)2.Blink-182 (a little more parental advisory if you know what I mean)3.Sum-41 (More hardcore)"
1,this sux balls...ya!,"this is the worse stuff i have ever heard as i can see i refer to it is stuff not ""music"" thus because it is not ""music"". please if you like this stuff, go kill yourself.Plz send me hate mail bitchs: cradleoffilth77@aol.com"
1,Its sad but it makes sense,"It's sad to see kids listen to this crap not knowing about great rock bands like Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Pearl Jam, The Beatles, and Metallica. But I can understand why, MTV forces these bands into their shows and little middle schoolers see it and think its cool and listen to it and love it. Its not their fault they listen to this junk, I listened to Blink 182 Enema of the State and actually thought it was one of the greatest CDs of all time. Yeah ill admit this kind of music is catchy but if you really heard other bands that could rock then this starts to sound terrible. Im not bashing Simple Plan because they sound good enough to be popular but I'm just saying theres music that makes this seem like total crap."
1,How can these guys stand to hear themselves play?,"I'm actually surprsed that they would call themselves Simple Plan, it seems like their main goal is to seem more complex than they really are. Unfortunately they suck at life and we get this. It truly seems like these guys turned on the radio one day and thought they could achieve sucess by imitating the pop-punk already choking the airwaves. They started with some emo, then added way too many pop hooks, thus taking away the emotional aspect of the emo, as well as the ""punk"" aspect they were going for. They had screwed things up enough at this point and released their poorly titled album. Thus, Simple Plan was born."
4,Great Pick-Me-Up,"I'll admit, I was hesitant when my friend loaned me her copy of ""No Helmet, No Pads... Just Balls."" Being a fan of The Ramones, Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd and other more time-tested bands, Simple Plan just really didn't fit in anywhere.When I heard the first strings of ""I'd Do Anything,"" though, I was ready to just get up and dance. The music was upbeat and, no matter how depressing the lyrics were, it just made me want to dance.""No Hemet, No Pads... Just Balls"" is now one of my favourite cds. It's a cd I can listen to all the way through without having to skip one single track. I'd recommend this cd to all of my friends in a heartbeat."
3,Not what I expected,"Some of the songs (read, the singles, and a couple others) rock, but the others are slightly disappointing and it's tough to stick out the full cd without getting bored"
1,PUNK!?!? YEAH RIGHT!!!,"To start off, the only reason I purchased this cd was because the song I'm Just A Kid was on the new guy soundtrack and i love that movie. So i thought that i'd try this cd out just to give them a try. That was a BIG mistake. These guys consider themselves punk!?!? IN THEIR DREAMS. The singer, Pierre, sounds like he hasn't gone throught puberty!!! So overall I think I like the cover more than anything else on this cd!"
5,Sad lyrics with happy music... oddly nice.,"Almost every single one of SP's songs are terribly depressing.It's obvious that lead singer Pierre has some issues with his family. The utterly depressing, tearjerking 'Perfect' is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. But the rest of the CD blares out happy-go-lucky guitar riffs, juvenile lyrics, and just plain fun. I've had the pleasure of meeting these talented guys, and that is really what they're all about. This is a great easy listening CD - it may not be earth-shaking or momentous, but it is just good clean fun. Favorites include 'My Alien', which is just a funny song about a rather odd girlfriend, 'God Must Hate Me', which I'm sure is something we all can relate to (luckily He doesn't!), and 'I'd Do Anything'. Pierre's vocals go nicely with the whiney pop-punk music of Seb, David, Jeff, and Chuck. These guys are great - see them in concert, they're even better."
3,simple rules for a simple band,"i'll do anything features mark hoppus from blink 182 as guest vocals in the video as well as in the cd,i'm just a kid, is featured on a new guy the movie soundtrack, as well as this cd,addicted is their third song released from the no pads, no helment just balls cd"
5,SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS,"This cd is amazing. Simple plan is a very talented group of musicians from MONTREAL, CANADA!... buy this album. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!..."
5,Simple Plan rocks like it's nobodies business!,"This cd is great for all those fans out there who like anything from Blink-182 to Sugar Ray. They combine teenage angst with a great beat. The cd is definetly worth at least a listen to. It goes from punk rocking hard in songs like ""I'm Just A Kid"" and ""I'd Do Anything"" to a lighter sound (and my two faves)in ""One Day"" and ""Perfect"". Give this cd a listen to and check out their web site (...). These guys rock and one of my newest favorites since they played here @ my university!"
1,CRAP carp and crap,"Simple PLan has managed to be the most bubble gum pop ever why because once bubble gum looses its flavor it tastes like crap and that whats going to happen to this band they will loose the flavor eventually and fade away and be bums....They should learn to get fans that know how to wipe there own ass if you like so called ""pop punk"" and you like 12yr old boys and girls and like A cup boobies then by all means by this album ok buh-- bye"
1,You know music is dead when a band like this comes out,"Awful. Terrible. Preppy. Not punk, not rock. Hey, these guys don't even deserve to be called pop. It's that bad. Every single person that says this is the ""greatest band ever"" has obviously never heard Nirvana, The Beatles or the Foo Fighters. Every single song sounds just like the one before it and is terrible. Do not buy this album! You are only fueling the mainstream pop monster! We must destroy it before it takes over! Do yourself, and music, a favor and buy Nevermind by Nirvana, any Beatles album, or any Foo Fighters album. But do not buy this trash. There is only one thing an album like this is good for. FIRE STARTER!!"
2,Only you can save yourself from this piece of ....,"2 Stars if i hate it this much?Well the reason being that ""Perfect is a good song.But the rest is very deluded and dull.Angst is better left to people who can actually sing like Avril.I'm sick of these punk-prodigys to Green Day.Blink is alright but the rest are hopelessly s...Don't fall for this useless garbage."
1,im so punk,"SIMPLE PLAN AND GOOD CHARLETTE BRING THE MOSHxTHEY ARE THE ROCK!BUY THIS CD!! NO PADS, NO HELMETS, JUST BALLS. TEEHEEEHEEEHEEEHE ROCK MOSH DEATH MOSHIM SO PUNK!"
2,Simple Plan....Waste of Your Money,"I like a lot of music...rap, punk etc. I heard the song addicted and thought it was okay..then my cousin bought me this cd. At first I thought it would be ok... but after listening to it all...ugh! The songs are all pretty much the same...11 and 12 year-old girls will be the only ones liking this cd. The only song worth this album is God must hate me..and even that is not too good either. If u really like one song don't get the cd! burn it. So, Simple Plan is a waste of money except for 1 ok song."
1,Worst...band...ever,"Every time I hear simple plan it makes me want to vomit. They have to be the worst band ever. Their songs are stupid and sound just like every other pop-punk band. Not original at all. Overall this album is a -100,000. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!"
1,i haven't even listened to this cd,"...but come on. Just look at the cover and the title, and remember that horrendous song MTV and the radio would play, the one that goes ""I'm Just A Kiiiiddddd"". Now laugh hysterically like I'm doing right now."
1,Don't buy this crap,This album sucks. All it is people bitchin and moaning about their girlfreinds. Anyone who calls this album punk is an idoit. I'm tired of hearing punk-pop posers on the damen radio and mtv.
3,Ill be nice... this should only get 2 and a half!!!,"Whoah... this is Simple Plan's first album and i got the impression that they didnt know what to sing about!!!Green Day is WAY better Perfect and I won't be there are pretty well the only good songs on this album... oh i forgot so is I'm just a kid. But really... they have a lot to complain about it seems to me... Still Not Getting any is way better... this whole CD is whining... some of it is pleasurable whining, but most of it is annoying....Well, what can i sayDo you have the time to listen to me whine? Well maybe for Green Day, but not for SP!"
2,redundance......,"if a person puts this CD on and listens to it while playing pool or something along those lines, he will hardly notice a change from song to song. the songs sound too much the same from one to the next. blame that on lack of musical talent - the band cant play anything else. i guess thats about all that should be expected from a first release, but dont buy it. download 2 or 3 songs and it might as well be the whole CD."
4,A Comprehensive Collection,"Over the years cookbooks have evolved from mere collections of recipes to works of art replete with photographs and the colorful ramblings of the authors. This book harkens back to the former. It is a comprehensive collection of pie recipes, nothing more, nothing less. There are neither photos nor charming anecdotes nor historical notes.The collection of recipes is extensive and the ones I've tried (pineapple meringue, lemon grand meringue and a number of the angel pies) have been satisfactory. However, the instructions are skimpy and an inexperienced baker might find this less than acceptable.If you are tired of the chitchat and art and want recipes plain and simple, this is the book for you. However, if you have been spoiled by the luxurious tomes with their lush photographs and detailed directions, you will probably be disappointed by this offering."
4,A good way to make the dream come true!,"If you're interested in learning how to build a PC, this book gives you a good over view and plans to build one. The book gives good details. Maximum PC is a good source of information about PC's, how they work, and how to build them. If you use their books and New Eggs YouTube series, you can build some nice PC's."
5,Like taking a comprehensive intro business course,"This book is invaluable. I would go so far as to say that it is a good business class for anyone, not just horse people. The book is not edited very well, but you hardly notice because it is presented in an honest and direct way. I really recomend it for those who want to be able to make a living in the horse world. Its tools for writing a horse business plan are non-threatening and easy to understand. This book helps you focus your energy and money in the most effective ways you can to grow your business. It has everything from how to do simple market analysis, to making marketing materials to how to set business goals you can achieve and feel good about. For those who are dedicated to making a living with horses, I highly recomend this book (especially since the horse world is a very tough one in which to succeed."
2,Basic Marketing Lessons,Book covers basic marketing lessons that can be fit to use in any business. Some sections go as far to tell the reader that they must pay taxes and have a business plan. This book is not for anyone with a basic understanding of a business. There are far too many spelling and grammer errors.
2,Factual errors abound,This book has more than its fair share of factual errors. Double check anything you read in it.
4,A very good summary of system administration.,I found this book to be very practical. It does not cover every single topic in detail so if you are looking for a detailed reference check the man pages. But if you have not had a lot of experience administrating Linux or a network this book is great. By the time you are finished you will have a secure Linux box with a minimum of hassle. I love the book.
2,a mystery reader,"Clay Dancers has a good mystery which I did not guess, two suspenseful chases, and an interesting ending. However, I was often confused by what was happening, when it was happening and who was involved. There were too many characters. It also seemed as if the author were trying, unsuccessfully, to imitate the book Falling Woman by Pat Murphy--a lonely, eccentric female archaeologist, on a quest, spirits from the past, people being killed. Dawkins attempted to develop some interesting characters (especially Hooper John). However, the book is billed as a mystery and as a mystery it was hard to follow."
3,I guess I should be fair,"I'm way too old for this, but it seemed like a good background filler at the time. Stories are short and direct, with good morals. Probably great for the target audience, but I did get a bit bored after a while. I do love stop-action animation, though, and this filled that bill."
5,A fine pick for any young viewer who can't get enough of Bob,"Bob the Builder's indomitable can-do attitude has inspired countless young viewers. ""The Best of Bob the Builder"" is a compilation of some of the best adventures of Bob and his machines, which serve as both his tools and his best friends. With bonus features of never before seen stories, and DVD games, ""The Best of Bob the Builder"" is a fine pick for any young viewer who can't get enough of Bob."
5,Great for new or old Bob fans!,"Aidan has not seen too Bob the Builder and this DVD really was a great introduction to some Bob favorites. He really enjoyed watching Bob and his friends build and work together and he get's really excited when he hears ""Can we build it?"" I thought the DVD was adorable and I especially love that it is 140 minutes of Bob-filled fun! I don't even think we have made it through the whole DVD yet as Aidan always want to start from the beginning! This DVD is also an exceptional value of about $15! I think it would be great for both new and old Bob lovers!"
2,Yikes,This has very little educational value for kids. It has minimal plot but decent claymation. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone.
1,"this video was ordered by my little girl by mistake & no way to ""undo"" from anywhere!","it is very unfortunate that there is NO way to simply disallow or calncel this order, and this is the third time a ""digital"" video is being purchased by a little kid by simply clicking a button. If you - Amazon - can have a way to report or stop this, please contact me - the parent!"
4,Bob is good...,My son loves this series. He definitely liked this episode. I felt that the picture quality was not very good.
5,Well Constructed,"I originally was looking at the ""Teeter Hang-up"" brand, but noticed the appearance similarity between it (the 5000 model) and the Calm system for only half the price. The Calm reviews were favorable so I decided to order it (from Target - free shipping) and I am glad I did.The sturdiness of the machine was my primary concern and the Calm model is surprising high quality in materials and workmanship, especially considering the big price difference.As I write this, I notice that Amazon is no longer offering it from Target. But I bought mine direct from Target Online to get the free shipping. Amazon wanted about $15 S&H.; Sales tax was less than that, and the base price was otherwise the same."
2,Dont Do It!,I purchased this item just over a year ago and one of the pivot arms is starting to bend. I called the manufacturer and they told me not only was it out of warranty but that they dont make the arm any more so I am basically SOL. By the way I only weigh 180 lbs. Well under their weight specs.
3,wish i had the room to keep it up all the time to actually use it,very cool product but takes up sooo much room! i had it down in my basement but had to take it apart to store it because its just sooo big i didnt have room for it. if i had the room and it was up all the time i would probably use it every day. i cant stay upside down for more than about 2 min but it did seem to help my back a little so far. it gives a very nice stretch!
2,Chinese torture!,"Nothing against the Chinese but this thing hurts like ....! It seems OK, maybe a little cheap but decent for the price, but the ankle grips hurt so bad you can't use it more then a couple minutes!"
4,"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, finally!","When my table arrived, I couldn't wait for my husband to get home to assemble it. Turned out I didn't have to, it went together without a hitch. From the first use, I could feel a release of pressure in my spine that I hadn't felt in years. I took one star off since no matter how I adjust the height and foot rest, I still have to reach up and pull myself up (if I didn't slip this wouldn't happen). I wear boots so I slip less and can relax my feet, which also reduces the discomfort. I'm happy to deal with a little pressure on my feet in order to experience the euphoric release of pressure on my back, finally! It's amazing how your mood changes when the pain goes away..."
4,Stamina Gravity Inversion Table Review,This product was recommended to me by my chiropractor and my neurologist. It certainly has helped by back problem (I have a ruptured disk in my lumbar spine). I refrained from giving it a five-star recommendation because I find the design of the ankle braces could use some tweaking.
5,Inversion Table works great!,"The cost is reasonable. The product is strurdy and easy to assemble and move around. It is simply an excellent physical conditioning product that is inexpensive, well made, and helps stretch out your joints and back. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,inversion table,junk you get what you pay for. you better make sure someone is with you even if youve been on one before. im 5ft. 7 and i have to set it at over 6ft. to be able to get back up.that probably wouldnt be so bad but now you are not lined up with the back so its very uncomfortable. its a wonder they havnt been sued yet. also the ankle braces are cheesy and uncomfortable. im sorry i tried to go cheap. i was better off going to sports authority for 200. i got a reebock that i can return much more easily if i dont like it. im going to try and give no stars as its not worth 1 star but i already put it in and i dont know if i can change it.
5,Great value,"When I realized I was throwing my lower back out with increasing frequency, I heeded my brother's advice and looked for an inversion table to minimize that and keep the sciatica under control. Went with this thanks to the combination of price, reviews, and free shipping. and have been really pleased with the result. I did add a lumbar cushion for support (the bar is inevitable). Not only is my back much happier, but I sit at a keyboard and this has eliminated my ankle swelling at the end of the work week, my sinuses are draining better, and with the increased blood flow, I've had to reduce my thyroid supplement. Results even if I only use it 5-15 minutes a day, which makes it an easy piece of equipment to stay faithful to. Pretty simple to assemble, very sturdy, and really sweet that it came less than 48 hours after ordering.Stamina Gravity Inversion Table"
4,Works as it should couldn't be happier with it,"Bought this for my wife. She and I both use it. She is smaller and has no problem changing the setup if I have used it. She finds her self in a happier mood after using it for 5 minutes, and I do to. I would recommend it to anyone with the same.ONLY CON: If you don't have space, look for a model that stores better. This one doesn't store very well. We just leave it setup."
3,Has Potential,"I only rated this product a 3 because we have not had it long enough to know if it actually helps your back yet. However, it was fairly simple to put together and use."
3,An okay conclusion to an okay series,"This book concludes Churchill's four-volume history of England and to a lesser extent, the U.S. (and to a much lesser extent, Canada, South Africa and Australia).Although generally good, at times Churchill's pro-English biases shine through. In a way, the whole set seems to be the story of a country growing up and the end is kind of a happy arrival in adulthood. It is interesting to read an ""outsider's"" view of American history, however."
4,gentle,"gentle cleansing towelette- not too harsh, not drying either - a nice combination for your face."
4,Fascinating,"I picked up this book on a whim and found it engrossing from the first page. Since I was born after the baby boomers, It explained alot of things that I had always wanted to learn more about. Certain cultural references made about those times have been cleared up for me. I didn't give it five stars because it is a little wordy, but it is a great commentary on our culture. Read this book if you are a history buff."
3,Not for the casual administrator,"The majority of this book covers transact-SQL, so if you're a developer, you may benefit from this. If you're charged w/ setting up a SQL server and want to take full advantage of Enterprise Manager, then skip this book."
5,Full Disclosure,"This book is probably one of the most complete ones I have read so far. Everything is covered, from Hardware Layout and File - Index structures to basic SQL commands and examples. Great book to read and to keep on your desk as a reference."
4,book,a book that at times seemed hard to find and I wanted it for my collection and I finally found it here
1,Junk Camera,"It's like a plastic toy. There is no diagram with the manual to label the parts. Example: Manual tells you to press MODE button, but you have no idea which button is the MODE button. The drivers are not XP compliant. The quality of the pictures is poor. The product has no redeeming features."
1,Works as a webcam but not as a digital camera,"It's a cute little thing, but who wants to pay $25 for a cute little keychain bobble? Put in a AAA battery, start it up, take one photo, and the battery is dead. But it doesn't tell you the battery is dead, so you keep taking pictures, but they don't get saved. When you go to download the photos, you find you've only got the first one. At the cost of one AAA battery per photo, this has got to be one of the most expensive digital cameras on the market.Works ok as a webcam, but because its not really designed for that, you have to hold it in your hand to use it, so it's more or less useless for that application too.Save your money!"
3,"Simple, works, tiny","I have high-end 35mm file SLRs, a very good digital camera and a smaller, more modest digital camera. But somehow I don't always have one of those with me when I want a photo to capture something important. This little thing is so small that I can take it anywhere and not notice it.IF I am careful to get good lighting -- direct sunlight is best -- and IF I hold the little camera very steady when I shoot, THEN I'll get quite a decent small-pixel digital photo that looks pretty good in an email or on the Web.No, this won't compete with a real digital camera, but then you won't always have that expensive camera with you. This one really can go anywhere with you, and you can get some decent pics if your expectations aren't too high and if you optimize the shot. Bottom line -- it delivers well on what you ought to expect from this tiny product."
2,Not like the short story...,"If you're looking for a feature length version of the great short story, this isn't it. This movie is loosely based on the story but goes off on some weird tangents and loses that great element of surprise ending. The acting is fairly low quality, too. Just read the story."
2,"Well, if you like Lifetime movies....","So, we read the short story ""The Lottery"" by Shirley Jackson in my English Comp II class. Trust me, the ending caught me completely off guard, so I bought this. The movie takes the idea of the story and places it in modern day time. The acting is cheesy (Come on, Dan Cortese? Really? The guy from MTV Sports?)and predictable, but those of you who are fans of the Lifetime Movie of the Week, well, this is the movie for you! I myself would rather stick with the short story. Much less painful."
4,Seeking God,"This book is a tale of a strong woman blinded by society. She tried to seek comfort in society, she sought out love but found abuse. She tried to live her life like society outlines every woman's life but found despair. Facing Our Skeletons details some very interesting stories that most women will probably not want to talk about even though they identify with them. This book is a great book for any woman like myself that seeks approval from society yet the only approval that a woman or a man would ever need would be the approval of God. I received a complimentary copy of Facing our skeletons as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit [...] to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
4,Good glove same problem,"I bought these gloves hoping it would stop me from getting blisters on my thumb from kayaking, but no luck. The gloves are great, I use them on the SeaDoo and kayaking. For both of these activities I do have extra grip on the paddle/handle bar. I only took a star off because I still got blisters during the activity. If you don't have blister problems from squeezing too hard on the bars then I'll highly recommend it for you."
4,Great Album,"This album may not be for everyone, but it is a great album. The best song on it is ""La Fiesta."" The synthesized sounds may take a little getting used to, but the music is genuine and creative. Corea blurs the line between improviser and composer. The side men/women really compliment Corea's ideas in a very coherent way. Joe Farrell is a joy to listen to on sax and flute. If you like this album, you may also like RTF's ""light as a feather,"" as well as ""the leprechan,"" ""my spanish heart,"" and ""the mad hatter,"" by Corea."
5,almost the BEST Chick Corea album,"The only reason I don't rank this as the BEST Return to Forever album is because ""Light as a Feather' and ""Musicmagic"" are even better! La Fiesta is worth the purchase price alone. Stan Getz was so impressed by this and the ""Feather"" album that his Captain Marvel album features contains 3 cuts from the 2 albums, and features Chick Corea on electric piano, Stanley Clarke on electric bass, Airto Moreira on percussion. Flora Purim fits perfectly and effortlessly into the mix. Quite honestly, I've listened to this album so much that I am sick of it. (I have it in vinyl from the 70's.)"
4,Corea's Enjoyable Classic Gets a Little Better!,This version of Chick Corea's popular classic comes is a well-designed mini-lp replica sleeve version which includes the lyrics to the two vocal tracks as well. The sound quality is alright but not great as it hasn't been remastered but this doesn't detract too much from the overall enjoyment of this album which seems to predict the rise of smooth jazz and the kind of keyboard-oriented jazz as popularised by Bob James. Great work by a collection of great musicians make this a very enjoyable listen for all jazz-lovers.
4,Instant Web Pages!,"I used this book to create my company's website because I have very little experience with HTML. Thanks to this book, I had no problem launching it and did not have to worry about coding. Its step-by-step format made it easy to understand and follow. The software complements the book nicely. The whole package is a great value."
4,A MUST HAVE,"The book follows the software program great. It is so easy you can have a web page in minutes if you use the wizard. No experience necessary. Uploads great. I do have problems because of the file extensions .ows and page_1x. .ows is an invalid file and the ""x"" confuses techs when I call for help. The only thing I wish I could see is the html code when I make a wizard page."
4,Helped Me Pass Accounting,"I was taking an Online Accounting Class and just wasn't grasping it. I had resigned myself to failing the class and taking again in a classroom setting, when it hit me...see if there is a workbook somewhere. Came here, saw the recommendations and ordered it. I didn't fail and don't have to take Accounting again. Thank you."
3,"Disappointing ""Conversations""","I'm a big Hemingway fan, and have liked other volumes in this ""Conversations with"" series. But this book was a disappointment to me, and certainly the weakest volume of the ones I've read (Peter Taylor's is excellent, as is the one for Katherine Anne Porter). Unless you're a beginner with Hemingway, there's very little of interest here, except perhaps Hemingway's remark that he writes every novel as though he were going to die afterwards. A related volume, ""The Only Thing That Counts"" -- while a bit slower going, is more useful. Still, if you're a Hemingway fan, you'll probably want to read this anyway. I did."
4,"This is a very nice Thermometer, and surprisingly just a thermometer.","In my attempt to fix my last thermometer I broke it, so I needed to get a new one. And this Springfield thermometer was the perfect replacement for the last Springfield thermometer on my patio. I have compared this new one to the precision thermometer and it is as accurate as it can be. This will not tie your shoes, tell the humidity, call aliens or detect ninjas but this thing does a great job letting you know if you will need a jacket or a bathing suit. This one is pretty light and can fall off a nail in the wind so it should be secured with a small nail on the bottom or hung where there will be minimal wind."
3,Can't It Happen Here?,This is as realistic in 2011 as it was when it was originally penned. This is counter-factual fiction at its best.
5,Great book!,"This book is difficult to get into. The beginning was boring to me and I gave up at page 14. However, I revisited the novel and once I got past the first 14 pages, I couldn't put it down. Great story! After it was over, I was wanting more!"
5,Wake Up Your Political Zombie,"This book is an amazing timeless look at how easily a fascist takeover can happen. How quick it can happen and how important it is to maintain everyone's right in your country. How important it is to really stand up for your values and the rights of others, NOW not later when it is convenient or when you have time to have an opinion. An important read for anyone who is interested in learning a bit about themselves. Would you really stand up or just follow along with someone more popular?"
4,Characteristic Lewis,"As other reviews here have stated, this is not a subtle book. Anyone familiar with Lewis's other works will have no problem recognizing him here: he is heavy-handed and obvious, his writing is ham-fisted and clunkey.But the book works, for the same reasons his more well known books works. Lewis has a fantastic ear for language and tone. His satire is always spot-on. Sure, his characters are exaggerated to the point of being caricatures, but the kernal of truth is always there amid the hyperbole.It's not Babbit or Main Street, but a good read for Lewis fans."
3,All right,"All right, little roughed up, but readable...edges in back chipped and cover split, not as clse to being what was lead to expect."
2,It CAN'T Happen here based on Lewis' intentionally tongue-in-cheek book,"I can't recommend this, unless you are someone interested in the 'future' type of books prevalent in the time period (see 'WE' by Zemyatin, for instance). In this case, a Fascist dictatorship is legally elected and chaos ensues. The characters are caricatures (by design) and the heroes likewise -- it ends up being an allegory like ""Vanity Fair"" or similar.That said, the writing is pretty good, and some of the ideas are interesting. Unfortunately, the Lewis' screed becomes like John Galt's speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged -- boring, repetitive and unrealistic."
2,Laughably dated,"What everyone seems to miss in this tenditious tome is that it was based on Huey Long and was intended to derail his White House express. For a much superior roman a clef on the Kingfish, read Warren's ALL THE KING'S MEN -- even though it also is very loosely based on HPL's exploits."
2,ONLY BECAUSE I HAD TOO..,"I ONLY READ THIS BOOK B/C I HAD TO FOR ONE OF MY MANY ENGLISH COURSES, AND IT WAS EXTREMLEY BORING! MAYBE B/C I JUST IM NOT ATTRACTED TO BOOKS ABOUT POLITICS, AND IN THIS CASE FASCHISM.I'LL GIVE LEWIS THE CREDIT FOR PREDICTING WHATS ALREADY SEEMING TO HAPPEN IN 2006 U.S.A, BUT THIS BOOK IS PRETTY DANG BORIN'...SORRY"
4,Great Book by Sinclair Lewis,I was a big fan of Elmer Gantry -- this book is pretty amazing as well -- His character development always leaves me in awe.
5,"Written many years ago, but resonates with today!","This book get five stars for managing to be so contemporary that one would believe the book was written months ago, rather than decades ago!!"
4,A very complex character,"I have been amazed by this novel because of the ambiguity of its protagonist, Marian Forrester. On the one hand, it seems to me that she is a very good wife who is the perfect companion for her husband; however, on the other hand, she seems to enjoy more than ever when she is accompanied by young men. These very opposed extremes forbid me to state a clear judgement about her. However,I recommend this rather interesting novel"
5,A Book About Old Society,"Compelling in its description of time and place, A Lost Lady is about old railroad society and chronicles the graceful standout Marian Forrester, a great lady of the old school. In a time where ladies wore dresses and were hosts to house parties and dinner parties, Mrs. Forrester, the second wife of Daniel Forrester, comes from California to a small railroad town in the midwest called Sweet Water to homestead and receive great men of the railroad at her home. She falls upon hard times and new money takes over old money, but she is always revered by Neil Forrester, a young boy who watches her downfall. Mrs. Forrester is the last holdout from old times, and she remains a fixture in Neil's memory long after the last railroad has been built."
4,The Lost Frontier,"First Cather book I've read. I was impressed, frankly and I think I'll read more.Set in the 1880's/90's in Nebraska, this book chronicles the relationship of a young boy/man and the wife of a wealthy local luminary. As the boy turns into a man, his early admiration for the lady turns into contempt. Is this about a human relationship or rather a metaphor for the rise and decline of the plains economy in the aftermath of the railroad? Maybe both.One interesting aspect about this book, and, I suppose, all of Cather's work, is that she is writing about a period some twenty or thirty years prior to the era when she was writing. I thought that was pretty cool. She seems like an early example of the ""New Yorker"" style fiction writer.Good stuff."
3,Pleasing and informative but not incredible,"Since I didn't read this book in three days or less I could only give it three stars but it's still two stars above ""Barbarians Led By Bill Gates"". Very entertaining and a cool glimpse inside a start-up. What struck me as most interesting about this book is not what's said, but what it makes you think about: How much has changed since the history of when this story happened. In the compressed and accelerated time-space that current technolgy resides, the ability to experience history and learn from it becomes all the more important."
3,funny but narrow,"Nice stuff about the industry and life inside a start-up. Lots of recognizeable names pop up as bit players - Barry Diller, Halsey Minor. The big revelation in the book, however, is how venal and greedy all the characters are - including the author. Makes you wonder why anyone would want to be an entrepreneur. And like most books about the New World, it feels dashed-off and sloppy."
3,The author comes off as an immature idiot.,"Which is a shame, because we need someone to toss some water on the Internet hype and this writer seems prepared to do so. In telling the story of his company, the author's strategy was apparently to present himself as the only normal man in a land of fools, charlatans, and con men. Unfortunately, the author is no Mark Twain. The book is quite funny but mean-spirited. And the author seems to take pride in the fact that he was a bad businessman. There's no shame in heading a company that didn't succeed, especially in the volatile Internet world. But this guy seems to adopt the literary world's pretensions that business is a de classe vocation anyway, and that his foray into entrepreneurship was slumming."
1,"yawn, yawn.","oh, just what the world needs: another volume of the typical ceo-who's-smarter-than-everyone story, only this time it's done with the special michael wolff brand ""look at who i got to talk to in the exciting world of New Media!!!!!!"" hubris (cf. his column in the industry standard). overblown, overlong, and overly self-promoting, although i guess that's the one skill he seems to have picked up as a result of his hustling with the big boys.when you're reading it, the one thing you notice about BURN RATE is how stupid everyone else seems. when you're done with it, you realize how stupid the book actually is."
1,Don't burn your cash on this one.,"I can't believe that Wolff would acknowledge so much about himself in a book. Burn Rate reveals Wolff's petulant nature, and documents his downward spiral into a money-grubbing loss of integrity. His tale tries to drag everyone he met during his push for IPO down with him, making this a pathetic and depressing read."
2,The book is overrated,"As a writer, Mr. Wolff certainly has the ability to tell a story. However, his definitions of ""media business"", ""communication business"", ""technology business"" and so on are inconsistent and problematic. No wonder he didn't know where his comany was headed."
2,A little dippy,"While I don't know the whole story, Wolff seems to have a lot of experience, and little business smarts. Heck, from the few descriptions of his wife, SHE seems to have more business smarts. This is certainly an interesting, well-written book (he's a writer after all,) but the fact that he drove himself to near insanity as well as bankruptcy all in the name of pure greed leaves me feeling this book has no real point other than ""How I wanted to get rich, or die tryin!"" He described endless begging for money, which seems to be the central point of the book. You will find an interesting set of stories here, but the message is a rather shallow one if there is one at all. But then I guess that was the point of most of the internet bubble as a whole."
4,"A Good Read, Well Written","The best reason to read this book is that it is very well written. The author isn't really a techie, he's a writer, and it shows. It's also nice to read a business book that is so personalized. You see his internal reactions to the various oversized egos and assholes and the people in the industry who just don't know what the hell they're doing. His picture of the venture capitalists was especially vivid. Some of the scenes, like the dealmaking attempts, were just gripping, and his description of dealing with AOL was almost surreal. It makes you wonder how AOL can actually operate as a business, they're so weird and flaky. A really good read."
3,Not bad....but not a must read,"An insider's perspective into the budding world of the internet. A decent read, but not a must read. Didn't capture my attention."
2,Business Blinders,"Michael Wolff's attack on the the Internet Business world is interesting, but he makes the one mistake every business person seems to make: there is more to the world than making money. There is more to the Internet than how it is commercialized. If there are NO businesses on the Internet in the future, it still is going to be important. Since Wolff never get's beyond Television asumptions, he overlooks some of the most interesting things that Internet has to offer in Many to Many communication: the regular guy is just as accessable as the huge corporation. The regular guy can probably make money EASIER than the big corporation. There is more to life than being the organization man..."
1,Only read if want to read everything available on net biz,"This is not a good book. If you want to read everything about net businesses, then go ahead, but I learned about as much on IPOs in the net world from a 10-minute Business Week article on eloan, and most of the stuff about predicting where the net is going is his thinking from a few years ago and is outdated. The book jumped around a lot, and it is hard to stay interested."
2,Hard pill to swallow,"Let's see--you've got the unappealing main gay character, desperate to be straight...a jock addicted to anti-depressants...the alcoholic sex-addicted gay best friend...and the frumpy straight girl who drowns her sorrows in rocky road ice cream and phone sex lines. Add it all up and you have yet another painful addition to the growing list of gay movies with potential that just aren't executed well at all. At best this movie evokes laughter when it probably shouldn't, at worst you wonder if you're watching a bad school play where you're the only one in the audience wondering, why does this hurt so much to watch?"
3,The Killer Cloud from Outer Space!,"You may have heard the theory that ""only the even Trek films are good"" ST:TMP is an odd # and it is a weak ST film. It is important because it was a reuniting of the TV cast (in fact the picture almost starts like the Magnificent Seven collecting bridge crew vets), and the Big budget take on the show was worth the effort... It may take it self too seriously at times, especially in the extended cut, and the beauty passes of the Enterprise seem endless as do the V'Ger clould/ sphincter shots, and the story is sort of a recycled script (Changling)... but I fondly remember seeing this in the theater."
3,Star Trek The Motion Picture Review,"Came in good shape, just started to wonder when it had been shipped. Otherwise totally awesome. :)"
2,"Review of the movie ""Star Trek"" The motion picutre.","Having seen the original series of episodes many, many times over the years, and still love it. Including ALL of the motion pictures, I find this movie to be extremely boring. The special effects were very good, and all, but the movie was very slow, and the script was to me, not a Kirk's ""Star Trek"" script! I would not recommend this movie. I purchased this on VCR when it first came out after watching it, I was let down by what I saw."
5,"No longer ""Star Trek the slow Motion Picture""","I do not know what else to say but excellent, superb, fantastic, Star Trek The Motion Picture is finally a movie I can watch over and over again! It moves right in to the next thing quickly and smoothly..... The added effects were beautifully done and the editing was right on.I loved this movie from start to finish, it was like getting to see the original crew in one more film, and I loved every minute of it. I was hoping to see Enterprise NX-01 in the rec room when Decker showed Ilia the other ships named Enterprise, that opportunity was either overlooked or not enough time to get it in there before the DVD release. But that would have made this movie 100% flawless.This is now by far my very favorite Trek Movie (...)If you do not have this DVD, you must get it! Rather you are a Trek fan or not, now everyone will enjoy it. Robert Wise is .. Wise, he did exactly what needed to be done. (...)"
3,My thoughts on the film,I liked Shat's performance in this. He did a great job. I like the crew's uniforms here. They look like what the creww should've worn on TOS. I actually loathe the arctic-like uniforms they wore from Wrath of Khan on. I see nothing wrong with Stephen Collins as the Will Decker character being respectful to Admiral Kirk (unlike another poster here). Ilya exhibits a certain sexuality once she dons the bathrobe and high heeled sandals. It's admittedly a slow film but that gives us more time with the TOS characters. Better with repeated viewings.
1,"Colorless, uninteresting resumption of the Star Trek legacy","Take an original Star Trek episode and draw it out to three times the usual length, take away the humor, throw in some post-Star wars special effects, and finally add in some uninteresting new characters, and there you have it ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"".Admittedly there is some initial fun in seeing the old crew back after a ten year hiatus but this fun drains away pretty quickly. Long, boring and colorless - right down to the drab production design - even fans will struggle to sit through this one. You get the feeling that director Robert Wise was so conscious of being respectful of the material that he ended up embalming it. If this review is not warning enough, this film has been recut twice all to no avail."
3,Where's Chekov?!!,"I like this movie fairly well, but I have to lower its ranking by a star, simply because of the fact that the filmmakers chose not to include Chekov. Rick Berman has done so much damage to the Trek franchise, and this was one of his earliest errors. No matter what Mr. Berman may think, Chekov was a valuable part of the television show, adding a Russian flavor to the show's international stew. To not include him is not only wrong, it's borderline offensive.Walter Koenig is a fine actor, and I'm glad Berman saw fit to let him participate in the other Trek movies. His presence here would have made a decent movie very good, at the very least. If you're looking for your Chekov fix, watch Star Trek II."
1,NOT Star Trek!,"Oh, yeah, the enhanced scenery was nice, in some cases even better than the original, but for a long-time Star-Trek fan like me, this version (The Director's Edition) has one modification that totally ruined it. One of the scenes in the all important climax, the one where Decker remarks: ""But of course! We all create God in our own image."" was dropped from this version, no doubt in deference to the more pious consumers. Now this remark was not gratuitous, it was the main moral message and lesson of the entire adventure and an intrinsic aspect of the Star Trek phenomenon which made it (Star Trek) what it is today.Dropping those two lines from the movie changed it from a deeply significant work to just another shaggy-dog story. Boo! Mr. Director. I will hunt down and buy the original cut, thank you."
3,"Better, but still a long, long way from being a home run.","The flaws of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" never bothered me that much upon its release, but this new version, while better, still is a long way from greatness.The revised special effects are an improvement over some of the flawed originals (particularly the final scenes involving the walk to V'ger), and director Robert Wise has trimmed a lot of the unnecessary dialogue, but the main problem with this film was a script that packed too little excitement.Unfortunately, that can't be cured with better visual effects or more effective film edits. This film was always a visual treat, but the characters and script let it down badly, and they still do.Still, this film IS a good time, especially for Trekkies, and simply watching it in widescreen, on DVD, makes the film look and feel a whole lot better. Paramount also included some terrific bonus materials on the making of the film, and the aborted Star Trek TV series that became the film series."
1,Why ruin a good film?,I was very upset That some of the dialog was cut from the directors edition and also the computers voice in the background. I thought it made it sound more like what life really would be like on a starship. I wish they would just release a copy of the original cut of the movie. Most of the rework on this really didn't make much of a difference. I guess I'll be forced to buy a foriegn VCD copy in order to get the original cut. Not worth the wait or the hype.
2,eh,"only saw it once a long time ago, but i recall that it moved very slow and didn't seem to draw me in. i guess that's why they took such a long time to put this one out on dvd."
1,Have the fast forward button ready...,"If you actually buy this movie: be aware that an enormous amount of time will be wasted seeing gratuitous special effects. Five minutes to see William Shatner being beamed up, probably an hour's worth of shots of the Enterprise moving through V'Ger's cloud, and scenes (the wormhole one for example) added on just for the sake of special effects! Yes, there is a story here, but you'll probably fall asleep before you get there."
3,STMP DVD Disappointment,"I'm a pretty big Star Trek fan and couldn't wait for this DVD to arrive, however I've been somewhat disappointed. The advertisements say 7 hours of bonus materials, and that seems to be more of a technicality. Most of the bonus material is commentary. The ""deleted scenes"" are nothing more than scenes deleted from this DVD version, originally shown in the theatrical release. I do admit that the TV spots and trailers are interesting, but I guess I was hoping for more. The DVD is till a ""must have"" for any Star Trek fan, but don't purchase this thinking you're going to see an abundance of ""fresh"" Star Trek you haven't seen before. The STMP VHS Special Longer Version is actually longer than this DVD version and contains the scenes listed under ""additional"" in the DVD disc 2."
5,A whole new movie!,"This special ""Reunion Movie"" now has all the glitter it deserves. This is a ""must-have"" for all Star Trek fans. The sound remix is awesome. Many scenes were cut out, and many scenes were added. Some new special effects were added in just the right places. I thought the original version had too much lighting - that too was fixed. I can now watch this movie over and over again without getting bored! The bonus features were great as well. I especially enjoyed finally hearing the story on Star Trek:Phase II (The series that almost was). The Director's edition-DVD crew deserves a big round of applause!"
4,Great tv show turned into a great movie!,Star Trek returns after a 10 year absence. This movie paved the way for 9 sequels and 4 tv shows. A must have.
2,Now I remember,"I first saw this movie in the theatre in 1979. I remember being horribly bored, with pictures of taking ""forever"" cruising around the new Enterprise, showing me how ""ooh"",""ahh"",""pretty"", the new Enterprise was. And showing me ""look how much like Star Wars we are"" special effects. I vowed at that time that I would never watch this boring thing again. When this DVD version came out, I had heard it was supposed to have been improved. I figured, ""OK, I'll give it another chance."" Well, this did a great job of reminding me why I vowed I'd never watch this thing again. It's still as boring, for all the same reasons, as it was 22 years ago. Yawn."
2,First the worst!,"Ok so this movie has been enhanced with new special effects, and features intriguing extras. The film has also been edited in places, which does make ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Edition"" alot more watchable than the original. However, the movie still ... It is way too slow. Obviously if you're a Star Trek fan you're going to get all the movies to complete your collection. But to you Star Trek fans, be honest with yourselves, the movie is just boring. I suggest you buy it to compliment your collection, and watch it, the commentaries and the extra features once, before storing it away until ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Real Short Version"" comes out. The only really positive thing I can say about ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", is that it did lead to ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan""."
3,NOW IT IS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN,IT IS NO STAR WARS BUT THE EXTRA WORK HAS TURN IT FROM A PONDEROUS MOVIE THAT WAS RUSH TO A CLASSY PIECE OF WORK AND THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON RELEASE. THE SMALL BUT CLEVER UPDATES HAVE INCREASED YOUR ENJOYMENT ALOT AND NOT JUST FOR TREKKIES BUT JUST A GOOD AFTERNOON WATCH. ASHAME THE CLASSY START DID NOT CONTINUE INTO THE MOVIES THAT FOLLOWED MORE ACTION YES BUT LESS CLASSY VISUALS
2,A Nice Try,"Over all I was disappointed with this Director's Cut of the film. While the remixing of the soundtrack was an imporvement (the addition of the classic bridge sounds was an especally nice touch), I found it un-necessary to edit or ""shorten"" any of the scenes from the 1979 theatrical release, and the story once again suffers from the lack of plot explanation scenes from the 1983 television version. Further the replacement in the soundtrack of several background effects (the original computer warning ""red alert"" system is replaced with the serine from the original series) is awkward at best. While the new special effects shots were a nice touch they add little to the overall feel of the film. I still find I enjoy the 1983 ""Special Edition"" (yes, even with the scene of Kirk on the set) best. My ratting: A for intentions but a C for overall effect."
3,"Decent Extras, Terrible & Uneven Transfer","I,ve been looking forward to this for quite some time, and it comes as quite a disappointment in terms of the look of the film itself. The space sequences are very dark and lack contrast and detail. The interior scenes at the beginning are way too warm and yellow. There are a lot of scratches on this transfer. The overall look of the picture is dull and blurry. This is all made very obvious to any viewer when you compare the movie's appearance to the dvd menu screens. The menus are rich and vibrant in colour and detail, where as the film itself is dark, flat and murky. Maybe the film's '70's cinematography is dated though, but other Robert Wise dvd's such as the ""Sound of Music"" look incredible! Not all the film is terrible but the tranfer is very uneven. 60% of the tranfer looks fine."
5,Everything you ever wanted fixed!,Beautiful homage to the original intent. Amazing V'GER in full light! The new spoundtrack with sound effects in place makes it worth it alone!
2,Poor print...,"I love the movie but is there something wrong with Robert Wise's glasses? This 40 million dollard movie is full of speckes and scratches all along. The restored scenes are fine the sound is very good, but the rest looks like an old ""BETA"" print!! I also wonder why the Klingon battle music theme was cut at the beginning?? The score is one of the most beautiful score ever written for a movie, why cut it? Most of the scenes that were added for the TV version are cut. Weren't those scenes requested by the fans at that time? I would have liked both versions on the same DVD. Look at Fox's ABYSS and ID4, and what about the French track?? I guess I was expecting too much! I'm very disappointed and Paramount's DVD's are still too expensive."
3,Star Trek - The Unfinished Motion Picture,"I saw ST-TMP when it was first released in December of 1979. I had eagerly awaited the movie's release because I have been a fan of Star Trek since the original series. The movie, as I have come to find out, was released in a hurry and was not finished as it should have been. Now, I am eagerly awaiting the release of the new DVD ""completed"" version, and I'm hoping that it will be better than the original. Most people I have discussed the original with say that it is just an updated version of the ""Nomad"" episode of the original series. Indeed, there are many similarities evident, both in the book and the movie. BUT... I've seen the movie many times and still enjoy it every time. I guess you have to be a true Star Trek fan to understand it."
5,Star Trek is always good,I have been re-watching the entire series and The motion picture has always been at the top of my list. Share it with the kids.
3,Star Trek Forevever!,"When you grow up watching Star Trek, you just can't quit watching it. Beam me up Spock, there is no intelligent life here...."
3,Veerrryyyy Loooong Introduction to the Star Trek Universe,"This was my first viewing of the original cast series of films and while it contained beautiful visuals, there were too many lingering shots of space.I believe that at the time of the film's release it was more the novelty of the original cast re-uniting than the plot that brought people to the theaters. Although interesting enough to keep my attention, it was very slow and this extended cut wasn't helping.Although I haven't see the theatrical cut, I can only imagine that instead of it taking 5-10 minutes for Kirk to reach the newly re-fitted Enterprise for the first time, it only takes 2-3 and that we do not watch every minute of the ships approach toward the mysterious cloud on the front view screen.The performances and story were much improved by the time the sequel was released. There is no insight gained into the characters through this extra footage."
4,Finally on DVD,"I do not know why it took so long to release the first Star Trek movie on DVD. All other Star Trek Movies are already around on DVD for quite a while. I can only guess. Okay, there is not much action, but the story is compelling. I do not know why most of the people always think about galactic battles, when they think about a Sci-Fi Movie. The best Sci-Fi Stories are about People, Society and Mankind (like Arthur C. Clarkes's ""2001:A Space Odyssey"", ""2010:The year we make contact"", Wolfgang Petersons ""Enemy Mine"" and Carl Sagan's ""Contact"").I would have given the movie 5 stars, but the acting was a bit poor in some of the scenes. I think this movie is not just for Star Trek fans, ""Trekkies or Trekkers"". I think this movie is something for everyone, who is not a pure action freak and wants to think about a movie and its messages.(Original review January 1, 2002)"
4,"From a fan, but not a treky","Well, it took them long enough to release this on DVD. I like what they did with the ""touch ups"". They enhanced the film without going over the top with CGI and sound FX. The sidle changes are noticeable, but do not de-tract from its original content, and the text commentary was a nice surprise. The result is a fine finished product any Star trek fan will appreciate. The second disc is full of extras, deleted scenes, storyboards, etc...Buy it, watch it, live long, remember and rejoice.PS: I hope they do as good a job on the rest of them."
3,DVD vs. VHS,How is the DVD different that the VHS Director's Edition that's been out for many years?
2,the case,"I bought this dvd and am very dispointed in the case the first discs hub is missing a tab a the top so the discs comes out very easy and it scratches it up every time. Are all of the dvds like this or did I get a bad copy, If someone would post a response I would appreciate it because I will reurn this disc if mine is the only one like this other wise there is no reason to bother excahnging it."
1,horribly boring,I really did NOT like this movie. It put me to sleep. I had to watch it in three sittings. I do not recommend it.
2,"My ""Star Trek The Motion Picture"" Review","To sum this film accurately enough in one sentence: It's only effective as a cure for insomnia. This was the worst of the ""Star Trek"" films simply due to the fact that it's extremely dull. I've tried to watch it a few times over the past 10 years or so and come dangerously close to falling asleep each time-I'm not exaggerating.The films special effects (which the film relied too much on) and musical score are astounding, however. If it weren't for those 2 elements, I would only give the film one star. The first 30 minutes are entertaining, but from there it goes straight downhill. Despite all of ""Star Trek V""'s flaws, at least it wasn't boaring as ""TMP"" was.I do plan to purchase the film on DVD solely due to the fact that I want to see the theatrical trailer. I really enjoy those. Too bad ""Generations"" didn't have one."
2,"Slow, boring, not charming","I am a longtime Star Trek fan, but this movie is a real snoozer. There is virtually no action in this film. There's no moral force acting in the plot, and the film doesn't bother to even speculate what meaning the ending has. Admiral Kirk is depicted as connivingly seizing command of the Enterprise, then incompetently commanding. Spock is shown with zero personality. Whatever sex appeal the movie might have had was tossed out the window when they shaved Ilia's head. If you don't believe me on how bad this film is, just go read its entry in W1kipedia. The actors hated the script, the costumes, and had no camraderie. The only saving grace of the film is that it was clearly the inspiration forGalaxy Quest."
2,Star Trek: the special LONGER cut,"(this does not refer to the DVD director's edition edit)One of the most popular tv shows of it's time(and one of the most popular movie franchises) Star Trek: the movie is a winner. This slow-paced scifi flick maybe hard to watch if your one of those desparate viewers who won't wait forever something to happen(or boring as heck). Granted Star Trek is worth it down to the final climax, this 12 minutes of more footage is not needed! It is long as it is and it needs to be cut down to 2hrs or shorter!This movie does have a lot of pausing and a lot of scenes where they are ""hoing and aweing"" at the special effects for 7 mins or so. Some movies need longer cuts,but obviously Star Trek didn't.(2 1/2 stars actually)"
4,"Uhm, I liked the original better","The extras are great, lots of material there. Most of the revisions in this version are good additions, too. There are just some moments where I think the original cut was better. Particularly the formation of the bridge between the Enterprise and V-Ger. The new version is just too long. Most all the other additions were good, though. I'd like an original version of the movie on DVD all the same. But that's just my two-cents, and I'm the only guy on the planet that hates every ""Next Generation"" movie..."
3,"Starts out well, then bogs down","This movie has been heavily criticized over the years by fans and even by the people who created and starred in it, but ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" does have it's strong points. The first half of the movie is actually pretty good. The story is interesting and the characters have things to do. But the second half of the film is really slow and boring. Talk, talk, talk. This is the part where the Enterprise discovers the V'Ger system. During this segment, Spock even has a brief scene where he cries over V'Ger! Oh, brother. So, in rating ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", I'd give the 1st half an A-, the 2nd half a C-, for an overall grade of B-."
2,Not the best start for Star Trek on the Big Screen,"This film has good visual effects, but I think it is boring as hell! (I almost fell asleep when I saw it the first time) Also, the characters do not act like they used to in the series. Unbelievably, the FX are the best of all the first five movies."
3,"""Director's Cut"" Should Have Boldly Gone Further","There's little argument that Robert Wise's belated ""director's cut"" of ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"" is an improvement over the original 1979 release. However, this big-screen debut represents the weakest (and slowest) of the series, partially redeemed by some awe-inspiring visual effects and Jerry Goldsmith's classic score. The camaraderie between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is sadly lacking, while the remaining Enterprise players are overshadowed by the unnecessary addition of Captain Decker (a horrible performance from Stephen Collins). Luckily, you can hit the warp-speed button during the film's several ""longueurs,"" which Wise should have pared down even further. Though flawed, ""Star Trek - The Motion Picture"" succeeds as a preview of better voyages to come."
4,Star Trek Redux,"Say what you want about Paramount and their milking the Star Trek cow dry, they definitely did right by the fans by releasing this director's cut of the first movie. Viewing it again, it's not as bad as the critics made it out to be. Visually, it's the best looking of the movies (except for those Dr. Denton Star Fleet Uniforms). Let's face it, V'ger was always just the maguffin to get the original crew back together, and I can remember back in 1979 when anticipation ran high on this picture (just like in the 1960's when a new Connery Bond was due). The enchanced effects and tighter editing definitely improves the film, and I'm glad that grandmaster Robert Wise was involved (God, we could use a director who can combine art and technique like him again). So see it again, for the first time..."
5,best star trek ever,this is the best star trek from the movies or tv series. very intelligent movie. if you are looking for a star wars type action film this is not it. more along with 2001 space odessy.
3,Robert Wise vision not the best for star trek,"Ok, I have to say that I approve of directors cuts. This dvd is loaded with deleted scenes and finalized special fx that the director didn't get to finish the first time around. However I first must say that this movie bored me the first time in 1979 and it bores me now. Star trek isnt about watching 30 minutes of special fx of Vger. Its about the relationships of Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew. I personally prefer the versions of this movie with the extra dialog scenes added back in. Vger drags on and on. I'm one of the few that would rather watch star trek 5. Now the directors cut of trek II rocks."
3,Not as bad as everyone says,"OK, we Trekkers know all the knocks against this movie by heart. Dull sets, wooden dialogue, bloated budget, costumes that show off Stephen Collins' 'package', too many shots of the Enterprise, etc, etc...But what about the GOOD features of this film? First, it's amazing how much the actors - save Nimoy - feel at ease with one another. DeForrest Kelley, in particular, is a delight to watch. Too bad he wasn't in more scenes.And the visual effects, particularly VGER, are outstanding. To this day, VGER is entirely convincing, and an amazingly well-executed ""alien"" ship.And the movie does succeed in a way - as a kind of revisionist 2001 exercise. And it DID bring Trek back. For that we can say...huzzah."
2,A DULL MOVIE FOR EVEN A STAR TREK FILM,"I thought STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE was too long and drawn out. I mean I liked seeing KIRK, MCCOY, and SPOCK and all the rest of the original series characters but I didn't get the whole VY'GER storyline and the action in this film takes too long to appear in the film. Anyway see STAR TREK II instead you'll like it a lot better."
3,Wake me up when it's over,"As a devout Star Trek fan, I faithfully saw this film in the theater when it made its local debut. The individual entrances of the key players like William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley even drew applause from the audience. Unfortunately, it appears the producers of this flick wanted to stretch the plot intended for an hour-long episode of the TV show into a two-and-a-half hour feature motion picture. Despite all its special effects, the movie is just too long and slow moving to keep even the most ardent of Trek fans interested."
3,special longer version explains things better,This film has grown on me over the years. I can only hope when it is finally released in DVD that it is the Special Longer Version in Widescreen. I did as another reviewer suggested. Watched it again with the Borg element of V-ger's existence. Wow--that explains alot!
4,A good beginning,"I hadn't watched this movie for a while but when I picked it back up, I remembered why I love Star Trek. The plot may be a little hoky and the special effects aren't as sharp and stunning as today's special effects, but its a good story and brings the crew back in style. Personally I like some of the cheesiness of Star Trek and I think so of the cliches make it work well. Its a story filled with comradery, dedication, and adventure...definitely worth seeing."
2,This One Was Too Long,"Maybe if it were cramped into 1-1/2 hours it would have been better. Ok yeah the inside of V'Ger like cloud was pretty, I guess, if you like scenic tours. But they spent too much time with that in the movie, then followed by what seemed like wasting time till the final 10 minutes of the movie. The beginning of the film is great, seems to have a fast paced move to it, but it slows down way too much after halfway. This is the least favorite Star Trek film of mine, but I guess since it was made in '79, it not so bad. But Star Wars was in '77, and look how good they did. So I guess this one's not too great. If you love Star Trek, like me, you'll still watch it. If you are new to Star Trek, skip this film and go onto the 2nd film."
2,A dull plodder.,"Astonished humans watch as three Klingon battle cruisers are destroyed in a huge cloud which is on a direct course to Earth. And so James T.Kirk and crew are sent to deal with the threat.Unfortunately, for most of this film very little happens. It seems to be aimed more at '2001' fans than 'Star Trek' fans. The characters are rarely allowed to show character and some of the dialogue is pretty stupid ('it disappeared down what they used to call a black hole'). Who exactly talks like that?Good special effects and a wonderfully atmospheric score save this film from being a one-star. Thank goodness the makers of Star Trek 2 onwards knew what the series was supposed to be about."
4,A very under-rated movie,"I think most people may not have liked the first Tek film as much as the others is because expectations were too high. It also did not have the elements of the show that the Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock had, but looking back now it is a good film in it's own right. It was slower-moving, but I takes a lot of hard work to make the transition from small screen to silver screen. Case in point: X-Files Fight The Future.A huge cloud is vaporizing everything in it's path, and the only ship capable of intercepting it in time is the refurbished Enterprise, with a new captain and crew. But Kirk takes command, and brings along his old bridge officers. The takes a while to get moving, but it is an interesting first look at the movie series, and still an enjoyable experience."
2,"The ship, alien innards, and 5 minutes of lousy plot","What a disappointment. Half of the movie is grandiose views of the new ship. A quarter of it is psychedelic views of V'Ger innards. The rest is a lame plot warm-over of ""The Changeling"" (Nomad). A major disappointment to a major Trekkie."
4,old trekkie,I have been a trekkie since before the word was coined. This completes my collection of the movies. It makesa good compliment to my series collection
2,one long lumberingly boring journey,"the best STAR TREK films are parts 2,4,6, GENERATIONS & FIRST CONTACT. parts 3,5, & INSURRECTION weren't so good. and so does this 1st chapter with kirk and crew. so i have seen the director's cut of THE MOTION PICTURE on dvd recently. new special effects have been added that we haven't seen in 1979. when the film came out december of that year, the movie wasn't even finished according to its director robert wise. the ""finished"" product is improved in the fx dept but this is still 1 slooooooowwww ride on the enterprise. lotta talk, miniscule humor and very tiny action. wise wasn't a wise choice for this film. to me, he was never good in making scifi flicks; 1971's THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was another snoozer from him. then came THE WRATH OF KHAN with a better director, nicholas meyer and the film series blasted off from there. let's see what occurs with the newest trek movie, NEMESIS out late 2002 directed by stuart baird (U.S. MARSHALS)."
3,SOW'S EAR,"""You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"". That old-fashioned bit of wisdom perfectly describes this DVD's attempt to rehabilitate the flawed original movie. The reason? Sluggish editing and unfinished effects were only a few of the problems with this film. The main one, which is unfixable, is a poor script. Then there's stiff acting from the beloved original crew, who don't appear to be having much fun. And, those unnecessary new characters who were thrown into the film simply because they had been part of the ill-fated ressurection of the television series. Sterile, gray sets. The DVD is redeemed only by the interesting features on the second disk."
2,This isn't Star Trek,"Captain Kirk gets back control of the Enterprise and goes to investigate a mysterious cloud making its way towards Earth.Though this film stars all the crew from the original '60s series, it is more akin to an Arthur C.Clarke film than Star Trek. Okay, so it might please fans of 2001, but as somebody who enjoyed the original Star Trek series I was bored rigid. The special effects are faultless, true, and there is a superbly ominous soundtrack, but nothing much actually happens for most of the film. And some of the dialogue is pretty silly - ""It disappeared down what they used to call a black hole"". Who talks like that?Fans of special effects or 2001-type science-fiction might enjoy this, but fans of the Star Trek series would be better off watching 'Wrath of Khan' onwards."
2,sllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooowwwwwww...........,"The problem with this film is that they expand an episode's worth of material into an entire film--and a LONG film at that. The previous reviewer is wrong--it's not a matter of being too action-oriented to accept a more cerebral plot; it's simply the film's appalling sense of pace. The endless panoramic views (the opening, panning around the ship, takes, I kid you not FIFTEEN MINUTES), while somewhat interesting in their own right, do not exactly make for riveting viewing. With some decisive editing, this could have been a decent hour-long feature, but as it is it just meanders interminably. Worth seeing for die-hards, but not for ordinary civilians."
3,"Very good, but with some problems","I cried tears of joy when I first saw this movie in the theater. Thats how big a ST fan I am. But this DVD has serious problems. I can't understand why they did not clean up the film better. The noise during the darker scenes made me think I was watching the film at a theater that had already played it 200 times. I found this to be a major distraction, especially since the noise stopped during the new CG scenes. Several scenes have been deleted, supposedly to tighten up the story. But this version of the movie will still be boring to any one, except Star Trek fans like me, who would have appreciated the deleted scenes. Only for tue fans."
1,very disappointing,"this film has some very good special effects,but the film goes on way too long,is very dull,and lots of times the camera tends to focus on special effects,just for the sake of showing off all the effects they created. if this film wasn't so long,it might have been passable entertainment."
1,I thought the original was boring,"I remember the film moving slow, but I was almost in a coma by the end. There was just not enough of story to warrant two hours for this film. So, we see long static shots of the Enterprise and space that do not move the story.The acting was even worse. Part of the reason this film dragged so much is that the director and the actor's did not build the tension of their impending doom. It is hard to get caught up in the chance of them all dying when the actors are just like it's any other day at the office.Don't get me wrong. I love most of the other Star Trek movies, but this one is just a major dissapointment."
1,The movie that sank like the Titanic,"This movie sank like the Titanic. The first 50 minutes were good. Then you start saying to yourself, ""What am I doing in front of the TV?"" The movie spent too much time inside the alien (V'Ger): It spent about 80 minutes in the alien. The problem was that they had nothing to do in that time segment.When they tried to pull two people from the transporter (including the new science officer). When they said the people were going into final form, or something like that, you say, ""Oh, wow. That's nice.""So basically, I don't think it was a good first movie."
3,Movies on amazon,The picture quality was fine but the sound sucked. There's no option for subtitles so that was a downer. Although I've seen this movie a few times it would have been nice to be able to make out what they were saying without blasting the tv volume.
4,As Much Fun as I Remember,"I loved this movie when it first came out and it was great fun to watch it again. If you are not a Trekie, you will probably feel that too much time is spent on celebrating the Enterprise itself. But the end of the movie is unexpected and makes the movie worth watching."
4,Better than I remember,It's more fun to watch with some age on it. The updates on the effects and editing make it flow better. Like watching a 2hr episode from the original series.
3,It's a Trek,"The Good Things*Neat special effects. Lots of cool models and lots of interesting imagery.*Interesting story.*Even though the characters seemed dull at first, they are all right.*Good music.The Bad Things*Very long and slow. It resembles ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" more than ""Star Trek.""*Decker and the bald girl (and possibly Spock) serve as the main characters, while Kirk and everybody else is subdued.*Some inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise (like their God-awful uniforms...).This film is mildly interesting, but hardly does justice to the ""Star Trek"" universe. It is probably better to see this as a different, original space opera than as a ""Star Trek"" film."
5,Star Trek: the Motion Picture DVD,I think Paramount did a good job with this special edition. I looked foward to watching Star Trek with a commentary. It's filled with goodies that I recommend to any trek fan. All star Trek fans would really go for this.
3,The Film That Re-Launched The Franchise,"STTMP is important in the sci-fi world mostly because it brought about the rejuvenation of the franchise.After dickering about with a proposed new series in the 70s, Roddenberry decided to go with a feature film that would reintroduce the crew to a new generation of fans. To be honest I have mixed feelings about it; the production values were great for the time, yet the story seemed awfully thin. Additionaly, the main characters looked a little out of practice with thier characters (but that was definately gone in ST2: The Wrath of Kahn).A little too funky for my taste, but what's important is that it brought them back and even now spawns great shows."
1,Star Trek - The Motion Pictor,This is the WORST Star Trek movie EVER made. Don't waste your time or money on this!
5,The Human Adventure.,"Star Trek The Motion Picture is a good film. It works on many different areas of entertainment..but Star Trek The Motion Picture-Director's Edition will be a great film. As good as the first version was, for years it has been handicaped by a horrible rush to release date, which meant many unedited optical effects and no preview screening. For years this has rankled its director, Robert Wise, the acclaimed director of The Sound Of Music and The Day The Earth Stood Still, and editor of Citizen Kane. Now, over twenty years later, Mr. Wise has been given the opportunity to go back and restore, rework, and refurbish this classic film. It will feature a reworked soundtrack, additional scenes,improved optical effects and more. It's thought provoking storyline, wonderful Jerry Goldsmith score, fondly familiar characters,and beautiful visual style make for a fulfiling cinematic experience.The Human Adventure Is Just Beginning..."
3,too slow,"i love startrek, and like all the other startrek movies except this one. if you liked close encountered of the 3rd kind or e.t you might like this, if you liked independence day,you wont like this. It was really slow, but thanks to this moviethe other startrek movies came to be."
2,blah,"This movie is too long with too many slow scenes in it. The later Star Trek movies are much better than this first one. This one nearly put me to sleep, it was so long and boring."
3,Has gotten better with time !,"When I watched STTMP in 79 I dosed off a couple of times and thought it was very boring.The acting was stiff and the uniforms looked liked pajamas.As an adult now, I appreciate the movie a bit more and enjoy the special effects."
3,Still not my old TREK,"Everyone seems hyped up about the new f/x and such; but my issue with STTMP is that our most revered characters are relegated to second-tier status. The plot is an obvious rehash of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" with a misguided attempt to thrust new unknown characters into the lead roles. HUGE mistake.Thankfully WRATH OF KHAN corrected all that, and saved TREK from franchise oblivion.STTMP actually works better if you think of it as the LAST in the series, rather than the first."
3,Enhancements are always good - but too many cuts.,"As the other reviews will tell you, the enhancements are great. Computer graphic additions and improvements/changes/additions to the sound effects make this a great remake. It could have been five stars, but someone should have told Mr. Wise that ""director's cut"" doesn't necessarily mean ""cut it"". He should have created a ""special edition"" DVD and not tried so hard to shorten the movie. There were some major scenes completely removed and alot of other scenes got little cuts in them. Viewers are used to the full length version. Remember the scenes they chopped back out of Star Trek II? This is similar - only worse. I hope whenever they get around to making the special edition for Star Trek II, they ""Wise"" up and put the scenes back in this time."
3,Overlong but interesting first big screen outing,"At the time many were so glad for a new Trek, that we ignored the flaws in this ambitious undertaking.There are many, not the least of which is a plodding pace that prevents the movie from ever building up any momentum. Every time we are on our way, something stops the action. Much time is wasted explaining how the gang got back together. The ""protaganists"" are given little chance to do much protaganizing, and the ending is a rehash of an old '60s episode.Ambitious effects make the Enterprise look better than perhaps any version before or since, and later scenes portraying the intruder are spectacular, if a bit slow.The high point of the movie is the soundtrack, that mixes a sense of wonder and danger using many unusual sounds and orchestration to achieve a perfect otherworldly effect.There will be a director's cut DVD soon, that has some newly reworked scenes and effects, and it will be interesting if some of the flaws are corrected in that version."
2,Correction:Star Trek - the SLOW MOTION picture,"The excellent effects and the haunting soundtrack are the only things really worth seeing this for. It's all very slow, aimless and more akin to 2001 than Star Trek. This is the series' first full-length film, and it's hardly a great debut."
2,So-so movie,"It's good to see the Star Trek characters, again. But this movie is WAY too long. Skip this one and see The Wrath of Khan instead!"
2,Only for diehard star trek fans.,It is amazing that this movie was the biggest movie of 1979. It is not very good and very confusing. Possibly the worst in the long series.
2,"It was an okay movie, but by no means the best.","Star Trek: The Motion Picture was all dazzle and no substance. It lacked character development and warmth. It was visually stunning and technically facsinating. For a rainy day, watch the movie and guess how many times William Shatner's hair moves."
2,Not a good start for the films,"Someone, possibly the writer Harlan Ellison, possibly Steve my butcher, once called this The Motionless Picture. He was right. Terrible idea, terrible pacing, terrific special effects, and no fun watching Kirk and crew reunite. I can remember being about 13 when this movie came out, actually dozing off in the movie theater. Stick with Star Trek 2, 4, 6 and 8. All the even ones."
3,No character,"The original Star Trek movie was a really big missed opportunity for the Star Trek franchise. The Original Series was defined by its wonderful characters, particularly Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. In this movie, the characters take a back seat. We still see Kirk, Spock, and McCoy but they seem muted and relatively uninteresting. They seem like accessories to the plot, not drivers of it. Even relatively emotional scenes like Kirk ordering the self-destruction of the ship had almost no tension or emotional impact. It's a shame, because the concept behind the story was really interesting.I will say that the Director's cut for the DVD and blu-ray does improve the film. Some of the special effects are tastefully improved. It looks good - in my opinion a visually more beautiful film than 2001."
3,"An improvement, but still dull","This director's cut by Robert Wise has some minor visual and audio improvements. Other editing is done as well, which is explained on the DVD. But overall, I still think this is a dull movie, and I'm a Star Trek fan. The DVD does have some nice behind-the-scenes documentaries. In fact, I found them to be more interesting than the movie itself."
3,Slow,"This movie was an efficient stepping stone for the movie series. It was elegant, the special effects were avrage in some areas, (Klingon ships)but astounding in others,( warp drive). The music was good but the story line and character development was in need of help."
3,The classic series graduates to the silver screen!,"This picture was a mixed bag when it first came out years ago. It was terrific seeing the original cast back in action and fantastic to see the new Enterprise and all those special effects. On the other hand, several long, drawn-out sequences and a apparent recycling of ""Star Trek"" TV plotlines (""The Changeling"", for one) were drawbacks. What saves the film is seeing that wonderful trio, Kirk, Spock and McCoy, together again (not to mention the rest of the crew), and the terrific musical score."
4,Best VI book yet,"I knew little about VI before reading this book, but I now i feel very comfortable using it. I like the layout and the fact that it has references and summaries all over the book. This is a book you will most likely use again and again. My only complaint were the chapters on advanced editing which were hard to understand if you are not versed in regular expressions (hence the 4 stars). Still, I learned much from this book, and hope you will too. VIVA Oreilly!"
5,A Must Have!,"This book will help you to work smarter. With this book, I'm discovering so many powerful commands that I never knew existed. This is one of the better books in my collection....even if most of my collection is made up of books from O'Reilly & Associates. These books are wells of information. This book is fantastic!"
4,Great Overview,"For anyone new to the technology or interested in learning the technology behind creating VPNS, this a a very useful book. The author has done a good job explaining in detail what is necessary. More and more companies are turning to VPN's to provide themselves with secure means of transmitting company information and resources. this book will help get you in the right direction1"
5,Pure pleasure!,This is pure listening pleasure!I have always loved the sounds of Jeff Healey - and this was certainly no disappointment!
1,Good God This Sucks,"Everything I've heard from Jeff Healey up til now has been phenomenal but THIS...This is not Jeff Healey, this is Frank Sinatra or some type of ragtime swill from the twenties. In fact, much of it sounds like an old time cartoon soundtrack. Like when Bluto grabs Olive Oyl and makes her dance with him.I understand the title now, ""Among Friends."" Because only a friend would buy this."
5,"Best price, perfect for crafts","Purchased these paints to finish off my salt dough ornaments for Christmas. the paints were great, just what I was looking for."
5,Sargent Art 66-5420 6-Jar Acrylic Colors,My son loves to use these paints. They are great for him to learn about colors and mixing them together and what effects white and black have when added to other colors. So far we have painted air dry clay with these paints. And we have painted on paper.
4,Looks good,"Honestly I made a big mistake, because I needed one mail scale. But the seller sent the iten very fast and complet in perfect condition, that I decided stay with that to use in envelopes."
5,HALF BAKED GOODS AND EZ SELL PLEASE READ THIS,I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SHIP THIS TO ME.I JUS FINISHED ORDERING THIS SCALE AND I DONT WANT TO GET THE WRONG ONE.LAST TIME I ORDERED A SCALE THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ONE.PLEASE SEND ME THIS AMERICAN WEIGHT 600g.(blade) digital scale. thank you.....................................
2,"Wrong item sent, you only get 1 not 3","The Rescue Fly trap is good and we've used them for years, but when we came to Amazon to buy refills of the attractant, we found out the hardway Rescue has ""replaced"" this item (shown as a 3 pack) with a new single pack version. This is a out and out scam. The original 3 pack listed sold here for $3.99 to $4.88. But now the same single pack sells for the same $3.99 to $4.88 price. The part numbers are different, FTA-DB18 for the single pack and FTA-DT18 for the 3 pack. This ad shows and references the triple pack, DT18, but you will only get the single pack DB18. Since we can buy the single pak for $2.49 at home depot, it's a waste of money to pay $4-5 for this one."
2,Dont get what you used to.,"This used to be the price for a 3 pack. Now it is the price for ONE. Seems like an error on someones part as you can buy the whole trap, attractant included, for less than one pack of this. Does work well."
5,it works fine,I just started using this product but so far am very happy with it. Seems like it will work out fine in getting rid of the gnats I have in the summer.
4,Rescue attractant,"Have used this product for years with good results. Be careful when disposing of the residue because the odor is nasty (which the flies love). Will continue buying this attractant as long as I have a barn and animals, which should be years. Recommend purchasing product directly from Amazon for a quick, correct order."
2,Just too many flies,We have a fly problem that appears to be bigger than this product can handle. Outside our side door we have a swarm a flies that I bought this product for. At first it seemed to be working however after a few weeks a strong smell started. I had to move it to another location & what I thought was a better location appeared to be worse. Great for catching a few flies but not several.
5,Hawkwind at his best,"One of my favourits Hawkwinds showes.Nick Turner is gone,but their soundis harder,more rockin' than ever (even better than old Lemmy-times stuff)Must for every HAWKWIND fan."
1,Drags on and on.,"I have read numerous book on the Arctic, and this one, by far, is the worst. The reviews I'd read spoke of this sparking a love for the Arctic and inspiring them to learn more about the beauty of the Artic. I'd have to say I can't imagine how they got that. I could barely keep my eyes open trying to read this. The mind-numbing detail with which Lopez describes the latitudinal changes of light and soils and such is simply overbearing and excessive. This book inspired me only to put it down and read something else."
2,unexpected,"when i ordered arctic dreams i thought it would include the european arctic. i am going to svalbard this summer. so it doesn't meet my needs. however, i plan to eventually read it as it talks about other arctic adventures."
5,Arctic Dreams,"A must for the reader who appreciates the beauty of a suttle landscape and the adaptations animals and people make to be at home in such a place. Lopez displays a sort of intelligence and attention to detail in this book that challenges the reader to expand. Having visited the arctic before reading it, I had pictures in my mind that he explained. The local explanation of mountains ""coming up for air"" was breathless. Inuit comfort with that country is so astonishingly beautiful. Having worked for a local ivory sculptor in Anchorage gave me a great curiosity for this land and culture. It took a scientific explanation of the sort Lopez is so go at to feed at least some of that curiosity. If you loved this book, check out some of the works of Inuit art."
5,Indescribably delicious.,"A masterfully woven narrative of the natural and cultural history of the polar regions. If you aspire to enjoy writing skill at its best, it will not disappoint."
4,good prep for travels,"This book was overly 'wordy' at times, but a great read in preparation for traveling in the arctic. It covered the geography, wildlife, peoples, history, and current challenges."
4,Arctic Dreams- a long read but worth it,"Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams may be a long read but it is worth it. Sometimes the language is a little over the top, and the authors personal ideas are interjected a little too much for my liking but the essence of the text and the beautiful scenes that are set up give a new perspective and really make the read worth it. This is a book I had a hard time putting down and picking it up again with ease, sometimes I would have to go back a few pages to remember what I read before so I could continue. This book really gave me new insight and a different way of thinking about the frozen tundra I really don't know a whole lot about, and made me appreciate its beauty in a new way and understand the importance of the landscape."
4,Environmental respect,"Very thoughtful person, providing an understandable basis for protecting the far north. Drags toward the end when it gets quite philosophical."
4,Interesting Volume of personal experiences,"This is an interesting volume of many, many people's personal experiences during the war. The narrative is not exactly gripping, but with patience it can be rewarding. If you're interested in little tid bits of people's memories and brief summaries of their life during the war, this book might be helpful. Though, this book did not meet my expectations based on the glowing reviews given here. I thought it would be more interesting and more in-depth. Many parts are quite boring."
1,"Negative ""cherry pickin'""","I expected a history of the war through eyewitness accounts, but got a collection of cherry picked anecdotes selected to make an anti-war statement. Some of the stories are interesting and revealing of aspects of the time, but this is not a definitive history of WWII by any means."
1,still waiting to recieve book,"i have still not recieved this book, i have been waiting for awhile now. hopefully amazon will check into that for me but all of the other books are very good."
4,Makes you Wonder,"The interviews recorded had some insightful news. Most of the personal history from this era have been lost to my generation, and it was interesting to read the many views of the war. After reading through it really makes one wonder if the war was in fact a ""good"" one."
5,Great stuff!,"This product defines ""a little goes a long way""...Just as a quality concentrated tomato paste should! This is the real deal and has great taste. Ever so much better than canned tomato paste... waste less and use less. Refrigerate after opening and it will last a long time. Unfortunately, many Americans have no idea how to use this product and think it's just expensive tomato paste. NOT. Short of taking a trip to Italy, you can't find better. Buy it, use it and I'm confident you'll agree!Mutti Italian Tomato Paste Concentrate - 4packs"
2,Outdated,"There may be some useful information in this book, but I just couldn't get past the obviously obsolete aspect of it. There are hints on how to most effeciently wash dishes (by hand, in a sink) and statements about how every ""girl"" should know how to make her table look attractive, and advice on lighting a gas stove by hand. I just can't wade through this type of culinary perspective to glean the useful elements. I didn't realize the book would be so outdated or I wouldn't have purchased."
5,15 month old signing 40 signs!,"We began at 9 months and almost gave up. She didn't sign until 13 months , but then exploded almost a sign a day. By 15 months she signed 40 signs. Now 22 months and I quit counting how many she knows. She is talking also and much less frustrated in the process. I found the book very helpful, a quick read, and I would recommend it highly. We are so pleased we taught her to sign. It lowered evreyone's frustration and we beleive made her smarter. I also recommend a web site , Handspeak, an online ASL dictionary for the words that are not in the book."
2,Not what I expected,"It's good for a basic sign dictionary. I thought it would have more suggestions for ways to teach sign to Baby, games and such. Most of the info in the ""how"" part was common sense."
3,A Good Introduction,"This is a fairly good introduction to the world of baby sign language. If you want to know what the benefits are, what to start with and when to start this book is for you. However I would say that if you actually want to learn HOW to sign, the dvd version is much better."
4,Good Resource,I found this very helpful in communicating with my little guy until he fully develops his language skills.
4,Great price,Came within normal dates given was a little disappointed because the whole book was water logged but for what I paid I wasn't going to send it back.
4,book review,Book in excellent condition as stated. Will purchase from this buyer again if need arises.
1,Not that great,"I purchased this book with hopeful expectations to teach my baby to sign. Unfortunately, my baby and I had lessons of frustration. This book is really too centered around ASL signs and does not account for the fact that babies will develop ""Baby Signs"". Just like we don't expect our child to say, ""Bottle"" and happily except ""Ba Ba"" instead, I think it's important to recognize that our babies' motor skills are not always developed enough to gesture the accurate ASL sign. However, another book, which was more helpful to me, was ""Baby Signs"". I think this is gentler approach to baby signing and is better suited to parents who just want a temporary bridge for communication until our babies can talk. BTW, it's interesting that Joseph Garcia has to quote the research of Goodwyn & Acredolo (the authors of Baby Signs). Something to think about...."
3,Good item but you may want to wait a little longer before buying.,I thought this book was very helpful but I purchased it a little too late. My daughter started talking after the age of 2 and as soon as I purchased the book she started to speak. Trying to teach an infant sign language is a little difficult but if you are able to I am sure it is very helpful (especially with temper tantrums when they are trying to communicate but can't).
5,Love It!,I don't have much to say about this book except I love how it is all broken down and really easy to use. My baby is 4 months right now and I didn't know how long it would take me to learn the signs so I started reading it already. My baby still has a couple months before he can start picking up on signs but I will definatly be prepared because the book was so easy to read and refer back to. I hope that if you are interested in teaching your baby signs that you choose this book.
2,A bit disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I expected to learn more. I probably would have benefited more by purchasing an American Sign Language book. It was also very overpriced considering one can get through the entire book within an hour. The concept of teaching your child to speak with their hands is very interesting and I am very excited about trying it with my daughter, but this book is not necessary for that."
3,not sure,"I gave this to a nice janitor at my office, it didn't help him too much but he was very appreciative. He said he listened every night and tried to practice but it didn't help him too much."
1,Couldn't get the described item.,"Amazon had this described as copper core, but I received graphite core TWICE. Nothing wrong with Accel, but Amazon didn't describe the wires correctly and sent the same wrong item the second time. I sent an elaborate explanation of the problem, but the issue was never addressed. It IS a jungle out there."
1,Piece O' poo,I bought this and used it once. Right from the begining I could tell this was a shotty product. I don't know who designed the wringing fuction but it doesn't work in the least. And the removeable cleaning head would not stay attached half the time and I assure you it was inserted correctly. Waste of money!!!
2,Not very absorbent,"I have the newer version of this mop with the lever. At first glance it looks like a great design -- the rollers are flat and squeeze the sponge very tightly. The individual sponge fragments should theoretically give you more working surface and corners.Then they ruined it by putting in some of the least absorbent sponges I have ever seen. Seriously you can put this in a sink and it will float on top for 10 minutes or so without taking on water. You literally have to dunk it and wring/unwring it under the water to get any water out of your bucket.Scrubs great, but unless all you want to do is distribute the filth evenly around the floor, avoid this mop, or bring a second one that can actually get the water back up. But then, what's the point?"
4,The structure of Yiddish,"Vocabulary of the English language consists of several layers, which are not genre-neutral. Stories about Merrie Olde England, such as the Mother Goose nursery rhymes, are heavily Germanic; more formal English writing, such as the United States Declaration of Independence, is heavily Old French; as for modern French borrowings, I am reminded of the Internet forum tagline, ""Pretentious? Moi?"". It was similar with Yiddish: the Germanic, Hebrew-Aramaic and Slavic layers each had their own connotations and could be combined to give expressive richness to a text. Harshav illustrates this with both 19th century Yiddish literature and with the Yiddish poetry of American immigrants. I doubt Harshav's assertion that most Yiddish speakers have always been multilingual, though; Mendele the Book Peddler's Benjamin the Third certainly wasn't."
3,Musicologically fascinating,"This CD is a wonderful listen, but mostly academically. One wishes that Tau Moe had been able to record these songs when he and his wife were much younger. They are lovely songs and I'm grateful that they will be remembered. It's a great CD for a beautiful drive."
2,Not for me.,"Try the Felix Mendelshon CD which is much better than this. There are a few decent tracks on this CD, but overall, the songs sound old, scratchy, and superannuated. Might not be a good buy unless you're into really old, authentic hawaiian songs (original recordings too)."
2,"If Amazon purchased used books, I would try to sell it back.",Most of the material in this book is available online through the Swing Connection and Javasoft Java tutorial.Some of the screenshots in the book show pictures of UI's that weren't even Java JFC.Wiley lost some credibility with me.I would wait/find something else.
2,"Better than nothing, but pretty frustrating...","As I have experienced with most Wiley books, this book is hard to read and hard to use. The examples are trite and uninspired, and do little to illustrate how the concepts can be used in a real application. The diagrams do add little value to the topics and would have looked better if drawn by hand. And the authors' frequent use of their own company's logo in most of the examples is childish and unappreciated.If you are waiting for a good book about JFC and Swing, keep waiting. The Java Series and the O'Reily books should be out soon enough."
3,I would buy this book again,I'm new to Swing and Java. This book provided alot of good examples to get me started with Swing and able to produce working programs quickly. My next book purchases will be books that do a better job describing the details of Swing and Java in general.
3,I would buy it again,There is a lot it barely goes into. Try to figure out how to get ComboBoxModel or data models in general to work by using this book. I am having a lot of difficulty with it.
2,Not for intermediate or advanced users.,Although this book covers all the Swing components it is only good enough for basic users. The examples are too simple to explain any itricacies involved in using the components. Most of the information are better explained in some excellent articles that are available at the Swing Connection. I wish there were better examples specifically for using Internal frames and how to use the property change listeners etc.
5,The heartfelt pang of recognition,"I couldn't put this book down. For a few successive nights, it brought me back to the time I shared with a beloved sister as caregivers, faithful visitors, and advocates for my Dad over the course of the year it took for him to die of stomach cancer. The author hits all the right notes when he writes of caregiver behavior and coping strategies, even humor. The theme of placating and seeking favors from every functionary along the way in Malady rings ever so true. No scheme or pretense is too low when the well-being of a loved one is at stake. I recommend it for anyone about to ride shotgun on the journey through Malady."
5,Good Cable,"As usual Cables To Go produces a low-cost, sturdy cable. I use this in my profession as a tech everyday, so it sees a lot of use. So as much daily stress I put on this thing, including having to get the ends into tight places where the cable is being twisted at almost a 90 degree angle, I highly recommend it. Nice to also have a x-over cable that just isn't boring yellow or gray."
4,"VERY, VERY, SMOOTH","After careful listening I have found this to be one of the most satisfying Cd's I have ever listened to. For Air Traffic Controllers, this is a very masterful work!"
3,VERY ENJOYABLE !,I am an air traffic controller from Oakland and really enjoy this work. Very professional and cleverly done. I am going to see them in concert soon!
3,VERY VERY SMOOTH !,"Nice mix of jazz and new age. It seems to be an all encompassing work of contemporary jazz,using aviation as a thematic background. Cleverly done!"
4,Pleased,"Our local Bible study group chose the book by Dr Charles Stanley,How to Listen to GodAfter ordering five from different sellers, they all came in great shape and we were able to save some money on the total price. Thank you Amazon."
1,"A reader from Richmond, Va.","This book is another example of narrow minded Christian fundamentalism deadening the vital subject of prayer. One would do much better to consider the writings of Thomas Merton, St. John Of the Cross, Henri Nouwen, etc..."
5,ARE YOU LISTENING?,"This book should be the second best book in your library. Charles Stanley teaches us the most valuable lessons any believer would want to know and that is how to listen to God. I was on vacation when I read this book, I couldn't put it down."
5,Life Changing!,"How to listen to GOD, changed my life. By learning to listen to him, I learned to know him. If you read one book this year, read this one. Your life will be dramatically effected!"
4,A Fresh Look...,This book was wonderful. It gave new and practical insight into how we can truly hear from God. Stanley captures scriptural doctrine into every day practices that every Christian can and should implement.
5,An Amazing Book on a Very Difficult Subject,"Charles Stanley delivers an excellent guide for everyday Christians.Deeply rooted in God's Word he explores the Bible and shares personal testimonies on finding out God's will for our life.This is one of the very best books written on this subject... and this subject can actually mean the diferrence between success and failure for a Christian.Get this book, study it, and study the Word of God. Knowing the Word of God, the Bible, is actually one the most accurate ways to know what God thinks about an issue. Charles Stanley adds more insight into areas like, being in peace in your spirit, having good counsel and so much more... in the end if you seek the Lord's will, you will know, but knowing how to pray and where to look for his will will help you in your journey.Five Stars... definitely worth every penny and even more.Jose L. HurtadoToronto / Canada"
3,Inaccurate and poorly edited,"The mapmakers drew the international borders on the map to include the Indian province of Sikkim (which borders directly on Bhutan) as part of China. I'm not sure if this is a careless mistake or reflects some sort of pro-Chinese orientation by the publisher, ITM. China had laid claim to Sikkim until quite recently, but de facto control and de jure sovereignty has been British and then Indian without interruption for at least a century. Furthermore, Chinese maps submitted recently to India include Sikkim within Indian borders, despite still laying claim to parts of India's Arunachal Pradesh state. If the mistake is one of carelessness, it's a pretty major one."
2,Bhutan Map not very useful,"While I have no particular fault to find, I found this map of limited use on my trip to Bhutan, esp compared to the handout maps we got from time to time from our tour guide etc. I dont think I would recommend it to any traveler on a tour group, but perhaps it would be of some use to persons making an off-road trek tour if their leaders were not furnishing their own maps. It's relative lack of relief features meant that it did not give much of an image of what the country would be like in passing through an area."
1,Be afraid... be VERY afraid,"Run, don't walk as far away from this ""film"" as possible. I guess I'm the idiot for actually paying money for what looks like someone's school project. Bad story, bad acting. Just plain bad."
2,Regretful,"So I happen to love queer spec fic. I have a fondness for spooky movies that feature gay characters. But The Sacrifice is no Hellbent.The acting in this movie is atrocious. I never once believe that their was more than a passing attraction between the leads. Their interaction was so stilted and the kiss one of the most tepid I have suffered to watch.This is obviously an amateur production and it shows in the casting, the writing, and the scenery. The very ending was convenient and made little sense as the great powers the lead was supposed to possess never played a major role.I recommend avoiding this one. For a more sultry movie, try a DeCoteau - they may not be truly gay, but at least the quality is immensely better."
5,GREAT CD!,If you love Nat King Cole trio you have got to have this cd.The sound quality is as about as good as I have heard.This is a hard to find cd for that reason.
1,Definitely FREE everywhere on the internet,"This ""book"", properly titled Pounds and Inches: A New Approach to Obesity is definitely free everywhere on the internet. Dr. Simeons has been dead and gone for many, many years. I would expect a little disclaimer or something...is it legal to do this??? It shouldn't be!"
1,waste of time,"I waited 10 days for the supplementals for the HCG diet. I was under the impression this book had hints and different diet levels and food info. Its all facts on obesity, from where it comes from to discrimination. This book is not helping me to stick to the diet, I will be returning it. The internet has more info than this book does."
5,Thank-you!,"Of course this manuscript is available as a PDF online. DUH! Everyone knows that. I've printed it out twice myself--a pile of loose papers that got messed up, lost, and weren't very handy. Sure, I could have paid to have it bound at the copy shop, or bought a binder for the pages, or...for less than the price of lunch out with my girlfriends I can get it here. Now I have a copy that fits in my purse or on my nightstand, is easy to read, and is on hand when I need to refer back to it. I've lost 34 pounds on HCG, and just want Dr. Simeons' own words, not someone else's interpretation of his program. I can make my own decisions. Thank-you, Amazon, for carrying this!"
4,HCG Know How,"I was told to read this book because the detils are from the creator himself- I agree I read others that gave me recipes and such for foods that are not on the diet.I'm sure glad I listened to that advice, doing this diet correctly is key. I am on day 28 and 25lbs lighter. I will put in the effort to see the results and I have never had results this quickly!"
5,HCG Diet,"Pounds & Inches: A New Approach To ObesityThe original manuscript of Dr. A.T.W. Simeons protocol on the HCG diet. I already had a copy I downloaded from the internet, but wanted a more compact edition to carry around. I have begun the protocol and in 5 days on the prescribed diet, I have lost 11 pounds. If you are contemplating this diet, read this book first, as there is a lot to know."
5,Oscar Petersen - smoooooth jazz,"Like the other ""Music for Lovers"" CD's, this music hits it out of the ball park. Smooth, gentle, and mellow.Great to listen to, drink champagne, and do other things.Oscar Petersen is just wonderful to listen to"
3,What about Jacl?,"The guys at O'Reilly have come up with a fairly decent reference for TCL/Tk. It covers a lot of info about the script (core language, various interfaces, and Expect). But, they forgot the most important interface of all: Jacl - the Java interface for TCL. I use this part of the lanuage all of the time. Java is so popular, I don't understand how they could miss such an important feature. It is still a good book, but only 3 stars this time. Maybe they will get it right in the next edition."
3,I thought I could count on O'Reilly,"I usually find O'Reilly books excellent but this one is a disppointment. You could print out the Tcl manual pages and get as much information. Examples are few and meager. There should at least be a brief primer, with examples, to get the reader accustomed to the Tcl way of doing things. There's a tips and hints chapter at the end that's good, but it's all too short."
4,TCL/TK in A Nutshell,"""TCL/TK in A Nutshell"" is an excellent reference book with comprehensive detail. It's not for novices, though. Newcomers to the language should be advised to start with something suited for dummies, and from there to search the Internet for specific explanations and examples."
2,This is not a Tcl book,"I bought this book thinking I would get a good primer/reference book on Tcl. It might be useful for reference, but is almost useless for people new to the language. Out of 440 pages, only 46 are for Tcl and mostly it's a just a brief summary of commands. Think of trying to learn English using only a dictionary. This book is like that dictionary. Also, there are almost no examples on how to use any of the commands."
1,Bad book,"The only book that has disappointed me of this editorial. Do you imagine to learn English with a dictionary?, like it was said previously."
1,The worst programming book I ever bought,"If it was possible to give this book 0 stars I certainly would have. As others have said before, this is just a bad book."
3,Dee Dee does it again. Great Jazz,Dee Dee did a fine job on this Memory of music and Jazz.But she missed my tastes in this.I did enjoy her but it's more contemporary music on here than I prefer.It's great music and Dee Dee is always good.But bring on original Jazz and Blues or old Blues and Jazz and I am much more of a happy camper.....I am a old guy who likes good old Blues and Jazz that I was raised with or that preceded my generation
5,everything went as expected,Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this supplier again. I will most likely order again.Thanks
5,perfume review,This perfume is the best smelling perfume. I have had more men compliment me on the way it smells!I have not changed it in 30 years. Why mess with perfection!
1,This is not the true Anais Anais I've known for 20 years,"I purchased this to my wife as a gift. I have bought Anais-Anais so many times over the past twenty years. It has, or used to have, a soft Jasmin-like smell. What I received was a 3.4oz bottle of Alcohol. Yes, nothing but ugly-smelling alcohol (like in a Hospital room).The box did not even look like the luxury-looking box I am used to. Instead, it looked as if was printed on very cheap recycled paper. Not what you expect when you buy an expensive perfume. I could live with the ugly box, but not the ugly smell.I immediately called Amazon, and here is where they deserve 5 stars. The customer service representative immediately apologized for my dissatisfaction with the product and processed a full refund. I love Amazon and will continue to buy from them with full confidence thatI, either get a quality product, or pay nothing. Long Live Amazon."
5,It is a wonderful and amazing fragrance...,I have used this wonderful fragrance for nearly thirty years. It was introduced tome via my husband's sister. I have a favorite fragrance of my own; this one isnext to it. We are very lucky to have found it on Amazon. What a great price. Icouldn't even try to beat that. We have gone to Bermuda in August of 1983 and whilethere we had purchased it. Thankfully for Amazon. My opinion you cannot go wrong withthis wonderful fragrance. It is so flowing and you feel very pretty. I recommend toanyone with beauty from the inside out. Believe me you will not be disappointed.Make sure to purchase it from Amazon. I received mine in just three days. I wasso elated.
5,Another classic perfume at good price.,This was given as a gift and the price was definitely right for this classic perfume that I could not find in some brick and mortar stores at all. I am not a big fan of scents myself but this one is pretty nice and not over-powering like some of the modern perfumes.
4,"Anais Anais by Cacharel for Women, Eau De Toilette Spray",This is an oldie but goodie. So glad to find it again! It is a delightful classic and made the best gift for a friend you used to wear this but could no longer find it.
4,Love evolves from hope...,"This is a wonderful short novel reminiscent of Grace Livingston Hill, in wording and slightly in topic. Phyllis Braithwate is a ""Liberry Teacher"" (not a typo) - who has worked her way up in the library and has no hope of ever doing anything else. In spite of her living without any probability of a change in her future she is sweet and pleasant to all the patrons she encounters and loves working with the children. She is offered a different future by clients who believe she may be able to help a young man and his mother. Phyllis has just wished for a home and a rose garden, and if necessary a husband that can help her have both. God does answer prayers.....The story was charming and very sweet, problems and resolutions were handled well and the plot was also very good, the only comment, I can make is some of the descriptions of the childrens ethnic background would be viewed as politically incorrect today. If you feel that it will offend you, I would not read this."
4,Dwight is always worth a listen -,"I love this album, I love the movie clip soundbites and the story running through it. I have not seen the film but would like to if it is released in UK.OK some of the songs are not dynamic, but there are some stand out tracks and it makes for a pleasant alternative session. John Mellancamp is excellent and Dwight is as usual superb but the way the soundtrack clips are included is the difference I like."
4,Album Good For a Stupid Movie,I love this album. Don't scare me none is a good honest song. The movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's the reason JM hasn't done anything in the movies since.
2,Not durable,"Very cute, I always get compliments, but I wear them only every so often and the bottoms are all ripped up - you'd think I wear them everyday! I'm just upset I paid over $60 for shoes that will BARELY last one season."
2,"Created for a dance studio, not for walking in the streets of Manhattan","I purchased these about 3 months ago. They have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere. I have been wearing them perhaps 2-3 times a week to the office and home. They are already ripping in the back.I wouldn't recommend them; however, I do get many compliments about how cute they are."
5,Dozens trapped the first day!,"I read some of the reviews from folks who didn't catch anything in these traps. I can only guess that their flying insects are not yellow jackets. I put this up, walked inside, picked up my binoculars to watch, and there were already 3 buzzing the trap. I have to empty it weekly. End of problem for my hummingbirds."
4,Good Trap,"This trap works pretty well, and is easy to operate. The cost of the replacement cartridges is a little steep, and the attractant doesn't seem to last too long (6-8 days), so order/buy extra attractant. If you are only into trapping soldier yellow jackets, it works, Couldn't draw any queens, though. Fun entertainment!"
2,Meh,"One in the back works. The one in the front of the house doesn't. Annoying is the fact that these things don't come with a short spring to hang them with. If you don't have any string around the house, well..."
1,No Way,"I have three in ground yellow jacket nests. Day 1 I put this in a tree 30' from the hives and caught 11 yellow jackets. Since I was counting 40 yellow jackets a minute entering and leaving just one hive, I felt that I should have caught more than 11 in the first day. So I moved it to a tree directly over one of the hives. I let it sit for another day and caught 6 yellow jackets. Ehat a disappointment! This trap does not work and is not worth the money. Buy a different product."
1,Does not work buy something else,I purchased 3 traps and this was one of the three. Out of the three different traps this has caught one and I say one yellowjack in a week. The others have had to be emptied at least once...you do the math.
1,Doesn't work,"I purchased 3 of these traps a week ago and have yet to catch a single hornet, yellowjacket, or wasp. I live in the farm country of north east PA and it seems that these hornets, wasps and yellowjackets make nests everyplace there is an overhang. We have a hard time just sitting around the pool and our patio. I followed the instructions and placed them around according to directions. Also, as recommended in the instructions I baited 1 with just the attractant, 1 with attractant and turkey and 1 with attractant and hummingbird liquid. I still have not caught any, I did catch an ant, and we are still being harrased at pool side. Don't waste your money, I guess spraying is the only way to control them."
2,Does not work as effectivly as advertised,Our yard was infested with Yellow jackets. After installing 6 of these with the better separately sold attractant we watched yellow-jackets fly around these traps for days without having any more then 3 or 4 actually enter the trap. After the full 3 month term of the attractant we used the trap maybe captured 30 to 40 bees out of what we perceived as hundreds flying around.
2,Half Good,"The 'lasts for weeks' attractant lasted (Drum roll, please) LESS THAN 24 HOURS!! When it worked, it worked great. But, right now I think I have paid about $1.00 per wasp. Not what I had in mind. The design is good. You can see if the wasps are dead before you take it apart. I did not trap anything other than yellow jackets. The plastic is fairly rigid. That it doesn't come with a hanger of some sort is a downer. And, because of the design it must hang--you can't set it on something. If, and that is a BIG ""if"", I get some more attractant I am just going to put a drop on the cotton at a time instead of using the whole tube. Hopefully that will work better.Over all--two stars."
1,Does not work,Doesn't work. The attractant is old and useless.I bought the exact same trap from a local store and that one catches yellow jackets just fine.
5,Thank you! This trap saved our summer dining!!,This trap is flawless and brilliant. It works perfectly. The trap cleared up an incessant bee problem around out deck without fail.
1,"The ""Phermone"" did not catch wasps, only these TINY flies","The ""Phermone"" did not catch wasps, only these TINY flies. I am adding the meat and barbque method. So far none caught."
1,Not a single bug went in this thing,I read plenty of good reviews and bought this thing. Its been absolutely useless for me. Think twice before buying.
4,Does work very well,"I wanted to try this for a year before I wrote a review. I get yellow jackets realy bad. I feed my dogs raw meat and this draws the yellow jackets in the summer terribly. I tried many things. The trick is to put it out in very early spring like March or April. this way you have a much better chance of catching queens.Last year after I cought some queens my YJ population went down tremendously. I did still have a few but nothing like before. Then when I thought the season was way over, I went out to get the trap to put away for the winter and it had even more in it! I was not expecting any more because the last time I had looked at it was when I had emptied it and the weather was already cold.The cotton needs to be kept moist so that the attractant works better."
1,Useless Junk,"my green house has predominantly yellow jackets activity. i thought this trap would be a sure killer. nope, i started with half the tube at first, nothing, then i poured the rest in the cotton and left it over the weekend inside, pretty much under their noses. Not a single bee in this trap at all. Washed it and recycled it. Waste of money!"
2,Ineffective,"Location seems to be critical for this trap to work. I've had it mounted in the same location outdoors hanging under a hickory tree for a month. So far have only caught 2 Yellowjackets. I guess it would be more effective if place by a nest, around trash cans, under a fruit tree, etc. wherever Yellowjackets would congregate?"
1,DId not work for me.,It seems others have had good experiences with this product but it did not work for me. It only caught a few yellow jackets.
2,3 nests within a few feet; no wasps or yellowjackets caught,Not a single wasp or yellowjacket caught. And there were three nests within a few feet of this thing. I give it two stars because it is sturdy. But I hope you have different species than I have because the species around here didn't fall for this thing.
1,Rescue Yellowjacket Trap,"Was hoping to get rid of yellowjackets in my mostly grass back yard in Huntington Beach, CA. Followed the instruction and installed this product as directed. After 2 weeks (the amount of time the instructions said the ""bait"" would last) not one yellowjacket was caught. They would fly all around the the area and near the trap but none were attracted enough to go inside. Total waste of money. One star is too high."
3,catches some---not all,"I bought one for my deck where the yellow jackets were bothering the hummingbirds at the feeders. It worked ok.The one caution is that the trap itself comes with a small starter ""attractant"" that doesn't last long. you also need the replacement pack which is a bigger piece that fits inside the trap. It will supposedly last 10 weeks. My other technique was to put a jar lid with sugar water in it to attract the yellow jackets and then squirt them with bug spray. that worked pretty good too and the spray did not get on the feeders."
5,Quick Results!,"Amazing, still can't believe it. I hung it before work and 8 hours later probably had 50 yellow jackets trapped. I was a bit concerned about how they would die, but the sun killed all but a few of the most recent guests so that isn't an issue. Instructions said to hang it 20 feet from the nest but I know I'm much further away than that and it's still drawing them like crazy. Can't believe it's only $12."
3,OK with the Correct Bait,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket. They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away. Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down. They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night. Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets, kill them while they are torpid, and then put it back up. Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
2,Won't work with paper wasps,"My fault. I didn't read the small print. The attractant won't work on paper wasps, which are what is prevalent in my area. And their right. It doesn't. The W-H-Y version says it will work, so I'll be trying one of those. In the meantime, I have put some humming bird feeder liquid in the trap and I'll see if that does the trick. Again, not the traps fault, you just need to aware of the type of wasp's your dealing with."
1,Rescue My Wallet,"Useless, a total waste of money. The wasps laughed at it. Did attract some flies however. So not totally useless."
2,Another Weak 'Mondo Cane' Rip-off You Could Avoid...,"A blatant example of nepotism this time from producer Luciano Martino, director Sergio Martino's brother, who ripped off Sergio's 1969 trash-pic 'Mondo Sex' (AKA 'Naked and Violent', another MYA release you should avoid - read my review), which itself was a 'Mondo Cane' rip-off. Another pseudo-documentary/exploitation vehicle that's just a purile excuse to see a bunch of naked women (and I'm all for naked women) in sexless situations for no apparant reason whatsoever. Forget the X rating too, as there's nothing on display here you can't see these days on satellite at any hour of the day. MYA (an acronym for 'Mislead Your Audience') does it again, recklessly regurgitating poor prints of forgettable films from the past that should've stay buried. Don't say you weren't warned..."
4,at least they try.,This strange movie trying to prove how everything around us goes in a wrong direction. The problem is they dont give us positive ideas plus movie is in Spanish with English subtitles. But this flick has redeeming value presenting really bizarre facts.
5,Gladiator movie...,"Movie was in great condition! Will shop here again! We have enjoyed it several times already! It was very, very, very, very, very good!"
5,excelent,is a classic!!very good product and cheap!very good very good very good very goodvery good excelent !good product! good
3,Doesn't live up to other titles,"I purchased this book because the World of Christopher Columbus was SO good, and this title wasn't available at our local library. As a homeschooling mom and big fan of William Penn and all that he stood for, I thought this would be a good addition to our home library. First of all, the size is smaller. Also the format is different, and there are typographical errors in the book. It does have good info, but definitely not what I was expecting from a Foster book."
4,excellent way to interest 10-year-old in history,"In an easy-to-read style, author outlines the subject's history and, in what she terms ""horizontal history"", provides a most interesting outline of salient events during the subject's time period. This approach provides the reader, youthful or not, with an excellent persective of how historical events influenced the development of William Penn. Fast-moving, interesting text will help the youthful reader to develop an interest in historical subjects."

3,Acceptable....,"I loved this story by Henry James, it was haunting and yet some of its truths are still very much true even in the new millenium. While the film overall is a little dark that I suppose supported the sordid tale that is being told. The characters were portrayed as Henry James wrote them originally. Although I thought the ending was a bit gratuitous."
5,Saddest Drama I've Seen,"For those of you who have loved a person after a relationship (but not during) and wanted that person back but could not get that person back, this film will strong affect you. I have had that kind of relationship, and thus, I could empathize with Merton (sp). Therefore, this was the best drama (and saddest) that I've seen. Five stars!"
5,Exquisitely amazing in every way....,this movie is so beautiful and depressing.. we need more movies like it.
5,Amazing Drama,"I really enjoyed this movie from the very start. It turned into a convoluted tale of class separation and deceit, which destroyed the love of two people. First off, I love London. It was wonderful being transported back into the era of 1910, where hats were just as outrageous as they are today on the heads of English ladies. The second half of the movie was set in Venice, and the scenery and flavor of the location was delicious. Everyone vies for money, and each person is pawn in a game to get what they want. The acting was suburb, the story somewhat predictable, and the ending that leaves you thinking long after the credits are done rolling."
3,excellent until the rather rushed ending,"Wings of the Dove was one of those gems that got lost in the wildly overrated juggernaut that was James Cameron's Titanic. A simple but emotionally complex story of love and betrayal, this film features amazing,poignant perfomances from Allison Elliot and the continuously amazing Helena Bonham Carter. This would have been a perfect film, except for the rather abrupt ending(having not read the original novel, I am not sure who is responsible for it) But despite this flaw, Wings of the Dove was infinitely more romantic and entertaining than Titanic was."
4,WATCHING HELENA SHINE,"About halfway mark,like most HENRY JAMES novels,the story gets a little obvious to be entirely convincing,but along the way here's your chance to enjoy a decent story which profits from a good casting.Saying that HELENA BONHAM-CARTER is ideal in this type of role has become a cliché,but it is so true.Cynic guys who want to watch this to see HELENA naked be patient,you'll get satisfaction near the end.The conclusion has the guy returning to VENISE,which means he won't marry KATE.Between you and me,how can a normal man refuse to marry a georgeous woman like BONHAM-CARTER?After watching this movie, i dreamed that HELENA was my sister and she was conforting me in the morning.Unfortunately,it was only a dream."
1,Uninspired,"British accents, beautiful scenery and period costumes do not make a good movie without quality writing. This film has all the elements of a good Ivory/Merchant production but never seems to put it together."
5,Carter deserved the Oscar for her fantastic performance.,"Helena Bonham Carter is nothing short of brilliant. In my opinion, the lavish sets and the gorgeous costumes alone made this movie worth watching. However, all the characters were well-developed to the extent that your heart was also broken at the end along with the players. Most intriquing story, a different take on the love triangle. Carter conveys the raw emotions so powerfully, her presence so important to the film. I wish she was not overlooked by the Academy. She is a remarkable actress to be sure."
4,Bonham-Carter is Fantastic!,"Helena Bonham-Carter should have won the Oscar for her role in this excellent film. She is supported by a wonderful cast, beautiful costumes and excellent set design. The story of this period piece is complex and has a decidedly dark undertone. A must see for any fan of period films, Merchant-Ivory films and Helena Bonham-Carter!"
3,ELEGANT BUT UNINSPIRED,"The Wings of the Dove has a great scene towards the end where the two lover make love. Its sex without love or even lust but soaked in guilt and self loathing. It is a morosely erotic scene. Unfortunatley the rest of the film doesn't match that level of intensity, but is a rather mechanical exercise in love-triangle drama. This is strange as director (Iain Sofetly) of Backbeat tries to break all genre conventions with kinetic camera work and Helena Bonham Carter gives a wonderful performance rich with lust, selfishness and guilt. Its rather inexplicapable then that the film never truly reaches a take off point or a level of emotional involvment as for example a slow burner like Merchant Ivory's Howards End and certainly not even in the vicinity of their masterful The Remains of The Day. No this is more similar to MerchantIvory's 1986 film A Room With A View, also an elegant film, also starring Carter that similarly fails to engage on an emotional level."
3,Chick flick,"Yes, this should be dismissed as a ""chick flick,"" for that is indeed what it is. A three hankie, extremely long soap opera. The costumes and sets are excellent, and the acting is fine. The scenes taken in Venice are largely wasted, however, as they appear on screen for only seconds. The steamy sex scene near the film's conclusion shows conclusively that Helena Bonham Carter can act! On the whole, this is an irritating waste of time."
1,good actors lousy movie,"to put it very simply, there was a lot of reading in between the lines,plot was not good...boring to me.....will never watch again."
4,Watch - don't listen,"This movie is a tasty eye candy. The plot is awkward at best. The original novel is not much better, by the way. I am surprised that a sophisticated author like Henry James wrote this novel. I have always considered him a great psychologist, who posessed great insight into human motives, but in this particular novel his usually precise psychoanalysis goes in every direction uncontrollably. The plot reminds me of a high-school revenge thriller. I wonder if he was influenced by Chorderlo Laclos' ""Dangerous Liaisons"". Turn down the sound, so you don't have to bore yourself with the tedious dialogue, and enjoy the splendid costumes and the steamy sex scenes."
3,Outdated,"The book was really easy to read and understand. I practiced the tests using the enclosed CD-ROM and was passing every test with 80%-90%. However, when I took the test so many questions seemed foreign. I barely passed with a 70%. I don't know if the test has been updated or the material in this book was outdated?"
5,Great Book,"This book helped so much. The CD was great. The adaptive portion of the CD really prepared me for the real exam. The content is very easy to comprehend, the questions before the chapter help you to evaluate how much time you need to spend on that particular chapter. The questions at the end really help you narrow in on the individual sections. I used 3 other study materials but kept coming back to this book for all the information I needed. I recommended this book to all my friends that are about to take the test too! Great Book!"
1,Use This Book for a Door Stop,"I purchased this book to use as a reference. I had hoped it would be friendlier & perhaps a little more intelligent than MS documentation. This book simply cannot be called complete and the authors do a poor job of anticipating the sorts of question one might ask when working with VS6 on a day-to-day basis. I haven't investigated other books on VS6 but with this in mind, it seems to me that almost any other book on the subject is likely to be better."
4,"Scrumptous, flavorful and easy!","We bought this book a few years ago, each time I reach for it and try a new recipe I have not been disappointed! I love the steamed fish with lemongrass and the southern chicken curry even pleased my teenagers. Prep time is fairly minimal if you stock most ingredients, and I find it easier to use store bought red or green curry paste. I'm a novice at Thai cooking, this book makes it tasty and easy!"
1,Authentic Thai Cuisine? I Don't Think So.,"Okay, now I bought this Thai cookbook because it had great pictures and all the recipes sounded simple and easy to follow. I should've checked it out at the library before buying because I was completely dissappointed. I made a salad, a soup and a stirfry. I followed the recipe and it came out as if I'd added a bottle of salt water to the mixture. Many of these recipes combine fish sauce and soy sauce which makes it really salty. Thai cooking is not supposed to use much soy sauce. The only thing that turned out was the rice. So unless you are extremely lacking in rice-making abilities I would not recommend this book at all. Get Real Thai by Nancie McDermott."
5,Real evil,The rating does not indicate a 'liking' for this book - it indicates it is a book everyone should read. The author's daughter translated the original manuscript into English and she told me she had nightmares for years afterward. I believe it.Books about the Holocaust and Russian Gulags describe similar horrors but we were complicit in this along with the British.
4,"Winning small film, bleak but engaging","3.8 starsI enjoy the Film Movement concept, and this is another small, low-budget movie worth a view for fans of this sort of coming of age flick. The two leads are solid, the film shot in pleasingly grainy black and white until near the end, and it's a sleek 70 minutes. The story and locale are both pretty bleak, featuring council block flats and that sort of Dickensian feel that London delivers so well. But there are rays of light, not only in the central friendship but, somewhat uniquely, in the single father and his son's connection, which is both realistic and free from the standard tropes. No beatings or abuse, just two guys trying to understand each other with respect. Very nice.Some decent humor, plenty of quiet irony, and an oddly pleasant dour feel make this worth watching for fans of smaller, mellow character studies."
3,Not All That Great,"I read the rave reviews, so I thought I'd add this movie to my collection. It was a waste of time for me. I always do something with my hands while watching TV, such as needlepoint or knitting, so I don't like movies that require my eyes on the screen at all times. This movie does have some sub-titles especially in the beginning, and you have to pay attention to them or lose the storyline.Worse than that, I found the English boy's accent very difficult to understand. The Polish boy was easier to understand, but his speech was very soft. On top of language issues and volume problems, I wasn't endeared to the story. Period. The only aspect I didn't have a problem with was the B&W; vs color. It was not a horrid story and the production was good enough, so I gave it 3 stars."
4,Very well written,"For someone who is looking to learn about a strange phenomenon that has interested many people including myself, then this is the book. The author gives a very complete factual account of how the different cultures have embraced the idea of the after life. My favorite aspect of the book is how the author brings together the fact that the religious establishments have used the notion of hell as a very influential tool throughout history. Overall, the book is great and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,The history of Hell,"This book is not for those who are not secure in their religion or have a hard time dealing with facts. This book is incredible and even made me question myself and whether my faith was what I thought it was. I had to question whether I was still a Christian at the end od this book. However I still enjoyed reading this book, it made me a spiritually stronger Christian, I don't believe this was the purpose of this book that is just how I feel. In closing i would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the ideas of other religions and cultures or where there own ideas come from."
5,Very historical and very hellish,"I totally forgot that I bought this book from Amazon. Then I saw it and realized, ""oh yeah. If I bought this in an actual bookstore, my parents would find out!!!!"" Actually, I accidentally gave this review 5 stars when I should have given it 1. There is far too much hell as history and far too little (read: none) recipes on demon-summoning. I got around this by dressing up my little brother as the devil and smearing him with pig's blood, but the effect was not the same.Only buy this if you're the nerdy kind of evil goth. I'm not."
5,A wonderful book about the netherworld,"I am still reading this book. I love it so far. I have been looking for something that went deep into ancient cultures beliefs on the afterlife and how they compare to that of Christianity. She does a great job of showing how the different ancient cultures borowed and mixed their mythology and how it has affected Christianity. I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not having to look differently at their faith. There are so many similarities between these ancient ""myths"" and our Christian ""truths"". I highly recommend it."
4,Hella Good,"As a religion major, hell is one of my favorite subjects. I chose this book at random off the shelve & was quite happy that I did. A book about Hell for a gift idea or displaying it on your coffee table for guests might be a bit morbid for some people. However this book is more about Hell's history & its effect on our entire way of life. It's informative, up-to-date, well written & laid out, and has dozens of good points to make. The only thing I wish it included is the concept of Hell surrounding the East/Asia--this book focuses strictly on religions in the Western world."
4,Well Constructed.,"I really like this table and chairs set, however I find it a bit to large for my tiny 14 month old daughter. It is wonderful though and will be a great place for her to do crafts and such when she is a bit bigger. Lipper does have a few that are smaller in scale and size if you are looking for something smaller."
4,FUSION 3 Bible still useful for later versions,"Okay... the NetObjects' folks comes out with new versions of their very good program Fusion before help books can be written. I'm currently using v5.0.1, and still find Hague's very book useful. If you bought v4.0 of Fusion, this book is _so_ much more helpful than the documentation that came with that version. There isn't much out there in terms of other help texts (the ...FOR DUMMIES text for FUSION is very subpar), so this seems to be one of the few alternatives to the packaged documentation. Let's hope Mr. Hague has a follow-up planned, because he writes well, and coincidentally is very helpful if you post him an e-mail asking for more insight. Even with the improvements with each successive version of the program, there is still plenty of similarity with FUSION 3, and the rest you'd probably be able to figure out on your own."
3,Fusion 3 Bible,"I think this book is just only a better revised version of the manual and it is (no doubt) helpful for the beginners, but when you think of Bible you need something more. The chapter for using rich media is very simple and sometimes confuse and is limited to describe what a rich media is, and not the real implementation with the programm leaving out some important details."
3,Great Book For Beginner to Intermediate,"This is a good book for those wanting to learn Fusion 3.0. It completely covers navigating the menus and what each option is used for. The book does not contain anything that I would call ""advanced"". The book lacks in any tips on potential bugs (even though many exist). I agree that the ""advanced"" portion of the book is a lot of hype."
3,"OK, but where's the Fusion 4 version?",If you have Fusion 4 this book is helpful but also frustrating. When do we get an upgrade because the manufacturers of the programme have no idea.
1,Like a deaf man teaching music ...,"Being a religious man myself, I took the descriptive attributes of a 'bible' into account when I chose to buy this book. However I assume the that the author (David Hague) is an aethiest since he seems to attribute the terms 'inaccurate' and 'vague' to a bible.I friend of mine contracted David Hague to do some IT work for his small/medium business, and from what I've been told, this guy (David) shouldn't even be working in IT, let alone authoring a book on IT. From the assumption I gained from using this book, I tend to agree with him.Stay clear of this book, there a better options. It is very vague, and is relatively useless to both beginners and experienced IT professionals."
1,What are the song titles and artists on this cd?,I think Amazon should list the songs and artist are on this cd. This is no information about it. How can it be rated
4,4 star rating not up to his 77-99 cds missing a few beats,"4 star cd not up to par with his 77-99 cds. not like his vol 1 7 2 Trio cds that is. George Bretzlafff 46 yrs old big fans of his david benoits, bob james, peter white & others grover wasshington jr,s to."
4,Battlestar Galactica Series DVD to be released,"Yes it's true. Although Amazon may not be aware pf it yet, Universal Home video has announced on its web page that the entire series of Battlestar Galactica will finally be released in a special multi disc set sometime in October. It is not specific as to which version of the pilot will be on it but one could only hope it will be the same version that was presented on TV in 1978, not the 1979 movie version released on video. The releasse coincides with both the 25th anniversary of the show as well as to promote the new mini series on SCI-FI this Christmas. Also to be re-released is the Widescreen DVD. No details as yet but hopefully it will includemore features than the 1999 release that had very few features. A true 5.1 Dollby Digital and/or DTS sremix would be nice, isolated soundtrack, and perhaps the trailer and/or TV spots...Hope this helps. Its about time."
5,Awesome,The whole family sat and watched all the episodes over a weeks time. It was nice to be able to watch something that was for all ages. My 3 and [...] loved the shows as much as me and my husband.
3,A Great DVD Package...BUT,"I only have one complaint about this box set, and it isn't about the acting or the haircuts of the actors. It's about the picture quality. I was really hoping it would be digitally-remastered - like the packaging promised. But from what I've seen so far, the prints are quite grainy and dirty. It's almost as bad as watching it on TV! That said, it's an excellent set - a beautiful box, collector's booklet, and great extras. Too bad Universal cheaped out on the part that counts."
4,Good Collection,"I grew up on the original Battlestar Galactica. I couldn't really get into the new one on ScyFy. This collection is very good. Because the show is great, I'm giving it a four star. Disk 4 and 5, while they look like they are two sided, the second side is blank. There is nothing missing on the disc, the sides are just blank. Disc 3 side 2 has a one hour episode. This could have been done in 4 double-sided disks. The way the disc are placed in the casing does provide some extra protection, but double sided disc tend to scratch. Disk 5 stopped playing a few times."
5,More fun and campy than the new version,The original Battlestar:Galactica is much more fun and campy than the dark new version everyone is talking about. Apollo and Starbuck are great friends and the adventures are more fun to go on. Dirk Benedict is perfect as Starbuck and to me makes the show worth watching again. He also makes an appearance in Galactica 1980 for one episode which makes that set worth owning too.
5,Wonderful,"Great series, great job on the DVD. My only gripe (petty) is that there isn't some commentary on the series episodes as well. I really enjoyed the commentary by Hatch and co. on the pilot."
4,Overall BG is a Nice Set,"OK. I was 16 when this show was on ABC and loved it, so I have some bias about it's quality now. However, my 12-year-old son is just learning about it and he loves it! Anyway, the set overall is very nice. (I'm just going to need to buy a photo rack to display this box.) The sound is wonderful - very clear and in stereo. The picture is sharp. All of the outakes are fun to watch. We've just started going through them all, but have been satisfied with the set so far. Only disappointment is it appears they did not include the trailers for each upcoming episode. A little thing, but seeing what was on the next week was part of the experience back when it was on network TV. If you were a fan, you should buy it and relive some of the memories with a new generation. By your command."
4,Re: Cy??,"The episode presumed missing, the one with starbuck and a cylon, is from GALACTICA 1980 that's why its not in the box set."
4,Great Series,If you liked the original series this is the DVD to own. The deleted scene extras are fun to watch after the episode.DVD picture and sound quality is good.
1,Quality of DVD stincks,"I love the original series but feel cheeted. There were episodes that I remember that were not included. Mostly though the quality control in these DVD's is realy bad. My father owns a set, and he returned several sets before he got one that is mostly good. My set was good all the way through until the last disc. I have not returned it for fear that I'll get an even worse set.One of the things they did that I hate is they recorded on both sides of each disc, so if you get a bad one, a lot of episodes are potentially messed up."
3,"Well, almost...","This was a bit disappointing. I loved the series when it was out originally and even saw the ""pilot"" when it came out theatrically. One of the great parts was the SOUND. How come the wonderful L.A. Philharmonic fabulous soundtrack sounds so ""tinny"" and bland? Plus, when it came thru the theaters in was one of the first ""Surround Sound"" mixes, EVER!?! I can't understand how that didn't translate to DVD. And who cares about the Cylon head box, anyway, I'd rather have ALL the episodes, not just the first season. What's up with that? I recall several dealing with their arrival at earth. Also, I recall one with Starbuck being standed with a Cylon (ala ""Enemy Mine"") that was quite good. The ones at earth weren't that great, but the were interesting. I gave 3 stars just because it was great in it's own time and still worth buying now."
2,"A great 70's Sci-fi series, finally comes out on DVD.","This has to be my all time favorite television series. As a kid, I would wildly wait until Sunday evening, knowing far well that my 7th grade classes are just a few hours away. As well, closing upon, 8 - 9:00 depending on the episode, I would anguish at the closing credits. But now I can see the entire series even though it's definately dated, especially considering Star Trek: The Next Generation series. The series contains everything that a guy likes: action, romance -- especially consider Starbuck and Athena or Cassie. There is just one other point I must mention in regret about the series, its overt Mormon theology. It's about .... Time Universal Studios releases this series on DVD, Now, they have to do the same with with the Buck Rogers series. But by far, Nothing will ever come close to the original BsG Series."
1,Not a complete series,"Missing the episodes where Galactica finally reaches Earth. I was waiting for those and then after the ""Hand of God"" it just ends. Bohoo!"
5,EXCELLENT,"Finally, what the fans want. This is as close as the REAL fans of the series will get when Sci-Fi releases the version that is ridiculous in December. 3 hours of deleted scenes is what did it for me. Wow, does this really enhance the series! Scenes make more sense, things are more logical, its good clean fun! And the documentaries and commentary by Dirk Benedict, Richard Hatch and Herb Jefferson Jr. are great. Take it from me. I was the editor of a fanzine - THE KOBOL CHRONICLES - when I was a kid. THIS is what the fans want and is the best release of a dvd collection for a tv series I ever saw so far, including STAR TRREK, MASH, CHEERS...you name it. This one has class and style. You wont be disappointed...even by Apollo and Starbuck's hair! My advice? This is the BG to watch - not the one on Sci-Fi."
4,My 8 Yr old enjoys BattleStar Gallactica,"I purchased this for my 8 year old son because I enjoyed it years ago when I was young and the show was on television. My son appears to enjoy it very much; especially, the battle scenes with the Viper fighter ships versus the Cylon ships flown by Centurion robots. As for me, I can see why the series did not make it for very long; it could have been a very good series if not for some of the poorly written episodes and silly looking characters. Plus, I don't believe the writers put much thought into where to go with the story upon finally reaching earth. Anyway, it is worth the small amount of dollars in order to provide hours of entertainment for the young ones.Of course, I didn't like the old Star Treks; yet, I did watch the Lost In Space episodes as a kid. So ...., who am I to judge."
4,Anyone remember this episdoe?,I'm pretty sure it's from Battlestar Galactica. I watched this episode while i was a kid. The whole Battlestar Galactica crews found Earth except it's still in the 1980's technology. I believe the story took place in New York. Anyone remember this episode? Am i hallucinating or does this epsidoe actually exist. Please provide me the name of this episode/movie so i can finish watching its entirity. Thanks[...]
3,DVD packaging tight to handle. Careful or damage will occur.,"The package is quite nice and laid out well. The dvd's however are packed very tight and if care is not taken removing them, the possibility of breaking them or cracking is great.I learned the hard way on the first dvd I removed where one side cracked and is not playable. Be aware of the 2 sided dvd even though the dvd menu warns you of this."
4,Battlestar Galactica,This was a good show. The DVD was in good shape. There were one or two places where it stopped but not enough to see the story. I would probably buy from this vendor again
3,"$65 for one season, way overpriced. It was a good show though. Have not bought due to price.","I give it just 3 stars due to the high price for just one season. The show was really good, though the production values do not hold up to today's standards, but what does from that time period. Nothing from the 70's really compares. I have not bought this set. If it had a reasonable price I would."
4,BY YOUR COMMAND!,"Forget the ""modern"" Battlestar Galactica series! The ORIGINAL BSG RULES!You'll love John Colicos as ""Baltar""...he really chews up the scenery."
4,Battlestar,"This was ordered for my nephew who is disabled and boy has he enjoyed it. He was so surprised when he got it. He thought he was getting a box with DVDs in it. The case was in great shape, even had dust to go with my nephews dacore! The DVDs were in great shape too."
5,Real Battlestar goes DVD just as New Show Destroys Fanbase,"Its about time they put the ""REAL"" battlestar into the hands of fans who have had to suffer thru the incomplete video tape versions. Now we can all watch the Original actors do what they do best - and we can enjoy the way battlestar was meant to be seen. Its also perfect timing too..now that they are remaking the show to ""STAR TREK LITE"", we fans can now pop in the dvds and watch them instead of trying to sit thru the new ill-fated remake. My only question, why did it take so long? - Anyhow we will be treated to the entire run of ONE YEAR... Hopefully the extras will make up for the high price tag..."
2,"Great Show, just missing a disk","The product is awesome, I loved the old Battlestar Gallacitca series, but I paid for a full set of disks and was missing one."
1,Packaging,It was a great show!I wont even consider buying though until packaging normal like other dvds.Just keep it regular boxes please.
2,A Sinking Ship,"This was a gift for my son, who was quite disappointed. It was not what he expected and more than l dvd was damaged. We had to return it."
2,Interesting look back at what we liked in the 70s,But doesn't hold up very well against contemporary competition.
5,it's about time!!,"I have been waiting for this to come out for a long time.As a kid, i couldn't wait for the show to come on, and as a adult i look forward to getting a blast from the past.My children even enjoy it almost as much as i did at their age.But,appollo and starbuck, you still look as good now as you did then..."
5,Battlestar glactica,"I think this is the best series of this type as to when it was done, the moral message presented and just plain entertaining. Contrary to the new version, which is amoral, and reversies positions of men and women. I do not like the new version and believe it should be removed from the airwaves."
5,cool package,I love the helmet packaging. Who doesn't love the old adventures of Starbuck and Apollo!
5,wow!,i just got around to getting this and let me tell you: THIS SET IS SWEET! nice job! kudos to all who were involved in putting this together.
5,Epic Galactica,Grew up with one of the best TV sci-fi shows ever. It's amazing to have all the episodes on hand. The battle scenes look very good for a show shot over 30the years ago sans CGI!
3,Battlestar Galactica,"I purchased this series because I had watched it as a child. It is not quite Star Trek, and I was expecting there to be more Cylon action.But it was a nice walk down Memory Lane."
2,"Loved the series, hate the quality of the set","I was so psyched when I heard BG was coming out on DVD and was at Best Buy the day it came out. However, as I started watching the series, I had problems with a few of the disks. The sound and picture would get all screwed up and would finally just stop playing. My DVD player is new so I knew it couldn't be that. So, I returned it to Best Buy and got a new copy. SAME PROBLEM!!! I was so frustrated that I finally just asked for my money back.It's too bad because I really loved this series. I just wish Universal could have put together a better quality set."
5,This one Rocks :P,"I have Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Epic Series Limited Edition Cylon Head Packaging,'tis a great Series you gotta give it a try :P"
5,A must for a true fan,"This is of course for the Battlestar Galactica fan. Even with the extras, just having all the episodes on DVD is awesome!! Been waiting for this for some time, pre-ordered over nine months ago!!"
4,A Classic on DVD,"Finally one of my favorite shows has made its way to DVD. I can remember watching Battlestar Galactica reruns many years ago on saturday afternoons along with Buck Rogers and Star Trek. The cylons are some of the best cyborgs to appear in all science fiction. If you enjoy classic, nostalgic science fiction I recommend that you buy this boxed set"
4,The Big Ponderosa in the Sky,"It is amazing that -- like KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER -- a one season show is fondly remembered. I saw this when it originally aired. The three hour opening pilot was a ratings winner but successive episodes slipped to the point where the cost of the show (at the time the most expensive in tv history) sealed its doom. Still, it is a fun show and if you don't expect a lot, it is entertaining. Richard Hatch (off his stint as Michael Douglas' replacement on THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO ) as Captain Apollo, Dirk Benedict as his hot-shot buddy Starbuck (a tv Han Solo) and Lorne Greene as Commander Adama. It is fun. I found it amazing that it was reimagined. When I first heard about those plans my thought was: ""What the f**k?"" But that series turned out well -- well the last episode is, well, preachy. Another such ""reimagining"" is on the way with AMC's THE PRISONER."
1,A very disappointing series.,"When this show first aired,I would turn it on in hope of a good story and switch it off in disgust.The show is produced by America's worst producer in Glen Larson,a man that had no idea of story and so it goes for this show which has terrible writing.Most episodes start with the same basic scene of a Galactica pilot battling and blowing up a Cylon ship with the very same effects every time.To show how confused the writing was,the human villian that collaborated with the Cylons and was killed of in the premiere episode suddenly was brought back alive as a regular villian. Then after this series was cancelled,it was revived as Galactica 1980 and became.... a comedy.Buy Star Trek or Babylon 5 instead,at least they are well scripted and well produced."
1,Terrible,"Possibly one of the worst television shows ever created, this series totally destroys any quality its amazing premise had with horrible plotting and dialogue, and acting that was even worse. Rightfully cancelled mid-way into its second (even worse) season, ""Galactica"" somehow found its own little niche audience.Like any other series created by Glen Larson, it has a great premise, but can't get anything else right. The characters are poorly drawn, swaggering fools, and the Cylons are even worse. They're slow-moving, dullards of machines. It's a wonder even the foolish crew of the Galactica and its rag-tag fleet were able to defeat them so readily EVERY TIME they go into combat.Avoid this set, unless you're REALLY into watching bad TV and movies. This belongs on the same shelf with movies starring the likes of Steven Seagal and Freddie Prinze Jr."
4,Great 70's sci-fi series...,"What can I say? I'm a sucker for good campy space movies/series. It doesn't hold a candle to Star Wars, but I can't help but watch. Some of the acting is only decent but much of that is probably due to the script. The show is horribly dated, but the plot itself makes sense and is believable. The special effects are great considering the time period and the budget it probably had. Definitely worth a watch if you have the time, if anything just for the hairdo's and 70's style outfits."
3,Great show with not so great packaging.,"I haven't seen BSG since I was a kid. It's the kind of SCI FI I grew up on and wanted a chance to see where the new version was coming from as an adult. By the way I absolutely love the 2004 version, too. The 70s BSG is still a great show albeit funnier than I remember. Gotta love what could be done before the age technology and special effects. The show is excellent and timeless but the pacakging could use some rethinking. I can't give the show a well deserved 5 starts because I'm sitting here with two cracked disks. The locks holding the disks in place wouldn't release."
5,Classic,Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was so thrilled to get the complete series to one of his favorites
4,A Keeper!,"I remember watching this TV series when I was younger and this is just one of many series which I am collecting. So far, so good!"
5,Nostalgic,"Loved the show when it was on t.v (30 yrs ago?) Watching it in its entirety, over a months time, is great"
3,EXCELLENT! (Except for...),"The ONLY thing wrong with this impressive and awesome collection of the TRUE Battlestar Galactica (unlike it's modern-age imitator and pretender), is that it is on double-sided DVD's, which is a very poor way of burning DVD's, as they must be flipped to watch the other side. In certain carousel-based DVD players such as the one I have (a 400-disc Blu-Ray/DVD changer), they do not remove easily enough to flip, so this makes it very inconvenient. All that aside however, long live the ORIGINAL and ONLY TRUE Battlestar Galactica series!!!!!"
4,Battlestar Galactica- The Complete Epic Series,"I give this one 4 stars because, although it is nice to have the whole series on DVD, the picture (particularly the dark shades) tend to be grainy, and the package is susceptable to easy damage. The vac-formed Cylon helmet had three dents in it before I even got it home! If you do buy this, watch the pilot with commentary on- It's pretty entertaining! I laughed a few times! Anyway, if you liked the show, it's worth it. The extras are a nice addition. On the whole, just to have these on DVD makes it worth it. Unfortunately lasted only one season, but we all know that it cost something like 1 million per episode back then. Why would a studio spend that when you can air stupid sitcoms for very little money. A fun series...let's hope the new one isn't as bad as people are presuming it to be..."
4,A talented new artist on the rise...,"This is an excellent disc from start to finish. Emotional lyrics, wonderful synth sounds, a bit of guitar here and there, and an incredible voice to guide you along through eleven amazing songs. Well worth picking up... I hope to hear more from John in the near future!"
1,what the,Dont believe some of the reviews you read. I bought this because I read a couple of reviews. No offence to this blue audio guy hes probably a nice guy. This was the worst album Ive ever bought. Lets not lump everything with keyboards into the same genre as depeche omd Iris de/vision please.
5,Superlative treatment on a neglected topic,"This is probably the first and best treatment on the visual representation of the tribes on Papua New Guinea.Books on ethnography always tend to be dry academic studies. This book deals with several tribes living on Mt Hagen, and their basis and preparation for putting on their finery for an annual Sing-Sing festival. The excellent photos and illustrations complement the fine text. I bought this 2nd hand and it is a treasure."
1,no book--no review,The book was scheduled to arrive in late April and it is now early May and no book. Hence a very negative review.
4,The Gilbert Affair,"Paul and Steve work their usual magic trying to free a convicted man. They believe in his innocence and through car crashes and danger and a party at the end with a twist, Gilbert is freed. I enjoy the radio programs which I think are beautifully done with just about perfect sound effects."
1,"Ohhh, Jilly, Jilly, Jilly","I await each Jilly Cooper book with great excitement. I love the pure escapism of her too good/too bad to be true characters. I love her witty turn of phrase. It takes a lot to get me to laugh out loud and she has accomplished it before. . .not this time however. I actually forgot, several times, I was reading this book--it was boring, the characters annoying and the premise unoriginal. I strongly recommend you not waste your time--go back and review Rupert/Billy the early days."
3,A Major Disappoiontment,"As a long-time fan of Jilly Cooper's, I eagerly await each new effort. Pandora does not live up tp its predecessors at all. I found the book lacked the wit which abounds in her other novels; the chief problem in the novel is not the recovery of stolen art work, but the attempts of several characters(none of whom is very memorable) to carry on romance while avoiding incest! Many problems are left hanging, too many loose ends are not tidied up.Better luck next time!"
1,Same 2001 edition not a 2002 edition.,I bought this book again because I own the 2001 edition and thought this was an update for 2002. It is not an update for 2002 and is just the same book. The publishers should correct this error so that other readers do not buy the same book twice. My copy is being sent back to Amazon.ca
1,Price,The Cervantes site is offering this book for $14.00. How come sellerswant to sell this book with over $60.00 priceIndoor Marijuana Horticulture - The Indoor Bible (Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor/Outdoor Medical Grower's Bible)
1,To be avoided,"If you are a begginer looking for information on growing MJ or a more experienced grower requiring ideas then you will do very well to avoid this book. The material is poorly laid out, is often confusing as it is littered with spelling mistakes and seems to have been done in a slap dash manner [...] lots of ideas and details on hydroponic cultivation are very dated and would seem to date back to the late 1970's.[...]"
4,Excellent book for all levels of growers,This is an excellent book. Jorge covers all aspects of indoor growing. The book includes amazing color pictures and step by step instructions on overcoming all growing problems. His strain and seed guideline is also a very useful feature. This book truley covers it from A- Z. It is highly recoomended by the people on http://www.beeshive.org/ and that states a lot!
3,it's an OK guide BUT,"okay all the typos and grammatical errors got to me too. this book has a lot of good information BUT I too, found incorrect information. Cervantes also contradicts himself a lot because in his articles in high times grow magazine, he says things that are total opposites from the book. i prefer his articles to this book BUT it did have some information that i found helpful. there has to be better stuff out there though."
4,"Great, but could have been better","Jorge covers everything you want to know about indoor marijuana growing, only there are frequent errors and contradicting statements. It also could have been better organized, but its vast supply of info makes up for these shortcummings."
5,Jorge knows whats up!,"People ask me all the time to recommend a grow book. Without fail, I always point to Mr. Cervantes work. He has been a respectable icon in the cannabis world for many years, and really knows his stuff.Jason King,Author: The Cannabiblewww.thecannabible.com"
3,Good Introduction for a first timer,"This is a good and understandable introduction to triathlon and nothing more. The workouts got me through my first one with a pretty respectible time but if you are looking for more info, other books such as Triathlon 101 are a better bet. In defense of this book, I don't believe it was written to be more than an introduction to the sport. Good workouts in the back."
3,Basics - for your first tri,"If you are training for your first triathlon, and/or you think you might only do one triathlon and don't want to invest too much money, this book might do it for you. It has basics on everything from work-out schedules to weight training to nutrition. It was okay for what I wanted at the time and the price, but I wish I would of invested a book that will help me more in the future. It was an easy read, I read most of it on my lunch hour one day. It was a comfort to have and help me visualize what the race would be like."
2,NOT an Ironman training guide,"I bought this book because It looked like a book that was designed for the first time Ironman runner. The title ""Starting Out Triathlon: Training for Your First Competition (Ironman Edition)"" is very misleading. It appears to be a good trainig book for other triathlon distances like a sprint or Olympic, but it does not touch on the Ironman distance at all.I am returning it."
3,Interesting,"Carlin's a thoughful guy, and gives a great run down on what he thinks about comedy.The quality of the audio is a bit ordinary (it was recorded in Carlin's dressing room), but the insights are good.Still, only worth a listen through - not really something to keep coming back to repeatedly."
1,Lousy Book,"This book could have been written on ONE page! All he really says is that a migraine starts in the stomach, acid causes the migraine, use bread to soak up the acid, take tylenol, avoid food triggers...there, all better! The advice he gives on the dosage of tylenol could actually be a problem for your liver. Dangerous advice! Don't waste your money on this one! I did...."
2,Disappointing. Please keep having at it.,"We enjoy 'Fire' and 'Senor Smoke,' immensely, and were really looking forward to 'Switzerland.' Found the album a disappointment, for it hasn't the verve, vim nor vigour of its predecessors. Felt like we wasted our money buying it on faith; could almost hear E6 saying (à la Laurie Anderson): ""Ha ha ha - you've already paid for this""). First learnt of E6 from seeing the ""Gay Bar"" video on Sundance Channel's regrettably short-lived Sonic Videos programme, and thought their humour and rockin' sound was freshly dynamic. Maybe we shall develop an appreciation for 'Switzerland' after later listens-to but haven't yet. Here's hoping that, despite this weak album, they press on and regain what was lost here. Solid new rock bands are far and few between these days, and we are hoping that E6 is still going to be one of them."
2,Electric Six's low point,"""Switzerland"" lost the hooks and rock and roll swagger of Electric Six's previous two albums and replaced it with a blend of styles. Unfortunately, attempts at humor seem to overtake the experimentation, making the album sound like a joke that's not all that funny. ""I Buy the Drugs"" is still quite catchy and is a preview of good things to come on future releases, and ""Pulling the Plug on the Party"" could have been right at home on ""Senor Smoke"". ""Night Vision"" is another standout, but still pales in comparison to some of E6's better music. Outside of those three, I can't recommend too much here."
3,A good read that moves from now -to historical-and back.,"Crigger has hit on a theme that intrigued me: when the gunsmith, a girl, touches an antique gun she is transported back in time and becomes the person who handled the gun. Crigger's imagination has no bounds as I went with Boothany back to Georgian England and barely couldn't stop reading until she was safely back in her gunshop. Crigger's style is almost tongue-in-cheek. The action moves quickly and I had to keep alert to keep up with the between-the-lines action of the two main characters. A good read."
2,The noise that won't stop!,"This Iomega HDD 250gb drive is a nice little drive that has both FireWire and USB connectors, and is sold at a good price. It works fine, and I'm sure these minimal design goals were chosen so as to look good in magazine checkbox chart reviews, and upon cursory examination of the box by shoppers in stores.But here's something the box and reviews don't say: This unit has NO POWER SWITCH but it does have a NOISY FAN. Take your choice: a constant whirring din, or physically pulling the plug when you don't want to use the drive and plugging it back in when you do want it.NO POWER SWITCH??!?!? What was Iomega THINKING?"
1,Not a good drive.,"We use this drive at work and i've just ordered it's replacement. The device constantly disapeers and you have to unplug the power and/or firewire cable to get windows to recognize it again (this has occurs on various computers). It is also loud. The fan has now cratered and it sounds horrible. I have fixed it several times by blowing it out and applying oil, but eventually it goes back to sounding horrible. The only thing good about this drive in my view is the backup software that comes with it. What I have done, and what I suggest, would be ordering an external enclosure and a regular internal drive to go in it. That way if the fan breaks or the HD goes back you only have to replace one item. It also comes out being quite a bit cheaper."
3,Functional but LOUD,"Good: Easy setup, fast, sturdyBad: Power switch is non-functional (must disconnect drive from PC before the power switch will work); no idle power-downUgly: Incredibly loud fanThis device is by far the noisiest thing in my office. I had intended to use it to store my large mp3 collection which means that it needs to run continuously. It is so noisy that it is not suitable for this purpose. I kept it anyway but will use it only as a backup device.If backups are your intended use, it's fine. If it needs to run all the time, look elsewhere. By the way, I also own the 120 GB model. It is very quiet (except for the well-known ""cat meow"" sound it makes ocassionally) and has proven to be very reliable."
5,"Webster's Medical Speller, Second Edition","This is an inexpensive, must have, quick glance word/speller desk reference book for medical transcriptionists. Always a time saver!"
3,my husband's family got more fun out of it than i did!,"the format used of drills for pronunciation is boring and the subject matters of the exercises are not relevant to today's Morocco. Outdated language is used much to the hilarity of my husband's family who are educated Moroccans. Examples of sentences taught are "" I gave the rifles to the judge"" and ""she hit the dog"". It's useful for the basics and the grammer but the choice of vocabulary taught means that whilst I know how to construct a sentence, I don't have the vocab! It has inspired me to learn Moroccan and then write a book for English speakers."
2,"This is Essentially Useless, and There's Nothing Better","This ""course"" is simply a reprint of an old Georgetown book from the 60s. It is garbage. The text is not in Arabic script (which is ridiculous) and the ""exercises"" are useless, but the vocab could be a good start if some of the words were not outdated and the author had explained which were Moroccan, Standard Arabic, French, or Spanish. The recordings, although insightfully encoded into MP3 format, are of the worst quality. They are clearly copies from tapes from back in the 60s when this book was useful. It sounds like they were recorded in a bathroom by someone who had smoked three packs of Winstons a day for 25 years. It was a decent language book for its time, but this is 2005. LET'S GET SOME NEW BOOKS GEORGETOWN!!! If that institution is such a bastion of Arabic studies in America, then I challenge it to get off its ass and put something out there (besides al-Kitab). This stuff is IMPORTANT these days. We Arabic students NEED it."
4,Prayer,"Good book about how to pray and how prayer has to do with the entire man. Prayer takes in man in his whole being, mind, soul and body.The entire man must pray. The whole man, life, heart and mind are in it."
4,The Good Neighbor,The book arrived within the specified time frame and was in the condition described on Amazon. I will use this bookseller again.
5,Sandy's Book Is Great Help with E-Mail,I can only take one little challenge at a time. So far Sandy Berger's book has helped me with e-mail and finding and organizing things. Those two chapters are my favorite chapters. The reward for working hard to understand attachments with Sandy's help is being able to receive pictures of all four grandkids that are scattered around the country. This book opened that door for me. I look forward to tackling other chapters and learning other skills.
4,Flashdance? or Flashbeagle? :),"Hee Hee. I'm definitely going to get this one. The Flashbeagle one is hilarious! I still have the beta version that I recorded off of tv when I was a kid. I love the scene where he dances at a disco, it is very funny. Doesn't have much of a plot but the 80's music and all in all good fun time that snoopy has...Well it makes it worth it. Enjoy :)"
3,Worth seeing for Flashbeagle,"The first special on this VHS, HE'S YOUR DOG, basically, in a word, sucks. The plot revolves around Snoopy needing to go to obedience school due to his bratty behavior. The story and dialogue are poorly written, and the animation is poor. Snoopy is such an unsympathetic character that the viewer doesn't care what hapens to him. The only redeeming things about this are some of the backgraound art and Vince Guaraldi's great soundtrack.On the other hand FLASHBEAGLE is overall great, probably one of the 10 best specials of all time. This is like a Peanuts homage to musicals. At times the ""dancing"" looks stiff and awkward; however, this is probably the best animation you can expect when dealing with characters whose limbs are like macaroni. A lot of the songs are quite catchy, like the ""Flashbeagle"" theme song, ""Listen to Lucy"", and ""Pigpen Hoedown""."
5,Almost makes you want to love humankind again.,"I dare anyone to read this book and not be changed.No one has Hilton's power of drawing a reader into the mind and heart of an ordinary bloke. I don't know how he does it; why do I care so much about his characters? He knows how to help the reader to sincerely CARE ABOUT a character, and therefore even his fellow man.The twist and twist of the plot and timeline can be challenging at times, but well worth the effort.And I thought the book was absolutely great BEFORE I read the last page!(BTW, don't confuse this great book with the mediocre chickflick movie of the same name, and I don't recommend watching the movie first, as it might spoil some of the suspense.)"
4,Love the movie,"Random Harvest is one of my favorite movies. I just bought this Kindle edition. I started to read ""look inside"" and liked the first paragraph. If the rest of the book is like the first paragraph, I'm going to love the book. I always wondered what the title meant, and the quote at the beginning answered my question. I will write a review when I am done reading. Gave it 4 stars since I haven't actually read it yet.What I wonder is why different Kindle editions of the same book are different prices. I had a change to buy a different edition of this book for $1.99 on sale and regular price is $9.99, but this edition is $2.99I also agree that I like this story better than ""Good-bye Mr. Chips"", Greer Garson starred in both movies.ttyl"
3,An expected ending,In saw the movie version many years ago as a child and had no memory of the story so I think I went into this book with no expectations. I thought that the flashback portions of the story were intriguing and well written. The present day portions of the book lacked the same details and the wife's behavior and character was not fully explored and explained nor their relationship. The ending was expected and fell a bit flat. It was theoretically the drama moment but he let It fall short.
4,Good to the last sentence,Loved the book. It was captivating to the last sentence. The geography and time frame interesting but I do not know from where the title came.
1,lost,I ordered this book for my nexus 7 but never received it. I could not find a way to contact and advise about my problem. Sounded like it could be a good book.
2,jeharsh thinks,"L found ths novel stodgy and not at all jnteresting to read. It did not work for this 82 year old despite the prominence of the author,"
4,Random Harvest,Excellent book well writen and holds interest all the way through. Both the historical and business aspects of this book appel to me - I have read it before but thoroghly enjoyed reaing it again.
3,Random Harvest,"Overall, i enjoyed the storyline of the book. There were parts that developed a minor character more than that character needed to be developed. Also, I would suggest that there be better spellcheck. I found more misspelled words that I should have expected."
3,Random Harvest,"The copy I received was overpriced for it's condition. The binding corners were damaged, pages were badly faded, it had a name written inside the cover and a penciled in price of $2. I would not order from this used book seller again."
3,Lost two years of love.,"Like so much 19th/20th century British Lit, I found it dry, long-winded, and soap opera paced. After 2/3's I'm asking When am I going to meet this chick he flipped over? On the plus side, the amnesia plot (lost two years of love) is fairly spellbinding."
3,A Novel: Random Harvest,The quality of the book is very good and the print was easy to read. I enjoyed it very much.
2,couldn't get into this book and I'm not the only one,This was selected for our book club and I was excited to start based on the description. After purchasing and starting that same night I expected the story line to pull me in and it didn't. I wasn't able to connect with the characters and in the end I got about 25% through and haven't tried reading again. I asked the book club their thoughts and all said the same thing. One was in the 3rd section and still wasn't connected with the book or characters. In the end we selected another book for the club meeting. I think I will try this book again we I have more time but right now I was disappointed that it didn't hold my attention.
3,reader,"Long story,good ending, the story dragged a bit, not one that was easy to keep reading. Never seemed to keep my interest, for long."
3,lesser work by mostly forgotten author,"Plot is an interesting vehicle for a work that asks us to think about what is important in life. The writing is dated, with conventions that may seem mawkish to a contemporary reader. Nonetheless it has probably held up better than anything on the current bestseller lists will. I thought it worth reading."
3,Fairly good read,I found parts of the book interesting and intriguing. Other parts I felt a little lost in time. Not a bad book but not a page turner for me.
3,imperfect but functional,"delivered a day late from Vanns. base has a shattered corner which has been glued of fixed.good thing its oriented in the back side. im not sure if its the dealer or the factory who glued or fixed it. box has no signs of it being dropped, styrofoam in the package has no breaks or tears. i figured its more of an inconvenience to ship it back especially its only $50. product-wise Sanus quality is great, other than the broken corner, its quite impressive. assembly time is 15 mins."
3,Average,"The mixing on this CD is good and brings out good contrasting of instruments as well as vocals but the actual song arrangements seem average. Nothing stands out. This CD seems good for background music in a restaurant or maybe if you have a large music collection this would serve as something like a filler of available space if you use some type of multi disk CD player or music server as the music here is not on the terrible side. However, this CD does not excite my senses at all. This of course is all my personal opinion based on my taste. You my love it."
3,A psychological interest,"It is interesting to me as a fan of the Beatles how so damn much evidence can pile up pointing to the idea that Paul was killed and replaced by a look alike yet is denied with such force. In those days Rock stars fell like flies but few had as many fortunes riding on them, he would have been replaced. In other words I think the ""Paul is Dead"" story is as likely to have happened as not. What is of greater interest is how far Beatles fans will go to disprove it. The very idea of the PID thingy seems to rock them to the foundation of their soul. To me -- that psychological phenomenon, swearing it a ""hoax"" and the like is more interesting. Who really cares if it is true Paul died and was replaced? We still got good music! I would recommend reading ""Carry That Weight: The Story of the Beatles"" for an even more interesting account of the whole thing."
1,"Amatuerish Writing, Boring Subject","What a yawn! Mr. Reeve treats his subject - an easily disproved rumour which circulated for about 6 weeks almost 30 years ago - as if it were the Kennedy assasination. The text reads like a bad episode of Dragnet. Repitition is the name of the game. Perhaps the best moment in this endless saga is Mr. Reeve's opening 'acknowledgements' page, wherein he thanks, among others, The Library Of Congress for helping him with all his 'years' of research (?!?) and - of course - ""The Fab Four"". What a pompous piece of worthless crap"
1,Plastic and Hot Coals . . . not a good combination,"Spend a buck or two extra. Get a wood handled grill brush. I've gone the cheap way myself in the past and purchased these useless plastic handled grill brushes.First off, you can't put any reasonable amount of preasure on them to do any real grill cleaning... the handle will flex too much.Then, if you have to clean the grill, while it's HOT (like for something else after the first course)... your bristles are going to get all messed up. The bristles will sink into the slowly melting handle.Unless the manufacture is using a high grade heat resistant plastic.It's 3 and some change folks ... I doubt they did.Yes... evetually a wood handle would surely burn. It's never happened with any of mine.And if your really keeping a wood brush that long cleaning it, then ""dude""... clean your grill more often."
5,Finally!!,"Finally a book that covers all of the victims! It made me cry and really feel for these people. The children's stories really affected me, I hadno idea things could get that bad for the children. I also had my eyes opened to the fact that men are abused quite ofetn. Keep writing M. Webb! You are doing a wonderful thing for many people. Can't wait for the next book.I also read Domestic Abuse Our Stories...just as good!"
4,The Best Of Robert Heinlein,"This is a collection of 8 stort stories written by Heinlein between 1939 and 1959. The stories are: Lifeline, The Roads Must Roll, And He Built a Crooked House, The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag, The Green Hills of Earth, The long Watch, The Man Who Sold the Moon, and All You Zombies. Good stuff! But calling it the ""best"" might be a streach. Doesn't have as much of the humour as some of his later works, like Friday and The Cat who Walks Through Walls. It is interesting to see how he imagined future events, some which have now transpired. A fun read."
4,The Irish Pixies,"The Frames today really don't sound like their debut. This album was produced by Gil Norton, who produced the Pixies, and there are some definite Pixie similarities here. Was Gil trying to make an Irish Pixies? Maybe. For me, it works. I like this album a lot. Glen Hansard is already an extremely emotive and charismatic vocalist, even if he does spend 60% of the album screaming (it is quite good screaming, I might add).There are a couple of quieter songs... ""Downhill from Here"" is quite beautiful, and ""The Waltz"" is, in fact, a waltz, even if there is some screaming and some tricky vocal time signatures in it. ""Telegraph Poles"" has a cool bass groove easing it along its mellow way.But mostly, you're going to be banging your head with this one."
5,Great for Neophyte and Web-Wizard Wannabe Alike,"I have been muddling my way through writing in HTML for a couple of years now and have figured out some of the quirks and wiggles on my own. I sure wish I would have owned this book from the get-go. Now that I do have it, I am able to better design my HTML tasks. The samples and examples are very crisp and clear, presented in color and are perfect for the visual learner. I use FrontPage 2000 to design my four web sites, probably not the first choice for those Super-Duper Web designers who wanna make a zillion bucks (ya, right...wake up in the New Millennium!!), but FrontPage 2000 has done all right by me. ""Teach Yourself Visually HTML"" is just the ticket to enhance and simplify my Web Designing adventure and seems perfect for the homebody web page designer in all of us."
5,Fine job by IDG - Highly Recommend.,"I jumped to this book after finding HTML 4 FOR DUMMIES didn't cut it. This book, by the same publisher, does what DUMMIES should, include excellent examples within the text instead of an associated CD. This book does the job, especially the clear detail in Chapter 10 entitled CREATE FORMS. The whole package is put together in a readable and VERY USABLE guide. I highly recommend it to others entering the world of HTML"
2,Not really worth buying,Just echoing Dale's review.Very brief descriptions on refining products and processes and then a whole bunch of not really useful Excel-from-the-ninties looking like tables and the graphs developed from these tables. Missing the essentials on Process Basics and Maths on both Process Engineering and Economics. Would try to find another book for the subject instead.
1,horrible,Everything broke first twist of the wrist. Very cheaply made. Couldn't be any more unsatisfied. Spend little gets you little quality I guess
2,"decent sockets, worthless ratchet","Pretty straightforward. The sockets are good, at least for the light work I do. The ratchet is flimsy and worthless."
3,simple occasional projects,"this is for not daily use.it's cheap but price is also cheapi use it for very minor chores around the house and use it about 5,6 times a year. I have a feeling this thing will not last long but i cannot complain with the price."
1,TERRIBLE!,Well our friends in CHINA have turned out another CHEAP CHEAP product! Sockets fall off the ratchet and extension with the slighest movement. Socket walls are so thin I am sure they would split with the lighest load! Bought this to carry around in the trunk of my car...I should have known better! Avoid this one! Amazon refunded my money right away and did not want the set returned.
1,Please DON'T BUY,"Please don't buy this set. I would give it no stars if I could.I was suckered into buying with some of the better reviews.Crudely made.The set came in a jumble of loose sockets. The case is flimsy and the sockets don'tsnap securely into the case or the wrench. Better socket sets lock the sockets intothe wrench.The chrome plating wasn't even completely on some sockets.Sure it's a low price, but it's not even worth this. I've gotten better tools in a99 cent store.Tools should be sturdy and safe. This socket set could hurt you if usingforce. I was only intending to use it occasionally, but I returned it. Ibought a better set and I'm much happier. For a few dollars more, geta better set.Great Neck PSO40 40 Piece 1/4-Inch and 3/8-Inch Drive Socket Set"
3,ok for occasional use,"Sockets are ok quality( at best), Ratchet and nut driver could be better. Received good customer service on replacement ratchet; the company sent me a replacement ratchet within a week's time.I would say this is a good starter set for very small projects but the sockets and the ratchet certainly wont hold up to any heavy use( even occasional on automobiles); IMO and experience.Recommendation;1.Pay a little extra and settle for better quality tools.2.Customer service from the company was good.12/6 update - Used the 10mm on the auto yesterday and the socket stripped.Thanks."
3,40 Piece Socket Set,"Bought this set to get my by till I could afford a more expensive set but was pretty disappointed. The 1/4"" to 3/8"" adapter broke when trying to loosen some rusty bolts. The wrench itself broke trying to put in some bolts. And the yellow handled screw driver like wrench, handle broke working on simple little bolts. Everything that could break,did. The sockets are fine though. Only buy for small projects, not working on an engine or any bolt torqued more than like 20ft/lbs."
3,"Good for price, ratchet is flimsy","I got this because hubby needed some metric sockets and this had them. Ratchet is flimsy but usable. Sockets are good quality. Case is fine. Would recommend for general use,especially for the price."
3,Better than nothing.,"This socket set is good in a pinch if you haven't got anything else. I bought it because it was so cheap and at the time, I didn't have a socket set. It kicked around in my car for a while until the day came I had to use it. It got the job done. That's all you can ask for, I guess. But as soon as I got home I ordered a proper socket set. Its worth the price if you have nothing else. If you think that you may use a socket set more than once or twice, obviously you'll want something a lot more serious than this."
4,Great Product Worth buying,I purchased this product because i do alot of work on my car and i must say it really came in handy the tools are of sturdy construction and they contain everything that you would need for day to day work around the house or on your car. the socket wrench is very well made and can take alot of pressure without snapping. i would recommend this product to anyone.
3,Invest in better quality,"This is a poorly made product. The ratchet handle is uncomfortable to hold due to the rough surface and sharp bottom edge. For the price, it's a good set if you only need to use it a few times a year. However, for the price, you get what you pay for...cheap."
1,Socket Set Made For Hobbits,This socket set is made for hobbits. It's miniature in size and has absolutely no functionality except to fix a kid's toy. My recommendation is don't buy this because it's not worth it and the product looks like it's going to break. I wish I got my money back.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Looked good out of the box. However, upon first use, the yellow handled driver broke. The plastic handle cracked while trying to loosen a nut. Then, the 1/4 inch adapter broke while using the ratchet inside the 13mm socket.Not a durable set of hardware to say the least."
2,You get what you pay for,"For the money, this is not a bad deal. Yet I found it to be of inferior quality. The ratchet looks like die cast metal even though it is ""triple chrome plated."" It is rough around the edges and is not like an evenly polished higher quality tool set you see at other stores. The driver handle is cheap plastic that reminds me of a similar one I had that split and broke from the shaft. For a flea market type set that does the job, I guess this is what you would be looking for."
3,it it ok,"i bought it because it was cheap...... that being said i knew that somthen woild be wrong and of course there was..... the cresent wrench was brocken in peaces, i was able to put it back together only because iv done it before. But other than that i was peased with it, although i went out and bought a craftsman cresent wrench to replace it anywho"
3,It is not in very good quality but good price,"I bought it only because it is so cheap, but the quality is not great. I would recommand it if you are looking for a very cheap product."
3,Good for the Money,"I purchased this so I could take apart a swing set as all of my other tools were lost in a flood. I wouldn't say this set would be good for a builder who would need to use them everyday, but for occasional use only."
2,socket set,this was not my best buy from amazon... i got what i paid for... maybe... the ratchet never worked ... you would be better off spending a few more dollars and get a real set... of course i did not buy this for everyday use more of a backup at work ...
2,Not a good value,First socket out of the set busted after one use. Manual torque. Not a solid product at all. I would recommend spending a few extra $$ and getting a better set.
3,Decent price,"flimsy ratchet, but the sockets make this low-priced set worth it. a good return for low cost."
3,Cheaper than I had expected,"The sockets appear to be the same quality of my old ""cheap"" set, however the socket wrench and hand wrench are made incredibly cheaply...worse than I had ever seen before...but for the price, I can overlook the quality of the socket wrench."
1,Not worth it,"Socket sizes not correct causing stripped bolts. Wrench unable to handle basic torque with out bending/flexing. Even for a cheap set, quality is horrible. I didn't expect it to last long, but I was not even able to complete the 1 small project I needed this product for. Spend a little extra for a better quality set, you will be glad you do. We are in the process of returning this item 2 days after receiving it. Product should not even be sold on Amazon."
1,cheap and flimsy,I know you get what you pay for. But why even include the rachet. The very first time I tried to use it on a simple tool it broke. I'm thinking the sockets won't hold up under pressure either. Don't buy it. Spend the extra amount to get a decent set.
1,Worth $7 and thats it,Took rachet out..fitted on bolt..turned to unloosin..and it fell completly apart..the sockets are ok..You get what you pay for..word of advice..buy a better rachet
2,worth it for the price,the ratchet is too weak. not even able take off one nut before it broke. need to shop for another one now.
4,Great Buy,"This product is so great, so with the price, its a great bargain and so usefull around the house and in my cars."
2,:( REGULAR PRODUCT,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY BUT THE PRICE IS RIGHT FOR YOU HAVE .. IT IS VERY USEFUL FOR THE HOME BUT NOT FOR AUTOMOTIVE MECHANICS
3,"good price, handy set","I have much more expensive sockets and wrenches in my tool cabinet. However, this little set is what I grab when I have a quick job to do away from the rolling cabinet/tool chest. I replaced the 1/4 inch wrench with an 1/8 inch rachet (and appropriate adapter). Everything has worked fine for jobs around the house and boat. And if I loose a socket overboard it is not a big deal! I like the price and I think it is a nifty practical little set. Get one. They cost next to nothing. (BTW, my set is another brand name, but it looks (suspiciously) otherwise identical."
1,BAD IMAGE,"This image shows that the tools are big and could be put to use. The real tools are small, the largest could not even open the wheels of my bike. Beware, right now i don't know what to use it for"
4,Me gusta,herramientas escenciales y utilies para el auto me gustaron bastante y son especiales para salir a carretera y en un paquete compacto
1,For display only,"I decided to buy this because I needed to do an oil change on my car. After two minutes of using it the wrench it got stuck and never worked again. You can actually tell it is bad quality just by turning it by hand. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone (not even for a small job). The item is on its way back for a full refund thanks to Amazon great customer service. Lesson learned, whether you use them a lot or not, these tools need to be of good quality so spend the extra couple of dollars and save yourself the hassle."
3,its okay,its an ok buy... there is no major issue with it .. the only issue i had is that the socket sizes are a bit hard to read .. otherwise its ok.
1,Price higher than quality,I knew I was not getting a great set but the price was higher than the quality of the tools.
1,Not recommended,"This book has so many technical errors it is essentially useless for its intended purpose, as a study aid for the BSCN test. Not only are there many technical errors, but the authors basic sentence structure is sometimes incoherent. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I will be sending it back for a refund!"
1,Awful...,"Although I passed w/ an 839, this book is, in a word, awful. The errors are unbelievable, the flow is choppy, and the illustrations are difficult to follow - just look at page 469. Quality was definately sacrificed for speed. I can't believe a CCIE put his name on this book. I hope the money was worth the discredit...Although the book did cover everything on the exam, the mistakes lead to lots of re-reading and frustration."
1,Too Error-Prone to Use!,"I was excited to get this book, because it was the first (that I knew of) on the new BSCN exam. However, I very quickly found that its errors were too many and too egregious to be borne. It's as if the publisher never ran it past any editor at all. The book has some limited utility for a person who already knows the material pretty well, and can spot its awful flubs, but for someone learning from scratch - never! It is definitely not worth its steep price."
5,It Did The Trick For Me,"This book and the Boson practice tests were the only things I used to prepare for the BSCN test and I passed with an 850. I did see some things on the test that I dont remember seeing in this book but not enough to matter. If you are looking for a book that shows you the test before you take it, then this is not the book for you. This book makes you read and comprehend - sorry. There were some errors but I have seen errors in every tech book I've ever read - even Cisco Press books. Get this book along with some practice test and you will be OK. By the time the so-called better books are published, you will have your CCNP."
4,"Doesn't make you an expert, but more than enough to pass.","I only gave this book 4 stars because of the numerous typos. Bottom line is, it's an easy read--a much easier read than the Sybex book or the Cisco Press. If your goal is to pass the BSCN, and if you want a book that's straight forward, with the authors not trying to impress you with unnecessary technical mumbo jumbo, then this is your book. With this book, and the study questions from cheet-sheets.com, you're sure to pass. I passed with an 816 only reading this book once, reading two chapters a week. Just remember, you only need 690 to pass. Good luck."
3,Don't use this as the SOLE book you study from!,"I found the book extremely helpful in terms of clearly explaining the overview of the concepts to be studied. But it was lacking in down & dirty detail and as many people have pointed out was filled with typos and other errors. Using it together with the Cisco Press book really worked for me. If the typos are fixed, great, but I still wouldn't count on it as the only book to study from."
1,"Pretty small, tight and doesn't come down far enough to cover my ears",I selected this one over the others here because it wasn't labeled as small like some others. But it also is too small for an adult head. Wasted my money.
5,Staggering good...,"Not really a biography, tho it is very biographic. Not really a study of Feminism, tho most of the women were early pioneers. Not really a study of Lesbians, tho most of the women were, at least, bisexual. What this book does, and it does it extremely well, is illustrate how these women struggled to 'define' themselves, as artists, as authors, as sexual beings, as individuals at a time when women were generally perceived as little better then simple minded children factories. From Gertrude Stein to Djuna Barnes to Natalie Barney (Rene Vivian...'a life spent looking for death')such different people but sharing a common thread of struggle (and cost). I've read a lot about this period and these women, and no book has given me a better understanding of them and emotional empathy with them, then this book."
5,An Excellent Overview of Many Great Continental Philosophers,"As a student of Dr.Kearney, I can say with confidence that this work is a very excellent and informative survey of the world's modern western continental philosophers. For anyone interested in studying philosophy, this is an great place to find where your interests lie and where a possible concentration might possible develop. For those who seek specifics, this work is divided into a section of phenomenology and hermeneutics, then a section on critcal thinking and theory and finishes off with a study of structuralism. Definitely a worthwhile read for anyone interested in western philosophy."
5,One of the best of a great series,"As the proud owner of There Goes a Truck, Train, Airplane, Bulldozer, Dumptruck and Fire Truck, I can say that according to my son (24 months), this is one of the best. He asks for it about ten times a day, and watches it intently."
2,snooze,"This video is handicapped by the fact that there is little real-life fire truck action. Bulldozers and trains can be filmed while they are serving their true purpose, but here real firefighting is absent. Instead we are treated to practice fighting against a weak fire in a bland concrete structure (give us a destructive blaze, for crying out loud!), demonstrations of hoses, long lectures on equipment, serious-faced safety warnings, and various data, like how long the hoses are and how many gallons of water can be sprayed per minute. To spice it up, Dave treats us to high-tech video tricks like having the firemen go backward up the pole and slide, Wow!This production feels more like a 3rd grade field trip to the local station, captured on video by the student teacher. My kids found other things to do about halfway through."
3,A mild disappointment,"My son received There Goes a Bulldozer as a gift for his second birthday and we almost wore it out, so when I wanted a gift for him I chose this one as a follow-up. But where Bulldozer has a lot of slapstick humor to keep kids interested, this one is more straightforward. The firefighters use a lot of big words, and Firefighter Dave isn't on screen much. My son enjoys this one, but not as much as Bulldozer."
1,Old outdated don't waste your $$$,"I had High hopes for this video based on the reviews I read. 10 years ago it might have been an OK video but by today's standards it doesn't compete. The Video quality is bad and looks like it was shoot with home video camera, the material and the look is dated. This video should be called what fire trucks use to look like. Save your money till a newer one comes along."
5,excellent video for kids interested in (fire) trucks,"This is our first Dave Hood ""There Goes a .... "" video, but it won't be the last. The host, Firefighter Dave, does a fine job of holding kids' interest while making the information entertaining. In the course of this 35-minute video you'll be introduced to many firefighters in various situations, visit firefighter training facilities, and get tours of the firehouse and several types of trucks, including fireboats and airport firetrucks. There is nothing frightening or scary here, and the ""don't play with fire"" message is stated simply and clearly. We watch this video multiple times a day, and the adults in the house have not been driven insane. Our son has surprised us with the things he understands about fire engines, and we're looking forward to viewing others in the series. Actually, my _husband_ suggested we get more of the series -- especially the one about airplanes.Highly recommended for little (and big) firetruck enthusiasts."
3,Seemed a little over the head of a 3 year old,"My son just turned 3 and I got this for him based on the reviews. The video is well-made and informative, but it didn't hold my son's attention yet. There were too many close-ups of the firemen actually talking about how they loved their job etc. I've tried playing it a couple of times and it has not held his interest. I'm thinking he will be more interested in it in another year or so. I used to be on a hazardous material response team myself, so it was interesting to see the bomb squad suits etc, but a 3 year old doesn't even know the word bomb yet (thank goodness). The music/production reminded me of the short training videos we used to watch"
2,a dim bulb (most of the time),"These things could be a little brighter but for the $$, they are better than a dark path!"
3,"Runs all night, but cheap materials","I do like these solar markers. They run all night long and are very visable. So far none have been stolen yet. The only thing I have against them is the thin wall PVC pipe used and the plastic ground stake. The stake already has broken off on two of them. I purchased these from another vender for the same price but got two of them instead of one,...just google it."
3,Average Headphones,"The headphones look pretty neat and have a cool volume control, but they feel cheaply built, and the sound quality isn't that great. It's what you would expect for headphones around 20 bucks."
2,Don't waste your money,"These headphones are pretty bad. The sound quality is bad. I'm not real picky when it comes to sound quality and even I noticed how awful these were. Plus they have volume control on the cord, and my brother told me that it would eventually start to make static sounds, so I never used it hoping that it wouldn't get static-y but it did anyway and it didn't take long. If they were only $5 then i would say they were ok but for almost $20 no way. Try the wrap around your head Sony's they are great and not too expensive."
4,Under-rated,"I loved this movie and I feel its very under rated. Yes the story was a little on the weak side but there was some fantastic action, good comedy and a wonderful setting. Too bad it didn't do well in the box office because a follow up would have been awesome."
1,CLINT OH CLINT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?,"I cannot believe I have to give a movie that has the Man in itone star,but if you go to buy this BEWARE! This is snore-borestage 101. And I love Eastwood films,even those bad ones thatare going thru your mind right now. This however is his worstEVER! I mean while watching I defy you too not go a least onceZZZZZ""HUH"" WHAT,WHAT HAPPENED?Oh yeah thats right I have PinkCrapillac on,yeah thats right..ZZZZZZZ=ZZZZZZZZ=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"
3,"Not a laugh a minute, but ...","Not a big hit, not a laugh a minute but a terrific cast and the interplay between the characters played by Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds makes this a fun movie to watch."
3,Eastwood and Reynolds try Abbott and Costello.,"I must take exception to Mr. Maltins' review of this one. At no time during the viewing of this film (my copy at least) do the stars ""pour gasoline on a guy and set him on fire..."". There is a scene where a gangster becomes soaked with gasoline from a ruptured gas tank. There is a subsequent fire but I saw no one being burned. In another scene our heroes threaten to ignite the posterior of another guy after saturating it with alcohol but no ignation takes place. All in all a good time killer with some pretty good sight gags. The gun fight in the garage is close to being a classic. Give us a break Len, it's escapism and worth a look."
3,worth a try,"Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I thought this movie was decent. Not a real gripping story, I like putting this one on before taking a nap. The scenery and soundtrack are relaxing. If you are new to Clint Eastwood movies, I would go with pale rider or magnum force before buying this one."
2,"Minor, atypical Eastwood","A major dud at the box-office when released in 1989, ""Pink Cadillac"" was perhaps the first serious sign that Clint Eastwood's career was in need of a comeback (which came in the form of ""Unforgiven"" three years later). If his Oscar winning western is his best film, ""Pink Cadillac"" may very well be his worst. As both an action film and a comedy, it's pretty lame most of the time, but it remains a must-see for Eastwood fans in that he has never before (and only rarely since) been so extroverted on screen. He's quite funny throughout, and his performance compensates for a script that is as ridiculous as it is cliched. Though a minor credit in Eastwood's impressive filmography, ""Pink Cadillac"" is worth a look for his fans."
3,Good quality disk,"....but crappy movies. These three Clint Eastwood movies have got to be the CHEESIEST movies he's ever made! The only redeeming element of Pink Cadillac was Bernadette Peters! What a FOX! Honkytonk was just awful! Clint Eastwood CAN NOT SING! I felt nothing but embarrassment for him! These 3 movies were on the same level as ""Any which way but loose"" and ""Any which way you can"". Five of Clint Eastwood's worst self produced flix. Better left forgotten in lost memories."
4,City Heat.,"Not one of Clint's better films, but kind of fun taken for what it is. Rare to find as a DVD."
3,A Thin satire,"Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood play a PI (former cop) and police detective respectively seeking to bring down ""snotball"" bad guys in a 1930's genre gangster movie. While not normally a fan of satire, it has an entirely different flavor when actors are poking fun at themselves rather than someone else. It is fun to watch Reynolds and Eastwood play highly exaggerated stereotypes of their signature characters - a little like watching Jackie Chan outtakes.Unfortunately, the satire rapidly wears a little thin like the same joke being repeated over and over again for an hour and a half. The ending is especially lame; as if they just got tired of making the movie and slapped something together so they could all go home.Is it worth watching? Yes, if someone is in the right mood and doesn't expect too much."
3,Never Mess With A Man`s Automobile,Eastwood stars in the watchable comedy about a bounty hunter who is sent to bring in a woman who is on the run from her husband and his band of racists. This is a poor attempt at comedy for Eastwood. Watch for Jim Carrey in his second Eastwood film(the other being The Dead Pool) he plays the Vegas Comic.
1,Not a great one*,"Sorry, but it's not a good one... & I love most Clint movies... sorry to have to give this one a bad review.To sum up- alot of fighting- but boring!"
4,Great film,"I love movies set in this era. I love the clothes, the cars, the music; it was just a simpler time in America's history.Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood play off of each other so well and the one-liners are hilarious. Great plot, great comedy, and great fun.Reynolds when Eastwood walks unannounced into the office: ""I didn't hear you knock.""Eastwood: ""What a relief. I thought I was going deaf.""These two constantly banter like this throughout the whole fim and it's always funny.Give this fun flick a try."
4,For Eastwood Fans...,"As a Clint Eastwood fan, I could not pass on a Three Movie DVD at a one Movie price.I like these movies, I do.Some say that 'Pink Cadillac' is one of his poorest efforts, yet Bernadette Peters easilymakes up for that. So I really like that movie also.Overall, a good purchase."
4,"City Heat, enjoy a movie","A good test of a movie is if the critics liked it. If they pan it, it is generally a good show.City Heat does not take itself seriously. It was shot to be entertainment. There is no great social commentary. It was written to entertain and if you permit yourself to sit back and enjoy, it does just that. It is not the greatest film ever made by any of the principals, but it is a fun and enjoyable movie. Something that is needed by all from time to time.Quit trying to be a film critic, and enjoy the show."
3,Not the best Clint represntation,"Three Clint Eastwood ""comedies"". ""Honky Tonk Man"" is one of his best most underrated movies. As for the other two, ""City Heat"" is a broad and silly neo-noir that could have been really great if it had been taken seriously as it is it's only silly and never funny, but Clint and Burt are both great stars and good to see them together. As for ""Pink Cadillac"", the less said the better. Worth the purchase for ""Honky Tonk Man"" and ""City Heat"" if you've never seen it.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
4,"My daughter, 3 thinks Dave is funy and the equipment neat.","I must disagree with the previous reviewer. While, I don't find the video all that interesting it seems to appeal perfectly to the 3-6 year old set. It isn't an instructional video, it's a fun, silly video with a little slapstick and a lot more educational value than most."
3,its ok,"i saw this video once and the footage of bulldozers is cool but Construction Foreman Dave is kinda dumb. It gets really annoying when he says ""I Shouldn't Of Done That""! i would say it is a ok video."
5,a great video,"i have given this video to several of my friends kids (ages 2-5), and they love it. it's silly enough to be fun but also interesting and educational. i was amazed when we passed a construction site with the 4 year old in the car, and he started naming every machine on the site! this one and all the ""there goes a..."" videos are winners."
4,"2-Year-Old Son's Favorite ""There Goes A..."" Video","This was my son's first and favorite movie in the ""There Goes A..."" series. The video features many different construction sites and vehicles, and explains (on a rudimentary level) how buildings are constructed. The humor IS corny, but well-suited for the 2-year-old audience. (Example - My son always laughs when the port-a-potty that Dave is sitting in is lifted up by a crane). I do agree with the other reviewer's comment that some things may be a bit scary (like being run over by a roller), but I feel that the video portrays it in a spoof-like manner to avoid frightening young children."
2,To much face time with Dave,"My two year old son loves tractors and construction equipment. Unfortunately, the narrator's attempt of ""being funny"" becomes lengthy and irritating. There are some good equipment shots but Fred Levine's ""Road Construction Ahead"" and Sandbox Video's ""Big Construction Machines"" are superior, in my opinion, to this video. 'Too much time watching someone talk and act ""funny"" and not enough time spent on the equipment."
2,There Goes a Bulldozer.,"We have purchased many truck videos for our 2 year old. He has loved them all! Until we purchased ""There Goes a Bulldozer"", from Toys R Us. The camera was focused mostly on this Dave person and not on the construction equipment! We purchased ""There Goes a Dump Truck"" and were very happy with the Dave charecter (dirrerent actor)I would recommend purchasing the Dump Truck viedo, but don't waste your money on the Bulldozer."
2,A weak link in the series,"My son has most of the ""There Goes a..."" videos and loves them. This one, however, is a bit odd. First, there are too many repetitive shots of explosions. Perhaps these are ""cooler"" for slightly older kids (my son is now 23 months; he has been watching these videos since about 17 months)but young children much prefer moving vehicles; the explosions are too sudden and scary. Then, because so much of it is shot on-site at a construction site, there is a lot of background noise that Dave has to shout over. All in all, it is somewhat disconcerting and a little boring for my son. He prefers Truck, Firetruck and Airplane."
5,A must have,"I didn't know if my child would sit and watch this being he is a fan of animated shows. But he loves it. The first day he watch it three times in a row. He loves tractors and trucks so much I ordered three more shows of There Goes A...If you have a child who loves firetruck, tractors, airplanes, these videos are the kind of entertainment you should look into. Not only are the funny, in a silly way, they are educational. We hope to purchase more when the DVD come out."
4,Great for toddlers and pre-school,"As an adult viewer, I do find this video rather lacking -- BUT -- my three year old son loves this video -- and it is somewhat instructional as well. He is constantly pointing out and correctly identifying all sorts of construciton equipment -- and often corrects his parents -- ""That's not a bulldozer, that's a front-loader!"" With respect to the director's appearances in the video, it seems to add to my son's overall enjoyment of the video."
1,If violence is your thing,"I bought this video after reading the reviews and thought my son would love it. Instead, he wasn't interested and I eventually turned it off because I thought that the humor centered far too much around running people over with bull dozers and other voilent acts I rather he didn't see or think were funny."
5,great,"Ok, ok. I know you're not ""supposed"" to put your child in front of the TV while you try to get something done. But here in the real world we have to do just that every once in a while. At least if I put on a video I know there won't be any surprises that I don't want my 2-1/2 year old seeing. This video is great for just that purpose. It runs a little over 1/2 an hour so it's not too long that I can take advantage of the ""free time."" It's just long enough to get dinner started and sometimes on the table. My son has loved it from the moment we first popped it into the VCR. I have also learned a lot about big machinery from it and have taken our education into the real world. He can now sit in the car as we run our errands and point out steam rollers, excavators, bulldozers, etc... which makes car time a lot less tedious. Highly recommended."
2,It's not about bulldozers....,"The video starts out showing various structures being demolished with explosives. Next we move to construction sites and watch various pieces of machinery (not bulldozers) from a long distance. Eventually we see excavators and tower cranes. Along the way, we see one or two bulldozers.The last 15 minutes of the video is definitely the best. We finally see earth moving equipment close up. But, again, we don't see a lot of bulldozers.The title is definitely a misnomer. This video isn't that bad, but it's definitely NOT about bulldozers.Our two year old seemed to enjoy it. However, unlike other ""There goes a..."" videos, he didn't ask to see it again when it was over."
1,Avoid. Narrator D.H. steals the spotlight,"The video camera spends far too much time pointed at narrator Dave Hood and far too little pointed at the bulldozers and other heavy equipment that are supposed to be the center of attention. The equipment scenes last only a few seconds before we are whisked off to something else, each scene change affording Mr. Hood an opportunity to prance about in front of the camera. He should have stayed behind it."
4,Not many Bulldozers in this video,"The title is misleading, but for kids looking for big machine action it works. There Goes a Dump Truck is another excellent video for kids that love heavy equipment."
1,Did Not Work,"This did not work for me. You could not see it from the outside, but my windshield was streaked along the path of the wiper blades to the extent that it always looked dirty from the inside. I used a 600 rpm cordless drill with a fully charged battery. I tried the first pad over much of the window for about 15 minutes. Rinsed and dried the windshield. No improvement noticed. I then used a second pad on a one foot area for 8-9 minutes. By now the battery was running down. I rinsed and dried the windshield. I could see no improvement anywhere. I quit trying."
4,"He, She, It","I bought this book because I haven't played soccer since I was a kid so I had some catching up to do. The book is very easy to follow and understand though the writer was constantly referring to the reader as ""she"" which I found to be both annoying and distracting."
2,NOT the BEST from the BEST,"The waffle maker and sandwich maker USED TO work great. (I never had the opportunity to use the pizzelle part.) Everyone in the family, including the kids, hated the BAM! written all over their food but the food came out great. It worked fine for three or four months but then the non-stick coating started to bubble and peel off. And it is supposed to be high-end ALL-CLAD? It ended up being returned with no questions asked...makes me wonder how many others were returned. Hmmm..."
4,First impression is pretty good,"I just got my Emerilware yesterday and have already used it to make pocket sandwiches and waffles. My nine year old daughter loves the BAM written across her waffles. The waffles turned out perfectly - no sticking at all and nice, easy clean up. I had problems with the sandwiches, though. I must have overstuffed them because the cheese overflowed all over and make a real mess. The top does not separate from the bottom so it was very difficult to clean the melted cheese from between the two plates. I figure it's going to take me a few more messy sandwiches before I learn how to stuff them properly. I haven't had a chance to make pizzelles yet, but I'm looking forward to it. [...]"
2,If only Emeril made better quality stuff,"I've had this for awhile now and it worked great a first. I've never used the Pizzelle plates, and only occasionally use the sandwich plates. However, I have started using the waffle plates frequently because my 2 year old is addicted to waffles now, and the non-stick coating is no longer working. Doesn't seem to be coming off, like I read in another review. It just doesn't work. I have to spray the plates with cooking spray before each new waffle and it still requires finesse to get the waffle off in one piece. I must say, I've never been an Emeril fan and this just makes me like him even less."
2,BAM! Right back in the mail...,"My wife wanted a pizzelle maker for Christmas and the combination pizzelle/sandwich/waffle maker led me to this device. I should have read the previous review more closely. The pizzelles and waffles will have that ridiculous catchphrase ""Bam!"" printed on them. For that reason alone we are sending it back. Bam! could have been printed all over the machine, is it really necessary to have it printed on the cooked food? I suppose I can't comment on how well the machine works as we did not use it. --- BAM! Right back to Amazon it goes."
5,Exactly what it says it is,"I have never owned/bought a fabric poster before, but these are pretty neat. My boyfriend is obsessed with Opeth so I bought this as a gift for him. It looks good on his bedroom wall. I know it says how big it is but I didn't picture it being so large. Definitely recommend if this is one of your favorite bands and you have the wall space."
3,BATMAN RETURNS ONLY THE SAME PLOT,"A SEQUEL MORE COOL THAN THE ORIGINAL, THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE COOL, THE COSTUMES ARE COOL, AND THE BATMOBILE IS SO SLEEK, I RATHER DRIVE ALL THREE OF THEM"
3,Sequel that's better than Original,"Good sequel to the dark original has more color with both heros and villians. The story is developed better, and Catwoman was surprisingly developed. Could use improvements, but so do all the Batman films."
3,BATMAN RETURNS IS THE LAST DECENT MOVIE IN THE BATMAN SERIES,"""Batman Returns"" is a very dark and stylized sequel, Tim Burton once again managed to reflect the true essence of Gotham City's dark knight. This time around, our superhero must battle against a classic nemesis: ""The Penguin"" (magnificently portrayed by an inspired Danny DeVito), but the bird man is not alone; along with the penguin, there is an evil (and sexy) villain: Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), and also there is a third villain, the evil businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).The plot sometimes is a little silly, but the special effects, the sets, the fight sequences, the costumes, the gadgets and the penguins army make ""Batman Returns"" a very entertaining film that looks great. Also, it's the last entry in the Batman series which featured Tim Burton and Michael Keaton. Of course, the next two sequels are pretty poor films without them."
1,"Huge audio glitch, cut version and missing commentary (R2)","The transfer is beautiful, with much more accurate colour tones and very little artefacts remaining, and the special features were absorbing and informative, but there's a huge audio glitch! The audio of the message on Selina's answer machine is completely missing!!!! When Selina replies and moans about it under your breath, you'll think 'what is she talking about?' I'm very annoyed with this extremely obvious glitch! I'm surprised no-one has mentioned it.Also, this is the cut version!!! The scene in which Catwoman places an aersol can in the microwave is missing! Fortunately, the nuncahkus cut from the previous DVD has been restored, though. Still, the BBFC should have passed the microwave cut. It's uncut in the US!And finally, the commentary is missing, despite what it says on the back of the DVD case, but the Region 1 DVD has it!!!Otherwise, it's a great DVD for a great film. I was reviewing Region 2 version by the way."
1,Don't buy this dvd,"Don't buy this dvd cause Warner may release this title in a near future again with special features,trailers,notes and etc.Just like they did with Twister,Interwiew with the Vampire...and more to come...."
5,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid.,This movie is Awesome! I love it so much it is very dark and action packed! It has a very great story and an excellent ending! The third best batman movie and one of the best superhero movies ever. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton and he this is one of his greatest films! The actors were great escpecially Danny Devito he was Perfect it was like he knew everything about the penguin! Michelle Pfeifer was great also she was everything a catwoman should have.
2,Dramtic danny DeVitos best,It wasn't great but deVito's performance as the villianous penguin is outstanding.
2,Nostalgia crushed,"I had good memories seeing the Batman movies as a kid, when rewatching them (such as Batman Returns), those memories were immediately shot. The plot lines are somewhat bizarre and the character development leaves something to be desired. Its one of those movies you watch once, and then don't ruin it by watching it again. Proceed directly to the Dark Knight series."
5,"Batman Returns, Blu-ray",This was a gift for my son-in-law. I assume that he was pleased with it since he requested it. I was pleased with the fast shipping.
2,Not good as the rest...,"The original batman with the Joker as the villian, staring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, was a great movie. It was a shock to me, who had only seen the later sequels and Batman Begins. I enjoyed Forever a lot more than most people. Val Kilmer was great, and so was Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey. Truthfully, I loved Batman and Robin. Arnold and Uma played the best Batman villians to date, and George Clooney was a good Batman.Batman Returns is actually the last one I watched, and I have to say it isn't that good. Danny Devito as the Penquin is good, but Michelle Phiefer sucked (Halle Berry was better) as Catwoman. On top of that, the plot of this movie (Of Penquin becoming major) is unrealistic, silly, and would never happen with excessive force. Also, Batman doesn't have many lines. All he seems to be a brick and stop the enemies; that's it.This the weakest Batman Movie. Why anybody thinks this is better than the next two is beyond me."
2,Devito sinks this movie something fierce,Look the first Burton-directed Batman film with Jack Nicholson as the Joker scored well enough but this movie with Devito sucking bigtime as the Penguin is just putrid. Outside of his Taxi series DeVito really bites. On other matters while I like comely Michelle Pfeifer a lot in this movie I don't understand how her character of Salina becomes crazy. The fall hit her head?
2,Batman Returns For What?,I waited for this much anticipated sequel only to be disappointed. Michael Keaton did not seem to carry the movie as he did with the first one. The focus of the movie seem to be on the Penguin and Catwoman characters. The story of the Penguin is a sad one but I do not need to hear about it for the entire story. Catwoman as a love interest for Batman was overrated and the final scene where Batman reveals to Catwoman who he is was weak. Still a good movie no less.
1,WOW! Can a movie actually be THIS bad!,"Michael Keaton amazing performace,Catwoman and the visual effects are the only things that saves this monvie from being the WORST movie ever made!Danny Devito(boy he should had got that Razzie)and Christopher Walken are horrible!The story is so awful that a 5 year old could do a better job.This movie sucks compared to the other three(Batman and Robin is SO much better)and is so overrated.Avoid at all costs!"
1,One of the WORST movies EVER Made,"Michael Keaton's amazing performance,Catwoman,and the visual effects are the only thing saving this movie from being the worst film ever made.Danny Devito(boy he should have won that Razzie,and Christopher Walken,are horrible in this movie and the script is SO awful that a five year old could do better.I am so glad that Batmn Forever saved the series and Batman and Robin is 1000x better than this!Avoid this movie at ALL costs!!!!"
3,"Decent sequel,but could have been better","Batman Returns(which was Burton's and Keaton's second Batman film),was alright,but I thought the story was kind of thin,and The Penguin was just a mess.I would have liked to see more of a ""tuxedo-wearing,human looking,overweight corrupt guy"" kind of Penguin,like how he is in the comics,and not some type of mutant looking creature,like he is in this film.But other than that.Catwoman was really good,and so were the other characters.But this was NOWHERE NEAR as good as the original movie was,in my opinion."
4,Gotham is darker than before.,"On seeing the second installment in the Batman trilogy, I immediately though it wasn't going to be that good. I think it is one of the best film sequels of all time. The main character didn't change, the characters were richer and more evil, and the acting got even better. Tim Burton really hyped up the gothic in this film. This film was more serious and hair raising. It lacked the exitement the first had, but it is still better than the third and fourth installments. I applaud Michelle P. for her portrayal of Selina Kyle (AKA Catwoman.) she couldn't have been better. Two thumbs up. See this film."
4,Best Batman Movie!,"Like the majority of reviewers, I absolutely think Batman Returns is the best of the lot - it's peppered with the greatest lines (after exchanging those wonderful dialogue about deadly mistletoe and a even deadlier kiss, Catwoman whispered in Batman's ears, ""Does it mean we have to start fighting again?""); best on-screen (and apparently off-screen) chemistry between Batman and the leading lady; the darkest but most delectably poignant ending for the star-crossed lovers. This is the one film you can watch over and over again and still be swept away by Tim Burton's flair in directing dark, dreamlike sequences; world-class acting skills; and a highly intelligent script."
4,Very entertaining but not for the kids,"This time the Caped Crusader battles the schizo Catwoman, the Penguin and the millionaire Max Schreck (pun) who wants the Penguin elected as mayor. Having been consigned at birth to the sewers (where he grew up) due to his deformity, the Penguin is hell-bent against society.A fun, stylish, but dark and mean spirited movie that is very entertaining if you don't consider a few holes in the script. Visually compelling as expected from virtuoso Burton but definitely too grisly for the kids."
1,This movie sucks,"I dont know how people can watch this movie and call it a good sequel. The movie is dreadful, and the Penguin is the worst villian in the Batman series. Burgess Meredith played Penguin in the orignal series, and is the only man who can play Penguin. This movie is too long, and its basically 2 hours of talking and about 20 minutes of action that is thrown in here and there. Save your money and buy the regular dvd with no speical features, this movie is not worth rebuying for speical features."
5,batman kicks ass,this is one of the cooler movies out there.the only thing that was kind of disappointing was that it didnt show batman alot till the end.it could have at least showed bruce wayne alot more like they did in the original.but its not just this movie its all super heroe movies.it barely shows the heroe when the movie is about that heroe.but its fine.i cant wait to see batman begins i hope it doesnt have to be so old fashioned like i see in the pictures.i think that micheal keaton should have played the rest of the batmans but i like val and george.i think that batman forever and batman and robin should have got 4 stars like the 1st two when the first two were kind of boring.oh well.this movie still kicks ass.go batman for dc go spider-man for marvel comics
3,"NOT AS ENTERTAINING AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT, IT'S STILL GOOD","THIS TIME, BATMAN [MICHAEL KEATON] RETURNS TO BATTLE THE PENGUIN [DANNY DEVITO] AND THE CATWOMAN [MICHELLE PFEIFER]. NOT AS ENTERTAINING AS THE FIRST, BUT, IT'S STILL A GOOD MOVIE. IT'S A GOOD THING THAT MICHAEL KEATON RETURNED AS BATMAN FOR THIS ONE. CAUSE IF HE DIDN'T, THIS ONE MIGHT NOT HAVE TURNED OUT SO GOOD. IT HAS ENOUGH ACTION AND ENOUGH GOOD SCENES TO MAKE IT WATCHABLE. THIS WAS THE SECOND AND LAST BATMAN MOVIE THAT WOULD EVER FEATURE MICHAEL KEATON AS BATMAN."
3,"It's alright, but its too dark and gorey.","The Penguin wants to make the world into one big winter wonderland. He also wants to know who his parents are and his true identity. Pretty good story, but this movie is highly slow-paced and tends to drag. At the same time, a Gotham City secretary gets pushed out of a window and becomes Catwoman."
2,.,"Tim Burton's worst movie, hands down. It's visually interesting, but that's about all. Batman himself seems like a secondary character in this sequel, and unfortunately I couldn't get into Danny Devito very much. He plays the role well, I suppose, but the story is awfully flimsy and there just isn't much to latch onto here. I will say that Michelle Pfiefer ... oh my ... I had a crush on her for months after seeing this for the first time. And it isn't just the skin-tight leather outfit (although it sure helped.) My. But in any case, watching her was the only redeemable distraction I could find in this disappointingly poor movie."
4,Very good gothic movie...,"I watched this movie a long time ago and enjoyed it enormously.All the characters make the movie entertaining to say the least. There's the vicious Penguin, the threatening Red Triangle circus gang, the elusive Batman, the mysterious Alfred and the half-insane Catwoman.The most interesting character for me was Selina Kyle (Catwoman). She was a mass of contradictions.Seeing her fight between her own insanity and humanity was quite fascinating. The scenes where she and Batman are together are electric in the sense that both of them have deep psychological issues.Selina also uttered a quote that seems to relate to everyday life for most people. ""I would love to go home with you and live with you in your castle. But that's not how life is.""Straight up the movie was good and the settings were eerily beautiful and ghoulish."
3,Fun but overdone,"Batman takes a back seat to Burton's deranged ideas- killer clowns, seductive cat women, mutants, an army of penguins, and other nonsense. It's simply too much. The plot is confusing and extremely convoluted, and by the time it's half way through, you just don't care. Wheras the excellent first film had Batman fighting an actual human (though terribly scared), this time Batman spends most of his time killing rampaging circus freaks. The dark, serious, surrealistic, apocalyptic feel of the first film is totally lost here. It's been thrown out the window in favor of pure craziness, Burton-style. Plus, Elfman's score is too light and very dissapointing. But, the few action scenes it has are great, and it does have some standout performances. And it's certainly better than the Kilmer/Clooney crap movies."
4,four and a half stars.,"Though this is the best of all the batman movies, I still can't give it five stars. There were just too many sub-plots for (screenplay writer) Daniel Waters to tie together in its 126 minutes of screen time. True, Tim Burton created a darker atmosphere than his first Batman film, but just how seriously can you take an army of penguins with candy- cane missils tied to there backs? The other thing that saves this movie is Michelle Pfeiffer's role as catwoman. Her relationship with Michael Keaton's Batman was five times more interesting than Kim Basingers helpless character.In fact,I seem to remember rumours that they were considering a Catwoman movie with her as the star.I must stress that if you like your Batman ""campy"" the first two movies aren't for you .All in all, this second movie was Batmans shining moment in tinsle town."
5,"""Gentlemen, start your screaming!""","Danny DeVito makes an execellent Penguine. And Catwoman teams up with the Penguine. Batman (Keaton) fights the two villains and defeats one of them. However, it isn't clear if Catwoman got away or not. One of the better Batman movies."
4,"If you like Batman, you'll have a copy by now.",Burton doesn't give the best commentary in the world. You might be better off saving a little and getting the regular version. Good movie though.
4,Much better than average sequel,"Michael Keaton was a really odd choice to play The Batman, and he brought it off very well. Its a tribute to acting that someone cast so against type could step believably into this type of iconic role and make fans sad that he left it after two pictures.I give Batman Returns four stars instead of five only because it is very hard to match the original film. Jack Nicholson nailed the Joker so well, and the first movie was such a rush of novelty, that the second movie had no chance to capture the same atmosphere so perfectly.Danny Devito does a great job as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer brings an air to Catwoman that Halle Berry could never hope to achieve in her stand-alone follow up. The story has some very cool moments. Unfortunately it also introduced the format of two villains per film, which I felt crowded the last three films of that sequence a bit too much.The DVD presentation is true to the theater experience. It looks and sounds great."
4,One flaw...only,"I really enjoyed this movie, I love the simplicity of the characters and way the scenes edited. Max Shrek being my favorite character. This movie could've done a little more in the realm of Bruce Wayne's character but its good. My only complaint is that this film is obviously filmed on a soundstage. Every scene its just blatant and thats the only downer."
4,Better than Batman,"Don't waste your time with Batman.Just buy Batman returns.It's more mature, more emotional, and above all more believable than Batman.It was made in the early 90's, but many people would pay to see it in 2010 at the theater if It came out today for the 1st time."
3,Batman Returns,"The video I recevied displayed an error "" cannot not play in this area"" It was a big a disappointment to our grandchild for a christmas present. I returned the video on December 31, 2009 & requested a new one. I have not received a credit or a new video."
2,"Oh, no. Not ANOTHER one.","See my review for BATMAN. This is more of the same, only even worse. However, it has Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She single-handedly elevates this into almost worth watching. I still love her, even though this and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY are her two really good roles...and THE RUSSIA HOUSE."
2,It;s too Dark,"I don't what I disliked about this movie the most. The fact that Gothom City looks like a war zone, or the fact that the story's focus is not on Batman again (even though the movie is called Batman) or that the Penquin is the most repulsive one ever created for film. The first movie had Jack Nicolson in it, this one has nothing."
2,Much atmosphere (and a rancid one at that). Little substance.,"Visually stimulating and persistently off-kilter with a few well-acted, stylistically creative scenes (Pfeiffer's return home, the ballroom revelation) but primarily spooky, goofy, and disgusting. Heroism, excitement, and interesting characters are nowhere - and I mean nowhere - to be found.I frequently had to remind myself that I was supposedly enduring a Batman movie. It's hard to remember that when a third of the picture is spent showing a slimy, fanged and flippered midget eat a raw fish whole as the contents of its bowels stream down his chin. All while he's running for mayor. Whee. I completely checked out when they rolled out the all-terrain rubber ducky and the rocket-launching penguins.This film is essentially just two hours of Tim Burton pleasuring himself."
1,Eeeyew!,This movie is disgusting. None of the characters are the least bit interesting and it seems the sole purpose of Danny Devito's Penguin is to be gross. At least the original Batman movie had some wit and decent music. Don't waste your time with this worthless use of videotape.
3,This is a bad sequel,"Batman was okay,but this movie really stunk. I even thought I would like it!They shouldn't have made it so stupid."
4,This movie rocks,The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not as good as the first one. The movie is really good. If you liked the first Batman movie you will have to buy this one.
5,Great,"Those people who gave it one,two, or three stars need to be locked away and shot (well not really) because this movie was great"
3,"Not the best, not the worst, though too grotesque for kids","I am a huge Batman Fan, and I'm honest when I say that it's not very good. Too dark and gruesome for little bat-fans, but not meant for adult audience. Still, it's Batman, and you can't change the past. So, though Returns is not as good as the first, it's better than the worst, Batman and Robin. On a final note, even though the film is disappointing, the movie tie-in is good."
3,A sprawling mess with a great Catwoman!,"Lose the penguin, & I'll give it 4 stars. Lose the Max Schreck power-plant sublot & I'll give it five stars."
5,Powerful and Original: Darkly Beautiful,"A mesmerizing and haunting achievement; a mixture of bold cinematic techniques that reminded me of certain scenes from The Scarlet Empress, or the silent opening of David Lean's Oliver Twist. Marvelous and convincing acting on the part of Danny de Vito, and Christopher Walken and just about everybody else, regardless of the high humour and sustained madness of the narrative. A shining, brilliant and beautiful film. Gripping, entertaining, worth study. I loved it."
3,"Film is Fantastic, the Transfer is Not","This review is not on the movie itself, as Batman Returns is probably in my top 20 all time. I've loved it since I was a kid, and have grown to appreciate it even more as an adult. It's dark, funny, and beautiful to look at. I'd wanted to see this on Blu Ray for years.The Bad News: The transfer is bad. Not terrible, but I didn't feel like I was watching it on Blu Ray, nothing ""pops"" out at you. It looks like a good DVD. There's so many rich colors and set pieces in this film that I couldn't wait to see in High Def, but sadly it just doesn't look that good. I can't imagine they'll re-release this anytime soon with a better transfer, so the $10 is still a good deal in the meantime.The movie itself 10/10The Blu Ray Quality 5/10"
2,"Messy, gory sequel just plain stinks...","Tim Burton returned to direct this sequel to the successful ""Batman,"" but here the premise is too dark and too grisly. Danny DeVito is just okay as the Penguin, but even worse is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Michael Keaton has absolutely nothing to do with his role and this film is mostly just an excuse for Tim Burton to be scary. The plot is absurd, the characters are unconvincing, including Christopher Walken as a minor bad guy. Consequently, Burton did not return to direct the next two films."
2,dissapointing,"this movie was dissapointing. Penguin is my favorite villan of batman. Tim burton ruined his funny image. he also dies!!!! The penguin was also sadistic and cold blooded. The one i'm used to is normal, formal, and funny. how sad."
2,Just as mediocre as the first,"Again, if you're gonna adopt a comic book, stick to it.... If you don't respect the original source (other than minor embellishments), there's no point in making the film. Mel Gibson didn't make Jesus a cyborg, did he? Spielberg didn't make the shark a killer whale in Jaws, right?Just consider a few things...1) The penguin never had flippers, never lived in a sewer and definitely never ate raw fish...2) Why was the Max Shreck (although the name was cool) character even necessary?3)Gotham looks like a fake city, not a real one4) We're asked to believe that Catwoman, in her genesis, survived a fall from a 40 or 50 story building. In the comic book, Catwoman, like Batman, has no super powers whatever. None.That's just for openers. Visually, the film was enjoyable, but as a whole, again, disjointed and pretentious. Why not make a Batman film that's based on the comic? It can still be quite dark, but truer to the source, and likely more enjoyable."
3,Better than the dvd.........,Not a stellar effort from an audio / video perspective but still much better quality than the dvd version. A good version of the Batman lineup but not as good as Batman & Robin in reard to the bluray transfer. The best they could do with what they had to work with - an old print showing signs of age but a fun movie nonetheless.
4,The Best of the First Four,"Okay, all of the first four pale in comparison to 'Batman Begins'. 'Batman Begins' is one of my favorite movies, but I still like this one.The major problem with this movie is that none of the characters are worth caring about. Yes, there is a little sympathy for the Penguin and Batman is still cool, but most of the characters are just dark, brooding people.But enough of what is wrong, I'll talk about what's good. The film is visually stunning. Tim Burton is one of the most visionary directors of our time. The production design of this movie is fantastic. I also really liked the last shot of the movie.The best way to appreciate this movie is to not compare it to 'Batman Begins'. There is no way this can compare to 'Batman Begins' so stop trying. Try comparing it to 'Batman and Robin'. You'll like a lot better."
4,Almost as good as the first one,"While Batman Returns isnt a stone cold classic like 1989's Batman but the fascinating characters and great special effects make Batman Returns one of those movies that you can watch again and again and again,etc. First of all there is a stunning appeal about Michelle Pfeiffer's role in that she is the only one who is any good fighting against Batman.Also its obvious that Selana (same actress as the alter ego) is romantically and sexually lustful of Bruce Wayne.Then there is Danny Devito as The Penguin.He does a pretty impressive job too.I think its actually sort of cute that he sends all those little penguins to do his dirty work.Its like sending kitty cats or bunny rabbits to do the job.The movie isnt as substantial and timeless as the first Batman movie but it is indeed entertaining."
3,Batman Returns,"If its possible to say this - its almost TOO Tim Burton-y.Its overly dark and even though its in the vein of the first Batman, its just too much.Love Pfeiffer."
4,The Return...Good but not as good as the original!!,"This movie was a good continuing story from the first Batman,but I won't say it's better than the original!!Jack Nicholson was the best as a bad guy as you can get,he played the role he was meant to play.Danny Devito does play his part well in this movie,and Catwomen by Michelle Pfeiffer well done.A must see, I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!!"
2,Far better resources available,"It covers a lot of topics but I did find it particularly helpful in any way. The idea of gathering all the information about I/O into one book to use as a single resource is nice, but this book doesn't do a good job. Not that much help in explaining things and no help at all as far as practical examples went. You will learn much more from general Java books and Google searches."
1,I'd pass on this one.,"This book does a fair job of covering the topic. I found it semi-useful. I would not recommend it however. Other books give you more value for the money. I would recommend the Java Tutorial series or; Just Java 2 by Peter Van der Linden, those are great learning books. They give you real value for your money. They do a great job of helping you learn what you need to, to get your programming assignments done at work. The Sun Java website has also been very helpful to me. There, you can find anything you need to without wasting 50 bucks for a book that does not help you that much."
4,"Good, with useful examples, but needs some corrections","The book is good, complete and shows you the details of I/O for Java (you should be at least an intermediate programmer); however, there are some errata that you must check in the web page of O'Reilly.You can download the code of examples from the web page, and this code is corrected (it compiles and run), but some examples in the book are not: If you write down the code directly from the book you'll realize the problems.I bought it in in mid 2001, but the corrections were not yet included in the edition I got, so supose you'll have to include them. Nevertheless, after doing it, you'll have a good book to study and use the I/O capabilities of Java."
3,book is plague with typos!,"Actually, I did not give a rating to the book. The book is plague with typos and errors, some of them required to rewrite a whole code example. I bought the second printing and was disappointed.My suggestion is to wait for later printings when all the errors have been fixed."
5,Excellent treatment of an area usually taken for granted,"I'm a C++ programmer that has given himself a crash-course in Java for a project at work. If I had this book earlier, I would have gotten things done a lot faster. Every programmer should be familiar with input and output streams, but how many can say they know the in's and out's of Java's cryptographic streams and piped streams? If asked, could you tell the difference between a BufferedWriter and a PrintWriter? I had to use three books to accumulate the knowledge I could have gained by just reading this one book. If you are a beginning or intermediate Java programmer, don't assume you know everything about Java I/O and what it can do; check out the pearls of wisdom in this book. Needless to say, now I'm writing much better I/O-related Java code because of it, and I believe you will too."
4,Not what you think it is...,"While this book is absolutely gorgeous, it isn't a book *about* costume rendering. It's not a how-to book, but I'll add that it's a wonderful book for inspiration. The text portion (that I find is often skipped over in favor of looking at the pretty pictures) is worth a read as well, since it goes into some detail on various costumers' processes. Good book, but not an essential read for costume students."
4,Review of Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters,"As a student in costume design, I found this book to be of great interest and indeed help in gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges facing costume designers.The writing documents interviews of 18 professionals who tell about their lives and careers, the joys and difficulties of costume designing and the odd tip for aspiring studentsThe designer's sketches are plentiful and in glorious colour and while the book would not suit as a text book for costume design methodology it is an excellent source of inspiration."
3,"Pullman perfect, HBO sells him short",HBO needs to stick to showing other people's movies and give up on making their own. Bill Pullman (While You Were Sleeping) gives it his best shot in this unrealistic movie of a cop holding prisoners at gun point in a courtroom and letting the whole world see it on television. It's a sad sign of the times. Another great actor that didn't get used well was Robert Loggia (Big). Great talent needs to work to become better. This movie justs makes you wish they didn't have to do movies like this to perfect their craft.
4,Memoir of the highest order,"Elegantly written with a cadence all its own, William Alexander Percy's memoir provides an unreconstructed view of another time. Percy's sense of the dying southern aristocracy and the corresponding decline of his place in the South represents a vivid picture of life on the Delta for the large planter class. Percy's South required his life to be governed by a sense of noblesse oblige, but through his eyes one can watch this notion slowly wither away. For the unprepared, beware, Percy does not lack for ego, but this might be expected from one who felt the position he held required him to heed to a higher code. If you enjoy true southern literature then you will find this memoir highly satisfying."
2,One man's biography,I didn't know this was going to be a one man biography....had expected more detail of Mississippi and the south over this period of time.
2,Over hyped,"I've heard great things about this book, but it simply doesn't live up to the reviews. It isn't vivid, isn't absorbing, isn't all that interesting. It is a decent piece of period biography, and if you're interested in the Percy family or the region or time period, it might be worthwhile. Otherwise, give this one a pass."
3,Not Impressed,"This is my first book about planters and plantation life. It was my expectation that the author would give more specific information about plantation finances and management. This subject is hardly touched upon. He does briefly give his opinions about slavery, but there is nothing unique about it. Basically, this is a nice, slow look back at a bygone time, but it left me wondering how the heck did these people come about, and maintain or eventually lose their wealth."
1,What a wate of my time,"Look, I'm used to movies like ""Better than chocolate"", ""Listen"", ""Gia"", Monster, series like ""The L word"", real good lesbian stuff. When I got this movie thinking it was a good lesbian drama, I was completly dissapointed. Boring, unrealistic, stupid... do not waste your time/money. The real lesbian of the movie ends up with a guy, and the main characters were so boring! oh god! I still regret I watched it. Hey, if you wanna see a lesbian movie that has never been properly discovered, buy ""Listen"", it's only a VHS version, but it's hot, great lesbian thriller... reminds me of Basic Instinct but better."
1,Not enjoyable,"The reviews here reveal that some people found pleasure in this film. Unfortunately, I do not find myself among them. I could not wait for it to end. I watched the whole thing only because I had paid to rent it, but it was mostly a painful experience.No one is really connected to anyone in this film. Almost all the characters seem narcissistic and flippant. There are so many characters introduced who are carrying zany, personal issues, and we are supposed to care about these. But the reader has no motivation to care, due to the disorganized storyline.The attempt to create a warm reunion of people who care about each other falls short. None of the characters have much heart, and there are even several face-slapping scenes! The only appealing character was the young nerdy woman, who appears briefly. Please, let us have more well-written films with appealing characters."
1,This maybe the worst movie EVER!!!,"I don't even know how I got through this movie. The characters are one-demensional, the plot is non-exsistant. I think this is what my grandmother used to call dreck!! Seriously, stay far, far away!!!"
1,THIS SUCKED,I just don't know what to say other than save your money. This movie was just pure nonsense. I wish I could've given it zero stars.
2,April's Shower,It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with.
1,too has been,Unfortunatly the bad (actors) actresses make us forget the interest of the subject : the coming out and the fun of some situations.
2,Bad bad bad writing..,It starts out kinda interesting but later it turns out to be like the third season of the l word.. it has its funny moments but some of the scenes go way too over the top.. the only thing worth watching would be the chick who plays Alex (the maid of honor) =)
1,Yuck! This sets back the women's movement 100 years...,"I'm not a ""libber"" but I was certainly not happy that this story-teller proudly declared a woman's place is serving her husband.I expected to read about dreaming techniques and instead had to find my way through a convoluted telling of this woman's childhood dreaming experiences, how she came to meet her ""Dark Lord,"" how the earth shook when they made love and how fulfilled she is supporting her husband's mission to lead the Yaqui nation.What a crock. If you're interested in developing Yaqui dreaming techniques, read Carlos Castanada's books instead. Although the ""exercises"" described in them are difficult and required a very long time to achieve success, they are effective and do work."
4,Very handy for use at home or at work,"The product works very well, but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone. Overall, I would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting. Great buy for the price."
2,VERY FRAGILE!,"I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged."
4,pretty good,"i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires. and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40! so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing. the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device. i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why. it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more. so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all."
1,"Nice idea, but...","To her credit, Grace Slick doesn't try to paint herself as particularly likeable or mature. Her book is poorly written, as if by a 16-year old. What also struck me as odd is how the book says relatively little about the music that was the focus of Ms. Slick's life. It spends a lot of time talking about the various excesses that her fame allowed her to indulge in. These topics might be interesting to teens, or to hardcore Airplane fans, but for anyone else there are much better books to buy and read."
4,No punches pulled here!,"Grace was my 1st musical idol; I ended up a professional musician/writer to this day (I'm 58!) because of the influence this woman's talent had on my life. She writes very candidly and you get a real sense of the person behind the fame and the media gossip. She gives great insight on the music business back then (still crappy, but in a far less creative way!) and the way her era changed music - and lifestyle - forever!"
4,Interesting,"This is Grace Slick, writing about her life, albeit with a co-writer; how could it not be interesting? Check out White Rabbit on Youtube while you read this."
2,Disappointed in the surface treatment of events,"I read the book in two days and while it contained a few items of interest, I was disappointed in the lack of detail in many areas. I would have been really interested to hear Grace Slick talk about the Haight Ashbury days, how the Airplane dealt with the record company business, or the sessions and live appearances that led to some of their great songs. One would think that a woman whose songs were inspired by the likes of Lewis Carroll and James Joyce would have a deeper perspective than this book shows, but maybe not. I think a lot of the blame has to go to Andrea Cagan who most likely told her to make sure to tell her sexual experiences with famous rock stars if nothing else. In any case the editing should have been a lot better; the book is kind of a rambling mess. But for fans of Grace and the Airplane and '60s rock music in general, it's still an interesting read for all its faults."
3,an easy book to read-couldn't put it down!,"I enjoyed reading this book but was kind of disappointed that it didn't go into much detail and kind of jumps around. If you've read it once though you've read it 1,000 times, if you can remember the '60s you didn't live them:) But its a fun to read autobiography"
3,Entertaining and readable,"A good book - light and entertaining. I enjoyed it a lot; though, I must confess, after I started the chapters about the Jefferson Starship period I kind of lost interest. I was more interested in the 60s Woodstock adventure . . . having not lived through it myself I found Grace's stories really personal and and it gave me a good idea of what times must have been like then. Made me sorry I missed it!I recommend this book if you're looking for a first-hand account of the evolution of the 60s told by someone who is really down-to-earth. You can't help but love Grace!The book was full of little inside moments too, such as the meaning behind ""Our House"" by Crosby, Stills, and Nash. It made the songs seem more real to me after I heard stories of the people who had written them.Pick it up sometime and browse through it - you'll find some great inside scoop; read the whole thing, however, and you may find your mind wandering a little."
3,"Too much Slick, not enough Airplane","Grace Slick's memoir is an unvarnished look at the rock star life of one of the music's toughest babes. But it's a bit too '60s for its own good. Slick was either too lazy when she wrote this, or too out of it back in the '60s when it all happened to remember much, but she doesn't describe enough of what it was like to be a member of one of psychedelia's most important bands. Her flippant personality comes through, but one wants more about the relationships that permeated the Airplane and its watered-down successor bands, Jefferson Starship and Starship. Still, what's here is a quaint look back."
2,Not all that I hoped for!,"Overall I'd say this book was mildly interesting. I'd hoped for a lot more discussion and details about rock n'roll in the 60s but what I wound up with was pretty much a hodge-podge of disjointed events. Grace also has a tendency to promote her personal social and political agendas which gets tiring.Since I picked it up at the local library, at least I didn't have to shell out any cash!"
2,Lame and Disappointing,"This book contained no information about Grace Slick that I found interesting. I am only twenty, but I have been a Jefferson Airplane fan for several years. I was very excited to see the book published and then disappointed with the outcome. Slick and Cagan left out important parts of Slick's life, music, and relationships. I put down the book wanting more and even a little bit confused. The writers skip from one decade to the next while referring to events unknown to the reader and not even mentioned within the pages. Hopefully next time that Grace Slick publishes her memoirs, she will be more specific and organized."
1,Airplane Goddess Crashes,"Grace Slick didn't even get off of the runway. I don't buy a lot of autobiographies. I bought this one because Janis is dead and only she and Grace have a right to write about 60s and 70s San Francisco rock from the female perspective.The woman who created such wonders as White Rabbit and Lather has worked up a bunch of meaningless bubbles for this thin thin thin work. Perhaps that's what happens when you stop drinking and doing dope.Ms. Cagan, who is listed as a ""contributor"", but is described more as an editor-compiler deserves some of the credit for this totally incoherent and slipshod piece of trash.Wait for the movie and hope China Kantner plays her mom."
5,One of Holt's best,"The focus here is on creative approaches to learning (and I absolutely don't mean happy faces and cute cartoons) in the classroom, and I don't know of a better book in this line. Can be useful regardless of your teaching methods. Also offers Holt's theory of learning which is also persuasive and useful. Holt knew and loved children, and was incredibly intelligent in his approach. Get this book if you're a teacher--or a parent, because these ideas can stimulate the whole family.Alan Nicoll"
2,Disappointing,"I had heard great things about John Holt and was really disappointed in this book. Maybe part of it was that after reading about Charlotte Mason and reading books by John Gatto, it didn't seem so revolutionary to me. But Holt quoted psychologist Robert Liang extensively in this book, which to me seems like the most outdated psychobabble (granted this book was written quite awhile ago), saying if you make ____ mistake with your kids they may turn out schizophrenic!He then continues on with different teaching techniques, which is also surprising since the unschooling movement generally refer to him as the source of their inspiration, but say you should not ""teach"" children, letting them learn as they become motivated to do so. So if you're looking for unschooling information you won't find it here. It also has odd references like to a school in which teachers express anger to the students to make things ""real"" and children seem to be allowed to hit each other sometimes."
4,"Good, not great, but still unmistakeably TPOH.","A letdown for me after Love Junk and One Sided Story. There's still some good material and some wry observations from Moe and crew, but the songwriting is a bit spottier and the sound is more arena based, and less inventive than in the past. I'd still buy it, no problem!"
2,Her girlish scribbles,"Louisa May Alcott wrote this sugary book when she was only seventeen, and you can really tell from the writing. Her heroine Edith is beautiful, noble, humble, a perfect musician and singer, and everyone worships her; ditto with the hero, who has been nursing a broken heart until he sees Edith.The plot is very predictable and kind of boring. Basically the bad girl called Ida is trying to wreck Edith's life so she can marry the hero, and everyone finds out the truth about Edith's parentage. Lots of syrupy speeches and gooey looks and oh-so-noble pale men with wilting lily women. It's all very cliched, as if Alcott had to get the romantic novels of the day out of her system. I love Louisa May's fiction so much, but this was a youthful dud.On a small side note, there was a really wonderful version of this movie out in the late 90s, which only sort of resembles the book, and it's on DVD here on amazon! So check that out instead."
3,A typical love story with an obvious conclusion.,"The Inheritance was much like other love stories, with good triumphing over Evil. However, it was easy reading and contained good character descriptions and believable circumstances. Anyone who agrees (or disagrees) and would like to help me review this book for school, please e-mail your thoughts."
3,Slightly different from what I expected...,This book was actually quite intriguing. It has only been the second novel by Louisa May Alcott that I have read; the first being Little Women. I believe this book is a great introduction into the more romantic writings of Louisa May Alcott. I would highly recommend it to all. It is very easy to read.
4,"For one of Alcott's firsts, very good.","This book was good, but it was a little TOO perfect and predictable. The main character was just so sweet and perfect and pretty, and everyone loved her so much except for one person, the family's cousin who was jealous of her. The main character is a poor Italian orphan who has been adopted by a rich family because they felt bad for her. Lord Percy, the family's friend, meets her and falls in love with her, but he knows that she will never marry a man above her rank. Towards the end, the main character realizes that her father was actually a rich man who was related to a relative of her adoptive family, which entitles her to lots of money.Despite the unrealistic perfectness of the main character, this book is a very enjoyable read. If nothing else, check it out at the library, but I plan to buy it when I get the money."
5,Nicest and Purest of Alcott's Romances,"Influenced by the melodrama of the contemporary theater and the popular gothic novels of the time, Louisa May Alcott weaves a tale far removed from the reality of her everyday life in Boston. With a charm reminiscent of Jane Austen's novels, The Inheritance sets love and courtesy against depravity and dishonor--and with the help of a secret inheritance, allows virtue to prevail."
4,Great book to curl up by the fire with,"It was more like a movie than anything else; each time I put the book down I was afraid I'd miss a really good part. For her first novel, I'd say that LMA did a good job, though her later writings are much better. I wouldn't suggest this book for an introduction to LMA, unless you promise to read some of her later writings also. This is a must-read (and must-have!) for all LMA fans, and a collection of her novels isn't complete with out it."
1,BAD,I can see why it wasn't originally published. The main character was to sweet and nice. I couldn't stand her! Don't waste your time on this book. Read one of L.M. Alcott's more popular fictional works.
3,a very 19th century romance...VERY,"It's not a bad book, it's just that it's...typical. And not typical Alcott: typical 1800s romance. Edith is passive, good, and beautiful - the triple whammy of the melodramatic heroine. All the classic trappings are here - from the conniving rival to the lost inheritance (hence the title.) But if you can stomach all that, it's not a bad book. Alcott, even at this young age, is an engaging writer. And yes, one can see the buds of her later writing style - with an emphasis on family and self-sacrifice. It simply surprised me that Alcott - no conformist herself - would write such a stereotypical character as Edith. The value of this book is mainly because Alcott wrote it - not because it's a memorable book in its own right. I finished this book in one swallow. Too bad there wasn't more to chew..."
4,Great Reference,"This reference is certainly one of the best available. The author includes a CD with examples from the book, however the sample pages are very juvenile and difficult to look at. These pages are almost insulting to a professional Web designer. But, if you don't get hung up on the poor quality of the CD, the book itself is well written and complete, although I would like to see more short examples of syntax and usage for every tag. If I knew how to apply the tag, I would not be looking it up."
4,All (90%) what a Webmaster need's,"This book is a great help for Webmaster and Internet application developer. This book is easy to use and easy to understand (the great help for it are many samples).The only thing what lack's this book is the notes for every tag or function about the browser. Because we all know, that some tags and functions we use only for MSIE and some only for NN. This is a little bit confusing to try run on NN a tag, what should be used only for MSIE."
2,So where's the hot stuff?,"Not what I had hoped for to say the least! While I realize that this is Amazon and not hard core central, this film did nothing for me at all.The 'sex' scenes were over way to quickly. There was way too little for-play and not much to the actual act either. There was female nudity, but no male parts (except for an occasional arse.) The implication of various acts was there, but they did nothing to heat the blood.Still, if you want to see an 'ehh' movie with some humor and lots of naked lovelies and only 90 min...well, be my guest."
5,Great Series!,"Would highly recommend for your library. Enjoyed the teachings and it holds much truth. History Channel rarely disappoints, so this holds true to their work. Enjoy."
4,Worth it,"Slightly repetitive at times ( mostly with the intro they used for all 7 segments ), but on the whole a very well-made miniseries that is definitely worth watching. I especially liked how didn't restrict themselves to any one religion and also included a scientific approach when interpreting each sin."
5,I LOVE THE HISTORY CHANNEL !,"Everything History is great and this channel and every program on it I love & watch....usually with my jaw dropped through half of the episode but still haha. Every sin depicted in the show is substantiated by the so many scholors & official people who are speaking of the way it is and the way it was. I ALSO RECOMMEND ""Ancient Aliens"" by The History Channel... I bought that one DIRECTLY.. It will amaze and shock you people who 'barely' know."
1,Do not order!!!!!,"Nasty!!! I bought other Oskri bars that I really like. I took a couple of bites of this one and I thought that I was going to throw up. I had to get a napkin and spit it out. I have 17 of them left if anyone want them and want to pay the postage they can have them----just that bad.What made the matter even worse was that Amazon don't refund on this item. I will have to go to Oskri and ask for a return.This is the first time that I have been unhappy with my order from Amazon. I thought that if it was comming from amazon then I thought you could return it to them. I thought if you ordered from a merchant that send the product to you, that you have to return it to them and I understood that however these are awful. I f they would have let me do no stars I would have. All I can say is yuck"
2,bad sugar taste,it's very dry and super sweet(sugar taste not the natural dates taste). i had to pitch most of them and wouldn't recommend it at all.
2,Good for Proj. Managers & M.Sc. (C.I.S.)Thesis Candidates,"You know, these two groups of fellas don't need detail code samples to work on, VISIO is ALL other tool they'll need, :-D (plus they probably won't understand a line of code anyway.)But for a Developer who ALREADY knows the background concepts, skip this, start with Wrox's Prof DNA if you still need to work on non- .Net 3-tiers stuffs."
2,Good COM+ but biased explanation,"It is clear that Sessions is biased toward COM+. I would have no problem with that if he were up front about it. The book provides some good COM+ insights and recommendations, but it is like going to Starbucks and asking them their favorite coffee shop."
5,Truth,"Magnificent fragrance! Not recommended for those who are sensitive to high scents, will definitely induce a headache."
3,I can't test my item,"Thanks but the item is no arrive to Colombia, because in the company losted the package. I m very sad in this moment."
3,White Florals Too Much,"There is something about the white florals in many of the CKs that just doesn't agree with me. Sadly, Truth is another in a long line of CK fragrances that I like but can't wear. This time, it's the lily which is amplified on my skin, becoming cloying, sweet, & headache-y.Otherwise, Truth is a superb scent & very under-rated, imo. On the one hand, it's a bright green floral; on the other, it's a deep woody oriental. Complex & interesting, I think Truth would be fabulous as an office scent in the winter. It's not for those who like sugar & cupcakes. Rather, Truth is for those who like classic scents but want something more modern & up-to-date, even a bit atypical and off-center yet not jarring and demanding. That's Truth, even if it is a pretentious name."
4,great value,"these little suckers have some punch, plus some accuracy, and I am a jazz/classical listenter, not overly enamored by bass gimmicks"
5,a sweeping and penetrating masterpiece,"This first of 3 volumes in Deutscher's biography is an astonishing and captivating achievement. Deutscher weaves together character study, drama, and historical narrative to give an authoritative account of Trotsky's life and the Russian Revolution from Trotsky's birth up through the quickening bureaucratization of Soviet Russia in 1921.Deutscher's deft handling of the facts, personalities, ideas, and situations of the time is simply unparallelled, and makes for a tremendously enjoyable and informative read.Essential material for anyone exploring the question of where socialism went wrong in the 20th century."
4,"Brian Wayne Wells, Esquire, reviews ""The Prophet Armed""","This is the first volume of Isaac Deutscher's defining biography of Leon Trotsky, the great Russian revolutionary and one of the founders of the Soviet State. This three-volume work remains Isaac Deutscher's great opus.Covering the years from his birth in 1879 until the opening stages of Trotsky's struggle with Kamenev, Zinoviev and Stalin for leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this volume is an exciting entre into the three-volume series.Isaac Deutscher, obviously, believes in what he writes about. He has a great deal of interest in explaining the details of the struggle that developed between Stalin and Trotsky. Consequently this first volume may give somewhat short shrift to the most productive period of Trosky's life while the author manuveres to tell the story he really wants to tell in the secon and third volumes."
5,amazeing band,everything ive ever heard from this band is just amazeing. what [stinks] is its next to impossible to find there cds but if you do ever have a chance to hear this band they will just absolutely blow you away. If your a metal fan you owe it to your self to check out this band its like nothing you've ever heard before.
5,AMAZING,I simply cannot put words together for how good this album is. Every song is nonstop entertainment. Great great great beats..
3,Missing Track,"Amazon's MP3 versoion of this album is missing the track called Visions of Nasca, which can be found on itunes.Bad amazon....I shop amazon because they are cheaper than itunes. Hopefully this isn't a regular thing."
5,The Twentieth Century's Best Book on the Middle Ages,"What had been intended as an account of the traveling scholar-clerics of medieval times outgrew its original purpose to become a history of the preservation of the poetic impulse, from the decay of antiquity up to the eve of the Renaissance. ""The Wandering Scholars"" is not only a significant contribution to scholarly knowledge, but is itself a work of pure poetry, made all the more poignant in our own day by knowledge of the tragic fate that awaited the author. The buyer should be warned, though: although the book created a publishing sensation when it appeared in 1927, finding enthusiastic admirers ranging from the ranks of the University to the inmates of His Majesty's prisons, the steady decline of educational standards may render the book difficult for the general reader of today, and even the best-prepared could spend a lifetime exploring the many levels of meaning and allusion in Miss Waddell's pioneering work of genius."
1,"Too Short, Too Rushed, Kinda Pretentious","I blame myself for not looking more closely at the product description and reviews, but I was in a hurry and at work when I clicked ""buy"" -- Was surprise how short the program was, and found the lengthy ad at the beginning HIGHLY annoying. The instructor moves to quickly thru the exercises so I never felt I was able to really get deeply into any of the poses -- his explanations of poses was also often to rushed and incomplete -- and overall, I found his style overly earnest and yoga-pretentious. Was quite disappointed."
2,Disappointed,I love Rodney Yee's DVDs. This one however fell short of my expectations. I ordered it because I had pulled some muscles in my back and thought the exercises would help to relieve my pain. I was mistaken. It made the pain even worse. I couldn't sleep because the pain was so bad. I went back to the AM yoga routine by Rodney(AM/PM Yoga) which did help to relieve my pain little by little.
3,Back care,"This is an excellent program for the back and if followed precisely, you will find complete satisfaction as far as your back is concerned. Kind of gets boring after a while and you may want to turn the volume down."
4,Perfect for a sore back,This is a great set of exercises to strengthen your back. Video lasts only ~20 minutes. My only criticism is I cant find a way to fast forward to the beginning of the exercises so I have to wait through 3-4 minutes of Gaiam advertisements.
4,Great for yoga-phobics with bad backs,"I bought this for my partner who hates yoga and has a bad back and who has practiced to this DVD on a regular basis and says it really helps the back pain. HOWEVER, if you are at all flexible, this is not the DVD for you. This is strictly for beginning yogis who need some great stretches for back strengthening/flexibility."
2,Back Care Yoga A Waste of Money,"I was really disappointed by this DVD. My acupuncturist had recommended that I try a Rodney Yee video, but I don't think he knows that this is mostly fluff--there's lots of advertising and talking, but only 20 minutes of actual yoga. So as a yoga session, it's just too short to be of much use except for absolute beginners--but it's clearly not aimed at them, as Rodney uses poses that true beginners would not already know, and does not instruct in how to do them.More important, the yoga exercises are too short. The program is 90% stretching, but the stretches are not held long enough to be effective. The poses are also too brief. And there are not enough of them--real back work involves strengthening back and abdominal core, but there are only a few poses in this program that do that.Based on this DVD, I will not buy anything from this source: it feels like a moneymaker scam to me."
1,Backcare Yoga for Beginner,The worst Yoga dvd I have ever bought. There is no audio instruction. You watch the same move over and over. It does not even give time to change from position to position. I like to follow video to exercise. You can definitely not do this. I don't know what's point of this video.
1,Backcare Yoga for Beginners,This product is garbage and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves even allowing it to be sold on line to unsuspecting customers.
4,Short pillow cases,"I liked the sheets, they were very nice. However, the pillow cases were too small for queen size pillows. They weren't long enough to cover the end of the pillows."
5,Unique and Informative,This book traces the ancient roots of Freemasonry through the ages. It is awesome in it's depth. A truly fascinating history of Freemasonry from a very different perspective.
5,Great Hat,Overall I like the product and it has great durability which is a great asset for everything I do. It's lasted me almost a year now which is probably the longest out of any hat I've ever had.
5,I just want to return it. I haven't even open it yet,"To whom do I send this book back to. I just got back from my parent's house and I found this book in my mail box. How can I return it to you and get my money back? I ""have"" not even open it yet, so please let me know ASAP, how can I return this book, and to whom do I return this book to?Thank You, Stephen Dodson"
5,The true facts about the Free State of Jones,"For me, the best history books are ones that show us how the great movements in history affect (and bring out the best in) everyday people who are just trying protect their families, live by their guiding principles, and get by in the world. Dr. Bynum's book does a great job of explaining what actually happened in Jones County, who these people really were, why they did what they did, and what the consequences were. The book also challenges the stereotypical view of Southerners, which is very welcome. Anyone intrigued by the Free State of Jones story will find this a refreshing, factual account of what really happened."
1,Disappointment,"The Free State of Jones by Victoria E. Bynum Used paperback bookIt was perhaps my own misunderstanding of the book's content, but I ordered the book expecting a break down of family names and their desention into mixing the races. What it was, was a general history of segragation and intergration which can be found in any Mississippi History book. There was only one page in the book that even mentions any of my family's names Pg.202. I will either resale the book or destroy it.The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War"
