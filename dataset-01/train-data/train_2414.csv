2,Not as powerful as I wanted,"All the reviews talked about two batteries being enclosed so I purchased this mainly for the batteries and the charger to add to my trimmer. I guess at this time there is only one battery enclosed. It was what I honestly expected, not nearly as powerful as the very cheapest corded electric blower. So, if you want an extra battery and charger for any of the other items, this is for you but don't expect much from this item."
4,Great service!,This product arrived on time & in the condition advertised. It was a gift so I have not been able to try it out myself.
1,Worst Item From Black & Decker,This by far is the worst item from Black & Decker that i've ever purchased. Fully charged batteries last no more than 5-9 minutes of run time. In my opinion STAY AWAY from this item.
2,Is this tool sole purpose to drain a battery?,"Yes it is! Although I like and would recommend Black and Decker's 19"" Cordless Lawnmower and their NST2018 Grasshog 12"", this cordless broom drains batteries in a couple of minutes or so. It's blowing power is pretty good for it's size.I would not recommend it."
4,Where is the Second Battery??,"I always read the reviews to help me make a decision before making a purchase. Many reviews refer to a SECOND battery or EXTRA BATTERY INCLUDED. This unit, however, only came with ONE battery. Broom does a good job for light work. I would have rated item 5 stars had it not been for the missing expected battery."
3,Black & Decker Hard Surface Electric Blower,"Very lightweight and very easy to manuver. However, it doesn't have the velocity or the staying power of it's heavier 12 volt lead acid battery cousin with the convenient storage and charging cradle.With this model, the removable battery slips into a seperate charger so you have to find a place for the charger while charging. Next, when you need to use it, you have to get the battery, insert it and then go. Further there's no provision for storing or hanging either the blower or the charger.With a little more thought, it could have been designed to mirror it's 12 volt cousin and still have the removable battery plus the charging/storage cradle with the included external charging cradle as an option. For the cost, it should have included both the charger and a second 18V battery.As is typical of NiCad batteries, within a few seconds it does not have the same initial velocity nor does it last as long as the 12 volt model.Does the job as stated. Three stars."
2,Don't buy...wait for the new one coming soon,"This is a nice little blower for cleaning up the driveway and sidewalks after a mowing...for the first year. The reviews you've seen about the battery being essentially useless after one year of use are absolutely true. After the first season, you'll be lucky to get 5 minutes of working time. However, be patient...B&D is releasing a new 36v lithium ion battery blower/vac in ""late Spring 2012"" that should offer much better batter life and power, plus a vaccum for hard surfaces (not intended for lawns and flower beds). It should be a huge upgrade over this blower, albeit at a higher price point ($120-$150 ish). See their website at [...] for more info. Based on my experience with their new 36v string trimmer (same battery), the extra money and wait will be VERY worth it."
3,cordless broom,I received this item very promptly as always from Amazon. It is light weight and easy to use it has an ample charge time but only has one speed. Would have liked it to have a little more power. I am 77 years old with arthritis so not able to use a larger blower as they are too heavy to use for any length of time. Good for sidewalks but won't work as a leaf blower.
4,B&D CORDLESS BROOM,"This product does exactly what I want it to do. I use it to quickly blow away light debris from my pool deck, driveway and sidewalk. While the battery life is not great, at least there are two which is sufficient to complete the tasks I purchased it for. I have another blower which is much more robust, but requires a cord. This is a big hassle when you only need a quick daily sweep. I also purchased one of these for my 80-something mother who has found it easy to operate."
4,Easy and useful.,"For a cordless, this blower is fairly powerful and does a good job without raising as much dust as the gas powered blowers and also it is much lighter and less polluting. The battery runs down fairly quickly if you're using it for a large area so it's good to have a backup battery which is very easy to change."
1,Short Battery Life Makes It Useless,I bought this item expecting to blow debris around my very small lot. The battery would only run 5 to 7 minutes on a full charge. Don't buy it.
4,Battery runs out in 10-15 minutes,It's a handy tool except that the battery lasts for 10-15 minutes only. So keep 2-3 spare batteries.
4,great broom weak blower,Fabulous for sweeping dirt out of the garage. Too weak to blow leaves off the porch. It's good it comes with 2 batteries since 1 doesn't last too long.
4,Works for me,"I bought the blower to clean leaves from the public tennis court, so I had to have a battery charged device. It works very well for my purpose. The charge lasts between 15 and 20 minutes. If you need more than that, this is probably not a good choice."
2,low battery life,"my mom had a B&D; cs100(3 or 4 years old)i replaced it with a B&D; ns118,the salesperson told me the battery life was not very good but i boughtit because of the light weight--after about six months i am replacing itwith a B&D; cs100(if it didnt have a back up battery it would have beengone a long time ago----just doesnt have the power the cs100 hasi have a B&D; cs100 that is several years old and it works very good--gottired of cussing at the cord"
4,Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Broom Hard Surface Sweeper #NS118,"Very helpful tool for around the house. The battery will last a couple of minutes of running time. That will give you enough time to leaf-blow a small area or small back yard. The only drawback in addition to a low battery life, is no ability to vary speed of airflow. I recommend buying it for small areas only."
5,Very pleased with Cordless Broom,"The Black & Decker 18-volt Cordless Broom #NS118 is perfect for blowing leaves from my pool deck and driveway between gardener visits. It is not powerful enough to do heavy leaf blowing, but that is not my need. Each of the two batteries lasts almost 15 minutes, and I need the full load of two of them to do the job for my front yard and then my back yard, so there is some inconvenience of having to charge both before starting on the second yard. Alternating days takes care of that annoyance. But, the unit is light weight, easy to use, not very noisy, and meets my needs perfectly. I have not had it long enough to judge whether it will be trouble free."
4,Good Cordless Broom,Not a bad price. I mostly bought this for the two extra batteries. I have the weed eater/trimmer and sometimes two batteries just are not enough to get everything trimmed. But one batteries is plenty for the cordless broom and it does a good job of blowing the grass off the driveway and sidewalk.
5,B&D Cordless Blower excellent,"Had already bought the newer 18v cordless B&D; weed trimmer (had an older model with lesser voltage battery and much bigger battery) and it works great, so thought I'd try the cordless blower. I have a corded model that works well, but, as we all know the power cord is real pain.Cordless blower very powerful for what I need it for - blowing leaves and grass around the yard to corral for lawnmower pick-up. Having the extra 18v from the weed trimmer helps as the blower seems to use the battery power quicker than the weed trimmer.I just hope these batteries last better than the older version ones as they say these can stay pugged in to keep their power without affecting performance.Even with the potential for battery issues (just make sure you've always got a fresh one or two) I highly recommend both B&D; pieces and may now look to buy the cordless hedge trimmer.Ted"
4,Black & Decker Cordless Hard Surface Electric Broom,The broom worked as advertised. I use it to blow leaves and debris from my pool area. I get 2 to 3 uses on a charge.
2,Terrible Battery Life,"Got his product a year ago, since beginning the battery life is very poor and only last for few minutes, same thing with the reserve battery."
2,"I know, sour grapes, but disappointed","The battery is so poor it makes the produce almost useless. As green as I am, I have considered buying a gas or corded blower... How sad is that?"
3,Disappointed with power output,I was hoping that it would blow cut grass from my sidewalks to the grass; however it does not do a very good job. It does not clear the height of the grass bed very well. I'm back to taking a garage broom and sweeping the sidewalks.
3,Blower OK but battery failed,"I got this for my wife in November 2010 for small jobs when she didn't want to haul out the big electric corded blower. I purchased an extra battery pack.The unit works fine, but now in February 2011 one of the battery packs has failed (it won't take a charge). The unit is out of the Amazon return warranty, but Black and Decker warrants the battery for 2 years.I am now in the process of trying to return the battery to Black and Decker for a replacement.I will update this review when I finish dealing with Black and Decker.Only three stars now because of the failed battery; if I had not bought two batteries I would be out of luck."
2,Great concept really weak execution!,"When it is fully charged, it does exactly what it says it does and does it well. However the full charge only lasts about 10 - 15 minutes and then it is too weak to be effective. I can blow off my concrete walkway and a little more than half of my concrete driveway before it dies. It handles about 2/3 of my 14'x30' deck and then has to charge for about 4 hours before I can do the rest. Also, as others noted, it only ships with 1 battery, making it very frustrating. Also, I did try it for blowing out gutters just as a test, and it can't move the leaves out even at full charge. I wasn't expecting it to work for that, but just to let others know. As much as I hate dragging a cord around I will be going back to my electric blower and a manual broom/rake."
3,Black and Decker Cordless Broom,"You can grab it and use it often for miscellaneous quick cleanup of grass, leaves, straw, etc. It's very convenient because it's cordless. However, don't get rid of your corded blower! The keyword in the description is ""broom"". This ""broom"" does not have the velosity of a corded blower. Stick with a large corded blower if you need to clear a lot of material such as accumulated leaves, straw, small sticks or acorns from your driveway or sidewalks."
4,Just what I needed,"I have a short driveway, only about 150 feet so it doesn't take long to clean. However I have many trees of many different kinds and some always seem to be shedding leaves, flowers, or seeds, so I find it necessary to clean my driveway at least once a week and often every day. The B&D Cordless Broom is perfect for this as there is no cord to unwrap and re-wrap. It also works fine for clearing leaves from the roof, and the gutters. Also not near as noisy as my old corded blower which hasn't much more power than the Cordless Broom."
5,Perfect for hard surfaces,"This sweeper is perfect for sidewalks, driveways, etc...has just the right power for this task. It struggles a little blowing leaves across a lawn, though. Another convenient player in the B&D 18-volt universal battery tool arsenal. A winner."
4,perfect for small jobs,"We have the ""big guy"" blower, but for quick easy jobs, this is the one. I really appreciate the second battery, the light weight, and less noise. It comes apart for easy storage too."
4,Works good for flat surfaces,Better then using a broom to sweep grass & dirt after mowing lawn or just blowing off the dust things.Light weight too.
4,Just What I needed!,"Have had this product for about a month and am very satisfied. I also have the edger which came with 2 batteries so having three batteries total is a great plus. The title is very accurate this is an electric broom. Not meant for super heavy jobs, though I have blown leaves out of my flower beds. But if you need the sidewalks swept or the porch swept and you are tired of dragging out the broom, the black and decker is very light and works like a champ!"
5,LOVE THIS SWEEPER,"I got tired of sweeping and/or washing our large concrete patio, driveway and garage floor, so decided to try the B&D 18V battery powered sweeper. This thing works great!! I takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to do what used to take about an hour. Yes, the battery does wear down in 10-15 minutes, but so what, I just ordered an extra battery and now have plenty of juice to do it all. I hear others complain about battery life but can't rate that yet as the sweeper is only a month old. So far I love it!!"
4,Works for me,For my purposes the blower is adequate. It is lightweight and easy to use. It may not be as powerful as others would need. I chose it because I have other B&D 18v tools so I have several batteries I can use for continuous use. One battery doesn't last long enough for one job.
5,Good Product,"IF you a small area this little machine works very well.No need for gas ready when you need it,Great little sealer."
5,handy to have,"I recently bought this blower to supplement my backpack blower, NOT as a substitute for it. It is very handy for a quick job of blowing a driveway, deck, etc. It shouldn't be expected to blow leaves on a 2 acre yard. It doesn't seem to be under-powered and the battery life is sufficient. If you understand the blower's parameters, you should be quite happy with it."
3,Toy feel and sound,"Good performance when using on hard surfaces such as; garage floor, deck. etc.. My disappointment is with the high unit vibration and associated sound.Possibly could lead to reliability issues in the future."
3,An okay product,Just doesn't have as much power as I'd like. It will clean dry grass off the driveway which is why I purchased it.
4,Convenient outdoor clean up,Anyone who hates extension cords or filling and starting of gas sweepers and doesn't have a huge yard should consider this product! It's super convenient and may not be as strong as gas sweepers but the work is done painlessly in a snap!!
4,Electric Broom Sweeps Clean,The B&D NS118 18-Volt Electric Broom nearly equals my gasoline blower in output. Smooth surfaces are blown clean very essily with this device. It's light weight and ease of use makes this a welcome addition to my outdoor arsenal.
3,"Not Bad, But Not Big League","If you're looking for light clean up, nothing heavy, then this is a good tool. Blowing down a driveway or a deck, generally light debris, this will work fine. But if you're trying to get leaves out of the grass, or push anything that might grap onto grass, this is just not enough to get you there. I trimmed a holly bush and the leaves, which are the ""grabbing"" kind, were in the grass around the bush. This just didn't do a good job of getting them up and out. I had to pull out my Touro plug in blower, which I don't like using because of the electrical cord. The reason I bought this unit was to give me portability with minimal noise and fuss, and there's just not enough power with the 18V model to do it. I'm getting not quite 15 mins of blow time, which is frustrating at times.Bottom line, this won't do a whole yard of any meaningful size, and it's not the unit you want for jobs that require power behind it."
4,Russ Bach,Love the portability. No cord to hassle with. I am going to buy a second one for my condo in Palm Desert.
3,Corless broom,I find that the charge runs out sooner that expected and then blowing power is reduced. Works great for small 10 minute jobs.
2,Handy but weak,"I've owned this for 3-4 years. It is a good, strong, blower, but only if you have recharged the battery recently. Otherwise, it poops out quickly. I've also got the drill that uses the same battery pack, and it is the best drill I've ever owned. One of the chargers went TU recently."
3,"Good, but not for long","I enjoyed using the cordless broom, but the batteries didn't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. They were supposed to be usable for 3 hours a piece. Very Disappointing!"
4,Great blower for value,"I recently bought this blower from Meijer. I was looking for a blower that was non-gas powered and portable. I've heard too many expensive stories about working on and replacing gas powered blowers. I was replacing a B&D; corded blower given to me used and it couldn't even blow my hair dry.The power on this blower surprised me the second I turned it on. It cleared more than I thought it would. Great for any light debris that needs to be moved.The battery use is somewhat short. I have a short driveway with a sidewalk and door walkway, and it was able to clear all this with no problem but then noticed it was losing power. I have no comment on the enclosed charger as it has done its job thus far.I highy recommend this blower for short light duty. It is very powerful, lightweight and good value."
2,Weak Batteries,"I had this blower for around 2 years. Initially, the batteries kept a charge pretty good, but after a few short months, the charge would only last around 10 minutes."
3,DaMink,"I liked my older one better which was a 12 volt battery, because you didn't have to remove the battery to charge it. You just plugged it in on the back of the blower and that was it. Sometimes I forget to remove the battery to charge it and it is not charged when I go to use it. Other than that it works just fine."
4,Worth it for the batteries alone,"I have another B&D; 18 V product, a tree pruner that only came with one battery. Amazon has a pretty good price on the battery at 32 bucks, but then I saw this unit which comes with 2 batteries and another charger for 6 bucks more than the cost of two batteries! So now I have two 18V tools and 3 batteries with 2 chargers so I'll never find myself running out of juice again! Great Deal!Oh the blower is not advertised as a leaf blower, so don't expect the power of of corded or gas unit. But as others have noted it works great on the deck and patio with low noise and no smell of a gas engine.2010 update - it appears that B&D; now includes only one battery with this unit. Perhaps they realized it was too good a deal or people were not buying the batteries alone. That's a shame because I would NOT buy this unit with only one battery. You need at least two to get any work done, run time is not great and of course worsens as the batteries age."
2,Underpowered,"I owned the predecesssor to this model which was a 12 volt rechargable which hung on the wall in its recharger. the plastic impeller came apart (bad plastic or design) and tried to buy the part. I couldn't do it so I bought this 18 volt cordless model. it has considerably less power than the 12 volt, which had a battery about twice the size of the 18.volt. I will grant it is a benefit that the 18 volt has a removable battery so I can change batteries when one runs down but even when the battery is fresh, it does not blow as hard as the old model. Only consider this machine if you have a small area to do and nothing very heavy to blow."
5,This is GREAT Cordless Broom NOT a Leaf Blower,"This is one of the best engineered products Black and Decker makes. It will sweep your porch or sidewalk with ease. I can do my porch sidewalk and front driveway in about 5 minutes. It would take twenty with a push broom.Leaf blowers generally blow to hard and the high velocity of the air coming out sends debris airborne. This fine product moves the debris without launching it everywhere. As far as being a leaf blower, it is not, but for the purpose it is intended, it cannot be beat. I highly recommend it. It fact it was the first product in their 18V system in which the same battery will work in many different items. I now have two of the drills, a hedge trimmer, a jig saw, a circular saw, and a sander.Black and Deckers Firestorm line of 18V tools share the same battery."
3,Cordless Broom,Great value for the selling price the only negative is how long the batteries last after a full charge. It appears after 15 minutes the battery is discharged thankfully a second one was included in the box.
5,Highly rated by everyone,Seems that the Tackacs and the Talich come in at the top of every critics recommendations for Beethoven string quartets.The main point of this review is to point out that this is the Talich Quartet and it is of No 15 and 16 of the quartets.The title is incorrect and incomplete
2,Mixed feelings,"Sigh. It pains me to have to do this, but this is not the definitive performance of Tchaikovsky's Sixth. Where the heck is my beloved Chicago brass! Solti and his Chicago players have had a rare off-day. Now the Romeo and Juliet recording is quite good, but I don't know if it's worth the price of the whole CD, although it could be if you've got money to burn (hard to pass up any good performance of the Chicago Symphony)."
1,C++ Programmer trying to learn OWL,This book is absolutely terrible. The source code does NOT compile and it generates all sorts of errors. I am looking for an OWL Book that has good source code to learn from. Save your 40 bucks and don't buy this heap of garbage!!!!!! AND when you contact the publisher they tell you that they pulled the title from production!!!!! Why do they keep selling it then?????!!!!!!!!
4,The Train Stopped Here,"Gustafson and Serpico have published two books on the depots of the ATSF in California. This is volume 1 and covers the Los Angeles Division which is the area from the Nevada border, through Barstow, to LA and San Diego. More than 330 photos, illustrations, and maps document depots, towers, and freight depots. Floor plans and elevation drawings are included for some depots. Modelers of various eras will find something here for them. Hardback, 232 pages."
2,Not worth your money.,Way too little information for such thick book!(but good info on sewing knitted piece though.. even though it's only on 2-3 pages of the book.)
2,Do not expect this to be your only knitting guide,"I tried to teach myself to knit using only this book- don't try it, it doesn't work. I ended up buying some cheap, simple books with big pictures to show me how to follow the instructions in the ""Complete"" guide. The previous reviewer who said that the authors sometimes omit crucial information is absolutely right-simply telling you to ""turn your work"" doesn't make much sense if you're a brand new knitter and you can barely cast on. This doesn't mean that this is a bad book by any means, but it definately does NOT live up to the purpose of Complete Idiots Guide series- you must have some previous experience or outside help to learn to knit."
2,Photograph problem,"There are no photographs of the projects in this book! It would be much easier, especially for beginners, to know what the hat they're knitting should look like when it's finished. There is a photograph of beautiful knitted mittens on the book cover, but the book doesn't contain any mitten patterns. Go figure. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,This book will make you feel like an idiot,"I got this book hoping that I could teach myself how to knit. However, the illustrations did not provide enough consistent information for this visual learner, and I found myself constantly stuck and had to ask around for help to finish the most basic steps. The book provides a decent overview on knitting basics (e.g., needles, gauge), but does not include enough information for completely idiotic knitters (like myself) to get ourselves out of a pile of knots. You can get the same amount of information in this book, with the same illustrations, on the Internet."
2,Incomplete Reference,"I bought this book early in my knitting career and find it to be occasionally helpful. It's good with some knitting basics, but the two patterns I tried really weren't that cool. I completed them and they look okay, but I'd never want to wear them. To expand my yarn obsession (I guess) I used the book to learn to crochet. Some of the diagrams were helpful, but in the end this book didn't help me get the hang of it at all. There are some interesting tip boxes, and some good background, but overall I bet there's a better ""basics"" book out there."
4,A book I can always fall back on...,"I am a self-taught knitter, and I must say, that when I am in a bind, I can always find help from this book. I also like that it has both knitting and crocheting. The tips inside are also very helpful. If you are just learning to knit, I must say this is a great reference for you!"
1,dissapointing,I bought this book to further my crochet skills. Most of the stitches I looked for had useless pictures or were not even listed. Also in the back of the book there are listed various knitting publications- but not ONE for crochet. The way the book is done it seems that the crochet was a tack on at the end with not a lot of thought. There are more than a couple knit projects in here but only one or two for crochet.
2,Ummm...HELP!,"Knitting and Crocheting are things I have always wanted to learn. So I picked up this book in hopes I could learn the techniques. I followed all the directions but never knew if I was doing the stitches right.(I haven't gotten past the knitting part) The illustration showed how to do everything, but it never shows the finished stitch. I'm still stuck on casting on cause I don't know whether or not I'm doing it right. I think if I could get past this I would enjoy this book more. Has great tips and what you need to begin. Just can't get over the fact that it never show the finished look of something."
1,Any other knitting book better than this one,"I was very disappointed in this book. No photos, few illustrations (and poor ones at that), and not a great bibliography. I would say that any leaflet you could get at a craft shop would be better, or print stuff from the 'net. Even better, go to the library and check out what's there.Don't waste your your money on this book. You'll be an idiot, that's for sure."
3,Tiring for extended use - no lock on,"This is a nice trimmer but it loses two stars from me because it can't be locked on, you must grip the switch at all times or it shuts off. This makes it tiring for any extended use as the switches are not very ergonomic and awkward to turn on again after it turns off because you had to change your hand position slightly. Of course you can defeat this with a sliding hose clamp or loop of string (just like you have to do on lawnmowers nowadays), but IMO not allowing a lock ""on"" is a stupid design ""feature"". Thank you, lawyers for crapping everything up."
2,All looks and no performance,"Twice now this machine has jammed on me while trying to trim a simple little 12"" inch high box hedge. Don't even think about trying to use it on a normal sized hedge. You also expend so much energy holding the power trigger on, which effort is responsible for you breaking out in a heavy sweat. Another design triumph of form over function.Look for someone else's product - there are a number out there whose design aims are simply that the product must be capable of doing a job of WORK.You get the picture - this is the most pathetic piece of yard equipment I have the misfortune to own."
1,"bad design, bad product","Allow me to get to the point- this product is poorly designed and it's performance matches the design. They seem to have geared this trimmer towards trying to protect people who would hurt themselves with a product that would actually do the job right. There are so many safety features that you could probably give this to pre-schoolers and let them go to town without any worries. Unfortunately, if you're actually looking to trim your hedges you will definitely be disappointed. Be prepared to make many passes to get a neat cut and have soar fingers from having to constantly hold down the lame safety feature to keep the blades going. Then be ready for certain features to quit working and make your job even more difficult. My advice- buy a Stihl- their products rock and are made to get the job done (unfortunately not available at Lowes or Home Depot). The hedge hog serves no useful purpose."
2,didnt last very long,"I trim 10 bushes twice a year. It worked great, but on year 5 the gears stripped out. It was not abused."
2,Bummer.,"I had high hopes for this movie and bought it for my sons 4th birthday because he is obsessed with horses. I'm also a fan of old school disney but this movie was lame! Boring and I'm sad I actually bought a new DVD instead of a cheaper used one. Oh well, probably won't get a lot of use. My son doesn't like it too much."
4,Not bad,"This is pretty good. Yes, the cable was too short and didn`t reach the socket, but doesn`t take a genius to find some 14G wire and simply extend it."
5,recommended,This is a nice little accent to the rear of our new Dodge Durango. My wife wanted something unique on the trailer hitch receiver. It mounted easily and the wiring harness simply plugged in.
1,Fraudulent Picture For Item,"Even though I should have paid more attention to the actual size listed, the picture shown in selling this product should be removed and replaced with a picture of an actual sample of the cologne."
2,Not so great,"I changed the faceplate of my PSP but I'm not very happy with it. First of all the quality is not anywhere near to the original plate. Secondly, the buttons does not work, I had to use the buttons from the original faceplate. More over the faceplate does not lock well on the PSP. It still has an opening on the side even after removing the faceplate and installing it all over again. If my son had not borken the original faceplate I would have returned it.Thanks"
1,PSP faceplate,"This item was not received as ordered. Silver was ordered but gold was received. This was for a friend's husband for Valentine's day so they ended up having to wait on this error, which didn't get any expedited treatment despite being the seller's error. In addition, when the replacement came it ended up being white, not silver, & one of the buttons sticks. At this point seeing as it wasn't for us in the first place I just let it drop. If it was for me I would have returned it and got a refund due to the incompetence of the seller. TWO THUMBS DOWN, in my opinion."
4,,The faceplate and buttons had a nice look to them. The assembly was rather easy with the exception of all the tiny screws you had to unscrew.
2,not what i expected,"The face plate looks cool,but its too much trouble to put on and the butons get stuck."
3,Good but...,"Part got here fast and it is the right one, better than I can say for the local parts shop but no gasket or clips for the sensors. Looks like they strip out all those little parts that are really important (probably to sell separately). The Motorcraft part usually comes with at least the gasket and the first and second one of these I ordered came with O rings, gasket and clips (for the sensors)."
5,Very pleasant music to listen to,I love the piano and violin combination. Both players have spirit and compassion emitting from their participation. It is just remarkably soothing music which moves me very much. I just love to listen to Rick Silanskas music accompanied by Robert Kerr's violin.
5,His music wraps you in pure blissful melodies.,His music has such pure notes that it makes you feel as if you're floating with his music. His musicians accompany him so perfectly that they compliment his piano as if one instrument is producing the most beautiful heavenly sounds ever heard. The rare opportunity to see him in concert was an experience I'll never forget.
3,Interesting but slow,"""The Earthquake Bird"" starts out well enough to hold you for a while, but as the book progresses it wears itself out. A huge mystery is set in the first few chapters in which a body has been found in Tokyo Bay, and our main character (Lucy) is undergoing questioning. Lucy goes through the entire book narrating much of her life in Japan and her friendship with the deceased. We are led to think this must have some sort of significance, and towards the end I was left waiting to see how this woman cracked. But the conclusion was very disapointing and I felt like I just read 100-some pages of nothing to do with the backbone of the story.If you have some time on your hands give it a read, but I don't think it will leave you wanting more."
4,Review of the secrets every network marketer must know,"This book is very timely for those of us who are new in networking. I found so much that is good for me to put into action. The book is easy to read and, for the most part, takes care of the questions I came up with, as I read the book. The only reason I give it four stars is because, as I was reading there were a few questions that I didn't have answers to until the end of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone in multi-level sales."
4,"Bravo for the orchestra and the sonics, but Kondrashin is too moderate","I can't quite join in the fervor for this middle-of-the-road recording of the New World, a work so overly familiar that only the most outstanding performances can hope to make a difference at this point. Among the great conductors who have left memorable impressions -- Talich, Bernstein, Reiner, Szell, Kertesz, and Fricsay -- the stimable Kiril Kondrashin is good but too dutiful and moderate. We don't get any authentic Czech falvor or extra brio' the solo work doesn't glow. Even so, Decca has done a very good job with the soound (better by far thhan what they achieved for Kertesz in the Sixties), and the Vienna Phil, though not excited, plays with golden elegance.In all, a nice recording, but David Hurwitz'a blithe assertion that it sets the standard is ridiculous -- in forty years of record collecting, I don't recall anyone recommending Kondrashin over the classic versions mentioned above."
5,A great New World Symphony.,"The Kirill Kondrashin/Vienna Philharmonic Dvorak Ninth is one of the best you will find available. I grew up with the Bernstein/NYPO recording on the Columbia label, and that's a great performance too. The remastering that's been done with the Bernstein/NYPO recording, however, does not make it sound even remotely as good as the Kondrashin recording. It may have been nearly thirty years since Decca made this recording, but it still sounds great today and it's a better combination of performance and recording technology than you will find anywhere else."
1,Offensive to True Christians,"This book is an imitation of Souljah's ""Coldest Winter Ever."" The author has highly offended me by blasphemying the name of Jesus Christ by putting Him in the same category as a ""pimp."" It's written in narratives with little dialogue. ""Whoa unto those who bring offenses."" If Monique Morris didn't blasphemy, I would've given this a higher rating."
3,A Good Read,"This book was an interesting read. The voice of reason reminded me of Sistah Souljah's voice in Coldest Winter Ever. However, I saw the author on a panel of C-SPAN Booknotes and was disappointed with her performance. She didn't appear to be articulate or languistic. She constantly drank from her water bottle. Her eyes protruded around the room as if she held a grudge against everyone in the room. Maybe she was upset because she was the only black panelist and only female panelist. Maybe she was nervous. I was hoping to hear her talk about her book, but she didn't much. I don't mean to sound cruel, but she really didn't represent. It leaves me to wonder her validity of authorship."
5,Inspiration,"I havent read this book but i am very interested.If you have read the book and enjoyed it then i urge you to listen to the song ""Me & Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night"" by The Coup,from the album ""Steal This Album"".Its a hip-hop/rap song but The Coup is an Oakland based Political group.Boots Riley (The Coup) wrote and performed the song and if your wondering what this has to do with the book,this is the song that inspired the book.Even if you dont like rap you will like this song.You'll also see where Morris got the title ""Too Beautiful For Words""."
4,More than I expected,"I thought this would be a grim little story about street life but it is so much more. Yes, parts of it are extremely ugly. This a about a pimp, a hooker and their son after all but ultimaltely it's about hope and the human spirit. I know this will sound trite but Ms. Morris's fiction really is too beautiful for words.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men."
5,The coolest!!!!,"This is a great book containing the story about two sisters, twins, who are throwing a Christmas party, hosted by the two great twins. But when Elizabeth leaks her ideas to their parents and they decide to do the party Elizabeths way and not Jessica's. Then she wishes that it never happened. Duh!the days happen all over again. In my openion, it is a very sexy and nice book."
5,The Wizard of oz,"If you like adventure,suspense and heart warming stories this book is just right for you.It is a classic written by L. Frank Baulm. If you haven't heard of the Wizard of oz I am sure your first encounters you will think you are in the book and you wont stop reading it until you are finished."
3,Small black & white architectural monograph from Gustavo Gili,"ISBN: 8425216842 (Alison + Peter Smithson) ONLY is an exclusively black & white, concise, and copiously illustrated paperback survey published by Gustavo Gili (GG) of Barcelona in English and Spanish (side by side). A short introductory part on several pages is followed by the main review part presenting each shortly described project on excellent B&W photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line presentation drawings, sketches, etc. At the end, there are several pages with additional information incl. biography. Most of hundreds of only B&W illustrations are technical, but all (incl. B&W photos) are of a good quality, well balanced, crisp and legible. Like all from the Works and Projects series, it is solid among architectural monographs, but slightly smaller than the Studio Paperback series published by Birkhäuser Verlag under ISBN: 37643* (Basel)/08176* (Boston) or Artemis Verlag under ISBN: 37608* (Zürich)/18740* (London)."
2,Hardcore Frustration,"Hardcore Pinball gets 4 stars for a catchy sound track. Having to renavigate through the main game menu everytime you end a game is frustrating. The options were sparse. The ball physics are hard to learn as well.I recommend, Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire"
2,Timex Heart Rate Monitor,"The product was a nice, compact size but was too difficult to program. It was so ""un-user friendly"" that I returned it."
1,doesn't work to specs,I had to hold the watch next to the sensor for it to pick up heart rate. changed batteries with no change. both batteries i used tested good with battery checker.
2,Data send failed on day 5 of use/Warranty a bummer,"Seemed to be fine at the get go, but after 5 days of use...work out each day...it lost the ability to send or receive data. A real pain to work through the details of returning for warranty. Needed to send it Register/insured/Return Receipt and also send a $8 check with it to Timex repair in Arkansas..proof of purchase/ warranty slip filled out etc.. 30 days after mailing, I still don't have it back. Bummer. leeper"
2,only lasted for a few months,"It was an overall good heart rate monitor for a few months but now is not working properly. I'll be working out and then it will stop reading my heart rate correctly. Very frustrating when you are aiming to find your average heart rate for a workout, and then it stops working."
3,HRM,It really helps me to improve my workouts. I notice when I am slacking and when I'm on track. I used it for P90X. It is everything that I was looking for in a HR monitor.
4,Excellent product for the price,"I love this heart rate monitor. The band is rubbery so it is comfortable. As far as I can tell the monitor is accurate. I am very pleased with this product. I do wish it were a little simpler to set and that the chest band were easier to attach, but other than that, this personal heart rate monitor is great!"
2,Chest strap does not transmit information well!,"You get what you pay for. I tried to save a little by purchasing this one over another Polar brand one which I had previously owned. I used this only a few times and the chest strap would not pick up my heart rate. It was inaccurate so the watch would calculate incorrect statistics and calorie burn. It would freeze and stop calculating in the first 10 minutes of my cardio workout. I called the company, and after a couple weeks I received a new chest strap. It hasn't frozen yet, but it is not accurate in its readings. I should have bought a Polar, which I never had any problems with as far as chest strap accuracy and transmitting information to the watch."
4,Works great,"This watch works just like it says...a little hard to set up, but once you get it set up everything works fine. Would recommend for first time purchase of heart monitor."
3,All functions dont work,The watch is ok but supplied manuals are worthless. There is no instruction on activating certain functions and no combination of button pressing allows me to determine max heart rate or other such measures. I wonder if my unit is faulty but have resigned to use it a basic monitor of heart rate.
5,satisfied,"My first BP watch; I've used it several times right now and it works great. For the most part I like to use it to see how many calories I've burned during: RPM class, jogging, each time pushing myself into Max heart rate then checking my recovery time. It does not accumulate your workout time\burned cals etc. It only shows the last workout data."
4,Not just for uber jocks!,"This is comfortable to wear and seems to be pretty accurate. It's not as intuitive as I had hoped and may require pushing several buttons to get the information while working out, which can be tricky. Still, the range of info (heart rate, avg heart rate and length of time in target zone) is very helpful and I've noticed a difference in my workouts. I can set goals and get closer to meeting them using the information. It's also fun to see what else my heart is up do during yard work, etc. As noted by another reviewer, the chest strap has a potentially fragile clasp but so far, so good. I think this is a great value for the money for anyone who is interested in learning more about what kind of work their heart is doing-"
4,Just what I was looking for,This is just what I need to monitor my heart rate during exercise. It has an alarm that notifies me when I am over my target heart rate so that I can adjust my intensity. The dial is large enough for my 'old' eyes to see. I didn't need any fancy bells and whistles so this is the perfect heart monitor.
3,Mehhhh,"Sometimes it doesn't pick up the signal from the chest strap, usually this happens when my skin or the strap is cold. It's not very reliable."
5,amazing!!,"i love it, i have seizures so it will alert when i have a seizure, i sooo needed this watch"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This was the worst purchase ever!!!! I buy a lot of stuff, even junk that i know that I wouldnt even really need but it looks cool.. but this is the WORST!!!! it would turn off on its own, it was so inaccurate, it says my heart beat was 133 bpm sitting down driving.... i even correlated it with an actual heart rate monitor from my work at the hospital, and also used a pulse oximeter and the watch and chest strap was SO OFF!! and i went to go for a jog and 10 mins in the jog it says i burned 400 + calories. it was so off."
2,Disappointed,"Started using this product a couple of days after receiving it. It worked fine for the first few times of use. After that, while working out at the gym, the watch would lose contact with the sending unit once in a while. The last straw was when I had been working out for almost 1 hour and was on the treadmill and the watch told me my heart rate was only 65! It should have been up around 130 to 140. Then the watch would go blank lines which told me that it was, again, losing contact with the unit. When it did this 3 to 4 times in 5 minutes, I decided that it had to go back.Very disappointed in this product."
4,Heart Rate Monitor that meets my need,"I've had this monitor for about 3 weeks and have used it many times on long bike rides. The heart rate monitor is simple to use and works.It may not have all the ""bells and whistles"" that more expensive monitors have but it WORKS. I was looking for a device that would capture my heart rate during long, intensive bike rides and this monitor does this consistently. The monitor is unisex and the size is little smaller then I'm used to but it WORKS.As mentioned with other reviews, the extra latch on the heart rate monitor and chest strap are a little excessive but hey it all WORKS."
4,Nice,"Product works as advertised. Instructions are a bit confusing.These 71 year old ears cannot hear the alarm sounds but all in all, I'm happy with the item."
5,Works great,I bought this for my wife. She loves it. It tells her all the things she wants to know when she works out.
1,Tried to Cancel Order within 2 hours-- REFUSED to cancel,I ordered this Timex as a gift for my sister who lives in California. I live in Pennsylvania. This watch looks exactly like the one that counts calories that my husband has. BUT I reread the description and it DOES NOT COUNT CALORIES like his does. When I realized this I tried to cancel the order within two hours and though the watch is not being shipped right away I couldn't cancel the order!! Now my sister has to receive something she has to reship back or refuse......this really sucks!!!!!!!
1,Totally Useless,"The only thing I can get this to do is BPM. Two trainers and I have looked at it, but can't figure out anything else. (All three of us are college graduates.) Directions are horrible. Don't waste your money. Nobody at my gym has EVER had one that worked beyond giving BPM. Just a piece of junk. If you must find this out on your own, be sure to save the package so you can return for a full return."
3,battery died right away,"Works well for the price and what it is. I bought it to track my heart rate and calories burned during spin class. It worked fine for about 2 weeks, then the battery died. a cheap, easy fix, but a pain nonetheless. The one I purchased for my dad arrived with a dead battery. The price is right though and it does what it's supposed to when the battery is charged."
1,doesnt work correctly,I figured I would give it a try even though my sister in law said that she tried this and it did not work properly.The calories burned are over exagerated. A good thing if you want to kid yourself and pretend you are burning more than you really are but not reality. I am going to try another brand.
2,Don't use in SNAP Gyms,"This monitor does fine for walking around the neighborhood and working out at home...but not in the gym around others who are wearing other brand monitors...I use SNAP GYM and whenever a trainer is working with a client, the client's sending unit screws up this Timex unit's reading on the SNAP Gym Cybex machine I'm using at the time...the result is frustration...I don't like wearing a unit that can't be trusted because it is over powered by other brand units being worn by others working out in the area... I asked the trainers what sender they're using and they all use Polar because it sends out a much stronger signal and won't be compromised by other senders in the area...this Timex is just too weak to compete with other heart rate transmitters to be used in a gym environment... I gave mine to my teen daughter to use with her Wii workout program and bought a Polar for serious use in a gym environment."
1,Difficult to set up,"Instructions are not intuitive and the device is difficult to set up, I would not recommend this product to any one who did not have a lot of time on their hands"
4,Beware of Heart Zones,"The watch is great. Definitely does the job.But beware of Heart Zones (the included booklet). As far as I can tell from their web site they're a grasping money making outfit, presenting themselves as the only source of true and correct information. For determining your correct heart rate, instead of relying on the dubious Heart Zones method, you should do a web search and you'll find more even handed information out there."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this item to replace a Nike heart rate monitor. I don't like the Timex much because it's less solid than my previous watch (plastic feel) and has a lot less flexibility/fewer functions. It does estimate how many calories you've burned. If that's all your after, it could be a good choice.Look back, I can add that the chest strap did not last very long. NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,Calorie counter,It took a little while to figure out how to work it. I'm disappointed that I can't wear it all day and keep track of my calories burned. It looks like I can only do that during exercise. So I am going to send it back and keep looking for the right watch.
2,Buyer be Aware!,"After thoroughly researching this Timex heart rate monitor I concluded that since it was analogue technology the transmitter (chest strap) would communicate to my major name brand treadmill. It did not! I have tried several analogue heart rate monitors and they have all successfully transmitted a decipherable signal to my treadmill. Not so with this Timex watch. Secondly, I thought the watch had a ""timer"" on it. I enjoy timing my stretches and other things before and after my workout. This watch does not have a dedicated timer. I returned this product."
1,Piece of Junk - Don't Waste Your Time or Money - Minus 5 Stars!,"This Timex Heart Rate Monitor gives erratic heart rate readings. One minute it would say my heart rate was 43 beats per minute, then it would jump up to 190+ beats per minute... even though I was working out at a steady pace. I spent countless hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. I replaced the battery. I returned it to Timex for repairs twice. The S&H costs alone for the repairs are a big % of what I spent on the watch in the first place. It still doesn't work. Lots of time and money down the drain. Then I borrowed a different HRM. It works like a charm every time. Turns out I wasn't doing anything wrong besides buying a piece of junk. Timex USED TO BE a respected brand name and make good products. Live and learn. I've put the heart rate monitor model that I borrowed on my list for Santa. This one can't be trusted."
4,Good heart rate watch,"Good basic heart rate monitor. Comfortable, and keeps basic stats on your last workout. They only complaint I have it that the chest strap constantly beeps when it's on. If there's a little bit of noise around it gets drowned out, but if it's quiet it's pretty annoying."
4,great hr watch overall,"Overall very pleased. Only used it a few times. But there are distinct pluses and minuses with this watch already.(+)VERY easy to see the HR. You literally push a button on the face of the watch and the watch does the rest. No complicated setup.VERY simple to setup and use. The manual made sense, also.I like that it saves the last set of stats (high hr, avg hr, time, etc.)(-)The overall quality and feel of 1) the watch band and 2) the connection of the body strap. The watch band is confortable, a soft rubbery/plasticy band that conforms nicely around the wrist. Not sure how long it will last. But the body strap... where it connects- its a cheap plasticy/rubbery thing and there are very small parts to it that seem like they could easily break literally any time. Hoping that will last... as if it doesn't... the watch is useless without the strap!I would have rated a ""5"" if it weren't for the connection on the strap looking like it could break!"
1,Do Not Buy if you are looking for accurate calorie counting!,"I bought this product for a friend, and I was very disappointed in the product. I bought it because it was a top rated heart rate monitor on Consumer Reports. The calorie count is my favorite part of my heart rate monitor. My friend & I worked out togther and her Timex said she had burned 4x as many calories as my heart rate monitor reported. I wish I could burn almost 900 calories in a 45 minute easy jog/walk. If you want a reliable calorie count, do not buy this watch!"
2,"Watch still working, chest strap unit died quickly","Started out using this quite a bit but before long I started having trouble with it not communicating with the watch. Put a new battery in the chest strap and it seemed to help for awhile but pretty soon it was not working consistently again, threw it in a drawer. Ran across it again and put another battery in to see if it would by chance work but no such luck, dead. I mostly take walks so don't work out at all intensely so this unit really didn't see any tough usage. Lasted about two months reliably. Save your money and try something else."
5,Low Cost but Accurate,"Two things why I will recommend this product:1. Low Cost2. AccurateCompared this product to the heart rate monitor reading of Precor Elliptical I used in Hilton Hotel in San Francisco USA. The reading from the Precor Elliptical is the same reading I got from Timex T5G971. One advantage of Timex over Precor is that it's much more synchronize from the heart's beat reading. I already bought two of these. I used one for my elliptical machine while the other for my spinning bike.After the training (Cardio Routine), timex will provide all the necessary measurements you need such as calories burn, zone time, cardio time, min and max heart rate."
4,"Solid, basic HRM","I've been using this for 3 weeks and I'm very satisfied. I used a Polar for approximately two years because everyone says they are the best. In terms of actual operation, I find that this Timex drops the signal on a much less frequent basis than my $130 Polar. When the battery died on the Polar I decided against spending $85 sending it back to Polar for a replacement (what the heck are they thinking?). I bought this Timex on sale for $40 and it's a solid little HRM. No bells and whistles and that suits me just fine."
4,ALL AROUND 5 STARS,"This heart rate monitor tells the time and date, is a stopwatch, a one-minute recovery function, counts your calories burned during a workout and has alarms to keep you in the Heart Rate Zone you want to be in (fat burning / cardio / etc). The strap fits comfortably and transmits a signal constantly to the watch unit. I have worn it 3 days in a row with no problems. If something happens to the strap or it stops working, I'll be sure to edit my review, but for now - the price is right and the product is solid.It does not have GPS.It is important to read the instructions to understand all of the functions of the watch.CONS:Does not work while swimming - it kept trying to tell me that my HR was 38 after 4 laps at the pool. Hmmmmm..."
1,calorie count Is too high,This is a good basic HRM but the calorie count is way off rendering it useless for me. The strap was at least comfortable.
4,Great Gift for the Runner in your Family,I gave this gift to my father this past Christmas and he really enjoyed it. It seems very easy to use.
1,Terrible.,"The strap broke 5 months after purchase, past Amazon's garbage one month return policy. The strap isn't covered under Timex's warranty so now I'm stuck with a completely useless hunk of plastic.Avoid this product at all costs."
1,Stopped working within a year,"Item worked great for about a year, then it just stopped being able to pick up on my heart rate. Before it would pick it up after 2 tries... then 6... then eventually stopped picking up at all. this was even after replacing the battery and wetting the strap, per instructions. Not worth it. Pay the price for a better one and keep it longer... longer than a year! I just trashed mine today."
4,Great watch even in sweaty workouts,"I love this watch! I wanted a watch with a pretty accurate calorie counter and this is it! The chest strap gives a true heart rate and you plug in your weight to get a better caloric burn result. I teach Zumba Fitness so I sweat a lot and dance all over the place. I can't even tell I have the chest strap on. At first it wasn't registering my calories, then I read the manual and realized you need to wet the sensor pads on the back of the chest strap first. Since then I've had no problems. I love it! Wish I could find this in women's with other colors!"
1,Hate it.,I like the look of this watch but that's about it. My biggest problem is that the start/stop workout button is on top of the watch face. If I'm wearing a tighter fitting running jacket and gloves the pressure from them turns off my workout so I lose all of my data. It also doesn't have a stopwatch (up or down counting) which I was almost positive I saw in the watch description when I purchased it.
5,great for it's price!,It takes a couple of times to get used to getting a reading from the chest strap to the watch. Remember to moisten the strap sensor like the directions say. Your sweat then keeps the moisture so that the sensor can grab your heart rate........
4,Would be a 5 if it had a Pedometer & Better strap closure,"Fortunately I read prior reviews and knew about the hook problem on the strap. I can see how it could rip easily if you are not careful when putting on the strap. It is comfortable, except when driving to the gym. I just wish the watch had a pedometer feature so I could keep track of my steps throughout the day, but for this price point I am happy with the product. Being a first time buyer, this is the right monitor. Easy to use, no programming necessary."
1,HORRIBLE,"I purchased this in June, it's October and the shiznit does NOT work. It consistently tracks my heart rate as if I am a snail - 59 bpm while doing kickboxing at HOME, with NO interference. Really!?! I won't be purchasing another TIMEX period!"
4,"Just got it in, can't wait to try it out","I'm new to using heart rate monitors, but when I read the previous reviews on this, along with the price, I figured I'd give it a try. Straight out of the box, I saw the strap I had to wear on my chest...I didn't realize that...but I'll deal with it.Looking through the instructions, they are really point blank, in some respects. I had to get online to figure out some things, but for the most part it was easy enough. I'm not too sure on how long it will last, it SEEMS like it should last a while, but who knows. I don't really like the screen, but I'll have to adjust as time goes on.I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 right now, since so far it does what it says it will do. I'll post in a week or so after using daily to add to or take away anything."
1,Never worked.,"I received my heart rate monitor yesterday and spent some time trying to get it to work, including replacing the battery in the chest strap. Nothing helped. I simply doesn't work."
3,Timex T5G971,"It's a bit difficult to get the pulse and heart rate monitoring to start, also I wasn't aware that I had to wear the chest band in order to get the pulse. That wasn't mentioned in the ad. So I can't just wear it as a watch, and then push a button whenever I feel like it and check my pulse. As well, it's session oriented, you start a session of monitoring, and when you start another, the entire history is overwritten."
2,Needed help with initial set-up,"Like everything except the instructions never told how to enter my weight for an accurate calorie reading - does anyone know? Otherwise, seems to be a good product."
1,heart rate monitor wrist watch,i ordered this to monitor my heart rate and did not know you had to strap a sensor around your chest. tried using it but readings were so erratic i returned it for a refund. I was actually looking for a replacement type i had in the past that monitored your pulse on the wrist and also kept time.
4,A good product,I've owned the watch and monitor for several weeks and have been very satisfied with it.
2,Works well for a month or two,I bought two of these heart rate monitors in early June. One only worked for a month before the receiver wouldn't receive any signal. The other still works when I'm at rest but it's routinely off by 20-40 beats/minute during workouts.For the price of two I could have bought one that might still be working. Is it really worth buying any product if it's going to stop working?
3,Not as durable as expected for Timex...,"Hubby is a runner so I surprised him with this several weeks back. He had a secondhand one he'd bought off a colleague that worked great, so we thought this would be even better... but it only works when it feels like it or something, occasionally it won't sync or give any kind of reading during the run. If he's standing still in the kitchen it works great, but if he's pounding the pavement - nothing. Maybe we missed something, but it doesn't seem to do the job all the time. When it does, it rocks, but it's lacking in operational consistency."
2,Calorie counter is inaccurate,"I purchased this product around four weeks ago. The instructions on its use were a little convoluted but I managed to figure them out. The heart rate monitor and alarms work fine, but the calorie counter is miscalibrated. I noticed this when I tracked average calorie count for activities at my weight vs that reported on the watch. I then compared the monitor watch with a monitor on my treadmill. Rate and time were spot on, calorie count was far too high. I called Timex and they were very nice and promply sent me an exchange watch which they said that they had tested...it did the same thing.I lost faith in trying for another return and recalibrated the watch myself by inputing my weight minus 60 lbs. I came up with that approximation by trial and error. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product.Signed,Nolan Jones"
1,Watch froze during HR monitoring,"I purchased this watch on Amazon. I was used but ""new condition"". I should have know better... It froze while monitoring heart rate. It happened repeatedly. I contacted Timex support and they told me how to perform a hard reset on this watch (press and hold all buttons at the same time). Performing the hard reset did ""unfreeze"" the watch without me having to remove the batteries to do it, but Timex said it needed to be sent back to the factory for repair. I've used Garmin watches for running for years with no problems. It's too bad. This experience will probably make me stay away from Timex in the future. Of course, as I mentioned, the watch was in used condition, so my guess is it was a return that someone picked up, changed batteries, and resold without really knowing what the problem was. However, it still was a lemon for me."
1,Didn't work for me.,"Despite many reviews touting how well this heart rate monitor functions, I could not get it to work for me. The first time I tried it, the monitor was able to find my heart rate but it was far lower than what was possible. After that, I was never able to make a connection between the chest strap and the watch despite trying multiple positions and re-wetting it constantly. When looking for troubleshooting help,I found the directions to be poorly written and unhelpful. I certainly cannot recommend this product. It is the first product that I have ever had to return."
1,Expensive Watch,"Can't tell you if this thing works because the battery is either dead or the product is broken. Before I return it, I plan to purchase a battery for the sensor to see if that addresses the problem. Not happy at all that the battery might be dead, but then again, it was listed as ""USED"", so I guess it's my fault. FAIL."
2,Good but didn't last long....,"I bought this and after using it about three times a week for 6 months- the watch will not connect with the heart strap. I have tried new battery, after new battery- and still no connection. When it works, it does work well. Just disappointed that it didn't last long!"
5,Much better than my more expensive Polar F4!,"For the price and what I wanted in a hr monitor, I am beyond pleased with this product. I had a Polar F4 that was nothing but trouble. It never read my heart rate properly and a half hour of INTENSE (85% max heart rate) cardio would give me a calorie burn reading of about 115 calories. The Timex is far more comfortable to wear. The chest strap stays in place. It's consistent, it doesn't just stop reading my heart rate for no reason. Easy to program, easy to read the results, and perfect for what I wanted - a heart rate monitor that told me how many calories I burned! Also the watch band is very soft, comfortable, and stays closed. If you want something simple (no bells and whistles) and reliable, without breaking the budget, this is the right product!"
4,just right,bought this to replace a Polar HRM and it worked as advertised. Keeps track on how long you've stayed on your target heart rate and estimated calories burned on the display is a nice plus.
2,Disapointment,"I relied on Customer's Report in chosing a Heart rate Monitor. The Timex T5G71 Unisex Sports Personal Heart Rate Monitor Watch was rated the highest and for that reason I purchased it. I was most disapointed with its performance. It took several minutes to start and when it did, my heart rate was all over the place. It never came near the heart rate shown on some of the workout machines at the fitness cetre. The chest strap fasteners were also found to be very flimsy and I could see it breaking down after a short period of time. For these resons I return my purchase."
4,Correction,"I'm using this Timex HR monitor for P90X (Plyometrics and Kempo). When it works, it works well. The problem is that it will often not read my heart rate until I am several minutes into the exercise. I tried adding water, making the strap tighter, and changing the batteries,but no improvement. Maybe I got a dud? If it continues to be unreliable I think I'll check out another brand. The watch also looks cheap, but I would be OK with that if only it worked better!CORRECTION:After purchasing another (more expensive) HR monitor, I now realize that the electrodes on the strap are in the side pieces and NOT in the center piece. I had been wetting the center piece. If I wet the side pieces it reads my heart rate immediately. Duh... I checked out the instruction manual, it does not show you where the electrodes are located. Anyways, I upgraded my rating to 4/5."
4,nice product,"Timex seems like an old time company but this product shows how they are really up with the times these days. This will give you a nice baseline to start to measure progress and changes by, but keep in mind that thier can be a lag and it is not necessarily real time reporting. Works wonderfully to give you a resting heart rate but is VERY sensitive to your body's movement and readings will jump all over the place.Considering, what you pay for this, I think it is a good value and very reasonably priced. I would recommend it to anyone who works out and just wants to keep it more interesting while exercising."
4,Good Product,"This product does what it needs to do.... good functions for price... gives you average heart rate during workout, max heart rate during workout, time you worked out, and some other functions. Good product for price... The only cons I would say are that sometimes the monitor acts funny and doesnt read the heart rate correctly, but does not do it often. Overall I would give this product a 7.5/10. A good basic heart rate monitor."
3,Good HRM but calories burned innacurate for women,This HRM is pretty easy to set up and use and the watch and band are comfortable. As far as I can tell the heart rates are accurate but it doesn't ask if you are male or female and the calorie burn is WAY higher than it should be - the default must be for male. It's annoying but you can take the HRM values and plug them in to a calorie burn equation that asks for M/F to get a more accurate number.
1,Heart monitor did not work,"The battery in the chest strap was dead, so I bought a new one ($5!), but it was still inoperative. I wet the monitor and my chest, but no signal was detected. I'm returning it."
4,Great for the price nice looking and work as well and my other more expense Times,Good. Work just like my other Times I think It was an Iron Man or something to that effect. Had it for 8 year before it gave it up. This one was a bit cheaper and easier to work with.....we will see if i last as long.
1,This trainer has never worked for me.,"I would never buy another Timex again, let alone a trainer. The monitor is sporadic at best. The chest strap is cheap. Total waste."
1,"doesn't work at all...... I am very disappointed, and you can't return for free either.","this watch doesn't work at all. It is also extremely confusion to work. I am very disappointed, and you can't return for free either."
1,Look else where,So the reviews I read where hit and miss on this Item. I only bought it because timex is usually a good brand and this was in my price range at the time. I've only been using this item for a few months and now it doens't work. the on/off button stopped turning it off then it quite working all together. What I can tell from the warrenty information this won't be covered because I'm sure they will say it was from wear and tear on the thing. Honestly it should have lasted longer.
2,Lasted only 6 months,"I bought this HRM to replace a New Balance model that I had for over 2 Years. The band had broke. When I got the Timex one it was easy to set up and I liked the features very much. Tracking my workouts was easy and I really liked it better than the previous one however, this week it stopped working. It will not pick up the heart rate. The watch works and all the other features work. I replaced the battery in the strap twice just to be sure it wasn't the battery and it's still not working. I plan to send it in under the warranty but have to pay $7 fee plus shipping and it will take 4-6 weeks. Really annoying after just leass than 6 months of use. I will have to be without one to track my workouts till it comes back. This is the biggest inconvinenece even more than expense. If you are looking for a HRM I would pass on this one."
4,works well,"I checked out Consumer Reports [...] to see their choice for best heart rate monitor & have been very happy with it. My Garmin with a heart rate monitor was always going in & out & never consistently showed my heart rate, so I wanted a quality monitor. I've had it a month & used it a lot & have been very happy with it."
4,Good product & great guy!,This product was as good as it was advertised. I am sure it works as advertised however it would not function properly for me. The reason is I have an implanted pacemaker and the two are not compatible because of the transmitters operating frequency. The HR Monitor's transmitter seemed to be interfered with by the pacemaker. The HR Monitor DID NOT interfere with the pacemaker. I tried three different ones and two other makes with the same results. I recommend this product to anyone without a pacemaker.
3,Works for me,"When I first got it, I had the same problem others have reported with this heart monitor (and others) - difficulty establishing and maintaining the signal from the chest strap to the wristwatch. I've gotten it working fine now, though. The trick is twofold - first, you do need to moisten the sensors on the chest strap (Amazon also sells a gel for that purpose but water works for me) and second, the chest strap has to be tighter than you might think. If you're having a problem maintaining a steady signal, cinch the strap a little tighter. Worked for me and I'm now happy with the purchase."
2,An HRM with usless extras,"Pros:+Cost+Accurate heart beat monitor+Works with Polar enabled Gym Equipment+User replaceable batteries+The transmitter has a low volume beep with your heart to let you know its working.Cons:-Cheaply made (other Timex watches @ $25 dollars don't feel as cheap as this one) (- 1/2 star)-Calorie Counter is not accurate and manuals don't provide the formula used by the watch so you can't adjust the watch's estimate for your personal situation.Had they published the formula, then this wouldn't be such a big deal. The watch doesn't adjust for gender (it's not an input), it is way off but itseems to adjust for weight which you supply (-2 star).-Poor documentation with watch and none on Timex web site. (- 1/2 star)Recommand?No. If you just need a heart monitor, get the T5G941, Omron 100 or Polar FS1. If you want calorie monitoring get a Polar F6, F7, FT7 or FT40. The FT series Polar watches now allow end users to replace batteries on the watch and heart monitor."
4,How to set the HRM parameters,"This is a very nice unit, but the manual completely skips instructions on setting the HRM parameters. Through trial & error, I figured it out.1. Set the time and date as instructed on page 15 - 19 of the Timex booklet.2. Set the HRM parameters (Target zone limits, etc) shown on page 8 - 9 of the Timex booklet.a. Be sure the HRM is off (time is displayed)b. Turn HRM on by pressing `on/off' button (3 dashes will display)c. Get into change mode by pressing and holding the `set' button. The 1st digit of the Lower Target Zone Limit group will start flashing.d. Press the `on/off' button to change the flashing digit.e. Press the `Recall' button to move to the next digit.f. Repeat steps d and e until all digits are set. After the last digit in a group is set, pushing the Recall button will take you to the next group.g. After all parameters are set, press the `Set' button to exit the change mode.h. Press and hold the `on/off' button to turn off the HRM. (time will display)."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this HRM about three weeks ago and have been very disappointed with the performance. The signal from the monitor to the watch has been inconsistent at best. About half of the time, I can't get the watch to detect the band, despite using water, etc. Additionally, I've seen technical difficulties on numerous occasions already (obviously not reading correctly). The HRM also grossly overestimates the number of calories burned (one of the main reasons I even bought an HRM). Save your money and put it towards a higher quality product."
3,Looses Signal,"so overall, I think this is an ok watch. It does loose signal during a kickboxing class that I take. Which is frustrating, it just shuts off. The calorie count that is calculates is also extremely high.I would NOT purchase this watch again. My old one was a Sigma, and I wish I stuck with the Sigma."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"My Polar HRM died after 2 years of heavy use. After reading a positive review in ""Consumer Reports"" magazine, I chose the Timex T5G971 for its functional simplicity and easy to read display. It does everything I want it to do; what it doesn't do is of little importance to me. I use it while riding my stationary bike where I keep my heart rate between 105 and 130. Even more importantly, I use it when playing tennis (singles) to ensure my heart rate stays within a healthy range. If my heart rate rises above 158, I need to let my BPM drop back to 130 or below; another reason I like the large display. I had read in other reviews, that the manual was unclear. No so, I read it, and set the HRM up in 5 minutes. Of lesser importance, it has some style to it. I would recommend this HRM without reservation."
4,Baby's first HRM,"I've recently started training for a triathlon set to take place in June and the training program is Zone based and I quickly went searching reviews and Consumer Reports for what would be a solid HRM without all the extra bells and whistles. Everything led me to the Timex T5G971.It's accurate. I don't have issues with it glitching or messing up once it's going. It's easy to use and there are not tons of settings. I set my minimum and maximum heart rate and set the alarm to sound when I go outside of those bounds. It works. It does everything I need it to.Definitely a great choice for those just getting into Zone training.My one complaint is about once a week I have a connectivity issue. It resolves itself a little faster each time the issue arises, but it is a bit frustrating to have to wait several minutes and repeatedly press the On/Off button because the monitor and the display aren't talking.Overall, 4 stars."
2,Disappointing,"In spite of this model being top-rated by a leading consumer magazine, I've had lots of trouble with this heart rate monitor being accurate or functioning correctly. I've changed batteries, changed positions, changed tightness of the chest band, etc. and sometimes it works and sometimes it is obviously inaccurate. I will likely send it back or seek a refund. Very disappointing."
2,Stop Working,"I replaced the battery in the monitor, but can't get a reading on the watch. It does work with the equipment at the gym. But I purchased this in October - in less than three months, it is not working properly."
1,Avoid the t5g981,"This product does not list the model number, but if this is the t5g981, then avoid it.The manual says you can input your weight, but there is no where to do that -- if you press the Set button, it cycles through things like the time, date, chime, etc. but never asks for weight.Weight is important for the calorie counter -- the calories burned are VERY inflated...This was a gift to me, but I would never buy it myself."
4,Bargain Heart Rate Monitor,"Wanted to monitor the intensity of my bike rides and did not want to spend $300-$400. This Timex heart rate monitor was $50 through Amazon and serves the purpose. Very easy to set up, easy to use. Fairly basic in output but exactly what I wanted. Not training for Tour de France just trying to find out how hard I am pushing the cardio system. The output is: Time of exercise session, time in the selected heart rate zone, average rate, peak rate, calories."
4,meets my expectations,"I've had this monitor for a month now and love it. It has worked very well for me and takes accurate readings. It suites my needs perfectly - alerts me when I reach my max target, and gives me good readings, fits well, and works without any glitches."
3,Basic and difficult to use,"This heart rate monitor is a pretty bare-bones model, but adequate for basic tasks. I echo what other reviewers have said about the difficulty of setting the watch and entering information. It's not even a little bit intuitive and the manual is, to be kind, worthless. It gets the job done, but only just."
1,Junk,Worked great for about 3 weeks then the chest strap stopped being reliable. It would work fine then just stop in the middle of a workout. Replaced the battery and it still did it. Would turn in for warrantee but would rather just try for something of quality.
4,Review for Timex T5G971,This is a great product for the price. It does exactly what it is supposed to do.
4,Timex T5G971,"This is an excellent basic monitor, good value and works well. I have used it for about a month in various settings and could not be more pleased. However, the user instructions remind me of such things written 20 years ago when techies whose third language is English tried to communicate ""how to."" It took me an hour of trial and error and finally a call to tech service to set it up. That should not deter purchase but Timex should make their user materials as up-to-date as their product design and packaging."
4,My Review,Overall it meets my expectations. Sometimes the heart rate reading spikes. Other times the body lead loses connection with the watch for a couple of minutes before re-connecting. For the most part it works fine.
5,Great HRM,For the price it is a great heart rate monitor. I had no problems with the batteries or anything else. The belt is easy to use and reads the heart rate accurately. It also works with my treadmill wirelessly. Great product.
4,Good for a beginner but poor directions,"This heart rate monitor/watch is a great way to track your heart rate through various exercises but is challenging to program. You are able to set target rates with an alarm when you hit them which is a nice feature. The chest strap also coordinates with the cardio equipment at my gym. Overall, I'd recommend this for its low price and multi-functionality but the directions need an overhaul."
1,Not really Unisex,"Well, I was hesitant about buying something that was Unisex and I was right. The sensor that goes around the torso doesn't fit me. I suppose I could tighten it till I can't breathe and then maybe it would read my heart rate but that isn't what I was looking for when I bought it. The sensor does work when I push it into position. If it were more flexible (the material the sensor is a part of) it might read my heart rate. So back this heart monitor will go. I will buy one specifically for women. For the record, I AM a thin person with a petite torso (although being pregnant my torso IS growing :) I didn't see a measurement that said if your torso around the sternum measures less than XX, this product is not for you. That would have been helpful."
5,Great watch and heart rate monitor,"I needed a watch plus I do some jogging so I decided to get this watch. This product is awesome, it is easy to use and very accurate. It took a few minutes to set up and learn the features but it is great."
1,Disappointed,I have had this product since early January and after just over 7 months the heart rate readings are completely inaccurate. This was not a great purchase unfortunately.
3,good when it can read my heartrate,"If I'm sweating a lot it usually works, but sometimes it just won't read anything. It could be because I'm pregnant, but it's definitely annoying!"
3,Timex T5G971 heart rate monitor watch,"This watch comes with a chest monitor that works fine, it stays in place and seems accurate. I would like the numbers on the watch to be thicker to be easier to read. I expected the watch to have some basic functions like stopwatch, countdown timer and split timer, functions most $5 watches have. The buttons to set the functions are confusing (that may just be me) and requires the manual to set things like heart rate limits. Overall good value for the money."
4,Good product for a fair price.,"This watch is simple but good. For the price I would say it is a good buy. The price is similar to a simple model from polar, but the TIMEX comes with the stripe that is an extra US$ 40 if you buy the polar. I am just missing a chronometer. Other than that, I am satisfied with the product."
3,"Average, but not great","This was my first heart rate monitor. I bought it so I could make sure I was staying within my target zone during my workouts and to keep track of how many calories I was burning. My biggest gripe about this HR monitor is that it has a hard time keeping an accurate HR if you have a shirt on. Also, unless the watch is VERY close to the transmitter, it can be off quite a bit. I bought some electrode spray hoping that would help it to keep a more accurate reading, but it didn't help much. Also, it WAY overshoots on calories burned. I bought a Polar after I returned this and it gives a much more accurate HR reading and calorie count."
5,"Had to get used to it, but now I love it.","The wife took over my old Ironman HRM, with which I was very familiar. So, I got this one. It's simpler. Only one zone, although I rarely ever used more than one anyway. Love how the zone alarm turns on and off with one press of a button. Great performance, especially for the money. It's a good!"
3,Good Heart Rate Monitor,"I bought this monitor to provide accurate feedback on my heart rate while using an elliptical trainer at the gym - the built-in monitors on these machines were universally useless. It is performing this function nicely. I was surprised to find that the rate was transmitted to the display board on the elliptical machine as well as to the watch - no need to wear the watch! The only problem is that the machine next to mine typically picks up the transmission too. The other minor problem is that the monitor initially showed erratic results. Thanks to other posters, I tried replacing the battery which seems to have fixed that problem."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"A lot of the reviews that I read before purchasing this item were positive, so I had great hopes for the Timex T5G971 heart rate monitor. The price is great, but I guess you get what you pay for. My biggest complaint is that it is very difficult to program, and the instruction book is very little help. I never did figure out some of the features. The other problem is that I don't always find it to be accurate. Typically it's in sync with the built-in heart rate monitor on the treadmill at the gym, but sometimes the rate displayed on the monitor drops so dramatically, I know it's definitely wrong. Maybe others will have better luck with this product than me."
3,It is a good value overall,"This will give you a good baseline, but never rely on it for ""real time"" accuracy. Works perfectly to give you a resting heart rate but is VERY sensitive to your body's movement and readings will jump all over the place.Seriously though, for what you pay, I think it is a good value and very reasonably priced. I would recommend it to anyone who works out and just wants to dabble in heart rate monitoring while exercising."
1,Timex struck out twice.,"The Timex personal trainer was my first heart rate monitor. It worked well for about 6 weeks, then the transmitter stopped sending a signal. The ""water proof"" casing on the transmitter wasn't waterproof, and perspiration obviously had gotten into the battery and caused it to corrode. It failed to work when I replaced the battery, so I called Timex. They sent a replacement (about 4 weeks later). The replacement never worked. The problem is not in the watch, but in the transmitter. I know this because when the first transmitter was working, the cardio equipment on which I work out would pick up the signal from the transmitter. Timex struck out twice. Today I ordered a Polar FT1 - hope I have better luck with it."
1,"Ready, Set, FAIL!","Can't really rate the performance of this piece because once I slapped it on my scrawny wrist, it failed. I was able to set the time, then as i began the heart monitor, major fail. Indiglo didn't work, nothing worked. Forget trying to open this as well. With the 4 screws, and band that unconventionally wraps around the back case, it becomes an impossibility. Unfortunately, that was the only way to reset the watch. Again, fail.I give it one flush."
1,Sending it back...,"It works great for a while, then stops for no reason. I changed the batteries; however it stops working after about an hour.. I like to monitor my heartrate and see how many calories I am buring during the day, this unit does not allow that to happen.. It is on its way back and I ordered a Polar.."
5,Inexpensive Tool For Avid Exercisers,"This is a great product for anyone looking to engage in exercise.I've had it for months now (Maybe 6 months?) and the battery still works. I've counted my BPMs, and while it isn't perfectly in-sync, it's very close.The watch displays not only the heart rate, but calories burned, time in the gym, and more.The sensor that goes around your chest is a bit annoying at first, but it's not terrible once you adjust it and get used to it.Definitely a 5/5 product, especially for the price."
3,Calorie count off,"Bought this for my wife for her bike rides. She says she likes it but that the calorie count is really off, by about half. That is, it shows you've burned 2000 when you've only burned 1000. Rechecked her setup and it appears correct. Other than that she decided to keep it, she just gives herself half the calorie credit that the watch suggests."
1,Never got a pulse reading,Bought at local sports shop for $50 then when got home read the directions and tried it out. Wetting the strap is necessary according to directions and sales staff. Never got a pulse. Took back to store and tried another same model... no pulse. Sales guy tried it on... no pulse. Either we found two defective from Timex or you got to be soaking wet to get the strap to sense a pulse. Wasted my time and the store's time. That's what I get for going cheapest first.
3,Manual Needs Work,"After reading the reviews I bought this (my first) heart rate monitor. The first TIMEX arrived and I managed to make it work but then could not set the heart functions again. I would cycle thru the TIME SETTING functions and then never could get to the HEART SETTING functions.I then sent it back and with AMAZON's execellent refund policy I got a new one in a few days.The second one had the same problem so I decided it must be my problem and re-read the manual (it skips around). I discovered to get to the HEART SETTING functions I needed to first press the ON/OFF button and then the SET button whereas the TIME FUNCTIONS only require the SET button.My first (wrong) insticts were that I could press the SET button and set all the functions (WRONG). Anyway this took condsiderable time to figure all this out so Iask TIMEX to make this clear.Other than the above, I find the device works well."
3,"Works well, but won't communicate with Precore & Free Motion machines","I got this to replace a Polar F4. The Polar chest band still works on the machines at the gym, but the watch battery died after three years. With the replacement battery, all of the functions work, except it does not pick up a heart rate. I bought this Timex because I like the replaceable battery aspect. The watch picked up the heart rate from the strap quickly on first use, and I like the big numbers on the face of the watch. I'm a big guy (56R suit jacket) and the strap fit fine. Everything was great until I got to the gym and found that none of the Precore or Free Motion machines at the gym would pick up the heart rate from Timex strap. So, I am returning it and will try an Omron."
3,its ok but doesnt do what i hoped for,"I have been working hard at exercising and losing weight since January . . . i purchased this because i wanted to keep an eye on my heart rate and calories burned. Well, it does tell me my heart rate which I feel is accurate . . but calories burned is way over inflated which is discouraging. Its ok and I will continue to use it, but it is true from what others have said . .calories burned is NOT accurate!"
4,Effective Monitor,"Monitor is accurate and is easy to set the weight and min/max heart rate. LCD is clear and easy to see with an indiglo for those that like to jog at night. I enjoy this monitor as it helps keep me in my ""zone"" and burn more calories.The buttons can be a little hard to press for some and I wish the recall was for more than just the very last session you recorded but overall this is an easy to use almost full feature monitor for a great price. Can't really go wrong with it if you need a heart rate monitor."
2,Heartless monitor,"This item performed very erratically. When I first hooked it up, it immediately showed my heart rate but after a few minutes it stopped. I tried using electrode gel, repositioning the sensor, checking the battery with a checker - nothing worked. Over the next days I tried several times to get it to work, fidgeting with the battery, gel, positioning and tensioning the strap. It would function sporadically for a few minutes and then stop. When it did respond is was very accurate - the rate was identical to that obtained with an electronic cuff blood pressure monitor. I went to the Timex web site which was not helpful (the manual sucks). It is interesting that the 40 reviews posted on the Timex site were considerable less positive than those on the Amazon size. The average rating was 2.5 stars and only 35% would recommend it to a friend. After wasting much time I returned the watch."
2,Don't use in a pool.,There's nothing in the manual about using this swimming. I didn't press the buttons underwater. But after the first swim it isn't working like it was before. It shows a HR of 30 out of the water. Now I can't use it cycling.
1,Stay FAR away,"I didn't buy this HRM from Amazon but from my local best buy instead. I used it once and wound up returning it because of how awful and inaccurate it is!First off this is a Unisex HRM, so any calorie count that you are getting is based off a male because you cannot enter your gender into this HRM.Second, there is no way to enter your age. So you don't know if you are getting the count of a 10 yr old Male or 50 year old male.Three, you can't enter height. Someone who is shorter vs someone who is taller are going to have very different calorie burnsWhile you can enter your weight into the watch that doesn't mean a darn thing because you have none of the other info. As my mom's personal trainer said, it's like have a portable treadmill on your arm since for most treadmills that what you enter into the machine.I would caution anyone who is looking for an affordable HRM to stay far away from this one and save up for a Polar instead."
5,Great basic monitor,I bought this product over a year ago. It is a great basic/ midrange heart rate monitor. It is very sturdy and I have had no trouble with for over a year now. I use it about 5-6 times a week. It allows you to enter your age and weight making the readings more accurate. I love this product!
3,HEART RATE AND CALORIE MONITOR,"Very hard to program, (impossible for a non technical person, I had to have help) directions very difficult to understand. Does not work as expected, monitor stops counting time and calories when activity is stopped for a short time and resetting is rather confusing."
3,Not for Fat People..,"I bought this product after reading that it was recommended for larger people, and the chest strap fit no problem but the sensors are not sensitive enough to pick up my heartbeat. I contacted timex customer service and told them my size and the problem I was having, and that this item doesn't work for someone my weight. I few weeks later I got a reply from customer service telling me that yes it does. That ticked me off.. I mean here I am.. wearing the thing. Several smaller people tried it on and it works like a charm. Larger people.. no dice. I gave mine away."
2,Not so good,This thing is pretty unrelieable. I use it daily when riding my bike. At least once during the ride the signal will drop out and I lose all data. I can also count on it registering false readings (too high or too low) on a regular basis.
4,Heart Rate Monitor by Timex,"Bought the HRM a few weeks ago, once I switched this on it works no problem setting up very simple and fast, however there is a bit of controversy on the heart rate, most people say 220 max minus the age example 220-50=170 amx heart rate. However the chart is different. I suppose it depends on the level of fitness and activity. Overall happy with this product.Should have spent a bit more so that can monitor the distance travelled on my bike."
3,Timex HRM,"This product is the first HRM I have ever bought. I bought it because it was simple, easy to operate, and relatively cheap. It is fairly accurate and responsive. I have even been able to use it while swimming.The one complaint I have is that the clasps on the chest strap are made out of plastic; repeated use can easily get them twisted and worn out. I suspect that mine will break shortly. They can also be undone inadvertently as this has happened to me while trying to shift the chest strap under my shirt."
4,Timex Heartrate Monitor,Works great and is very accurate. Would definitely recommend. I use it for spinning classes to monitor how I get my heart rate up to different levels.
3,could be better,"this is my 2nd timex HRM watch. my 1st watch had all the bells & whistles (timer, stopwatch, peak HR, average HR, minimum HR, zone settings, alarm, dual timezone), but after 5years that watch underwent 3trips to the timex repair center - the last one being unproductive & ended with me getting a refund for the repair.i then bought a non-timex HRM, but had a terrible using it.i bought this watch expecting the same satisfaction as from my 1st timex.results? mixed feelings.good: the communication with the chest strap is the same as my 1st timex HRM - great. (this was my main problem with my non-timex HRM, the signal from the chest strap would be intermittent. i honestly believe my last 21k was badly run because my HRM never measured!)bad: no stopwatch, the chest strap kept coming loose.summary: yes, i'd recommend it."
5,Great workout information,"This is very comfortable to wear and it gives great information. I even wore this all night just to see what my lowest recorded heart rate was. Large display good to be able to see for us over 45ers. Not too overly complicated to initially set, just sit down and take your time with it if you want to be able to set all the features. Great job Timex!"
4,Great entry-level HRM--highly recommended,"For an entry-level device this one rocks! I bought this HRM to help my training program and am not disappointed. It works with the cardio equipment at the gym (Lifecycle brand) so I can focus on my workout, not my wrist. Even when I do look at the HRM display, it is large enough to see while running, so bouncing is not a major concern. It may not be the most attractive timepiece, but it works exactly as designed. Add to that the user-changeable battery on the chest strap (Polar and others do not offer this feature) and you have a nice device that will be a great work out partner for years to come.So far, accuracy is solid and the functions that I need are there--plus some I didn't realize I wanted before I had them. I love the post-workout breakdown of max and average HR, time in the zone (that you define), and calories burned (based on your weight and HR).If what you need is a basic, high-quality HRM, this one gets two thumbs up."
1,Very Inaccurate Calorie Calculation,I bought this product and am very disappointed by its inflated calories-burned calculator. It doesn't ask for gender or age. Do your research. The calorie calculator is worthless.
2,"Good at tracking heart rate, not calories burned","Base on my own manual testing, this did seem to track my heart rate very well. The instructions were a little daunting based on the manual supplied with the watch, but after some tinkering I figured it out pretty quickly. My only complaint about this product is in it's ability to track calories burned. I'm a big guy and expect to burn more than the average fit person but for 60 minutes of intense cardio (P90X)it calculated that I burned 1,320 calories. That would be fantastic if I could believe it. Using some various web calculators to estimate calories burned (even one that takes into account additional information such as sex and average heart rate) my highest estimate was about 740 calories. It's hard to believe that this watch is providing reliable numbers.So I'm giving it 2 stars because the calorie counting function was of particular interest to me and part of my motivation for purchasing this product."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this product because I mainly just wanted to monitor my hear rate during workouts - ie Running, weight lifting etc. However, that is the one thing that this product did NOT do. I would start my workout and try to get the heart rate monitor to work for the first 15 minutes. Finally, it would kick in, so I would start running or doing my work out only to have it suddenly say my HR was 60BPM when I could barely breathe. I tried moving the monitor to see if I had placed it on the wrong spot. No matter where I put the monitor it probably would only actually work 10 mins out of a 60 min work out. This product was a huge disappointment. After trying to get it to work the entire time for multiple workouts with no success, I returned it. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless they don't actually want it to monitor their HR all the time."
5,Perfect!,No need for those expensive fancy ones...this does it all and very easy once you read the insatructions....Would not trade it for anything!!!
4,"Good, Simple, and Easy to Use","I had looked at different heart rate monitor watches and saw this one had the best ratings for the price range. I didn't want to wait for the delivery so instead I bought a different brand at Walmart for a few dollars more. I was unsatisfied with the other brand and returned it. I bought the Timex on Amazon and I like it much better. It has a more intuitive interface that makes it easy to use. I haven't used it enough to comment any more on it but based on looks, features, ease of use, and price, I give this 4 start."
1,Unreliable,"Bought one. A few months later, it stopped working. I returned it to Timex and they replaced it. A few months later, the replacement stopped working. I give up."
1,"Okay at first, but does not last","I bought this HRM less than a year ago. It was my first hrm and is okay for basic functions. After some time though it only picked up my heart rate sporadically. Also, the chest strap broke, which basically makes it unusable. I was hoping this product would last at least one year, but alas it did not. Spend the extra twenty and get a polar. That is what I am getting now."
4,Great price but missing some features,"The price is great on this heart rate monitor watch, but beware that it's missing a key feature for runners (and other athletes) - a stop watch! Also it would be nice to see the date on the main display without having to press a button."
2,Works fine except Calories Count,"I have attached it to my bike (Yes there is Timex Watch Attachment). Heart rate and all functions work fine.Sometimes I miss not having 2 profiles, but you get what you pay for. This was cheap and delivers.NOTE: Calories count is way off :(Update:After about 7 months of use, watch has started losing connection in middle of workout. Because of this, I lose all previous data when I reconnect."
4,Good product for the money,"Some of the reviews state that the calorie count seems too high, and I would haveto agree with that. Otherwise it is very easy to use and the heart rate seemsaccurate. Overall a good product at a good price."
1,Bad Calorie Counter,"Had to return it twice and eventually requested refund because calorie counter doubles calories (and did on both watches I received from Amazon). Heart rate monitor (chest strap) very accurate but it doesnt do you any good when the counter broken. I knew something was off when the watch said I burned 800 calories on an easy 3 miler.When I look at the watch on the internet, it appears others have had same problem."
2,"Great at first, Fails after 8 months","Timex makes great sport watches. I had hopes that this heart rate monitor would also be great, and after 4 months of almost daily use I was pleased and would have given it 5 stars. Then it started acting erratic, giving occasional bad readings that increased with time until it finally became useless. The heart rate monitor part of the watch no long turns on. I tried replacing the batteries but that had no effect. It still works great as a watch."
4,"Great heart rate monitor for the money, but hard to use at first","I was really impressed with the quality of this heart rate monitor for the cost. I've been using it for 1.5 months with no issues. I've compared it to other equipment and seems to have accurate results. Only flaw is the lack of instructions when setting up the watch. To setup your calorie burning info you must have the heart rate monitor on.Also, the watch has a lot of adjustments so it even fit my tiny wrist."
5,My Heart Beats,"I have used this once, it was awesome. Accurate and easy to use!My lovely wife let me get this for Christmas and since I was home when UPS knocked I got to use it. It is highly addictive and I made the mistake of leaving it out so she could have Santa's elves (lovely daughters) hide it. I am having withdrawals and can't wait till Christmas day.The immediate feed back is amazing, setup is easy, and the helpful tips for finding your max heart rate are excellent. If you are lucky enough to get one, enjoy. It is not the same working out without it.It changes your view on working out and it makes it much more effective, and no, the heart rate readers on all exercise equipment is notoriously wrong (unless you think my 40 year heart can go from 180 to 60 to 118 in 15 seconds then go back to 58 to 153 to 98)."
4,Exercise watch,"Both my husband and I have these watches. They work great and give us (both in our sixties) confidence that we're not working TOO hard. We use them bike riding at least three times a week, 15 to 20 miles each ride. His first watch lasted three years, but we like HOW they work so well and the price is right... so he just replaced his first one. They are worth it."
5,Very accurate,Fits me and I'm 225 and wear a 50 coat. Save the money and get this item unless you're a Ironman etc.
2,No Stopwatch?,"I couldn't believe that this watch did not have a stopwatch. It seems to me to be a pretty standard function of a watch, even a basic one like this. The majority of people using this watch most likely want it for running, but the lack of a stopwatch to do any sort of pace work or speed work makes this only useful for people who don't care about time. If you want a stopwatch and a few more functions, without paying too much more, take a look at the Timex T5J031. It's only slightly more money, but it has many features that I would think most people would deem necessary."
5,The Timex T5G971 A Perfect Choice,"If you are looking for a heart monitor which is easy to use and very accurate this is the one for you. I am 53 y.o. in cardiac rehab. A similar Timex model was one of the HR monitors recommended by the rehab staff. However after much comparison shopping, this monitor had additional features including calorie counting, target heart rate beep which you activate if you want it on and indigo light. The strap is very light and comfortable. It is also extremely accurate and it comes with a user replacement battery. I just love it."
3,All good except chest strap,"I've owned this heart rate monitor for almost a year, but I can't use it now because the chest strap broke. The clasp on the elastic part going into the sending unit broke off when I was taking it off. I have e-mailed Timex in an attempt to get a replacement strap. I would hate to have to buy a new monitor just for this strap. Other than that, the monitor worked great. I used the sending unit to feed both the Timex heart rate montitor watch that came with it and a receiving unit that I bought separately that can be hooked up to my computer to record a workout's data. It did a great job before the strap broke. If the clasp hadn't broken, I would have given the monitor another star."
2,Calorie Counter is WAAAAAAY off,"I bought this HRM to keep track of how many calories I was burning during my workout. I have started a new reduced calorie diet, and knowing how many cals I burn during a workout is pretty important. During a 30 minute light jog, this Timex told me I burned 700 cals. Ummm yea, I wish. If that was the case I wouldnt be on a diet!!!!!!! I made sure I set up the info correctly and gave it another try the following day. Same ridiculous amount. FYI, this kind of workout only burns 125-300 cals.If your looking for a basic HRM to track BPM, to make sure you stay in a certain zone while working out, and dont care about calorie count then this is a great affordable option. If you want to track calories burned, look elsewhere."
5,Works great,So far i've just used it as a straight heart rate monitor and its worked great. Works first time every time. And also communicates with all of the machines at my gym. Price is great also.
5,Timex T5G971 Unisex Sports Personal Heart Rate Monitor Watch,I am very happy with the watch and waist monitor. One great feature is that I can change the batteries myself when the time comes! Lots of great features for the money. Very reliable and fast pick up of the heart rate. Easy clean up after a work out.
2,Looks nice but wrong calculations,"I used this heart rate monitor watch for couple days, but it turned out that the calculations provided by this watch are not accurate.To calculate the calories consumption, you need to provide the gender, the weight and the heart rate. This watch depends on just the heart rate for the calories calculations.Once it gave me a reading of 350 burned calories but with the right calculations they were just 150 calories.I would not recommend this heart rate monitor watch, since it is not accurate."
1,Timex Makes A Good Watch,"I bought one of these monitors when the Omron HR-100C I had been using failed after 18 months. I basically relied on the Timex name and reviews of the produvt on this site. My experience was decidedly inacceptable. The Timex chest strap worked well for 30 days, after which I had to replace the battery. That was repeted two more times before the watch quit receiving data from the strap. I checked the chest strap using a new Omron watch and it continued to work for about 2 weeks, it them also went completely dead.I have gone back to the Omron product which at least worked for 18 months before. I still use the Timex as a watch only and it performs that function well. My conclusion is if all you want is a watch, get a Timex. If you want an HRM, better get something else! It may be the higher priced Timex products are more reliable, but who wants to spend that kind of money to find out."
1,Doesn't work,"After ignoring the reviews I bought this. As many people have noted, the watch doesn't get signal from the monitor. This product stinks."
2,Disappointed!,I am very disappointed with this watch. This is a sophisticated watch and has no chronometer!!!!I was very surprised with this issue when I received the product in Argentina.
1,Inaccurate calorie burn,"I found the calories burned to be WAY off. I had heard that the cardio machines overestimate calories burned, so imagine my suprise when this HRM read about 100 calories over the machines, even when I only worked out for 10 minutes. I would suggest spending a little more money and getting a Polar HRM. I retured this one and got the Polar FT4 and I LOVE it. Much more accurate and comfortable."
1,Overrated,Regardless of Timex's past history their latest products are not worth the money regardless of the amount. Watched worked for three days and then stopped receiving heart rate results no matter what level I set. Useless
1,Piece of crap.,"Wow, I this is my first Heart Rate monitor, and it ALWAYS lets me down when I need it most. Whenever I really start pushing myself and my Heart Rate starts getting into the 170+ range, this thing always starts 'freezing' up and showing a much lower heart rate. For example, I may be at 190 BPM but the watch will only show me at 40 BPM (which is below my resting heart rate) and it will stay there for 2-3 minutes before it is accurate again. I absolutely hate this product and wish I could get my $$ back."
1,Not Pleased,Heart Rate feature only worked occasionaly. May have just been battery but they shouldn't send them out with old battery. Watch band looked very cheap. The plastic band will not last long.
1,Arm Bankd Broke First Day,I purchased this product due to a consumer reports rating. My husband wore it the first time and busted the wrist band. It is too difficult to fix on our own. I don't recommend this product.
1,Buyers Beware! Don't Buy! Defective!,"I tried two of this Timex heart rate monitors, neither of the original item nor the replacement worked. It just received the heart rate signal for the first 10 minutes, then stopped showing anything. The replacement watch just showed very random heart rates, jumping from 90 to 80, then 60 within 5 seconds.I followed the instructions/suggestions carefully (wet the sensor, change the battery ...). The monitor just did not work. Maybe there's something wrong with the quality control of the company. I can see other recently buyers complaining the monitor not working.I will return it for refund."
1,Great when it worked,Worked great for the first month and then it stopped transmitting. Replaced that batteries and it did not help. Went to a Polar to replace it and it works much better and more consistently.
4,"Nice product, great price","These product have everything you need to get in shape at the gym. I have been using it for about three weeks and I have lost already 16 pounds, not only because I have used the watch, I also went to the nutricionist and we made a program of exercises based in my heart rate, wich I control using the timex watch. therefore I recomend these product to all of you who want to get the most from the gym."
4,Good price and accurate enough,"this product is really good it gave accurate results without applying any gel or any liquid and it gets heart rate pretty fast. The only problem that i found is the signal is not encoded, so wen i go to gym my treadmill automatically picks the signal from this monitor but when I checked other machines in the gym all are getting my heart rate so it is a kind of weird. besides that it is a great product and easy to use instructions I don't know why people say it is hard to use 4 stars from my side"
4,"Awesome device, especially for the price!","My wife has been using it when she works out and she loves it. The only complaint/comment that she has is during the ""work out"" mode, you can switch back and tell time. However, it seems very common on most heart rate monitor on the market."
1,Don't waste your time...,"This product does not work. It took me hours to get it to read my heart rate, then it malfunctioned 4 times during my workout (which happened to be only 20 minutes). After that, it would not read my heart rate period. I did everything the instructions said to do, I looked at reviews and did what they said, and I talked with the manufacturer... NOTHING ABOUT IT WORKS! I ended up returning it and am going to try a different brand."
2,stopped using it,I found this HR Monitor and watch to have a lot of functionality but I had a hard time getting it to work correctly and match up so that I could use it appropriately. I used it for a little while and just stopped using it.
2,not satisfied with the monitor,"i am not satisfied with the monitor, at the fist two months the monitor was working good, after that it does not receive any signal ,from the heart monitor, i did all that the manual says if case that the monitor presents some problems , but the monitor is not giving any signal,and is not doing its job properly.I would like to have a response because i bouth it as a gift for my wife she runs and she is very disapointed with these situation,thanks very much,"
1,IT MIGHT BE WORTH THE PRICE IF ...,"I purchased this HRM watch from Amazon and received it within two days (using free shipping!). Unfortunately, the HRM portion of the watch doesn't work at all (dead battery in chest strap?) and Timex doesn't offer convenient assistance so I am returning the watch to Amazon today. I really should have known better than to purchase a Timex product. I have owned two Timex Data Watches and a somemwhat expensive Timex Ironman all of whick lost most of their functionality within two years! Back to Omega, Casio and Seiko."
4,Cardio exerciser,This monitor works well & is easy to use. Its weakness is that it doesn't store more than your last event.
2,Not comfort,"I bought this after my polar heart rate monitor broke. The band is VERY uncomfortable and it pinches. It cannot be used when sitting down because it lifts off my ribs. The polar is much more comfortable. Another minus is that you cannot see your calories, workout time and heart rate at the same time."
1,Cheap Quality,"The day I got it, it started randomly resetting (consistently) while in heart rate monitoring mode. RMAing it now. I've had bad luck with Timex in the past, but I thought I should give them another try because all of the positive reviews. Never again."
3,"ok, not great.","I wanted to know calories burned and heartrate during my workouts. The calorie counter was too difficult to work. In fact, I could never make it work. Difficult to manuver because of placements of buttons to press. I need easy!!"
2,Not worth the money...,"First purchased one of these in Feb. '11, it lasted 1-1/2 years before it started to burn out. So, thought I'd try again because the price was right & I thought having a replaceable battery in the chest strap was a plus, evidently not as this one only lasted 4-1/2 months. I sweat a LOT when I work out and I think that gets into the battery compartment of the chest strap. I tried opening the battery compartment after workouts to let it dry thoroughly, but once it again it either gives erratic HR readings or won't work at all. Once again, you get what you pay for. Should've gone Polar from the beginning."
2,Don't waste your money,"I've bought several HRMs over the last 15 years. For about $40 I've been able to get basic functionality that lasts about 3-4 years, assuming I'm able to replace the batteries. I bought this Timex less than a year ago. About 80% of the time it would give me a heart rate that seemed accurate; 20% of the time it would go into la-la land and show either 60bpm in the middle of a hard interval or 217bpm during my cool-down. I joked to my companions that it was really a random number generator that beeps.After several sessions I determined that it occurs when (a) there are power lines within ~50 yards or (b) I had a head wind of more than 5mph.In less than a year the batteries are showing signs of wearing out, so I'm going to take the opportunity to replace this pathetic thing. I realize Timex has a reputation for cheap, unreliable products. This HRM only underscores this reputation."
4,Doing what it is designed for . Accurate by my health care nurse.,"no change to design, Accurate. I like it. Use it on the treadmill, which has aan inaccurate monitor. Good for the money."
3,"Not bad for the price, stopped working after a few months","The monitor worked great, for about the first six months. After a while the heart rate on the monitor would jump from 60bpm up to 175bmp, then it just stopped working all together. I don't know if the monitor and watch somehow became ""unsynched"" but the monitor function on the watch is useless to me now. Loved the product up until it stopped working..."
2,Sensor in Chest Strap Gave in After 1.5 Years,"This product worked well for 1.5 years. After that time the watch began to have trouble picking up the heart rate from the sensor in the chest strap. I replaced the battery in the sensor and in the watch. The watch works fine. The sensor still doesn't work properly. Sensor problems include never establishing a connection with watch, ridiculously low heart rate, and dropping the connection with watch."
1,Terrible produce,"Never worked. I'm not sure if it was the watch itself or the sensor, but it never synched. I recommend the Polar. Won't buy Timex for this purpose again."
4,Timex heart rate monitor watch,"The product works as advertised, but the face is a little dark. Not enough contrast between numbers and background. Not as clear as it appears in the photo, but it does the job."
5,Great!,I love the fact that I can use this in treadmills that have heart monitors and don't have to worry about looking at my watch. It is small enough for a woman and it works great. I wish it had an alarm though.
3,Good heart rate monitor but lacks stopwatch functionality,"As mentioned by other reviews, this watch is a good and reliable heart rate monitor. Based on my limited time with the watch it did measure my heart rate accurately. What was a deal breaker for me is that the watch lacks traditional stopwatch functionality. A timer does start when you turn on the heart rate monitor. However, there is no way to start and stop a timer. Even viewing the timer is cumbersome."
5,"In Command, The Mariners","I remember the Mariners from their regular appearance on the Arthur Godfrey show (1949-1955), and always enjoyed their sprit and harmony, so hoped eventually their music would become available on CD. Here it is! A two CD set. The first one contains their most popular songs including all those ranked on the pop charts in the top 20, including Sometime (#16 in 1950), They Called the Wind Maria (#30 in 1951), and I See The Moon (#14 in 1953). The last two were the ones I remembered and wanted most. The second CD includes a variety of genre, including quite a few well known religious songs that I wasn't aware they had recorded. My impression is that the high quality of their harmony is best displayed on some in the latter category. This is a fine CD set that I gladly recommend for those seeking quality harmony from that era, and/or songs by the Mariners."
5,Happy with Amazon,"Got my book in good time, in good condition, at a good price. Couldn't be happeir."
4,Little slow at first but then really gets going,"I give this 4 stars because the beginning is rather slow and drags on a little too much.. From about pg. 100 or so on, things really get going and this novel turns into a real hot romantic psychological thriller. Ms. Jackson develops the characters well and the story is anything but predictable."
2,"Great Book, but the worst editing I've ever seen!","This is my second time reading this book. I read the paperback version a few years ago and loved it so much that I bought the kindle edition. The kindle edition however is very frustrating to read. I don't know what went wrong in the editing process but there are quotes where there shouldn't be, other characters talking in the same paragraph as another so it's hard to figure out who's talking, and there are no spaces separating different scenes in the book. You end up reading a few paragraphs before you realize it's someone else's point of view a few days later. I'm sorry I wasted the money on the kindle edition, especially since now I'm stuck with it."
5,Great book! A real page turner!,"This book was really great! I could not put it down, and since I live close to New Orleans, where the book was set, it just made it all the more creepy. Had to keep reading til I found out who the killer was! I am actually now in the process of reading the second book, Cold Blooded. Lisa Jackson is definitely an author I will be looking for in the bookstores from now on!"
5,Great Book!,It's very exciting and thrilling. Kept me on my toes all thru the end. Lisa Jackson does have great skills on keeping her fans entertained all thru the end.
4,Kept me reading.,Really enjoyed the book. Started the series by reading Absolute Fear. Had to read them in order!! 1 down. :)
4,Page turner!,"I actually bought the bundle of Bentz and Montoya books. But I don't care to read six 300- 400 page books all at one time. I wasn't sure about this at the beginning, although it started with a bang right away. I just never really cared about the main characters. But the storyline was exciting and it was hard to put down and when I did I couldn't wait to get back to it. I continuously changed my idea of who did it. Although the story comes to an ending, it also bridges itself to the next book in the series, Cold Blooded. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
3,HOT BLOODED,IS THIS AUTHOR FROM NEW ORLEANS? I RENTED THIS FROM LOCAL KINDLE LIBRARY BECAUSE OF THE NEW ORLEANS REFERENCES....BUT WE DO NOT HAVE FREEWAYS IN N'AWLINS......IS SHE MAYBE FROM CALIF?????
3,Good weekend fun,"When Dr. Samantha Leeds receives a crank call during the course of her late night radio show, no one thinks to link it to the murder of a prostitute found in a French Quarter hotel room. As Detectives Rick Bentz and Reuben Montoya investigate, more prostitutes are murdered, and Samantha keeps getting calls. Samantha begins to worry when the calls become more threatening and more personal. And when her neighbor Ty Wheeler comes around with a secret, she begins to wonder if he could be connected to all the problems she's having. Then a woman calls into the show, claiming to be someone from Samantha's past. The only problem is this woman has been dead for years. Who is torturing Dr. Sam, and is this campaign of terror connected to the prostitute murders? And what does this all have to do with Samantha's traumatic past?This is the very first book in the New Orleans series, and the very first one to feature Detective Rick Bentz. A nice thriller to while away the weekend."
3,Took a bit for me to get into,"This is the first book by Lisa Jackson that I have read. It took me awhile to get into the story, but once I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
2,Not bad but had some problems,"This was my first Lisa Jackson book. I enjoyed her style and loved the New Orleans setting. However, even though the story really hooked me for a while, she lost me on page 238. When the heroine kept doing careless things like entertaining a strange man and telling herself over and over again that the weird things that were clearly happening to her was all in her head (even after the cops warned her that the danger was very real), she lost me.I also felt that the heroine didn't really DO much of anything except look sexy and get victimized. I suspect the author could have dropped 50-60 pages and tightened this story up a lot.I imagine writing a book on deadline is pretty hard, so I'll take that into consideration and give Ms Jackson's next effort a try."
4,Captivating,"This is the first Lisa Jackson book that I've read. I did enjoy the book up until say the last 50-60 pages. It seemed that the ending was rushed. What bothered me the most was the fact that a certain character was repetively mentioned but not entirely brought into the story line. Peter was Samantha's long lost brother. The author mentioned him at least 10 times but was a no show. I guess I just wondered what the point was? Other than that, I thought the storyline was excellent and it certainly was a suspense. Even though at times I thought Samantha needed someone to grab a hold of her and shake some sense into her. For a psychologist she was pretty stunned. I was a bit skeptical with her relationship with Ty also in the beginning...but things apparently worked themselves out.I'm not totally convinced enough however to run out and buy Cold Blooded when it hits the stores."
1,Bleech!!,"Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know. But I was VERY disappointed with this book - in fact, I can't bring myself to finish it. I read 100 pages into it and easily put it down. I have never met a main character that I've hoped would be killed off but this one, please! She's boring, shallow with no depth. ..."
5,love it,I had been looking for this book for a while and Lisa Jackson is great romantic suspense writer. Read everything I can get my hands on by her
1,Damaged Book,It was not packed well... just in a standard envelope. Corners of first 25 pages are mashed! Argh!!! I bought it new and wanted it new.
1,Plodding and unispired,"Orchestral phrasing, no less sense of arc through each movement and the larger piece, is just simply non-extant.I read the recommendations on here and bought this because I believed the chorus had nailed it.While I would agree that the recording engineers have done a good job of bringing the chorus forward, and the singers certainly place their final consonants well, no, the sopranos just don't quite make it or hold it all the way up, all the time (no slight to them, the piece is ridiculously demanding vocally).So I'm back to Karajan '77 and Rattle with the Vienna Philharmonic (notwithstanding Rattle's unfamiliar, even alien, sense of phrasing, the sopranos are outstanding)."
2,Metallic taste,"After 30 days use, our coffee has taken on a metallic taste. Maybe it needs a new filter -- which are difficult to come-by.Don't buy Capresso filters #4440.90 as suggested in another review. They are too big."
1,Impossible to find!,"I have this coffee maker which I like very much. HOWEVER, it is IMPOSSIBLE to find the charcoal filter. I cannot find it in any store, have been unable until right now to find it online. Have been very discouraged. These filters (which are vastly overpriced) should be in the store that sells the coffemaker."
3,water filter replacement,"The water filter works as it should. It fits the coffee maker as it should. Only complaint I have is the cost. For such a small item, the cost is much too high. Too bad this item could not be made generic."
2,"Overpriced, but getting better....",I absolutely agree with preceding reviews. Amazon's move to reduce the price by half (to $10 rather than $20)and include free shipping if you buy three (to exceed $25 minimum order)is definately a move in the right direction however.
1,Don't waste your money,"At this price, you'd expect the filter holder to be made of a precious metal. No, you don't need this filter for great tasting coffee. Why not? You can spend the same amount as these two filters and instead buy a Brita or other filter pitcher. Use that water instead of straight from the tap. Don't get ripped off!"
3,Good Filterm but does not fit all models,"This filter does not fit all model. Have late model Brewstation deluxe and had to cut the handle so I could assemble the pot for use. Works great otherwise. This is the filter that Hamilton Beach recommends, but makes no mention of having to be modified."
2,Overpriced & Two Handles Unnecessary,I quickly ordered this without reading the full description and was disappointed to see on delivery that there are only two pods in the package and each comes with it's own handle. Kind of silly And unnecessary when the handle is reusable. I would not order this product again but instead will search for a vendor selling the filter pods only.
5,difficult to find,"My family is a loyal fan of this particular coffee maker, however the filters are becoming more and more difficult to locate. Thank you Amazon!"
3,Why the handle?,"The filters work as advertised, but the box also contains a new plastic handle/holder. This means every time you use two filters you have to throw out a handle. This is a waste of natrual resources and money. It would be better to have an extra filter or two and sell the handles separately. I have been throwing these out for many years and my current Hamilton Beach maker will not accept the longer handled version that comes in the box and I have never felt the need to replace it anyway!Hamilton Beach please take note - this is a wasteful/ungreen practice. If I had options I would use them."
2,Gimmick,"This filter may be adequate if your water issues sparkling from a good well. But if you are using a municipal water supply, forget it. My coffee tasted exactly the same using this filter as it did without one at all--like chlorine! And these little things are pricey. Makes a lot more sense to purchase a water filter pitcher. That way you kill two birds with one stone--clean drinking water AND flavorful coffee."
1,Not necessary -- use a tap filter,"In some areas, particularly those with hard water, but even in areas without hard water and that have chlorinated water, using filtered water to make coffee is definitely preferable; even necessary. However, the shameful wastefulness of these filter pods and handles is NOT necessary. It's just a carbon filter pod, just like what is used in a Pur or Brita faucet filter. It's terrible that the replacements come with extra handles. The handles are reusable, and there is no reason to replace it. Sure, buying new filter cartridges for your faucet filter isn't the most environmentally sound, either (there should be a way to simply replace the carbon inside rather than an entire plastic cartridge), but at least you get more use out of that. Bottom line: Just use an on-tap water filter or a filter pitcher INSTEAD of these filter pods and you will get the exact same result with your coffee."
3,Better tasting coffee,but wish I could just pick these up at Target! I would change them when you want to notice a change in the taste of your coffee to offset their cost.
2,Can't figure out how to get the screen out of Brewmaster,says it fits the Brewmasters but can't figure out how to get the screen out that covers the filter and replacement filter looks too big
4,good service,"The produce is fine but overpriced. It is a proprietary item so they ""gotcha"". I would like to see a six-pack of just the filter modules. The handles can be reused."
4,Pricy but worth it,These shouldn't cost more than a couple bucks a piece. I only paid $40 for the coffee maker. A little charcoal filter shouldn't cost $10. They do however seem to help with the taste of the coffee. Coffee is much better with them. I'll be sure next time to check the price of replacement filters when I'm buying something with one.
2,Doesn't work with older machines as well..,"I bought this as a replacement filter for my older Brew Station. I had to snap the handle off--it was too long--and it doesn't seat snugly in the hole for the bottom filter part, which causes it to leak a little. I needed the older replacement part, but Hamilton Beach no longer has them available, so I'll make do."
2,Ridiculous,"Why can Hamilton Beach get away with selling a water filtered coffee maker, but does not make the filter pod available to their customers? Unable to find them anywhere even in the stores that Hamilton Beach says carries them. When I called HB they said that WalMart and Target sell them----what a joke. The people that work at the stores don't even know what you are talking about and are not even aware that the Brewstation has a water filter (pods) in some models. As long as HB keeps the prices on the filters (including a handle that you don't need)as high as they are, I know that I will not purchase any. And I won't be looking at any HB appliances in the future to buy."
4,They do the job,"I think these water filters make the coffee taste better if the water has chlorine. When the BrewStation was 2 months old, we thought the coffee wasn't tasting as good. I popped a filter in without telling my wife and she asked if I got a new brand of coffee because it was so good. We also have an undersink filter, but I think it needed replacement as well, which I have since done. If you think these cost too much, use bottled water."
3,This is a rip off,I love this coffee maker but I hate having to spend $10 for two of these little filters. Last time I ordered them I bought a plastic bag of six pods for about the same price. I don't need the plastic holder - I have two of them already.
3,A Must for Good Coffee,I am not happy with the fact that my brewstation needs this item in order to brew a good cup of coffee but I knew that going in. It's a must to replace this filter on a regular basis or you will most definately notice in your cup of Joe. Easy to use but a bit pricey for what they are. Just a little sack of charcoal.
3,Needs more per package,"Since these little goobers have to be changed so often, you would think that the makers would have them packaged with more per package. I'd love to get a year's worth in one package rather than have all the wasted boxes, etc. Surely they could come up with a discounted large package. As for how well they work...I'm undecided. I've had my coffee maker for years, but I'm not sure the filters do much...maybe cut down on the bitter taste that hard water can cause. They may also help keep the hard water stains from the inside parts of the coffee maker. I buy them, cause the coffee maker says it needs them. Do they do anything, my jury is still out."
1,water filters,a complete waste of money system works fine without filters. hamilton beach brewer comes with this item so why should i duplicate it
5,An invigorating book,"Enjoyed reading every page of this book. After reading, gained peace of mind and tranquility. It is worth the money."
4,Fundamental Olap principles,"I was impressed by the quality of this book; this is probably the most complete book on OLAP theory and is a fundamental reading for professionals involved in the design of olap systems. In most cases it gives all the details and information needed to master this technology. It also contains some practical examples that are very useful to see how the theory can be applied in the real world.I didn't read the first edition, but the second edition contains new sections and many updates, like a description of SQL-99 OLAP extensions.The author chose to be vendor-independent, so all practical examples are based on a multidimensional language that he created, called Located Contents (LC). However, when I read it I had already used a couple of OLAP tools (Microsoft Analysis Services and Microstrategy), and I think that this helped me understand many of the concepts contained in the book."
4,Good OLAP Methodology,"OLAP is a somewhat arcane corner of the IT universe and this book is a good guide to it for information and business professionals. It covers the basics well and provides decent exaples to get you going.Of course, the hardest part of OLAP is making the conceptual leap from relational databases and transactional processing to the world of analytical processing, but finance experts and accountants will appreciate OLAP and its ability to summarize data in a way that is hard to do in most ERP and legacy systems."
1,Unclear and wordy,"I had high hopes for this book since I am a data miner who senses the need for alternatives to the slow tools commonly used to assemble large data sets for analysis. Unfortunately, I found this book to be overlong and I did not emerge with a clear picture of what distinguished OLAP tools from the alternatives....."
2,Time is valuable. This book is not worth a developers time.,"I have never written a book review, but I felt compelled to write about this book because there are not many good books on OLAP - and this one really misses the mark from a developer's perspective. If you want a book with good examples to get you going with Microsoft's Analysis Service I can highly recommend ""MDX Solutions"".I can only give the book two stars becausea.) I don't want to seem schrill.b.) There may be people out there willing to devote a large amount of time reading a defensively written tome about generic concepts that don't translate into real world products - which in 2006 are way ahead of this book."
5,Please contact me.,I would like to contact the author by email (see email address below). My company is a consulting/traning company with OLAP experience and looking for technology courseware on this subject.
4,"its, nice but its not worth 40 bucks","Unless your a big fan, I don't recommend shelling out the dough for this two disc set as nothing really stands out about this cd to validate the price."
3,Why 2 discs?,"I agree with the above review for the most part. He's right on with the songs that are really bad. Had those been left out and this cd condensed down to just one disc, we'd be looking at a pretty good release. Unfortunately a few tracks are just painful to listen to.The ratings above on Disc 1 are a little high, most notably the title track, which is pretty awful (hip hop & electronica often don't mix). And he didn't even mention the 2 best tracks of the album, Christiane & Existe -- chillout tracks with a ""secret agent"" edge to them.All in all, not as good as Electro Glide in Blue (then again it doesn't get much better than that), but close to Getting High on Your Own Supply."
3,Apollo 440 - Dude Descending a Staircase,"I'm running, rollin', tumblin', flipping through the dry grass like a cigarette carelessly tossed from a passing car, turning the field into an orange ball of fame, twisting in the smoke as it rises, caught on the heat thermals, combusting one roof after another, causing residents to dive into their swimming pools as pine trees pop and bust into towering candles against the night sky ... and that's all just to the track ""Time Is Running Out,"" a sexy cheap infectious number that will highjack you into another dimension, and cause every stop-sign along the way to become irrelevant.What? You didn't hear me the first time? ...Review by Jenell Kesler"
2,"Sounds predictable, annoying",I found this while doing a search for Brian Adams. It reminds me of sitting in an elevator listening to boy trying to be Tori Amos. The piano is alright. Do we need more of this kind of music? ... The album cover is kind of weird.
3,I LOVE THESE ALBUMS - these mixes however....,"After waiting seemingly a million years for these 2 classic Twilley albums to finally see the light of day on compact disc, it turned out to be a MAJOR letdown. Anyone familiar with the original vinyl issues of both these great albums will be wondering where the guitars all went. SCUBA DIVERS is most egregiously lacking in guitar. I even addressed this sad situation with DT himself, via email, to no avail. It is what it is. So until I pay a professional to do a needle-drop on my unplayed Japanese vinyl pressing, this will have to do. Better than nothing? I'm not so sure.... Don't miss Susan Cowsills OUTSTANDING backing vocals though - real treasure. Dwight had Phil, then Susie - and it's never been that good since!"
4,impressive performance,"This recording was made in April 1982 during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. I've bought many Pavarotti concert recordings, but this concert is definitely one of my favourites, with a very nice atmosphere. Pavarotti sings (inter alia) 'Il Lamento di Federico', 'Torna a Surriento', 'Nessun Dorma', 'Recondita Armonia' and 'E lucevan le Stelle'. I especially like 'Il Lamento di Federico', because Pavarotti succeeds extremely well in expressing Federico's extreme desire. The interpretation of 'E lucevan le Stelle' is extraordinary. It's very macabre, even for the great tenor himself. Unfortunately the orchestra doesn't always play with the same compassion as Pavarotti sings, but that's not a serious disadvantage for a Pavarotti-fan!"
5,Pavarotti...extraordinario!!!,"Este cd grabado en vivo en el Royal Albert Hall nos presenta a un Pavarotti en un momento maduro de su carrera- a principio de los años '80. Con una selección de arias intensas de Puccini y sobre todo Verdi, es realmente emocionante.Una de las mejores voces del siglo XX nos regala interpretaciones sentidas, con un timbre de voz diáfano y brillante. Su interpretación de ""E la solita storia"" de Cilea es simplemente escalofriante al igual que la famosa aria ""Nessun dorma"" de la ópera Turandot. Bellísima interpretación también de ""E lucevan le stelle"" de la ópera ""Tosca""La Royal Philharmonic Orchestra es estupenda, simplemente, con un sonido sobrio y elegante bajo la discreta batuta de Kurt Herbert Adler.Un disco de lujo donde podemos apreciar con plenitud la maravillosa voz de este mediático cantante que se ha convertido en leyenda."
5,Wickedest fusion rock in the world,"(...)Today Osibisa is also described as the fathers of World Music, but you know, that World Music thing is really a scam to avoid acknowledging that these bands were some of the wickedest funk/ fusion rock bands in the world. Osibisa and Ofo, two UK bands that rocked the world, defined my youth. There could be no finer cd in your collection if you are willing to step on new territory. Solid stuff always."
5,best of west africa dance club music from the 70's,Osibisa was a band formed by a high school group in Nigeria in the 70's. The melody of the lyrics combined with authentic African konga drums make this a must hear for all music lovers
2,Anti-Semitic literature,"THis is a text that denies the Holocaust. This book claims that the Holocaust was a lie. Apparently the 7 million Jews and million other germans, communists, Gypsies, Catholics and other minorities just immigrated to somewhere, somewhere no one has been able to find them but I guess they didn't leave their forwarding addresses. This book is a hoax and its text is full of hate and racial slurs, terrible misfactuals and contemptable academics. Buyer beware."
5,Willful Ignorance Rewarded!!!!!!!,"Five stars for published proof that ignorance,fostered by blind paranoid,racism, still has a place in America!!!!!! This guy's next book will be that the U.S.A. didn't really land on the Moon!!! That too was a Jewish plot promulgated by NASA to increase tourism in Houston. I LOVE THIS COUNTRY!!!!"
5,An Excellent Compilation,"This disc contains four concertos of Haydn in vintage modern instrument recordings from the 1960s, recordings which hold up more than well both in quality of performance and sound. Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields (Yes, these date from when the hyphens were still there) team with Alan Stringer in the Trumpet Concerto and with Barry Tuckwell for the less often heard Horn Concertos Nos. 1 and 2. The Cello Concerto in C, meanwhile, is rendered by Mstislav Rostropovich and the English Chamber Orchestra directed by Benjamin Britten. This is your father's Haydn, and that's not a criticism in the least. In the case of both ensembles and all three soloists, the playing is smooth, genial good-humored -- everything you'd expect in renditions of Papa's music. For ""old-style modern"" interpretations, as well as a chance to hear those more obscure horn concertos, this release takes a back seat to no one. Highly recommended."
2,Vier Letze Lieder,"Wanted to hear the impeccable Kiri te Kanawa, but found the music of Richard Strauss to be far less than awesome. I can only presume that I have nothing in common with Adolph Hitler, who thought that Strauss was the epitome of art."
5,Wonderful!,"In the broken wasteland of Acomar, a land teeming with starvation and death, the rat Itheem live. Their bones litter the waste, fallen in the endless battles over territory and food. In terror of the Itheem, the canine Uruth built the great wall to keep them imprisoned in Acomar. But with the rising of an overlord, G'Kaa, everything is changing. The Itheem clans are uniting, planning to take the lands of the other races. But what can a free-spirited coyote, Tupan, her greyhound companion Surolf, the pony Hern, and the rebal rat Ra'sish do to stop them? A very good read, simultainously exciting, sad, and laugh out loud funny. Terrie Smith's illustrations are excellent as well. :-)"
2,Disappointed,"I had purchased the First Adams resume book and it was a great help. I purchased the set and it was redundant. Both books had the same examples and I don't feel it offered as much as the first edition. It's good to have, but you could get the equivalent or better searching online for resume samples. If you do purchase it try to find it as cheap as possible."
1,Resume Almanac,what is shown in the picture is the Resume Almanac WITH DISKETT _ BUT what was SHIPPED OUT TWICE me was ONLY the Resume Almanac WITHOUT the DISKETTWhat is Shown in your On line pitcure IS FALSE advertizement...if you are selling the one with the diskett then it should be what is shipped!!!Was very disatified both time!!!

5,inspirational work from a unique young architect.,"A feverish conglomerate of projects which defy the conventional commercial output prevalent in our built environment. Kovac, who I believe is in his thirties has been embraced by several publishers and readers alike for obvious reasons.....His work hovers above a sea of orthogonal pavements. I would like to see much more. Demand a Kovac project - he is the architect of the future."
4,Good buy for the value conscious,"This tote seems durable and well made. It's roomy without being too large. The zippers work well and the lining seems like it will last. The leather is not the highest quality I've ever seen. The photos used on the website must be retouched, because there is no sheen to this leather - it is very flat. However, this is a good buy for the money. If there was a designer name attached to this tote, it would easily be priced 3 times higher."
3,it smells like a farm!,"The design of this bag is fabulous. I love the front pocket, it's like having a separate bag. It looks sturdy, the inside seems sturdy too, the size is just right, the big compartment is, well, big.BUTThe thing smells! My 4 year-old son decreed after holding my new bag for 5 minutes. "" Mom, it smells like a farm."" And he is right. I don't know what they used and what I can do to get rid of that smell. I kept the thing out in the cold, inside in the heat, sprayed Chanel perfume inside. Nothing works. My office reeks like I have a cow hidden in there. It's quite embarrassing, really. I'd be tempted to return it but the price was great and I really like the design and functionality. What to do about the stench???"
4,"nice, but leather is a little different","I like the pockets, color and size of this bag. I do agree with some of the other reviews about the leather. The feel of the leather is not as nice as some of my other leather bags, but I am keeping it."
3,Leather? PLEATHER!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother, and I expected the bag to be made of leather, as the description says ""cowhide leather.""It feels like cheap plastic leather, there is no way that this bag is made of genuine leather.It does, however, have all the pockets described and is the perfect size for a school bag.... I just wish I would have know it would feel so cheap in real life."
3,Does not feel like genuine leather,"I'm happy with the size and pockets of this tote, just what I was looking for. It has a tag that says cowhide leather, however, it doesnt feel and doesnt look like genuine leather at all. It feels like those fake leathers you commonly see in cheap knock-offs. I have lots of leather bags and the material of this tote is not anything like any genuine leather I have seen. I'm giving it 3 stars for the price and for the size and construction. For the price, it is a good tote."

4,A Great Schubert Third!!!!,"I recently have been so happy with the many live performances I have downloaded conducted by Hans Vonk from concert. He was such a gifted conductor, with very persuasive insight and zero pretension. A Shostakovich 10, for instance which I downloaded with the Minnesota orchestra is just exquisite for its perfect combination of Soviet razzmatazz and searing profundity. The performance put me in mind of this great Schubert Third which I completely love and used to play incessantly. It has a similar blustery vibe mixed with charming Gemuetlich edges. Just a gorgeous take on Schubert. The only thing is that the 9th symphony here is kinda dull. But there are a lot of great performances of that work. A great third is more important, and this is it!"
1,Piece of junk!!,"Within a few weeks of buying this item it broke. Some metal pieces came out of it and now it does not clip. Even when it wasn't broken, it still fell off from time to time. If I could I would give this 0 stars. You should not buy this!!"
2,"Quality clip, bad grip on the phone!","The holder is very sturdy, but because of the location that it uses to click into the phone, it is very easy to dislodge. A simple bump by my arm against the antenna has sent my phone flying! Get a case that wraps around or otherwise secures your phone (unless you've got a good warranty!)"
1,non-functioning belt holster,"I was very disappointed in the product.Not only did it take much longer to arrive than anticipated, and that I paid for, when I got the product it was defective and unusable.the hassle and cost of returning it did not make it cost effective and that was also frustrating. So I basically threw about $20 down the toilet."
4,"Similar Product, Excellent Buy","I have a V60i phone right now and have had it for the past 2 years. I bought the same type of clip when I got the phone. The clip was very durable and stood up to all kinds of abuse. The phone never came loose, although I did worry about breaking the clip if I wasn't careful when trying to get the phone out. I never had any problems with the clip coming off my belt either. I did have the clip break twice, though. Both times were at work. Since the clip was made by Motorola and not some off-label third party, it was covered by a full warranty and Cingular replaced it at no cost. Except for the third time (since they don't carry the clip for the V60i anymore) it was a hassle free experience."
4,3.5 Stars,"This is a fast-paced story with an unconventional heroine and a mysterious hero. The heroine's character development was a little uneven, the romance was kind of flat, and I must admit I was disappointed when this book turned out not to be about what I assumed (any explanation would involve spoilers). I'm not sure I'll continue the series. However, it was still a nice read and a nice change of pace. This is a great book for fans of unconventional paranormal that's lighter on the romance."
2,Not to be believed.,"Seriously. I love urban fantasy just as much as the next guy, but the author did nothing to illuminate any character's inner world. Each was flat as a pancake. And all the interpersonal stuff that should make an act of imagination like this interesting was utterly missing. I gave the book two stars for the interweaving of Nazi evil with Indian lore. And even that was a little tough to swallow."
4,Funny and great characters but poor romance and mystery,"I enjoyed most of this book. I am a fan of paranormal romances so this is right up my alley. I really enjoyed the humor and quirks of the characters... smart mouthed cop, foul mouthed octegenarian, Clint Eastwood spouting sheriff etc. BUT I must say the romance was a little unbelievable to me and I solved the mystery early on. On the whole I enjoyed the book. I am looking forward to the next installment."
4,Blue Moon,"I really like reading this book,. It gave a humantouch to a werewolf story and it was great readingThrills and chills, and love and loving, sadnessand happy endings"
4,Very enjoyable!,"If you want to read a delightful story about werewolves and love, read this one. I was able to read this novel in about two days. Give it a chance, you will enjoy it."
4,A good start,"I am a firefighter/paramedic and used this book to help me prepare for my interview last year. The book is somewhat choppy and has some repetitive questions.... but overall its a great starting point for those of us who dont naturally shine in interviews. Like what was previously said, dont mouth the given answers verbatim, but they do a good job of helping you understand the ""power words and phrases"" that interviewers want to hear. Use the suggested answers to form your own creative responses. Oh... and, wear a suit and tie to the interview, wait to be asked to take a seat, shake all hands while looking them in the eye before and after the interview, and try your best to remember names. Also - when answering questions, focus your attention mostly on the person who asked, but dont forget to look at the other members as well. There's my two cents... obviously it worked. Im a paid guy now. Good luck!"
1,Don't waste your time. . .,"In preparing for my latest oral exam I thought that this book couldn't hurt. While it didn't hurt, it certainly didn't help. The first part of the book goes over what to expect during the process, methods used and such. If you are far enough in the testing to get to the oral interview than you are already familiar with the process (or you should be). As for the rest of the book's questions and proposed answers, if you want to sound like a clone then get this book but, in my opinion, it won't help you pass the test in the near future if you pay too close attention.Be original, be confident, and be honest if you are taking the oral. There, all you need to know and I won't charge you a cent."
4,Excellent resource,"I found this book to be helpful, however it was repetitive. It offered tons of helpful questions to think about, but not much in the area of advise.I think this book is a good start for anyone who wants to get an idea as to the type of questions that may be asked during an interview.I did find it helpful that it listed questions that were not related to being a firefighter (for example: questions related to city government and others about the type of certifications/awards/achievements by the local fire agency).Overall, if you have the time to do tons of research, then this is the book for you."
3,Good basic repair manual.,Good for basic repairs but lacking in detail. If you are really serious about doing your own repairs I would recommend something with more detail and greater clarity in the pictures.
1,Does Not Cover all 1999 Models,"Potential buyers should take note that this book does not really cover most VW's that were produced in 1999. It covers only those on the A3 frame, not the A4. The A3 frame was used briefly in 1999 and replaced in 1999 with the A4. VW refers to them both as 1999 models."
2,Review of Chilton's VW-Golf/Jetta/Cabriolet 1990-98 repair manual,"I bought this hoping that I would find enough information to repair a problem with a 98 Jetta. It's always a crapshoot with Chilton's - I was able to fix a 98 Jeep Cherokee with another Chilton's manual I had purchased for that vehicle.I lost this time. The manual lacks in detail - the many sensors the car has are mentioned, but never described. There was no troubleshooting information for any of the sensors I was looking for. There is only basic coverage of the fuel injection system. I was able to find more on Google than in this book.A waste of money for me. your mileage may vary."
1,Haynes repair manual,This book is not up to the standards of any other Haynes book I've ever owned. It is more like the Chilton manuals-poorly illustrated- that created a market for the Haynes manuals in the beginning.
2,Chilton,This is definitely for someone who is not doing extensive work on their car. Lacks in depth explanations and testing procedures. Maybe this book is for amateurs because it is not as in depth as a Bentley manual. But maybe it is designed for novices?????
1,Save Your Money,"Printed on newsprint making photos USELESS!Bought it to repair my AC unit. Chilton advice...go the dealer, USELESS!"
4,"Hurford plays organ ""pops"" pieces","On this particular album, organist peter hurford shows off what the organ can do with a pair of nimble hands (and feet). The recording herein contains all of the more familiar ""pops"" pieces(i.e., you would expect to hear one of these pieces played on nearly every organ recital), and also a rarity or two. The reason I initially purchased this recording was because of the complete Suite Gothique (the only recording available?). Besides the famous toccata, this suite contains some wonderful momemts, such as the sirene priere to the jolly yet sometimes macabre-sounding minuet gothique. The Widor Allegro from Symphonie VI is OK (I still recommend David M. Patrick's album over all others) and the mendelssohn is a nice finishing touch (use this to show off your stereo!) All in all, another well done recording by the scholarly virtuoso Hurford, pleasingly light yet sonically thrilling."
3,"Technically Excellent, but Uninspiring","Hurford is clearly a very capable technical organist. His nimble feet and fingers do an excellent job with fast passages. Musically, however, most of the pieces felt uninspired and I was a bit disappointed."
1,A Poor Imitation of the Original,"If you purchase this version of the well-known Shepherd's Atlas, you are likely to be sorely disappointed. Instead of the colorful maps of the original, all you get are photocopied black and white maps that cannot possibly convey the overall patterns or the details properly. Note that the 5-star reviews were taken from another version of the book and reused here--very misleading. In addition. some of the photocopying was done very sloppily. I feel that I wasted my money and resent that I was tricked. One sees that sometimes it pays to handle a book in a real store before purchasing it. One star!"
2,Surely only for Shirley,"As far as I know, this is Shirley Verrett's only studio recording of Azucena. Buy this recording just for that. She is slightly past her prime. Her ""past her prime"" is still a thrilling achievement.One star for the sonics. One star for the star of this recording, Shirley Verrett."
3,ONLY VERRETT,"This Trovator to needs know for Verrett Azucena. Her voice is deteriored, but timbre and range(emit cleary the D5 of ""tu la sprimi del mio cor"")are magnificient. Not one Azucena, i repeat, not one harmonize this personage as Shirley Verrett. In ""strana pietà"" she is capable to reveal her bewildemont and in her ""Ah!"" when is in front Luna's count to give a physical sensation of to go back: fantastis!"
5,Great book!,"I purchased this book because I knew one of the attorneys in it. Unfortunately, Mr. Hardy passed away prior to me receiving the book. Great read and I had a personal interest in this."
3,A good read but not a good account,"I first read this book out of interest in this particular murder case. In that aspect I found it disappointing. As I am personally acquainted with some of the investigators and one of the witnesses, I didn't find it to be completely accurate regarding the case; having known so many Marines and Gulf War veterans, I found it's characterizations to be sweeping generalizations; having lived in 29 Palms, I found it to be glarely inaccurate in its portrayal of the area and, yes, offensive.However, in re-reading this just as a crime story, it makes for a good read. Like those movies you enjoy that are ""based on"" or ""inspired by"" a true story, it is much better if you don't really know the true story. Allowing then that this is a fictionalized account, it is well written and at times a real page-turner."
1,"Twentynine Palms: A True Story of Murder, Marines,","I still have not finished this book, I am trying, but the authur seems to be writing about everything but the murder, I am getting a history lesson on everything, seems as if authur had a lot pages to fill to make a complete book, maybe sooner or later I will get to the story that the Title says the book is about, If I don't tear the book up first, in flustration. I have lived in Twentynine Palms, and I just don't know where the authur got the idea what people are like there, not the same kind of people I knew."
5,One of the best!,"I came across this book just by chance and I am so glad I did. It is a truly gripping true crime saga so well told by this author, Deanne Stillman. What an amazing talent. I hesitate to use the term but this book really is a""page-turner"". I started in the morning and just kept reading throughout the day. One of the best books I have read this year. What is also amazing is the way she created such a sense of place. I have passed through Twentynine Palms only a few times, but I feel I know it better than I do my own city. This is a must-read!"
2,Fact or Fiction...,"i read Stillman's book on the advise of the L.A. Times ""best of "" non-fiction of the year.And then i went to the reader's review on the AMAZON board.From all this i came away with three basic's...one is that for a read touting itself as a ""non-fiction"",TWENTYNINE PALMS wobbles. Two is that the readers who rated it poorly had their opinions based in fact,compared to the high starrers who think ""gonzo journalism"" equals the truth. Finally the third basic is that the la times ""best of"" is suspect...thank you and good day...."
1,What a World!!,"This books holds 277 pages. I lost complete interest on page 92. Before that, I started to get the understanding that EVERY male character in the book is either a drunk, a wife/child beater, and a rapist. Or even all three!! ALL the female characters (with respect to the actual people this book was written about) are all classic ""victims"". I have been to 29 Palms when I served in the Marine Corps (1987-92). Knowing that I know about my time in the Corps and the fellow Marines (both male and female) I have met. This fictional outlook on the people who make up the Marine Corps is biased and negative. The author makes it a point to show her Liberal outlook and blames the Marine Corps for the murders. (...)One thing that I got from this book after I finished reading it. Is that ""A True Story"" in the title is far fetched to say the least. (...)As always, respectfully submitted."
4,Standard Bar,"The 7' Standard Bar is a relatively good bar for the money. There was a slight problem finding a pair of spring collars to fit the bar. The pair I purchased at Dick's Sporting Goods didn't fit, but the pair I bought on ebay did. The grip of the bar is good as I've not had any problems with slippage. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
5,Excelent!!!,"What can I say, now the family can play together and it's very fun, it works perfectly. fun...tastic."
5,As good as it gets!,"This is another great version of Callas's <<La Gioconda>>. Compare to EMI version, Callas is more outburst and powerful! According to Grammophon publications article(and information written on the back of this CD set), ""Callas herself said to have commented of her part in the last act; ""It is all there for anyone who cares to understand or wishes to know what I was about.""...she turns what can be a maudlin act into real tragedy; that is the alchemy of a great artist...She completely identifies herself with Gioconda's fate throughout, depicting the unhappy ballad-singer's love, hate, jealousy and eventual magnanimity with absolute conviction and without a trace of artifice."" Get it and listen to it!"
5,PURE GENIUS (complete Atlantic recordings,"A stunning collection of Rays Atlantic years consisting of his entire output on 6 cds,1cd of out takes and a concert dvd.The packaging is something to behold,a facsimile of a 1950's portable record player also including an imformative 9hard back book.The music speaks for it self and has been revued many times by far more articulate people than i,just to reiterate this in my opinion is the motherlode except no substitutes!!"
1,Faulty disk ruins this item,"I looked forward with anticipation to receiving this boxed set. I've been a Ray Charles fan all my life. After receiving the first shipment, boxed in a very interesting and amusing replica of a 45 RPM record player from the fifties, I started listening to the disks in order. Disk 8 would not play. Tried it in three different players. Wouldn't work. So I arranged to receive a second shipment. Started playing each disk. Disk 8 wouldn't play. I've returned both sets and requested a refund. Too bad!"
3,Pipes,"A collection of technically superb if somewhat passionless performances of Mozart's finest arias by one of the great voices of our time. The mastering is a bit low, so I find myself turning the volume wayyyyyy up to hear Bartoli's more delicate moments."
5,Dora is a hit with my little explorer,"I wasn't sure I was going to be able to get my daughter to wear a helmet for skiing, but the Dora helmet was an instant hit. She wanted to put it on right away. The adjustments for size are easy to make and this helmet should last us for a couple of years. (Hopefully she doesn't grow out of Dora first.) I have the Giro Richochet helmet for two of my kids and am pleased with them as they are adjustable for a snug fit. I also have a Boeri for my other son which seems very well made, but it is not adjustable."
5,Great helmet for a 2 year old,"We live in Breckenridge and needed a good helmet for our 2 year old son. None of the helmets I saw online said they were for his age. I ordered the xs-sm in this helmet and it fits great. He has an averaged size 2 year old head, not big or small. I expect the helmet will fit for another year or two. It is light and comfortable. He LOVES wearing it. We use it for skiing and sledding and he will sometimes just wear it around the house. I ordered the Giro Chico Goggle to go with the helmet and they work great."
2,Sometimes things just aren't that great,"The book itself is perfect for the game, but the condition of this book stinks. I received it and when i opened it up, the pages just started falling out. Something was wrong with the binding so now i hold it together with clips so I can continue my game."
3,wrong but still good.,"i wanted this and it had said for gamecube. but when i got it, it was the PS2 version, but its still a really good guide."
5,my son loves the book i bought for his game,i bought the book for my son for his game and he was most happy to get the book you delivered it is the fastest time allowed and he was very impressed with it and got right back in the game with the book to help me more with the game. you made him happy so i am very much happy thank you for all the help in making my son happy :) i have used [...] for my books before and i will use them again in the future thank you again
4,Tony Smallz is on Fire,"This is MC Eiht's best release since ""In my Neighborhood"" Great beats,and good lyrics. Hot songs are ""Do Compton"" ""My Nine"" ""Get at Me"" ""8 Seconds"" etc, alot of good tracks on this album, any mc eiht fan should definitely go pick this up. The hottest track on this album in my opinion is ""When I Go"""
3,"Instead of hating this one, try the excellent remake","None of the reviewers below, who rightly scorn the 1970 Solti Mahler Fifth for its garish, overly bright sonics, has mentioned that there is a remedy. Solti remade the Mahler Fifth in gorgeous sound under live concert conditions in Veinna. That recording, also on Decca (# 433 329), is from 1990--it features Solti on the cover standing against a stormy sky.It's also a less driven reading. Solti's Mahler became more natural and easy (at least for him) toward the end of his career. He isn't a sentimentalist by any means, but if you crave the CSO at its stupendous best, the remake is a real thrill."
1,ONly Urdu script and English Translation: Useless unless you can read Urdu,"I bought this thinking it was a ""transliteration"" based on one of the reviews. WEll, I guess I need to be more careful about assuming people know what they are talking about. THis book has only the Urdu script and ENglish translatiion, which is rather uninspiring. PLus, if you could read (and presumably understand) the Urdu, why would one need the translation anyways?Not recommended for most people seeking to explore Urdu poetry."
5,This album will open your heart to our mother the Earth,"The more I listen, the more I understand the oneness that our brothers, the Native Americans, had with the Earth. My heart opens with the sweet pain of longing for the way it was and can be again. There is so much to learn from each other. How can we waste time doing anything else but receiving the Light and Love from everyone? If this album doesn't send you into higher dimensions, then you don't want to go there."
1,This group had me fooled.,"This group had me fooled. Not even a Native American, Falsely portrying the first peoples."
2,Weird techno effects,"This album has a background with too many techno-derived synthesizer effects to get me in tune with nature. There are overlaid traditional singing tracks - but it doesn't credit the singers! Take away the singing and chanting, and it sounds like a disco fashion show runway soundtrack!"
2,Works but it's seems jury-rigged,"I am a bit suprised and disappointed at this product. I fits but lacks a solid, air tight connection. This is supposed to be for a Eureka vacuum but it plugs into the existing hose and is a very sloppy fit. When I turn on the vacuum, the connection becomes tight by suction but becomes loose when I turn off the power. Then debris falls out of the junction when I pull them apart. Also, the hose is made of really cheap hard plastic and has a mind of it's own. I thought this was made by and for the Eureka upright vacuum."
2,Cheap but works,"The hose itself is cheap plastic, not like the vacuum hose. However it works. Not anyones fault except the manufacturer."
4,Expressive Paintings,"I have enjoyed this book for many years and take it along with me when I go on a painting trip. I enjoy the expressive styles, paint applications, and use of color."
5,California Impresssionism,The book was in excellent condition (new) and was available for less than half the price of the book in the museum bookstores. It has good color reproductions and interesting companion text.
5,This is one deep canyon,"If ever a recording was made that demonstrated the ability to reproduce a certain quality of sound this is one of them. I never fail to be impressed by the capture of the sound of the DSO in this ""Grand Canyon"". I think it way ahead of the competition in evoking the vastness of the scene. You need a good speaker system to do justice to it. The Porgy and Bess"" is excellent; here is a big orchestra that knows how to count and so they sound perfectly at home with the music. I cringe when I hear an orchestra of hundreds playing something with a heavy handed drummer leading them on. All in all, a great recording!."
4,Grofe,"Have mixed feelings over this one. Technically the recording is excellent (DDD) but I always wonder why mix a Grofe recording with Gershwin. Maybe it's because they start with ""G"". A much better redition is Angel's ""Great American Grofe"" with all Grofe cuts although recorded originally in the mid '50s."
4,good spark plugs,"The quality of the entire plug is excellent, the price is not.I feel a little powerless the engine, i don't know if is because the spark plugs have a ""R"" resistor inside to minimize the ""EM"" :("
1,Good product. Bad service.,I ordered two sets of these dishes and expected to receive a total of 12 dishes. Instead they sent two dishes saying the description was in error and the price was for each dish not a set of six. I feel they should have either honored the description or contacted me before sending only two. The dishes are actually quite nice and appear to be good quality. That was two weeks ago and it appears the description of quantify has not been changed.Update 11/19/10. Comments above dealt with dishes offered by Ace Hardware Outlet through Amazon. The description has changed and now Amazon is offering the product in a set of six. So ignore the above comments unless you're considering buying from Ace Hardware Outlet. The dishes really are quite nice.
3,Not what I expected,I'll admit I didn't pay enough attention to what I was ordering - when a CD says import make sure you realize where it's coming from. I merely had a name to go by and ran with it. It is beautiful music and the women singing have great voices; the problem? I can't understand japanese. I had no idea that the words to a song add as much as they do but I know now.
3,Adorable but sheds,Adorable puppet. Quite lifelike. Had to get rid of it eventually though as it shed continuously.
1,Skip it,"Beyond reasonable doubt, JL was paid by the word. The best way to read this book is to read the first part and go straight to part five. Don't worry, nothing happens in between but repeating the same arguments in various places over and over. Besides, the plot is artificial and the characters are particularly dumb. For instance, DH wakes up only in part five to follow a track any cop or any efficient lawyer would have followed right away... And all solves by itself. Believe me, there is more action in a chapter by Clancy or by Grisham than in this 600-page book."
1,Have some Mercy on me and dont read this book....,"Three words: Boring Boring BoringThe last time I saw so much fluff, he was caddying for Tiger Woods. This book was miserable. I'd rather read a phone book."
2,Disappointed,"As a fan of John Lescroart's previous works I read The Mercy Rule with great anticipation. This book had great potential--an interesting and intruiging story line, engagable characters, and a great geographical setting--however, it disappoints almost from the beginning. I kept reading hoping it would get better but unfortunately it did not. This book lacked the energy and spirit of Lescroart's previous works. I kept reading the book ever hopeful that the writing of the real Lescroart would surface--unfortunately it did not."
2,This is my least favorite of this author's books.,"I started with ""13th Juror"" upon a recommendation from a friend. Was hooked - went back and read the prequels, have read all the sequels, and everything else this author has written. This one has been hard to get through. I hardly recognize Dismas. Graham isn't really all that likeable either. I really don't feel like I know the character. Sal is the best developed. If this is the first Lescroart you've read you may find it okay. But - go back and pick up another. This isn't his best work by a long shot."
1,"Boring, Predictable, forced my way through it!",This was my first read by this author and most likely my last. I thought the storyline had great potential; what happened? The characters were poorly developed. Absolutely nothing you could sink your teeth into. Boooo hoooo.
1,Disappointing,"This could have been a good story, the premise was an interesting one. But the whole book was padded with way too much non-essential information. It actually occurred to me that Lescroart was being paid by the word...then it would all make sense. For the most part, a very dull read."
4,The Mercy Rule,"Dismas Hardy, at his best. A regular guy, working hard at his craft, to support his family. The usual Abe Glinsky, Frannie, children and cast of characters. Deep development of the victim, the accused, policemen, politicians and dysfunctional, families. Was it murder or mercy? A question, we may all, at some point, have to answer. Excellent courtroom drama."
4,Well written.,"This is my first by Lescroart, and I found it to be well-written and easy to follow. The book is based on the issue of assisted suicide, and whether or not Graham Russo helped his father kill himself. The medical examiner's official standing is that it is a homicide/suicide equivocal -- which means that it could be either, there is not way to tell, and no indicators to make him lean one way or the other. This book addresses one of the medical issues that is at the forefront of today's society, but it does it in a way that is subtle and not in your face. Throughout the book, Graham Russo maintains his innocence, thus sending Hardy on a search for the truth leading him to unearth a secret almost twenty years old."
3,"Some keepers, some snoozers","A lot of songs for the price. Many I didn't recognize as I am much younger than probably most of the McGuire Sisters' fan base. So I thought I'd give these unfamiliar songs a try. I used to have ""Just for Old Time's Sake"" on vinyl. I loved every song on that album. To my displeasure there were a lot of schmaltzy snoozers on this album. To my taste they lacked energy. One of my favorite songs 'Volare' is absent from this album as well. There are maybe about 5-7 songs that I bothered to put on a playlist but the rest I don't listen to. I know they have better songs out there. Too bad many were left off of this album."
4,A very nice deck - excellent for the beginner,"I do like this tarot deck. A lot of effort was put into the major arcana cards as they are very well drawn. The colors used are a bit different from most of the decks that I have seen and really seem to suit the cards meaning. The minor arcana cards are nice and are quite different from any that I have seen before. All have rather large numbers on them and the symbol of their suit. There is also a bit of a picture or a artistic background to reflect the mood of the card. Each card is also labeled with the meaning of the card which is good for the beginner, but is perhaps too resticting as a card can have several meanings. It is a very nice deck and is a good addition to anyones collection."
5,"Compelling, insightful, and beautiful.","I have owned this deck for many, many years. After purchasing and trying out numerous other decks, I seem to always return to this one. A tarot deck must speak to the reader, and this one speaks to my heart and always has something fascinating and new to tell me. The drawings are rich and multilayered, crossing boundaries of ethnicity and gender, but such authenticity seems to have been channeled through the author almost subconsciously, as it appears natural rather than intentional and forced. The colors in this deck are extensive and well utilized, ranging from pastels to primary colors. The cards are sturdy and a pleasing, practical size. Although based on the Tree of Life, they are easily adapted to any style of use as well as a wide range of spreads. I recommend this deck highly, and hope it will become a treasured companion on your life path, as it has been for me."
5,Gets 5 stars for descriptive artwork!!!!!,"You don't even need the book, the art work and captions get you started and the rest of the reading is easy. My favorite deck so far."
1,Perfumania Unresponsive,"Romance by Ralph Lauren is a nice fragrance. In fact my wife has a bottle and I didn't know it. When I tried to arrange for a return authorization with Perfumania, (on several occasions)they simply didn't respond.Additionally, they charge a 20% restocking fee which is totally out of line.I would strongly suggest you buy your fragrances elsewhere."
1,seller sent a different product!!,"Seller sent a different product - not the combo DVD I ordered. I didn't open it right away, but was very upset when I did! Livid!!!"
5,LOVE LIGHT SHINES!,"I have been a fan of Claire Lynch for years, and have seen her and the Front Porch String Band in concert many times. LOVE LIGHT is my favorite so far. I never take it out of the CD changer. Claire has always had a unique perspective on the bluegrass genre that she calls home. Her incredible vocal talents show that she can sing anything, and shouldn't be limited to bluegrass. And yet she remains true to it, while always spreading her wings to pure country, like ""I Don't Have To Dream."" As she showed on MOONILIGHTER, with ""My Heart is a Diamond,"" she is as at home with country as she is with bluegrass. I really think she could be a bigger country star if she didn't remain so closely identified with bluegrass. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE BLUEGRASS, but I think some of it's biggest stars are known simply as bluegrass stars. Check out LOVE LIGHT, you won't be disappointed. If you like it, try MOONLIGHTER, you'll like it, too."
3,I hate to do it but....,"I didn't think this was one of the best of Claire Lynch's CD's that I have heard. After buying ""Friends for a Lifetime"", I just knew I'd love this one. Well I don't. I just feel some of the cuts were not indicative of true bluegrass. I love the two back to back cuts, Bluewater and Savannah, however. Claire's singing is as strong as usual. I'm going to keep giving it a try."
2,Okay,"Claire Lynch has a nice voice and nice background music. Unfortunately too many of her songs have that ""Cole Porter"" sound and feel. Many of her songs have the Cole Porter sound, touch, and general tune...which is quite irritating since it reminds me of the Lawrence Welk Show and Big Band Era, which I am a little tired of. Country and Big Band (Cole Porter) just don't go together. Almost all of her songs have that Cole Porter sound...which gets damn well annoying after a while. By the way, a light drum would be pretty rather than just a drab guitar. Give me a break...Claire Lynch is trying to give Cole Porter a ""Redneck"" sound...no way in hell that's going to work out. The songs ""Stranger things have happened"" is almost 100% a Cole Porter song with the Redneck voice of Claire Lynch...my goodness, this does not work out (and sounds awful). Claire...please stick to country!"
4,"Finally, an iPod case with a screen protector!","This is a very nice iPod case. I'm not sure if it's compatible with the dock (because I don't have one), but it DOES have a thin silicone cover on the iPod screen! It leaves the top and the area around the port at the bottom uncovered. It's a little difficult to get on, but there isn't really a need to get it back off so that's not an issue. The clickwheel remains unobstructed and your iPod is happy and scratch-free!"
4,Great Case,"It was pretty simple to get on, its got a great no slip grip to it. Its a very cute color, and the screen protector is awesome. It took me forever to find a case with a screen cover, because my Ipod after only a few days of using it was getting all scratched...i definetly reccomend it to all who are looking for a cover"
5,Mr. Bean,"Dear Mr.BeanYour such a funny person. I cant believe you really do all those things in your life like taking out your bugger in public, then losing your diary writing a reward page and then somebody finds it and you dont give the person the reward and avoiding him,oh and Mr.Bean your really nasty putting a bug on your diary.Overall I read your diary and its great so real like. ok bye thanks for reading.Sincerely,The SilentCat"
2,Defective,The coat sleeve was sewn shut so my daughter was not able to even play with it. I would have tried to exchange it but I purchased the item several months in advanced and did not open the package to inspect it.
5,Just what I was looking for,I needed this for another person and looked in every store i could but couldn't find it so I had to go on computer to find it. I was lucky to get it and person it was for was so surprised and loved it.
3,Great Overall Design: Mediocre Plans,"The overall design of this Morris chair is great. Classical lines, robust dimensions, a fun chair to build. However the plans are a lazy. Key information is such as tenon size are missing. The plans come on one poster-size sheet showing the assembled chair from several angles. There is no exploded view and critical measurements are not shown. The booklet of instructions spends far too much time on three techniques and skips step-by-step details that a novice or intermediate woodworker needs. I also purchased plans from Fine Woodworking. They are much better, but, in my opinion the overall appearance of this chair is superior. These plans are good for an experienced woodworker looking for a sharp Morris chair."
1,Don't Buy This For the Armoire,"This Barbie is very pretty but I didn't buy the playset for the Barbie. One of the doors on the Armoire always comes off when you try to open or close it (and is not easy to put back on). Also, the rod for the hangers was made slightly too short so that it doesn't actually stay up once you remove all the rubber bands holding everything in place in the package. I managed to superglue the rod in place but the hangers aren't big enough to hold any of Barbie's clothes (although they do work for Kelly items). The only good part is the drawer. It does open and has lots of space."
4,New York Dolls - 'The Glamorous Life: Live' (Big Ear Music),"This thirteen track compilation is actually a collection of cuts from two other compilation releases, 'Seven Day Weekend' and 'Red Patent Leather'. Some are live, some are good sounding demos. Tunes here I dug the most were ""Jet Boy"", ""Who Are The Mystery Girls?"", ""Trash"", the ""Ain't Got No Home / Dizzy Miss Lizzy"" medley and ""Pills"". Would be a nice addition to either a newcomers or even a long time fan's stack of CD's. Good choice."
3,Not enough meat,The monologues in this book are not good enough to stand alone from the context of the play. Neil Simon's work is not very satisfying.
2,Book of Gloom and Doom,"When I was first diagnosed, I immediately bought this book.After scouring through the pages, I just felt overwhelmed, depressed and really despondant.It proved to be somewhat informative (which can also be achieved on-line), but extremely depressing as most ""stories"" were about the down-sides of this disease and not really concluded in any way.Yes, LE is not curable and there ARE downsides, but my success with my treatments have led me to a very positive place in the management of my care.I have not picked up this book since the last day that I read it other than to look at the diagrams of the lymphatic system."
2,Better without it,"It had very little new info in it--You can get as much on the websites--well written, but not worth it."
3,book,"this was a gift for another woman that suffers from this disease, whe says that it is very informative and accurate."
4,Great Bottle,"I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems."
1,Eh!,"My daughter hated these. They gave her horrible gas! She was gas free with Dr. Brown and Playtex but as soon as I used on of these, she was screaming and her stomach sounded like there was a thunderstorm in her belly. I tossed them away."
1,drenched baby,"I bought these bottles thinking my son could hold them better because they are wide, but the nipple pushes into the bottle over half the time and soaks my son no matter how tight you put on the lid. don't recommend anyone buy these!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these bottles thinking that since my daughter likes her soothie pacifier, then this would be a good transition bottle from breast to bottle. WRONG!!! She hated these bottles. I would put the pacifier in her mouth and then try to get her to take the bottle and she would scream bloody murder. I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us. The only bottle she would take was the Playtex bottles with the big nipples that she could grasp good with her mouth."
5,A Must,ISAAC HAYES Has Been A MUSICAL GENIUS FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.This Collection ReflectsThe Many Styles&Arrangements That Isaac Hayes Achieves Well here.His Music is Timeless&Alot Of Quality Here.He is A GREAT ALL AROUND ARTIST.
3,Limited usability,"I have tried this Book Light with a hard cover book that measures 6x9.2 in. The light is bright enough at the top and in the middle of the book, but near the end of the page the brightness is very poor.If you want to use it for smaller (pocket sizie) books than it's ok. Otherwise, look for something better."
1,"Big, Big, BIG Bag","The measurements don't do it justice; it's huge. It's more of a carry-on piece of luggage (it may be oversized for that). I could get my toddler in there with toys, diapers, wipes and lunch. I am a college professor and needed something to take my class materials home to correct; even legal size papers would go in with room to spare.While well-stitched, the leather is poor as well. It's not a rich brown, but a pale brown, some orange-y brown and some yellow-y brown which make it look cheap. A leather piece should be consistently colored. The fake gold clasp and zippers further cheapen the look.So, considering it's oversized proportions and patchwork leather, I am sending it back. If you don't care about the color and just need something really big for weekend trips or something, this bag would be okay. Don't buy it for a briefcase replacement."
1,Not for beginners,"This book not for beginners . tell me why ?because the authors think All people brains as their brains , it's very complex to difficult to understand .I advise you to buy the book : Learning C# 2005 from oreilly media ."
2,Could have been better!,"As other Nutshell books that i loved, this one is exceptional too. Quick reference to the language features, the detail reference layout for most classes. Precisely there are not many books covering this much info (at least, these days).On the other hand I am not sure how many times I went digging into it and yet couldn't find the classes that I was looking for. Looks like some of the core classes have left out from the classes reference section eg. system.data classes(duh!) and others like remoting, xml.schema, Enterprise, Web... classes (duh! again). Authors could have added more class- reference beef in it (if not released in hurry). Also they should have atleast listed what is the coverage of classes in this reference. I believe the next release of this Reference, would ADD the remaining classes at the soonest( let it go over 1000 pages, atleast it would be a complete desk reference).Overall its a better prompt reference."
3,Not an American Movie,Good movie with an ending that you wouldn't see in America. Leaves you wondering about many things.
3,Rick Steve's Avanti Rolling Tote,"I purchased this bag because of the product description, which contains the following statement: ""The Avanti Rolling Tote is an ideal under-the-seat bag for everything you want within easy reach during your flight, including your laptop"". The only thing true about the statement is that there is room for a laptop. The bag does NOT fit under the seat (two major carriers). Therefore I had to place it in the overhead where it is not convenient during the flight. I'm truly disappointed because the bag is useless to me when I fly. I'm going to try to send it back."
3,Too short,Nice video. It got to me in a timely manner. But too short. and $15.00 for that I thought it was too much. I'll be more careful next time . I will pay more attention to the duration of the video.
4,Nice album to listen to.,"I can't believe how bad are the reviews this album got. So many three stars given. Man, the only reason I didn't give this one more stars is because there were only eight songs on it. That was my only hesitation to buy this album, since living in California as a teenager meant you needed to pinch your pennies a little bit. But I got it, and was pleased. The beats were the rugged underground beats that you would love to listen to any underground cat spit over. His lyrics are great, he rhymes so smooth and puts in good words in his flows. This is definitely ten times better than the Grand Opening, where he starts talking about hoes and money, blah blah. Get this for the pure lyrics that Asia spits out. peace"
2,"Straight Up. No cream, No sugar.","I would say that this is a pretty straight forward album. The production is good, the lyrics are good, but it sounds a lot like typical ""Underground"" rap album. Jagged, dissonant beats. Braggadocia. ""I'm the baddest rapper"" type stuff. You've heard it. I've heard it.And unfortunately in my opinion, Planet Asia's delivery is not all that unique. I always found him more appealing as an accent to others. It really is a good thing that he has guest rappers. But I have to wonder if it is because Asia, himself, knows he can't carry a whole album himself. Or even an EP for that matter.All and all, I wish I didn't sound so harsh. It is a good effort in a world of wack albums, and for those who like their hip hop pretty straight ahead (you know, the ""true hip hop heads""...PLEEEASE) may love this album. But I think good is quite a distance from great."
3,just buy the ep,you would be wise to pick up asia's ep instead. Also of interest might be Blackalicious or the Jurassic 5. Not that this album is bad... but it is just not really worth owning. You will probably get tired of it asfter a few listens.
2,"Original, but largely unsuccessful","This band is highly original, playing an unusual blend of metal, goth and jazz, with female vocals. But the music is more original than successful. The band's broad range of stylistic influences is actually their main problem. The music comes across as fragmented and unfocused. The songs, most of which are fairly long, are collections of several disparate themes that are largely unrelated to each other. For instance, heavy metal riffs abruptly segue into jazz piano solos. The result is that this CD does not really sound like a coherent whole. This album could have been better if the band had made more of an effort to homogenize their music."
1,No Power,"This hard drive kit worked for one day before the power died. Now it doesn't turn on. I'm just glad I copied my data off this drive the day I received the kit.Also, the drive wouldn't make a high-speed USB connection. Every time I plugged it in to my new computer I got the ""this could be faster"" message.I recommend that you stay away from this product."
5,jackie,i loved this cd so much.. great music. & the story on the insert is so cute. i listen to it all the time lol
2,Different,If you're looking for this CD to be the same style of all of his others you're in for a disappointment. I own all of his CD's and absolutely love them...except this one. If you like this type of music it's alright but I was disappointed as I like the easy listening type..not the songs of Ireland.
4,Great soundtrack for an amazing movie,"Hand picked music from Tom Waits, Peter Salett, Elliot Smith and hand crafted music from Elmer Bernstein. It's a great compliment to the movie."
5,Preaching to the converted,"If you're here, you must have seen the movie and liked the music. So I'll keep it brief and reassure you that, yes, the music in the film was great -- and the cd is worth it. The Peter Salett tracks are definitely the highlight, but the whole album is terrific. Hurrah for Ed Norton!"
3,The Best Songs,"The best songs on here are the two tunes by Peter Salett (and okay, the Elliott Smith song). I recommend that you go directly to the Peter Salett section and check out his cd ""Heart of Mine"" - yes named after the song in this movie. Then buy it. You won't be sorry."
4,keeping the faith,I loved the movie Keeping the Faith. I did not buy the soundtrack for it until after I saw Peter Sallet in concert. Then I realized that two of his songs were on the soundtrack. This CD is worth the buy just for Heart of Mine and The Way Things Used To Be.
3,For the mathematician,"Despite studying MRI physics as a (neuro)radiologist, lets just say this is for the MIT RF engineer in you or someone who reads Rich Feynman books in the john...It is very calculus based, and is a lovely discourse on all facets of Maxwell's equations, plus many more very practical examples of real life magnetics (dipole-dipole interections, etc).I bought it just to scare the pants off my radiology residents at lecture time."
2,OK charger,"This charger is ok because it is really fast, and the batterys it comes with are great. The only problem is that it has this stupid good battery bad battery detector and will refuse to charge a ""bad"" battery. This is terrible when you have 4 batteries for something that will take 4 batteries and it will only charge 3. It needs a bad battery disable switch. I dont care if its bad or not, I want it charged. It can be tricked by putting the bad battery in something, use it up a little, and put it back in and sometimes it will charge it. Very frustrating. Charging a battery shouldnt be this hard. Works great when you have perfect batteries."
3,Fast charge,"This is really quick charge, about 15 minutes. But you will waste alot of good batteries on this. Will kill batteries after couple weeks and won't charge. You will need a more advanced charger to revive them."
2,Not Good,"I have used this for over an year.Will charge only few batteries, not even the ones that came with it."
2,Trouble with this charger,I got this new and it would refuse to charge the 4 batteries that came with it. Looks like it is very picky about what it can charge and not charge.
5,Get ready for Christmas with Stewart's book,"Now there's a book out that helps us saturate our hearts in the real meaning of Christmas. After completing the November study and the December devotions in Preparing My Heart for Advent, you'll have a fresh appreciation of the meaning of Christmas. Then when someone asks, ""Are you ready for Christmas?"" you can reply with a resoundingy yes! Not because all your holiday plans and gifts are tied up in shiny ribbons, but because your heart is ready to welcome the newborn King. This is a book to reread each November and December. It would make a great gift for others, too. Let's get the buzz going about this wonderful resource that helps us prepare to celebrate a birth unlike any other."
2,1930's vintage classic,"The Master Blaster who has been copied by all modern authors of Sales books.Having read a wide range of authors from Dan Kennedy, Gitomer, Joe Girard, Joe Sugarman, Jay Abraham, Godin Seth, Drayton Bird et all..Elmer Wheeler's ideas cuts through them all. Written in 1930s, every word is worth's Gold. The only other book you need to read is the one by Robert Collier. These two books are all you ever need. Coomon Sense which you and I can use every day and see results..."
5,Glory In Death,Another great book in this series. The characters hold your interest and the story line in complicated and interesting. I would reccomend this book to anyone.
2,not very good...,"i tried to read this for an hour. i've read several outlines on daniel. dry, wordy and i'm sorry, harshly recieved."
2,False Title,"If you are looking for an autobiography about Columbus, great documentary. If you are actually wanting to learn about America BEFORE Columbus, don't waste your money."
3,Diappointing,"I chose this DVD because I love ancient history. And while this was a somewhat interesting documentary, it was about the native plant life verses European imported plant life. It was not about the human so much and that's what I wanted."
3,"Good Job, but not overwhelming","Worthy addition to any library, but would not make it my sole piece on the subject. I like the Guns, Germs and Steel piece a little better."
2,The target audience for this book is NOT advanced users,"The book itself is OK for beginners or average users. A lot of content in the book is redundant with the online documentation or simply obvious and things like how to launch the registry editor to make a change are explained OVER and OVER again. Once is enough! Hardly for advanced users. Some undocumented registry keys are mentioned, but those can be also found by a quick search on the internet. Screenshots are outdated with beta-version content and some other documentation is outright wrong because it got changed in major ways between the time the book has been written and Windows 2000 got finally released. The book is a typical example of ""take a lot of screenshots and fill the book with lots of redundant help available elsewhere, put here and there some new and good content and make it appear a big deal. Advanced NT folks will be rather disappointed."
3,Deeply hidden secret,"The book itself is fine. Ironically, the CD included cannot be read by my Windows 2000 system and there is no information in the book regarding this problem and nowhere to go for needed help."
3,No secrets.,"Windows 2000 has lots of secrets, but this book (unlike the first ""Secrets"" books) describes few of them. It is close to what the manual should be."
2,Not Very Good,"This book was a real disappointment. After purchasing and enjoying the Windows 95 Secrets, Windows 98 Secrets, and More Windows 98 Secrets books; I recently purchased the Windows 2000 Secrets and found it to be seriously lacking.It's strange; the Windows ME Secrets book was great! This book lacks heart. Its a drab, dull, superficial look at Windows 2000. Just about any Windows 2000 book would be better than this one.Its hard to believe the same guy who wrote all those great books is actually responsible for this miserable work. Must have been a bad day."
2,More a How To Book,"This is a Windows 2000 ""How To"" book. If you are looking for a book about Windows 2000 ""Secrets"" then don't waste your money. This book does a mediocre job of walking you through using Windows 2000, and the ""Secrets"" are few and far between... and some are not ever secrets at all.If you are looking for a how to book, buy one of Microsoft's books, they're much better at this.Very disappointed. Kind of feel like I got hit with a bait and switch."
4,Correct installation of e-book not provided,"When the e-book is installed on the hard disk for use without the CD-ROM, the Search function will not work until the book has been accessed from the CD-ROM _and_ the data has been indexed."
5,My Daughter is 12 and it is still her favorite book!,"My aunt gave a copy of Yummers to my daughter when she was a toddler along with some other books. I was curious when I noticed the copyright was 1973! It was older than I was! We both laughed at Emily's insatiable appetite!Well, it instantly became her favorite, and it still is! She loves the book so much I had to start inventing my own ""Emily and Eugene"" stories to recite to her before bed. I just decided to go online and do a search of James Marshall to see if he wrote anything else. I find it so cute and touching that my almost teenage, Harry Potter, Twilight loving daughter still finds happiness and comfort in our bedtime ritual with Emily and Eugene. :)"
5,Mother loved it,Bought this at the request of and for my mother. She loves this scent and was thrilled with the gift.
1,Department store muzak,This is like hearing something strangely familiar at the supermarket and realizing: ARGH! That is a muzak version of GnR! Blech!Avoid this.
1,Really only for OCD collectors...,If you love the guitar sounds you hear with Guns N' Roses... You'll hate this CD. No one plays with the same inflection as Slash & Izzy. This is really only for people who have to have every tribute album they see... just to have it.
3,Good Information - Not Well Organized,This book provides some great information about many of southern California's beach dives. The authors are experts on diving in California. The biggest problem I find is that the information is not very well organized. It is rather difficult to find the pertinent and important dive site information.
3,"Great album, not so great CD issue","This CD was made from a record. I am always quite annoyed when I purchase a CD that is made from a record. Unless that is the only source available, there is no excuse to do so. And I also find it to be false advertising to sell a CD sourced from a record with no indication. If I knew this was sourced from the record, I would have went and found my own vinyl copy and made my own CD, since there appears to be no one in the industry that is capable of doing a better job of it than me, which is quite sad given that I don't have the professional equipment that is available to the professionals."
5,Beautiful Strings Everywhere!!,"This CD has strings galore. You'll never hear strings sound so beautiful as on this particular recording of Strauss waltzes. Mantovani and his orchestra have achieved something quite special and lovely. The waltzes have an added lightness to them. Instead of heavy sluggish playing by the strings, you hear a bouncy sheer beauty in the string section---truly the gem of this CD. These pieces were recorded in the late 50's but sound magnificent. The sound that London/Decca was able to create back then was astounding. Highlights (personal favorites) on this disc are of course the Blue Danube, Emporer Waltz, and Du und Du. On top of the great sound, playing, and conducting, you'll get this CD at a bargain basement price."
5,Excellent Classic,The sound quality is out of this world!! you just want to get on the floor and dance!!
2,non bellissima interpetazione,"gusti personali, certo, ma non mi ha fatto impazzire l'interpretazione. preferisco le interpretazioni piu' classiche, ad esempio, per capirci, ""sul bel Danubio blu"" che si ascolta nel celeberrimo ""2001"""
2,Strass Waltzes,The jewel case was cracked. Could not replace because it was a Christmas gift. Very disappointed that the packaging was bad.
5,My favorite translation of the Gospel of Thomas,"I think the translation flows very well. Only a scant few lines of the translation didnt flow well or didnt resonate properly.I've read some other translations and just got an ugly feeling from them, like outside agendas or beliefs were leaking into their translation.I believe the Gospel of Thomas to be a true written account from one of the Apostles of Christ."
4,"very informative, prepared us for owning a flatcoat.",this book has lots of good information that pertains exclusively to flatcoats. highly recommend if someone is considering to have a flatcoat run their household and be a part of their lives.
5,World's Greatest Working Trucks.. The best of Colorado,"One of my faves. Not just because the cover and the inside pages happen to have some sharp W900A extended hood Kenworths in all their glory.Peterbilt also features heavily in this edition and the book could have easily been entitled ""Kenworth and Peterbilt in Colorado"" because there is precious little of any other makes on these 96 glossy color pages.Oh well, you can't help bad luck!Stunning photography, great backdrops and interesting text to boot. An absolute must-have for classic long-hood Kenworth and Peterbilt fans. Enjoy!"
3,"Beautiful product, but not practical","I absolutely loved the quality of this product and the fact that my purchase was also aiding the artisans producing it. My only complaint was that the interior pockets were not large enough to hold ID and other cards. With regret I had to return the item. For those who need only to carry cash, it's a fantastic purchase."
1,"Poor quality, poor customer service","As comfortable as this recliner was, it lasted less than two years. The eyelets for the rope started rusting shortly after I got it, then after about a year the frame started falling apart. I contacted customer service (the manufacturer, not Target's, because it was three months after the 1 yr warranty) but they wanted me to ship it to them at my own cost for repair. That would have cost more than the price to begin with. So I finally just threw it out -- after 1.5 years and barely using it, keeping it folded and covered when not in use. I only weigh 139 lbs, so my weight certainly didn't contribute to the deterioration of this chair. What a disappointment this product turned out to be."
5,Relax,This was such a lovely recliner that my daughter bought a second one for me for friends to sit in!
4,Great book,"I thought this was a great book. Its a good story and Rawn's story-telling is very straight forward. My two complaints however, are that the plot got convoluted (someone else's review said the same thing) and that the similar character names can get very confusing. Example: Sioned, Siolnell, Sioneva. There are so many characters that I often had to go back and review the last thing they had done (sometimes dozens if not a hundred pages previous). But, my complaints are minor next to the great story told in this book."
4,Compelling!,"This is the second series of Melanie Rawn's that I have read and found it superb. Although I found the beginning difficult since I have not read the first series, once established in my mind it fell into place perfectly. Complex characters, with family connections intertwined made it seem more real for a family of nobility. I enjoyed the short pieces through various character's eyes, it made the story feel more full. An excellent read that I look forward to the next book with great eagerness."
4,way better than the dragon prince series,this series was way better than the first series. at least this one went faster. i just don't know why melonie rawn insists on putting in so much superfluice details. i don't want to know everybody's moral delemas. i just want some escapism.
2,too many characters,"Hmm im one of those who have not read the dragon prince and went straight to dragon star. Maybe this was why i found the book rather confusing as the characters were not introduced formally and i felt like i was stepping halfway in. ANyway, even if i had not read the previous trilogy, the book still should have a central point of view."
3,Disappointing Follow-up but Still Worth the Read,"The Dragon Prince series, which gave birth to the Dragon Star series, is far superior to its predecessor. Reason? Like the novels, the son can not hold a candle to the father.While Rohan and Sioned, the protagonists binding the first three boks together, captivated and enchanted readers, Pol simply does not hold the following series together. There is a bit too much tragedy for any reader to swallow in such large chunks. Pol's personality, while interestingly different from his father's, is SO determined to be different that he's a tad hard to believe. Many favorite characters seem to drown him out; newer characters never quite develop.Readers of the first series should follow up with the second. The books aren't precisely bad. They are, however, a bit disappointing. It all feels like Rawn is trying too hard to be different in the next installment."
1,Don't even think about reading this book.....,"...unless you have read the previous trilogy. At least, I can but hope that helps it. Amid unpronouncable names, vague references to dragons that are smarter than the people and serve no purpose, characters with weird powers that are never explained,and some of the most convoluted family trees I've ever read, lies no plot, no reasoning, no explanations, no nothing. Some people are attacked by an enemy that comes out of nowhere, which is never explained as to who they might be, where they came from, or why they came in the first place. The people fight and run, fight and run. It is undoubtably one of the worst books I've ever read. I don't even have a desire to read the first trilogy to try to figure everything out. I was terribly disappointed. I certainly will not pick up another of this author's books."
5,Ashkenazy = Amazing,"These are great performances. Ashkenazy uses subtlety and strict adherence to the score rather than saccharine, ridiculously swooning rubato. Now, some people prefer the opposite. But they tend to be overly emotional. And strong, frenetic emotion doesn't equal profound controlled emotion. Ashkenazy is more about the music itself, in my opinion."
5,Excellent cup of tea,"This cup makes excellent tea, I prefer the glass filter over stainless steel for some reason. I do get some BOP tea leaves stuck in the holes, but nothing a quick brush with the toothbrush can't handle.."
4,I love it,Like many others the first one i ordered was brokenbut amazon sent me another one so it's all good.it's a great tea cup. steeps well and cools off fast enough so i can actually drink my tea.
1,Infuser arrived broken- partial refund,"Unpleasant experience! The infuser arrived broken. Only received partial refund. This product is not properly packaged for shipment.I bought a glass tea infuser at Adagio.com, and had a more pleasant shopping experience."
1,"A nice idea,....but poorly executed","Despite all the high tone reviews about its ""modern design"" ""borosilicate"" glass (woop dee doo!) Bodum's European design awards and long history, I came away unimpressed with this ""tea pot"".Using fine quality whole leaf tea DOES result in some of the leaf matter getting stuck in the small drain slits at the bottom of the infuser. The other flaw was the loose ""rattly"" lid that is just poorly fitting. You will know immediately that this product is not up to snuff the second you pick it up and notice how thin and flimsy the glass is. It's a cheap piece of glass just waiting for an accident to happen on a slippery/wet kitchen counter, or from one good swoosh of kitty's tail to send it smashing all over the floor.As one reviewer said of another of this company's teapots, ""I expected more from Bodum"""
2,"Great Idea, but breaks far too easily","This is a great product...until it breaks. The glass is very very thin. While it may be boro-silicate glass, the infuser part of it has slits that weaken the whole structure. I've had two of these, and the infusers last about a week before the slits in the infuser turn into cracks that spider through the whole thing until it breaks in half. Nice idea but the execution leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Works great for me,"I think this product is very well designed, it's simple and it works. On some of my cheaper teas ""not all the leaves are whole"" I was frustrated at how the little slits did get clogged with tea leaves. But I found that it was easy enough to clean with a business card, by running it through the slits.Best thing is now I can enjoy my tea at work one cup at a time!"
3,Broken Upon Arrival,Never tried item as the infuser was shattered upon arrival. What is going on Amazon?I can tell you that the handle is a little small as the mug was still in one piece. I prefer the Primula handle over the Bodum handle for sure.
4,Nicely designed tea cup,"The infuser is very easy to use. It is nicely designed to avoid making mess when drinking tea. The top is used as a holder for the inner part when you are drinking. The whole set is very easy to clean too. My only complaint is that the glass wall is quite thin and the whole set looks very fragile. In fact, the first set I received was broken during the shipping. But amazon was very fast in sending me the replacement. The cup is very light. It would be better if it is a little bigger."
1,Beware...product was shipped broken...refund only 50%,"I bought their stainless steel infuser, and stainless steel travel mug. Both are great and i still use from 3 months ago. But this thing came broken and refund was only 50%..something about a restocking fee(even though it was shipped broken)...and the refund process took well over a month...can't contact a person a their site...THIS PRODUCT IS CRAP!!!"
1,Poorly Packaged and Broken,The glass interior was wrapped in cardboard and not surprisingly was shattered in transit by the time I received it. I do not recommend this purchase if you do not want to drink glass shards.
2,Cheap,"If drinking tea has any sort of calming-ritual effect for you, you won't want this flimsy, clunky thing. It feels like a disposable plastic cup, and the parts jangle loudly. I only bought it because it was eligible for Amazon Prime; if I had been more patient, I would have ordered another Forlife product, which are consistently good quality."
3,Personal Glass Tea Infuser,"I was looking for cups to go with the Primula Tea Gift Set. This will work, but was not exactly what I was looking for."
3,How to review this,"I cant really review this product fully because I never got a chance to use it. It sounded like something I would like, so it was bought for me as a gift. Only problem is, when it arrived it was broken.So while I cant comment on how well the product does what its supposed to, based on what I did see of it, I can say that it looks very fragile and easily broken. I dont think Id have this in a house full of small children, one wrong move and youd have pieces all over the floor."
2,not bodum's fault,"I should have listened to other reviewers more closely. I, too, received a box of shattered glass from Amazon. I labored over whether or not to leave this feedback and arrived at the fact that its necessary for Amazon to take notice of how they are shipping this particular item. There have been too many of these returned (according to the feedback) due to damage during shipping for me to just sit idle here. Amazon, please modify your method of packaging and insulation for this item. It is not fair to the consumer that nothing has been done to rectify this issue. Thank you for your time and I'm hopeful this is a suggestion you will take seriously."
5,Love it!!,"Boo Hoo, I just broke my barely month old set and am here to buy another...maybe two.I have had no trouble getting any leaf unstuck from the slits after use. A few quick rinses did the trick...any wider and the leaves would end up in the cup, which I just hate.The only design decision I question is why they put a pouring lip on a single user cup. I surely am not going to brew my cup of tea and then pour it into another to drink it, so why have it at all."
4,This book was informative as well as easy to read.,"One of the reasons I ordered this book was that I had only seen the film version of ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" and I had never read any biography of Elizabeth or Robert Browning. I found the book to be informative and readable. It didn't get bogged down with the psychological issues, although there certainly were many involved. The book wasn't stiff and formal, one of the problems I have had with many other biographies. Ms. Markus did an excellent job in following the Brownings through their married life and showing the love and respect they had for each other. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves biographies and who also loves to reach back into the Victorian Era."
4,A Romantic Story,"The romantic story of 2 poets who fell in love at mid-life, married, escaped to Italy, and lived happily for 15 years until Elizabeth's death. The author discusses the lives of the poets amongst their friends, acquaintances, other writers, & artists in Italy where living was less expensive and the climate more favorable. There are many cute stories about their son Pen and how the couple disagreed over various aspects of his unbringing. Also touched upon are the previous generations of both the Barretts and the Brownings and their history in Jamaica. Besides learning about the the Brownings, this book gives you a good feel of what life was like in the middle 19th century. Lots of B&W illustrations throughout the book."
2,"Great love story, Not an easy read.",I bought this book because I wanted to read a biography of the relationship between Barrett and Browning. Their story is amazing but this book was not an easy read. The author jumped around too much and gave too much background detail. I wanted a book that told their love story in a more chronological way. I did however like all the photos of their family and friends. I lost interest halfway through and have yet to finish it.
4,Wonderful book,"This is a great book. Good information. However, the price is outrageous. The price in bookstores was $20 to $30. I paid 19.95 for a new one. Besides, it has not been updated since 1999. I would not pay $188 for this kind of book"
5,The Sacketts,"This is my favorite book and I also liked the movie, They were very different but very good.I wish that it would have been longer."
5,bittersweet,"I loved TAD back in the day. TAD's music was (and still is) one of the pinnacles of hesher metal, in my opinion. Forget grunge, forget heavy metal, forget sludge, TAD kills them all.I was excited to see this documentary, if only to bring back all those memories of the early 90s. As a history of the Seattle 90s grunge scene, it excels. As a history of TAD (and Tad Doyle the man) it excels even further, even though it's heartbreaking to watch Tad recount what could have been, if only TAD's fortune had been a little more favorable. There was setback after setback, dooming TAD to a footnote when they could have been on top of it all. The DVD is a sad thing to watch, if you're a fan."
1,"No first run hits here, all re-records or tributes to days past.","Not a single original song, sang by the original artist. Kenny Rogers' Love Will Turn You Around sang by a nearly 70 year old Tommy Overstreet.Or try listening to a 73 year old Liz Anderson singing the Willie Nelson penned song 'Crazy', popularized by Patsy Cline in 1961. Painful for me anyway as I remember Liz from the late 1960's with her beautiful voice but the passing of four(4) plus decades takes the shimmer off most things. My gosh lets leave these former country stars, now in the 70's and 80's alone.Save your money and get the original songs and recordings of these wonderful artists, in their prime; they were the best."
4,Good but too concise,"A fine book but sometimes too short in many places. I hope it would be expanded to more than 1000 pages in total to cover more details. A good commentary on John should not be less than 1200 pages. But in any way, I am really satisfied with it."
4,Get Carson instead,"I'm preaching through the Gospel of John, and have found that on the chapters so far, D.A. Carson's pillar is much fuller. He goes into a lot more detail.Hope this helps :)"
4,The tree,This is a great little book that describes a book in terms that children can learn from and understand.
4,"Golden Dragon: Crypt of the Vampire, a good read?","Well the answer to my title is yes. This unlike other gamebooks I have read let the player name their character and gave me very open roleplaying decisions. I also like the excitement factor which the author is maintaining constantly. I loved how clever traps were thrown at my character and how I nearly reached failure in some of the traps. The illustrations in Crypt of the Vampire are well done too. The combat system the author uses is very simple and easy to pick up too so this game can be played by not only the seasoned roleplayer. My friend who normally does not roleplay even enjoyed this book. All together, I think that this is a great book which most people seeking a short fantasty trip or many will enjoy. Defintely a book which you should purchase!"
2,Dangerous for young kids,"I read this story to my 3 year old because I remember loving Babar as a child, but I will not read it to her again. The little girl in the story wanders off, accepts rides from strangers, plays in an adult's house all day without her parents knowing where she is, and then when she returns home they all have a good laugh about it. It is at best, teaching a dangerous message to impressionable young kids."
4,Rush to this Album,"Bobby Rush may be one of the hidden secretsof Blues artists today.. He has been around fora while, but only in the last several years hashe come to light for the average fan. Maybe itwas the Blues Channel on XM Radio where I firstheard his voice, but it was a voice that youcan not forget. My library is complete with musicfrom Little Walter, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf,and Junior Parker....and this is the same crowdthat Bobby Rush ran with. Preview ""I'm Gone"" or""Crazy Bout You"" and you will be hooked on BobbyRush.....just like me."
4,Fishing Knots,"Well writen manual , with excellent diagrams and a wide variety of knots needed for most fishing requirements."
2,Very Disappointed,"A few months back, I purchased Practical Fishing Knots by Mark Sosin and Lefty Kreh. Wow, a knot tying book written by two legends in the fishing world. Wow again, I am so disappointed with this book. Find the verbiage and the illustrations to not be helpful at all. Wished I had never made this purchase. Stick with Orvis or another author and save yourself the $13 this book costs. It simply is not an easy book to follow and you can find better ones out there."
1,look elsewhere,"on the surface, the book gives nice illustrations of general knots. the diagrams are clear cut and tying steps seem easy until you actually do it. i've only tried the snell knot so far, which is a basic knot when it comes to fishing. i followed the directions for over four hours and i still cannot get the knot right. call me stupid. i went to google and searched for snell knot tying tips. voila, i got the darn knot under 5 minutes following the google recipe. i cannot comment on the other knot pages since i haven't tried, but having trouble on a basic knot leaves a bad taste already. the upshot is that at least this book gives me new keywords to search for on the internet. i know this is just one bad review but it's surely an honest one."
1,Don't Bother,"Seriously, most remixes are utter crap, and the Junior Vasquez mixes the exact epitome of what I mean: a few scarce samples from original song playing to talentless (and overly lengthened) techno-esque noise. The first JV mix goes to 10 minutes, with just a few pieces of the original vocals spread about; the second, the 'dub', is just a self-indulgent affair that sounds exactly the same as the first, but without any link the original song. Come on!On the other hand, the remix by Danny Saber, while not great, isn't as stifling bad; it appears he actually knows what he's doing, and intended to make a very dancey version of this song.The original is great, but of course why buy this single when you can get the title-track on the actual album, and the Danny Saber remix on the newer edition of the album? I may seem like a hypocrite, seeing as how I bought it, but I'm collecting, so if you don't want to collect everything of Bowie's, don't ever get this."
1,$10? For a 7-page article? REALLY?,"I'm speechless. Would love to read Aslan's experience, but guess I won't. A buck ($!) would have been okay; $2 might have been tolerable."
5,Pond,Absolutely gorgeous book. Highly recommended for our 'nature deficit' children. All of the books in this series are wonderful.
3,Sisley,Hardcover book.............58 pages long..........6 1/2 x 8 1/4 in size. 28 color photos of art work.
4,The Surgeon of Crowthorne,"An incredibly serendipitous account of how the Oxford English Dictionary came to fruition after years of dedicated hard work by an army of voracious readers and lovers of words.Most importantly, Winchester tells the tale of Dr W. C. Minor, a former US Army doctor whom after a series of misfortunate life events, became one of the longest serving inmates at the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane in the English town of Crowthorne, in addition to being one of the Oxford English Dictionary's most prolific contributors.This is a wonderful historical account of the goings-on behind the scenes in the crafting of one of the world's most famous and vital reference books, which was made by the people and for the people."
5,A fascinating read that is both interesting and entertaining.,This little book traces the history of the development of the English Oxford Dictionary. What a dry subject you may think? But no! The commitment and the characters involved in this mammoth task make it a very interesting and fascinating read. Like most others I had thought little about this language of ours and even less about how the words we use were collated into what has become the complete English Oxford Dictionary. What I discovered was an interesting tale of people whose individual circumstances brought them together to complete this mammoth task.
5,The Surgeon of Crowthorne: Could not put it down,"Simon Winchester has taken a potentially dry subject (the creation of the OED) and given us a masterpiece that is not only instructive and informative, but is also a fascinating history and biography of the leading characters involved; sometimes amusing, sometimes tragic, always full of colour. I enjoyed every word of it and was only sorry to reach the last page."
1,More Like How To Maintain Your Metric Cruiser,This book was absolutely a waste of money. There was nothing inside that isn't already covered in a service manual. You would be better off using your money to pay a young person to junk punch you.
5,A Hard Topic Told Wonderfully,"Annabel Greene on the outside has everything - beautiful looks, a career as a model, and a wonderful, caring family. But inside she's hiding a secret that's constantly tearing her apart. And school is no better, where everyone, including her best friend, has turned on her. The new year looks bleak until Owen, the school loner, starts to open up to her and with Owen she feels free to almost say anything. Although the book was incredibly similar to Laurie Halse Anderson's phenomenal novel Speak, there was much more. Dessen delicately touches on many hard subjects in this book, and does it quite wonderfully. She gives each character a purpose and a story and I truly enjoyed that. She didn't just concentrate on Annabel's hard time, but she also told the story of Annabel's sisters, Owen's sister and more. The book is full, hard to forget and very, very good."
4,Great,I absolutely love Sarah Dessen she's so original and great definitely a good book and a nice plot with good quality.
1,Terrible,"This book was just terrible. It is for teenagers only. I do enjoy some Ya novels like the hunger games but there is just not any depth to this book. It was hard to finish. I am sorry I bought a gift set, I hope the other 2 books are not as bad."
3,Descent read,"I would not recommend this book of you are looking for a teen romance novel. Dessen focuses on the main character and the issues in their lives as opposed to the romantic aspect. While there are romantic elements in the story, the relationship is not the primary focus. That being said, if you are looking for an interesting teen novel, this would definitely meet the requirements. Dessen writes a compelling storyline that can resonate with a lot of teenage girls."
5,an amazing teen read!!!,"annabel is beautiful and popular until she has a falling out with sophie. now she worries about her sister, who has an eating disorder and eats lunsh alone on a wall.there is one other peson, owen, who sits by hinself at lunch who annabel becomes friends with. this is an AMAZING!!! book and i would recomend it to anyone"
4,Wonderful,"I love Sarah Dessen and I was very excited for her book to come out. Just Listen was better than I expected it. Although it is a bit slow at times, Just Listen and Sarah Dessen will soon become a favorite of yours."
4,Lovely...,This is the first book I've read from this author. I loved it. Looking forward to reading more of her work.
5,Awesome Book,This book was really amazing. I think all teenagers should read this. Dessen created a character that truly touched my heart. I have read almost all of Dessens books and this one is my favorite.
2,A Bit Unfair...,"I only rated two stars because the book started out soooooo agonizingly slow. I am a HUGE fan of Dessen, don't get me wrong. But I read about the first eighth of the book and learned so little about the character and the plot that I tossed it aside. Dessen's other books do a pretty good job of tossing you into the story and getting you into it quickly, but this one wasn't up to the test."
4,Just Listen,"Annabel Greene is the girl who has everything. Annabel doesn't notice but that's who she plays in the commercial for Kopf's Department Store:top student, popular cheerleader, dazzling prom queen surrounded by friends. In her real life, Annabel is the girl who has nothing:she doesn't have a best friend anymore since her friendship with mean-but-exciting Sophie ended with awful rumors flying, no peace at home while her older sister's eating dissorder preoccuoies the whole family's attention, and no ability to tell anyone what is going on in all this malicious chaos.When Annabel meets Owen Armstrong everything changes- he is intense, obssesed with music, and determined to always tell the truth, no matter what the consequences.Annabel hates confrontation could she find a guy who thrives on it? Couls she explain the night her and Sophie stopped being friends?"
2,Just Listen,"*********THIS HAS SPOLIERS**************The Cover was very interesting so i pick it up and started to read it. when Will Cash came into the picture (or rather the book) i new what her secret was, i knew the end before i even got to chapter 4!If you have ever read the Novel ""Speak"", then this is not worth reading because its basically the same ploit. litterally!I'm Sorry if you disagree with me, and if i ruined the book."
5,Fantastic YA Author,"Sarah Dessen is one of my favorite YA authors! As usual, this book is a wonderful read that any young adult will be able to identify with. Great story, great writing, great everything!"
4,YA Fiction at its Best,"This is one of the better Young Adult books I read this summer. I think it is well written and has characters you really care about. It makes you want to keep reading.I thought it was better than SPEAK in how it handled certain topics. I work at a middle school and I would not hesitate to recommend it to our 8th graders. I also liked the way she worked the music scene into her novel, just as the Texas music scene was worked into ALPHA DOG, which was one of the other YA books I read this summer that I thoroughly enjoyed.Yeah, maybe somewhat predicable, but a good read nonetheless."
5,must read,"If you like books about growing up, friendship, teen girls, and a horrible secret about a party then I would definitely recommend this book. But first let me tell you a little about this book.In the commercials Annabel has everything popularity, friends, boyfriends. That's how it used to be actually. Then there was the party during the summer. At the party everything changed. To make things worse, her sister is hospitalized with an eating disorder that preoccupies the family. When she thinks everything's gone she meets Owen Armstrong. The supposed psycho murder. When she gets to know him she realizes you can't always believe rumors.Everything in this book was memorable. Especially the way she describes everything, from what her sister looked like almost dead on the bathroom floor, to what Owen looked like. I agree with what the book is telling you. That you should not believerumors like she did with Owen and like her friends did about the party."
4,Very Realistic,"This is the third Sarah Dessen book I've read and I was very impressed. It contains morals amd lessons everyone should know, but it wasn't my favorite book. In high school, someone is always excluded from clique and this time we get to hear that person's story. Also, it's very realistic in the sense that we also hear about Annabel's struggling family life and going through being a model. I recommend this obok to everyone especially high school girls."
2,Just Listen,"I would give this one 2.5 stars if I could.This book was okay for me. I've been wanting to read a Sarah Dessen book for a long time and I finally got a hold of one. I do hope that the next book of hers that I read is a little bit better and holds my interest more. With all of that said, the book wasn't bad. It was alittle bit slow and slightly predictable, but a predictable book can be good sometimes. I've definately not lost hope for Dessen though and will be seeking out another of her books to read."
5,"Models, family, and bacon...","Sarah Dessen's latest novel focuses on Annabel, the youngest in her family and the sweet, nice one who avoids confrontation and, ever since becoming best friends with the popular-yet-caustic Sophie, avoids standing up for herself. Her family's attention is centred around her older sister Whitney and her eating disorder, and Annabel's white lies - telling her mom she's fine, not discussing the night when she and Sophie stopped being friends - keep things going smoothly. It's not until she meets Owen Armstrong, another 'outcast' at school who quotes Anger Management phrases at her, that she becomes aware of how often she lies, and more importantly, how often she simply fails to tell the truth. This is a story about a lot of things, from complex family relationships to the world of modeling to the importance of music, but mostly it's the story of one girl finding her voice, and letting people hear the sometimes painful but always true things that she needs to say."
4,Just Listen-,"This book was beautifully written, just as you have read in every other review here. The book was very good. It started out with almost a slow, apathetic tone, but this just ultimately adds to the power of the forth quarter of the book. This book is classic Sarah Dessen, save one area. There was a very depressing lack of chemistry between Annabelle and Owen. Both characters (Annabelle esp.) were very much like other characters from Sarah's books, but the didnt clique together with the perfect intensity as all the other characters always have. This review is coming out more negative than i intended it to because it still was a great book. Chameos by characters from the other novels including wes,macy,remy, dexter and the rest of truth squad were lots of fun"
4,It's Okay,"I wouldn't peg this book as one of Sarah's best. Not at all. The book is okay, but it starts out very ver VERY slow. Things get drawn out way too long for my taste. And it has some slight emo-ness. This would be a good book to read if you want something to make your lie seem a lot better than it is."
4,"Good, Easy Read","I'm a big fan of Sarah Dessen. Just Listen is a good, easy read. Some plot points were predictable, and half the time I was screaming at Annabel but overall this is one of my favorites of Dessen's. She kept me reading to the very end. The character's are well developed and realistic. It is worth the read."
5,for some reason...,this is one of my favorite of Sarah Dessen's novels; I really enjoyed the story and especially the male character Owen; this book really stuck in my head and I find myself thinking about like things that were written I guess; ok just read this book!! :)
3,Implausible cloak and dagger,"I had a tough time getting into Old Boys, and in the end, I was far from satisfied when I'd finished the book. The notion of a bunch of old timers from ""the Outfit"" getting the better of their younger, high-tech counterparts of today seemed like a fine idea for a rollicking game of global espionage. Unfortunately, this premise just never gets off the ground. Instead, the group of retirees goes running around the world and with little explanation, keeps turning over all the bits and pieces required to solve their enigma. And the images of supposedly out-of-practice senior citizens suddenly dodging bullets in the wilds of Central Asia or defeating professional assassins half their age in hand-to-hand combat did not do much to lend credibility to the plot. It's a shame because I couldn't shake the feeling that the author had the talent to do a much better job, but chose to go by the numbers instead."
2,Not my type,Not what I would usually read and did not hold my interest as some books do. I bought it on the off chance I would enjoy it and it wasn't one of my best picks. Worth what I paid for it though.
2,Disappointing,"Almost 30 years ago, McCarry wrote 2 of the best espionage thrillers ever produced, The Tears of Autumn and The Secret Lovers. Following the success of these books, McCarry produced a series of books involving some of the same characters in those books, particularly his hero, the CIA spy Paul Christopher. These later books were generally good but not at the level of Tears or Secret Lovers. McCarry's characterizations became shallower and the plots of his novels increasingly complicated and implausible. Old Boys, his first espionage novel in years, continues the unfortunate tendencies of his later books. The plot is highly implausible and in fact, not developed well. There is a host of characters, few of them developed well. This is a mediocre potboiler from someone who can clearly do better."
1,Dullsville,"Perhaps I'd put too much stock in all the praise I'd seen heaped on Charles McCarry and this book. What a great espionage writer he is, the party line went. Our Le Carré, etc., etc. But this book, which I purchased at full price in hardcover, was so dull and disappointing that I gave up in anger and disinterest not even half way through. McCarry probably has been as good as his admirers say, but in this book, he seems to have switched on the auto-pilot, taken the money, and run. I quickly grew tired of all his fancy brand names - dropped, it appears, as a way to suggest authenticity and insider knowledge - and all the exotic locales he pushes his characters to, as if scouting locations for a movie. I have not given up; I will now try his earlier books, starting with 'Tears of Autumn,' and keep my fingers crossed. I remain hopeful."
2,Not a Very Good Book,"It starts off interestingly enough -- great plot idea, interesting characters, intriquing tradecraft. But, as another reviewer has said, a bunch of old spies -- suddenly endowed with energy and fitness more appropriate to twenty-year-olds -- just start trotting off all over the world, for little apparent reason. The cast of characters is too long. As the plot of this long book unfolds, it slips into unbelieveability. I just skipped the last few chapters -- I no longer gave a darn about how the book ended. I'm quite surprised that others consider McCarry as one of the best espionage thriller authors in the business. I haven't read his other books but if ""Old Boys"" is typical, I doubt that I ever will."
5,It's fun to hear what he thinks of his own strips,"This is the second time Scott Adams has published an annotated guide to some of his better strips; the first was ""Seven Years Of Highly Defective People."" This time, the book is just a straight-through compilation of his favorites over a seven-year period, with his handwritten notes below each one. He comments on everything from what he thinks was funny in a particular strip to reactions he got from them (some confused people, for instance). I always think it's fun to hear the cartoonist talk about his work. But I'm a comic strip geek."
5,"""I feel like commiting random acts of catness...""","This is the best Dilbert Collection I've ever read. Usually, (While Adams does make a lot of gems) you have to comb through his books to find something that just makes you laugh hysterically. With this book, your search can end, and you can lean back and enjoy Dilbert at it's finest, with little, strange, but somehow normal seeming comments by Scott Adams himself underneath each comic. This is truly a masterpiece, and I suggest it to any funny comic fan (including Dilbert), because it will leave you pasting many of these comics on your cubicle and laughing on end."
3,Many Are not funny.,"I enjoyed Scott Adams comments on this collection of less obvious, and often less funny, strips, but by mid-way the comments become repetitious and only rarely improve the strips.I rate the quality of Dilbert compilations by the number I want to copy and post and this volume produced few of these.Jack Layman"
4,Great title,you every wonder why life is the way it is then this title is just one of many example of people living as they are.
1,Waste of money for Dilbert lovers.,"This book is maybe my 10th dilbert book or so. I bought this book to get the ""behind the scenes"" of these cartoons. To that respect, this book is a huge failure. S. Adams (or an elbonian replacement) wrote obvious insights without any meaning or reasoning, like ""anything involving the pope is funny, mostly because of his hut"".Conclusion- If you already have a dilbert shelf, this book is redundant (or downsized)."
4,Worked as described,"This product worked as designed. Someone I know accidently deleted all of the photos on a memory card. Since the Pro Duo memory card does not fit in the USB slot, we purchased the adapter. The adapter fits in the USB slot and worked perfectly. In addition, we downloaded freeware (Zero Assumption Recovery) to recover the deleted images and it worked like a charm. Also, it makes transfers of photos easier from the memory card to the PC."
2,An OK adapter,"Feels cheap but does the job. LED comes on to let you know it's active. Cheaply made, the USB plug moves in and out and has to be held when inserting into computer."
1,Don't buy it.,"It feels like instead of plastic, they used egg shells to produce this reader. It doesn't seem it was made to last. Reads fine memory stick duo pro just fine, though"
1,Do Not Buy....,It clearly notes that this adapter is for memory stick pro/pro duo. It took me a week to get it delivered and what I got is regular SD card reader. I needed it for my Sony Memory stick pro duo. What a waste of time... I hope you don't waste yours...I am returning it.
4,Works well!,I bought this card reader for my borther. He said that this item works very well and he can transfer the data to his laptop wherever he goes.
1,didnt work,I got a Micro SD adapter for my one gig card and the adapter would NOT match up w/ the USB device. They also took 2 days past the delivery date. I'll NOT be buying from them again.
5,TOY SOLDIER FOR MY SOLDIER,"I BOUGHT THIS BOARD GAME FOR MY HUSBAND (ARMY BRANCH) WHILE HE WAS DEPLOYED IN IRAQ. IT WAS A PART OF HIS BIRTHDAY CARE PACKAGE. HE LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT HE REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO OPEN IT, BUT IT HELP PASS SOME TIME WHEN HE AND HIS FELLOW BATTLE BUDDIES HAD NOTHING TO DO."
5,Monopoly for the Troops,The troops are really enjoying these games. Truly appreciate the excellent quality of the merchandise and the fast shipping.
4,Cool toy for army party or the avid collector,"NOt sure my 11 yo son appreciates this for what it is. Bought it for him for his army themed party. I think its VERY cool and detailed and the real army men that were around REALLY thought it was cool. Would buy again, would recommend again."
4,Army Monopoly,Our son is a Lieutenant in the National Guard and always loved Monopoly so we thought he would get a kick out of the combination of what he does for a living and one of his favorite games. We were right! The only issue we had was that the game box was crushed in one of the corners but not so much as it would affect the shape of the game board.
1,Board Piece Incorrect,"My family loves Monopoly and gladly support our troops. That is why I think it's very important for everyone to realize that the piece labeled Bradley Tank is INCORRECT. A Bradley is a Fighting Vehicle not a tank. If Hasbro wants to call the tank something more specific, then label it an Abrams Tank. With Monopoly being a popular game, I hope that Hasbro will correct this very incorrect label. Until they do, I would not recommend buying this as it's flat out wrong."
2,Boring,"I think that Monopoly is a very interesting and excitng game, but this no happen whit this version. if you full fil a propety whit all battle station and one division any player that put your token in that propety will lose the game because is too dificult to have enought money to pay for. If you play whit two player the game is too boring and too long, but if you play whit four player then there wont be enuogth battle satations and there wont be enuogth money. I think that it called MONOTOLY"
2,whats this all about?,"i just want to download that song ""when u think about me"". why the hell do i have to buy the whole damn album just to get the 1 song i like? pathetic. give me a free download of when u think about me. ive looked on google til my hands hurt and my brain hurt from the frustration of not findin the download. i dont even know what the movie was about because i never saw it. was it any good? who knows?! most of these bands are unknown to me and theyre sure not popular."
2,Good points and bad points,"The small and thin size is great for taking with you and/or fitting in your purse or pocket and the touch screen and voice prompts are nice. But... the touch buttons are too complicated the keyboard for typing in the address, numbers and the street are all too small to touch without a stylus or a needle. They are TINY!!! The entire keyboard with all the numbers and letters, is 3/4 of an inch tall (5 rows of characters) by less than 2 inches wide (of 12 to 14 characters). WAY to small and frustrating to type anything without many mistakes. The initial downloading instructions were not detailed enough either. I ended up e-mailing customer service then going through the entire installation process over the phone with tech support for over an hour. I have returned mine and installed an in dash unit at Car Toys for 2K. It was worth it!!"
3,Buy the Salzburg Festival video instead...,"What I love this CD for is Ruth Ziesak's wonderful, very sensitive Pamina and the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. As a fan of Böhm's recording of the Magic Flute with a simply unbeatable Fritz Wunderlich as Tamino, I find Heilmann's performance particularly unsatisfactory; also Jo's Queen of the Night and the Papageno on this disc do not really convince me! What I would warmly recommend instead is the video of the Salzburg Festival performance of Die Zauberflöte from the early nineties with Anton Scharinger (as a brilliant Papageno!) plus Deon van der Walt and Ruth Ziesak (as an absolutely lovable young couple) - which is also accompanied by the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Sir Georg Solti."
3,On the Way,"I liked this noir for the same reason I like to watch high school football and live music - there is so much highly professional media it is refreshing to see something growing, still a bit rough but not bad. Nice to see the noir genre updated with a modern hero with a taste for ancient Asian practice and the setting in old New Orleans is perfect as that old tawdy holy superstitious eternal dame is noir itself. Good plot with some surprises. The casting is excellent with some suitably grey figures and their acting will do. Camera work could be a bit better on the close shots but the realistic, long fight-and-chase scene is very good."
3,Good basic intro to boating,The book covers many subjects but none in any great detail. A good book for beginners like me but it also left me with more questions.
3,General information,"Has basic information about sailing and power boating. Adequate, but I was looking for more on sailing.The Numbers Game"
4,From out of Red Hook,"I received a complimentary copy of From Out of Red Hook as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit dorrancebookstore.com to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team.This book made a great summer read for me. The book had all the elements of what was a Mafia life in Brooklyn. The characters are interesting and have an element of mystery and are described perfectly as the Italian-Americans of their era, but it would've been interesting to know what happened in the time frame from Brooklyn to Manhattan in the second half of the book (maybe the author can make a short story about it ;) ) It was certainly a page turner for me, I couldn't put it down intrigued on what would happen next!I recommend it for those who like to read about mafia like stories and just want to read a good story and go for a good ride with the characters!"
2,There are no good IIS books,You have to buy them all anyway so shut up and just do it. But somebody ought to start using editors (real ones!) and illustrators (lots of them) and present information in more ways than mere regurgitations of the software's HELP section.There has to be something better. Call me when you find it.
3,Nothing Beyond the Surface,"Although this title does cover what it promises to cover with daily administration and configuration, the book never presents more information other than what you could have learned from reading the on-line IIS help file that is provided by Microsoft when you install IIS 5.0. It is nice to have the reference in print and it is very comprehensive in that it does cover the aspects of IIS, from configuring each of the major services (WWW, FTP, SMTP and NNTP), to using the Index Service, SSL, ASP (an introduction to the concept) and adjusting performance. But it never goes deeper than explaining each component of the dialog boxes IIS gives you and the general information needed to understand how the section relates to IIS as a whole.If you're looking for a comprehensive introduction into IIS 5, this is a great place to find it. But If already know the basics, and are looking for something that will help you master IIS 5, you should look elsewhere."
3,Not what I thought,Not very technical. If you're a beginner this book helps get your feet wet. If you any experience with IIS look elsewhere.Byron Gileswww.gilestechgroup.com
1,"Weak. Very, very weak.","Reads like someone took a few of the MS whitepapers, culled out the really useful information but ensured that the basic fluff was left intact, threw it all in a blender set on liquify and regurgitated a steaming load of ""Well, duh!"". Save your money and read the FREE whitepapers Microsoft provides on their site or apply the cost of the book toward purchasing a subscription to MS Technet. I'd have given it ZERO stars but Amazon forces us to be nice. This book's only hope for redemption is that I'll someday get to squash a bug with it."
4,Did what it promised,"While not highly technical, the book delivered on its promise. With no experience, I installed IIS 5.0 on W2k Server and published a website. The whole process took about a day, including reading the book."
1,Useless,"This looks like a re-edited IIS 4 book. A very important new feature for II5, Load Balancing, was mentioned w/o explaination on one page. waste of money."
3,Pleasant read . . .,"A quick, easy read . . . If you like a action-filled fantasy-ish with a strong romance element, this is your book.Evil vs. good -- good wins."
4,Great book!,I thought this was a great book! I love the fact the Lori writes the book in the first person. I felt like I was in the story and not just listening to one. I couldn't put the book down!
2,Jager-Suchers are cool...but this book isn't,"If your addicted to the scifi romance genre you'll probably read this book. The author has released a great tease of a short story and the idea of the jager-suchers is seductive. However...I like a heroine whose strong and realistic, not simpering and brainless. Yet the heroine in this book was a mouthy badass taken just a little too far. Granted she went through a nightmarishly tramatic experience, but she ends up a little to winey and...let's face it, psycho. She has absoilutly no sanctity for life when she has lost her own loved ones. She's kind of a female Van Dam, amusing for a few chapters but soon wearying. She's not interesting enough to be an Anita Blake. Our hero and his counterpart Will are also made to sound like the little women who stay at home. Why can't the man and woman be equal? Plus don't Jager -suchers chase anything else except wolfs?"
5,Possibly the greatest box set of the 90's,"The steep price tag and the fact that the songs are b-sides may turn you off to this but if you like the pumpkins you are doing an injustice to yourself. The ""b-sides"" to one of the greatest albums ever are still better than a majority of the music available out there. As much of a variety as on mellon collie and seemingly organized by musical style there isn't a bad song on here. This is a gift from a band that gives us a 28-song double cd and then the year later a box set with 28 more new songs on it, that is unprecedented, 56 songs in the space of a year, what more could you want?"
5,Awesome Box Set,"In fact some of my favorite Smashing Pumpkins songs are in this box. Said Sadly... The Aeroplane Flies High, Turns Left, Look Right (also the name of the box set), Ugly, Cherry, Mouth of Babes (awesome rock song), God, Clones we're all, My Blue Heaven, and many more."
5,Awesome,"This is absolutely a UNBELIEVABLY good album! This album is a collection of B-sides from one the biggest albums in history - Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. B-sides are songs that were considered not worthy enough to be included on normal releases. However, the recording sessions for Mellon Collie were the best the Pumpkins ever did - making this CD one of the best releases from the Pumpkins. I think its safe to say each and every one of the songs in this box set were not only worhty enough to be on Mellon Collie, but some of them were even worthy as Extended Play singles! There's no doubt about it - this album is a must have!<P"
5,Awes0me CD box set,"I bought this set off ebay really cheap and haven't been able to stop listening to it, I especially like all the cover songs."
3,Their outtakes are not that impressive.,"The songs in this set are the singles from Melon Collie and the left over stuff that did not make it to that album. The singles are good, but the other stuff is just not that impressive. Covers of The Cars, Missing Persons, and Alice Cooper do not help that much. The packaging is very cool for those of us who remember the old 45 carrying cases. The booklet is OK, nothing really fancy. Overall, it just did not impress me that much. If it's the singles you want, get Melon Collie and leave this behind."
5,You'll love every song-pumpkins at their best.,Every song sounds great. You'll play it once and want to play it all over again. I didn't even like Pumpkins until I heard Adore and this was the second album(box set) I heard by them and enjoyed it just as much. It is definitely worth the money. Get it. You won't regret it.
5,Music to send shivers down your spine. Pumpkins RULE!!,"SO MANY new wicked songs along with the most popular Pumpkin singles, what more could us Pumpkin LOVERS want? Beautiful melodies such as 'Pennies'and'The Last Song', catchy rock tunes including 'Mouths of Babes' and 'Marquis in Spades' and the classic 'Aeroplane Flies High' are all part of a set of CD's you will never stop listening to. Even if you have the single hits eg. 1979, Zero,Tonight Tonight, still buy it for the other songs which come after. Billy Corgan has once again brought to us a magical collection of songs straight from Pumpkinland."
5,This is VERY cool,"From the hardcore Rock of Zero to the peace on Thirty-Three, this box set is VERY cool. My personal favorite is Said, Sadly, which is a duet on the Bullet With Butterfly Wings C.D. A great buy."
3,Flying mid-range,"This is an admirable collection of rarities from the Mellon Collie sessions, sure to make any Pumpkinite very happy, though fans not belonging in the obsessed category might want to stick with their better B-sides set Pices Iscariot, as this five disc set tends to cover everything else they ever considered, including mostly stripped down, demo-like takes, many times echoing Corgan's solo work due to his lone input on some tracks. Whenever the throwaway vibe becomes too consistent, the band always manages to throw in just enough interesting material to keep listeners intrigued."
4,Excellent but expensive,"I am a big fan of the Pumpkins, unfortunately, my parents require me to buy my own CDs.Now, if I had enough money, I would get this *excellent* group of CDs.I have gotten some of the songs online, so I can vouch for the excellence. My favorite single is Zero, with Marquis of Spades, Mouth of Babes, and God.And, to heavily contrast, I liked the Thirty-Three single, as well, with the more artsy The Last Song, Aeroplane Flies High, and My Blue Heaven.If you haven't heard many of the Pumpkins' songs, I would not recommend getting it.Myself? As I said before, if I could afford it, I would. But, now, I'll have to stick with mp3s."
4,The fashions...wow!,I enjoy watching Kay Francis not so much for her acting which was good but for her presence and the clothes that she was dressed in. The ending did surpise me. It was good.
1,JUNK!!!,"Avoid this sharpener, it is JUNK!! The first one stopped working, like a gear stripped out. I replaced it thinking it was my fault somehow. Then the second did the same thing in just a few days. I got it replaced with a third, which did the same thing right out of the box after sharpening just a few pencils.Spend your money on another sharpener."
1,"Yes, it is Junk","I have never reviewed a product before, but after this box ate several regular pencils (and took its own sweet time doing so), I decided to see what others thought. I cannot agree more with the other 1 star reviewers - this product is really junk."
1,Pencil DULLER...,Read and heed the NEGATIVE reviews. This device will constantly break the lead making the point worthless. Too bad I didn't look here before buying.
1,It's a dud.,Bought this for home use and it can't even handle use for two elementary kids. Eats pencils. Then it just stopped working. Definitely a dud.
1,junk,"This pencil sharpener is terrible. I bought one from Wal Mart and took it right back. It has so little power it will barely sharpen a pencil. This pencil sharpener is not fit for a child's play room, much less a home office."
1,Buy one of those little pencil bag sharpeners - save your money!,"One of those little single blade dealies that you throw in a pencil bag would be just as effective as this thing! As with the other reviewers, noticed slow motor in just the first few uses. Thought maybe the shaving case was full. First time we removed the front shaving case, pencil shavings spewed all over the room because the receptacle is too small and awkward to remove. Within 5 uses, the pencils were not sharpening evenly. Upon inspection, bad design is to blame. The metal sharpening gear grinds up against plastic and erodes the gears quickly.When I was a kid, my grandparents had a metal sharpener attached to the door frame. You dialed up the size of pencil you wanted to sharpen, stuck the pencil in and cranked away until you had a nice sharp point. How I long for the good old days when sharpening a pencil was easy and darn good fun for a kid! Save your money, do a little research and keep a manual sharpener handy."
1,Bad Design,The thing I don't like about this is the design. When you open the part to take out the pencil shavings it doesn't come out easily. It sticks. It never went smoothly out of there (I tried it about 6 times). So I could just imagine trying to keep the pencil shavings in there until with it sticking and all of the shavings getting everywhere. 90% of the pencil shavings wouldn't have made it to the trash because of the poorly designed front part (which is where the shavings are supposed to come out). I returned it. I didn't bother testing the blades sharpness. Maybe the blades sharpness will make up for the fact that 90% of the pencil shavings would fall out.
1,barely strong enough to sharpen a pencil,"Lousy sharpener, I thought it would die on the first pencil, I had to keep pulling the pencil back a bit and letting the motor spin up (rest??) to then sharpen the pencil. They must use balsa wood on their pencils in China. This one is going back."
2,can't withstand the heat,"Looks good, but broke after a year while in the stove. Made a big mess. I gave it two stars because I like the look and how it was easy to clean."
5,Great addition!,Bought this for my niece for Christmas since she was looking for pieces to add to her Sango dinnerware collection. She was very pleased with this as was I. It's a beautiful addition and she loved it!
2,only finished reading it so I could say I've read it,from a huge fan--have read most of her books over the past ten years. This one lacks the passion and compelling characters of her other books. Try other Barbara Delinsky books instead.
5,Literature at its best!,You MUST read this novel. Its a classic. Its sure to provoke much thought and discussion. This novel is as sophisticated as any of the shelves. Its just a travesty that its not #1 on the New York Times.
2,Delinsky's most boring book,I love most of Barbara Delinsky's later books (not the old romances). But this one put me to sleep. Found it impossible to care about the characters. No depth.
3,Coast Road is a better read,"I found this story developed really slowly and I had to push myself to finish. I don't like the way that the author leaves her main characters helpless and floundering until the very end, it frustrates me as a reader!"
4,Great Book,"This book started a little slow, but was a great book after the first 50 pages. I loved the story line and plot twists. I have never read any other Barbara Delinsky books, but this has made me want to read more. Keep with the book it has a great ending."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable reading.,"In the first few pages of the book, I wondered if I was going to get ""into"" it. But it didn't take long for the story to get to me. I was surprised how angry I was when I read all that Lily was going through with the invasion of the press. It was a wonderful story, but I wondered why I felt disappointed at the end. John really socked it to the offending media, but something didn't sit well with me about that. I wanted her to be exhonerated, but when it came to be, it was sour."
4,A charming love story,"This book really emphasizes the value of home, love, honesty and integrity. This book starts slow in the sense where you get tired of the depression Lily is going through, but if you stick with it, her strength comes out more and more. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I wish Lily had had more strength all the way through."
5,a truly believable romantic book!,"I had trouble getting past the first couple of pages about the loons, but once I got past that, I could not put the book down. It was clean and suspensful, made my mad, and loved how she added the twist of romance!"
4,"My 1st Delinsky, but not my last!","The opening pages describing the loon on the lake took my breath away. That was only the beginning of a lovely day reading the rest of Lake News.I loved the characters, I felt that they were well drawn and likeable. This is a great book for a summer beach read. I highly recommend it to both men and women."
4,Lake News,"Took a bit for me to get into the story. Was interesting how his life changed. I felt empathy for the caracter and at the the same time you felt he needed a wake up call. Saw the movie after reading the book. I enjoyed the book more.Judy GrimmMountain Top, PA"
2,lake news,"I just couldn't get into this book, I'll try to restart it at a later date, when I'm less busy,like over the summer."
3,"My first of her books, and I was disappointed!","I was disappointed in this book. I did enjoy the fact that it was a good clean book, but felt that it just didn't add up. I am not good at ""giving up"" on books, but wished I had on this one. I can't really put my finger on what I didn't like....just felt it was a very slow read."
1,Lake Boring,"I love juicy summer reads, so I was disappointed to waste my time and money here. Crawling vanilla non-events happening to cardboard vanilla non-characters. If you've seen a blank coloring book, you'll get the idea."
2,It's still okay ......,"This is not a book as good as her past works. Her past works like Three Wishes and A Woman Betrayed actually lets you noe and understand what the character is feeling but Lake News lack the depth and feelings of the chracters and after you finish the book, you would not be able to understand why John loves Lily because there is totally no connections."
4,The power of the word,"Lake News was an enjoyable read--focusing on the power of the word and its ability to maim. One day Lili leads a private unassuming life and the next day she wakes up to find her good name and reputation smeared all over town via the workings of an over-ambitious and revengeful journalist. Seaking shelter in her quiet hometown in New Hamsphire, Lily finds comfort and solace in the form of John Kipling---another journalist of the local Lake News, but one who abides by the rules. John becomes Lily's knight in shining armor and helps Lily regain her dignity and reputation. Everyone has secrets from the past in Lake News which surface. This is my first Barbara Delinsky book, and I'm sure that I shall be reading more of her works in the future."
5,Excellent!,"I'll admit that I thought this book started off a little slow, but it was wonderful! I fell in love with Lily and all her heartaches. It was nice to read a romantic ""mystery"" where the good guys come out on top."
2,Narrative too repetitive and plodding.,"After reading Coast Road and Suddenly, I was looking forward to Ms. Delinsky's new book. Both of these prior efforts contained engrossing stories with well developed and interesting characters. I agree with the reader from the District of Columbia concerning the repetitive nature of the narrative. After a few chapters, I found the characters boring, and lost interest in the plot. Here's to future works that are more like Suddenly, Coast Road and Three Wishes!"
4,I feel like I am there,"Enjoyed this book, although Coast Road is still my favorite. Parts of Lake News seemed repetitive without seeming to be purposeful or productive. I wanted to keep reading in order to know more about John and Lily."
4,Great Summer Read,"The heart of this story is about the power of media influence in our society. Journalism is heavily influenced by many factors. LAKE NEWS brilliantly presents a story of the misuse and positive influence of journalism. The believability of the story, the characters, and the setting all add to how enjoyable this book is. Being a NH native I can attest to the truth of attitudes and language presented in the story. I love Ms. Delinsky's smooth writing style; it's effortless to read. A super summer reading choice."
4,Enjoyed it,I'm new reading this author and I am going to read Barbara Delinsky again. I read this book quickly and enjoyed it throughly. Good story about media sensationalism and character assasination. A little bit of romance but no sticky fake romance novel love.
4,Lake News,"This was a pretty good story; however, I had wished there was more. It made me hesitent on buying Delinsky again but was not a bad book. Just average."
3,Good-But not her best!,"I love Barbara Delinsky but sadly, I did not love Lake News! The emotions and relationships she portrays in her stories are usually realistic, touching and powerful. Lake News is a good story, but the characters lack depth and the kind of chemistry which draws me to her books. She usually creates a story that sizzles with realistic powerful emotions between the characters. The sizzle is missing. I was so disappointed! I saw no reason for the characters to get together. There just wasn't enough heat between them. Even though this book does not have the chemistry of previous books such as Together Alone or A Woman's Place, it is still worth reading because Ms. Delinsky just can't write a bad book. I just wished for more chemistry."
4,Not one of her best,"Definitly not one of her best. For the first 2/3 of the book, the plot was continually re-hashed. The characters became stale and the book didn't seem to move forward. The characters lacked depth, and the sub-plots were light and uninvolved.It was a disapointment considering her prior works."
3,Not one of her best,"I have read 16 Delinsky books, and loved most of them, but this one was the slowest to get into. She is great describing the loons and the regional charm of the area, but it didn't move fast enough for me. It is one you can put down and pick up again later at your leisure. I did finish it, but it took some time."
4,A good for people who want to learn C programming,"It is definitely a book for a starter by using simple, but not miss, example. On the other hand, it is also for the people who did not has any programming background."
4,A very Good Start to C Programming,Great book for a new starter. For something more indepth try A Book on C by Kelley and Pohl.
2,Frustrated by errors!,"This appeared to be a good book for beginners (I'm one!) until I began to have problems running the programs. After a few typographical errors I ran into more difficult problems in chapters 13 and 14 on functions. I first went to Que website to look for a list of errata but there was none. Later I went on line to a c/c++ newsgroup and got help. In the above chapters the functions in the examples should have been prototyped (declared before the main function) but were not. I would have more patience with this book if the publisher made some effort to correct these errors, other publishers do. This book will frustrate beginers rather than enlighten. I would not recommend this book."
1,"If you are serious, put it back","This book is full of errors, and it made me wonder where in the world this author got so many misconceptions about C. Evidently, he either has not read the book by Kernighan and Ritchie (the originators of C), or has not understood it, yet. If you want to become a serious programmer in C, consult the 2000 reviews at ACCU (Association for C and C++ Users) Internet site. If you just want to impress your friend at your first date, make sure your date does not know C better than this author, because this book is just as bad as so many C/C++ books in the market."
3,For beginners is OK!,"I had already read the book and found it is useful for beginners only but if you want to know more about ANSI C, I think it is not enough."
4,For Beginners Only,"This book is for the beginners and not for the Advanced C# programmer. There are a few statement structure mistakes in the book, but i would have never knew that unless i had read the fabulos book. The author also responds to your questions which is a plus although he may take a while since he is a buzy individual.What could have made this book really better though is some excercises to be done to test your C# programming knowledge, to see if u really understand it.All in all if you are looking for a book to start you up on C# programming this is the book for you."
3,Pretty good,"Although this is a very good rendition of Mozart's Requiem, I agree with 'A Customer' about Bohm's recording being the best; while Solti's sounds ""proper"" and ""technically right"", I would describe Bohm's recording as ""profound"". While Solti specialized in late Romantic and early 20th century music, Karl Bohm was known for his specialty in Mozart; he was entrusted to record all of the Mozart symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic in the 1960's. I would definitely recommend Karl Bohm's recording.If you are a singer, the Solti recording would be good for reference, since there are some awesome singers on this recording; if I had to rate the album *only* based on the soloists, I would probably give it at least 4 stars, if not 5."
3,NOT BAD,"I think The Version Of Karl Bohm Is better than Solti except The ""Lacrimosa"" it's wonderful. N.B:If you want to buy this CD i want to tell you that the time mentioned on The cd is 57min and this time is not true for the requiem of solti because there is also a part of The ""MESSE"" to Mozart."
4,Good for the soul,"After all the hassle, the traffic, and headaches, we all need to get away from the world (for a little while). With Motzart's Requim, you can do just that. It's just good for the soul."
4,lovely,This Mozart requiem is one of my favorite pieces and is sentimental to me. This performance does Mozart credit. I would recommend.
5,Fresh make it yourself salad dressing,"If you like green salads and like me, don't care for most of the bottled dressings, pick up some Good Seasons Cheese Garlic Salad Dressing. I can't buy it in any of my Ocala, Fl grocery stores but found I can order it online. Great tasting, and since you mix your own oil and vinegar with the package it's always fresh.Love that taste."
2,Wrong product,"I think you have two items with the same part number. In the picture above CR-141 is for a Cadillac Escalade. (for 2"" receiver)There is another Picture with the same part number CR-141 but in the discription it says it will fit EITHER a 2"" 0r 1.25"" receiver as I have 2012 Cadillac SRX with a 1.25"" receiver. Overstock Auto is working on the problem but has sent me the wrong item TWICE.ThanksJohn Blom702.324.6661"
1,When pleasing others is hurting you,"If your not co-dependant before you read this book, you will be after. This book leads you to think one thing and then hits you with another at the last minute. This book will force you to seek counseling after you read it. I thought the book would be about helping me understand what to do when I feel certain feelings when others hurt me, but it's nothing like that at all. Advoid this book."
2,Another 'cut-and-paste' book,"The title is misleading. It should have been ""You are not responsible! A guide for all you poor victimized women who wants to set that bastard husband strait (and lets face it, it's ALL his fault anyway). And lets not forget those horrible parents either, AND your siblings, AND everyone else..""I guess that title would not have fit on the cover :-) At least it would have been more telling...Codependency IS a real issue, and it deserves better coverage that this. It really is just a collage of texts taken from other, and better, books."
3,Disappointing,"This is not Howard Tate at his best. The songs are average, the arrangements average...his voice is as strong as ever; nonetheless, pedestrian outing. Everything else in his catalogue is a better starting point for the uninitiated."
4,ATV must,"Good basic book for beginning ATV adventurers,after reading through the book I began to realize how much I did not know that the book brought to light"
5,"Effective, portable, comfortable and cheap","This is probably one of the cheapest noise reduction headphones out there. It won't do the job of a Bose, but you could buy 8 Boses for the price of a pair of these headphones. The noise reduction isn't perfect, because these headphones don't press really hard on the ears to form a tight seal like the Bose does. However, this also means that these headphones are a good deal more comfortable. The other plus is that that these headphones fold up nicely into the handy bag provided. Uses one AAA battery that lasts about 12 hours or so."
5,Perfect for small heads!,These headphones are great! They are comfortable for long plane rides (5+ hours). But the best part is the flexible band that goes across the headband. I can never find over the ear headphones to fit me and these fit perfectly-- great for people with smaller heads! They sound great and do a great job of canceling outside noise.
4,Great Value for the money,"I compared with the Sony MDR NC5 ($50.). Earhuggers does a much better job at noise canceling. Due to an ear condition (if I'm on a plane too long, my ears start 'ringing'), I must have noise canceling headphones. I travel to Europe twice a year, and these are fairly comfortable even for a 9 hour flight. But more importantly, the noice cancellation is effective enough to protect by ear drums. Over the ear styles would be better, but I haven't found anything for less than $125, in this style. Structurally, they are a bit flimsy. After one year of use a strap broke. However, for the $30 - $40 price, I'm still going to buy another one."
2,answers answers,"From what we have seen, this is a straightforward vocab rote approach. This approach has both positive and negative aspects and works with some children and not with others. MY BEEF with this book is that it does not have an answer key and finding one has been more than difficult (still haven't at this point)."
1,Not Happy,"I received the book and it was written in and written on. I emailed the seller twice with no response to my request of a refund and the return of their book. I am very disappointed with the results of my order. I will never purchase another used book because you have sellers like Maria M. Peniche. The book was suppose to be in good condition, I was looking for bent pages or something but half of the book was written. I can't express it any more than Extremely upset and unhappy."
2,Very old,"It is very incredibly old book, all pages have been filled out with pen or pencil. I can not use it because all exercises have been done, I have to buy a new one. It was incredibly cheap but it is very fast, Thanks for everything"
2,Good but way overpriced,"Why I like them:These are straightforward vocab books. I create other activities to go with them, but I like the exercises.Why I'm not buying them now:Way overpriced!! Who wants to pay almost $20 for what is really a workbook? And why would I pay $15 including shipping for a **used** workbook that has already been used??"
4,Vocabulary workbook Level D,This purchase worked out after some communications. Amazon did very well with this and we appreciate it.Thank you for your service.
4,Just what I excpected,"This book was just like it described. Kind of warped, but no big deal. A great company"
4,Miles from Nowhere,"This was a very enjoyable movie! Although it wasn't quite an exellent one, it was still a very good one. I passed it on to someone who is involved in track!"
5,good movie,We just watched this movie the other day. Reallyenjoyed it. All father's should see it to remindthem that our children have to live their livesand not ours.
4,Fashion pill organizer,"It is really well made and holds a number of pills in each daily containter. If you take over 6 pills a day, get something different but if you take less, then definitely get this. I like the colors and it fits well in my purse. I am glad I got it."
3,Hard to use,"I found that this product was rather hard to use. You can center the pill and it will end up breaking into pieces. I don't use it anymore because of that, maybe with pills that are scored it would work okay."
4,Fascinating WWII Anthology,"This is an interesting collection of World War II stories that are both fascinating and true. Almost every story is an obscure gem that seizes your interest and will not let go. There are tales of intelligence and behind-the-scenes war stories that should make any history buff or person casually interested satisfied. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I would recommend it to anyone"
5,Book Review; Undercover Tales of World War II,"This book is full of great little vignettes about lesser known occurances of World War II. These are stories nobody could make up, but they really happened!!"
3,Interesting but not riveting,The stories are interesting and sometimes telling but the book is not a riveting page-turner. I am glad I bought and read it.
1,Not ergonomic,"This mouse works fine as a wireless, but is not comfortable or ergonomic as promised. Quite big and bulky. I would not recommend it for anyone."
2,sticky,"my carpel pain went away within a couple weeks, but i use XP, probably SP3, and even though i keep the pickup less than 6 inches away, the mouse sticks as you pan around the screen making it incredibly annoying and i am thinking that i need to look for another one before i go crazy."
5,Best Thing In My Hand Since My Date Last Night,"I've been looking to upgrade from my crappy but serviceable Logitech notebook mouse for a few weeks. Looked online and went shopping today after work. Best Buy didn't have much but Office Depot had a little bit more, including three shopping carts full of mouses they were getting ready to put on clearance. Sifting through the carts I found this little beauty. Great ergonomic design, feels very natural on a flat surface to have you hand at a slight angle. Logitech made a model that I liked that was $99, this was $39.99 - 25% for being a display model.I run OS X Leopard and installation consisted of plugging in the RF dongle, which sits on the desk, but it took all of three seconds. I had some reservations regarding how well this would play with OS X, I couldn't be happier and it's only been a few minutes."
5,Amazing lifetime device,"Quicky and short: This is the best mouse I ever had (and I had a lot and still have others much more expensive)Just use a correct mousepad and keep it clean from dusty (which may produce undesired effects like shaking mouse pointer or erratic/involuntary movements) and that is it... oh, and a good pair of alkaline batteries too. ;)Im using mine since august 2005, every day (from 10am to 4am) and not a single problem at all."
2,Good mouse but not reliable,I love the ergonomic features on this mouse but its reliability is worse than I would have expected from Microsoft.This is the 3rd mouse I've had and none of them have lasted more than 2 years.Mouse keys stick which cause the images on screen to act as if the page down key was being held.What's bad is that my company paid for all 3 mice and has not gotten its money's worth for each purchase.I love this mouse but I hate its reliability.
1,"Decent Comfort, Really BAD Connection to Computer","I just got this mouse in an attempt to find something less painful for my hand. Technically, this mouse IS more comfortable. While I wish it didn't have straight buttons (whose hand has fingers that don't curve in the ""natural"" position?), as that still requires a slight twist in the arm to hold it, it's a step up from a regular mouse. But...only ONE step.My biggest complaint, however, is that the function just isn't smooth. The cursor is constantly hesitating, not registering clicks, or freezing onscreen briefly, and all that with the receptor device about three inches away from the actual mouse. (Yes, that kind-of defeats the purpose of wireless, but this thing just gets worse with distance, as other reviewers have noted.) So, while it is more comfortable to hold, I end up clicking MORE often than I did before because the clicks aren't registering. I'm definitely returning this sad excuse for a usable mouse to the store."
2,Piece of junk,"My product came defective. That is not my complaint -- it could happen to anyone. It took a lot of writing back and forth with customer service reps with few manners to convince them that it was, indeed, defective. I have used a Microsoft ergonometric mouse before. I love the feel in my hand. However, this latest model is so flimsly. Too bad, it's a good product idea."
5,wireless mouse review,"this is my 4th wireless mouse and while it took a bit to get use to by way of grip, it very comfortable to work with .. i love it."
3,Works well.,"This mouse worked well for getting rid of my sore wrist and I have no complaints about it. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I just couldn't get used to it. I would need to use this mouse everywhere, and I didn't want to buy 3 of them."
5,Great product !,"This is the World's GREATEST mouse. Feels great,easy to use,long battery life.Has many extras and anyone can use it with ease.Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 - Black"
3,Too Large for My Hand,"This mouse is very large, and after a week I've given up and am giving it to a friend who has large hands and loves it. The hand position you are supposed to use with it is awkward and sends shooting pains up my arm. I'm looking for a smaller, more comfortable mouse that fits my hand better."
1,"Nothing ""natural"" about it","I bought this mouse in a vain attempt to keep my wrist and thumb from hurting. While it might be designed for comfort, it isn't designed to actually track like every other mouse on the planet. You move the mouse horizontally to the left and the cursor goes and a pretty good angle up and to the left! There's no way this mouse can be used with any great efficiency in Photoshop or Illustrator or any other application that requires ""normal"" cursor movement.What a complete disappointment."
2,Poor Design,"There are lots of nice features about this mouse - it's shape, the feel of the buttons, the size and weight. But from a practical, usage perspective, it failed in one important area - it is very uncomforatble to use. If used in the proper hand position - i.e., hand on the side of the mouse (neutral wrist position) vs. hand on top of the mouse (pronated wrist position), it forces your pinkie finger to drag against the mouse pad (or other surface) as you move the mouse around. While probably not annoying enough to bother anyone for the first 30-60 min of use, it's extremely bothersome for all-day, office use. I also have an Evoluent ergo mouse; and the Evoluent mouse flares out at the bottom to form a small platform, which supports the user's hand. With the Evoluent mouse, my hand glides effortlessly over the mouse pad, without ever contacting the surface. I'd recommend spending a little more money, and buying the Evoluent ergo mouse."
2,Very short range,"Pro: comfortable grip, good wrist position, lightweight.Con: extremely short range! Literally, if more than 5 inches away from the receiver, the mouse pointer movement often becomes erratic and jerky, 2 feet away -- loses the signal completely. I haven't seen a worst range from a wireless mouse/product ever, and I've used a couple dozens of different ones over the years."
2,"Better, But Not Perfect","This mouse is a lot better than most others, but it's still not perfect. My hand rests at a more natural angle, but the thumb rest is sort of awkwardly placed. After trying to get used to it for a week or two, I just started holding the way that felt most natural. I don't know if I'm doing it ergonomically or not, but it feels a lot better to me.One complaint: the wheel is very difficult to click down on. I use that middle click constantly in Firefox, and it's very irritating that it takes so much force to do so."
4,Great mouse for comfort...,This mouse was very comfortable and relieved my wrist discomfort immediately.(believe it or not). I was in complete disbelief that wrist problems would arise from usinga computer. once I began video editing the pain began along with a some stiffening. this mouse relieved it. it is an all around good buy. I would recomend it for the price i payed($35). It is very accurate for photoshop as well. The only con i have is that it doesnt have an on off button or rechargeable batteries(although myh power is still as good as new for a month now with moderate use.
5,Patrick B,"This is a very nice mouse. Seems a little large setting on the desktop, but the feel is very good. Your hand lays comfortably and the buttons are about right."
2,still have pain :(,I've had this mouse for a little while and the good points areit's solidit has many programmable buttonsit's precisegood battery lifethe bad pointsthe angle still is not verticle enough to relieve the pain on top of my hand and wrist
2,Disappointed,"After using this mouse for six weeks, I still cannot find a comfortable way to use it. Wrist & hand fatigue develops very quickly for me even though I've tried raising and lowering the mousing surface, using a wrist rest and adjusting my thumb & wrist positions. Another source of irritation is the screen flicker that occurs momentarily when switching between applications (apparently a bug in the IPoint software that installs). Using with WindowsXP."
3,Issues with wireless range and such,"(bad) The wireless mouse works fine, and was easier on my wrist. It also comes with a USB wireless transmitter with a long cord. With my metal desk, I have to set the transmitter within 8"" or so from the mouse for the mouse to work properly. (I did use brand new batteries.)(good) One advantage is that the mouse does not have a on/off switch. You just leave it on, and it has its own power management (unlike my blue-tooth mouse with which I have to constantly remember to turn it off).(bad) The middle mouse button does not work (at least on this one I have). The wheels works, but when I press the wheels down, (for X-Window paste function) it only works about 10% of the time.(bad) What I wish the mouse could have added is an area where I can rest my finger upon without triggering any mouse button. It is tiring to have to keep my palm up all the time when using the mouse."
2,I liked my logitech better,Been using this about a month. I have a small hand and this MAYBE gave me a tiny bit more comfort. I really can't tell a difference. My hand is raised about an inch where my index finger rests but it does not turn my wrist the way it is advertised. I have to put my index finger over to the left side of the mouse which turns my wrist over to the same position as a regular mouse. The buttons would need to be on a more vertical line for it to work the way they claim. To use the thumb buttons I have to pick my hand up off the table to reach the second one. This is basically just an extra tall mouse. ALSO I have my mouse 1 foot away from the reciever and I frequently lose the connection. This is the worst mouse I have ever owned as far as that goes. I will be replacing it.
2,The mouse that lasted a few hours,"Received this mouse today. Unboxed and I was excited.. Need relief on my wrist.. Plugged in and the CD it came with was blocked by Windows 7 (x64) for compatibility issues. No problem, download Intelipoint from MS site and that was resolved.Installation went fine and I began using it right away.. It would not work on a simple $3 mouse pad. If froze often.. It was very inaccurate, shaky and jerky on my desk (wood). Left clicking became multiple and triple left clicking.. I tried it on 3 workstations at the job, same resultI wouldn't waste anymore time on something that shouldn't be so difficult..Boxed the mouse back up and back to Amazon it went with UPS. I'm thinking about the Wow Pen or Evoluent mouse right now. Cant believe there isn't such a larger market for ergonomic mice."
5,Very comfortable mouse,Had this product before and the minute it died I replaced it.It's ergonomic andit's very responsive. After this you won't want any other mouse.
4,Very Comfortable Mouse,"I bought this mouse to use at work since I work on a computer 8+ hours a day and was finding my standard size/shape mouse to be giving me hand cramps. This mouse is very comfortable and ergonomic. It takes a little getting used to the bigger feel and the way its tilted off to the side but once you get used to using it, it feels great. I haven't had any hand cramps since switching to it. Also the scroll wheel is very smooth and makes no noise when moving it. It takes 2 AA batteries (that are included) and I've been using the set that came with it for about a month now for about 8 hours a day 5 days a week so battery life is pretty good if you ask me. If you are in the market for a comfortable ergonomic mouse I highly suggest getting this one. I've seen this mouse in stores for around $75 but got it here for about $35 with free shipping so I definitely recommend buying it online instead of in a store."
3,"Big, heavy mouse!","The mouse is way too big for small hands, if you're petite then DO Not buy this mouse, it is way too heavy for a small hand, it is noisy and not easy to adapt to its shape, it takes some time. This mouse is so heavy and big, that should be marketed for men only... I got rid of the box so I couldn't return it, otherwise I'd would."
2,You know your wireless mouse has a problem when...,"you have to keep a spare wired mouse around, for when the wireless mouse is getting fussy. Yep. I've reset the mouse, reset the base, moved the base upside down, right side up, I've sung, I've danced, I've prayed, I've tried aromatherapy.But this lovely, ergonomic, quirky little mouse has bad days when I have to put it aside. The ergonomics are very nice, but the reliability is bad. Just not worth the trouble.I have a Logitech MX1100 which doesn't have any such problems at all. Ever."
3,Not much ergonomic support,"I have been using this mouse for about two weeks now and am ready to give it up. I have large hands (XL glove size) and gripping this mouse it not much better than gripping a standard mouse. It is just too small to force the hand to stay in a natural position. I also have thumb pain and since this mouse is much heavier than a standard mouse, and the wheel has some built in friction making it slightly harder to spin. It forces me to grip the mouse pretty hard which causes thumb pain after a couple of hours.In comparison, I have an Evoluent ergonomic mouse which is much more comfortable for all day use. The problem I have with that mouse is that the wheel does not behave the standard way in some applications."
2,Not Comfortable poor location of side buttons!,Generally a very well performing mouse. Very responsive and precise but uncomfortable as the side buttons are too far back. My hands are just medium male size - I find that I have to lift my hand off the mouse to use the side buttons in reality that makes the mouse a real pain to use. What could they been thinking of when they designed the location of the side buttons.
1,Does not live up to the HYPE,"It's wireless, very comfortable, but it's jumpy. I don't know where the problem is, but when you move the mouse, even just a little bit, it jumps. I adjusted the different settings for the mouse, Sensitivity and such, ""No Joy"" in fixing it. For me it was unusable and I retured it to the store where I purchased it at. If you play games, or need real sensitivity, move to another mouse. This one will make your head hurt."
4,Good for big hands,"I love this! although not very exact,it is comfortable. my wrist never hurts anymore. But my wife hates it.So only good for big hands, small hands better step away from it.It is too big!"
2,Not As Good As It Looks,"I am a pro graphics designer. I was using this mouse for 30 minutes today, thinking it's shape would be great. But I actually have more pain than with my standard wireless MS mouse. This design SEEMS like it makes sense. And store models feel right. But in use, this mouse is just no good. Returning it soon. It's a relief going back to my original mouse."
2,it's... ok,"this has a more ergonomic shape than a standard mouse but I think it's not really enough to make a huge difference. I tried this mouse out for a little while and it didn't completely solve my problems with discomfort, it helped a little but not enough to settle on this model. The silicon pad where the thumb goes for some reason has begun to degrade, yellow, become bumpy... it feels nasty... this happened after relatively little use. I think it's not really ergonomic enough to be considered an ergonomic mouse."
5,Mouse Review,This is a great mouse. The only problem I have is that I accidentally hit the magnify button on the side. That gets a little annoying but it is easy to click off. It has really helped my carpel tunnel problem.
5,Comfortable mouse,"I like this mouse a lot and was disappointed I couldn't find it in the local stores (Office Max, Best Buy, etc.). I had the same model for a couple of years and ended up breaking it when I moved my office. Amazon came through with a great price and quick delivery. This is a very comfortable mouse if you have big hands and/or use a mouse a lot for work. It keeps your arm tilted at the proper angle to reduce any CT in your wrist. It makes a fairly loud 'clicking' sound when you hit any of the buttons but overall it's a solid mouse that will last."
3,I expect someting better,A little brief:Pros:-Beautiful-Elegant-Good position of my wrist-Perfect sizeCons:- The reciver is very big- The software for magnification image have problems whith AUTOCAD 2009 and i have to uninstal- The scroll is very rugged and hard
2,Wireless problems...,"I my experience ALL wireless products are inherently unstable just like the reception on a cell phone. The signal can encounter interference from many sources and when that happens you can experience a range of problems...and this was my main issue with this mouse...Not sure if its defective...but on a regular basis the click and double-click don't seem to be work...have to keep clicking. Sometimes the mouse slows down to a crawl...all seems like some kind of interference with the wireless signal between the mouse and base unit.Aside from that...the design of the mouse is good. The problem is that the mouse is too small. I have small hands and its too small for me so your finger tips hang over the front of the mouse and actually clicking on the buttons is a bit more difficult. Basically they need to make mouses in different sizes like clothes: S, M, L :)At the moment I just stopped using it...I guess that's why its so cheap now :|"
4,Microsoft mouse,"I bought and reviewed the Microsoft 69k-00001 Natural wireless laser mouse 6000. It does fit my hand like a glove, no wrist pain. Sometimes the mouse does not acknowledge when I have clicked it though. That becomes very frustrating when you have a job that you are on the computer all day."
3,Ok for someone with small hands,This is a very comfortable mouse - IF you have small to medium hands. If your hands are large/extra large then don't bother.
1,A real disappointment,"I have purchased dozens of items from Amazon. Never returned a single one. Until now. I am returning this mouse. I thought the ergonomic design would be an improvement. It actually does feel good and puts less stress on the wrist. But, none of this matters if the mouse doesn't work. And a lot of the time, it doesn't. The wireless connection is periodically lost. I have changed batteries. Moved the receiver, etc. Nothing helps. At times, the mouse is unresponsive. It is totally unreliable and often useless. I have had to keep a traditional mouse ready at all times so I can use it when this one fails.Evidently, Microsoft is aware of some of the issues. It would have been nice if the mouse were 100% reliable BEFORE it was introduced to market.I would not recommend this product. Save yourself the aggravation and frustration. Buy a different brand. There are too many other mice available to chose from."
3,Transmitter/Receiver Too Big,Overall this is a good and comfortable wireless mouse. The main problem is that it requires a very large transmitter/receiver to be attached via cable to the computer to operate. Most modern day wireless mice use an easily transportable USB wireless adapter that does not require cabling.
2,Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse,"I do not recommend this if you have small hands. It is large and bulky, also if you use it on a laptop it constantly messes up you home screen."
2,ergonomic NOT,Tried mouse for a week but it never felt comfortable in my hand. Didn't scroll or track well when used on a hard white desk surface or on a mouse pad. Double buttons located in a hard to each location. I didn't feel that this mouse offered a better feel than a regular mouse plus its other deficiencies.
1,Don't buy unless you can return!,"In searching for an ergonomic mouse, this one felt good in my hand at the store. In use, however, it is so tall that my wrist needed to flex upwards. Very uncomfortable. I joked with my colleagues that it would make a great projectile, and I felt like throwing it out of frustration. If I've learned anything in the search for comfort, it is that all reviews are subjective. Perhaps with proper elbow support and overall correct ergonomic workspace setup this will work for you, but it did not for me.In terms of function, I have no real complaints, but the comfort factor just wasn't there for me."
1,ouch,"I got this mouse about two hours ago. I wanted a new, ergo mouse. I have small hands, and maybe it's that, but I had instant wrist pain/numbness, my palm hurt after about a half hour, and I'm going back to my original Mac Mighty Mouse until I can find a decent ergonomic mouse that won't make my hand and wrist problems worse. I'm really disappointed, because I had very high hopes! I'm returning it tomorrow."
1,Burns batteries and conflicts with software,"This mouse is very comfortable to use. Unfortunately, it is optical, which means that it burns batteries. It also conflicts with other software on your computer. There were several times that I had to restart my computer and my screen saver stopped working. But when I started having trouble with Adobe Reader, I disconnected the mouse for good (Note: my computer stopped acting up).Why can't anyone manufacture a real ernomoic mouse that doesn't need special software (Note: not optical, not with 5 buttons), so that those of us who suffer from carpal tunnel can use the computer?"
4,This is great but....,"I love this mouse, but I have a problem when the mouse is coneccted to USB port the screen saver on my computer wont work,so if I have to go out i have to unplug it. Can someone help"
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought this and used it three times on my Apple iMac and it just stopped working. I returned it and got another one that did the same thing.Also, it's not a bluetooth wireless which means it requires that you plug a receiver into a USB jack. This takes up desktop space and a USB plug that is usually needed by other peripherals."
1,Pain,"My wrist was aching a half hour after I started using this. Also, it sits up so high that if your mousepad goes under your desk at all, you will need more clearance. A huge disappointment."
2,Horrible mouse.,"had a logitech wireless laser mouse with an internal non-replaceable battery that finally stopped holding a charge after about 8 years... so I got this mouse and it is shaped VERY weird. Have been using it for 2 weeks now and cannot get used to it. The position is just weird and i cannot accurately move the mouse around.. Also, I don't like that the wheel doesn't click when you turn it. I could live with that, but not being able to do my job as fast is not something I can live with.. Oh well.. I'll throw it up on flea bay and sell it and buy a different one."
2,chaunceygerard,"I purchased this mouse to retire a 10 year old unit that was requiring new batteries every couple of days. The mouse is principal used for AutoCad and requires programable buttons. The problem with this new mouse is it does not allow the ""Esc"" key to be programed. This key is essential to operating AutoCad. Microsoft called me after I contacted them and said they were working on the problem. I have not heard from them in month."
1,stay away,"I really wanted to like this mouse but I could not stand it. First, this thing is heavy. This hurts the precision; the movement of the cursor is anything but smooth. Next, it is not long enough. The wheel is not where I would expect it to be. I played with it for 15-20 minutes and put it back in the box."
2,mouse didn't work - had to return it,"The feel of the mouse is good, but it won't work on either of our computers. It must be a lemon. I went ahead and ordered another from Dell, and will return this one."
2,Weird angles,"Unlike other reviewers, I found this mouse to be comfortable. However, moving the mouse directly left caused the mouse pointer to move just as much up as it did left (take the mouse you're using now and turn it counter-clockwise 45 degrees in your hand to see what I mean). If I held the mouse in a position that let me move the pointer normally, it was very uncomfortable and the buttons were hard to hit. I gave up after a few hours and returned it. The radio seemed above par though."
4,Worthy Product,Have had this mouse for 6 months. It works well. Comfortable to use. As far as ergonomic design it orients your hand in a position similar to a handshake resulting in less forearm twist. Nice features such as vertical and horizontal scrolling with the wheel. Attractive packaging.The only problem is that I do keep hitting the magnify button by mistake with my thumb. Not a real big deal though.
1,Disappointed,I hated this product. A mouse is only as good as it responsiveness and usability. I felt that I was physically dragging the pointer around the screen. Would not recommend to anyone!
4,No More Wrist Pain,"The main reason I tried this product was to relieve the constant wrist pain I had from a standard mouse. It worked. The pain is gone. Basically, this mouse enables you to work with your wrist in more of a 45 degree angle rather than flat, putting less stress on the wrist joint. I saw results - wrist pain gone - within a day. It was awesome!On the con side, it is a bit different to use. I am fairly efficient with a mouse. This style takes some getting used to. I'm not sure I've mastered it yet. You end up with your wrist ""wrapped"" around this mouse so you are clicking at a different angle. But the extra nano seconds it takes to zero in on a clickable spot vs no more wrist pain is a trade I'll take every time."
1,Breaks Quickly,"I've purchased two of these mice, and both have stopped working in under a year. Even when functional, the transmission distance seems to be about 8 inches. at that point, a wired device seems like a much better choice."
3,The product helps with carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms.,"Something about it causes the batteries to drain very quickly. We are changing them every week, this can add up quickly with the price of batteries these days. We are going to get a wired one instead and retire the wireless one all together."
4,intelligent dance...this is it,"The term intelligent dance music emerged a decade or more ago for probably a few reasons--including differentiating music that had a beat-centric base but was not simple, boring or uninvolving.This very hard to find out-of-print Shakatura debut CD is one of the strongest examples of IDM and has created its own mystique over the past few years. Ceiba, the label, has also released cool innovative stuff from Tom van Draft (Thomas Fanger)."
1,Not worth the price they're charging on this site.,"This price for the cd is OUTRAGEOUS! The music is good, but I found all the song downloads on another site for .10 cents per song."
2,NO ERA LO QUE ESPERABA,"ME ESPERABA ALGO MEJOR PERO HAY SOLO UNA CANCION LA DE SILVESTRE QUE ES BUENA ,LAS DEMAS ..........????????"
2,other than expected,"Assumed this title would describe traditional folk remedies, but it merely repackages New Age therapies for an African-American audience."
4,pooh bear,"The toy was pretty great! Made by Fisher Price it was alittle different than the actual Disney Doll, but it was still pretty large and soft so that was a plus. came in a large box within a few days with regular shipping."
2,"""mildly dissatisfied Charles,"" I agree","I may be more than mildly dissatisfied, though, Charles. Why do some pianists confuse speed with interpretation and quality of performance? Thibaudet, Hough, others are prone to this kind of self-indulgent display. J-Y T flies through parts of the Tombeau so fast there is no time or space for interpretation. We are left with a blur of notes, apparently accurately rendered, but without much nuance, shaping of line. I really thought his purpose here was to get into the Guinness Book of World Records. I am not impressed with finger-flickers showing off their dexterity. I would like to have the music, thank you, and have it presented as the composer intended and indicated in the score. Y-T, you can play Ravel your way; give me someone who plays Ravel his way. Would anyone like to nominate the best Ravel pianist of all time? Perlemuter, Roge, Grimaud? Someone else?P. S. Please pardon the clumsy reference to Wanda Landowska."
2,bleaugh...,"I dont know about anyone else but I'm a bit tired of recordings like this. I mainly bought it for 'Gaspard' because I have heard recordings of him playing all the other pieces.how IRRITATING! so fast and dry and showy.In scarbo in particuular there were many speedy dry parts that coupled with a clever recording engineer and the perfect piano seem to attempt to hide the fact that he can be very uneven at times.Why is this person regarded as such a great Ravel interpreter? His interpretations in this respect are extrely puzzling and very self serving. I personaly regret spending money on it.I think the next great interpertation of Gaspard will be someone who is brave enough to follow the score as it is.Michelangeli famously said of scarbo ""Vif - lively but not actually as fast as possible"""
2,Buyer beware,"You should know that there is NOTHING printed in this book, it's totally blank. It is not obvious from the listing that it is. While I admit this IS somewhat funny, I didn't need to spend 3.99 plus shipping to get the joke. It would make a humorous shower gift though."
4,Good For The & Runs Small,"I purchased the black dress. It is true that if you have a generous bust (I have a size DD), the dress is not a ""perfect"" fit. I tried on 2 different sized convertible bras on with this dress and the bigger bra could be seen from the side view while the smaller bra wasn't---but with the smaller bra, the side of my breasts show a little bit. The dress does fit like a glove, and definitely runs small b/c I've never worn a 3X in my life, even if it is Junior's. Normally I wear anywhere from a L-2X depending on the maker and whether or not it's a Junior size. So with this dress, definitely go by the size chart, but keep in mind it runs small so maybe try a size bigger or be aware that it may ""just fit"". I received this dress within 5 days of my order, which was before the delivery estimate."
2,Unfortunate!,"Received the dress promptly, but...and plus sized ladies please note...the bust area is NOT designed for a fuller-figured lady! I couldn't even get ""the girls"" into it...I was falling out all over! This dress is most definitely not designed for a larger-busted woman! Otherwise, it was a really cute dress....but had to return it."
2,Navy ruched halter dress,These dresses are pretty but they ARE NOT true to size! I normally wear a 3x but ordered a 5x knowing that if was too big I could take it in and the 5x fit like a 2x! This was terribly inconvient to me because I bought this dress for my parents wedding and ended up having to go buy another one because I didn't have time to send it back.
3,Beautiful dress,The dress is beautiful but what I have found out ordering cloths on Amazon is that the sizes are not true sizes. Which is very disappointing. I would order far more on Amazon but every thing that I have ordered has not worked for me size wise. I am a XL and I ordered a 5X and the dress is to tight. I had to pay to get it altered to work.But I do want the customers to know that the dress is very pretty and looks great now that I had it altered.
1,Don't buy if you need to wear a bra.,"Think the title pretty much says it all - this neckline (if you can call it that) plunges WAY down and leaves little to the imagination and the back also is pretty low so if you're particularly busty like me and absolutely must wear a bra to keep the ladies up, don't buy this dress. It would look cute probably on some skinny teenager with A-cups, but on a grown woman, no. I'm planning to send it back once the post office is not so crowded from the holidays."
4,Perhaps a Little too sexy!,"Stunning dress. But a little too stunning for the company party! I'm keeping it for a night on the town. I must have very long legs, because it's way too short on the shorter side..."
4,hides nothing and rides up a little but otherwise nice dress,"As others have said it is very form fitting so panty lines would show. I am 5'4"" and curvy. The burgundy is a pretty dress and the fabric is nice. The only complant would be that it seems to ride up a little after awhile."
1,MOM,This dress was like wearing a dress made of nylons the material was gross. It looked nice on the but once i got it and touched it nasty.
2,A Huge Disappointment,I was really looking forward to receiving this dress. When it did finally arrive it was waded up in a plastic bag. The dress looks nothing like the photo. Oh yes it is a halter dress but as for the lovely drapping look that does not come across in the dress they mailed to me. The size was not an issue it fit however as I said the dress in the picture is not the dress you will receive. Perhaps that is why the seller does not have a model in this dress. Save your money ladies or try a halter dress from newport-news they a few that are far better than this ... halloween costume.
2,Not Flattering,"Okay, I read all of the reviews before I bought this product. I thought it would be okay, but I was severely wrong. If you are a woman like me, and are very curvy, and wear a C-D cup, then do NOT buy this dress. Don't get me wrong, it's a great dress, but it just wasn't right for my body type. At all. It didn't hide ANYTHING. And it wasn't quite big enough for my chest. The length is pretty good. Starts just below the knee, and then goes diagonally downwards towards the right. However, if you do not like VERY clingy things, do NOT buy this dress. Very curvy women just don't look good in this dress."
3,Looks different than the picture,"This dress is nice, but it doenst look like the picture once you get it. The top is for small busted girls, if you have a larger chest, it probably wont work for you, the top is just really small. The company was great, received my order in just 3 days and they gave me no problem with my return. I would order from them again, just not this dress."
3,ruched ruffle halter dress,"It looks so elegant in the picture. It does not look that way in person. It is an o.k. dress but it is a spandex bodice. It has an 80's looks on due to what the bodice is make out of. Does not flow like the picture and the tie around the neck short, not long and drapy like in the picture. Somewhat disappointed but not waisting anymore money to send back. The color is very nice."
4,Nice dress,"It is a very nice dress, but not for curvy women. I got a medium and the halter-chest area is only big enough for an A or B cup. Everything else just looks silly."
2,2 sizes too small,I ordered it a size bigger and it was still 2 sizes too small. Its a pretty dress if you have a good smooth body.
2,bellow my expectations,"It was not what I expected. It fits larger than what the seize chart shows, and as a result it does need a bra, however, the cut makes much more difficult to find a suitable bra. Does not feel very dressy."
3,Dress is better on manaquin but not bad1,"I ordered this dress for my honeymoon. I'm not big into dresses at all but i thought this looked really cute. I am a bustier girl, not anorexic. If you are bigger wear spanks, it won't show anything then, but if you have a big booty it is gonna be sort. The ruffles in the back go down to the back of my knees but as you can see they are a little sheer. The thickest part of the dress goes just of my butt and it will probably be hard to find a bra or pasties to go on the top but will make it work. All in all i love the feel and look it just will show my food baby after dinner."
2,Thanksgiving,I normally wear a medium to large. I ordered a large and I felt like a turkey stuffed in plastic wrap. Its a beautiful dress but very thin and runs really small. If you do order this wear it in the summer and order a size bigger then the biggest size you wear.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered five dresses from this place (trying to find a bridesmaid dress). I felt that this dress, along with the other four, was cheaply and poorly made, which I guess isn't surprising because it costs so little. It probably would have looked fine on somebody else anyway, but it definitely didn't look good on me. That's fine, not everything you try on will look good, but the sizing here is way off, by normal size standards AND by their own size charts. I normally wear probably a 2X, but this 5X was VERY snug, and by their size charts it should have fit easily. For some of their other dresses, a 3X was way too big, so there's no continuity there. Also, the cut was very strange on almost all of the dresses, meaning they would be tight some places and way too loose in others. I've never had that problem before.I will say this: the dresses came quickly and, when returned, my refund was prompt."
3,Not as Pictured,"I bought the burgundy version of this dress in size small. I usually wear a size 4 in dresses, and this was pretty snug. As others have said, the material is very thin and clingy, and it does show every bulge. I am not happy with the halter on this dress. In the actual dress, the panels that cover the bust are not as wide as you see in the photo, so it shows a lot more cleavage and makes it difficult to wear a bra without it showing. There are seams that come up from under the arms to the center of the ""V"" and they are placed too high, so they end up on top of the breasts instead of under them if you try to hike up the halter to make it look more like it does in the photo. I'm thinking maybe I should have bought a medium and perhaps that would have more fabric in the halter, but I'm trying to decide if it's worth the risk of exchanging the dress and having the same problem in the medium one, vs. returning it."
3,"Beautiful, but very clingy",The material is thin and the dress fits very clingy. Other wise the dress is beautiful. I was disappointed that the dress didn't work out for me.
5,I bought the burgundy and want to buy more!,I bought the burgundy one for my Argentine Tango dances. I will definately be using it in performances where I can and it's ultra comfortable. I ordered a medium (which is my size UK size 10) but it was on the small size so I will get a large next time just for that extra bit of comfort as they do come up on the slightly smaller side.I had nothing but flattering comments all night and felt really good in it.Beautiful dresses and I will be getting one in Navy just as soon as they get the Large back in!PS. I'm from the UK - what colour is Eggplant!? What is an eggplant? - I have a funny image in my head! :D
5,FUN DRESS!!,"I READ OTHERREVIEWS AND WASN'T SURE I HAD MADE A GOOD CHOICE, BUT I AM SMALL CHESTED AND SMALL FRAMED SO THE DRESS FIT SNUG BUT VERY COMPLIMENTING,,, I ORDERED THE BLACK ONE TOO..."
3,Andras vs. Andrei,"The reason I brought this CD is mainly for my comparison with the Andrei Gavrilov on the French suite no. 5. My conclusion is: In many ways, I think Schiff seems to be trying very hard to make the piano sounds like harpsichord while playing all those baroque music. In a big contrast, Gavrilov has totally captured the very nature of piano and played the no. 5 suite so beautifully!!"
5,Very Good Production,"My response to this CD is very positive. From the tracks I have previewed and played on air I think the production values are very high. I have discussed for my listeners the personal significance of ""Lord Inchiquin"" in my repertoire of fiddle tunes. Joe Cavanagh, WHUS 91.7 FM, Storrs, Connecticut"
5,The Harper's Reverie-Irish Music of Turlough O'Carolan,"Cool! (This is very nice music and my aunt says it makes for a GREAT St Patrick's Day gift---for all ages! The music is varied and light,....)I listen to it with her in her car all the time.miss emily(as told to her aunt)"
5,A delightful collection of O'Carolan,"I am very pleased! The quality of the music is astounding, not to mention the variety of instruments. This truly is a delightful collection of O'Carolan's music. It will definitely be getting airtime on my show. Melissa Hollopeter, WMTU 91.9 FM Houghton, Michigan"
2,Solti.Tchaikovsky 4,"Une grosse déception. Dans une discographie surchargée, ce disque n'apporte rien d'autre que les sonorités pesantes des (superbes) cuivres de Chicago, outrageusement mises en avant par une prise de son spectaculaire mais peu subtile. Gestion très personnelle des tempi (beaucoup d'accélérations nerveuses superflues - et non écrites-) sans vraie conception d'ensemble autre qu'une lecture découpée et nerveuse mais sans drame profond, ni mystère. Hautbois très médiocre en début de second mouvement. Le troisième, épais et mécanique demeure inhabité. Le finale rugit avec un pompiérisme conquérant vite lassant. Solti appuie exagérément les verticalités de la partition en courant le risque d'entraver le cours naturel des phrases. Peu utile et négligeable face à Mravinski (DG; Sanderling (DG); Bernstein II (DG); Svetlanov II (Canyon); Jansons (Chandos)."
3,Not completely pleased,"The cd I ordered arrived on time and I was pleased with that. However, it was a gift for a friend, and when I opened the outside packaging, I found that the cd case was badly cracked. Indeed, it looked as if the case was cracked when it was packaged. I did not have enough time to return it as I was giving it as a gift and there wasn't enough time to get a replacement. As it turned out,the cd inside the case was fine, but it was disappointing that because of the cracked case it looked to be second hand."
2,Save your money,"I bought a set of the lecture tapes to occupy myself during my hour plus drive to and from work, and to referesh my memory of what I learned and forgot from college. Although Mr. Feynman was a great physicist, and I'm sure his lectures were entertaining in person, the taped lectures fall short. Between the constant volume changes in his voice as he thinks while he's speaking, and the changing of nomeclature within the lectures, a lot of the impact is lost by not being able to follow what he is writing on the chalkboard. Get a good book on tape instead."
5,Why I Believe,"Neat book! This is a compilation of the stories of conversion and testimony of many 'famous' individuals who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.More than just for my interest, because the list of individuals covers a broad range of occupations and fame, the stories can be appreciated by members of my family, and friends, with similar and varied interests.Well packaged and quicky shipped!"
1,I mistakenly bought this 64mb card,"I was looking for a 64 gig card. I mistakenly bought this 64mb card. The price would have been a great at $44.00 for a 64 Gig card, however for a 64mb the price was outrages. I sent back the card and was refunded the price less 20%."
3,decent rack...Has helped me organize my caps,"The cap rack is fairly decent. My caps are now much better organized and the ""clutter"" has been removed."
4,Functional,"Fits all of my hats securely and nicely. However, one of the elastic straps was not as flexible as the other, so it took quite a lot of pulling and hardship to get the hook over the door. Other than that, this product is great."
5,Just what Nana ordered,I have three young grandsons who have many caps and hats. They had a big box full of hats that was overflowing inside the front door. Now the hats are arranged on the back of their bedroom door where they can see them all and have still have access to them.
4,Will buy again!,I have bought these twice now and am pleased enough to buy them again. They aren't perfect- the little tabs that stick up to hold hats are flexible and hats can fall off if used too roughly but that is only happening in my son's room whose bedroom door probably gets flung open harder than necessary. But we have so many hats that there are frequently 2 hats per tab and they still work fine! Am on here to buy another set for my father (we have 4 in our household so far!)
4,eight out of ten$$$$$$$$$$,"I bought this only because it has the great tune from Eyes Wide Shut, the movie starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. It is hauntingly infectious. Took me a while to find the exact version from the movie too. Amazon really helps in that respect, because I could listen to the tracks on the album and verify the correct movie soundtrack tune. Entire album is very good, and I never buy any album for one song, but kinda did that with this one. Don't have any Shostkovich. Trying to wander from my usual faves of Vivaldi, Bach, and other Baroque masters."
1,Slanty eyes tell lies racist cover art means no sale to me.,"""Don't judge a book by its cover"" is a common saying, but what if the cover itself is racist? The title ""Slanted Truths"" implies that an expose of perfidy awaits the reader, while the face of a South East Asian statue indicates the race of the perpetrators.Until the cover art is changed I will not buy this book and I urge others to do likewise."
2,Cheap!,"There original looks like the one pictured here, but the one I received is silver in color, lighter and just feels cheap. If I had it to do over again I would not have made the purchase."
5,Pretty Sturdy,"Got this really for a palm saver for my ramrod, it works perfect used it last night.. It does exactly what I want it to do! Nice and sturdy!"
3,Bounds is good but this collection is too edited...,Words are inserted in this version that change the meaning of certain thoughts and take away from its power. Bounds is still good though - it's just better to get it the way he wrote it. Buy The Complete Works of E.M. Bounds on Prayer published by Baker instead. (That version was also changed to use modern language but definitely compares better than this version.)
4,Err...confusing,"This album is kinda...well...off. This band, like many other kewl ska bands like Save Ferris, are trading in trumpets for guitars, which actually makes me sad. But No Doubt does a great job in doing so. The only thing that pisses me off about this album is that many of the songs are slow and ballad-y. My favorite track is ""Six Feet Under"" in which Stephani and co. try to explore the meaning of life. It sounds awesome! This album is good, but the magic that Tragic Kingdom had...isn't really here!"
4,"The ballads, oh, the ballads...","Gwen Stefani gets on my nerves after a while. Her whiny voice can only be tolerated in small doses. Off their old record, I liked Spiderwebs and that's about it.The new one surprised me. First of all, the songwriting is much improved (though still not stellar). What is most surprising is that the ballads are the strongest part of the record, a nice contrast to the simple-teen anthem ""Don't Speak"". Specifically, ""Simple Kind of Life"" and ""Too Late"" are moving examples of what happens when a pop band moves to the next level. Here's hoping the next record contains more of the same. This is a great progression from their last record and hopefully a starting point for better things to come."
5,No Doubt Is Da Bomb!,"OMG! When I first saw this album I thought that the music would be out of date because their last album was put out when I was in 5th grade (Now going into 9th), but I was so wrong. I had heard Ex-Girlfriend and Simple Kind of Life on the radio and loved it."
4,Very Strong Record,"Wonderful musical textures set the stage for another musical blender that is No Doubt. If you know what No Doubt is all about then there is no need to belabor the point, which is this is just a plain old great record! If you're the kind of person who has to be stuck on a gi-normous radio hit then this may not satisfy as much as Tragic Kingdom, but those of us who appreciate No Doubt for all their other talents will appreciate the new record. More hints of 80's new wave and pop, a bit of ska of course. Make sure to listen for the ""secret"" track at the end of the CD.Highly recommended."
3,Good Bunch of Pop Songs,"I was really looking forward to the disc. The songs are pretty good, it is just not my kind of music. Don't get me wrong, if you are into pop music, get this. It is great. If you are looking for rockers like ""Ex-Girlfriend"" or even the now old ""New"" don't be surprised to find there aren't many on here.Gwen has grown in her lyrics and it really honest. I like that. Her voice has grown, the whole band has. No music fan will dislike this disc. It is a great pop record. just not my cup of tea. . ."
2,"NO, Thank You!!",When did Missing Persons make a comeback??? Oh wait their calling themselves NO DOUBT these days.
1,What about Jupiter?,"More limpit quasi ska bubble gum,From the band whose nads are close to numb,Since most of the tunes are fairly glum,You'll be wishing for a tragic kingdom come.If the quality of the tunes are a cause for dismayThe production values are a-okay.Its the latest trend for bands with nothing to sayJust make sure to say it in a very pretty way."
1,Droning...Whiny...& Lifeless,"Saturn to No Doubt is Celebrity Skin to Hole. At least Hole varied their songwriting. Artificial pop with no depth that belongs on the same shelf as Britney Spears, Ricky Martin and In-Sync. Will you be playing this CD in a few years? Doubt it!I've read all the reviews here and wonder what are looks and pink hair have to do with good music? After all, she said ""Magic's in the Make-up."" Don't be fooled, folks!"
1,THIS CD STINKS!,"When I heard No Doubts new CD was out on Tuesday I was thefirst one to the stores. On Wednesday I was also the first one at thepawn shop. This was supposed to be No Doubts growing up album. It turns out there is a strange growth in the record.... Every song other than Ex-Girlfriend. The biggest disappointment is that although they have one of the best trumpet players out there he gets in on only one song. If you want to listen to a real ""growing up"" album go buy Goldfingers new release ""Stomping GroundD"". If you want music with energy and horns and an awesome female vocalist go buy anything by Save Ferris or The Dance Hall Crashers. Place one of these CD's in and proceed to skank all over The Return Of Saturn. Thanks for nothing No Doubt."
1,HAUNTED BY TRAGIC KINGDOM SHADOW,"Return Of Saturn failed to be a sophomore succesful album, that could stand out in front of ""Tragic Kigdom"", perhaps the music was drowned in a POP atmosphere in the year this sad album came to life, but that was no excuse, this album is full, crowed, with filler cuts, that are no more than anoying, and unworthy to listen, the only good tracks that are saved to become flops are ""Ex-Girlfriend, Bathwater & New"", the rest of the album makes me sick, thank god, they managed to stay signed and make it up with ""Rock Steady"" wich should have been the follow up to ""Tragic""...this album should be skipped...."
1,Same old stuff... depends if your like ska or not. I don't!,"I listened to No Doubt's new CD today in a store. I must admit that I hate ska and I can't stand their music in Tragic Kingdom, but I thought that they would change their style to ajust themselves with current alternative music. But ohh... what a mess. I couldn't say that this CD is really bad, because it isn't, I mean, the production and stuff is great. But the music itself... ahhh it's so awful I can't even describe it. I give at least one star for a song which I forgot the name, but except this one, well, you know what I mean. However, if you fell in love with No Doubt with their last album, I think you'll like this one too. But I really don't, sorry guys!PS: What does ""Return of Saturn"" means anyway?"
2,DISAPPOINTING AT BEST.,"No Doubt comes back on the scene 5 years later from their last effort....and what a disappointment.The only standout songs are ""Ex-Girlfriend"" and ""Simple Kind of Life""....the other songs are just a bashing/thrashing sound of noise.A definite miss....of course the No Doubt fans are going to hate me for this, but I was a fan too, and I felt this album lacked very poorly."
3,Pretty good....not one of my favorites....,"I like this album, but I think Tragic Kingdom is better. Gwen sounds really good....she's got the best voice...I just like their other albums better....Some of my favorites are ""New"" ""Ex-Girlfriend"", ""Bathwater"", ""Simple kind of life"" and ""Six feet under"" Most of my faves are the singles.....I know a lot of No Doubt fans love this album the most, but, It's just not one of my favorites.....But I would recommend it though!"
5,AWESOME,"Ever since the first time I heard ""Just a Girl"" I was hooked on No Doubt. I borrowed ""Tragic Kingdom"" from my friend so many times it got to the point she wouldn't let me anymore. I recently bought ""Return of Saturn"" and I love it. ""New"", ""Bathwater"", ""Staring Problem"", and ""Artifical Sweetner"" (along with of course ""Ex-Girlfriend"") are my fave songs on this album. I recommend it to everyone!"
5,No Doubt about it- they're back!,"Absolutely awesome! This CD hasn't left my CD player since I bought it! The band has branched out from their California ska roots to new and different sounds, and the results are great. Several of the songs, such as ""Bathwater""(my favorite track), ""Artificial Sweetener"" and ""Comforting Lie"", are standouts that should get some radio airplay. If you're missing the old No Doubt, ""New"" and ""Staring Problem"", which is another fun, floor-shaking ska rythym that will remind you of ""Spiderwebs"", are included. Gwen's voice has matured as well, and her lyrics are creative, emotional, and flow well. This isn't the ""Tragic Kingdom"", but ""Saturn"" isn't a bad place to be."
5,Very Well Crafted CD,"No Doubt has certainly continued to mature and grow, both as musicians and as people. You can hear it on this CD. The musicianship in flawless. Gwen's vocals are perfect and they are unique on each song.The one thing that really stands out to me are the lyrics. The lyrics in the booklet read like poetry. Gwen speaks about things that everyone goes through. Especially the female thing. The songs ""Ex-Girlfriend"", ""Simple Kind of Life"" and ""Bathwater"" are written by a very mature and wise women. And they speak to every female.The CD has its ska/pop songs. But it also has its mellow ballads. I don't think its what you would expect from a typical ska band - but it really seems that this ska band is alot older and wiser - and the ballads on this CD are solid and well-written."
3,Good.,"Good, but not great. There's alot of very bland songs in there, particularly the last 8 songs with the exception of New and Home Now.Still, Ex-Girlfriend, A Simple Kind of Life, and Bathwater make this worth the price."
5,Definitely Not Tragic,"This album is not even a close comparison to Tragic Kingdom. It's a much more grown-up version of the band, but focuses mainly on self-realization. The lyrics are much more meaningful and thought provoking, and the beats bend from the ska-genre, to new wave, to 80's style...it's like a roller coaster ride of verses. It will be hard to not have a couple of favorites, like the sugary ""Marry Me"", or harshness of ""Artificial Sweetener"". Even though I was hoping for more of the type of songs from the first album, its nice to hear how they have grown. Gwen rocks - she really pours her heart out - guys might think that a couple of the tracks are ""chick"" songs, but who cares. ""No Doubt"" has made their mark once again."
2,A disappointment...,"I was really looking forward to the release of this cd, but it is not what I expected. Most of the songs are quite slow -- not ballad slow, but whining slow -- and seem to focus on when Gwen will ever be happy with a relationship. Or when will she manage to get married. Please. I'm sure many other women will find this recurring theme irritating. Also, many of the songs are mixed-up musically, with arrangements tossed in that keep the songs from having a real melody. Ex-Girlfriend is catchy, but the rest of the album leaves a lot to be desired. Do your de-evolving a thousand years in therapy and cheer up -- then write your songs. Maybe next time out ""Saturn"" will pass through the ""Tragic Kingdom"" and the results will be more entertaining."
2,ILOOOVE NO DOUBT BUT....,THAT BAND HAS GOT ME THROUGH SOME CRAZY TIMES SO WHEN I FOUND SOMEONE HAD TAKEN MYT RETURN OF SATURN A FEW MONTHS AGO I WONDERED HOW I COULDVE ONE LET IT HAPPEN AND TWO NOT HAVE EVN NOTICED WELL YA'LL THE ALBUM EXCEPTING A FEW AWESOME SONGS THAT DIDNT EVEN HIT THE RADIO THIS ALBUM WAS NOT WHAT IT WAS AND I MEAN THAT AS NICELY AS POSSIBLE I CANT SAY WHAT IT WAS BUT MAYBE THE ENERGY FELT A LITTLE FORCED OR IN SOME CASES NOT EVEN THERE BUT ROCK STEADY TOTALLY MADE UP FOR AND MADE YOU FORGET THE AWFULNESS THAT WAS THIS ALBUM.
2,"Saturn - no deposit, no ""Return...""","So we have an hour of Gwen moaning how lousy love is. Uh, heard it, been there. You did that on the last album, deary, and better. It only gets two stars for some decent musicianship and production. Otherwise, forget it."
1,Return to Stink,"I got the album thinking that the CD was going to rock. It didn't. I was pumped after getting the Go Sound Track and hearing New thinking that they were working on some really good tunes. Instead I get the album and find out that they have sold out. I never thought I would hear so many ballads, but after they banked on don't speak, I see why they got greedy. Buy another album. Don't waste your cash."
1,It really sucked!,"This album is an insult to the word ska. What kind of music are they heading toward now; Britney Spears? It features too much synthesizers and not much brass. Tragic Kingdom and their self-titled album are much better than this. The only songs (that were mediocre at best) were Ex-girlfriend, Staring Problem, and New. This album was poorly compiled."
4,Great CD!,"This CD is awesome. I especially love the song ""Ex-Girlfriend."" If you want to hear some quality music though, you should check out the rap and hip hop culture versus rock. But I still give this 4 stars, if it was compared to Garbage I would give it a 2."
3,Nod to New Wave,"I like this album. It's a nod to great New Wave bands like Missing Persons. Even Gwen's pink hair. Songs like ""Magic's In the Makeup"" and ""Staring Problem"" have the great hooks. And ""Simple Kind of Life"" is just amazing.The big hype about this album was that Gwen turned 30 and was facing adult issues. Well, in her own way she reflects on becoming a woman, but this album isn't really ""deep"". It took me a few listens to appreciate it, but will probably stay in my collection longer also."
3,Their Old Ones R Better,"This cd is pretty good, but i think it is lacking what No Dobut's old cd's had. This one just doesn't seem as good as the other ones. I can't put my finger on exactly what's missing, but i think it's that the songs are slower and lacking in some of the attitude that the other cd's had. But i still liked this cd. I recommend it."
3,I bought this CD on a lark and Liked It,"The colorful, kinetic, and fun video for ""Ex-Girlfriend"" caught my attention and the chorus stuck with me. After months of having the first release stuck in my head, I purchased ""Return of Saturn."" At first, I thought it was a blah ablum until I listened to it again. It's full of tunes about love relationships that went bad and leaves the girl bitter and angry as hell. The uptempo tracks are the best ones and they really grab you, making you slap your chest in recognition. Although it is not as cathartic as Alanis' ""Jagged Little Pill"" or as meditative as Sade's ""Promise,"" ""The Return of Saturn"" makes for great post-break-up, hoorah for being single listening."
3,Sounds like Sheryl Crow,I only like one song (Simple Kind of Life) but it sounds just like Sheryl Crow.What's up with that ?
2,Should of stayed on Saturn!,"I am sorry, but No Doubt's glory years in my view are over. This album is rather primitive when comparing to their fantastic and energetic Tragic Kingdom. Lyrics are OK and music is nothing special. Return of Saturn lacks all the spontaneity and energy that Tragic Kingdom launched and put No Doubt at the top of the charts. It seems as if No Doubt is moving away toward different directions of music of which only lead singer Gwen Stefani seems to be benefitting from. She should do herself a favor and pursue a solo career and leave the other band members on Saturn."
5,There sound is unique and very cool,"All of there songs have excellent lyrics and Gwen Stefani has such an amazing voice. All of there songs mean something and a lot of the songs you can relate too. They are an excellent group and a have a wonderful and unique sound, I would definetly recommend this CD."
4,Awesome cd,"Tragic Kingdom was still a way better cd, but Return of Saturn isn't too bad either... Bathwater and Magic's in the Makeup are the best songs. It's just your normal no doubt sound with Gwen's awesome voice. Nothing spectacular. but still a great cd"
5,No Doubt Matures in an amazing album!,"Well this ablum is much more mature than the last one. The ballads have more heart in them (thanks to Gavin)and everything is just a little more mellow. But that dosen't make it any less amazing that the first album! Gwen once again stretches out her beautiful voice and gives us a great album. All the songs are great, I can't pick a bad one out of the bunch. No Doubt has once again come back strong. I reccomend this album to any No Doubt fan!"
2,BOR-ING!!!,"What a waste of talent!! No Doubt's fourth offering is nothing but pop-fodder and ""feel sorry for me 'cause I'll never be normal"" lyrics. The only song on here that is good is the first one-""Ex-Girlfriend"". This is a typical No Doubt song with the ska sound firmly in place. Other songs are dreary ballads (""Too Late"" is actually pretty good, though) and pop-like songs more intended for someone like, maybe Alanis Morissette (I could hear Alanis singing ""Bathwater""). The songs ""Magic's In The Makeup"" and ""Simple Kind Of Life"" are the ""feel sorry for me"" lyrics and make the album depressing and somewhat whiny. Gwen Stefani and Co. can find better songs than this. Stick with the first 3 albums if you like No Doubt. I hope their next album goes back to the ska sound. Not a ""Return Of Saturn""; more like an ""Error Of Judgement""."
5,Great,Brand new. Great quality. Fast ddelivery.. The quality of the.sound was great. I love No Doubt and this cd is great. I listen to it continously.
4,Great Cd!!!,"I don't think comparing this cd to it's past ones is fair. I think this cd is really great. I had to get it before I went on vacation. But still something is bugging me a bit, it isn't very ska. They pride themselves on being ska, and yet there cd doesn't sound very ska to me. Where is the trumpets? It is still a great cd. Probably my favorite in my cd collection right now. I think it deserves 4 stars, it is wonderful, but missing the ska feel and style. Over all it is a great cd!!!"
4,Good cd,This is my 2nd favorite No Doubt cd. It's got a lot of different kinds of music. Like Ex-Girlfriend has kind of that latin taste to it combined with rock while Bathwater is a song like you would hear on an earlier No Doubt cd. I think that No Doubt has really evolved into a great band over the years. New is what I think to be a rock song...I really like this song. It's definatly different and has energy and good lyrics. Another song with good lyrics is Too Late...another one of my favorites. I would say that this cd is worth the money. Any No Doubt fan should get it.
1,why bother,"I will never understand how this group got off the ground. Each new song of theirs grates on me from start to finish, and Gwen Stefani's pouting, hiccupy voice makes me cover my ears and grit my teeth in pain. I was forced to listen to this album by a friend and it was no different from the rest. I'd rather go to the dentist and listen to muzac: at least those people don't pretend to be ""way cool."""
2,An Emotional Estrogen Skirt-Fest!,"Return to Saturn received rave reviews by critics everywhere. I honestly don't understand why. Saturn's singles are subpar compared to Tragic Kingdom. ""Ex-Girlfriend"" is average at best. ""New"" has a good chorus line (""Don't let it go away...""), but the rest of the song just isn't interesting. Nearly every song on the album (except maybe ""Bathwater,"" ""Simple Kind of Life,"" and ""Six Feet Under"") are far from exciting. Most songs deal with Gwen's female-problems including wanting to be married, wanting children, her insecurities, blah blah blah. Maybe you got to be a girl to appreciate this album. Let's just say Return to Saturn isn't exactly going to put hair on your chest."
2,Return Of Gwen,1. Ex-Girlfriend 4/52. Simple Kind of Life 2/53. Bathwater 4/54. Six Feet Under 5/55. Magics in the Makeup 1/56. Artificial Sweetener 4/57. Marry Me 1/58. New 5/59. Too Late 1/510. Comforting Lie 4/511. Suspension Without Suspense 3/512. Staring Problem 3/513. Home Now 1/514. Dark Blue 1/5
1,Didn't make it out of the CD case,"I purchased this CD, and then realized, what was I doing? Where was I? Why was I here? This slow and steady realization led me to the fact that listening to this CD, or is it a CD? Could it be some fanction of our imagination playing games on us? Therefore, this lead me to refund my money for this CD."
2,no doubt that it blows,"well, what can i say, i guess some of the songs were okay, but tragic kingdom was much much better by comparison, i loved the upbeat sound on that one and return of saturn just brought me down. i was disappointed to hear the endless ballads on this. take my word for it, tragic kingdom is a much better investment."
2,"NO, Thank You!!",When did Missing Persons make a comeback??? Oh wait their now calling themselves NO DOUBT these days.>
3,No Doubt's 'Return',"No Doubt's newest album 'Return of Saturn' doesn't really get any better than it's first track. ""Ex-Girlfriend"" is a splendidly furious rock shocker. It takes you up so high for about 3 minutes, and then as the rest of the album travels on through mostly mediocre ska-rock confections you descend slowly into a slight sense of disappointment. It doesn't compare with the much superlative 'Tragic Kingdom'. Albeit, Gwen's vocals here are still strong and the band seems to be having the time of their life. Overall, there's alot of fluidity missing on the new album...it seems to be all about the sound not the lyrics. My advice: listen to tracks 2 through 14 first and track 1 last. :-)"
3,Return of No Doubt.,"My favorite No Doubt album. Their best album cover too, but then again I'm a sucker for girls with pink or red hair. I remember when this came out I bought the double vinyl. Then I bought another one for a few bucks. Now it's selling used for $50. Anyway...great songs. ""Ex-girlfriend"" and ""Simple Kind Of Life"" are two of my fave songs of theirs ever. ""New"" rocks, and is also on the cool ""Go"" soundtrack. Another good track with a message is ""Magic's In The Makeup"". The rest here is all fun. This album has almost no trace of their past ska influences, but fine with me. Enjoy!"
5,No Doubt -- Return of Saturn.......,"This is a great cd! Congrats No Doubt on a job well done. Simple Kind of Life is my fav right now, but they are all great songs,,,,,,, Best of luck No Doubt!"
5,No Doubt soars in this one!,"When I bought the album, I will say I was initially disappointed with the sound. The songs did not seem to have quite the catchiness of my favorite No Doubt album, the ""Beacon Street Collection"", nor of its predecessor, the immensely popular ""Tragic Kingdom"". However, I soon realized that I was in fact, mistaken. It had been so long since I first heard a ND song for the first time, I forgot that it takes a couple times through the CD before you really pick up on how good it really is. Eventually you find songs stuck in your head and you really start to enjoy singing along with what in reality are VERY catchy songs. The songs are all deep and strong, and closer to the bands roots than TK was. Overall, great release, worthy of the wait."
4,Little too tragic but they return to rule the kingdom,"Really, this should be rated 3.5 stars. A very good disc that is not quite up to the level of Tragic Kingdom. The anger at every guy feel of Kingdom has given way to the naked anger at oneself that permeates Gwen's lyrics. Ex Girlfriend,Six Feet Under, and New are the logical extensions of the hyper grrl sounds of Tragic. With the countryish Simple Kind Of Life, No Doubt may have written their best tune yet while Gwen successfully wades into Stevie Nicks territory with Magic's In the Makeup. The horn happy Old Bathwater is their one daring exploratory tune akin to Tragic's discoy You Can Do It. The one complaint is the album is a tad too ballad heavy as it seemed the pressure of writing another Don't Speak got to them. Nevertheless, this is a more than solid disc that should be the top rock seller until the arrival of Binaural on 5/6. One last question: How does Gavin feel if Gwen is still obsessed with Kanal?"
5,"""no doubt"" that this cd rocks!","No Doubt that this cd totally rocks! It's very different from the old ND stuff, but this new stuff is still very good. No doubt's last cd Tragic Kindom is what fans are probably used to- fast, quick wit lyrics and rythems are what you will find [also] on this and last cd. This new cd ""return of satern"" contains very fast ""whap"" songs from ""Ex-girl friend"" to almost ""ballads like"" songs such as ""marry me"" to the almost haunting mood of ""dark blue"". The best songs (in my opinion) would definitely be ""ex girlfriend"" and my second fave (still in my opinion) ""magics in the makeup"". This is an excellent cd, and a big time ""must get"" for all No Doubt fans. Come on, they're back!"
2,This cd isn't that great,"I actually didn't like this album, I really admire this band, but i only like 5 of it's tracks, and those aren't that much great, Ex-girlfriend, Simple Kind of Life, Bathwater, New, and Comforting Lie is the ones i find OK, the rest is weird-style punk, some slow ska-punk and girlish imitation of punk(ex #4) if you are going for this album, please buy another one, don't waste your money"
4,This one unfairly got a bad rep,"I like No Doubt a lot too, and this album was different than the others. However, I still liked it a great deal. It's a good breakup CD to listen to, if nothing else. Definitely worth it, if only for the angst value."
4,No Doubt RETURNS with Return of Saturn,"Return of Saturn is an excellant CD. I personally expected this CD to lack the edge heard on Tragic Kingdom but No Doubt proved me wrong and released a solid ska/punk/rock cd. Hit singles "" Ex Girlfriend"" and ""Simple Kind Of Life"" are excellantly written and appeal to a wide range of listeners. Songs like ""Bathwater"", ""New"","" Too Late"" and "" Marry Me"" are some of my favorites on the CD. If you are a No Doubt fan this cd is a must for your collection."
5,Great! Awesome! Amazing!,"Those are just a few words that describe the new album. If u liked the 80's,this cd's for u. It's got a whole new 80's sound that will blow u off your feet. It's unlike any No Doubt cd. It's as if they take a little bit of all forms of music and come out with a great new sound. But, if u don't beleive me go out buy the cd and if your as big a fan of No Doubt as I am u will love it!"
3,Very Active Album,"This album is the bomb. I gotta give it up to No Doubt for this great follow up to Tragic Kingdom. Usually when artists achieve such strataspheric success with one album they tend to tapper off, but not No Doubt, they just continue on innovating and elevating the So Cal pop/rock/ska sound. My favorite songs on the album are ""Magic's In The Makeup"" (even though I like the non-album version better), ""Bathwater"" (love the lyrics and her vocals), ""Simple Kind of Life"" (one of my favorite songs for the summer and fall of 2000). Well that's about it, later."
5,The Return of No Doubt,"No Doubt's RETURN OF SATURN is my favorite cd now... along with TRAGIC KINGDOM, of course. The feelgood beats of songs like ""Bathwater"" are probably my favorite thing about this album. The hidden tracks are a little treat also. On my cd I have a instrumental version of ""Too Late"". The kind of people that i WOULD NOT recommend this album to are teeny boppers that think a group should wear sexy outfits and write sweet little love songs to please people. No Doubt is a unique band that has their own style. RETURN OF SATURN is for people who accept the different and like songs that put them in a good mood. This won't be their first cd to go platinum, or the last."
2,I expected more,"I love No Doubt, but this album... I expected more... yes substance is good, talking about deeper things, but I only listen to ""ex girlfriend"" and ""Go"". This album just doesn't cut it for me. This album is like a downer. Too sad."
4,wonderful cd!,"I think that this is an excellent CD... actually very different from Tragic Kingdom, I think. This CD didn't have the influence of Eric Stefani, who was no longer a band member at this point, and I think that the sound is interesting. It isn't my very favorite from No Doubt, but I do adore it."
5,Love it!,"I don't really consider myself a fan of No Doubt's earlier stuff, but I find this CD totally enjoyable. It's total chick music, it's all about Gwen, of course her heartbreak over her failed relationship with bassist Tony, her nervous feelings about her new relationship with Gavin, her insecurities about turning 30 and not being married or having kids. The four band members seem to have such great chemistry...they definitely make great music together!!! Buy this CD, you will not be disappointed."
2,?,"The only truly good song on this CD is #1 X-Girlfriend! That song has a good beat. I bought all of No Doubt's prior CD's to this one, I don't really like any of their songs besides, Excuse Me Mr. Just A Girl, and X-Girlfriend. I wouldn't call No Doubt untalented, the guys CAN play music, even if it did sound like the Circus was coming to town on Tragic. On this CD, the Circus sound does not show up much. Gwen is very pretty, it is true, but I can't believe that people are going out to buy No Doubt's albums because she is lovely. I would like to say that Gwen can't sing, but that wouldn't be true, because she can sing, she just does NOT sound good to me! The songs on this album are so slow! The album loses speed after the #1 song!"
2,"NO, Thank You!!",When did Missing Persons make a comeback??? Oh wait their now calling themselves NO DOUBT these days.
1,This is what I waited for?,"O.k. I'm 33 years old, which probably makes me the oldest No Doubt fan in the world. But I loved Tragic Kingdom. I think it's one of the best albums of the 90's (not saying much) with influences from ska to hardcore to salse.But the entirety of Return to Saturn is like the last two songs on Tragic Kingdom -- just kind of there, with no real purpose. These songs just drone on without really doing anything. There's no energy, no creativity and no substance.I'm disappointed."
2,"Music: not ""Tragic"" enough; Lyrics: Almost Insufferable","I gave this band a try with Tragic Kingdom, which actually made me buy ""Beacon Street."" So today (4/11/2000) I bought ""Saturn.""Probably a lot of girls will relate to it and like it, because it's like a lyrcized version of a girl's diary. This band really needs to rename itself something like ""Gwen and the Disposables"" or maybe ""Blondie 2000."" It seems to be all about her. On the last album there was fun and interesting stuff like ""Tragic Kingdom"" and ""Different People.""If Gwen wants to get married and have kids, she could easily do it. Madonna does it all the time. Gwen doesn't really want that. Maybe because marriage and family songs don't sell. Misery does."
2,No Doubt an Alanis Morissette spin-off?,Gwen Stefani continues an age of whiny women singers (Alanis Morissette). The lyrics are so-so and the music is a little bit better. The song 'Ex-Girlfriend' is extreamly repetitive. This CD is tolarable but not recomeneded execept for hardcore Alanis fans.
5,the right next step,"no, this is not tragic kingdom revisited, this is the perfect follow up to that awesome disc. gwen is my girl, and she and the boys prove that they are more than a ""one commercial hit wonder""(""don't speak""), they're talented artists and musicians. this is a powerful and compelling piece of work. go head NO DOUBT, FOREVER!"
5,A previous review said it best with bittersweet.,"I bought this cd the first day it came out and have listened to it practically non-stop since. I just have to say that this not just a estrogen fest. These songs deal with issues such as pain, lonliness, adhereing to tradition. Not only that they play with new musical styles while keeping thier ska-ish backbeat roots. I think the lyrics are powerful and moving."
4,pretty good album,"I thought this album was pretty good! I don't like the last 2 tracks on the Cd, but the rest is pretty cool! Gwen's voice is much softer this time, and she sings beautifully! The lyrics are awesome as usual. I do like ""Tragic kingdom"" alot more for some reason. It's like this album is too ""soft-pop"" at times. It's not too heavy like in ""Tragic kingdom"" or ""the Beacon street collection"". I love the best is ""new"" and ""ex-girlfriend"" and ""Artificial Sweetener"" Those are the best in this album!"
5,"Though the music's different,it's still GREAT!","I bought the new No Doubt album and I simply LOVE it! I have to admit that they've changed their music a little. It's not the same as ""Tragic Kingdom"" but hey,they still totally rock! :) IMO,they're as good as ever! I love all the songs in the album! This is a must buy for ALL No Doubt fans out there!"
5,No Doubt you should get it!,"While Tragic Kingdom was a fun CD, Return Of Saturn retains the fun and also allows for expansion and maturity. The ska doesn't overwhelm the music as much as it did on Tragic Kingdom, yet there are still touches of it on the beautiful ""Marry Me."" Expect different reggae grooves on other great ballads like ""Magic's In The Makeup"" (great writing also there, with Gwen in reflection on herself,) and ""Home Again."" Harder songs like ""Ex-Girlfriend,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" and ""New"" have more of an alternative/punk feel than before, but melody is not lost. ""Staring Problem"" injects some controlled humor. It also has an explosive chorus like ""Ex-Girlfriend."" ""Bathwater"" and ""Comforting Lie"" effectively use thumping percussion. Complementing the good material is more strong vocals from Gwen (In my opinion, her best moment is on the part of ""Magic's In The Makeup"" where she goes makeup's off, who am I? Classic singing there."
2,"Blades are great, but knife stinks!","If you try putting any pressure on this knife while pulling it along something, like cutting through drywall, the blade will pull right out on you! Happens repeatedly. It is a real pain in the butt after you have to keep putting the blade back in all the time. Works fine if you don't apply much pressure. After long uses of hard gripping, plastic will chafe your skin away also. But the blades are great, I love those. I will buy these blades again for my other utility knives. For a good knife, try to find the silver and black Rhino brand knife, which has a thin soft rubber grip on it, then use these Irwin blades in it."
1,Be close to an emergency room,"This knife stinks, not only does the blade pull out (noted in other reviews) but STORING the blades in the handle is a NIGHTMARE. Inside the handle is a springy clip, if you try to squeeze more than 1 or2 blades in there Watch Out! What in the blue hell was Irwin thinking? They must have stock in suture material. It does have a great look though and a great rubber grip. I was very disappointed."
4,Wow! What a great knife!,"After reading the other comments, I'm compelled to take a stand for my favorite knife! Although the in-handle storage is quite tight, I've never experienced the blades pulling out (even when cutting dry wall). I find this knife very useful and am quite satistifed with my purchase! And, my spring-loaded quick entry still works and is my favorite feature of this knife. Thanks Irwin!"
3,Seems okay to me,"I've been using this knife for about a year and have never had a blade pull out. I like the design and it feels very sturdy, although I've seen knives I like better since then. One problem I've noticed is that blade storage inside the hanlde is pretty horrible. It has a clip that comes with about 5 blades in it. The tension on the clip is incredibly strong though so you almost need to take the blades out with a pair of pliers. Forget about trying to get one back in there if you need to. Very dangerous."
4,Do You Want More,"""Do You Want More"" is an artist album that showcases all of the many facets of Robbie Rivera's remixes and productions that we have heard in recent years. However, what makes this album unique is Rivera's ability to incorporate different styles of music into his own unique genre, thus bridging the gap between various styles of music. In a time when many dance tracks sound similar, Rivera goes the distance and tries something new... and as a result succeeds brilliantly."
4,Handy,"Very handy to use around the shop or house. I keep one in my camper, and one in my work toolbox."
3,10 in one,"I don't like the quality of this product, the inserts tend to break, but I needed a 10-in-1, so I purchased it. I wish some other manufacturer made the same options available."
2,Klein 10 in 1 screwdriver,"I really like my Klein tools, However,I am on my 3rd Klein 32477 10-in-1 Screwdriver/Nut Driver because the screwdriver tips fall out and becoeme lost.I have to keep electrical tape wrapped around them,which becomes tiresome.I would think Klein would address this problem because it is definietly an issue. I sent an e mail to their quality assurance department in hopes they will redesign and improve this product."
4,Great multi-purpose screwdriver,"This is probably one of the most used tools, on my belt. It has nut drivers, multiple tips, and just about anything you want to use, in a jiff. My only complaint is that the 5/16"" nut driver does not like to be torqued too much, and warps. Once this occurs, you have a hard time keeping the 1/4"" bit sleeves on, when reversed. It's not a huge deal, and is only slightly annoying. I wouldn't recommend using the nut drivers for too many repeated high hand torque turns. I'd recommend a dedicated Klein nutdriver, if you torque quite hard.All in all, this is my tool of choice, to start any job."
3,A little too specialized,Bought this and a set of Klein driver bits. But the driver uses bits that have a bearing to grab inside the shaft and are a lot longer. I'll keep it but I had to order a Whia magnetic bit driver for the Klein bit set.
3,A little disappointed with Klein,"I use Klein tools everyday, and they're top notch. Although, I have to say I'm disappointed this tool the tips don't lock in the shank that well and tend fall out when torquing on screws. The 5-in-1, is a much better driver for the money."
3,Expected more.,"When I first purchased the driver, I did so to replace a so-called inferior product, sold at harbor freight. Right away, I noticed the similarities between the two. The differences, to me, made the Klein more difficult to use. The main difference I'd like to mention was the size of the driver bits and how difficult they are to get in and out of the driver. Near impossible to do with one hand. I'm also finding that the driver doesn't fit in as many places as I'd like due to the shaft length being too short. Sell me a 10-in-one that is about three inches longer with bits that are twice as long, and you will have a superior product."
1,Get the 5 in one. Trust me.,Get the 5 in one. Trust me. Or you'll use the bits out of this thing within a day.
3,It's OK product.,"When I use it first time I noticed my hair were flat, no volume. Then I try it again and results were better. I think I used to much of leave in conditioner that day.I will finish the product but won't buy it again."
4,Choir music is great!,"I bought this disc for some of the songs. I love the way the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sings. I love the choir arrangements of folk songs, spirituals and other songs. It is a joy to listen to and lifts my spirits up and sparks my curiosity about some of the words they sing to the songs I am familiar with. I can't always understand all the verses but I understand the feeling that comes with the songs. I love this disc and the others that I own. They are great to listen to."
2,Broke very easily,"As all the positive reviews note, it is a great product in every way as far as I can tell... except that it broke in no time, even though it was used gently and very infrequently. The crank just flat out stopped working, after maybe 3 uses... As I said, we were careful with it and didn't handle it roughly. You just turn the crank, so I can't see any way to mess it up... Perhaps this was just one defective unit... In any case, for what we paid, it shouldn't break so easily."
5,The Thrill of Adventure,"Build a keelboat, learn how to use a compass, carve a canoe - all of these adventures await you in The Lewis & Clark Expedition! Terrific book which makes the Expedition come alive. The activities and illustrations are excellent and have proven to be winners with children of all ages."
4,"More band, less Rhett","There are few better experiences in the music universe than the Old 97s live. I have seen them several times and every show has been wonderful. This DVD is a good presentation of a March 2004 show in LA. Most of their fan favorites are here but, sadly, 'Barrier Reef' is not included. The sound quality, with a dolby 5.1 choice offered, is excellent and the video quality is superb. My only minor complaint is that there are way too many close-ups of Rhett and not enough shots of the whole band in action. Overall this DVD is a great choice for fans and a good alternative for people who like the music but have never seen them live. Buy it, you'll like it!"
2,Great Music; Horrible DVD!,Most people writing reviews for this DVD are focusing on the music and performances which I agree are great BUT unfortunately the DVD which I am reviewing was lousy. The editing was extremely ridiculous. You would be hard-pressed to find an instance of an image that lasted more than a second. It was more like 5 per second (OK that may be a slight--VERY SLIGHT-- exaggeration). This a trend in concert video editing that is evident here in the nth degree. Terrible! The images come at you like a machine gun. Please support this band by buying their CDs but unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old on speed skip this DVD.
5,A Fitting Display of the Greatest Band of All Time,"No experience can replicate seeing the greatness of the Old 97's live, but this DVD is a fitting portrayal. The venue and camera angles were great, and the editing was crisp and fit the flow of each song. I would have loved for the sound to have picked up more of the crowd to help bolster the energy that the band puts out, but all in all I loved it completely. And best of all, my five-year-old prefers it to watching cartoons!"
3,Lacks Power (Not my favorite mix),"I was turned on to these guys recently and love To Far to Care, Fight Songs, and Satellite Rides as well as Rhetts solo album. I also had the great pleasure of seeing them live at the 2005 Bonaroo festival and they ROCKED! I immediately bought this live DVD for my collection. I was mildly dissapointed. The song selection is good, especially the acoustic numbers (""valentine"" and ""question""). The power of the live performance I saw, however, was missing. The guitars and raw manic energy seemed to be mixed to the back and the vocals pushed forward, which makes the 21 song set run long. Whether it was the broken AC at the venue or merely the sound they were looking for for the live record I do not know. But the Old 97's missed the chance to release an awesome rock performance."
2,Key Strategies for Plant Improvement,"Very little new info. Other books also keep repeating same thing.TPS From an Industrial Eng' Viewpoint and SMED are the only two Shingo books needed.Everything else is repetition.Update: 2/24/10. I just received Fundamentals Principles of Lean Manufacturing, by Shingo. It's a hard read due to the writing and labels Shingo placed on the lean tools, principles but, I think it's a very good book for the practitioner. Similar to OHNO's books; requires the student to do shop floor activity and capture their own learning. Then the book has more meaning and will help codify our own learning.thanks to the publisher."
4,Cute Country Songs for Kids,"If you've got a little one who likes country, good or bad, this is a great CD and even though it was used was in perfect condition. Nice classic songs - kids singing so not too annoying!"
4,Gentle and Sweet :-),"This CD is a collection of the most well-known violin pieces. Josh played most of them very well, but I especially love his interpretation of Massenet's Meditation (better than Mutter's and most other violinists' versions). Josh is so gentle and melancholy, and he can completely express the mixed feelings of Thais in the opera. On the other hand, his performance of Sarasate's Zigeunerweisen seems too slow and weak. I definitely think that Gil Shaham's version is better."
1,Not Good,"Sound is not very good... The pieces are also not the best recorded... Do yourself a favor, buy Neveu's recording of Tzigane"
4,WHITE LION ALBUMS,"This is a White Lion album with original demo versions of the classics, but also has new tracks never before heard on previous studio albums and along with the album 'Remembering White Lion' which is new versions of the classic songs, are the first albums since 'Mane Attraction' that offer something new and a little different.Looking forward to a new album with lead singer Mike tramp continuing White lion with new band members, he has reffered to it as White lion 2."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I really like White Lion, and bought this as an MP3 download because I wanted some songs that are not on the greatest hits album. While not a total waste of money, I am extremely disappointed. As almost every review points out this is a RAW album. I wish I read the full album description before purchasing."
3,Microphone cable,"Kinda hard to get worked up about reviewing a cable. It works. Probably my imagination, but the connector seems to be a little loose in the microphone socket. For now it works and I'm happy. First time it doesn't work and I'll use to tie the amps down in the back of the truck."
2,Window screen repair tool,"This item was a real disappointment. It was not at all what I thought it would be, it was mis-represented to look like a wooden handle on the screen and it is all plastic.I will have to find another one of better quality, this is to cheaply made. Not made for long live and derability. I think the company has soom good products you are better off buying a better tool."
3,Its not what I expected to be,"I was not impressed at all with this album.If you like Trance music, check out Schiller or Blank & Jones."
2,Almost Obsolete,"Most of the URLs and principles mentioned in the book went back to 2000, and they are no longer valid. I feel that an update is needed. It does have many great ideas, and the book is easy to read. Hope to see a new edition soon."
2,silica,Was a little disappointed with this item. Did not notice anything helpful. Did not benefit me at all. Honestly could not recommend anyone purchasing this item. I did use only one bottle. Not sure ifcontinued use may have brought on different results.
2,Not the best,"Mounting it was easy. The means of holding the flag good(will not fly off)but very disappointed in two items. (1) the ball on the top. It fits into the pole but has no way of securing it in place. Placing the ring that holds the flag near the top to squeeze the ball in the hollow pole doesn't work. I ended up gluing it in place or would easily loose this. (2) the rings that hold the flag. They come with a protective plastic poly between the ring and the pole. When you remove it and tighten the ring it does not grasp the pole and falls down. If you leave the plastic in place, it holds it in the spot you wish. But the plastic poly will deterioate after time. Tightening the screw on the ring all the way does not solve the problem. Maybe something was missing in my item."
2,Great as a kid,"I originally read this when I was sixteen and thought it was great. Becoming a movie buff later, this a plain rip-off of Orson Wells' Mr. Arkadin (And so was X-Men :The Hellfire Club). If you don't believe me, see the movie!"
3,"OK, but","Interesting, if for no other reason than to hear Handel performed as through he were writing in the era of Bellini and Donizetti. Sutherland was better in the earlier Boult version. The accents of the mezzo and tenor can be a little distracting. The soloists' ornamentation is interesting on a first hearing, but can be a little offputting with continued exposure. As an example, listen to Tourangeau's singing of ""Thou art gone up on high"". Almost every note is filigreed. It reminds me of Callas' caution to a participant in the Julliard master classes: you'd have more impact with expression than all that hullaballoo."
3,An enjoyable listen.,"I won't go into a long discussion of plot here - that information is readily available elsewhere. I enjoyed listening to Joyce Bean read this work. She does a good job with all the various voices for a wide variety of ages. I listened to an unabridged version, so feel that I didn't miss anything. Between her presentation and the book itself, my attention didn't wander and I wanted to get back in the car to find out what was going to happen next. A good combination for someone as new to audio books as I am."
4,Not as good as the others,"I thought this one dragged a bit, but I still like Mary Logue's writing and the characters."
4,Great Recording.,"I reeally enjoyed listening to these CD's. Particularly the 5th and 7th. Mahler's 3rd was wonderful yet not as magical as the Levine recording with the same group. All in all however, I thouhgt that this was by far the best compilation of Mahler's Symphonies."
3,Good buy,"This set is great because it is inexpensive, and the recordings are generally very good. While none of these are the definitive recordings of the symphonies, they will all suffice. The symphonies 1, 5, 6, and especially 9 in this set are all good recordings, and they make it worth it. Solti has a tendency to take this works extremely fast, so the Mahler purist may find them a little different. The other symphonies have their moments, but in general they are fairly sloppy and a buyer could do much better."
3,Let's ride roughshod over Mahler,"Solti made himself a national hero in England and a media star in Chicago, ensuring two decades of rave reviews despite the occasional acknowledgement that he persistently drove the music. He made spectacular recordings of Mahler judged by execution and sonics, but in truth he lacked the depth that Mahler's music demands.In its day, these CSO readings sold very well for Decca, given the spectacular virtuosity of the orchestra, but Solti can't help himself--he is a driven, unsubtle conductor who approaches every symphony in a coarse, sometimes frenzied manner. Mahler conducting has come a long way since then...and had come a long way before then, to think aobut it. I am not a fan of any of these performances, particularly the blatant Second and Eighth -- both famous, high-profile recordings at the time -- but if pressed, I'd rate Solti as best in the First, Third, Fourth, fifth, and Seventh."
2,"Nice, but there's better out there","Sorry folks, but as much as I love Solti, and I agree that the Chicago Symphony is the greatest orchestra in the world, I can't really recommend this set, even at the bargain price. Yes, Solti does deserve his spot among the great Mahlerians; his Mahler's Eighth is arguably the best available, and I do get a guilty pleasure from his Second. Still, Solti only captures half of Mahler's world at best; he has little sensitivity for the reflective and delicate emotional aspects of Mahler's music. In all fairness, no single boxed-set of Mahler's symphonies by any one conductor adequately captures the whole of Mahler's music; perhaps Kubelik's comes closest. At any rate, before you declare yourself a Solti/Mahler die-hard, give a listen to Horenstein's Third, Barbirolli's Fifth, and Bernstein's Ninth with the Berlin Philharmonic (not the Vienna Philharmonic). You owe yourself a listen to the very best of Mahler."
5,Great resource,What a terrific book reviewing one of the greatest aircraft ever. This is a must for any serious aviation buff who knows anything about this aircraft. It has been my go to and for many others with recent events wit the two flying Lancasters in the world. Great book.
3,READ/RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY!!!,"Any potential buyers or interested fans should know that the tracklist for this item, the information provided by amazon, is incorrect. This single does not, repeat: does NOT, have 15 tracks. The correct tracklisting is provided by the seller of a used ""new"" copy. In fact, it is: 1. Sound of the Underground, 2. Stay Another Day, 3. Sound of the Underground (Remix). If you need further proof, look up Girls Aloud on wikipedia, and the page will provide information concerning the tracks on the single for Sound of the Underground Pt. 2."
2,Not as expected,"Purchasing this album was a complete mistake. Personally, I listen to all kinds of stuff so i'm not too niche into one particular type of songs. I first heard GirlsAloud's ""life got cold"" and got an immediate hook up with the lyrics and the music itself. then i heard ""sounds of the undergroud"", and thought it was pretty fine. so without a moment of hesitation i bought the album. but as i played it, sadly, i realized that the songs' similarity was quite obvious, plus, the worthy songs are only the two i've mentioned above. the rest of them simply aren't as good and catchy. so if you aren't interested in teensy pop songs and pointless stuff, please don't lay your hands on this piece of record.lastly, even though i don't like girls aloud, i have to admit that the girls have relatively good voices than most of the pop teen band out there."
5,Husband is very happy,"Print quality is very good & this looks very nice in our Mud Room/ real family entrance, This is a classic for those that love the West"
1,Money replaced the music,"Why doing it to the Canadian band ""Guess who""? Why doing it to rockers around the world who liked the original ""American woman""? Why making a 'whiter shade of pale' cover version to a classic? I tell you why. Money. Since his last good album ""Circus"", Lenny Kravitz looks to me like a musician that cares more about his shows in the MTV and his fashion style, then the music he does. So somewhere on the way to the bank, Kravitz lost his music. So 0 stars for ""American woman"", and 1 star for the whole single, because of the live version of ""Fields of joy"", that reminds us, that there is another Lenny Kravitz, who deals with music."
1,"Kravitz's ""American Woman"": Stay away from it...","The Guess Who's original version of this song puts Lenny Kravitz's entirely derivative ""cover"" to shame. The one saving grace (what the solitary star represents) of the single is that Heather Graham looks pretty damn good in the video."
2,Not for beginners,"This book, while comprehensive in the number aspects of each theory which it covers, is not for beginners. Its explanations leave wide gaps in understanding and are not particularly clear or thorough. It explains the major concepts of each theory but often fails to adequately link some concepts to the body of the theory. Using this book successfully in a classroom setting would require a great deal of supportive material for the students or a ""fill-in"" lecture for each chapter by the teacher in order to explain the concepts which Drs James and Gilliand breeze over."
5,"Truly amazing, full of revelations!","This is a great book. I was turned onto it by the Jesus is Alive Ministry. It's full of great revelations including; ""Which came first, the chicken or, the egg?"", awesome poems that will really get you back to the presence of the Lord, powerful letters written to newspapers, and, super bible studies to strengthen your faith and your walk with Jesus Christ. A real eye opener. Check it out. Recommended!"
3,A Well Meaning Endeavor From Lifetime Takes On Racism And The Importance Of A Good Disc Jockey,"From 2006, this well meaning tale is Lifetime's foray into race relations. It has a good story and an important message, to be sure, but it pushes a few too many obvious buttons. Raven-Symone plays a young woman who fights to bring together two racially divided proms with the aid of a local reporter (Aisha Tyler). While I always love Tyler, I'm not sure that she should have been a focal point in this piece as it takes away from those students actually affected by what's going on. Based on a true story, I think you'll know exactly where this story is headed at all times. But still, it's a nice effort about a genuinely interesting topic. KGHarris, 7/12."
5,"I love ""Sango Splash""!","I purchased this when I bought 2 sets of the ""Sango Splash"" dinnerware, the completer set, mixing bowls, etc.I use this lasagna bowl often. You don't have to wait to use it for lasagna! I use mine to make baked chicken, baked pork chops, stuffed chicken breasts, etc. It is so durable, that you don't need to worry about it breaking or scratching. I know lots of sets advertise that they are. I've owned some of them - and they broke. These are the real deal.Buy them and enjoy!"
1,If you like gun reviews...,"...then this is the book for you. If you actually want to learn anything about cowboy shooting beyond shooting tests of some of the guns, then it's not. If you're looking for info on how to actually do the sport, then I'd strongly suggest trying Scotty Anderson's book instead. Shucks, Mike Venturino's article in ""Popular Mechanics"" about 5 years ago was more informative on the actual sport than this book..."
4,good book for process engineers,"This is a pretty interesting book as it has step by step instructions and guidelines for implementing the CMM up to level 3. If your organization is in a chaotic mode, here is a good place to start to see what to fix first. Also includes a set of example policies and procedures which can be modified to fit your needs."
4,Soothie bottles,These bottles are great!The reason for the 4 stars is because they do leak if the cover isn't on right and size of the bottle is odd. They come in 5 & 9oz sizes. I use powdered formula so you can't make an odd numbered amount. (Too much or too little formula isn't good for the baby's brain development so it's best to use the full scoop rather than half to make odd numbered ounces. At least that's what I was told by my doctor! :) The starter set comes in a 5oz size but now that my son drinks 6ozs I can't really use the 5oz bottles unless I measure 6oz of water in another bottle then transfer it. It's a hassle since 6oz almost reaches the top so when placing the powder in it sometimes spills.Other than that...I love these bottles!
1,These bottles suck,"Do not waste your money! These bottles will leave you with your bundle of joy up all night SCREAMING in tummy pain. These bottles are the worst ever!!! I bought the entire set and they all ended up in the trash. The only ""good"" thing about them are the cups that store formula, so those were the only things I kept. I replaced them with Dr. Browns which I would give 5 stars."
4,Good Bottles,"Over-all these are pretty good bottles. The only thing that I feel could use some improvement is the shape of the top of the bottle, it's a little bit too wide. Example: When you get to end of feeding and have to tilt the bottle upward to get the last 1/2 ounce or so, the base of the nipple is actually touching babies nose.Other than that, these are GREAT bottles. They are resonably priced, never had any problems w/ leaking & absolutely LOVE that cap snaps onto bottom of bottle, GENIUS!"
3,My son cannot latch on.,I cannot give these bottles 5 stars. I like them...but my son does not. My favorite feature is included in the starter set which comes w/ little attatchable formula cups for powdered formula. You can measure how much you need and push it on to the bottom of the bottle. Great for on the go. Formula cant spoil and no need to heat up cold milk. Can cozies work perfect on these to help keep milk cold. My son is a bottle fed baby & has a problem latching on . He cannot get a good seal on the nipple and becomes gassy from swalling to much air. My advice would be to try these bottles but only open and use a few so if your child has the same problem you can return the unused bottles.
5,Best Bottle used for my Reflux-y Baby,"We tried several types of bottles for my colicky son who was diagnosed with reflux and torticollis and started refusing to nurse at around 3 months. We used the soothie pacifiers, so he immediately latched on to these bottles and we never had a single problem with them. His reflux started improving around the same time we switched to these bottles, probably more because of the medication he was on, but they certainly didn't make his sensitive tummy any worse. I also found a few of these that had convenient snap-on containers for the bottom that could store formula or snacks. So nice for planes!I have no complaints about these bottles, the shape made them easy for my baby to learn how to hold for himself and we are going to miss them when we make the switch exclusively to sippy cups in the near future! We love the soothie brand!"
4,compelling quality read,Beautifully written novel -- compelling and enjoyable and perfect for someone looking for a quality read that still has pace and fluidity
2,Did Not Find The Main Character Sympathic - Pity Party?,"I was not nearly as enamored with this book as most of the reviewers below. The biggest problem for me is that Alice simply was not a sympathetic character. She whines and excuses her bad behavior all the way through. She also covers up for and excuses the deplorable behavior of her near-do-well son. The only sympathetic character was the husband, who I sided with and felt extremely sorry for throughout the entire story. Her trips to the shrink are boring and add little to the story. I also thought that Alice was ridiculously over dramatic about the ""secret"" from her childhood she finally remembers, and overly dramatic about the death of her parents, as if she is the only person in the world who has ever suffered these experiences. Woe is me! Sounded like a pity party to me. All and all, not a winning story line, although the writing itself was really good. Perhaps I'll try one of her previous books and see if the story is better."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I have to admit that I judged this book by its cover as I am a doctor's daughter. The book started off very interestingly, with the main character, Alice, reaching midlife and looking for answers, both in her past and present. The past is blurred as her mother is dead and her father has dementia.From there the story does not know exactly what it wants to be, as it wonders off in many different directions. With the exception of Alice's best friend, I did not find the characters to be particurly likeable, so it was hard to get behind any of them. It did pick up toward the end, however the conclusion was evident long before I reached it.On the plus side, the writing was excellent. The author assumes the reader is intelligent and never condescends to them. This is a rarity in books today."
2,Static,"I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset."
1,I tried to read this with no success,I will very seldom give up on a book. This one wanders so I found it boring and going in 100 different directions. I never did finish the book.
2,Readers Beware!!!,"Be aware that most of Tarn's work cannot be supported by the evidence, as he was determined to weave together a narrative history. Historians, in reality, ""know"" very little about Bactria as the only remaining primary evidence from the period is the coin collection; aside from that, you have archaeology and secondary histories written after the fall of Bactria. Read the work of Frank Holt, arguably the best contemporary historian who researches this field. I have given this work two stars instead of one simply due to the ""classic"" nature of the book, but not because it should be the authority on Bactrian history."
1,Guppies: Fancy Strains...,"The photos were poorly saturated, old school photography, and he gives no description as to what defines each color group. There are so many new varieties since the book was published. It was a big disappointment."
1,Formula Fantasy with no surprises,"A bitter disapointment from a normally talented author. Waking in dreamland might as well have been a Zanth novel. After so many good books, if baffles me how this author could fall so low. Jody, you've been hanging around Anne McCaffrey too long."
2,"Good sound, but flawed","This recorder made excellent recordings that sounded good even at 44.1 kHz and 16-bit. Three major problems: biggest is short battery life-just over 2 hrs, and I was very careful (and once it's dead you're done until you can recharge). The Sony HD minidisk recorder gets 6 hrs with a battery add on. Next are the separate monophonic mini microphone inputs that are not compatible with any quality mikes I know of, and third, adjusting recording levels is overly complex with no quick way to adjust both channels, not a good thing for live recording.A good try that needs a few key design tweaks"
2,Do they even test these things?,"Another guy titled his review ""good sound, but flawed"", and that's about spot-on. Inputs are 1/8"" UNBALANCED PHONO. Who uses that? I had to get a chain of adapters to interface this with my equipment. Adjusting levels is a pain... Battery life is terrible. Charging is weird. Sometimes it won't charge despite being plugged in all day. I think it only charges when it's plugged in and turned on- and it turns itself off from inactivity. It also gets quite hot during operation, which makes me think it won't last all that long.So close Korg, yet so far."
3,Not Hurrying to Read Another,"The book was okay to me. Eleisha is cold, not human (ha), I found her character difficult to care about. The pace of the book is rushed, resulting in an exhausting feeling. I'm not in a hurry to read anything else by this author."
2,Hendee is better than this,"Being a fan of the Noble Dead series, I was looking forward to reading something different by Barb Hendee. I think she cut her teeth on this novel, because the writing just didn't even compare. The characters were pretty flat - I found myself not caring much about any of them, save an elderly vampire with dementia, and I really didn't care about the humans, either. Eleisha, our ""heroine"" vascillates between acting human but not really being able to feel human, but feeling sorry for humans...see where this is going? She's an anemic character in an anemic plot, offset by stronger, more evil vampires that seem out of place sharing a novel with her. So all in all, I was sorry I read it. I will, however, continue on with the Noble Dead series, which is fantastic in comparison."
3,"Good effort, although it's nothing to Anne Rice.","recently, i found this book while browsing through a local bookstore, the title was what cought my eye. Blood Memories was a fairly easy book to read. the writting of it wasn't wonderful, but i couldn't put it down :) you'll be surprized what happens to Eleisha in this book. I recommend this book to anyone whom loves to sit down for a day, relax on a big comfy couch and read. :)"
3,Good Story/Bad Editing,"This is the first in a series so a lot of time was spent outlining the rules for these vampires and introducing the reader to the cast of characters. I would have given the book more stars but the Kindle version was very poorly presented - sections of sentences were repeated causing me to go back several times to figure out what was going on. Editing was amateur - don't know if this was the case in the hard copy or not.I have a lot of Kindle freebies and understand that I am likely to get what I pay for, but I paid more for this Kindle version than I would have for the hard copy and am not happy with the quality.I have continued to read the series though and have completed 3 of 5 of the books that make up the series."
4,good,This book is good.. its keeps you reading.. and you don't want to put i down... ready to read the next book!
2,not sure if authentic,"i jumped at this wallet thinking that i would be getting the real thing at a fraction of the price. but it doesn't seem like it's authentic. the coach imprint inside on the leather looks crooked, the leather inside doesn't feel soft, and the box that it comes in is not the burgundy laminated box that i expected. the tag seems real but it's hard to tell.i am not sure if i got swindled..."
1,Caveat Emptor (Let the Buyer Beware),"I was VERY disappointed. All of the songs on this album are re-recordings - they are NOT ORIGINAL!! They are sung by Tommy Roe, but they are NOT the genuine, original recordings, and they just don't sound the same! I believe that Amazon should WARN people, in BOLD TYPE, if an album is made up of re-mixed or re-recorded songs or if songs are done by someone other than the original artists!! The only way to protect yourself is to read the description very carefully - to see if the songs are by the original artist, first of all - and then to listen to the music samples of the songs in the song list. IF the list of songs does NOT offer music samples (Windows Media Player, etc.) then BEWARE!! Somebody would rather not let you hear them before you buy! I'm going to be very careful in the future!I feel like I was ripped off. But, for six dollars, it's not worth the shipping to send the disc back. I'll use it as a Frisbee."
5,MacMaster at Her Best,"For any folk dancer such as myself the surest way to rate music of the type found on this recording is the strengh of the response ones feet make in listening to it. In the case of this, the latest release from Ms. MacMaster, the feet index went off the scale. Buy it and see for yourself."
3,Just So-So!,"I am a huge fan of Natalie MacMaster, but this is my least favorite of her CDs. The music is not bad--it's just sort of forgettable. There aren't any cuts that stand out such as some of the ones on Yours Truly or Blueprint. I would still recommend getting this CD if you are a fan, but I doubt that it will ever be your favorite."
4,Read it - you'll enjoy it.,"Melanie Milburne is very funny. I loved the hero's sense of humor and humanity. The herone was also extremely likeable. The ending was a bit soap-opera-ish, but the author tied up all her loose ends. Well-written and sweet."
4,It's a good ice breaker,"I was looking for answers to that exact question from my 4 year old and the book covers how a baby starts with a sperm and an egg. It started out great explaining how a bee carries pollen on it's legs from flower to flower creating a seed, but then the explaination becomes vague as it gets into the animals and humans and how the male sperm and the female egg get together to create a baby. The problem is that it answers the question where, but leaves the child with the question of How. It's honest and written to a 4 year old level with terminology that works well. I think it will help you break into a discussion of how that sperm gets to the egg."
4,Educational,Where Do Babies Come From? is a good book for children who are curious about babies and where they come from. This book includes real pictures of animals and people. Where Do Babies Come From gives general explanation of where baby animals come from and transitions over to people. Recommended to parents to read with their children 5+ years of age.
5,New Baby on the way,"This book is a fantastic way of letting older children (toddler, pre-k) know that Mommy has a baby inside her and how it got there. FANTASTIC!"
5,liszt piano concertos nos. 1 &2,"anything jean-yves thibaudet plays is superb. he is known as ""the poet of the piano"" which describes him beautifully. i have almost all of his recordings, watch him every day on youtube playing Saint-Saens No. 5 which he recorded recently, and the Grieg a minor with Dudamel which is also wonderful. without him and his music my life would be meaningless! all of his recordings i purchased at amazon."
4,Superb!!!!!!!!!!,"Cinderella has always been one of my favourite fairy tales, and I must say purchasing this book has given strength to my love towards the story! I know there are many versions of this story, but the one with the fairy godmother has always been the one closest to my heart. When I first saw the cover of this book I was already entranced with its beauty. Never have I seen Cinderella's ball-gown so detailed and lush with colour and magnificence! Being an artist myself, I give alot of attention to the visual part of a book. With all respect, I must say that whomsoever criticises the book's pictures in a negative way really needs to learn about the beauty of original art! K. Y. Craft has really done a splendid job with the story, and I hope to purchase more books in time with his art.My greatest wish is to sometime own a book of Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Little Mermaid' with Craft's original art!!"
5,Twice a Thousand Told Fairy Tales,"There are so many versions of Cinderella, but I love them all, and this one especially. Kinuko Craft is an amazing illustrator and quite possibly my favorite! Another wonderful bedtime story for kids, and if you are like me, for adults too!"
4,All time fav,"An all time favorite book on my shelf, the tale of Cindrella is an excellent narration of a girl who loves to dream and yet, slog with household work and ill treated by her step mom and sisters. This has been the first gift to me on my birthday alongwith Snow White years ago. The story sets a moral that those who take an advantage of others aren't admired. It shows how to be kind towards siblings. The physical ugliness of the step sisters attribute to their ugly behavior. There are hidden lessons to be taught to children - not to be rude, jealous or misbehave with their brothers and sisters. Cinderella is an example of the high morals to begin at home and form unity within the family. A good pick for children to enhance love for books and instil moral values.- ilaxi"
3,"pictures are better on screen, than on paper","I bought this book just for the illustrations. And they really are detailed and Classic (no abstract, no monsters). But the colors are surprisingly dark and ""dirty"" for children's books, they mostly are earthy, even muddy and, since the details are not crisp and fine anyway, it overall looks more like unfinished painting to me.The story itself is not the most common version of Cinderella, which actually adds interst to me."
2,New Music is Un-good,"I guess even great bands like Danger Danger are releasing horrible music. Well I guess it's not their fault, and if I wasn't so into 80's rock I probably would have liked it, but there's just something about the music nowadays that I don't like. It doesn't have a cheesy pop rock sound to it anymore. This album is nothing compared to their others. Even Poison is releasing music I don't like, Power to the People really stunk! I went to a Poison concert last year and when Poison played the Power to the People song, Poison almost got booed."
3,Climbing Kilimanjaro,"This books offers a good first hand account on preparing for a climb on Kilimanjaro. It puts on a personal touch that other books usually do not have. Although short, it is worth reading."
2,Not all that useful,"I like personal accounts of trips that I am planning and thought that this would fill the bill. However, the account of the actual climb is very brief and did not give me the info that I was looking for."
1,Not worth your time,"I've often thought about writing a book about a trip as a way to deduct the expense from my taxes, but I've refrained for fear that the result would end up like this book. Poorly written with very limited content, this book is of little interest and very limited use to anyone actually planning to climb Kilimanjaro. It's chief value is as personal account of the authors' climb, but you can find many similar accounts for free on personal websites everywhere."
5,Superb Brahms Recording,"Brahms - one of the greatest symphonists the world has ever known.Solti - one of the SUPERCONDUCTORS of the twentieth century.This recording - one of the legendary recordings of Brahms symphonies. The best I have ever heard. This recording won 2 Grammys in 1979. Best Classical Album and Best Orchestral Performance. It is deserving of the 2 Grammys indeed. And small wonder that Decca decided to reissue the album.Sir Georg Solti conducts with FIRE and POWER in these recordings. Decca's recording engineers have done a fabulous job in the recording. You couldn't tell the difference between this recording and Digital recording. FABULOUS performances. The incredible thing about this album is the price. At $28, this works out to a budget price of only $7 per CD. I VERY VERY STRONGLY recommend this set of CDs.Brahms was considered one of teh greatest symphonists (after Beethoven). If you are a classical music lover, this album is a MUST!!!!"
3,Not relevant,"This book is well-written, but it's thesis carries weight only if you believe there was a so-called ""bubble"" in the 90's.Sure, perhaps many investors lost money, but that does not a bubble make.The real problem in the 90's and into the current century is that the market has failed to realize that the Internet has changed everything, and that old methods of valuation no longer matter. The methods by which a company was valued in the past (earnings, cash flow, ROIC, ROA, ROE, etc.) no longer matter in this new world. Mind share, site visits, stickiness... This is what makes companies great in the new era.Lowenstein misses all of these. His old-fashioned way of thinking about companies is reminiscent of a dead era."
3,Covers the topic but flawed,"Lowenstein took a juicy and let's face it easy to write about topics greed and avarice, and tossed in a bunch of throw away simpleton comments that overall made me dislike him almost as much as the thieves he wrote about. Why authors can't stick to the topics at hand these days without interjecting blatantly over and over their political bias is beyond me. He also tries to adjust Adam Smith writings to support his own which comes off nonsensical to say the least. Quoting the noted liberal NYT economist, Paul ""I hate Bush"" Krugman says it all about Lowenstein bias. Overall, Lowenstein came off as a lightweight and this book is written for people with their minds made up already."
1,Horrible and Boring Book,"I bought this expecting to learn something new. It is a huge disappointment. There is virtually nothing in this book that anyone who opens a daily newspaper hasn't already read. It is basically a rehash of old newspaper articles; no investigation, no new thoughts, nothing. Plus, it was boring. I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading it."
1,Horrible Book,"This book is disgusting. Don't be fooled by the title. I was skeptical, but figured, for ~$15, why not take the chance there might actually be something useful in this book.This book is nothing but fluff and vagueness. Grandiose claims that go long on promises, but come up short on deliverables. 50% of the way into the text the author is still claiming that more details will be provided later on - by the time you get to the end of the book nothing useful has been provided, just a bunch of buzz-words and phrases to give the illusion that you actually learned something you could apply.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
1,Book is terrible,I read the book and agree with the other reviewer - the book is vague and I got the feeling it is really just a marketing tool to get readers to sign up and pay for their website. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK! The authors talk a good game in the book but lack the information to back it up - the title and info it says it provides is just not there.
2,same advice found on TV or word-of-mouth,the advice given is the same you would most likely get for FREE from a friend that has done any stock market investing.
2,Find a better book,"This book really is a waste of time. Like all the other reviewers say, it is vague and promises to explain things later then never does. I had a good laugh at the two page chapter on Dollar Cost Averaging that was supposed to be more complete than other books.I can't even find most of the methods they describe in their book available on charts on the internet. It's very frustrating when you're trying to learn and apply the knowledge, and where the hell is the Moving Average of Highs/Lows????? Bogus!"
5,Fantastic book!,"This was just a fantastic book. Not only did I find it informative, but the writing style was simply the best. The information is provided using a lot of humor making this a fun and easy read."
1,too bad,"I can't beleive what a disappointment this book is. I feel that the book has been padded with hype, babble, overly-obvious information, and covers little techniques with nothing in-depth. They insult the reader over and over, making it hard to want to keep reading. Too bad."
4,a bit disappointing,i was primarily disappointed by the black AND white illustrations... Otherwise a great read. It was most instructive and enjoyable :)
2,Relationship went Down all right,"This seemingly great book at the begining seemed to really put a southword trend on my relationship really fast. at lease this is how I felt in my mind. of course I stopped reading the book as soon as this started happening and realized no matter how helpful a book is 2 authors are not going to tell me that my relationship sucks when they havnt even met my partner nor I. they speak over and over again about how if the other person is not recipricating that your relationship is bad or that he doesnt love you. What about all those couples out there that have a purely Top Bottom relationship. Where one is the bottom always gives head jacks off in the bathroom? Just kidding. But really I know there are couples out there like myself that dont give and receive. Anyways its a good book to read if you and your partner swap duties, but too all the bottoms out there who are ONLY bottoms. Dont read this book. thats why i gave it 2 stars."
1,RUN TO KUMON!!!,"Parents: if your child is in an Investigations math classroomthen you should enroll your child in your local Kumon center!I am a second grade teacher who is being forced to use this series by my county. We are doing students a great disservice by using this curriculum. The parents do not understand the homework. Most teacher do not ""buy into"" the curriculum either. The teacher does not teach regrouping the traditional way. I can not think of much that is positive, other than some of the card games are fun for the children. Why must a child explain how they got the answer to 5 plus 3? They should be learning the standard algorithms and practicing for speed and accuracy... not drawing pictures or making tally marks to ""explain"" their answers."
3,misleading credits...,Those expecting to see Bruce Li as listed in the credits might be disappointed to find that it is actually Bruce Le in the movie. Still an excellent fight between Bruce Le and Hwang Jang Lee in one of the craziest flicks of all time.
1,Dangerous Utility Knife,I bought this knife because it was on the The Old House list of recommendations for gifts. People buying the knife should be aware that the blade does not retract. I think this is a serious safety issue.
4,Great writing pads,"These writing pads are excellent for theatre teachers because the stiff-back permits writing while walking and taking notes. They are very hard to find, and we're glad they are available here. Wish they came in a narrow-ruled version."
4,Great.,I needed this book fast before my class started. This book came in the time frame noted and I am satisfied with it
5,"On the whole, a good recording!","It may not be one of his greatest roles, but if you can manage to get the image of the Fat, Bearded, Italian Opera singer out of your head, Pavarotti sings a very believable Otello. Desdemona was one of Te Kanawa's signature roles, and this recording demonstrates why. She has a very vulnerable, pure, innocent, not to mention incredibly rich voice...absolutely perfect for this role. Leo Nucci portrays Iago for what he is: A corrupt and blackhearted man. Nucci has a very rich, creamy, dark-chocolate sound. I wasn't expecting to find Anthony Rolfe-Johnson in a Verdi recording...He usually doesn't venture past the 18th century...but he does a wonderful job, and that's all that matters. The chorus is lovely too...just listen to track 14 on disc 1 when they are showering Desdemona with flowers and affection...some of the loveliest operatic chorus music is in that scene. So don't hesitate to buy this recording."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"One would think that nothing can go wrong with this cast, but nevertheless the recording is disappointing in many ways. While Te Kanawa sings beautifully as expected and Pavarotti is truly impressive, Nucci's Iago is dreadful during the first act and improves only slightly in the course. This is a live recording, and the amount of coughing and nose blowing from audience (and, apparently, the cast !) is beyond what can be accepted. Some nice voices in the minor parts and Solti's courageous conducting cannot conceal the miscasting of a major role."
4,A Nice Set :),"This product came with a good variety of paints, clippers, a brush, PVA and model glue, and the sand and grass base coverings. The only reason I brought it down from 5 stars to 4 is that, when I received it, the top of the container of sand had come loose so a lot of my sand ended up all over the inside of the box. Besides that (which may have just been mishandling during shipping) this is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone painting 40K or Warhammer minis."
4,Great for struggling readers,"I am a high school English teacher and have been using this book as a resource for my students. Although I do not agree with all of the interpretations, I find it very useful. I recommend it to my students who are really struggling with the lovely language of Shakespeare."
2,What if I don't want to learn Cyrillic?,"The book starts off great and then about seven chapters into it, they start alternating between the Latin alphabet and the cyrillic so you've got every other chapter's examples, etc. entirely in Cyrillic. So, unless you spend time to learn that alphabet, those chapters are completely wasted. Buy it used, as cheap as you can as a supplemental text. That's about all it's good for."
1,Poorly Built Products,I have ordered 3 Mytee products and each is poorly made. Two of them have last less then 12 months. Buy name brand producys and avoid MYTEE!!
2,Works well only if your computers are not too far away,"It works barely okay for me the first 2 months. I linked it with 2 computers, one's upstairs, one's downstairs (only 80 ft apart). During those two months. 25% of the time, the computer that is not directly connected to my cable modem does not detect the network at all. after 2 months, it totally down. But when I used this phoneline kits to link 2 PCs side by side, it's working fine. I tried to contact 3com, they don't know why so far. I purcharsed phoneline kit for a reason."
5,Works like a charm,"Took it out of the packaging, put the HR strap on and it started working right away. I use it to track my HR during my workouts and it works great. I was familiar with the Timex menu organization, so I was able to get it setup quickly. It is easy to review the results after workouts - time in zone, avg HR, total calories, and avg HR for each split."
4,Been a Great Exercise Tool and a Good Watch,I did a bunch of research before I bought this. I love it. It really helps me to pace my workouts correctly to my plan. It is simple and easy to use. Not a lot of bells and whistles but enough for the price. Great beginner monitor for someone starting to get serious about training and exercising. I will probably go up in price and options the next time I purchase a heart monitor but that should be a while. This things seems to last. It also works as a good watch when you need it.
5,Not hurting,"I replaced my old 1995 HRM. I can say nothing against Timex. I just think it is loosing signal while in shade of body while I run. But on handlebars of my bikex worx. Price, design, functionality talx for recomendation of T5J031"
4,Good work out monitor,I bought this for my spinning classes. Now I know exactly how much to push and which zone to stay in.Reduced one star as the battery in the transmitter was dead when I bought it. Replaced it and works perfect.
4,completo y sencillo,Ideal.para entrenamientos sencillos y medio completos. Es muy intuitivo y fácil de configurar. No hay error de interferencias entre el reloj y el receptor de pecho... lo recomiendo
4,Does what's intended,"I picked this up to track heartrates and calorie burn doing cardio workouts. I read other reviews and everyone said this one was good. I agree what everyone else says is true. Good device, but a little difficult to use. Luckily I don't need all the functionality. IMO it does come with good documentation. What I like best is that it is comfortable to wear. The watch weighs nothing and the strap does not constrict. This is a mandatory tool for those who excercise a lot."
3,Difficult to read word functions on screen,The most observable complaint I have with this Timex Heart Monitor watch and the Ironman Heart Monitor line is the difficulty reading the functions inside the watch face. Days of the week (see Thursday) time function (see Chrono) look like they were handwritten inside the watch. The letters are uneven or not in a straight line which detracts from the credibility of this timepeace. Timex should focus on re-writing these functions clearly and choose a different font!
4,"works well, a little non-intutive","This heart rate monitor works much better than my last one (from Sports Instruments). The readings seem steady with none of the strange readings I was getting with my old monitor. Perhaps because it is digital I have not had any cases where interference messed up the readings. (My Sports Instruments heart monitor always gave me a heart rate of zero when I went by a local telecom building.)I had no problem setting it with the instructions, but in use I have had problems remembering how to toggle between the modes and how to get the information back out. The Sports Instruments had at least as many functions yet was much easier to use. I am sure that it can't be to difficult, and I will look up the steps again, but the functions should be organized better so I can figure it out without remembering the minutia.I guess I will live with the middling user interface for a reasonably-priced heat rate monitor that has worked flawlessly."
4,Workout Guide,"This is a reasonably priced and effective guide to maximize your workout. Lets you see at a glance whether you're in your aerobic zone. Compiles and summarizes the data from your workout--time spent in the zone, maximum heart rate, time to recover, calories burned, etc. Difficult to assess how accurate these measurements are. Consumers Report says the heart rate measurement is accurate. In any event, whether or not 100% accurate, the data provides a useful baseline to measure progress from one workout to another. Takes a bit to get used to the settings, but that just may be my own ineptitude."
3,Not for small wrists!,"After researching several watches, I decided on this one. I am a woman with very small wrists, and this watch is HUGE on my wrist at the smallest setting. The watch is listed as unisex and makes no mention of size. I am so disappointed."
3,Battery Hungry,"1. The product does everything that it claims to do.2. The watch looks nice enough to wear all the time as your main watch.3. The strap that needs to be used to send your heart beats is comfortable.4. You can learn the HRM quickly if you fool around with it a little bit. If you are a computer nerd, you will learn it in less that one hour.5. The only thing negative is that it uses batteries like crazy. I have to use a new battery every week and that costs $5. There is no shut off botton on the transmitter so it is constantly on and the battery drains."
5,great product and functionality,"This is an elementary and reliable heart rate monitor. It is easy to use and durable. I have used it since February and now routinely wear it for all exercise. The watch has a stop watch, lap timer, alarm, hrm, calorie counter, max/min/ and average heart rate counter and tracks where you are in desired heart rate zone. This is a terrific product --works well and does just what it is supposed to do. I'd recommend buying a spare battery for the chest transmitter; it wore out after about 50 hours of exercise use."
2,Not Easy to use,"This is the 3rd heart rate watch I've bought, I had a Polar and a Nike, the Polar was great, very, very easy to use, the Nike was rubbish, and this one was supposed to be the best---but its very difficult to use (I mean anything besides the heart rate part)---recording workouts, the interface, and calories burned--are not clear. I still have not found out how to see Calories burned, and there is no indication of how to see calories burned in the instruction manual--even though it says that it calculates calories burned on the box and in the description.As a heart rate monitor--it is very accurate, but for everything else it suffers with a poor, confusing interface--I don't even bother wearing it!"
1,Misleading description,"Misleading description of product, not good sales & marketing approach! Will post negative facts on lineProduct sucks sucks sucks"
3,Heart rate monitor: Timex,"I bought this product at discounted price. Except for the calorie counter,the monitor works fine. I want to know if the discounted price was given becaue of the defect. Anybody has any answer?"
3,"Great HRM, lousy transmitter","Previous HRM was the same model, but transmitter went bad. Occasionally registered 240 bpm after ~8 months, then frequency increased until it was reading 240 bpm almost all the time by 1.7 years after purchase. Chenged transmitter battery, did not help. Borrowed someone else's identical HRM and confirmed that their HRM with my transmitter still registered incorrect reading ( always 240 bpm). Found price for a new transmitter is nearly as high as new HRM (with transmitter), so purchased the new HRM. New transmitter works fine so far with either old HRM or the new one. If not for the transmitter problem, I would give the HRM 5 stars."
4,It works as told,"This product works as mentioned in reviews. A simple but efficient HRM for the entry class trainers. I have just started using it and if any fault develops, i will post another review."
3,Solid product,"While there are products out there that do way more than this watch, the also cost quite a bit more. This is the second watch that I've had, having lost the one I had before. Replaced the strap on my original purchase twice and (as another reviewer faulted) the battery several times! However, the core functionality of the watch held up even when using it while swimming.What it does it does well and reliably and that is more than one can say about many products out there."
4,Great Product,"Great product, has a easy to understand manuel, and this watch shipped very fast.I am very pleased with this product!!!!!"
4,Timex HR Monitor,"After looking at HR monitors for some time, I saw this model reviewed in Consumer Reports. Since it had a very favorable review, I decided to purchase it from Amazon. I received the item in very good time and so far it has lived up to expectations. I do a lot of hiking at a local State Park and like being able to keep track of not only my heart rate but also max and average heart rates. The stopwatch feature is also very useful. Since I have only had for this watch for a little under 2 months, I can't report on battery life of the watch or chest strap, but overall I'm very pleased with the quality of this item considering the price and would definately buy again."
4,Good for HRM!,"Seems to be accurate for HRM. Couple books to read, I have not done this yet. Has zones and actual HRM. Seems very durable and is comfortable to wear. Priced right!"
5,Hubby Happy,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. It's not too fancy for a workout watch and not cheaply made either. It is easy to figure out - though there are tons of manuals included in case you get lost.
5,Great Heartrate Monitor,This is a great Heart Rate Monitor. Has all of the necessary features and is easy to use. I would definitely recommend it!
1,"Disappointed, repeat failure","This is the second Timex Heart Rate monitor watch that I purchased in a 3-month period. The screen of the first watch froze. This watch stopped communicating with the transmitter. I have friends with Timex monitors that work fine, but I have had bad luck, and plan to switch to a different brand.On the plus side, the watch was easy to set up and the directions are clearly written."
3,Good for the price point,I bought this to help take my fitness to the next level and it helps but I've had a hard time learning to use it. For the price it works great. Some of the HRM watches are very expensive and this one has been a good first purchase.
5,very handy watch,"alright i ordered the watch from amazon and i was very happy with the shipping and packaging and handling. 5 stars there. the watch came with three manuals, the watch and the chest transmitter and strap. very very easy to set and get started; after only 15 minutes i had the watch ready and set with all of my heart info including my max heart rate and zone intensity (they show in the manual how to find the heart info out). 4 stars there. right after the 15 minutes i geared up and went on a 20 minute bike ride to try it out; i can already get a basis of what my heart rate is during an exercise without a h.r.m. so i can account for the good accuracy of this device; it also shows at the end of your workout the average h.r., the peak h.r., minimum h.r., calorie burnage and lastly your heart recovery rate. 5 stars. the only downside is if you have a small wrist do not buy it because it is made for larger wristed people. 3 stars there"
1,"Mistake, Mistake",As a watch this Timex T5J031 is great - but trying to use for heart rate monitor - horriable. The chest belt stopped collecting data in less than a month - not sure if it's battery or what - but hate this watch. Had to order another without chest belt. I read the reviews but did not listen to the low rated reviewers (should have).
3,Don't count on the calories,"Overall quality of the watch is good. Ease of use is good after a few try's. My biggest gripe with this watch is the calorie counter. It is very inaccurate and overstates the count by a lot. I have been using a Sigma monitor and it was far more accurate than this was. There is no setting for gender, just your weight so it does.not know if you are a 170 pound male or female which can varie your calorie count greatly. So if you are counting calories this watch will give you a false sense of a huge calorie burn when you can subtract about 35% off that total for a real number."
3,Good basic HRM,"This is a good HRM for the money. The manual is not very good and the Timex website is even worse. No matter what I do, it seems to want to start new laps. So at the end of an even, I have 5 or so laps even if I have not touched any buttons. The description says it is data recorder compatible but there is no mention of this in the manual so I don't know what that means. The best thing about this watch is that once it gets a heart rate, it stays locked on and is up to the second accurate."
4,Heart Monitor Works Fine,"For the price, this item works well. The watch has a somewhat cheap look and feel, but it appears somewhat rugged."
2,"Warning,,, Does not display HR on Gym Cardio Machines","This is my third HRM over the last 10 years, the previous two were both Polar models. When I bought this HRM I made the WROMG assumption that my Gym's cardio equipment would pick up the HR signal from the chest strap and display it on the machines' display, nope. I like this feature as it is much easier to track HR on the cardio machine display rather than glancing down at my watch. Obviously the signal protocol is not industry standard, sucks! The two brands of cardio machines that I tried this on were LifeFitness and Cybex and apparently they only seem to pick up HR signals from Polar HRM straps. So I am in the process of returning this HRM.I was surprised that I did not see any feedback about this in the reviews for this product. I actually like this HRM but it does not meet all my requirements."
1,broke down after a month,"After a month of usage, the watch or the chest strip could not pick up the heart beat anymore. I obviously changed the battery to no avail. It conveniently broke 2 days after the return-your-item deadline. Now I'll throw it away and I'll buy a more expensive one. Do not buy this product"
4,nice hrm system,"just switched from the single piece pulse monitor to this system and so far so good. i thought that the chest strap would be uncomfortable but onrce i get going, i dont notice. the chest sensor sends a rf signal to the watch which gives a constant heart readout for as long as it receives a signal from the transmiter."
4,Does the job,"First watch didn't work but Amazon was great and sent an immediate replacement. Second watch and chest band work just fine. I'd give this a five star except that this heart rate monitor will not show up on the computer on my Lamond bike (my Polar monitor and Omitron monitor both do). But - it does track my calories in the watch, so that is really useful when I'm on the rowing machine or on the weight machines. Chest band is comfy and when the watch band is fastened at the very last hole, it curves around my wrist nicely. I would recommend it and recommend you buy it from Amazon just in case you have a problem with it."
1,Worked for awhile,"At first I loved the performance, but now I can't even get a heart beat after changing batteries etc. I have only had this device for 2.5 months."
1,Just doesn't work anymore,"This watch was FANTASTIC for about 9 months. Then it simply stopped registering a heartbeat anymore (after going insane for a few days telling me my heart rate was 190+ while standing still). Really enjoyed the layout, fit, different modes and the strap was comfortable. Replaced all batteries and reset the transmitter but to no avail."
4,Makes Working Out Fun,"I can tell that since I purchased this heart rate monitor watch my workouts have been more strenuous because I anxiously await the end of them to see how many calories I burned and how long I was in the zone. Speaking of zones, I am not sure why, but if I work out in Zone 2 one day then Zone 5 the next, I get two completely different calorie burn readings. My heart rate chart says that I should max out at 175, but that's high for someone like me to reach who has a resting heart rate of 53-59, so I keep it in Zone 2, which is for calorie/fat burn. I think the calories burned that it shows for that zone are realistic.The only other thing is that the watch is small, so it's kind of hard sometimes to click one side of the watch to set something without pushing the opposing button at the same time. You have to rest your thumb on the side of the watch to push the button on the side, but when you do so you press another button. I have learned how to gingerly push the buttons."
2,Not an accurate calorie counter,"I purchased this watch/HRM to actively monitor my heart rate while working out, and to get a calorie burn estimate. Since I typically ride a bike or play racket sports, rather than use gym equipment, an external HRM was a must. While the heart monitor works great, and allows me to track my heart rate, and work within specific target zones, the calorie calculation is way off. The only variable you are able to account for is weight. There's no way to change height, sex, VO2Max, or age. Without these features you cannot get an accurate calorie burn estimate, and I believe, the formula Timex uses accounts for far too many calories being burned. I typically use an online calculator(s) with my heart rate average to get an accurate reading of my calorie expenditure. Unfortunately, that is the main reason I bought this combo, and it doesn't do that, therefore I cannot recommend this HRM/watch combo."
4,Excellent HRM,"I've had this Heart Rate Monitor for nearly a year and it's been a steadfast performer. The watch element is straightforward to operate and the readout, while small, is easy on the eyes. The chest strap is well made and comfortable. I've use it about once per week and as yet have not had to replace any battery. If you're looking for a simple HRM with settable training zones this would be a good choice."
4,Works well,This Heart rate monitor does what its supposed to. The setup and understanding of all the different functions takes time. I am happy with this purchase.
2,Look elsewhere,This is not a product I would recommend. First off the watch is advertised as Water Resistant to 50 meters.....The packaging states only 30.The Heart rate strap is erratic and the readings are all over the place. I've tried water and gel but no change.The Heart rate strap ONLY works with the watch. I've tried it with Precor and Life Fitness machines at the gym. Nothing.The Calorie burn is not even worth putting on this watch. 521 Calories on a 30 minute walk? Yeah right. 1015 Calories burned on a 45 eliptical session? Not a chance.In fact this product does not do anything right other than tell the time and stop watch. And you don't need this watch for that. This one goes right back to Amazon.
2,Water in the Watch,"This watch has leaked water into the wrist watch after 10 months of use. I don't dive, but swim laps in a pool. If the watch did not leak water, I would give it a 4 out of 5 for over all performance. Be cautioned, if you buy this watch it may leak water into the display."
1,Terrible Product with Lousy Instructions,I purchased the Timex fitness watch based on positive reviews. It looked like just what I wanted to upgrade from a lesser value fitness watch. When it arrived I programed it and made sure the battery was in the chest strap and then tried to make it work. I was quite surprised when I could not get a heart beat icon on the watch. I pushed the right button and adjusted the strap---still nothing.I then started reading the instruction booklets and they did not help in any way. The booklets seem to be focused on fitness theory and workout max and min. There was no clear instructions on how to get the watch to work. No troubleshooting.I'm very familiar with fitness watches as I have used them for more than 10 years. I would rate this watch as a do not buy. I sent it back to Amazon for a refund.
1,This product did not work for me.,"I was so excited to order this watch, however it did not work at all for me! I could not even get the heart rate monitor to work for over a few seconds. And, yes, I did wet the parts on the strap that help it work. I even went out and bought a new battery right away and it still did not work.However, I did send it back, got my money back and ordered a Polar watch and I LOVE it and it worked right away!"
3,Mixed feelings,"I chose this HRM based on reviews and price range. The watch functioned beautifully and I liked the big, easy-to-read display. The HRM transmitter, which you wear around your chest, was comfortable and not incumbering. However, the HRM feature worked intermittently. I was only able to get it to work once for an entire workout. At other times it would start off fine but would loose the signal about 5 minutes into the exercise and I could not get it to restart. I tried a new battery, different wetting methods for the transmitter, etc. and nothing seem to correct the problem. I am returning this HRM and looking for a replacement."
2,Disappointed,"I have always liked Timex products. The Ironman brand is well respected and easy to use. The heart rate monitor technology used in these watches has much to be desired, however. I have never gotten a consistent heart rate on this watch. I have gone through 3 different chest straps, which Timex replaced no questions asked, and countless batteries. I have used ultrasound gel on the chest strap as well for better conduction... still no consistent HR. I love the functionality of the watch but the HR is frustrating. I went with this brand originally because you can replace the battery yourself. Polar has since come out with a few models with that feature. I finally switched over to a Polar and no problems whatsoever. Sorry Timex, I love the watch but the HRM stinks."
5,Great monitor - especially for a newbie,"I purchased this heart monitor after borrowing a similar, but more expensive Reebok monitor from a family member. I found that this monitor was extremely easy to use and picks up my heart very quickly (better than the borrowed one I tried). The watch is nice and is easy to read even while jogging, biking, etc. This is my first heart rate monitor and I haven't learned how to use all the features yet, but if you are looking to simply monitor your heart rate and track it while you work out, I think this is a great option."
2,"Strap too short, BPM way wrong","I just got my new Timex, I was excited due to the highly positive reviews in this page.My first problem was with the chest strap: it is too small for me even at the maximum position. I have a large chest size (I am a male, 5'9, 192 Lb, my chest is large I admit), so it is very uncomfortable, I can barely breath. I have a Polar strap and monitor and that strap fits me fine without even extending the setting to the maximum.The second problem I found is the heart rate showing 30 BPM!!! I must be dead I guess... in fact my resting hear rate as measured in other ways is exactly double that value (60). The 30 figure is way wrong of course.In short, I'll be packing this toy back to Amazon after no more than a couple of hours in my possession."
