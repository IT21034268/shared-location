2,Weak!,"This is more like the manual that should have shipped with InterDev (what each menu does, etc) than anything that can be construed as useful. I actually held out for this book over the Wrox ASP book. Big mistake. If they come out with a new edition for VInterDev 2.0, they should include some EXAMPLES!!!!!"
2,Ideal for the Web developer new to the Microsoft tool set...,"After reading ""Professional Active Server Pages"" and ""Active Visual Basic 5.0"", I felt like I was wasting my time with ""Inside Microsoft Visual InterDev"". The book is appropriate as an overview for an entry level Web developer that has had no experience with Microsoft development tools. At the very least, I would hope to see significant examples in future editions."
5,I LOVE MAIDDA HEATTER!,This is a must have for anyone who loves baking. Maida Heatter does not disappoint. I just made her chocolate chip cookie recipe out of her cookie cookbook and everyone loved them!!!Also this book arrived very quickly and in great condition. Thank you!
5,Wonderful book,"I'm surprised there are any poor reviews of this book. I've tried between 6 - 8 recipes so far. They are excellent, get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I've had no issues with baking times or other instructions. Love this book! This is my first Maida book and I will buy more."
3,No photos!,"I was disappointed that there were no photographs inside this book, as I find photos helpful not only for choosing what I want to bake, but also helpful in creating a finished cake."
5,Great!,"The watch is nice. It has a cool face design and the size of the watch is cool too. All around its a great watch, especially for the price."
4,Women'd Softspots Venus Lite Work Loafers Bone 9 5 N,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
3,Softspots - Women's,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
1,Magical shrinking leggings,"These leggings were great out of the package. They fit perfectly and were very soft. However, after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost. I wouldn't buy them again."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"I bought these because of the reviews. I usually buy the $5 leggings at forever21 and wanted to invest in a nicer pair but cant afford lululemons.. So I thought maybe it would be a similar but knockoff type brand. OMG these leggings are the EXACT same quality as forever21's except the only difference is that these are $30 vs $5... I am returning them, reason being, is that they are see through and not worth the money. I also bought ""capezio"" leggings which I added the link below, and they are a little bit cheaper but more importantly NOT see through.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZMCQK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00"
2,great but disappointed,"5'5"" 140 lbs. I ordered these in large. They are great; made in USA, nice fabric; great price. So I ordered three more pair but sized up to XL so I could freely launder without them becoming too small. The XL are same as L... so I guess anyone larger than 140 should look elsewhere. They actually told me they add 1/8th inch to the XL. Now that is just ridiculous !!! I do notice that washing them makes the legs longer. Too bad because they are terrific tights."
3,"Yup, Not for petites","I like the thickness of the material and they seem well made, but they're a bit long. I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs, but thick in the middle so I bought Medium. I can fold up a good 2"" or more at the cuff and the legs themselves seem a bit floppy. I may try the Small next time, but I still suspect they may be a bit long. Shame, nice product and very good price."
3,Not as much spandex as expected,"These leggings are nice but I expected a silkier shinier legging. They were worth the discounted price. not as thick as a legging, more of a tight."
3,good,"these leggings are good but not great. they are the right length and size, but they could have been a little thicker"
3,Too high shipping,"Walmart quality, but be aware that you have to pay tax and shipping, to California, the shipping is $7.25, so overrall cost for this legging is:$17.92"
5,Great Leggings,"This product is great. For the price, the product is top quality. Thick, comfortable, and they are long enough to easily cover my ankles (which many leggings don't. Thanks for a great buy!"
2,Not for a petite woman,"I'm 5'3"" 112 lbs. The small size is sluggish and 1 1/2 inches longer than I would like them to be. It's well made and material is ok for the price-not too thick nor thin. I'm afraid that they don't have x-small size."
2,Super thin,"I didn't care for these leggings. They are very thin and not at all substantial. I should have returned them, but kept them for warmer weather wear."
4,Great fit!,"Ordered these white leggings in Large. Received promptly. Nice fabric. Fit is close but not snug, with easy stretch and no ""baggy knees"". Would purchase again."
3,very nice!,I like these leggings but I can't say they're as nice as I hoped. They're thin and I personally like them a little heavier weight. I feel they fit a bit better on the heavier side. I do find that they slide down and I'm forever pulling them up.
3,Wasn't exactialy what I was looking for.,"I was disappointed with this product, because the fabric wasn't what I had been looking for. I had to return this product even though the traansaction went perfectly."
5,Perfect for me,"The last reviewer is right. I searched and searched for leggings that were long enough for my 5'10"" frame. These are perfect. The legs are plenty long enough. I am very happy with these."
4,My New Pants,"Though these pants aren't the warmest for cold weather by themselves, they are great for layering and hopefully summer wear. The material is not too thick and not too thin, and it fits comfortably - not tight at all. The waistband is very snug, and the shipping was very fast... most likely the reason for the high shipping and handling costs."
1,Shrunk and See Through,"These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality,they are see through.I doubt these will last.There are better choices."
2,See through,"So I found a great deal on these and purchased two pairs...however, I will only be wearing these with a long shirt or dress. I don't know how many ladies who bought these have turned around, bent over,and taken a good look in the mirror. I have and got a great look at my ass! I suggest not buying these if you plan on wearing them to yoga and doing some forward folds!"
2,Ripped first wearing,"I didn't try these on after purchasing for a couple months, and during the first wearing, the center seam busted and that was it. Needle holes had expanded and split along one side. Not a good quality fabric."
4,nice tights,"solid color, a little show through on the butt area however they are thick enough to not be mistaken for stockings."
2,spandex leggings,I didn't find that these legging gave support. They were thin and I really couldn't feel the spandex. They just were not what I wanted.
2,Not Athletica - decent quality,"The label on the back says ""City Lights"" [...]Not really sure if it's Athletica unless they don't put that label on them. The pants are nice. But not what I was expecting. I've used them for yoga and biking. They are comfortable and durable."
3,returns,I received an item today that I was not satisfied with and I called the seller and spoke to Mark. He was very helpful with my return process and apologized for the delay in receiving my item.
3,Peggy Says,The product was not Spandex. They were 90% cotton and 10% Lycra They are OK but not nearly as nice as my older pair which are 90% nylonpolyamide and 10% Spandex
3,a screamer,"the things i like about this blade are: it has good sized teeth , good for many sharpenings : it does make a good cut : the thing i hate is when it is in a table saw and running between cuts it has a very iritating high pitched scream. definitely not recommended for table saw."
2,Doesn't really work,I got this hoping to make eggs about the size of my english muffin. Won't really hold an egg in. It leaks out all around the edges. I have tried to start witha super hot skillet but that doesn't help either. I woulding purchase it again.
4,"Great idea, doesn't always work.","This is a great idea, but the ring doean't always stay flat on the cooking surface. So, the egg oozes out from underneath."
3,okay,This must be on a flat surface or eggs/mix will run away. Size was larger than the picture and pancake mix kind of got stuck on the edges.
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this thinking it would help me make egg and bacon sandwiches, you know, with a nice round piece of egg. It did not. I have tried it many different ways and it always ends up stuck to the ring and making a mess. I also tried it with pancakes the other day to see if it worked any better with them, it didn't. I like the idea of the product but the actuality of it is not good."
1,i got something totally different,"I just have to say i got something definitely look different from the picture above.what I have got is only the handle part of the egg ring, which is as big as my thumb, without the circular silicone part.not sure should i be claiming for return or exchange or not, it is just too much of a hassle for a 5 dollar piece of silicone."
5,Works just as I had hoped,"This item keeps an egg in a nice, round shape while it fries, thereby avoiding the usual expansion of a raw egg across the surface of the pan. The fact that this ring is made of Silicone instead of metal makes it suitable for use in non-stick frying pans. Since it is billed as a combo pancake mold/egg-frying mold, it is slightly larger in diameter than would be ideal for a sandwich-sized egg, but it does work well and doesn't burn your fingers. I am not disappointed."
4,Almost word for word,I bought this book strictly based on the reviews from amazon. The book is all questions and most of the test is word for word. You may want to buy a supplement book such as exam cram. That is pretty much all you need.
4,Worth the money,"This was the first Readiness Review book that I used for a Microsoft test and it was very good. It made an excellent supplement to the Sybex study guide. The questions tend to be a little on the easy side when compared to the actual test, so you should make sure you can answer every question before taking the actual exam. Some of the questions in the Review were nearly word for word on the test. This book helped me get a 933 on this test."
5,Buy this one and pass it!,"I bought a copy of this book based on the reviews here, and I must say everyone was right! This should be considered a ""must have"" if you're taking the TCP/IP exam. The book asks some pretty tough questions (the real exam questions are a bit tougher) and will give you an excellent flavor on EXACTLY what to expect from the exam. The book asks you a question, then explains both the right AND WRONG answers to the question. I also read the TCP/IP guide from Prentice Hall and found the two of these books to be very complimentary. I scored a 966 on the exam."
4,Best bang for the buck!,"An interactive cd that lets you take unlimited random exams and then compare the answers / questions with the explainations in the book. Yes, the book actually explains the answers and how they derived them. Very helpful, but I wonder why they didn't put the same on the cd? The tests are by Self Test Software which is a far cry from Transcenders. However, the price difference is HUGE. $30 vs about $150, go figure. You will still need the book ""Internetworking with TCP/IP on Windows NT 4.0"" ISBN 1-57231-623-3 for a training guide unless you are VERY familiar with TCP/IP. This MCSE readiness review for TCP/IP tests your knowledge while still letting you learn -- not bad!"
3,A Different Spin...,"Just to buck the trend...I agree totally with the comments regarding balance and content - but I just didn't think the questions presented here were hard/comprehensive enough! - relative to those I received on the actual exams! I initially used this book to finish off after a MOC course on TCP/IP and failed the exam - just. I used additional material to flesh out the concepts, and passed easily today. (On a more positive note - I did find it's sister publication on Networking Essentials an excellent/comprehensive prep tool)."
3,Burt in top form,"Burt Reynolds gets beat up so much in this film, it's a wonder he can make love to Dyan Cannon on top of a pool table mid-movie! A convoluted action-genre exercise designed to show off it's star, and Reynolds is very low-key, self-depreciating, and sexy in his Cosmo-pin-up era. Dyan Cannon looks even better, though she's given little to do as a woman involved second-hand in a murder. Pretty good for a one-time viewing, but I wouldn't buy it."
4,Shamus,"One of Burt Reynolds Action classics from the 70'sBurt is a private eye, who gets it really hot....something he did'nt suspect...i'll gladly recomend this movie...."
4,Colorful Characters,"This movie was made at the start of Burt Reynold's stardom. He plays a down-on-his-luck P.I. (granted, not a very original concept), but Burt was born for this role as the wise-cracking, street smart detective. A character actor named Ron Weyand who plays E.J. Hume, Burt's client in the plot, steals every scene he is in - this guy is amazing and I wonder why his screen work is so limited? Anyway, this is a fast-paced drama with plenty of interesting characters and some good laughs too."
2,Misleading,"This ""soundtrack"" should have been titled ""Music inspired by We were Soldiers"" or something to that tune. If you want the actual score/ soundtrack of this film, you should look for the similarly titled album but COMPOSED by Nick Glennie-Smith. That CD is truly 5 star material.This album is not too bad in itself, if you are into 60ish songs but the misleading name is highly irritating and misleading hence I deduct one star from my true rating."
1,MMMMMMMMMM song?,"I haven't heard this CD, but is that song on it when they are getting on the helicopters for the first time in combat? You know, the one that goes ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"". What is the name of that song?"
2,What the hell,Where's the real soundtrack? I want those haunting symphonic strings and other songs heard in the movie!
2,Inspirational it is NOT.,"There were only two pieces that I recall from the movie and they are the last two on the CD. The rest is junk, wasn't part of the movie and not at all inspiring."
1,Where's the movie music?,"I was very disappointed with this soundtrack. The music from the film is notably absent. A soundtrack is supposed to feature music from the film, isn't it? This CD simply fails to remind of the film in any way. Overall, a good CD, but it has little to do with the movie. The only track on this CD which reminds me of any portion of the movie is the Gallic piece they play during dustoff."
2,They tricked me!!!!!!!,"Well, kind of anyways. I bought this cd right after the movie, not thinking to scout out the cd when I purchased it. I had assumed that this cd would feature the score and IT DIDN'T! Oh well, my stupidity is to blame for that I suppose.Among the songs on this cd are a few solid songs like Tammy Cochran's 'I Believe' and a new version of Steven Curtis Chapman's 'Solidier'. Buyer beware, though, this cd only has one song from the movie. If you want my honest assessment, buy the REAL movie score, not this cd."
4,Really good...,"I bought this CD because the movie was so good. The music was very diversified; some country, some alternative. But tracks two and eleven are fabulous and really capture the heart of what was going on at that time. After seeing the movie, this soundtrack really brings it all back for you, like you were watching it all over again."
3,"""Didn't I"" is the Backbone to this Disc","This album is a hit and miss of contributors. It has it's ups and downs. Montgomery Gentry's performance stands out to be the best of the disc, and obviously the label agrees, ""Didn't I' was the first commercial single release from the disc. Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry harmonize so well, that it amazes me that they have only been around for a couple of years. Rascal Flatts has a very cool gospel type of song on there. India.Arie's ""Good Man"" as good as well, and you can never go wrong with Steven Curtis Chapman. The album could have been better. But it does have some strong points, just not many."
5,Wonderful!!,"For those who love Secret of the Ruby Ring, love, (relatively realistic) time travel and Yvonne MacGrory, this a the perfect book for you!Martha and the Ruby Ring is the story of Martha, the grandmother of Lucy, and her story of her dealings with the ruby ring. Martha made her wish on the ring to go to a fancy ball, so be careful what you wish for... But Martha had a much better life when she made the journey back to early Ireland, being presented as a visiting cousin of a well to do family. There she falls in love with a young man named Andrew, and has quite an adventure trying to recover the ring that she lost and get home to present day, as well as enjoying a gand ball. The end is a charming surprise, and very touching. I hope you enjoy this book as much as the first one, and also a well written work of Yvonne MacGrory. Enjoy!!"
2,Still didn't have every fitting I need!,"Where there are a number of fittings here, I still didn't have everything I needed to use a generic r12 manifold set on my factory installed R12 vehicle!"
1,revisionist dissembling,"Only a ""scholar"" could ignore the plain text of Leviticus 18:22, Romans 1:26-32, and similar pre-Christian and early Christian proscriptions of homosexual sex, then divert into the etymology of the term ""sodomy"" to pretend that the sinfulness of homosexual behavior is some recent fabrication of a ""homophobic"" cabal in the Church. As early as the Council of Ancyra (314 A.D.) the Church spoke juridically against those ""who.. commit [acts of] defilement with animals or males."" Certainly that the Church spoke in different terms, even in circumlocutions, to avoid describing acts so foul against Christian morality provides no ""cover"" for the sin. Whether ""sodomy,"" ""defilement,"" or ""liers with mankind,"" Christians have always taught that homosexual behavior is intrinsically disordered and sinful --- at least until revisionist ""scholars"" sought to muddy the water with fabrications."
3,This must be the only Chieftains I just like,Don't get me wrong I love this group but I just didn't feel it this time. 6. If I Had Maggie in the Wood is probably the standout for this collection. This is a great album if you need Irish background music but the group was always at its best when the songs told a story and there is none of that here.
3,Good Foundation-But needs to be supplemented,"I agree with the comments of the other reviewers however, I need something with more ideas. It seems very limiting and I have no variety with my diet. It also doesn't address certain areas. For one, salad dressings. It says you can use salad dressing but then it does not tell you what kinds, what it should or should not contain, whether certain dressings are better when you are eating carbohydrates or when you are eating protein. It just leaves some tables unturned. But it offers the fundamentals...a good place to start. Any suggestions for other sources?"
4,Food Combining by Jackie Habgood,"Jackie Habgood's book The Hay Diet Made Easy is just that--an easy to read and understand book on the theory and practice of William H. Hay's food combining diet. While there are other books available, this is perhaps the best for someone new to method, as well as those who suffer from various ailments to which our esteemed medical establishment often turns a blind eye. The only drawback to Ms. Habgood's work is the actual layout of the sections: these tend to run together without a definite sense of division. However, whether for reference (her charts are great) or inspiration or learning, this book is truly the only book one would need to purchase."
4,new start,This book makes the hay Diet easy to understand and it really does help. I have had major allergy problems for years and when I stick to this diet and take some vitamins from my naturopath I feel fine. It gives recipes and examples of menu planning. Try it to improve your health!
3,Better Than the Food Combining Bible,"The fact that this book was written in the UK, makes some of its language a bit foreign, however, it is still an informative book. Very direct presentation. No recipes, not much in the way of menus, but compared to The Food Combining Bible, it is, in my opinion, much easier to understand."
3,Searching for great health,"The Hay Diet Made Easy is in english.... but not american. I think there are a few things that get's ""lost in translation."" The british slang was hard to follow. The writting style in this book does not ""flow"", I found it ""choppy"". But other than that.... It was informational."
5,Love it!!,"I personally found nothing wrong with 11 live, except that it needed more features! 10:30 and artflick were very cool to watch more than once, and the concert itself just rocked!! I have to stop raving on, so I'll just tell you to buy this DVD!!"
2,What A Disappointment,"I ahve purchased and rented many concert videos and DVDs over the years, and found the production values to be amateurish, at best.The photography on the concert itself was dark and drab, nowhere near the quality of Jars of Clay's music videos. This was a modern recording, so why is it only in 224kbps 2.0 stereo? What about a PCM or Dolby Digital 5.1 mix? The 2.0 stereo sounded almost as if it was really 2.0 mono.""ten:thirty"" was boring. A collection of home movies shot during recording with the band doing mostly nothing, edited with short commments by the band members.Also, couldn't they have included some music videos from ""The Eleventh Hour"" as bonus material.If ""Jars Of Clay"" is reading this review, they might want to consider hiring an experienced crew to film, edit, and mix the concert, and an experienced DVD author for better navigation."
4,A good representaion of Kitaro's early works,"I always like Kitaro's earlier works the best, up to about the mid 80's or so. This is a nice, mellow,melodic, flowing album that was very much the style of Kitaro at the time. This is probably his third best studio album after Ki and Tunhaung. There are several versions of this album, but if you can find the original analog recording, you will be richly rewarded. The newest remixed/remastered version is a bit edgey and slightly bright, which does not help this otherwise relaxing album."
4,"This album is a ""OASIS"" for kitaro-fans !","When I first came over this album for many years ago,I felt that this was MY kind of music!(this was the first I`ve ever heard from Kitaro)The music takes you away to dreamland,and you get SO relaxed..! (Beautiful!) from the very first note... Buy it,you will not regret!!!"
2,Mediocre at best,"Kitaro never quite gets 'it'. The 'it' a Jarre, Vangelis, Schulze did get in those days. Oasis is a bit cheesy, a bit too commercial, too clinical, can't lay my finger on it, it seems to be missing a 'soul'. Maybe in the 70's this sounded great, but nowadays it just very very dated.Granted, a few nice songs such as 'Rising Sun' and 'Aqua' (for two songs it gets two stars), but mainly elevator music, best soon forgotten.Btw, the beginning of 'Rising Sun' and 'Floating' from the album Moondawn by Klaus Schulze are eerily similar. What's that about mr. Kitaro?Well, maybe Schulze got it from Kitaro. He produced the Japanese 'Far East Family Band', of which kitaro was a member, and Moondawn was inspired by the Far East Family Band."
2,Sons of Volta,"BB are one of those try-too-hard-to-be-edgy indie bands who, deservedly so, got some attention with this release. It is almost a shame that they put so much stock into the attention-grabbing vocals, because it's obvious the band has more going for it then gimmicks. As it stands, they sound like the bastard offspring of Mindless Self Indulgence and Sleater-Kinney."
1,Not their best work,"I'm a huge Blood Brothers fan. HOWEVER-- Crimes is a terribly commercialistic release lacking creativity and the Blood Brothers usual spark. I'll admit Burn Piano Island, Burn was also a rather commercialistic, mainstream (as mainstream as someone like the Blood Brothers can get) release, however, It did have at least 3 songs I liked a lot-- Though it also contained the WORST song to ever be produced: Denver Max. Aside from these two releases the Blood Brothers have always been an amazing trio-- with excellent works such as This Adultry is Ripe and my personal favorite release of theirs-- March On Electric Children. My advice: If you're getting into the Blood Brothers, buy their previous releases."
4,Pop into hardcore equals pop flavored hardcore,"A great hardcore record, infused with exceptional pop hooks amidst the creative chaos.The poetic, surreal and slightly disturbing lyrics will take you places.Let it."
2,Hmmmm....... What happened?,"This cd has some stuff that I really like and some stuff that I really hate. I like how they experimented with new sounds and hip-hop beats. My favorite song is LIVE AT THE APOCALYPSE CABARET. Another good one is WOLF PARTY. Besides that the album pretty much sucks. Its really plain and simple. All the songs sound the same and the lyrics arent written as good as their previous albums. I would recommend MARCH ON THE ELECTRIC CHILDREN as their best album. Also BURN PIANO ISLAND, BURN. This one is just not as good. It does'nt even compare. If your a fan of previous Blood Brothers cd's, then dont be surprised if you hate this one."
1,Wow...,"Bad music. End of story. I don't care who you are. You can't actually listen to this and enjoy it. Music like this is just a shiny badge that scene kids and chain-smoking art school dropouts can wear to say, ""Yeah, I listen to stuff like, The Blood Brothers, The Fall of Troy, The Locust, you know..."" If you haven't heard this, please take my word that it is crap and it will make you a gross, ugly person!"
5,dAng 4 stars not five,"this album is earslittingly awesome but has some weaker tracksNOT AS GOOD AS THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUM,"" BURN PIANO ISLAN, BURN"" which is absolutely bb's greatest work with not a single wasted moment...................go here to the whole CRIMES album online for freee:http://flashenhanced.com/bloodbrothers/#"
5,brilliance.,"crimes is absolutely the best album of the year, no questions asked. the BB have transcended all attempts to pigeon-hole them into a genre, and have brought a brilliant energy to the scene that buries everybody else. cant wait for an east coast show, its killing me! experimental genius. maximum ownage."
2,Fallen heroes?,"I don't think this album is that great. I really wanted to love it, but couldn't. I am a Blood Brothers fan, hell... I live in Redmond where they are from. But this disc is not as good as the last one at all. Yes, I am glad that they are growing as musicians and trying new things, but this disc is not that great. It doesn't have the intensity and complexity of the last album, also Johnny's voice becomes a little to much to take on the record. His high pitched squeals sound much like Karen-O, and makes me want to turn of the disc. A few songs are good, And yes the Blood Brothers are great but I'm not going to give a disc a high rating unless it really deserves it."
5,awesome,"I've known about the blood brothers for a while now. and i liked the few songs that i had from them. but other than that, i didnt really put much thought into it. But last weekend I saw them live in Austin playing with Coheed and Cambria and mewithoutYou. The Blood Brothers put on the craziest show ever. I mean, you've heard the songs, now just imagine singing them right in front of you...it's crazy as hell. These guys are original and every song catches my attention right away. I dont even care if you dont like them or want to buy their cd's (i bought all 4 at the show). I just wrote this cause I feel like I need to tell everyone how great they are. ok im done here."
4,Celebrate the Blood Brothers!,"Crimes is awesome! I wasn't expecting it to be as good as ..Burn Piano Island... but I was wrong. Not only is it shorter and catchier than BPIB, you can listen to this cd all the way through without skipping a track. I couldn't really do that on their previous cd because each track was a little too long, but the blood brothers fixed that on Crimes. The vocals on this cd are crazy, too. They are really high and catchy and fit perfectly into some of the tracks. Trash Flavored Trash, Rats and Rats and Rats For Candy and Crimes are among their best songs on any of their cds. Keep up the good work, boys."
4,NOT TO BE MISSED,"Little gem directed by John Sturges in 1956. With Richard Widmark and Donna Reed. A man searches for the murderer of his father and discovers that, if there's a murderer, it's in fact his own father. Set in the beautiful deserts of Arizona. You can now find a superb zone 2 DVD of this movie, with a rare interview of Richard Widmark, at Amazon.fr. A movie that should be rediscovered. Now."
1,DON'T BUY! History of unfixable lockups!,"I've had my Sansa c140 for just over a year. Several times it has locked up, and I've managed to get it working again. Now it won't connect to my computer, all text is missing from the menus, and tech support isn't responding. (Being out of warranty, they probably won't.)From what I've seen, this is a common problem, with no fix posted. Personally, I will avoid Sansa products in the future. I will certainly NOT buy another one of these!"
1,Mine's frozen...,"I've had my C140 for a few months now with no problems - no distortion issues no trouble moving files to it. HOWEVER, with doing absolutely nothing to it, my C140 is now frozen. I can power it off but it's as if the hold button is on. I can't forward to the next track, reverse to the last track - play and pause do nothing... It's stuck at 1:06 of the last song I played. It's toast..."
5,Sansa MP3 player,great little MP3 player.. the kids can figure it out and have a great time listening to their own music. great product for a great price!!
3,Good MP3 player with slow transfer rate in Media Player 11,"SanDisk makes solid mp3 players. This one is no exception. The only disappointment is the extremely slow transfer rate when syncing the c140 in Windows Media Player 11. If songs are simply copied to the device as a USB portable drive (look in Windows explorer), then the transfer is much faster and easier. Other than the slow transfer rate, the controls are easy to use and the device does what it is supposed to do."
3,Okay for the price......,"Its an okay mp3 player. I like it. Its easy to use and easy to travel with. What I don't like about it is the triple A battery thing. I use my mp3 player A LOT, and I go through so many batteries it isn't funny. I'm thinking about selling it and getting a different model. Maybe one from the Sandisk Sansa e200 models. They are better and guess what?! They have a rechargeable battery. So if you don't plan to use this mp3 player often then by all means buy it. But if you're like me, find another brand!"
1,good concept poor execution,When this unit works it is a great idea.Mine froze up on me and I was forced to return it.
4,Excellent gadget for the price!,"I love this mp3 player. I just fire it up and go with it. very compact and easy to carry around all day. I put the lanyard around my neck put in the earphones and listen all day at work. I have never used the voice recorder or picture function so I only gave it 4 stars. I had my songs loaded onto it and working in 5 minutes. Only need basic windows skills to load music on it. Very easy for those of us who hate Itunes and all the nonsense of an Ipod. Sound quality is very acceptable to me. I understand I could plunk down alot more money and get a better product, but for someone who just wants something that is easy to use, low maintenance, and plays all their music I highly recommend this little guy here."
1,SanDisk c-140 Review,"We purchased this product as a Christmas gift. The MP3 player arrived, but did not include the very necessary CD which contains the ""Sansa Media Converter"" software so that we could put pictures onto it, nor the even more important ""User's Manual."" It had obviously been repackaged into a different box from its original packaging. Very frustrating."
3,It's pretty cool.,"I really can't review this cuz I bought it for my niece for XMAS. And she thanked me of course, but she never told me how good or bad it is."
2,You Can Get Better Quality Somewhere elese,"I have another SanDisk 512mb mp3 player. After the headphones went out and the face plate got smashed on this mp3 player, I was eager for an upgrade.I've had this one for about a month, this was a Christmas gift to myself. The headphones has already gone out on this (this is a pattern in there mp3 players). You can't turn it up very loud. It's easy to navigate and transfer music but there are other mp3 players that have the same features and do more better than SanDisk. Yes, you can put pictures on the mp3 player, I would avoid doing so seeming that the screen is extremely small."
5,What's playing in YOUR ears?,"I bought this originally because my library offers a free download service of books on tape via MP3. I had more space than I needed for just the books, however, so I put my favorite songs on it and still had room to store some of my favorite Guided Meditations. I can go out at break and unwind to music, listen to a book, or be guided into relaxation, all at my finger tips with a player that fits in my pocket.The only thing I didn't like were the ear buds, but that's just me. I don't like things sticking in my ears, but the player was adaptable to any earphones I could find, and also hooks up to a small set of speakers so that I can listen to my tunes while working on the computer as well."
2,NOT THE BEST,I LIKE THE SIZE BUT THE DOWNLOAD TIME IS SOOOO SLOW. I BOUGHT ANOTHER SAN DISK MP3 PLAYER AND IT IS 10 TIMES AS FAST AND WAS MUCH CHEAPER.
1,Freezes,"I read many reviews on this product and I saw a few that said the product froze on many customers. I thought to myself, ""Oh well, sucks to be those peope...""Unfortunately SUCKS TO BE ME. I purchased this mp3 player and the very next day it froze at the front title screen. I tried everything from restarting, new batteries, etc. but nothing would work. It continued to freeze at the title screen.Word of advice to SanDisk, RECALL THIS PRODUCT OR YOUR GOING TO LOSE MANY CUSTOMERS!"
3,not so simple,"Came fast but with no instructions. Not so easy to figure out. Overall, good sound quality and holds over 200 songs. Good enough for my 10 year old."
3,Good machine... right up until the display went blank,"I bought this to take with me on business travel. It's small enough to fit into a shirt pocket. The battery lasts a long time with the volume cranked way up to cover jet engine noise. I've been having a problem with it lately where the back light won't work properly. (or much at all) It still plays fine, but the back light will flicker for a while and then not come on at all during play. It's a bit annoying, but the songs still keep playing. I'm an electrical engineer, so I may attempt to pull it open and take a look, but it's already small enough to require the use of a microscope. It was never designed to play video, but having thumbnails of your kids with you in a little MP3 toy is pretty cool. (until the back light died)"
1,Virus on the CD (white box version),"I purchased a ""White Box"" version of the player and the driver/software CD that came with it had W32.Perlovga.A virus on it, which infected my machine. The virus is very difficult to remove. It can be identified by Norton AV, but can not be cleaned. If you do get infected, virus removal is a manual and very painful process.BEWARE!!!"
2,Only if you want an disposable MP3 player,I bought this for my 14yr old son. After 3 months it froze and would no longer work. SanDisk should be ashamed for producing products that are disposable after only a few months!
5,Very pleased,I recieved this item in time for christmas i was very pleased with that when i presented the gift the person loved it and was very happy with the overall performance of the gift i was very pleased and thankful thanks to amazon for everything and for making my holiday shopping more easier.
5,Awesome little MP3,"I love this mp3 player. I bought one each for myself and my 11 year old daughter for Chrismtas this year and got them both for $[...] on sale. I am amazed at how great the sound quality is, how reliable it is, and how much music can be fit on the product. It is not necessary to have an iPod nano or another player with more memory capacity since I can easily move songs from and to the player with Windows Media. I don't regret getting this at all and am so glad I did!"
3,"Good, but not excellent","Good product, but it is too slow. The device processor is not as fast as it should. It takes too much time to change a song or to do anything with it. Beyond that, it is a good product for the price."
1,Frozen mp3 player,"the player froze up after about a week worked with tech support downloaded patch, still had to order replacement. Replacement did the same thing within a week. Went out and bought an RCA mp3 player for the same price. Really suprised an sandisk product usually are good."
3,Good,Its been 3 months since I have bought the Sandisk and playing well. But I noticed that some songs that have been copied from directly from CDs using Rhapsody do not play very. Has some disturbance. But other than its good.. plays well and good for rough use
2,OK if you ignore the FM abilities,"I bought this player mainly for its FM recording abilities. I have an Ipod that i use for most everything in my library. So for under $100 i thought this would be great for what i needed. I was wrong. When the backlight turns off the sound on the FM is drown out by an annoying hum. This also travels over to recording. You can leave the backlight on all the time, but that will just eat power like no tommorow. Sadly disappointing becasue it seems this is the same on all this model not just the one I had. Dont by it for FM anything! Get a Creative Labs Zen Nano Plus like I did - cheaper & it works!"
2,I was very unhappy,"What can I say. I purchased not once but twice and not because I liked it. I first bought it about a month ago and was really happy with it and all of its features. However, after just one month it locked up on me and wouldn't do anything. I returned the item and thought maybe I just got a defective product and gladly replaced it with the same product. This however was a huge mistake since this one locked up on me after just one day. I returned the item and bought a completely different mp3 player. I hope this helps anyone who is potenially going to buy this product."
3,Sansa!!,"I love sansa products and I brought this one for my mom it was ok but i didn't like that the batteries seemed to drain quickly. No matter if they were duracell, energizer, or a generic. they all seemed to be drain too fast."
1,"Froze up completely, after three months","Used the player for about three months. Worked good. Then one day when I turned it on, it froze up completely--pressing the controls had no effect on the display or operation of the player. I tried a new battery. No effect. The only way to turn it off now is to take out the battery. I will never buy a SanDisk product again."
3,Sound quality is not very good,I bought this for my lectures for school. The sound quality is not very good. Some of the words in the lecture wouldn't sound right. They would sound like a blurbed word and it did happen often. It made it pretty difficult to understand the lectures.
5,Durability,"This leash has held up like a champ with almost no wear and tear, and it looks nice. What more is there to say?"
5,Flight of Grey Wolf,I was delighted with this video. The color and sound portion of this VHS tape was very good. I had never heard of this movie before and I enjoyed it very much.
1,Not that great,"I felt this book was very simplistic and not much of an advantage for getting ""Straight A's"". It was an ok review, but really no earth shattering info that would put you over the edge. Don't waste your money!"
3,Not a quick fix to study woes (I am a nursing student).,"This study guide was well put together, but basically, for me it wasn't very useful. Someone (who has since dropped out of nursing school after coming back a second time) recommended it to me, and I thought it would make it easier for me to study. This was not the case. The material I learned and had to study at my college did not really match what was included in the CD and book, so it was a waste. Basically there is no easy way around spending 3-4 hours minimum (in addition to class time)studying notes and books per day as a nursing student. If you wanted to study this as a supplement to what you're already doing, then great, but otherwise it will not get you ""straight a's"". I worked my butt off just studying books and notes (without this), and it really payed off, as I passed my second semester of nursing school with B's (very good accomplishment since a ""B"" is between 85-91 percent in our program)."
3,description was accurate,there was no writing on the pages...very cheap price for a book in pretty good condition
1,Avoid This Dictionary,"I picked up this dictionary to travel around Latin America. If you only need the most basic vocabulary, it might do the job. But anything beyond that is asking too much. You'll soon get frustrated looking for words and expressions that simply aren't to be found, but which any basic Spanish-English dictionary should contain.The format of the book is great - slender, and with a durable cover. But the disadvantages are just too great. I'd recommend going for a slightly bulkier, but more comprehensive dictionary. You'll get much more out of it."
2,Disappointing and Limited Dictionary,"If you are looking for good, reliable pocket Spanish dictionary, this is NOT it. I have found myself frustrated multiple times when looking up simple words that I have considered returning it. It has some good things to offer like nationalities and verb conjugations, but it is quite limited in its vocabulary. I would not recommend it, but rather I would recommend Berlitz pocket dictionaries to anyone wanting to learn another language."
4,Language Lover,"I'm currently taking a Spanish class and have found this to be a very useful tool. All the text is black and white but it is very clearly printed and the words you're looking up are in bold print. Love the size, fits well in my purse. Also has a useful grammar section in the middle including a mini conjugation guide. Also love the material that the cover is made of and actually purchased this particluar dictionary because it had a ""turtleback"" cover instead of paperback. It's kind of like a plastic that you could easily wipe off if it gets dirty. My only complaint is that when my instructor asked me to look up a word that should have given me ""shower head"" it said watering can, but everyother time I've looked up a word it has been accurate and 90% of the time it does have the word I'm looking for (my level is intermediate-three years in highschool and this is the second semester long college course I have taken, the first was 10 years ago.)"
4,McRackins Rule,The best thing about this movie is that Vancouver's Pop Punkers The McRackins are in it. Playing a few songs in a bar scene.
1,Worst shoes to wear!,"They may look cute, but I tell you do not buy them! Only unless you wear them for less than an hour. These shoes are for really wide feet. Which mine just swam in them, and they were super uncomfortable! You must order a whole size smaller. The first time I wore them the strap ripped off. I'm stuck with shoes I can't wear. Heck I even bought Dr. Scholls insoles and they were still uncomfortable to wear. I'm disappointed that they are cute and you can't even wear them. Aren't many shoes like that. I love demonia but I don't love these shoes."
5,A family's journey,"Reading this book is the equivalent of sitting in your living room and speaking face to face with Judy Lecuyer. I have had the privilege of doing both. Judy has written in ""plain speak"" about the amazing journey they are on with their middle son Ben. While so many would accept the diagnosis with defeat, the whole Lecuyer family has risen to the occasion with love, and a willingness to see the miracles and not just accept the negatives that society heaps on in piles.While I personally have had very little knowledge of the subject of Autism other then the stereotypes, I found this an eye-opener into that world. I believe that you will enjoy meeting this family."
3,Still a dummy,"It is freggin hard to be a vegetarian in a meat eating world that is for sure. It is a good read, but you have got to be motivated to go meatless. I have not gotten there yet."
4,"great contents, but confusing coverage","this book surprisingly covers most, if not all the stuff for the exam, but the author's way of presentation could be rather confusing. some terms were introduced without definitions, and you could end up going back and forth in order to get what the guys are saying. overall, it's a great book, but it needs to be re-written to make it easier to follow. but for this, it deserves five stars."
3,An imperfect enterprise,"This book is a good road map to Danish...it does an excellent job of explaining grammar and sentence structure.What makes it frustrating for a beginner like me, however, is the way it approaches vocabulary. I've learned several other languages, and I like to learn new nouns in groups (""animals"" ""professions"" ""rooms of the house"")This book throws huge groups of unrelated words at you as it goes about explaining sentence structure, and I found them almost impossible to keep straight.I ended up keeping a separate notebook to organize them myself!Another important point: Pronunciation is the most difficult part of Danish, so I'd recommend buying this book WITH the cassettes. I bought the book alone, and now to get the cassettes - which are really necessary - I'm going to have to buy another copy of the book!"
2,Crooked,"These sunglasses were crooked from the beggining. I took them to a store to see if it could be fixed, but didn't change much. Big mistake to buy glasses over the internet."
5,She Pendray Inventive Needlework,"I loved the book, Great photos and ideas. Very inspiring for any stitcher. A really great additional to your library"
2,Not impressed!,"This book has some lovely pictures and has instructions that are rather clear... However, I have an issue with the book! The author has spent a number of years traveling to Japan and includes MANY references to that fact. <good for her!> Included in her instructions are several hard to find and expensive items that the average individual will have no access to. The book is called INVENTIVE Needlework but I found the examples to be common embroidery techniques... EXCEPT when you can do them on extremely expensive silk fabrics from Japan. EXPENSIVE Needlework may have been a more truthful title!"
1,Good Text Bad Paper,The text of the book is excellent but the publisher printed it on poor quality paper that turns yellow over time. The print quality is also horrible. The book is a classic so it deserves to be printed on good quality paper.
4,The Cloud of Unknowing,"The book was received in excellent condition and expediently.The contents were good, but some of it was a little bit too deep for me.Somebody with a great amount of Christian knowledge could probably handle the book a little easier."
4,Good starting point for pythoneers,"This is a nice beginners textbook for Python which deals with many deatails, so that it is also valuable for people who already know Python. Still it is not reaching up to the highest branches of Python art. That would be the task of a massively revised second edition of the other Lutz book: ""Programming Python"". And it has to be said: Python is a great language!"
3,beginning python,"Well this book is a decent reference on how to use python the older version. If the book would have had an input statement or two to make it more interactive, the book would have been great!A couple of simple practical examples, that you can see the out come of a file that you saved. The interpreter is okay, but you would like to see a simple example using the input statement to make interesting.."
1,learning python,"unlike other people who had such a wonderful experience with the book, mine was a complete disaster.The first chapter was dedicated to running the program, and modules files, in the second chapter author would give a code example and end it with comments like"" we will explain the concept in later chapters"" that turned me off cause if you going to use an example expalin it or give an example that's pertains with the chapter. furthermore, later chapters of the book, were written with sample code with no Explanation at all. what good is it going to do me? a code without Explanation.. Anyway i am looking for a more detailed book on python. If anyone can help me out please post a note. thanks"
1,Learning Python?,"I purchased the Mark Lutz's first book, Programming Python, and found it impossible to comprehend. So then I heard about a new book called learning Python, which was more of a tutorial-style book. I bought it immediately, eager to learn the language which I have heard so much about, and to my dissapointment, it seemed to be the same as Programming Python, only shorter. If you really want to learn a programming language, get Learning Perl by Randal Schwartz and Tom Christiansen. Good luck!"
2,No help to me as a beginner,"Though this book has often been recommended as an excellent source for beginning programmers, I didn't get much from it after the first chapter.I found the writing excessively dry, the index substandard, the and the language very very opaque. The organization is also pretty haphazard. Quite often concepts are introduced briefly and off-handedly, but then dropped as ""not quite ready"" to be discussed, with no further reference given.Most of the examples used to demonstrate basics are either trivial or very abstract. A set of well-thought-out, useful examples are missing from this book, and if they had been included, would have gone a long way towards showing a beginner how to use this language.Generally, not up to O'Reilly standards."
4,"Good introduction to Python, but don't buy it","Lutz's book is a pretty good coverage of the material, and is worthy of the O'Reilly name. However, you're even better off buying Harms & McDonald's ""The Quick Python Book"", published by Manning. It's less dry, more interesting, and just a better book."
3,Slowly Paced,"If your goal is to get up to speed quickly with Python this might not be the book for you. Especially if you already have programming experience then you are better off downloading the documentation from python.org. That documentation covers the same material but much more succinctly. For example, in the reference manual at python.org, the ""while"" statement is described in less than a dozen lines of text, while in ""Learning Python"" it drags on across multiple pages.The advantage of ""Learning Python"" is this: (1) the author shares the style and idioms that experienced Python programmers would use; and (2) the author offers insight into the history and design of the language. This allows the reader to ""taste"" the language as well as learn it. But for a quick path to learning Python, I would recommend using the website's documentation."
3,"Not bad, but...","Can't really describe precisely what's wrong with this book. I've been programming, and picking up languages, for 25 years. This book didn't do anything for me... so I just started writing some code. At some point the light went on and Python was magically easy. Now, as I need to help some other people learn Python I'm looking back through the book and NOW it looks great - covers the key details, describes them well, warns you about pitfalls, etc. In short, everything I'd like to present as a trainer (and I know it grew out of the authors' experiences as trainers). But it didn't work at all for me as a newbie."
2,An average book at best,"This book is a terribly lazy attempt at writing a Python tutorial.Sure, you can read it from start to finish, and write yourself some working Python code. However, when you want to write something slightly different to what is covered in this book, you suddenly realise how incomplete this book is.Eg, it covers the hasattr, getattr, setattr, and delattr built in functions, which is fine if you already know what attributes an object has, but in no way can I work out with this book how, or if it is even possible, to get a list of an object's existing attributes.It is incredibly frustrating trying to learn Python from this book. I am writing this review because I came online to look for a better Python book. I was hoping to find something by the Wrox publishers, as their Beginning Java2 is excellent, but it looks like I am out of luck..."
5,Best Python Book To Start With,"This is a wonderful introductory book to Python for people with a (small) background in programming. Significantly more readable than Programming Python, this volume succinctly relates what you need to know without bogging down in extended examples or tedious details. From here the online references take over or, like a true hacker, you can just start reading source code. Together with the upcoming Python Cookbook, this is all you need to buy to be productive in the best language you are ever likely to meet. Nice rat, too."
5,Excellent introduction to Python for experienced programmers,"Not recommended for newbie programmers since the authors assume a knowledgeable reader. But for experienced programmers who have used other languages, the excercises at the end of each chapter serve to inculcate unique Python characteristics in your mind quickly. I like the abstract approach better than the wordy 'learn-by-doing-examples' approach which I believe just creates fluff in a book. It would be accurate to call this book a 'Learn Python in X days' and at the end of those X days you can truly say that you do know Python (the language) very well. But this is a testament to Python's simplicity & lack of idiosyncracies as well."
4,Interesting,"A little difficult to understand from a web perspective shifting to programming, but not too bad. However, I have to wonder why O'Reilly chose a rat as opposing to a python? I thought the snake would make more sense. Oh, well, back to the book. This would probably be more useful to someone who has more programming experience and not just some scripting and HTML which is what I had when I started the book."
5,still a good read,"Having read this book a couple of years ago, I still browse through it frequently. David presents a gentle intro for the Python beginner but I appreciate the quick summaries of modules and methods. In fact, I reference this book a lot more than my ""Essential Python Reference"". Buy this book for a good intro to the language and keep it around for future reference."
1,Horrible documentary!,I guess you'd have to be on drugs to get this. Collectors will need it for the collection but this documentary was absurd. A big waste of time. I found myself wanted to fast forward often. I expected more from Nikolas Schrek.
3,Mask or history,"Very interesting but poorly edidted. Alot of mistakes.Just one is the man says Lennon wrote ""Helter Skelter"" when everone knows it was Paul McCartney wrote the song."
1,Evil director with an evil subject= trash!,"What a piece of garbage! As a fan of true crime, I was hoping for something interesting. I was wrong. All I got out of this is the director being a fan of Charles Manson, a supporter of the church of satan, and garbage making Manson look like some sort of folk hero. And the backgroud sounds of people chanting ""praise satan"" was twisted and went on a little too long in my opinion. Subliminal?? Charles Manson is a scum who, along with his killer family, belongs in jail the rest of their lives! Charles babbles on and on and on and on and never makes a bit of sense. This is nothing more than trash!"
3,OK - more dramatic than I expected,"Lots of moody looks take the place of action or actual progress. Cassell is very good in both movies, as usual."
5,dont hesitate,"this is so avant garde in disguise, such an understated jewel.mix the best you know of john cale's voice and insight with the flight of scott walker and look at it thru a post post enoesque optique."
5,dont hesitate,understated avantgard. enoesque inspiration. john cale's type of voice and inspiration with a touch of scott walker flight...
4,One of the best CDs I own,"It is an excellent CD and if it weren't for itunes and the like, I'd give this CD 5 stars as a ""Must Have"". However, in retrospect I'd now get online and download my most favorite songs on this CD: High, Broken Loves, and She Saw the World. Then I'd go and get Downtown Lights, Headlights on the Parade from the CD Hats...and my world would be right."
4,Blue Nile is in a genre all their own,"We discovered the Blue Nile 20 years ago and were very pleased to find that they've continued to produce wonderful music in High. The third track ""I would never"" and ""Because of Toledo"" are standouts in a remarkable album."
3,Not So High,"Coming along roughly every eight years, each release by The Blue Nile is greeted as manna from heaven. High is only their fourth release since 1984, and while the return of Paul Buchanan's gorgeously melancholy voice is welcome, this set of nine songs is a mixed blessing. ""Because of Toledo"" is a songwriting low - the title used as a metaphorical scan but without meaning in the narrative. ""Soul Boy"" is a trifle that barely registers - its delivery is so hushed it evaporates instantly. And there's a high ratio of nostalgia here; Buchanan, in song after song, is continuously looking back at better days. That said, the ache in his voice is a wonder to me. ""The Days of Our Lives"", ""I Would Never"", and ""Stay Close"" are as good as anything on Hats. And regardless of what he's singing, he has the ability to make you want to break down and cry. Repeatedly."
3,K is OK,"This is a drama about the relationships between the people in a neighborhood of a small town and in the hospital where some of them work. I found the first half of the book to be a bit drawn out and uninteresting, but it improves in the second half. The author gets in a wide variety of things- jealousy, revenge, unrequited love, murder, family ties, mystery. She does a good job of getting inside of people's heads. If you have spare time this book is OK to read, but if you pass it by you aren't missing all that much."
1,typical pseudoscience,"Some people are able to believe in everything what seems to be logic and supported by some equations and statistics.It is really funny that even the wildest theory will always find its followers.Russian science has problem with pseudoscientists. For instance: Lysenko, Michurin in the agrobiology and now Famenko in history.Maybe in the next volumes of his revised version of history he will try to convince us that:- Jews are the descendants of merchants who did not pay taxes regullary and were expelled from the Novogrod.- Ethiopians are the descendants of the miners (that's why they are black) who escaped from the coal mines, which were placed in Ural. But one of them remained in Russia and later he became the gradfather of Alexander Pushkin.- Asians are the descendants of peepers or spies (that's why they have eyes with an epicanthic fold) who were unmasked and left Russia.Because everything can be proved with statistics."
4,Veery disturbing,"This is a very disturbing book. The author proves with astronomical data and statistical analysis of ancient documents that the history of humankind is drastically shorter (!) than consensual chronology suggests. The book contains an abundance of chunky facts for a prying mind. Hard to say farewell to history of Antiquity, Bronze Age and Middle ages as we (thought to) know it. Definitely a must, but prepare to baad surprises!"
1,A very strange book...,"I should admit that maybe I did not read this specific book by Fomenko, but I tried to read one of his books in the original Russian. I quit after reading a third of it: besides being a bogus hypothesis, the book lists some interpretations of Hebrew words to support the theory, and, being familiar with Hebrew, I would state that these interpretations are very dubious, if not outrightly ignorant, thus casting the shade of incompetence upon the entire 'opus'. The theory also smells strongly by the Soviet-style nationalistic racism that would not accept other (inferior) nations achievements, history or even existance. A queer book indeed..."
1,NONSENSE,"WE ALL KNOW THAT STATISTICS IS A METHOD OF INTERPRETATION.THERE ARE DOZENS OF BOOKS NAMED ""LYING WITH STATISTICS"""
5,Good HO Track,"I have this track on my HO Train Layout. No problems yet, stays together nice and smooth operation with my trains. Just ensure you clean the track frequently."
4,Classic moral lesson,"This movie, along with the original Godzilla, is the undisputed king of the Japanese monster movies. It actually has a moral concerning atmoic bomb testing and what Nature does to retalitate. Touching finale where the surviving Pteranodan creature dives into the lava to die with its mate, the last of their once mighty species. None of the later, dumbed down Toho films compare to this. Japanese Monster Movies Rule! P.S. Obviously, they had time to reproduce because later on in Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla II , another Rodan is discovered. I use that as an example because I just don't buy the way it was revived in the 60's and 70's Toho films."
4,Japanese Monster pictures,Rodan is a fine example fo the early Japanese monster picture with anti-atomic sentiments. The great part about the film is the naration by the miner who's story and family is intertwined with the story of Rodan. It is the naration that does so much to set the erie feel of this film.
2,"Entertaining movie, bad DVD","Rodan remains one of the most entertaining of all Japanese monster movies, with nice color photography and more consistent special effects than the original Godzilla. This DVD, though, is a disappointment. The print that was used is by no means the cleanest you'll ever find--lots of scratches and dirt on the image--and there really aren't any extras. No effort appears to have been made to find better source material, and that makes for a less-than-stellar DVD experience. They could have done much better."
4,Well Done,"This movie is much better than Godzilla King of the Monsters. Not only the movie itself but the picture quality is much better as well. Not one but two prehistoric, flying reptiles hatch beneath a coal mine and proceed to raise havok on Japan. Not as high tech as todays pictures but a very entertaining monster movie of the classic era."
3,Laughable entertainment,"Rodan in my opinion falls into a foriegn film with a good laugh. The concept is enjoyable, I can get into the story line, just to bad it was made at a time with no good special affects, a lot of these older films should be remade without changing the story line, just with better actors."
2,Subtitles? Original Japanese language track? Didn't think so,"I've always been a big fan of all the Toho monster movies and had been awaiting this DVD release with baited breath. Would this be the one to finally feature an option to watch the movie in Japanese with English subtitles? Evidently not. I'm tired of these great movies being reduced to cheap B flicks by virtue of awful dubbing, re-editing and the deletion of music cues. It's time they were seen as originally intended. I've been lucky enough to see subtitled copies of many of the Godzilla movies... all of them brilliant.But these tacky dubbed versions drain all the soul out of them... and are an insult to the great filmmaker's who put them together in the first place. I'm tempted to learn Japanese and buy the official Toho releases."
5,GREAT!,"O.K this is a realy cool movie, as in that NO Godzilla collection is complet without the mighty RODAN! This monster film ranks up with all those cool monster movies like Gojira; Detsroy All Monsters; Mothra; Gamera Gardiean Of The Univers. what ever you do, try to track down a copy of RODAN don't mind any price, in other words if you see this film for sale ANYWHERE grab it, you won't be disaponted!"
4,Big Hit,"I bought Rodan for my nephews 5th birthday and it was a big hit. Thanks to you I'm his favorite aunt. The product was processed and shipped out in a timely manner. Very happy with quality of toy.Thank you,Patricia Bologna"
4,Like Godzilla!,This movie was just like godzilla movies in all ways. For one it's in color. Then theres giant insects and not only one rodan but two! Perfect for a family movie.
2,"Glossy, but some interesting details","Unlike the recent book by Tina Sinatra (which I give five-stars) this book softsells any of FAS's well known liabilities. Nonetheless, it does contain some interesting details about his life. My one complaint is that Nancy Sinatra's other book ""Frank Sinatra, American Legend"" seems to be indistiguishable from this one, and indeed contains 80% of the same material yet was not published as a revision. This, earlier version is better in my mind because of her notes about each of his movies and albums at the end of the book. That material is missing in the American Legend version. Given her softsell, I do have to wonder what Nancy has to say about her sisters more forthright approach to their father's story."
2,This book is not detailed enough.,You will find yourself refering to Novells website to get full explainations and instructions on how to do things refereced in the book. (thats unacceptable to me) I was disappointed with this purchase. Novells online manuals contain far more information and its free.
3,starwarsson,I'm happy with the poster. The clarity is great. I recommend products from this buyer. My son approves. Thanks!
2,Built well ... But Not RELAX FIT,"The title says relaxed fit carpenter jeans....well they are not a relax fit. The waist is the right size, but there is almost no room in the leg and crotch area!!! I purchased 2 pair because they were a good price but even at under $20 a pair what good is it if they are so uncomfortable. Also make sure you wash them twice before you wear. Even using fabric softener they are very harsh."
3,Not true Levi quailty,I just love these pants they are comfortable and I think a few more pairs are on the horizon for me but in a different color
1,poor fit,"poor fit, non functional pockets, look like 5 dollar thrift store jeans. Wranglers are much much better for the same price."
4,Not up for the weight.,I'm a regular size of guy but am hard on jeans with my daily work. These jeans have been real good in the past; they fit well with flexing space and have held up as well as top name brands. These pants this time are not as heavy a cloth weight as I thought it would be compared to past. I got what I paid for a little cheaper some place in the manufacturing. Time will tell if they hold in there but with winter coming in now I will have over pants over them all winter and will not see the wear and tear that summer does. I did see that the stock number of the pant was different then the last ones I bought so...I was thinking something had to be different other then the savings of $7 a pair. But I did enjoy the free shipping!
3,"Nice Jeans, fit well, but they have a knack for getting wrinkled","Not much to say about them, I like the color & fit, etc -- that stuff is more of a personal taste issue, so it's not worth discussing much. However...My one issue with these jeans is they always seem to be extremely wrinkled when I take them out of the washer. None of my other jeans (assorted big-name brands) have this problem; it's just this pair in particular. I don't know if it's the material, thickness, or what, but it's a bit annoying. One of the nice things about (other) jeans is they generally don't need ironing, so that kind of thing diminishes their value somewhat."
3,I do not like that jeans,"The material of the jeans is very rigid, the packets are usefull, but to tell the truth I don't like this jeans. It has a very loose fit, it looks very old fashioned on me. It cost me anouther 5dollars by taking it to a tailor to correct the shape. But after the correction it is still not my taste. May be beacuse of the rigidity of the material.It worths the price but I won't choose this kind of fit again."
3,their work pants,not enough belt loops on the back side. do you really require more words or are you just justifying your job?
3,Jean review,material on jeans is thin compared to what department stores carry. Overall material seems to be holding up so far though.
4,Pants!,"these are the classic style jeans. white stitching, deep indigo color.great pants, even if they did come a little stiff. wash a few times and they soften right up. good pants."
1,Too wrinkly after washing..,Every time I wash the pants.. They are so wrinkled... I highly doubt I will be buying these again.. Not a good buy..
5,Excellent,"""Beyond a certain age, sincerity ceases to feel pornographic.""This is an excellent book. I would say that if you've read any of his other works, you would know what to expect, but that's not entirely the case; this specific work consists of several substories from parties unrelated to each other but with similar mindsets and feelings.It is a short book, and if you are a reader, you can get through it in a day or so, and this should be a fine use for a day.You should know what to expect: it is not an uplifting book, but it is an intimate book in that it delves in a unique way into the consciousness of the viewer. More detail than that would not do it justice."
4,Poignant Vignettes on life,"This is a good book, effective but not great. The series of stories as told by the disenfranchised narrator is filled with keen observations and poignant vigneetes, together forming a good carricature of the suburban lifestyle during these safe, post Cold War years where spirituality dwindles. I found the apocalyptic seres of vignette the most effective, as well as the relationship to the sister. The ending is a bit of a let down, as Coupland didn't really have a run up to the conclusion, it just appeared as a stretch."
5,"""LAG"" continues in the same brilliance as ""Generation X""","What remains to be so fascinating about ""Life After God"" is the memory it leaves behind in the reader on completion. His tendancy to delve into such insightful, thought-provoking aspects of our existence with such freshness and accuracy remains to be both eye-opening and astounding. His excellent understanding of human nature in this novel will remain to be seen and respected in many years to come. A brilliant novel."
2,This is not Coupland at his best,"As a Coupland Frequent Flyer, I almost lost perspective while I was reading this book. I had enjoyed (does anyone remember what it is like?) ""Generation X"", ""Shampoo Planet"" and ""Microserfs"" so much, that I bought ""Life After God"" without much thought. In the end, I was standing in a crossroad: Should my zest for Coupland's style rule over the randomness I had found in most of the stories (in typical brain-heart conflict)? Or should I accept that this was for Coupland what ""Almost Blue"" was for Elvis Costello? Although I don't regret buying and reading this one, I still think it pales in comparison even to cronicles like the ones he usually does for Wallpaper Magazine, so my advice is this: Buy and read this book only if you have done so with ano-ther from the ones I mention above. If you like them, welcome aboard."
2,Enough is Enough,"There were some slightly profound, thought provoking passages in this book. Being in my late 20's, naturally I could relate. But after a while, I began to wonder why it was the Mr. Coupland felt that we needed to be included in ALL of his deepest thoughts and lonely banter. I too would love for the world to read MY existential life thoughts, family secrets, and childhood memories, but does anyone really care? After awhile, I just didn't care anymore. It would have helped if this ""stories"" were collected in a more organized semblance, it seemed a bit sloppy."
2,Not Nearly So Good As I Had Hoped,"After reading ""Generation X' and ""Shampoo Planet"" I was somewhat dissappointed by this effort. The angst of the central character as a tortured father separated from a child is understandable but maudlin at times. There is something of Coupland's earlier style in the book. The childhood reminiscence of the central character recalls the author's work in ""Generation X"" and was much appreciated. The book on the whole is not the pleasure to read that his two previous works were."
4,Typical Coupland,"Life after God is a collection of short stories told in the famliar Coupland manner. As I've felt with his previous work, his work is more about expressing the feelings of the collective unconscious of his generation than actually telling a story, at least as he sees it. That's why he is probably better suited to short fiction than novels. Not for everyone, but that's Coupland for you."
2,good prose no plot,"Life After God is well written, there is no argument there (despite a few consistency errors). The problem is this nice read goes nowhere, it just delivers lots of little stories with nothing to tie them together into a cohesive whole. Coupland is good with his prose and is very easy to read, but I want more than that. And really, a plot is not too much to ask for is it?"
5,beautiful,"A huge fan of his work. Beautiful, mysterious, haunting, and yet so normal and mundane. Such a wise understanding of people"
4,"Easy, Breezy, Lite Philosophy","Everyone under thirty ought to read at least one book by Douglas Coupland, and since most are essentially the same insight repackaged some other way, why not this extended pamphlet? It's convoluted, going from one situation to the next and sometimes coming back to an earlier point, other times the story line just drifts off. The author makes it evident that his point has more to do with the theses presented than wrapping up any tedious plot. Maybe his next book should point out that the generation he targets often misses the point of art, as this is one of his books where he presents illistrations accompanied by text (Dave Eggers owes Coupland a nickel per royalty for drawing a stapler in the intro to his _Staggering Genius_), text I might add that could stand alone without the pictures, but then the book would be roughly the size of _Who Moved My Cheese?_.High recommendation for the insight, mild recommendation for the pictures, a point off for lack of closure."
4,deeply moving in a poetic way,"i just like the fact that although coupland targets a specific age range as his audience, the message of his ruminations extends far beyond into future generations similarly raised without the backdrop of religion."
5,Only out of 10 .... <sigh>,"Stepping into Douglas Couplands books is like a journey into my own mind, without the hassle. The way he brings the thoughts and feelings of his characters, and, I suspect, himself, to life is incredable to say the least. I have read this book at least 8 times, and it is a large part of how I look at the world now. The views expressed in the book mimic my own, and many of my friends so closely I could swear Douglas had known me for a lifetime. A truely inspirational book that will change your life, as it did mine"
5,xmas with larry,"With all the shlock that comes out a Christmas time, it's nice to sit down and listen to a talented musician play some very nice arrangemnets. larry never fails to amaze me with his guitar playing. This is a very comforting Christams CD to listen to duing the Holidays."
4,Christmas at my house Larry Carlton,A good selection of songs and played in a clear traditional manner true to the Christmas spirit.
5,Required reading for anyone who teaches in the real world,"The immediacy of Letters to the Living is jolting. Blitz and Hurlbert allow themselves to be caught in the act of teaching, with all of the sticky intimacy that implies. They struggle not only with how to convey the relevance of composition to students living in the real world, but with how to recompose that world through writing. Their classrooms are emptied of convention but thick with false starts, clownishness, subterfuge and magical connections. By having students author their own lives, writing becomes proactive as well as reflective.In the end, Blitz and Hurlbert teach self and other advocacy, as well as literacy."
3,"A good buy, but...","Well-made, easy-to-use, good 'click' sound rather than electronic 'beep'. Some limitations to be aware of... it's really BIG (does not fit into the neck of my guitar case). The volume is not adjustable (a problem if you're practicing with others around the house). And there's no 'mute' button... you have to switch it off and back on at the end of each run-through."
3,"Already bought two, not going back for a third","This metronome works just fine for a while, but, as some reviewers have noted, it's prone to malfunctioning later on in its life. I've bought two so far (maybe three? I can't even remember now), because after a while it just breaks down... starts beeping erratically, stops beeping, starts picking arbitrary beat values. I think for metronome #3 (or 4), I'll go with someone else."
2,perfectly adequate....until it packs up.,"6 months after i purchased this metronome, it started to malfunction quite seriously. the clicking became very erratic and unsteady, until the actual speed of the clicking differed drastically from the numerical values stated on the dial. try practising to this and you'll realise how disastrous this is!recommended ONLY if you are lucky enough not to have it give up on you."
2,Cannot read the dial...,"This metronome keeps great time, but you cannot read the dial very well. The top 2 buttons have a tendency to fall off a lot."
5,TicTic-TockTock,"Very Good - Even without headphones, this little gem will loudly help you keep the beat or pace a race which I use it for when I jog or hit the treadmill. Volume is adjustable and the LED's are another plus. Plenty of settings for speed and patterns of the tic'n and tock'n. Price is good. Reccomend!"
3,The zipbeat Metronome,"This metronome works as expected and I have no complaints about it's performance. However, you should be aware that when it arrived it was much bigger than expected and is clumsy in that respect. It also is very hard to read the numbers. The crystal is dark and very glossy and I have to stick the unit under a lamp to read the settings. Also it is unbelievably loud! I put masking tape over the speaker holes to mute it and it still is loud. It should have a volume control.Other than that it works without a flaw. Not bad for the price."
4,"Good product, easy to use, wish it had a volume control","As an older guitarist (48) who has been playing 30+ years, its great to see so many metronome choices. What I really like about this unit is that you have the large dial and its easy to set tempos rather than scrolling through a menu on a LCD screen.Two ways in which this unit could be improved - volume control as other reviewers have mentioned, and I'd like to see more of these units with belt clips, so you could clip them to your belt, plug in the earphone and walk around and practice without being tied in one room or place - or have your electric guitar overwhelmed by the ticking if you are practicing unplugged."
3,yea liar!,"It came on time, it wasnt broken, but i was not the color i asked for. The main reason i bought this product was because the display image of it shows nice purple accents, my sister favorite color. When i got it, it was a plain boring UGLY cream color."
3,Not a great first reader,"We really like Pinky Dinky Doo and I was very excited about these books. However, my daughter is a young reader and the structure of the books is choppy and hard to follow (The ABC quizzes confused her). It's a cute book, but not the best I've seen for reading practice."
5,zilmom,was on my wish list (I own love is walking hand in hand)...surprised for Christmas. Great memories of childhood. Good easy reader book. Just great Schultz work!
5,Another unexpected ending for a superb plot,"Agatha Christie once more will mesmerize your mind with the unexpected turns of this plot! When the master of the house is discovered shot in his study, the suggestion of suicide is brought forward. It satisfies everyone, but not M.Poirot! The investigation uncovers secret passions, past intrigues, and cunning plots. You don't want to miss this page turner!"
3,Quality recording but not original versions,"I love Connie's music: I think she has the most beautiful female voice of the pop era. She sings with a sense of hurt that makes her style unique and utterly compelling. It gets through to your soul like no other. I can't overstate how great I think so many of her songs are. Accordingly, several of her CDs are musts in any collection.However this particular CD regrettably is not one that I recommend because some of these songs are are not the original recordings and I just couldn't get comfortable with them. The original versions are better - sung with more feel and intensity - so I see no reason to buy this particular set of them. (I hate saying that about a Connie Francis CD!)Lovely songs but seek out the originals instead, they are readily available."
4,Enjoyable,"For those interested in reading about Colombian society, this work of fiction is a good read. Though not extremely profound, it is nevertheless entertaining."
3,Do you know... (how much you like the song?),"This is the fun and catchy first single off of Enrique's new album ""Insomniac."" The main highlight off of this single is the DJ Dan Remix of the title track. This mix if funky and full of energy, however, not all of the vocals are used in the song - just a warning to those of you out there who are only interested in mixes featuring full vocals. There are also mixes by Ralphi Rosario & Craig J, however (as far as I know) those mixes are only available on DJ Promo CD Single. I give this particular CD single 3 stars only because it lacks the other mixes of the song. However, this is still a great item for any fan of Enrique Iglesias."
3,Nice but Wears out quickly,"I've had this for about a year - not jogging, just doing the lawn, raking leaves and doing projects. Not much room for anything but the player and a couple of CDs in sleeves. It's got a front pocket that'll carry a spare battey but that's about it. It's very comfortable but the belt liner, some sort of stretch foam, is now splitting and soon to give way. Looking for something else."
3,Why should I pay for the printed source code?,"Is this a Java database programming book or just a plain database programming book? I could not quite catch the difference. There is almost nothing in this book other than endless listing of source code (about 80%???).Certainly, I can find a better JDBC book than this one."
2,not useful if you want to build db-applications,Jepson understands the topics of JDBC very well. It might be interesting for the one or the other to see how you can develop your own JDBC-driver as well as a little database. If you are looking for a tutorial how to build database-applications this book is the wrong choice.
3,Slightly above average and hastily done!,"The book starts off very promising. Halfway towards the end, it seems running out of steam. It tries to cover as much as possible but one area being left out is the MetaDatabase. The book lacks in explanation for the codes. You couldn't expect readers to hunt for other books to understand it.The author should put more examples to explain the concept rather than running the course like bullet. Include source codes together with the book."
4,"Useful, authoritative and idiosyncratic","This is an extremely useful and timely overview of database issues when the language is Java as well as a cookbook of solutions. Jepson understands the subject very, very well and swoops around the material with joyous abandon (one example from the table of contents: ""The Banshee Screams for Database Meat""). The book includes source to tinySQL in Java and describes the gory details of creating a JDBC driver and accessing it from Java.The source is available online and Jepson makes himself available by email. Reading the book is very much like having a conversation, distractions , intellectual toys and all, with a brilliant programmer. He knows his stuff; but will you suffer through examples featuring Rita, Maxwell Edison and Mr. Kite just because Mr. Jepson is listening to the Beatles as he writes? That's the only reason this excellent book is not a 10 IMHO."
2,Why I have to know about your taste?,"When I read technics books, I wait read technics books. Why I have to know if you like The Who or The Beatles? (page X, ...every chapter). Difficult language, difficult read, ""personnal affaires""(absinthe), and I losed a lot of time. Less personality and more congruence."
5,Halliwell's Film and Video Giude,"It's the greatest reference book for any film lover I have ever seen and bought it many times. Although it would even be more useful, if it would be available on CD-ROM (in a format readable by Apple Mac and Windows alike) with a search engine to access information like all movies from a certain director etc."
3,Catty Critiques,"This guide is quite thorough, but there's a general tone of contempt for almost all the movies listed. This is the guide for people who love movies written by people who hate them."
5,Great pencils,My daughter loves everything about these pencils and would recommend them for serious drawing. They were a great value on-line!
4,The Stardust Lounge,"Althought Deborah Digges died in 2009, this bookabout her struggles with her young son to overcome hisemotional problems, is a courageous example of motherlylove, to the point of over the top! The results aregood. The sorrow, reflecting on Digges' wonderful mindand poetic talents, is that she herself was unableto go over the top for herself! An amazing story!"
5,A Life Saver,"This book saved my life. I have a very troubled teen and I have been at my wit's end trying to reach him. THE STARDUST LOUNGE is a book that has allowed me to laugh and cry, to back off from my son, and evaluate our situation anew. I am hoping that he will read it too! Thanks to Deborah and Stephen Digges for sharing their story."
2,.....and where is the rest of the story?,"This book is interesting from a philosophical vantage point. However, it is alarming and disturbing. No parent of an adolescent can hope to glean any meaningful direction from this book. Ms. Digges philosophically 'interprets' her son's antisocial acting out, excuses (yes I mean excuses) his violence, gun-toting gang persona and never deals with consequences in any rational way. If he did turn out as well as she says (which I doubt) it is not because of her non-intervention or 'fairness'. I hope no innocents were killed along the way. This book is fantasy and chance, as unworldly as a Las Vegas show."
5,So entertaining he doesn't know he's learning,"We checked this book out at the library and my 3-1/2 year old loves this book almost as much as I do. It is a wonderful text that teaches how the sun moves across the sky, how shadows change, and how the earth orbits the sun. Well written with cute little conversation bits for fun. This is a bit longer than most of our bedtime stories but holds his interest and peaks his curiosity. The back of the book has instructions for making a sundial as well as other hands-on learning ideas.This book would be great for a classroom as well."
3,Transitional Schulze,"Dune is a schizophrenic Schulze album, with the first piece being a dark, violent, and beautiful cello and synth piece, and the second being a bizarre composition in which a monologue read by Arthur Brown is spoken over a flat and uninteresting drum beat. It seems to represent the transition for Schulze from the ambient and beautiful 70's to the cheesy drum-machine and sequencer driven 80's. The first piece is certianly worth the money, but first-time Schulze fans should check out Moondawn, Mirage, and X before getting this half-good, half-bad album."
4,Light but active,"The 1970's touch is still present, the last track with the poem recited by Arthur Brown and Klaus trademark sequencers save the cd from destruction. This is like wine it needs a lot of tasting or in this case-listening to finally get into your system."
3,Love this DVD,The Little Einsteins have always been a favorite with my grandchildren. The episodes are both educational as well as entertaining.
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my nephew who LOVES little Einsteins, and I was very diappointed to hear that the second cartoon out of three on this disc had no sound."
3,Somewhat educational but VERY odd!!,"The child I babysat and lived with for awhile seemed to enjoy this, but I think he much prefers Blue's Clues and especially Saved by the Bell any day. Yes, this is semi-educational, but it is VERY odd. It is not something I would have purchased had I known. It does touch on composers and artists, but there is also a ""mommy"" cello trying to find one of her lost cello children, etc. And there is a skit on socks or something. Very odd."
5,I couldn't put it down...,"What do you do when you've just moved to a new school and a new job and your 6-month old baby is diagnosed with leukemia? What do you do when the operation costs $205,000 and the insurance company won't pay for it? This is the story of the Leelands, a Christian family who goes through a nightmare, and of the junior high school and community that reaches out to them to save the life of one small sparrow.I was reviewing this book while creating a library for our middle school. It caught my attention immediately, as one of my former students has leukemia. As I read it, I began to understand the terrible struggle that my student and his family were going through. And I was touched by the honest description of the Leeland's ups and downs, by the sacrifices made by the kids in Kamiaken Junior High, and by the faith the Leelands showed in a God who sustained them as they went though this tragedy."
2,Eyelets break easily,"My boys really liked the boots, they seem comfortable & sturdy. Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily. On one of the pair, the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it. On the other, it lasted maybe a dozen wears. Hoping Timberland comes through, b/c too late to return to Amazon."
3,not bad,"As a relative beginner, I find it a little verbose, I'd prefer more of a how-to book. But this book gives a good overview of several switches, and there is a lot of useful information. A good book to have on your shelf."
1,Need different text for new Switching exam,"Although if you like manual type books, this is a fine book, it doesn't cut to the point and give you what is needs for the new CCNP Switching exam. Hard to read, with typos make it not a good choice."
5,Goodbye XM,"Sound is super. XM and all the subscription sources are expensive for this day and age of subscription fees. I don't mind listening to a few commercials when the quality is there, and it's FREE!"
1,Limited reception,"I realized when I ordered this HD Jump that I lived in an outlying suburban area of Mpls,MN. I knew it was a gamble on reception. I can actually pick up the public radio broadcast I was after. The problem is that the HD Jump ADVERSELY affected my normal FM reception so badly that I pulled it all back out. I would not recommend this product. Try something with HD built into the radio itself."
5,Have had this a year so far.,"I love this little unit, I have had it a year so far and it is still kicking strong. It is mounted on a suction cup to my windshield and has not given me an ounce of trouble. Great little hd unit and was pretty cheap too."
3,offer a little diffrent experience,"I like the Idea of more free radio and did not want to buy XM or Sirus so for the money I thought I would give it try, I have a few HD stations around me and they do sound better FM stations I frind my self looking aqround the cab of my truck for a sound I never heard before then realize it was on the radio I just never heard it before, AM simply HD stations sound as good or better than any fm station I wish more HD stations carried more sporting events. the difference between fm and fm HD yes you can tell it the difference between AM and AM HD terrific...the content on both am/fm is better than regular radio because there are few commercials and not a lot of snarky DJ's, now the down side the equipment is not that great the receiver gets hot, it wont keep the presets after you turn it off if they would improve those things I garantee the XM/Sirus would be hurting or at least provide better service for less money than they do now."
1,Junk,"Mine was dead out of the box. Hey America, you get what you pay for - there is no free lunch. On its' way back, needless to say."
1,Just awful,"It might just be the area I live in (Austin, TX), but I only got 1 HD station. It was too bulky and looked terrible in my vehicle. I guess I got what I paid for."
2,1918 DVD,"I purchased this DVD, thinking it may have much info regarding the 1918 flu pandemic. It doesn't - just briefly alluded to. But, an interesting glimpse into this very interesting era."
2,Ripped Off,"i just finished 70-98 and passed with 74%, no thanks to this book. though padded out with lots of white space, this book is pretty brief if you actually count the questions. i found at least 4 inconsistencies within the book itself (ie. in one place it says MS Backup will restore DOS backups, 2 pages later it says it wont), several obvious typos, and about 10 more inconsistencies vs. the other book i used (Sam's Teach Yourself). all in all... not that useful, and way overpriced. i am, by the way, a big fan of MS Press in general -- just didnt like this particular book. save your money. ps: study tip ... if you havent done 70-059 yet, make sure you know your TCP/IP stuff, gateways, WINS, etc."
4,"It got me a ""854""","After working in the support field for a couple of years and having my Win95 MCP, I thought Win98 would be a piece of cake. Boy, I was proved wrong after taking 2 practice tests. This was my only resource, other then experience and practice tests. I learned a lot! The book is not perfect, I did find some mistakes, but have never read a Tech manual without any.Overall, buy this even if you think you know Win98. You will be glad you did."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"Do not buy this book.. I repeat do not buy this book. It is a hugh waste of time and money. I used this book and I memorized the questions in it. You will not find any of them on the real test. The real test is very, very hard and this book will not make it any easier for you. I got a very low score on the exam thanks to this book. I Im a straight A student I failed it. Be careful and study till you can't study anymore."
3,"Great movie, but the DVD presentation falls short...","Konnichiwa. Upon watching this film, I was exited to see one of Gojira's films on DVD. I just recently got into DVDs, so I expected to see crystal clear imagery, explosions of sounds, and several special extras. Unfortunatly, I was a little disappointed. There were extras, but the only options were to change the sound quality from mono to surround sound, and a sneak peak at the new Destroy All Monsters Melee game. The quality of the DVD was poor; it was fuzzy, dirty, and pan-and-scanned. However, it's still a great classic and one of Gojira's greatest movies (IMO ^_^). This is overall is a fun lil DVD, but if extras are your thing (they're mine, too), check out the Terror Of Mechagodzilla DVD from Simitar. Happy Gojira DVD hunting, and sayonara!"
4,monster bash,"aliens rebuild mechagodzilla and send him to battle godzilla again. fighting along side him is titanasauros. this one is much better than the previous film, good but sometimes akward battle scenes. also, good scenes of destruction as well. after defeating the enemys godzilla is seen swiming away in the end. getting a long rest before returning in godzilla 1985."
2,Robot Godzilla makes a not so glorious return.,"Summary: Godzilla alone must fight to save Earth from Mechagodzilla, Titanosaurus, and an alien plot to invade earth.The last and almost least film in the original 15 movie Godzilla series. Boring story line and not so spectacular monster battles help bog down what could've been a good follow up to ""Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla"".Next is ""Godzilla 1985"", the first of 7 films comprising the second or ""heisei"" godzilla series."
3,The return of Ishiro Honda.,"After a long hiatus, Ishiro Honda and Akira Ifukube return to close the 1st G series. Honda brings a welcome level of seriousness and gravity to the proceedings. However, spfx director Nakano is no Eiji Tsubaraya. The result is a decent film that could have been much better. Mechgodzilla, so powerful in the previous film, is reduced to playing second banana to the rather silly Titanosaurus. The plot has some pretty deep holes, especially when considering the loose continuity between this and the original MG. Godzilla is still stuck in his ""hero"" mode but is not too annoyingly cute this time. Ifukube's music brings the film series full circle and adds a considerable amount of emotional heft to the picture. The final battle is pretty spectacular, though marred by a few sub-par effects. Though not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, Terror of MG is a good entry in the G saga."
2,American version doesn't compare,"This easily my top three favorite Godzilla movies, but this DVD release unfortunately has tons of scenes cut out (probably 20 min or more). One major cut is the ending when Katsura gets shot, she is supposed to kill herself but then the movie just ends leaving you wondering what happened. I guess there was just too much suicide in this movie or something. If you are buying this movie for Godzilla fight scenes it is well worth it, but I wouldn't recommended it to someone who remembers the original film, I'd wait for the release of the unedited classic that I would have given 5 stars for instead of only 2."
2,For fans only,"Aliens from the Third Planet of the Black Hole (or something like that) hatch a plot to transform Tokyo into some kind of alien super-city with the aid of a giant robot and a living dinosaur. Naturally, only Godzilla can save the day. I loved these movies when I was a kid and I still want to love them now for their nostalgia value, but I just can't get past how clunky, repetitive, and, well...dull they are. Nevertheless, I give this film a couple stars because I can still get a thrill from the iconic image of Godzilla stomping through Tokyo, the classic score is great, and there are a few moments of goofy charm that deliver the experience I was hoping for./"
3,How NOT to edit a fairly good Godzilla film!,"By the way, for me, it's 3 stars for the film, minus several million for the editing!Well, wouldn't you know it, Toho pulled the plug on Godzilla in 1975 just as the films were getting better! Darnnit! The basic premise behind this movie is that the spacemen from the previous film have recreated Mechagodzilla and have placed the controls into a woman/cyborg that one of the heroes is in love with. Add a fish monster named Titanosaurus and Godzilla to the mix and you've got a three way dance of death that unfourtunately, again, is weighed down by the obtrusive editing job done for TV!Reccomended."
5,Mechagodzilla returns,"This is the explosive sequel to godzilla versus Mechagodzilla. A few years have past since godzila and King Sesar defeated Mechagodzilla. The evil Simmons have return and rebuilt mech Godzilla. They have team ed up with a mad Dr. MFoney who has mangaged to control Titanosaurus.A giant power dinosaur who somehow survivved when the metor struck earth. Together with Mechagodzilla the unlesh atrail of destruction on Tokeyo. Godzilla must do battle against his cyber counter Part.Mechagodzilla weapons have been upgraded he nowe has revolving missle. He is controlled by Myfuna cyborg daughther. If you like this I recomend Godzilla Versus Mechgodzila, Godzilla versus Mecha godzila 2 and Godzilla against Mechagodzilla"
4,Mecha G is Back!!!,Get ready Mechagodzilla is back again to finish off godzilla but this time he brought Titanasoarous a dinosoaur found by a scientist but the aliens from the planet catpure them and use his daughter to control Titana S. to help mechagodzilla defeat his enemy.Overal the monster action is very good an di mean Godzilla taking on two strong opponents.Really a must have godzilla flick.
4,The Chosen: Subtle and Likeable,"When I was reading through this book, because I found it on the back to school shelf at the bookstore, I told my roommate it was enjoyable and informative, but that i didn't see how it could be a classic because it had no climax and was going nowhere fast. Well, then, towards the very end and with very subtle fingers, the climax touched me and I cried.This was a subtle, enjoyable book and I'm happy I read it."
5,Chaim's Chosen Catches 1st Rank Slot,"Chaim Potok's epic tale is of two boys who struggle through their years of friendship, threatened by their different branches of Judaism. Both boys' fathers play important roles in their communities, even the world. But the emphasized importance they had on their childrens lives and each others is astronomical. Little things can be of great importance, true, but this point is accentuated almost too often, and too much, for that matter. Some points tend to hang on things for excessively long times.Despite this, the story was sensational. Great for all ages, it throws different elements in the mixture- a little history here, dash of fiction there.... This tends to spruce up the story and pick up the slower, more uneventful points, making the read much more enjoyable. I have no doubts that 'The Chosen' is one of, if not THE most phenomenal books of its time."
4,Fantastic!,"I LOVE this book! I thought about it for weeks after I first read it. This is most definitely worth a read. I learned a lot about Jewish culture that I had never known before and about people in general. I must admit that the book started getting a bit boring when they went into depth about certain things, mainly because sometimes the author went on for pages...but other than that, the book was very, very good."
2,It did not keep me on the edge of my seat.,"The chosen was very boring and uneventful. It was this happens, then something else happens, then over and over again. The story of the friendship between Reuven and Danny is told well, but besides that, it was horrible."
2,"This Book was a slow-moving, rather boring story.","This book was a required reading for my school, the book was too slow, and repetative at some points. It took to long to get from conflict to climax, to much beating around the bush."
3,The Chosen By Chaim Potok,"If you manage to wade your way through the unbelieveably deep themes that lies in this overwhelmingly meaningful book, then you will find that you have enjoyed a great piece of literature and learned countless moral lessons. But be prepared to read paragraphs twice and thrice and also to THINK. Do not pick up if you are looking for an easy read, but if you're one of those people who could find meaning in a cheeseburger, you'll love it."
3,A Fair Quality Book,"The book had a different subject than from what am used to. I had to read it for 8th grade English and about quarter of the class enjoyed it. It was very into the Jewish religion, however, many people didn't know much about it and found it sometimes difficult to understand. The main subject seemed to be the physical silences between charcters that occurred throughout the novel. Many different silences occur through different events in the plot, as different family views get in the way of a friendship. It was a novel that was a bit difficult to understand, and not the best plot I have ever read."
3,Kind of a smelly book,"This former library book is kind of smelly. I could not place it with my other books in case of mold, so it is sitting in the freezer. After a week or 2 I will see if I can read it. Sometimes this works, sometimes the moldy books will make me itch. I checked it after a couple days and have hopes for a good outcome."
1,The book didn't do much for me,"The chosen is written by chaim potok. I didn't like the book because it seemed a little unrealistic . I couldn't really relate to the book , because i'm not familiar with Jewish culture and I don't know any Jewish terms. I myself like action books and don't care for any boring Jewish books. there are facts that show that Hasidic people do not get along with other cultures they keep to themselves. So why would Danny try to be friendly with rueven. I don't think any parent would act like that to his child, and the child would be okay with it. I would of like the book if it was a little more exciting. I suggest this book to anybody Jewish or who is interested in Jewish culture."
1,Awfully boring,"All that happens is that the main character gets hit by a baseball in the first few pages. After that, nothing happens."
4,The Vision of the Chosen,"The Chosen is either loved or hated by those who read it. In my English class, we read this book, and I really was the only one who had a neutral stance on it. The story is about two young Jewish adolescents from very different backgrounds living in Brooklyn with their two fathers. I suppose I shall list PROS and CONS I have found with this book.PROS: Very insightful about relationships, discrimination, the power of religion, and different branches of Judaism. Characters you can sympathize with.CONS: Slow moving and tedious to the less keen reader, and some of the characters are too easy to dislike (until you get to know them and their motives a little better).Well, I think this was a good enough book. Go out to your local library and give and give it a chance!"
4,Excellent Book!,"Although i read this book for a class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book hooks in the reader by opening out with a tension-filled baseball game. Needless to say, this book is a real page-turner. Furthermore, the book was a very enriching read. The often overlooked customs, history and varying religions of the Jewish religion is covered in a way that doens't put the reader to sleep. The tale itself is also very well-developed, as it shows the clashing between two Jewish realms.The only downfall of the book in my mind, were the unrealistic qualities of a few of the characters. It seemed as though they were too smart for being just teenagers at time, and many of their discussions seemed unrealistic.This however, didn't detract too much from the read, and I'd recommend this to any adult-level reader. Once again; it's a page turner (took me only about 3 days) and well worht the read."
3,The Chosen,"The concept of this book is good. The author tends to drag on in the middle of the book, making the separation between friends long and boring. He could have eliminated a good portion and made the book a better read. I could not see why Reuven did not make new friends, but continued to pine for Danny as if he were a girl. That part of the book seemed unrealistic."
2,Fulfillment and Disapointment,"After spending part of my summer vaction reading Chaim Potok's novel The Chosen, I felt that I learned more about the Jewish religion, but I was also a little disappointed. The Chosen is a novel of two Jewish boys growing up under different Jewish customs in the 1940's. Reuven Malter, the main character in the book is an Orthodox Jew, and Danny Saunders, the other boy is Hasidic. Since the two are different in religious ways, Danny being more serious about his beliefs, and Reuven being more relaxed, there is a lot of tension between the two at first, but they get around that and evolve to become best friends. I felt disappointed after reading this because I expected much more. It has wonderful reviews, so I expected non-stop excitement. At times the book was fun to read and interesting, but most of the time it was rather monotonous.I give this book two of five stars."
3,A story for all,"This book is an ok read. I was assigned this book for my english class. The beginning is easy to get into but there are slow parts throughout the book. Potok goes into great detail in describing the characters and their emotions. I could see each character vividly in my mind as though they were real, and as I read I felt every emotion that they felt. Potok's descriptions were so clear that the world around me became the world of Reuven Malter and his friend Danny Saunders. In the story I saw how two jewish boys, each raised differently, became friends, overcame their families differences, and grew to become confident, intelligent young men. Reading The Chosen taught me a lot about the Jewish religion and what it must have been like to be a jew in 1940's USA. It also taught me about life. I learned that anything can happen, and that true friends are hard to come by and should ba cherished always. This book is a atory for everyone."
3,The Choice of The Chosen,"This book doesn't do anything for me. The Chosen, by the late Chaim Potok is very misleading to me. From what I get, it is about a Jewish teenager who learns how to grow up in a Jewish culture. The first time I read this (and believe it, I've read this many times!) I couldn't get it. I was all uh...err... and just couldn't make sense of it. So I started over, and over, and over. But if you, however, are used to more advanced novels, read this. From what I did get, this book was quite intriguing. So take it from me, this is a great book about cultural diversity. Or don't, depending all on how you look at it."
1,Pity Party,"I hated this book when I had to read it for school, but it did help me understand when my best friend's parents wouldn't allow me in their house because I wasn't Jewish. I was only allowed in the garage, and my best friend had to fight to allow that much access. I can't imagine what it was like for blacks...segregation sucks."
2,In a Different Light,"The book was very inspiring and motivational. It was very hard to read. It took a very long time to get into the book. I almost gave up reading it but I had to see why other reviews that I read spoke so highly of it. Once I finished the book I realize why. It was about true friendship and how it can last through anything. It was also about a young man and his thirst for knowledge, and the lengths he had to go to to reach his final happiness. It inspired to to follow my dreams, and decide my future for myself."
2,It was ok....i wouldnt read it on my own time thats for sure,it was ok....if you dont have to read it for school then DONT READ itother than that it was ok :)
2,Not bad....,"This book is ok...it teaches important life lessons, but the whole book is a waste of time and too long to read. I found it to be very very boring and didnt want to finish but i had to for a school report"
1,This Book is Terrible,"For your convinience, I will now boil down The Chosen into one easily readable paragraph:""I can hear silence,"" Danny said sadly. I went over and gave him a big hug. After that we went for a long walk. We walked for about two hours. We walked at a medium pace. While we walked, we talked about the Torah. Danny does four blat of the Torah a day! Danny's so smart, I can only do two blat. After that we went to Danny's house and argued with his dad. We argued about the Torah. Then I went home and cried.Now imagine if this paragraph was two hundred pages long. That is pretty much all The Chosen is."
4,this book can teach you a lot...,"To me this book is about the importance of understanding different positions. It is about the importance of interaction and not reaction to problems. It shows how two boys who are very different and start their relationship hating each other, turned into kids that were best friends. It taught me a lot about understanding and finding a middle ground. It's funny, although the book is about two Jewish boys, it seemed almost Buddhist in nature.... Anyway, read this book."
4,"ALright, but inaccurate",Overall a very good book. But there is no Hasidic sect that has a tradition of silence.
3,Two boys coming together with many differences.,"Two Jewish boys living within 5 blocks from each other have never met each other until their respective teams play each other in baseball. Reuven and Danny play on opposite teams with different forms of the Jewish religion. Danny hits a ball back at Reuven (who is pitching)and sends him to the hospital. During this game, the two boys exchange words etc to show their dislikes for each other. Reuven gets put into the hospital because of his eye getting hit by the baseball. Danny comes to visit him and to apologize. The two boys discover many common things about each other and become good friends. The rest is held withing the book!"
3,The Chosen is overrated,The Chosen is ok for a general book. But as a classic it is not that good. It was a deptessing tale about two people that could not be friends because of religous differences. What religion in this age? nothing any more decremination will be almost completely terminated in 100 years so Chaim took people's time to read about a unrealistic plot and it has become a classic! I could write about me and my friend's father that had some differences so then we can't be friends.For a plot this stupid it was an excellent book but the plot was to radical.
5,Great book.,Chaim Potok is an amazing author. His discription of Jewish society makes the reader feel almost Jewish. This story of a friendship built from conflict is a must read for anyone. Never boring.
3,Worth reading - insightful,"I really liked the historical aspect of the book. Though a work of fiction, it helped me to understand many ideas among the Jewish followers. A little too slow at times for my tastes (particularly the Talmud discussions). A certain amount was necessary to comprehend the background and situation but it went a bit overboard for me.Overall I thought this was worth the time invested in reading it and I feel like a gained new insight into the Jewish faith and relationships in general."
5,Better with re-reading,"I first read this book as a teenager, and have re-read it numerous times since. I'm now in my mid-40's. As a teen, it opened my eyes to a world most of us never encounter - Jewish Brooklyn, the sphere of the Hasids, Talmudic study. As I've aged my enjoyment of the book has matured. These days, it's particularly interesting in light of Mid East politics and the controversy surrounding the founding of the State of Israel. Through all these years, though, the relationships between the boys and their fathers remains as touching, as profound as they were upon first reading. I cried the first few times I read this book. I still re-read certain passages just for the emotional ""oomph"".A tremendous, powerful book that bears up well for a lifetime's enjoyment."
4,An interesting insight into a different culture,"I'm not Jewish but my co-worker who is Jewish recommended this book to me. I found it to be very engaging from beginning to end. This is a coming of age story of two teen-age boys who form an unlikely friendship set against the backdrop of the end of WW II.The reviewers who called it boring apparently don't understand that good storytelling doesn't have to be all about slam-bang action. It's lamentable that popular culture has become so action-oriented that so many cannot appreciate a quiet, well-told story such as this one.This book reminded me of ""A Separate Peace"", another novel that is often assigned for school reading. If you like the one, you will probably like the other and sadly, if your taste runs only to action and adventure you may not ""get"" either one."
5,"sight, silence, and soul","Chaim Potok's The Chosen is the powerful story of two Orthodox Jewish boys and the friendship that unites them in the face of all kinds of opposition.Reuven Malter is fifteen years old when he meets Danny Saunders, the son of a Hasidic tzaddik. As Danny and Reuven become friends, Reuven learns that Danny is not the average Hasid. For one, he has a brilliant mind such as only appears once in a generation. He also has deep struggles with his culture and his family, which Reuven often cannot understand.The novel follows Danny and Reuven through high school and college, where they both struggle with their beliefs, their families, and their friendship.The Chosen is both challenging and uncomfortable to read, for the questions that it raises are ones that cut to the heart. What is a soul, and what price is worth paying for one?Beautifully written, compelling, and challenging, this book is highly recommended."
3,Could go either way.,"You might like this book or you might hate it. I found it somewhat dull but if it's your taste, you'll like it."
3,slight damage,"my book came today, and it looked perfect EXCEPT the top right corner had signs of wear and possible usage. Along the whole top on the back half, it's black and some of the pages are worn down like maybe it touched a sander for a second. Overall great book great shipping, just slight damage!"
2,I found The Chosen to be a very confusing and difficult.,"The Chosen by Chaim Potok is about two boys, Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders, who meet at a baseball game, when Danny accidentally hits Reuven in the eye with a baseball, and Danny and Reuven become instant friends.While they are friendly, they have some problems. I thought that the book was a good portrayal of how good friends should always stick together, but I found that the author, Chaim Potok is confusing at times. He used Hasidic and Hebrew words that the reader if not Jewish might have difficultly understanding.The book was good for someone Jewish; otherwise, it was a flop."
1,WOW- This is a REALLY GREAT BOOK---LOL,"Oh- wow- a softball game. It is just amazing the way chaim potok can make something such as softball turn into death and gore.This is sooooooo exiting!!!Its almost as god as resident evil,only it is really boring and a waste of treesif i wanted to read about jews, i would read the bible, and if i wanted to read about softball i would read some biography...even that is more fun than this bookdo not waste money OR trees unless you must get this for school. it is BADby the way, im 14 not 12, i just didnt feel like getting an accounthave a nice day(unless you are willingly reading this in which case: may your bookshelf catch on fire)would anyone like to buy this from me?"
3,A novel about the relationships between fathers and sons.,"The book, The chosen by Chaim Potok was a great novel telling about the lives of two different jewish boys. This book was fairly intesting because it told of the lives of two boys who have different religous beliefs. They live their lives happily as friends, not caring what anyone has to say about them. In a small part of the city of Brooklyn, New York, there are many types of jewish people. The book described what it was like to be a jewish boy in the big city. Chaim Potok titled it The Chosen because these two boys were the ones chosen to represent their jewish communities. The book told a lot of things that most people would not know about the jewish religion. The Chosen is a good teenagers book and might be a good novel for a family memberto read. I reccomend this for many people to read it is a great novel."
5,Excellence.,"This book was a wonderful read. Very good indeed. I expected that the book would be very deep and meaningful, but I didn't expect it to come across so well.One thing that is minorly surprising is C. Potok never really talks about Reuven's (the main character) faith.All in all this book has earned it's place among the great classics."
3,This was an interesting book,"The positive outcome from reading The Chosen is that I learned about Hasidic Jews. I never knew much about these very unusual people , but after reading, I have come to understand them. In fact some of the issues they deal with, are common to many teenagers. This novel is mainly meant for adults. Most kids or teenagers who read this inn my class got bored and weren't able to understand most of the book. I recommend this book to a more mature reading audience."
3,This book was very educational and good,"The book The Chosen By Chaim Potok, is an educational and touching story about two jewish teenage boys and thier frinedship. One of the boys, Danny Saunders is a Hasidic Jew and Reueven Malter is a orthodox Jew. They both live different lifestyles, and it was only by chance that they became frineds. While reading this book I learned what two different Jewish cultures were like. I highly recomend this book. It was a good read and a well written story."
3,Enligtening Yet Boring,"The Chosen is an enlightening book about Jewish culture in America. Because of reading this book I have a better understanding of what it is like to be a Hisadic and Orthedox Jew living in America. The book itself was very hard to get into. The first thirty pages of lthue book is a baseball game that moves slowly. Much of the book presents huge details about Jewish culture and history. These sections tend to get boring. Even though they are extremely educational, the reader tends to dirft off about half way through these. A couple of times I almost fell asleep. When the reader returns to the plot, the reader tends to lose interest. The story itself could also move along a little more quickly. The tempo of the story did not seem to flow either. One minute Reuven and Danny are talking about something and then another, the book discusses Jewish History. I would highly recomend this book to someone interested in Jewish Culture and religion."
3,This book was very educational and good,"The book The Chosen By Chaim Potok, is an educational and touching story about two jewish teenage boys and thier frinedship. One of the boys, Danny Saunders is a Hasidic Jew and Malter is a orthodox Jew. They both live different lifestyles, and it was only by chance that they became frineds. While reading this book I learned what two different Jewish cultures were like. I highly recomend this book. It was a good read adn a well written story."
3,The Chosen is a fascinating story,The Chosen is a fascinating book about two boys and their friendship. Reuven Malter an orthodox jew and Danny Saunders the other boy is a hassidic jew. These two boys develope a relationship through a baseball game where reuven is hit in the eye with a baseball and is hospitalized. The boys learn some things that shock them about eachothers fathers.Reuven learns Dann's father is bringing him up in silence which means he won't talk to him unless studying Talmud. I give this book three stars and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the jewish religion. This book reveals much about hassidic jewish life.
5,good book,"Eli Manna 10/19/98 The Chosen Revue PaperThe Chosen is a book about two boys who become best friends and stick together through the worst of times. Danny Suanders, one of the boys, is a Hasidic Jew. He is very religious and has to follow the family tradition of becoming a Rabbi. The other boy, Reuven Malter, is an Orthodox Jew who is not as religious as Danny. However they still are occasion best friends. I thought this is a very good book over all. Even though this book drags on a little it is still is educational and helpful if you want to learn more about the Jewish religion."
3,"it was okay, confusing at times...","This book was pretty good. I thought the beginning was the best part of the whole story. I am not Jewish, so I did not understand all the terminology. I think Jewish people would be able to understand and connect better to it. But it did send out good messages and themes. Although at many points I found myself forcing myself to go back to reading it, I was assigned to read it for Honors English. It was boring at some parts, to the point where once or twice I awoke to find that I had fallen asleep while reading it. But other parts are very interesting, like the beginning, for example."
5,I'm a sucker for father-son relationship stories...,"I have my book club to thank for this one. I'd never heard of it, or even the author, before. Of course, starting with the two main characters playing baseball together was sure to make me love the book from the start.What I loved so much about the story was the reflections it gave me on friendship and being a father to my son. I just hope I can have the kind of communication with my son that Reuven's dad has with him. It is also a beautiful reminder to be circumspect in one's judgement of others."
3,Slow start but good ending,"It was a slow start but definitely picked up as I progressed. I was intrigued with the contrast of the two religious sects of Judaism. The relationship between the characters was interesting due to the contrast of their personalities, family life and religious rites. I would suggest this as a read...."
3,A wonderful story about two boys,""" The Chosen"" is a delightful book about two jewish boys. Reuven Malter is a Orthodox Jew and Danny Saunders is a Hasidic Jew. The two boys meet while playing a game of baseball, Danny hits Reuven in the head with the baseball. When Danny comes to visit Reuven at the hospital, they become closed friends. Even though their religion beliefs are so different. The Hasidic Jew is more extreme than the Orthodox Jew. While the two boys attending Hirsch College, Reuven's father make a Zionist speech in Madison Square Garden about how Jews should build their capital in Palestine. Danny's father find out about the speech and forbids Danny from seeing Reuven. Reb Saunders is anti-Zionist. While the relationship suffers, Reuven's father has a heart attack. Danny, the son of a Tzaddik, an Othodox Rabbi, must make a choice that can effect him for the rest of his natural life."
3,The Chosen,"This novel was one of those iffy books. Its theme was really interesting and true to life. The characters' development were intriguing in that you could see how they reached what they were to become. However, I didn't like this book. The theme was very good, but it was something that was already known to me. It didn't have that much an impact on me. But people who don't understand life in the way that is shown in the book would find it very interesting. I would recommend this book to anybody. This book is worth a try. I did not like it all that much, but other people will find it very interesting through its theme and the way the author tried to reach his theme."
2,For Mature Or Searching Audiences Only,"I picked up the Chosen because it was assigned to my son for his summer reading program, for fifteen-year-olds. The first chapter describing a heated baseball game had potential for capturing a young readers attention. However, the terminology, the in-depth history, the passive conflict, and the lack of action soon gave way to tedium. Yes, it contrasts Jewish sects and compares relationships with fathers, but to get to that point is almost as mind numbing as a marathon Talmud lesson! Lets challenge and inspire, not overwhelm and bore our students."
2,New York Rocker Not So Rockin',"Actually I'd probably give it 2 and a half stars. I did finish it. But inbetween I read a true crime murder story. I found the style of writing a bit elementary and hard follow. Especially the first 2 years with Blondie. Lots of blank spaces in this book, so maybe it really does live up to the title."
2,No sympathy for the devil,"It would be almost impossible to have lived through the time period and cultural place that Valentine did and not have a few interesting stories to tell. Unfortunately he reveals himself as a not very likable character. He credits himself with Blondie's success - although he only played on their first album. Nasty jabs at the other members of Blondie, as well as complete disregard for a former girlfriend and sick child, make for very unpleasant reading at times - vitriol and envy seem to be the driving force behind his writing. Still, it's a least a better book thanTurn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius, which is a completly embarassing, amateur mess. Not sure how it's possible to make such fascinating subjects boring and repetitive, but Valentine manages to do it. 'New York Rocker' is certainly interesting, but it leaves a bitter taste."
4,Gary's Valentines,"I got this book the other day here on Amazon and I couldn't put it down. Especially during his years with Blondie which were from my point of view the most interesting stories in this book. He has a lot of crazy, funny, scary, and sad stories to tell in this book and they are very entertaining and gripping to read. I couldn't put it down. I had to know more. I love his insight into the whole scene from that period. He links the glitter period to the punk period and back again very well.Read this book."
3,"Great Concept, So-so Execution","Great idea - saves space while being right where you need it, when you need it.However, the execution they used when creating this item is average at best. The plastics and movement of the arm feel cheap and it has a design flaw: one of the two screws for bolting it to the wall is towards the top, under the arm that pivots out. Try getting a screwdriver in THERE to tighten it down!I was never able to get it tightened all the way down, so I have a feeling I will be dealing with mounting issues again in a year or two. We'll see."
3,Handy but with some issues,Purchased this item recently and it's a great product for the laundry room. However I did have an issue with the bar that came with it. Mounting was somewhat easy but when you install the clothe bar you have to remove the bracket. You should be able to disconnect the bar without removing the whole bracket. The bar should have an open hook of some sort instead of a whole. You can't close the brackets with the bar connected when not in use.
4,Arrow Hanger,"Works Great, Its not super strong but it works.Its a place to hang stuff right out the washer or dryer."
4,InstaHanger review - Works pretty well,This InstaHanger works pretty well. I have it mounted into the studs in the wall for added support. I'm not sure how it would work in drywall or other wall types.It also looks ok and is easy to install.nic
3,Instahanger Review,While the functionality is great the length of the hanger is somewhat short. Great for hanging clothes straight from the dryer but space is limited for hanging wet items. Overall a good product.
1,Missing parts,"The picture/description shows it coming with a bracket to hang over the door, but it does not come with it! I sent the first order back and asked for a replacement and it also came without the bracket. I just ended up sending it back."
5,Laundry room,I often wash and iron work shirts and end up hanging them up on my door jam. Now I can dry them over night and them iron them. Perfect for the laundry room or small space.
4,Clothes Wall Hanger,"Product works fine is, if attached correctly, is strong enough for shirts and pants. This unit is large and when opened takes up a triangle of space. There are more compact wall hangers for less money, so you might want to shop around."
5,insta hanger,Love love love my insta hanger dos't take up a lot of space but always there and handy. Easy to orderand a good price as well. Bought one for my sister too.
5,Great product for a low price,"I'm a government contractor stationed in Afghanistan and I needed a place to hang my clothes in my room. I have to say, that this worked out a lot better than what I thought. The price is very reasonable as well."
5,PERFECT,"We have a small laundry room with no place to hang clothes as we take them out of the dryer. The instahanger changes all that because we can pop it open when we need it and then close it down when not in use. I liked it so much I bought a couple more (one to hang where I do the ironing, and another for upstairs where I can hang my kids' clothing for them to retrieve).But wait! There's more...They even make a version that hangs over the back of a door, which is fantastic. I can move it to a different place in the house in case I need it somewhere temporarily for some reason. Or, suppose I attend a function where I need to change into a tux or suit, what a brilliant way to ensure I don't have to drape my suit over the back of a chair. I just pop this little guy into the bottom of my garment bag and if I need it, I've got it."
5,best idea,"Just wanted to say that my grandaughter is so taken with anything that Elmo does that at 18m she is so brilliant, LOL. she is enamored with Elmo so anytime we get something of his especially dvd's that she can watch, they are very affective. I am so greatful for these DVDs as is her mother!!!! He keeps her very interested in everything."
5,My two-year old loves this!,"My son just turned two and he loves this Elmo DVD. He watched it once and already runs around remarking on things that are opposites. He especially loves the see-saw episode with Mr. Noodle. And, as my son never sleeps in the car, this DVD saved us during a very long car trip."
3,Elmo DVD,"This was a good DVD, but I own a few that are much better. The Best of Elmo and Music Magic are excellent."
3,light on novel medium on lean,"It a lean framework with a bit of novel draped over it. It's a quick easy read, and maybe being fictional makes is an easier read. There were some new presentations of lean concepts that I hadn't seen before, so that was somewhat helpful. Is it a top 5 ""have to read"" Lean reference, No. Is it a pleasant read and can you learn something useful, yes, definitely."
3,Andy & Me: Crisis And Transformation On The Lean Journey,"This is a good book once you get over the similarities to 'The Goal'. Very much of it starts and tracks too much of the same scenario, but this time using the 'Lean' approach. With that aside, it does a good job tracking the emotions, excitement, frustrations, challenges and success of a lean journey in a manufacturing and assembly business. Not many lean tools are really described aside of the root cause and corrective action approach, but it provides a pretty realistic look at what happens inside a larger plant once the journey begins and people engage themselves. Andy and Me is a quick read and good for the novice or someone needing to `whet their whistle' on the lean approach."
5,Kept me interested,"The ""novel"" approach to the Lean Management system is refreshing and the characters kept the story moving and interesting.We were required to read for work but I found it enjoyable reading."
1,Written by an ignoramus for the foolish,"I never write book review but had to in this case.Why I Hate Israel: A Candid Account is the result of what happens when anyone can self-publish a book.Priya Gandhi-Ganesh is obviously a very angry person. The author says she is concerned about human rights. Is she is, perhaps she should investigate the following countries for sever human rights violations:ChinaMost of AfricaSaudi ArabiaSyriaIraqIranEtc...............As to her facts in the book, there are few. Even her historical data is wrong in many places.The publishers of this book do mainly fiction, of which this book is."
1,Any book that begins by promoting hatred of an entire country is crap by definition.,"Hatred of an entire group or country is unconsionable, regardless of who you are or what group you hate.If someone wrote a book called ""Why I Hate India"" or ""Why I Hate Hindus"", it would rightly be decried as the basest of bigoted nonsense--most likely by the author herself. Claiming that ""Gandhi-Ganesh argues from Hinduism, Christianity, International Human Rights, and ethics why her hatred is justified and even encouraged,"" is despicable. Decent Hindus, Christians and those involved in human rights know that none of these beliefs can ever legitimately be used to justify or encourage hatred.This does NOTHING to advance the cause of peace--on the contrary, it can only serve to inflame prejudice.Amazon should be ashamed of selling and promoting such trash."
2,"A good book for young kids, others skip it!","Out of all the books in this not very good series, this was probably one of the worst. Right behind Zorba the Hutt's Revenge and Queen of the Empire of course. As much as I enjoy it when the characters wander around jungle planets,(my favorite) this book had an unbelievable plot, weak diologue, and an extremely childish writing style. And that Ken is a nice boy and all, but a complete geek. An attempt to relate to the ""normal kid"" who would be reading this book. Also the characters from the movies are either grossly exagerated, or practicly nonexistant. All of them are warped and and barely recognizabal as Star Wars characters, most of all Luke. Kids twelve and under, for whom this book is intended for, probably won't mind any of that, though, adult and teenage Star Wars fans, such as myself will probably find them boring and silly."
5,More great adventure,This book has a lot of adventure in it because Luke is in a race against Trioculus in the search for the Lost City. I liked it because Ken knows so much about Star Wars history. I also liked it when the Rebel Alliance started destroying Trioculus's base. There were great new weapons.
1,Ick....,"I rented this movie, and the quality was horrible. I have the Simitar release, and that was way better. Now I have the R2 uncut Japanese version of this movie, and that is far superior than any release here of this version. It was remastered, so there are hardly any scratch marks on the print, which is what it should be when released for dvd. It was worth the price I paid. While the original version wasn't made with a widescreen format, the US release was, and only the Simitar release is widescreen, this isn't. Classic Media should be punished by all us Godzilla fans for this blasphemy!!"
4,Making Sence,"From the first time I saw this movie when I was A young boy,I only saw this movie one way.Now to see it this way,It makes sense."
2,It didn't work.,"The disc wasn't scratched or obviously damaged, but it started skipping about halfway through the movie on several DVD players, including a PC DVD drive. My guess is that the factory pressed a few bad discs and I got one of them. Amazon gave me a full refund so I'm not too disappointed."
5,one of the best godzilla movies ever,This movie was good I liked both this godzilla and it's sequel they should have made the very original godzilla at least 1900 meters tall that would have been awesome and he really would look like the true king of the monsters he would be the biggest and most powerful monster ever. what an awesome movie thumbs up. plus it is much better then the tristar godzilla 1998
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was a Great Godzilla movie. It's scary!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should watch it at night!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Quality of DVD not good,Tried this disc in two different DVD players and there is a point in the movie which will not play.
3,Weak extras,"Good, clean version of the film, but the Commentary Track is annoying because it's too high strung and paced way too fast for my taste. (They needed a director or editor to reel-in the talent.) The other extras are weak, except for THE UNLUCKIEST DRAGON short. No vintage poster gallery either... If you must have GODZILLA on BluRay, wait for the price to come down - you're not missing much."
2,Ramond Burr is a Party Pooper for Godzilla,"This American version of Gojira stinks. The quality is horrible, the audio is horrible and the only special feature is a corney and home-made trailer for the now out-of-date Godzilla: Destroy all Monsters. Ramond Burr ruins the whole movie and who the heck would go on a trip to Egypt from The East coast and stop in Tokyo? You go ove rthe Atlantic Ocean duh! Unfortunetly, as for the time being this is the only DVD of the black and white classic you can get. Simitar had the rights to it but Simitar's now out of business and the DVD costs a heck of a lot more because of supply and demand. I'd wait for the Ratio Pictures DVD release of the original Gojira if they ever do release it."
1,Good movie but..........,"If you pick this up expecting blu-ray quality like I did, save your money. Whoever transfered this to blu-ray did so without ""cleaning up"" the film's imperfections first. It's full of scratches. I had the standard DVD release of this and was disappointed when i put on the blu-ray version and saw all the flaws still in it. They didn't even have the courtesy of English-dubbing it. If you don't understand Japanese, sitting through 2 hours hearing all the screaming in a language unknown, it grates on your last nerve. Why couldn't they English-dub it like Criterion did to Salo? In a nutshell, I think the manufacturers of this blu-ray release are in it purely for the money. The bonus features are pretty decent, including the making of the Godzilla suit, which was interesting but other than that, I'd say don't waste your money. You can get the standard dvd of this at a fraction of the cost with the same quality."
5,finally released after 14 years,Criterion first announced Godzilla on Laserdisc back around 1998. That release never happened and took on somewhat legendary status. But now around 14 years later we finally have Godzilla done to the standards of Criterion. The picture is fine but not perfect. Its difficult to know the reasons for that given we dont know what the state of the materials were that they started with. But its still hands down better than any other previous release.The extras are up to the usual standard as well. The paper booklet was very terse and not all that great. But there was some useful details about certain films contemporary to Godzilla dealing with nuclear weapons in Japan. I liked the design of the packaging and the use of color.This is hardly a great work of art as a film. But its historically interesting in many respects.I just hope we don't have to wait another 14 years for the other five Godzilla films Criterion promised in 1998.
1,Blu-ray version is missing Raymond Burr,"Blu-ray version is missing Raymond Burr!!I have seen both the American and Japanese versions of Godzilla. The Blu-ray version is missing Raymond Burr. I prefer the American version of this movie with Raymond Burr, I understand that others prefer the Japanese version.Postpone your purchase until both versions of the movie are included."
4,Fine but.......When will TOHO smarten up??,"While it's nice to see this US edtion being available, TOHO needs to get their rear-end in gear and get a collector's set on the market.....Why isn't the original Japanese version available with English subtitles in the US? It's in the theaters in selected locations now...so the additional costs would be marginal. But why stop with just the first film....We really need a set of all 24 of the G films with additional materials done right....cleaned up transfers....US and Japanese versions when applicable.....Until they do this I think real fans should boycott the shabby versions. If they have a marketing department worth their yen, they should be well-aware that the demand is there and the time is way past due!!!!!"
5,One of the best old time horror movies,"Have always been a fan of the original horror flicks. This one can't be beat. The technology is amazing, especially being done without computers. Those were real action movies."
2,Blu-Ray not as advertised,"Amazon's description for the Blu-ray edition states, ""Also included is Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1956), the popular 'Americanized' version starring Raymond Burr..."" This is false. The Blu-Ray version does NOT include the Americanized cut. Amazon appears to have lifted this wording from the 2-disc standard DVD set, ""Gojira / Godzilla Deluxe Collector's Edition."" And considering this Blu-ray's poor image quality (described in other reviews), that standard DVD set is clearly a better choice at half the price."
4,Lots of Fun!,"If you enjoy Godzilla movies, and I do, then this is a must have. I have not seen the restored original but I hope to do so soon. What makes this so well done is the cutting and editing that was done to make Raymond Burr's character actually part of the movie. This was the version I saw as a kid in the theatre on a Saturday afternoon and I still love it. Give yourself a treat and watch it."
4,Subtitles could have been better.,Any Criterion Collection video I own I have thoroughly enjoyed. My only complaint is for a black and white film the subtitles can get lost in the background. Wish they could have made them yellow instead of white.
3,Was exactly what I wanted,I love to collect old monster movies and this one is a classic. We love it on home movie night.
5,See it again...,"Essential a remake of the classic in its own right ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"", this movie was the essential giant movie in Japan and who's shadow has eclipsed all Toho's subsequent efforts. The miniatures are great cept the firetruck scene. The creature breath is more impressive as a vaporous gas unlike the latter Toho versions. None of the Giant monster movies made after comes close to the dark noirish imagery except for Tri-Star's remake."
2,I Grew Up With Godzilla,"I watched Godzilla when I was just a kid and I've been watching it ever since. I guess you could say it's my ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". The acting isn't great by any stretch of the imagination, but there's just something about it that I love! It's entertaining in its own way. I've never been priveleged to see the original movie that this one was based on. I'd love to sometime, but for now, as bad as the movie purists say this is, I love my Godzilla!!"
2,ok,"This is ok but, I have three reasons why it got two stars. 1. should not of put Burr in it 2. 20 minutes cut out ( or something like that) 3.Classic scenes are cut out"
2,poor effort,i have read that TOHO has just remastered (sept 2009) this in 4K HD 1080p and it is pristine-it is also pillarboxed-so you see more than the DVD $65 at YESASIAall region no subs-but we all know the story by heart dont we?
4,Let's put it into perspective,"I own three DVD versions of this same movie.The Simitar version is the best. I have not been blessed to have seen the original japanese presentation of this great monster movie,but I hope to somehow,someway. But we're supposed to review this version. IT'S DEFINATELY THE BEST OF ITS TYPE even WITH Raymond Burr. Better than THE GIANT BEHEMOTH, better than THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, better than GORGO, way better than REPTILICUS and far better than the 1998 American version that bastardize the name Godzilla."
2,The Other Godzilla,This movie is alright. But I saw the original 98 minute versionwith sub-titles. That was better. Does anyone know if its available anywhere. Last version was dubbed.
4,Where's the American version?,"Although I do prefer the original Japanese version,this blu-ray disc doesn't have both versions of the movie. Am I missing something?"
3,Where is the original????,I'm really hoping that with the original version of the movie making it's way around the country that it eventually makes it to DVD as I havn't been anywhere near any of the the cities that are showing the original...unAmericanized...version of the movie.
3,"First, but not necessarily the best.","I'm writing reviews for each of the godzilla movies, so this is going to be short and to the point.Summary: ""A giant, prehistoric monster is released upon Japan after being awakened from its long slumber by atomic bomb testing.""Good starting point for the series with lots of atmosphere and tension. However, the absence of a second monster slows the film's pace a little.next is ""godzilla raids again""."
1,What a piece of crap.,"The ultimate Godzilla is the original, Japanese version (Gojira/Godzilla) in Japanese with English subtitles. After seeing it in it's original form, I would never again want to see the staging done with Raymond Burr. Come on! It's less a story about the Terrible Lizard that attacks Japan and more a story of the terrible actor who is looking for another vehicle. It may have hooked American audiences in it's day and you may want a copy for your collection, but upping the price and calling it the ""Criterion Collection."" Surely you have something else you want to buy."
4,not bad.,"I recently started belly dancing, and I didn't want to have to borrow my friends hip scarves anymore, so I found this and thought it was an awesome price.Well after trying it out I'm not 100% impressed, because the coins don't reach around completely so it doesn't make as cool of a jingly sound as I wanted.But other than that it works great and the coins aren't threating to fall off."
4,ok for practice scarf.,"This scarf is ok for practice scarf. The one I rec'd was slightly shorter than advertised so if your looking for a longer scarf, these are probably not the best choice. But the color was nice, and so far the coins have held up under the stress of dance practice.Good purchase for an ""economy price""."
4,Nice scarves!,These scarves are good quality and very reasonably priced I will be buying more!I would recommend these scarves!
4,Hip scraves,Nice pc for the money. Note if your over a size 16 this will not work for you. Its cool for the money good to practice in.
5,Beuatiful Toiletry Bag,I take this on all my trips (and I do travel often) and it has come quite in handy. I like the interior and exterior leather smoothness and there is plenty of space for all my toiletry needs. Fits into my bag well and it looks nice too so its a wonderful piece of luggage
4,"Good, practical information.",Found many practical tips. Helped separate facts from myths about supplements. Very reader friendly...not over my head with medical jargon.
1,Misleading Title,"The description of the book ""illustrate them with 150 inspired examples"" is very misleading. The author talked about 150 riffs. You are supposed find the actual riff tabs somewhere else. After buying this book, you may need to buy another 100 books to find the 150 riffs the author discussed about. Skip this book."
2,Insufficient and lacking...,"I thought this book would be current on hardware, but the coverage of many important parts like 100mhz motherboards, the AMDK62, AGP, and DVD were inadequate. Instructions were skimpy and the lack of figures and graphics left me guessing alot. The author supplies very little background material for any part of the PC. I guess he thinks you are supposed to know it already. This book is not for the beginner and I am sure the experts don't need it. I'm looking for a better book."
4,Reviews Refer to Older Editions . . .,"Many, if not all, of the reviews listed here for this title refer to older editions and readers should take note of that. This is the edition that should satisfy previous reviewers who wanted to see this book brought up-to-date in 2000."
1,Only good for unintentional comedy,"Horrendous. That pretty much covers it.I made the mistake of seeing this set in a store, and it seemed like a good price for three CDs of music. Turns out, 'music' is somewhat overstating the case. This is pretty much useless unless you want to get surrounding people really mad at you (and, I have found, it is quite useful at that).The first track had no lyrics. I thought ""Boy, this should really have lyrics"". During the second track, I rescinded that thought.... I can't even say how bad this is. I'm trying, and failing. Oh well."
3,"good sound, crappy screen","its a pretty good mp3 player for the price. but the screen tends to go blank on me a lot. but other than that, i like it.p.s. im over 13, im 15, just didnt wanna go through the trouble with the name and what not"
4,another race horse 'hero',"Before Seabiscuit and the other Kentucky Derby wonders of recent years, there was ""Old Bones"", actually named Exterminator. Bought for other race horses to practise with, a few people realize his potential and he wins the Kentucky Derby."
5,Reliving a piece of my childhood,This was one of my favorite books growing up - one of the reasons was because this horse retired to a farm in my area of the southern tier of New York State. I look forward to reading it again and reliving the joys that it gave me back then.
3,"great game, installation problems",the game is great but my daughter needed install help and recieved scripted non useful answers.After googling the problem she was having she was able to get a patch that took care of installation.
1,Too bad I can't rate a book -100 stars.,"Every topic it discusses, C++, CORBA, design patterns, frameworks etc. is discussed in a superficial manner.A person who has any knowledge of the topics will find that they learn nothing new reading this book. A person who has no experience in any of the topics will not learn enough to do anything usefull.Frankly, this book falls into the category that all too many new technical books falls into. One gets the feeling that the reader is suposed to take notes using a crayola."
4,An excellent book on Frameworks/C++,"An excellent book on Frameworks and C++. Although some reviewers have written quite scathing reviews, I find the topics the book coveres are really good and useful. The sidebars are quite good and informative. However, this book is not for those people who are used to read ""blue-sky"" Java books. I recommended this book for strong C++ people."
2,Not enough detail,"I am thoroughly dissappointed with this book. I purchased it because I am in the middle of a project that requires the use of CORBA. I am now purchasing another book, since this one did not cover the topic in enough depth to make me comfortable with the technology.I would consider the book an overview of framework development. It attempts to cover enough material to allow C programmers to transition to C++ OOP. It wastes a lot of time rehashing the same points repeatedly, which gets real tiring after the 10th time you've read the same point. Since it tries to cover so much material, it fails to obtain the necessary depth in any of them. It teaches just enough to whet your appetite for a better book.Finally, the title is misleading. It is not an advanced book, since it only covers the basics of C++, OOP, UML and CORBA."
5,A book for a computer science major - not a cook book.,Deals with concepts of OOP and introduces the OO framework and then object model for CORBA. It is deals more with the concepts behind the code rather than give you code samples to cut and paste. Many of the programming concepts are intuitive if you know where you are and where you want to go. This book gives you an idea about the starting point and the final destination in OOP and couple of known paths to get there.
3,Recycled text; pictures excellent,"This is a rehash of Foner's earlier books on Reconstruction. Nothing new there, except that his Marxism is finally out of the closet. (His main criticism of Reconstruction is that it was not seized as an opportunity for land redistribution and the introduction of socialism in the US). The alternating chapters on photos by Joshua Brown are, in pleasant contrast, fascinating, new and well-done. Foner chapters: 0 stars; Brown chapters: 5 stars; thus average rating."
4,Worth reading,"I was interested in this book in part because I'd heard of Bryher in connection with the poet H.D., and in part because it was recommended by the author of Reading Lolita in Tehran, Azar Nafisi, who, I figured, gets a lot out of her reading. She's definitely right about Visa for Avalon. It's half suspense/half political allegory, about several friends who belatedly realize that their (unnamed) country has been taken over by a totalitarian movement while they were involved in their own lives. They decide to leave for another country called Avalon, which they don't know much about, and set about to get visas and to get out before the borders shut down. It is beautifully written -- lyrical, observant, and concise. It reminds me a bit of Coetzee.The novel apparently draws on Bryher's experience in helping Jews escape the Nazis -- she lived in Switzerland in the early part of the war and helped many people escape Germany. And the book clearly resonates in the politics of the world today."
3,Suspenseful but not thought provoking,"A woman is informed by the government that her property willbe expropriated in order to build a factory, presumably aprivately owned facility. This causes her and her friends todecide to leave the country.It reminded me of how in the United States today, there areplenty of examples of the government forcing land owners tosell to build state sanctioned shopping malls and the like.While, I find such use of government power dismaying, usingsuch an event to paint the society as totalitarian seems overthe top. The author could have found better clues (introducedlater in the story) for her characters that the society theylive in had become totalitarian."
2,Not really an administrator's guide,"This book only provides an overview of the product, and should be not used as an administration guide.It contains a good coverage of topics, although the level of detail is inconsistent. For example, the author spends 4 pages explaining how to create an FTP script; whereas more relevant topics are barely touched on.Another dislike I have is that the material and the examples cover a Sybase implementation. Most PeopleSoft implementations are on Oracle."
2,No depth,"I bought this book, opened it once, and put it back on the shelf. It provides so little depth and detail that it is almost useless. For a brand new technical person I'm not sure this book would be valuable, but it does provide a high level oversight of the workings of the system and would be useful for a Project Manager new to the PeopleSoft area."
4,Overall a good book capturing the various building blocks,"Having been to the training sessions for Peoplesoft technical training, this book is a good summary for those who have already been through the training. However if you want to pick up this book and expect to become an Administrator you will be disappointed.Overall a pretty good guide."
2,PeopleSoft Consultant for 2 years,"This book covers numerous topics, but did not go into depth on each. It definitely serves well as a check list of deliverables and guidelines for a successful implementation."
2,A good start but......,"A good book to have in your PeopleSoft library. It does give someone with a (very)good understanding of Database Administration a heads up about ""PeopleSoft"" and how to implement and plan integration with (different) Hardware Platforms.As a seasoned DBA, I found the book lacking in depth and concentration on configuration and performance issues.A good start but more is needed."
4,I loved it!,"It was a bit young and simple, but I still loved this book. It had a familiar plot that was made original, though I did think that it had a rather abrubt ending. Things didn't really speed up until the last 50 or so pages, though the long beginning wasn't boring. It was surprisingly a lot different from Firebringer and the Sight, which had similar plots. Rhodri, after finding the Telling Pool, needs to find the sword Excaliber to free his father's heart. It takes place after King Arthur's age, where he is only a story. All in all, it was pretty good, if rather rushed."
3,The Telling Pool,The story is well told. But the reviews and jacket information tell only part of the story. Parents need to know for their children that this book has not only themes of adventure but also very strong themes of spirituality. Jesus is portrayed not only as a myth but also as simply a man who married Mary Magdelene and had children. Wiccan is protrayed as the most powerful faith - that of the God and Goddess. And it is ultimately the Wiccan beliefs that help Rhodri the main character.The story is well told and certainly the author is free to express whatever he wants in terms of beliefs but for parents there does need to be information regarding the spiritual themes in order to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish their young children to read this book/
1,INCORRECT DIAGRAMS & NO SCRIPTS ON WEB SITE,"THIS IS BAD NEWS!!!! LOTS OF INFO LEFT OUT, PICS IN BOOK DO NOT CORRESPOND TO SCREENS OF VWD, BOOK SAYS DATABASE SCRIPTS ON WEB SITE, BUT NOT THERE. APRESS IS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE ""WROX"" AND THAT AIN'T GOOD!!!!!"
3,Clear discussion but book marred by lots of typos,"This book is very well written and a lot of thought was given by the authors as to the presentation of the material and how much background to assume the reader has. I would give the book five stars based on the writing. However, the writers were not well served by the editor, as there are many typos, maybe as many as one every other page. It appears that the proof reading was done by someone without a math background, as many of the errors are obvious, such as an equal sign being omitted, turning an equality into a product. Or the length of the sides of a right triangle being given so that the hypotenuse is not the longest side. Sometimes the answers to questions are messed up, which is very frustrating. Hopefully when the book is republished, it will be given the care it deserves."
2,Beware!...this movie stinks!,"This movie was a big disapointment i grew up on the three ninjas movies and this one stunk,i mean they slap in three noname kids to play the parts,and a few washed up actors and call it ''an exelent follow up.'' I wanted to throw colt off of that lookout tower they were on,to bad his nostrils would've worked as parachutes,and his mullet would have cuoght hold of something,and tum tum was a little shrimp,and rocky,they expect us to believe he had a girlfriend? this movie sucked!"
5,SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST!!!,"GET READY TO BE BLOWN AWAY! First, you get non-stop, crotch-knockin', light-up-the-eyes ninja action! Throw HULK HOGUN into the mix! That's right, I said HULK HOGUN! Then, bring Ernest into the picture! And mix it all up at MEGA FLIPPIN' MOUNTAIN!! MEGA MOUNTAIN! I used to love to go to mega mountain as a kid, and now we have a 3 NINJAS movie right there! What more could you ask for? This movie was dangerous! They had guns, and they were taking over the park, but guess who saved the day? NOt only the 3 NINJAS, but HULK HOGUN! You couldn't possibly get anything better in a movie! I was scurred, but I knew everything would turn out right with THE 3 NINJAS AND DAVE DRAGON! Nobody in their right mind would EVER mess with Dave Dragon. You'll get your eyes lighted-up! Then Tum Tum will rock your crotch! Watch out! GET THIS MOVIE!!"
1,They HAD to be High when they made this,"dig this, yo brethrin, hold your hand limp, facing your left. then pound your chest like that saying repeatedly ""I am Wee tod edd"" then have someone watch you."
1,3 ninjas HIGH at Mega Mountain,"They had to be HIGH when they made this movie. HOLY CRAP. Hogan's hair is fake just like his acting. Grandpa went from a wise old man to a stupid old bat. The kids want to leave him at the first part of the movie, but it's never menchened again. At the end it has no menchen of the previous elements in the movie. Grandpa is probobly the best actor of all of the caracters though. Tum Tum and Colt are the worst. I wish that they made a game so that I could repeatedly kill Colt. This isn't a real 3 ninja's movie anyway. It's practically all about Dave Dragon and his gay power rangers. If you want a real 3 ninjas go with Kick Back or the other 2.P.S. Colt has the gayest lisp ever. He really doth"
5,GREAT MOVIE,I LOVE KARATE MOVIES AND THIS ONE WAS FUNNY AND VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE SAD THAT ACTORS LIKE JIM VARNEY DIED AND VICTOR WONG DIED BUT STILL A GREAT MOVIE
3,Aggresive content and style,"The book does a good job at putting the ""big"" picture together; great style of technical writing.The code presented in the book is very simplistic and not of much use in real life, even though it is appropriate for teaching purposes.It is very aggresive while trying to cover too much ground in one book, leaving some empty holes at times. It does however accomplish its goal and main purpose of covering all neccesary technologies (at least the very basic ones) to deploy an intranet."
4,A Good Goulet Mix,"I thought I had heard all of the stuff that Mr. Goulet had recorded on vinyl. Well, guess again. There are some songs on here that have never been released, and they are quite good. This compilation is an interesting mix of songs recorded on different albums. For my money the best album Mr. Goulet ever recorded was ""Hollywood Mon Amour"", which was released in 1966.The song ""A Man and A Woman"" from that album is on this CD. A few selections from the album ""I Remember You"" are included as well. This is an inexpensive treat, so enjoy."
5,50 million times,"I've watched this video 50 million times ! Around there , anyway . I love it ! It's so cool ! I'm like a HUGE fan of Jump 5 , I'm so crazy about them , so when I finally got this , the $(...) I paid for it was worth it . If it was $(...) , I still would have bought it . The interviews are cool , I have the same tv as Brittany does ! I LOVE the music video for Start Jumpin' , it's my 2'nd favorit next to Spinnin' Around .

5,Drumming for healing,"My native American Spirit Guide who helps me do emotional clearing on people during my energetic healing sessions told me to get a drum a few months ago. Since purchasing this drum he has guided me on drumming and chanting together and I am loving every minute. The structure of this drum is excellent. I think it will last a ling time. And the sound, of course, is amazing. You are able to play it loud or soft or anywhere in between."
5,Brilliant deep tone,I was very pleasantly surprised by the wonderful tone and quality of this drum. I proudly use it in Drum Circle. Definitely recommend it for adults as well as older children.
3,Suspended in air,Meandering midnight moodiness with occasionally crisp contrast really just sounds by-the-numbers-intriguing to me.
3,the kids will like it,"It's a bit corny with the narration by Dave, but my son (3 y/o) just loves it. He enjoys the entire Real Wheels series."
4,Fun for boys and girls!,"As with most of the Real Wheels series, Dave and Becky do a fantastic job on a kids level. My son enjoyed all 3 parts of the dvd. Keep up the good work!"
2,don't buy this cd,"I ordered this cd with another one from the same artist.This one was used and the other one was supposed to be brand new but the cds were terrible,they appeared to be scratched and they keep skeeping when i try to play them.I wouldn't recommend them"
3,"Nice pictures, but some what out dated","I have found this book somewhat out dated in it's information. It has color pictures that are nice but some , not all of the training methods are out of date. For the most part the book talks about training wild caught / wild Greys, not hand weaned Greys that now can be bought almost at any pet store. If you are going to be a new African Grey owner, or you own an African Grey keep looking for another book. Wrong information can be harmful to your pet bird. For a good book with good pictures check out ""African Grey Parrots"" by Annette Wolter. So far out of the three books I read on African Greys this one was the most up to date."
3,Somewhat outdated training manual,"The methods used to train Greys to speak in this book are somewhat outdated when compared to those used in Irene Pepperberg's lab (and now by others). The author encourages the use of food rewards to reinforce talking. While this works, what it will give you is a mimic, not an ""independent thinker."" Because this is a reprint of a 1979 text, there is a lot of more up-to-date information on the internet that discusses methods for helping Greys to express what they already know how to do. Look for ""Irene Pepperberg"" ""Alex"" and ""Sally Blanchard."""
1,Outdated Material,"This book is very unreliable and possibly offers some disastrous information for a first time Grey owner that does not know any better...the material is very outdated. With all the new information that is available today, this book suggest things that we know now to be harmful--such as clipping only one wing, keeping a bird out in winter, etc...in it's time (1979), this book might have been imformative, as not much was known about Greys then, but is no longer of any use. I was very disappointed. For a more up to date book, with excellent and up to date information, I suggest ""Guide to a Well-Bahaved Parrot"" by Mattie Sue Athan."
4,The Ultimate Monster,"They should have included ""Gigantis"" in this collection. But it's utterly enjoyably, from the two little singing twin girls in ""Mothra"" to the sad ending in ""Rodan"". The ""Godzilla"" print is of poor quality, I've seen much better, but it's still ""Godzilla"". If you're a true Godzilla fan, you won't be sorry if you buy this collection."
4,"Good Line up, great quality","It's Great to see these classic films in such great quality, but there are very few things that make this set lose a star. First off the lack of special features. next is the absence of a few essential classics, namely 1.Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero 2.Destroy all Monsters and 3. godzilla vs. the Cosmic Monster (a.k.a. Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla). It looks as though a second box set is in order Overall a must have for any fan."
4,Destruction Destruction Destriction,"Firsto of all, What an awesome 5 disk boxed set! this is a great intodution for those who whave never seen Godzilla before. This set has DESTRUCTION written all over it! the set is awesome but ""Godzilla's Revenge"" which is included in the set isn't a good movie at all. It would've been better if they put ""Destroy All Monsters"" in there instead. To me ""Godzilla's Revenge"" is a bore but the other four dvd's are awesome. In ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"", Godzilla really pitches a fit. and of course the movie ""Rodan"" shows what destruction is all about. ""Godzilla King of the Monsters"" is great to because he smashes the heck out of Tokyo Also ""Godzilla vs Mothra' is reaaly destructive too. Over all, this set deserves a few A+'S for all the destruction it has. But godzilla's revenge has reduced my grade to a B."
3,DVD Boxset of U.S. Versions,"This is a fairly nice 5 disk box set of classic Godzilla movies. The quality is decent, but don't expect the crystal clear image quality of today's releases. These generally look and sound just like they did when you watched them on TV 20 years ago.Most disappointing to me is that these films are presented in 1.33:1 pan & scan instead of the original widescreen aspect ratio. All the films are Englished dubbed, no original language sound tracks included."
4,Great Value,"With The exception of Godzilla's Revenge (which is probably the worst Godzilla movie ever!) I couldn't have asked for a better set, especially considering the price. 4 of the 5 are solid films, and did I mention the price!?!"
5,best gift pack ever,"this pack is AWESOME!here is the order i like the movies in 1.godzilla,king of the monsters 2.godzilla's revenge 3.rodan 4.terror of mechagodzilla 5.godzilla vs. mothra.actualy i like king of the monsters and revenge the same."
1,Some great kaiju film ruined by awful transfers!!!,"Even if you are a die hard Godzilla fan, don't waste your money on these DVDs. Print quality is poor. The widescreen films and cropped. The color is faded. The prints are scratched. Another opportunity wasted by a company that just did not give a damm about it's product. And TOHO wonders why there is such an underground trading network in the high quality imports from Japan. With abominations like these, it's no wonder."
3,A collection of classic Godzilla films,"While the set itself looks nice in the artbox, and is at a good value price, skip this release. On September 5, 2006 Classic Media will be re-releasing these same films, plus Godzilla Raids Again and Ghidrah the Three Headed Monster (but minus Rodan, which is rumored for re-release later). The new releases will feature both American and Japanese versions of the movies, and in their original aspect ratios (and with great extras!). Bottom line, only get this set if you're a casual movie viewer and don't care if your films are hacked up to be formatted to the screen. If you're a hardcore G-fan, I'm sure you already knew all this. (I would like to add, the rating I gave reflects the film presentation, not the actual films themselves.)"
1,Far worse than I could ever have imagined.,"This box set is a complete waste. These versions are the reason giant monster movies get a bum rap. These are the same old tired versions that aired on tv. Anyone who has any of these movies on video, should just keep your videos and forget about it. All the companies out there who plan on making a fast buck with poor versions of movies, keep your crappy DVDs we don't want them. It is about time that we get some quality versions of the older monster movies. In Japan you can get every film uncut and in widscreen; why can't we be treated the same, isn't are money just as good. We are fans who love these films and want to enjoy the very best version that we can. In the future please think of the many fans out there. We will probably be the ones that buy 99% of the movies and we know when we get cheated."
4,not bad,"I have to admit the King of the Monsters. The original black and white film was the most content full movie. The rest are geared towards children. I guess that's ok because most of us watch Godzilla to bring back the past. As so with other shows like Dracula, Frankenstein, Creature from the Black Lagoon, or even Johnny Quest. Anyway, these Godzilla films should be passed on. The favourite in my book is the Terror of Mecha Godzilla. I've seen the recent release of Godzilla vs. Mecha Godzilla and I don't like the name Kiryu or Mecha G as they call it. The original just has a better body suit Mecha Godzilla.The only thing about this box set is that it is in Pal format and I wish they had the wide screen. I guess we'll have to wait until Sony and Toho Ltd. re-release all 24 movies.By the way I can't wait til Godzilla Final Wars comes out here in the United States. The final Godzilla movie is worth taking your children to watch I guess."
4,Just one beef with this CD,"It's a direct transfer from vinyl to CD, all the scratching noises can be heard. The record company should try to do a digital re-master so that all the glory of this group can be shown in a better light.This being said, I do love the songs on this CD and I personally like Johnny Mann Singers better than Ray Conniff Singers."
5,Great beginner's book for Astronomy,"This is a great resource for either the beginning hobbyist, or the well-experienced professional.Ottewell is a master geometer, and the crown jewel of the book is his series of drawings, showing, in great detail, the structure of the Universe, from a larger and larger perspective. Each sphere has a small sphere drawn in the center, which represents the previous sphere. Each drawing also labels the well-known objects which we can see from Earth.Some unusal features include a distance-scale chart, a treatment of the difference between the actual and the apparent, a discussion of the various planes used to chart the sky, and he also does a wonderful job covering comets, asteroids, and other 'transitory' phenomena.An exemplary book; if you like astronomy, this one is essential, as it offers a wonderfully accurate perspective."
4,Best Layout Pouch,"I use 4 or 5 different belts in the course of a job and this one hangs on 2 of them. It keeps the square handy and doesn't get in the way of other tools in the many pouches on my belts. Now, if they only offered it in a left-handed version..."
3,Not For The Pro,"This is a nice item, probably geared more towards the weekend project person. I used mine everyday for a couple of months before the stitching wore out. It is great for those who don't like wearing full-on belts. It is backwards for a right-handed person, I like using the square with my left hand and this seems set up so the square is used by the right hand. Overall, this is a great idea, although with some tweaking could be a great product for the pro."
5,THIS WAS STILL IS,"MICK ABRAHAMS IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDER-RATED GUITARIST ON THE PLANET. THE FACT THAT ""THIS WAS""/ {JETHRO TULL} IS THE BEST ALBUM THE GROUP EVER MADE BECUSE OF MICK'S PRESENCE, IS IRRELEVANT. HIS WORK WITH ""BLODWYN PIG"" SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO SHOWCASE HIS TALENT. UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES TALENT ISN'T ENOUGH TO SELL ENOUGH UNITS TO SATISFY THE POWERS THAT BE. IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ALREADY KNOW HOW GOOD THIS MAN IS, THEN I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANOTHER WORD."
2,A buddy film - a disappointing DVD.,"I was seeking an objective documentary about crop circles. This is not it. This is a buddy-film.Peter Robbins, noted UFO researcher and author interviews Colin Andrews, noted crop circle researcher and author about conspiracies and cover-ups and personal mistakes made. Chatty interview, not very informative. The only real value in the DVD is the photo gallery located in the ""extras"" section."
2,A buddy video - disappointing,"I have been seeking an objective documentary about the history of crop circles. This is a buddy video. Peter Robbins is a UFO author/researcher interviewing Colin Andrews on his experiences with crop circles. Lots of talk of cover-ups, conspiracies, mistakes made and the CIA. Not much worthwhile information in the DVD. Disappointing.In the ""extras"" section there are some interesting photos.This DVD is worth about $5.00"
3,All hope is not lost,"Mrs Lessing continues telling the story of Mara and Dann whom we left at the Farm in Ifrik in ""Mara and Dann"". Dann soon returns to the Centre together with Griot - who had been a soldier under General Dann back in Agre - Ali, her daughter Tamar and the snow dog called Ruff. They plan to rescue as many refugees from the south as possible and turn them into the Red Blanket army. At the Centre, they assemble all the technical knowledge left there by the long extinct civilisations of Yerrup because the place is slowly sinking into the marshland. Finally they make their way for a city in the Tundra where they hope to set up a community based on the knowledge the scribes and savants studied and collected at the Centre.It is a slightly disappointing sequel to ""Mara and Dann"" which lacks the latter's intensity because the plot is sluggish and less like the adventure the reader enjoyed in the first novel."
3,"Less meaty than Mara and Dann, still provoking","Where Mara and Dann is more concerned with survival in a post-second-Ice-Age world, this sequel focuses on the preservation of information --what little of it remains-- against losing odds.Lessing's stripped-down writing style leaves me wanting more sometimes in this novel (which makes it a slightly-less-great read than its predecessor), but by the book's end I wondered if it was meant to mimic Dann's shy attempts at storytelling."
2,Trip to nowhere,"After the first novel, ""Mara and Dan,"" which was a stimulating foray into the Earth's future, this novel was a disappointment. It seems as if Lessing had a gun held to her head forcing her to write a sequel or else, when in fact she had nothing new to say about these characters or the setting."
2,"Shallow coverage of servlets, may be of use for beginners","I flicked through this title in the bookshop, while looking for some good servlet titles. The coverage of this book is pretty shallow - for example their only mention of cookies is an API listing. Most servlet books cover cookies and session management, as well as more advanced (but related) servlet topics. I'd highly recommend ""Inside Servlets : Server-Side Programming for the Java Platform"" by Dustin R. Callaway instead."
2,Poor book for Java Servlets,"Moss is good in JDBC, so nearly 1/3 of the book focus on JDBC instead of java servlets, if you are really want to learn servlets, don't buy this book.As I said above, the book focus on JDBC, not servlet, so the material covered on servlet is not enough, especially for beginner, they may not even know how to get a parameter from a form.Read oreally or wrox instead, don't buy this book if you really want to learn servlet. Only buy this when you like JDBC on java servlet."
5,A great book to learn the ins and outs of servlets,"This book not only gives you a great introduction to programming servlets (including hosting and configuration, chaining, etc.) but also delves into related topics such as HTTP tunneling and using introspection to simplify servlet programming. I especially liked the amount of JDBC/RMI information included in the book since many servlets written will want to interface to other Java servers or databases. Having written an article on servlets for BYTE, I was pleased to find this much information packed in the book. My only disappointment is that the author didn't include more on managing state with servlets (e.g. through cookies) and about the future of servlets (covering developments such as Servlet Beans, and the impact, if any, of EJB on the servlet standard). All in all, a great servlet book!"
4,OK OK,"I am a Microsoft Certified VB programmer, trained in C as my first language, who is trying to crossover to Java. The whole notion of servlets and what they can do for you as compared to MTS solutions, is incredible. So for me, this book was an excellent first book. I found the explanations to be clear, though not everything I tried ""worked"" as it was supposed to. Might have been user error; I don't know. I found it very difficult to get the examples to run by importing into JBuilder2, which is my IDE. Required a good deal of tweaking. But once I did, the examples really helped. As everyone but me probably knows before buying this book, there are equally good examples available with the free JDK, and with JavaWebserver free demo. Whatever, I found the book very useful."
2,This book is completely useless,"There's nothing in-depth here, no good code examples, it's crap, and it's expensixe. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought it, I should be shot! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
3,Servlets Lite,"Looked good, but the second that I had to do something that wasn't apparent from the JavaDocs, this book left me without a guide. Therefore, I count it as a waste of time for me, but I can see how the book might be interesting to others.I just bought O'Reilly's book on Servlet programming, and it answered my immediate question. Hopefully, it will age."
1,Who edited this thing?,"The book seems like a bomb someone dropped then ran. They leave no contact information for book updates, like they don't want you to find them. After reading through it and using some of the code samples, I found they were terribly written. I also found completely false information inside. They state, and I quote ""The POST method on the other hand, causes the data to be encrypted and sent in a seperate transmission"". - Which is completely false. If this is dead wrong, who knows what else in there is?? This guy gives servlets a bad name... where are the other servlet books?"
1,I hate this useless book.,"I truely dislike this book. I've been programming for many years, and programming in java for the past year or so. I love servlets, but i hate this book. apart from being absolutely useless, it's also very expensive. I have not found it useful to solve any real problems.a good bet for someone who wants to learn how to write servlets would be to get the Servlet Tutorial from Javasoft, and go from there."
3,Good book but wrong title,"This is a good Java book but not a good Servlet book. The Author covers HTTP tunneling , JAR packing , JDBC driver using HTTP etc in depth. All very usefull stuff but not really servlet specific. The book does not deal with real servlet issues (session , security, JSP -->this is new) etc. Had those Servlet specific topics been dealt with, it would have got a 5* rating from me."
3,Great for Java Servlet newbies,"This is a good book to get the Java Servlet novice up and running writing simple servlets. A great first book, but I agree with other reviewers that the book doesn't cover Session handling enough, and nothing on security issues. However, the book has a good example of implementing database connection pooling. The book has a bias towards JRun, great if you've chosen to use JRun."
3,First serious book on Servlets but not comprehensive.,"It is nice to have this book to get acquainted with the servlets. What is great about the book is that it covers HTTP tunneling, which is not even mentioned in most of the Java networking books. But all the topics are touched very shollowly. No information about security, performance issues, or nothing on session tracking or cookies."
1,Not up to the mark,Could be a lot better Very few examples and most of them similar to Javasofts tutorial Not worth the money Quarter of the book is API reference Couple of chapters are just advertisements of JRun No readme provided for executing indevidual examples Book writen in haste
1,Just not enough information.,Nice pictures but if only they gave more in depth explanations to go with it. This book is for managers or people just interested in java servlets than actually writing code. It is of no use for programmers. You can't use it as a reference because there just isn't enough information to go by.Get Jason Hunter's book. Its excellent!
3,Wish it would open more easily,"I'd seen other Saunder's products with other reviews complaining about the difficulty in opening. This unfortunately, is true. It's not very professional to have to struggle with the thing every time you use it! I have to struggle to open it quite a bit. I also wonder how long the divider in the middle will last before the plastic hinge wears down. Storage-wise this is a better item for those who have a LOT of knick knacks to store. I wanted something so I could stash a few pens, a slim calculator and a lipstick, but this has more compartments and they are deeper than the document storage. I'd prefer if the thicker compartment was for docs and and maybe had more dividers for documents."
1,nice idea but not big enough,"This would be PERFECT if it held paper like it shows in the photo! When papers are placed into that file folder, the edges are clipped into the side. It does NOT hold standard sized paper without damaging-which is the whole point of having a storage clipboard. Very poor design. It needs to be just a bit wider to accommodate what it claims-I returned mine. The description and stock photo are misleading and false."
2,"Great ingredients, but horrible smell & taste!","My daughter HATES taking these. The ingredients are great and natural, but my daughter cannot stand taking them because of the smell and taste (even though she has to swallow them). The other thing is that your kid has to take 2 of them a day, not 1. I'd rather give my daughter 1 with everything in it and be done! Will order something different next time."
3,George Lopez?,"The Krofft shows are just as pleasingly bad as you remember. The Si Rose interview is excellent. But I am still scratching my head as to why George Lopez is doing commentary on the Lidsville episode. All he does is describe the action on the screen like he has never seen the show before, laughs half-heartedly at the bad jokes, and worst of all doesn't say anything about the obvious racial sterotypes that abound. If you can't riff on that crap you are not a comedian. He just goes on and on about how great everything is, come on George get the Krofft's wang out of your mouth, you will not be doing a cameo in the ""Land of the Lost"" movie. Definately a nominee for worst commentary ever for a 22 minute kids show."
4,Sat morning shows,I bought this DVD for my girlfriend since she was talking about all the old sat morning shows she use to watch growing up in Long Island in the 70's. After watching the first shows it was like a acid flashback (indeed most of these shows were probley written on acid). Was extremely fun to watch these old shows.
1,Jake's advise = nothing but losses.,Do your research on the internet. You'll be lucky if you break even. For get making a profit. I and many others purchased this book only to be scammed. Jake makes money selling advise in the form of books and other materials. My book was not worth the paper it was printed on. Forbes even had an article on what a scam Jake's future trading is. Stay clear.
1,a lot of information,"trading results for specific a entry day and exit day are given. Since there are 250 (5 times 50 weeks) trading days in a year, then there are 250 times 250 permutations. Which comes to 62,500 possible entry/exit combinations. Apply this to 20 commodities, over 10 years, and different contract months...High probabilities can be found in a random population given such huge number of combinations or 62,500 x10 x20 = 1,250,000Fortunately Jake only gives the the high probablility ones."
4,Great story,This has so far been a great story that I have been very intrigued by. I haven't finished yet but can't wait.
3,Unreasonable ties and stupid ending.,"Even though this book has been around for some time, I decided to read it because I am a fan of Nora's books. There are plenty of reviews to give you a good idea what the books about. My intelligence was insulted however, with the last quarter of the book. Particularly, I did not like how it all fell together. Too many people tied to the grandmother was not realistic nor was the police investigations. We must think police are stupid to believe this ending. No one would let the guiltiest of persons to go free. The police would not put it together on their own is a fantasy of it's own. So much better are other books written by Nora Roberts."
5,One about thoroughbred racing,"This story about the glamourous world of horse racing takes the reader into the sleazy side of the racing world. Nice story line, location moves around to add spice, twists to make the story interesting. Secondary characters play a big role in this story."
4,ENJOYABLE,This was the first book that I read by Nora Roberts. I must say it was an excellent read. Until the end you wondered who was behind the deaths. And you will never believe who it was...But I was dissappointed that Nora didn't have a harsher punishment for the person behind it or did not tell us the reaction when that person was exposed. I will be picking up another book by Nora Roberts and hope it's as good as this one.
3,No true betrayals,"I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts' books, but this one lacked depth. I guess I was expecting/hoping for her usual violence, murder, mystery, with a love story intertwined package. The ""mystery"" was not there - just high school sweethearts reuniting after some time of being forced apart. Underwhelmed by this book - sorry Nora."
4,True Betrayals,This book was great. I will continue to read Nora Roberts and share her books with friends.
5,NORA ROBERTS DID IT AGAIN!,"I HAVE NEVER READ A NORA ROBERTS BOOK THAT I DIDN'T LOVE AND THIS ONE WAS VERY GOOD. THE CHARACTERS WERE INTERESTING AND BELIEVABLE. THOUGH AT TIMES GABE ASSUMED ALITTLE TOO MUCH FOR MY LIKING, BUT IT TAKES ALL KINDS EVEN IN A BOOK. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN ENJ0YABLE BOOK DON'T HESITATE TO PICK THIS ONE UP, ITS A GREAT READ. ALSO TRY MONTANA SKY OR RIVER'S END BOTH ARE REALLY GREAT BOOKS."
4,"If you like horse racing, this book is for you!","I never knew much about the triple crown until I sat down and read this book. I love the way Nora Roberts develops the characters. I thought the scandalous plot was a little corny, but the overall book is quite well-written and entertaining. A little corniness is okay as long as the plot develops, which it does."
4,Excellent reading,Enjoyed the book very much. Fast reading and I always love Nora Roberts novels. Highly recommend this book for your easy reading pleasure.
4,True Betrayals,"Love her books. Although a little predictable, it was still entertaining.This is a nice vacation book because it is a feel good book. Could of read this book all day."
3,True Betrayals,"Kelsey Byden thought she knew her life, but was devastated when she received a letter from the mother that she thought was dead. Naomi thought it best since she was in jail for murder, but now that she is out and found a life of her own, she wants to see her daughter. When Kelsey visits her mother at her horse farm, her life changes forever. It is there that she has to come to terms with Naomi, and meets her future in Gabe.This was a well-written book with a lot of information about horses and horse racing. The interaction between Naomi and Kelsey was very intense, but I found the character Gabe lacking."
5,Excellent surprise!,"THIS WAS MY FIRST NORA ROBERTS READ! WHAT A GREAT ONE IT WAS. THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH KELSEY AND GABE.IT SATISFIED MY OWN LOVE FOR THE HORSE WORLD, LOVE AND MYSTERY! I ACTUALLY CRIED IN THE END AND WAS SAD TO HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE TO THE CHARACTERS!THIS IS A MUST READ. I ONLY WISH NORA ROBERTS WOULD DELIGHT US AND PRODUCE ANOTHER NOVEL DELVING INTO THE FUTURE WORLD OF THE CHADWICKS AND BYDENS, AND NEW SLATER FAMILY."
2,Confusing mess,"I'm pretty new to DataBase programming, and this book is taking me nowhere. The sample code could only be interpretted by one who already knows OLE DB. Anyone out there know of a good book for DB programming beginers??? I have a good understanding of MFC, COM, ActiveX, etc... I just need something to get going on creating custom OLE DB Providers."
3,Non Fiction,"The Microsoft Ole Db 2.0 Programmer's Reference and Data Access Sdk is an occasionally useful guide to using this particular piece of technology and access method, particularly when you are playing around with database servers, or were playing around with database servers at the time.Done in the usual Microsoft reference book style."
1,"Horrible, if you have to write a provider, GOOD LUCK!","Please stop emailing me about books on OLE DB, I have NOT found any better books. Though, I have recently taken a decent course taught be DevelopMentor... though, I'm still not 100% clear on writing providers."
5,So Glad I Purchased It!!,"I loved this movie! I'm an even bigger fan of Deitrick Haddon now. After seeing Blessed & Cursed, I bought the soundtrack! It was an awesome movie and I really enjoyed it. The quality of the DVD was excellent also. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5,Blessed it is!,"I love D.Haddon music, sooooo good for the soul. This is a really good DVD for everyone to see. Just listen to all of his music. I just purchased Church On The Moon. OMG!"
5,Ppl please get this,I have never seen such an amazing and anointed singers in a movie. This movie is so real and refreshing I loved absolutely loved deitrick haddon singing. I wish there was more acting roles for the other casts like Karen clark-sheard and Ms. KIKI SHEARD other than that I really loved watching this movie! Thank you!
4,Blessed,"I was blessed by this DVD. It says a lot about what goes on in a lot churches today, and I believe a lot of us can relate to this one in one way or another."
3,Better Than Expected,"I actually enjoyed this film. I've watched many gospel films that were of poor quality (in production and dialogue). This one actually was okay. There were moments where the dialogue was a bit stiff, and I think the storyline could have been developed a bit more. I did not care for the ending. BUT - with all that said, I would still reccomend it for viewing. I really liked the soundtrack also."
5,Seen it twice now - Finally a REAL Gospel Movie!!!,"Finally, a REAL Gospel movie...Deitrick Haddon really brought it on this one. I am ready for him to do more! I wish this movie was marketed/advertised better so the world could see what we can bring to the table...this was quality all across the board - the message, the acting, the music!!!!, the comedy, and the drama!You gotto really be into music though, because my only criticism of the movie is that it's kinda like a super-sized music video...but it's off tha chain, for real!!! GET IT!!!"
4,Inspirational,"I think sometimes people are overly critical. For what the movie was I thought it was very inspirational and the songs were very good. Deitrick Haddon is a true talent and if this was his first try at writing and directing a movie it was well done and he should get better with it in time. The only dislike I had with the movie was the overacting and unrealistic of actions of KiKi Sheard,I mean you are hysterically crying instead of calling 911, that sort of caught me for a loop. I love god and have faith in the lord but in the real world with medical emergencies we call 911. But, overall the movie was very inspiring too me especially the song ""Mighty God"" it actually inspired me to stop smoking."
2,Confusing,"This was a confusing picture. The way it was shot and the way the story was told had me watching 2 times to understand it. Only after I saw the deleted scenes, then I understood the movies. Some imformation was left out of the movie that should have been left in it. Then this would have been a great movie."
3,blessed and cursed,"this was just a movie i woold have to say it was okay. the movie itself had some excelent authors, when i seen this movie i thought it was interesting, but sitting down watching, it did not crab to much of my attention. so on a scale of 1-10 i would rate this a {6}"
4,mustsee,"I watched this movie and it was well worth the money. I almost cried at the end, it was so touching. Definitely will watch it again with family members, and pass it on to my pastor."
4,Adopting made easier,"We've recently adopted two Ethiopian children who spoke only Amharic when they first came to us. We searched for ages to find a dictionary that would suit our needs for communicating with them and also for teaching them English. After using a tiny phrasebook with limited words and only English-Amharic (one of our children could read well in Amharic) we needed a better way. And after looking through the internet for a while, a found this book and bought it. It's explained many things that before would not have been possible, and made the necessary communication all the easier. It is also helping the kids greatly in their English and understanding of things around them. Thanks heaps!"
4,Understanding Amharic,"As far as I know, this is the only English-Amharic dictionary on earth. So, it is an invaluable help in understanding anything written in Amharic. It is very good that one not has to learn the Amharic alphabet to use the English-Amharic part; all words are written in full using the Latin alphabet, describing the sound of the words. Until now, I have found all words I have been looking for, but sometimes I miss explanations of what the difference is, or if there is no difference, between alternative Amharic words for one English word."
5,Great Babe magnet and Gift,I'm stationed in Ethiopia. This book was great i bought one used it to pick up so many ethiopian chicks i had to give it away as a gift so i bought another and met my wife........Ethiopian ofcourse.
1,good,this is a very interested book a couple of my friends have this book. it is very well written and easy to read.how do i go about purchasing this book.please email me an answer.
4,Good Product,I have a bad back and this has made my trips wonderful. The massaging helps keep my back from tightning up and the heat keeps me comfortable. Anyone with back problems should have one of these.
1,"Horrible, Horrible","There is not a better word to describe this. The vibration is WAY under powered. I can pet my cat she vibrates harder from her purring than this cushion does. I could not even hardly feel it. I got it cheap, and it was a waste of money at any price."
5,A great supplementary guide to using this super program.,"As a graphics professional who is just beginning to explore the techniques of web site design, I found this book a great help: first, it is a good supplementary guide to the manual Adobe provides, and second, it helps explain some technical design principles which are unique to the web. If you have just purchased Imagestyler, I recommend it highly."
2,Waste of Money,"I bought this book long time ago hoping to learn Image Styler by myself, but It didn't help me. There is nothing in this book that was valuable whichI couldn't figure it out by myself, or by the free tutorials available on the web.One important thing I figured out ( and I am speaking for myself) is that Image Styler is not the kind of software that need proper training before being able to use it, every thing is ready made and so clear, except maybe for the Javascript rollovers.Don't waist your money on this book, or any book about Image Styler for that matter. Put your money on more powerful tools such as Photoshop or Flash"

2,Not a hardcore gamer? Then don't bother...,"This game is very difficult for beginners to pickup. After playing the home version with the DC controler I realized how much I miss those twin sticks. Trying to get use to the controls takes a very long time and the pay off isn't worth it.Graphics are only as good as the arcade version (perfect port of the arcade visually), which is now dated.Hardcore Virtual On fans seem to like it a lot, everyone else should pass. There are better rewarding games that take less time to figure out. Oh yeah, where is the Internet play Activision?"
3,The game is impossible to play without the twinstick control,"If you've read anything about this game, then you probably know about the problem with the controls. I'll just re-emphasize that this game is worthless without those twinsticks. Changing direction requires you to move the analog pad while walking has to be done using the normal directional pad... ok maybe if I had 2 thumbs on my left hand?"
2,TWIN STICKS REQIURED - but not included,"This game, I must admit, has beautiful graphics and awesome gameplay. The problem is the controls are designed around a peripheral, which most of you know, called Twin Sticks. Playing the game with a standard controller IS possible and ALMOST fun, but it's like playing Quake without a keyboard, possible but not tolerable. I purchased the game and decided the Twin Sticks were a must, so I attempted to acquire a set. I found that the controllers go for around $75 each AND even if I felt like sinking $150 into one game I didn't have the option because the controllers are not sold in the US (as of June 2000) and all mail-order shops I found were sold out. So unless you already have Twin Sticks (actually Sega Saturn Twin Sticks work with an adapter) I wouldn't purchase this game. Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome, but true gamers won't be able to put up with the lack of control. ---2 stars, for now"
4,Best map of Belize i have found yet,"Having a good deal of detail including minor roads and lots of points of interest, as well as elevation gradient lines, I will find this map very useful in our upcoming trip. Missed the fifth star because only one city map is onset. Wished for two more."
4,Belize travel map,"The map was accurate, had all the sites we wanted to visit, folded nicely and was durable enough for reuse in the future."
2,Needs updating.,"I recently bought this map as a guide for navigating around Belize. I was very disappointed to find that a good percentage of the roads in Belize aren't marked on the map. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to the roads that are not marked, some are minor, some are more major. For example, the major road to Spanish Lookout (which is paved) is not shown at all. However, single track dirt roads to remote locations and are not through-roads are shown. The random nature of which roads are shown or not, as the case may be, make the map unreliable. The topographical information shown does however seem to be accurate."
2,Old map,"This map is out dated and doesn't show many of the secondary roads. I lost this map the first day that I was in Belize, and never missed it. The free map from the department of tourism was just as helpful, if not as detailed."
3,"This is a map, not a paperback","While the map looks great, the Amazon ad for it is misleading. It is not a paperback book, as listed. I was expecting a book-format series of maps, perhaps fold-out. Especially for that price! Not so. It's a fairly flimsy map that may or may not survive the jungle...we'll see when I use it!"
1,Not so good,Product is made cheap for the price. It is a weird material that doesn't stay in place to easy. It also tore in multiple spots and couldn't be cleaned after one time. Not that I would use it again. It was useless!
1,Deceptive,"This product is NOT worth even looking at or considering. The ""idea/concept"" is great but the actual functionality was totally a dissapointment. Although it stayed in place the top part did not even do what it meant to do for adding pleasure to woman."
1,Terrible quality control,"The included vibrator comes with 3 button-cell batteries... which do not fit inside the unit. Any more than two batteries, and the end cap will not thread on properly. The vibrator can run with only two batteries but the vibrations are very weak.I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement. Same problem.I suppose one could replace the vibrator with another small bullet-style vibe, but why not just buy a better quality product to begin with?"
2,How to make easy concepts as difficult as possible in 21 day,"Mr. Conley has taken easy concepts & completely obscured them in arcane language that only a lawyer could love. I found myself lost in his description of things I already knew.Remember John, the goal here is not to prove that you know what your talking about, but to pass the knowledge on to new comers. Tip #1: tone down the jargon.I have been working with VB for over a year. ""Teach Yourself"" is a good title for this book because that's exactly what you'll be doing, teaching yourself without much help from the text."
5,Just what I needed,"Having recently bought a jeep, this book was just what the doctor ordered. It's loaded with well written reviews and recommendations for off road adventures all around southern California. I've already done a few of the trails from the book and the reviews and info were very accurate. If you're new to off-roading in southern California, this one is a must."
4,Great detail on the routes but little other information,"This is the third of Mr. Wells' books that I have purchased. As best I can tell, all have been spot on in their detail as of the time that they were written. Unfortunately, politics and weather can cause some rapid changes. Mr. Wells usually makes comments on this and he can't be blamed for something that he cannot control. Make sure to check the current route conditions before you go or you may be disappointed to find that it is closed.My reason for giving the book only 4-stars is that there is little ancillary information given about the routes. There is a bit of information about mines and photo opportunities along the routes but I was hoping for a bit more information. Knowing why and when the routes were built would be nice knowledge to have."
3,Helpful but flawed,"This book is very detailed and the content is excellent. There are two main flaws. The first, the quality of the book binding is some of the worst I have ever seen. Forget taking the book with you on the trail. I have now had two of these books and both times the book fell apart with casual use within the first two times of flipping through it for trails.Although the appendix does give phone numbers for the forestry service offices for the various trail areas, the biggest problem is many of the trails in this book are closed indefinitely (more than just seasonal closures) according to the forestry offices. This is not a fault of the book, but a result of the southern california fires. The desert roads are mostly open, but forget the mountain and foothill routes for a while. Great book, but be aware before you buy that many of these routes are not legally accessible anymore."
3,Horrible quality,I agree with the other posters- the book is made very poorly. I used it one time and the binding fell apart. Jeep without a top and pages shooting off into the wind... The material inside was excellent
1,disappointing and overpriced,"This 14.95 PAMPHLET is totally overpriced. This zine is so basic that its almost not even like learning flamenco at all. Its a bit like trying to learn flamenco from someone who studied it by watching a video tape frame by frame and is trying to describe the steps to you. The castenets section looks usable, but then i do not know how to play the castenets. Also irritating is the fact that its not worth 14.95! At 3 dollars, this would be a decent extremely general introduction to the dance,...its a total ripoff. The wait time is probably so that the printer can run off a copy on threr inkjet machine and send it out. (its a PAMPHLET!) ps yes i take flamenco classes, hoping this would be a good complement. And its not."
1,Not worth the money,"The book is just that-basics. Actually, it is very confusing. I would not recommend beginers buying this book, take a class instead. ...............I wouldn't waste the money."
1,Item Pictured vs Item Shipped,"It's 10/11/11 and the image displayed for sale is a rotary switch model. The item that will be shipped is a push button model. The rotary switch model is more reliable as I have one still working after 10 years. The push button model is too light of weight and to be used properly the box must be secured down by double sided tape. Also, push buttons have a habit of developing bad contacts after much use. Besides the rotary switch does not need tape to secure it from moving while turning the switch. Still, maybe you would like it more secure too."
2,Wrong product & Loses part of signal...,"Instead of the dial pictured with this listing, the product shipped comes with two push buttons (A and B). That's nothing that would have kept me from buying it... but it's still disconcerting to get something besides what you ordered.What would keep me from ordering this is that although the signal changed from source A to source B (and back) when the appropriate button was pushed... it would change the video signal to a *very* yellow color once you let go of the button. As long as you are mashing the button down all the way with your thumb it is fine. But the second you take your thumb off of the button the image looks like it's being viewed beneath a layer of dark yellow liquid. For this reason I cannot recommend this product."
4,Works well!,"Works well. Would say 5 stars, as it does what it's supposed, however, I had to take the cover off to tighten the screw posts as the inner nut was not tight enough. Would still recommend it though. Good price, good function?"
5,Awesome switch!!,Switch is awesome and works because I wanted to switch from monitor to HDTV. I now can watch Hulu on my 46 inch screen TV!
2,Reduces image quality,"I bought these so I can switch between my second computer monitor and Xbox 360. I didn't notice the difference in quality of the picture when I switched to my xbox 360, but when I turned the switched to my computer, I noticed a huge decrease in image quality. There was an overlapping effect on fonts and images were extremely blurry. I even switched the VGA cables out thinking that was my problem, but it didn't help. It could just be my VGA Switch box though (not sure since it was pretty cheap).All in all, it works... but does not give a clear image."
3,Not what the on line ad showed,"The switch box seems to be OK, but it should be what was shown in the net ads and it was not.This is not good business to advertize one thing and switch the product on the comsumer!!!!!!Darrell"
4,Owned for several years,For me this receiver is very easy to use has no HDMI so beware. The remote wore out wouldn't work anymore had to replace so I would recommend buying an extra one immediately since they could become scarce. I found a replacement remote for around $30. Over all I love this unit and highly recommend Yamaha Receivers over other brands. I also own a Pioneer vsx-819h and like this older Yamaha much better.
4,Very happy with this receiver,"I recently bought the receiver, athena micra speakers, and the xm antenna. I decided to treat myself and get rid of an old mini-system and a roady 2. I am very happy with how xm is integrated with the system. The remote controls took a while to get used to, but that's pretty typical with new electronics... Currently, I am only using this system for music, but I do plan on hooking up my dvd player and tv soon - hopefully I will like this system that much more."
1,not a useful first hand reference,"after running through the relatively few sms 2 books out there, i have to say that this is not one i'd buy again. 1) there are glaring errors such as incorrectly numbered screen captures which are integral to understanding the material. 2) blatantly conflicting information such as where sms can be installed. the book actually lists sms will only work on a domain controller and pages later only to correctly state that member server is the preferred location. the sms administrator's companion by steve d. kacmarek is better by far. that book provides hard to find tricks such as specifying the nic for use with remote control and well written and organized throughout. this book is fine for a relative knowledgeable sms person who wants to read through the book for a refresher course but for beginners, it will only confuse and misinform which goes against its' purpose in the first place."
5,Possibly the most compelling book I ever read.,"Claude Brown gives a wonderful account of the struggles of growing up in a city such as New York. This book is recommended to anyone who isn't afraid to see that their pristine vision of their surroundings is not what they think, or that someone can struggle through their childhood and still come out on top. One of my favorite books."
4,A good read!,"I initially read this book as an undergraduate student in college years ago. Loved it then, despite the sometimes foul language. Here it is 15 years later and I like it more, especially when compared with the contemporary Black so-called writers."
1,Not for me...,This book was extra credit reading for my Psychology class. I did not enjoy any of it.
4,Those who don't remember the past.....,"When this book came out in 1965, the NAACP's magazine ""The Crisis"" and other middle-class blacks criticized this book because it's raw and unsentimental portrait of ghetto life was seen as threatening to the entry of Black Americans into mainstream positions in America at the time. Too bad so many people tuned out it's message. Many of the things Claude Brown spoke of in this book about the Harlem of the mid-20th century came to pass in far more communities than Harlem (massive drug addiction, lunatic Black nationalist cults, massive disrespect of women, mindless violece, etc). Had more people listened to Claude Brown (RIP) at the time, perhaps Black America may have united to rid our communities of these evils instead of irrelevant ""issues"" like the Confederate Flag so that these things would not have become the plauge that they are today. As George Santayana said, ""Those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it."""
4,great camera,"This is my 3rd webcam and by far the best. Great features, software works well and the camera even works with upper end software like Sony Vegas. Quality is pretty darn good for a webcam. Software has neat features like face tracking and software privacy. Quick and painless install too. Oh, and no silly focus ring to mess with. The camera auto-focuses. At first I was a bit skeptical about the weird support design for the base but it's actually a great sturdy design. I can easily hang it off my lcd monitor, set it flat on a desk or hang it off a laptop screen. the audio quality is so/so but it does work. outstanding camera overall."
3,Good Camera!,"This camera didn't live up to my expectations. Plenty of better options available, just wish I knew about them before I bought this. The software was difficult to install and operate. Never got it to work as I wanted it to."
2,No Bells Ringing for this Disaster,"Arthur Freed, the great producer of MGM musicals, must have been sick or on vacation during the filming of The Belle of New York. The terrible script, inferior music and lyrics should have sounded an alarm, but no one was there to here it. Only the dance numbers are worth anything. Everything else is beneath contempt. It's hard to believe that Freed would allow its release. If ever a picture needed a fix, it was this dud. Alas, no one saved it. What a waste of Fred Astaire,Vera Ellen, Alice Pearce, Conrad Salinger and director Charles Walters."
5,White Party 2002 Palm Springs,I went to the White Party 2002 in Palm Springs - it was fabulous! This CD encompasses the erotic feel and ectasy of the weekend. Highly recommended!
2,A terribly disappointed music fan. Don't buy from this DJ.,"I purchased this CD thinking it would be a one-of-a-kind CD but I was terribly dissapointed. I won't even go into detail about the selection of tracks used by this DJ who is extremely boring. He calls this party music, ha ha ha. Also, I accidentally ended up at the Fire Island 2 for LBGP & this DJ happenned to be playing on a Saturday night. Let me tell you, the tracks he used literally skipped as he was trying to mix them. This DJ doesn't have any new material to mix. Masterbeat must not care about achieving good quality music."
4,She Gets 4 Stars for the Cover Alone!,"Before you even open ""All Of Me"", Toni Tennille's sophomore solo set, you'll be dazzled by the cover art--especially if you are fortunate enough to nab it in LP form. Tennille never looked sexier, more gorgeous, or more ""come-hither-y"" than she does here (don't miss the back cover of Toni in leather and stiletto heels). And what's behind that cover does not disappoint.""All Of Me"" is essentially ""More Thank You Know, Book 2"". It blasts out of the chute like a bucking bronco with her rendition of ""How High The Moon"", Andrews Sisters-style, and never looks back. The only thing I didn't love about this album was ""Dream"". I know--this version is much more true to the original in tempo and styling than C&T;'s version on their album of the same name... but wasn't that a luscious way to end that album? Truth be told, ""All Of Me"" would have garnered 5 stars had its predecessor not been as amazing as it was. A definite ""must"" for Tennille-philes!"
3,Better price not so great with slow delivery,"I plan on using UGuard indefinately for my new horse and have bought from various vendors already - I like to compare prices like most conscientious consumers. This being said, though this store offered a better price, the delivery was so slow (3 weeks) that I won't buy from them again!"
1,Subjective objectivity,"Ms. Pulitzer's purportedly ""objective"" expose on circumstances surrounding the death of Nancy Richards Akers is nothing but tabloid fodder told from a single perspective. It completely glosses over vital facts."
1,Avid true crime reader but;....,this book was the only book I have purchased in true crime that I could not get into. I would be lucky if I read 10 pages. I only wish I could have returned it!
4,Short But Fun,"If u r a spiderman fan u would probably like this game i am not particualy but i still think this game is fun, the controls are easy for beginers i should know this is the first game i got for playstation, it is realy short i can beat it in 45 min. the codes are awesome though, EEL NATS will give you everything, you collect comic books throughout the game, and the storyline is alright, the combo web moves are awesome,the bosses you fight include scorpion,rhino,venom,mysterio,doc ock,carnage,monster ock overall this game is good i recomend you buy it, rent it, or borrow it from a friend"
3,its alright but could of done better,activision and neversoft really did do good on the first 12 levels but after that it got real boring this is what i mean the sewers were real boring there wasnt much web swinging in the game either i gave this game 3 stars because it lacks the skills of soidey overall it does have good villians but thats aboat itand the game is somewhat fun but i would rent it first
5,Perfect! Spidey's greatest adventure yet!,"Movies, bad villians, unhappy cohorts, and cool costumes! Spider-Man will brighten any gamer's day with the webbing, the kicking, and the funny pain of other bosses! If you haven't heard of this superhero, rent the game, and you'll be at a video game store with [price]in your pocket."
3,Game is too Short,"I purchased the game around two weeks ago as a birthday present for my brother. We had rented the title previously and liked it a lot. The graphics are quite good, and game play is good too. (The three dimensional immersion effect is quite unique.) The problem is, we completed the game on the first day my brother opened it. Of course, we had saved our progress from before on our memory card, but six days total game play isn't that great -- especially for this type of game. Spider-Man definitely had a lot of potential -- it works on many points -- but it is way too short. It seems like there are levels missing; important plot elements are never concluded. There is almost zero replay value. With so little play value, Spider-Man certainly doesn't feel worth the price."
4,Spider-Man,"This has to be one of the best games I have played in a long time. I was impressed by the graphics being as good as they are, just about n64 quality. Gameplay is where this title really shines though, I dont think I have ever had this much fun controlling an onscreen character before. Even with the control problems it is still fun to send spider-man swinging through New York. Speaking of control problems though, the camera is not the best I have ever seen, its constant changing in order to be directly behind spider-man is sometimes disorienting and can lead you to the game over screen if you are not careful. Even though there are some problems with the controls, the rest of the game more than makes up for it and will soon make you forget that there are any problems at all. If you buy this game you will definitely not be dissapointed."
3,spiderman ps1 game,not bad. It held the attention of my 4 yearold for awhile but then mario DS came around...
3,For an old Playstation game.......still very fun!,"Spider-ManI ordered this game for my 9 year old son. I don't know why he insists on me buying and him playing old Playstation games but he enjoys playing them thoroughly. Spiderman is an excellent, clean, fun Spiderman game."
1,NOT for kids,"This is a horribly violent game to be marketing it to kids! It should have a T rating, I don't know who was asleep at the switch and let this through with an E!"
3,"not bad, not bad","The game is fun for a few hours, but then it just starts getting boring.This game has amazing graphics, real good voice overs, but it's just not worth the 40+ bucks.It takes about 2 days to finish, ones you do, your probable never touch it again.I suggest you rent the game first!"
3,Fun but too bad for the stupid save system...,"I came across this game when I was a small child. After playing this game many times without completion, I now reject this game at all costs. Why? Because I can't finish it!The furthest I got was Level 5 (with Level 3 being the longest). I saved and I came back the next day to finish it. The save game was completely gone. I had to start from scratch. I mean, I'm actually surprised everyone else are able to finish it! And no, it's not a problem with my memory card. It works fine with 28 out of my 30 ps1 games. The other one is Pandemonium 1.This takes a full 8 hours (at my estimation) for completion. If you save and carry on afterwards, you have to start over. Get the other Spiderman games because I'm sure you can finish them. Just rent this game if you're a fan of action games and/or Spiderman. It's actually fun and really interesting to play but because of the bad save system, I'm afraid I can only give it 3 stars."
4,Any Spider-Fan Will Love it!,"Although there are hundreds of superhero games, this simple Playstation game stole my heart. The game is fun. That's pretty much it's only quality. By today's standards, this game has terrible graphics. When it was new, it was fine. But don't let a simple matter as graphics stop you from playing this game. The game lets you into the shoes of Spider Man like no other game can. The game is disappointingly short. However, you will find yourself playing it over and over again. If you're looking for a quality Spider-Man experience, this game is perfect."
4,Excellent,This is a very good game and I think you ought to buy it.You can do almost everything spiderman can do in the TV series.
5,The Amazing Spider-Man!,"This was an excellent game! The graphics are below average, but I thought it was fun to web people up and crawl on the walls and stuff. As I said, the graphics are a bit blurry, but this was a fun game. In it, you encounter such villains as Scorpion, and Venom, etc."
4,Best Super-Hero Game Ever,"To say the very least, Spider-Man is definitely the best overall super-hero game since (oddly enough) Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage for SNES and Sega. It stays true to the actual Spider-Man comic book, which it's fans will appreciate, and it has aspects that will apeal to people who know Spider-Man only by name. The effects are outstanding, and there's plenty of action to go around. The one draw-back: After the game is done and completed, there isn't a real desire to go back and replay the game again, since there really isn't anything new you can experience besides playing Spidey in his famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) black costume. But it's still one of the funnest games to come out in a long while, and a definite improvement over N64's Superman."
5,SWEET AS A CANDY BAR!!,"THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE!! its an awesome game!! THE STORY LINE ROCKS!! except for blackcat being a little inmodest. sweet moves. i say its a little difficult for the beginer. one of my freinds had a little trouble with all the web swinging, but it was'nt that hard for her to figure out the KICK-OFF-THE-BUILDING move. MY BROTHER LOVES IT TOO, AND HE'S THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME!! i'm planning on getting SPIDEY: MOVIE GAME soon.100 PERCENT FUN!!!!!"
4,Nice Dinnerware Set,"My wife and I don't enjoy common dinnerware designs for anything other than casual use. We wanted something for our holidays to set a special mood. This Pfaltzgraff design was just the ticket and the best dinnerware set price we could find was on Amazon.com. Our dinnerware set arrived just in time for Thanksgiving (speedy shipping!) and we were very satisfied with the quality. Nice, durable dinnerware with an awesome color glaze.We did have one problem with 2 bowls cracked in shipment, but Amazon sent out an advance replacement order quickly so we could exchange these for new bowls.I have been very happy with the quality of product on Amazon, the fast shipping, and the excellent customer service to correct problems like this. Yea, Amazon, nice job!P.S. We also bought serving bowls and platters directly fom the manufacturer for far cheaper costs due to their sale prices during the holidays. Pfaltzgraff + Amazon = a great deal.Thanks again. Eric"
4,Good quality and great look overall,"We've had them a year. We bought the large set. They shipped in thin chinese cardboard and several were broken as a result but once replaced we love them. The only issue I have is the small base of the coffee mugs. They are a bit tip prone but it has only happened twice so far. We have microwaved, heated them in the oven and used a dishwasher on them and they have held up well so far."
1,A poorly written self promoting rant...,"This book is an self-indulgent rant. It's telling that it was published by the Human Givens publishing house (i.e. presumably the authors self financing) because no decent editor would accept such rot. The 'Human Givens' concept is repeatedly bandied about, but the whole concept is really a mishmash of psychological concepts that fits the authors pet views. This book has nothing to add to knowledge. It references the absurd, and leaves giant statements hanging.... like 'givens'. Avoid this book, unless you need source material about how not to write about something. Truly dreadful stuff....."
2,Zigville,This is pretty dated....it needs a good tune up. Pretty hard to read but maybe a good start for someone just making the move to success.
3,"See You At The Top, Zig Ziglar","Not the typical audio book I have come to expect from Zig Ziglar. This was more of a recorded performance than an audio book. A lot of time spent with narrative fillers that were not necessary.Message was there as Ziglar often presents however, you have to listen for it.A trip to the library for this ""book"" would be worth your time. Not a $15.00 purchase."
4,No one like Zig,"Love Zig! but not my favorite of his. I could tell he was younger in this series, but he's still great motivator."
2,What are you people thinking?!,"I think the only reason this is given such high reviews is owing to the fact that it is such a great play. The performances here are frankly mediocre, and Wallace Shawn is just not that good in the role. Vanya is in the middle of a nervous breakdown and Shawn plays him tired and resigned. PLEASE see the BBC Chekhov collection with Kenny Jones as Vanya to see what this really could be. PLEASE. At least for an English version; curiously, there is no Russian version of this anywhere on DVD."
1,"sorry, fail to sit thru the whole 9 yards","the casts are all good but i couldn't stand the endless blah,blah,blah. maybe it's good but i simply fail to find this bore-to-death movie the least interesting. if i were in the theatre, i might have to apologize to the other audience when i bailed out of the aisle in the middle of the big nowhere."
1,Skip This Edition! Nice Cover Art,"This edition of the Chesterton classic, The Everlasting Man, has been so poorly proof-read that it has unintelligible passages, omissions, misspellings--often several on a single page. Chesterton never used the word ""modem"", but it appears over and over. Punctuation has been reduced to the point that periodic sentences seem to be run-ons; commas and periods pop up is strange places. Is it sabotage? I CAN'T GIVE THIS AS A GIFT, AS I HAD PLANNED!""Without my old paperback (Image Books), I would find this incomprehensible."
1,Horrible Printing,The printing in this book is the smallest I have ever seen - almost unreadable. Also the book has hundreds of spelling mistakes. It seems every word that should start with 'h' starts with 'b'. How can this occur in the age of spell-checkers? Chesterton deserves better. This printing is absolute garbage. The producers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.
1,GREAT BOOK -- HORRIBLE PUBLISHER,"It is not possible to read this book because of many, many typographical errors and punctuation problems. READ THIS BOOK -- but get it somewhere else in a legible font with the actual words of the author. Amazon should not allow sales of this edition."
1,Rotten printing of a great book,"I loved this book when i read it a twenty or so years ago, despite G.K.'s tendancy to write five paragraphs as one. He is witty, clever and demolishes the secular approach to history. (Especially how the discovey of a thigh bone and part of a skull proves that this guy wore no clothes, had no religion, used these tools but not those, and so on.)But I am going to have to reorder this one in large print edition, not owning a microscope."
1,"Amazing book, but don't buy it from this publisher.","I love Chesterton's work. This is a great book. However, this particular version is riddled with typographical errors such as missing punctuation, misspelled words, and words that were simply transcribed incorrectly from the original, e.g. ""illogically"" appears when ""illogicality"" should appear.I have been reading this book with some friends in a sort of discussion group, and some of the others have versions from a different publisher in which none of these errors appear. I regret purchasing this version, and will probably end up ordering a different one. Chesterton is such a joy to read, and it is a shame to have to mentally correct typos while reading him."
3,Worth It If You Can Commit To It,"I'm only giving it three stars because I'm feeling curmudgeonly. It's his usual rapid-fire, turn-your-head-around thought, but it is not an easy introduction if you aren't already initiated into Chesterton's style.Still. His insights (in the first chapter) about evolution are so entertaining and sensible that it's worth the price of the book, and if both evolutionists and creationists would read it, it could put some of the fruitless antagonism between them to rest. They miss the main point. Chesterton always seems to point to the main point. Even if his positions are odd, he has a level head.If you're new to Chesterton, try ORTHODOXY first."
3,Wilder Publishing is horrid!,"Wilder publications ruined this classic. The 2008 Wilder edition of Chesterton's work is riddled with type-o's that leave you dumbfounded. Of course, my first inclination that something was amiss was the asinine disclaimer on the publication page, ""This book is a product of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today. Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race have changed before allowing them to read this classic work."" Yeah, ok.Avoid this one and go with the Ignatius Press copy. You'll be doing yourself a favor and perhaps sending a message to Wilder to get some better editors and give up the disclaimers (see their Constitution of the USA for another example of this 'service' they offer)."
2,A classic - in a poor edition,"I received mine copy today and will return it. It does not have Chesterton's Prefatory Note and the Introduction has been truncated from 10 pages (soft cover Doubleday) to three paragraphs! I started to read it and two pages in I found a typo. Also, I am not pleased with the quality of the print.The Everlasting Man is a classic and should be read by everyone. It is a shame that the quality of this edition is so mediocre."
1,"Good book, appalling publisher","Please read the other 1 star reviews. This book is quite good so far, but the editing is horrible. I will attempt to return it even though I am 1/4 of the way through and then find another copy to purchase. Words are frequently misspelled and punctuation is missing or misplaced. Wilder Publications appears to not be an entirely legitimate publisher which furthermore feels the need to add a legal disclaimer to Chesterton's text. This is the same publisher that was in the news recently for adding disclaimers to the American founding documents. If you needed further evidence that the publisher did not do its job, a portion of the introduction is entirely cut off. Do not buy this edition."
1,Low Quality Edition Full of Errors,"This edition must have been created by scanning an older one, and then neglecting to proofread the results. It is full of typos, omitted words and wrong words, which makes it very hard to read. The typesetting is also of very low quality, which also makes it hard to read. Amazon should really pay a little attention to the books they accept for sale. It would be nice to be able to assume that a book you find on Amazon meets some minimum standard."
2,Do Not Purchase the Wilder Edition,"G.K. Chesterton is one of my favorite authors, and this is one of my favorite books. But nothing is more frustrating than having to go through and edit the sentences for spelling and punctuation errors. The most glaring errors come in the form of random words inserted where they do not belong. Some words within it aren't even words at all.This publication is a disgrace to the intelligence and wit of G.K. Chesterton, and I'm sure if he was still around he would be quite displeased with this edition.I stopped reading after six pages, and will be purchasing the Ignatius Press edition as a replacement. Do not buy books from Wilder Publications."
1,"Chesterton's Everlasting Man, Wilder Publication 2008","Do not waste your money on this edition! Too many typos to count! I was unable to continue reading this edition, I have ordered the Oxford City Press edition. How can anyone with any morals, or ethics, offer such a poor quality book for sale to retailers?"
3,Book was good,"The book is good so far. However the Kindle version has quite a few typos such as 'bad' instead of 'had', or 'be' instead of 'he'. It can get kind of annoying."
2,Great Book - Dreadful printing,"Chesterton's book is absolutely wonderful...but this printing is dreadful. The 2008 Wilder Publications version of this classic book is ABRIDGED (whether on purpose or by mistake I cannot tell) and contains typographical errors.Several pages of text are missing from the introduction to this book. In the first chapter I found a question mark taking the place of a letter in the middle of a word, several puctuation marks missing, run-on sentances that were not in the author's original work, and paragraphs tied together without breaks.I really want to continue to read this book but the careless editing has made this version too difficult to read.I intend to return this book and purchase the 2011 Complete and Unabridged version from different publisher (The complete and unabridged paperback is also available from Amazon)."
2,Beyond my comprehension,Chesterton was undoubtably a genius. I am certain that this book has great value and meaning but I found it beyond my ability to dig it out. The language is full of idoms and references from late nineteenth and early twentieth century England which I could not comprehend without tremendous effort. I gave up on it.
2,could not understand it,"I am a beginner Catholic! this book was very hard for me to read, as I did not understand it. I did not read very much of it. Thanks"
4,review of the kindle formatting,"The book is great, the kindle format is odd. There are some places where there isaspacelacking between two - five words, or places where there is a space right in the mid dle of a wo rd. there are. also spots where there. are random periods in the middle of a sentence. None of these things make a book impossible to read but they do slow you down or remove your focus from the content and place in on the formatting and that will lose you a star."
2,"Not the work, but the publishing!","Bottom line: Love the work, hate the editors and printers.This book (especially the first 30 pages) is rife with printing errors, misplaced punctuation, and phantom paragraphs. Who edited this book?!The work itself is truly brilliant. Evolutionary thought has come a long way from the theory of slow and rolling accent to punctuated equilibrium, but don't let the limited knowledge of science stop the argument. I think the brilliance of the work comes from the pure questioning of what science and the men of Chesterton's age are getting at. Chesterton is the gadfly."
1,Was this published in a basement?,"Don't get me wrong - it's a great book, but this edition is awful. It has amateur written all over it. There are far too many words per page. The font, line spacing, and margins are too small. This makes reading extremely tedious and annotations difficult. Second, there are an inexcusable number of typographical errors. Third, the page numbers are in the bottom center. Fourth, the cover is poorly designed. The front picture covers half the spine, and the font on the back blurb is disproportionately large."
2,poor publishing,"I love the work and writing, but this particular edition is rife with typos. I would recommend another publisher."
2,Review of this edition only,"Book appears to be based on a scan of a previous printing. There are many errors making it difficult to read. For example ""bad"" is substituted for ""had"" consistently. Sentences break and new paragraphs start without good reason. None of the original copyright info is included, this is a 2008 edition, which leads me to believe that it has expired."
2,"Great Writing, Horrible Layout","This book is excellent. I am a lover of Chesterton. However, if you want to read The Everlasting Man, this is not the edition to buy. The layout is horrible, as can even be seen by looking at the back cover, and the book must be a scan because the missing punctuation and the b's that are supposed to be h's and the other way around are horribly frequent."
3,"Deep, deep, deep","Chesterton, who was part of the group known as the Inklings (C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, among others), provides his apology for Christianity. Although some of his ideas are easy to grasp, much of the book is hard to get through and even incomprehendable at times. Perhaps this is because of the age of the book (it was published in the early 20th century) or maybe I should just read it when I am older?"
2,Disappointing,I was initially excited about this book.Hearing claims of wit and graceful apologetics. Sadly I was disappointed I actually wanted this book to be good. It seemed hard to follow and the points or arguments that were used were poor.They could've easily been refuted with other arguments that I didn't even agree with. I know that wasn't the main point of the book but honestly after reading it I'm not sure I know what that was anyway.
3,"Great book, horrid edition",Wilder Publications should be run out of town on a rail for producing such an inferior copy of such a superior work. Seven pages in and I've already lost count of the typos.
1,"Egregiously cheap, nasty, and overpriced edition of great book","This, the Wilder Publications edition of The Everlasting Man, is an egregiously cheap and nasty edition of a great book. It is printed on oversize pages with very narrow margins in an apparent effort to reduce printing costs to a minimum. Overall, the production quality is on a par with an instruction manual that might come with a no-name hair dryer or computer part from East Asia, or, actually my first thought was off-brand Dungeons & Dragons extension materials circa 1976. You will be much happier with the Ignatius Press edition for only $1.00 more, which is the one I would have gone for had it been easier to locate on Amazon. I plan to return this and get the Ignatius Press version instead, or possibly Volume 2 of the Collected Works."
2,good book/bad edition,"I picked up this ""Wilder"" 2008 edition because I was interested in Chesterton. The writing does not disappoint, but this edition does. Replete with typos and no helpful commentary, there must be better editions out there."
3,Typos,"This book is filled with typos. Most are easily discernable (e.g. modern becomes modem), but some cause the reader to stumble, need to pause and reread applying the word he thinks should be there (e.g. every he is be -- or is it the other way round?). Punctuation is similarly hosed up. It may be due to the original volume being scanned and (incorrectly) OCR'ed. Whatever the cause it is very unpleasant to have to deal with."
5,Almost!,"I just wish it were not an abridged version of the book! Intriguing, I wanted more detail in the audio version."
2,Just ok,"The book covers the subject matter very broadly, but lacks in-depth detail and practical applications. It could be more concise in sections (especially about the author)and more in-depth in usage, application, and research."
1,Oy!,"This is the second book I have decided to review. I have decided to do so inorder that others may avoid my mistake. The book is banal. It goes on and on, creating category after category of needless taxonomies. Nothing even slightly new or interesting. Additionally it suffer the problem of all ""internet"" books. It was hoplessly outdated by the ime it hit thw shelves. Someone exceptionaly tiresome wrote a phd thesis, invented jargon and then decided to turn it into a book."
5,Exceptional book,"Over the last five years I've read several web design and technology books but none compare to this exceptional publication. I am not one to voice my opinion often but this book certainly deserves it. To quote Mr. Jakob Nielsen,""B.J. Fogg has created an important new discipline, one that is of vital importance to everyone....""In my opinion, no serious designer should be without this book."
5,Boys Just Love To Have Fun,"My boys love this game. Not only are they learning the fundamentals of the game, but they are learning the different players on their favorite team. When we heard that Gamecube was not making a 2007 version we were a little disappointed. Once we received the game, all of that disappointed went away. My boys are enjoying it tremendously and their father is enjoying teaching them about the game."
5,I am learning to crochet,"I have watch countless You Tube and Expert Village video's and after the initial chain stitch I was still lost. I purchased this DVD but was very sceptical that it would teach me. I thought I just had too left hands. It is amazing, I am learning to crochet. I am still practicing just on a single stitch but I am doing it! My goal is to make the beaitiful belt in the video and to make some dishcloths to drive my DH crazy (he hates the hand crochet ones that my friend made me). If I could give this DVD 10 stars I would. I also love the left handed screen on the side. When I have mastered the stitches I plan to teach my 11 year old DD with this DVD. She is a lefty and I am sure this DVD will be very helpful to her too."
5,I Can't Believe I'm Crocething is Awesome!,"The title says it all! I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting in Motion makes it so easy to learn even if you've never touched a crochet hook in your life. There's a Troubleshooting Guide, which helps you get past common beginner mistakes and Melissa Leapman's expert advice doesn't miss a single detail. The Auto-Pause was so helpful and allowed me to finish each step at my own pace. I had so much fun learning to make a purse and now all my friends want me to make them one too! Sit down and watch this DVD; you'll be crocheting like a pro in no time!"
5,it works,This DVD is something I have been looking for years! I love it I am a beginner and I feel that I have learned a lot with this DVD. It's great because I can learn in the privacy of my own home on my own time and not have to go to a class. I hope they make more of these!!
5,Fantastic DVD to learn to crochet!,I was trying to learn and make things from crocheting books but would inevitably give up in complete frustration. I purchased this DVD and what a difference!!! I've already made the barrel bag and fingerless gloves from the DVD and have actually been able to follow one of my book patterns for making slippers. My confidence is up 100% and I've crocheted so much now that my hands hurt. I would highly recommend this DVD to someone who wants to learn or expand their crocheting skills. Love it!
5,Finally bought it,"After checking this out from the library several times I bought it. I still watch it all the time. I love the pattern she uses in it for a purse. I watch it over and over again because crocheting in the round it a tough one for me. But, the pace of the teaching and all is great. I recommend it for new crochet-ers."
3,Difficult to navigate,"The classes are good, but the DVD format is bad.Once you are in a section, you cannot go to another. For instance, while doing a project, I could not go through a menu to a lesson to refresh my memory. I was very disappointed, because in order to see the main menu I had to remove the CD and start from the beginning to see all the chapters.I bought the ""The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting,"" by Nici McNally, at the same time as I bought ""I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting,"" and the difference between the two DVDs is like night and day. Navigating in the knitting video is a breeze, while navigating in the crocheting video is very time-consuming.The crocheting presenter, Melissa Leapman, doesn't look too happy about what she is doing. She is probably mad because someone made her wear those ill-fitting crochet sweaters. A smile once in a while never hurts!"
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"Very in depth instruction on crocheting! I'm very pleased with this DVD! I already know the basics (how to make a chain), but after that I'm lost. I've tried looking at books, but I need to physically see someone doing the stitches. My grandmother and mother are pros when it comes to crocheting, however, they work too fast for me to really see how they're making the stitches. Now that I have this DVD, I can roll with them! Highly recommended!!"
3,"It's alright, if you can keep up","The instruction is thorough, but the instructor goes too fast. The camera work is not great; it's almost as though the camera is too close to the instructors hands, and sometimes her hands were not completely in the frame to watch how to do the stitches.I agree with the person who said this DVD is not easy to navigate.I gave this DVD 3 stars because I was still able to learn crochet, however, I think it could have been much, much better."
5,A lot of fun,"I love crocheting, I learned so much watching with my big sister. I can't Believe I'm crocheting and crafty fun are my most favorite DVDS."
4,crocheting,I thought this DVD was very good if you have never crocheted. They give you everything you need to know for all the basic stiches. If you have your Stiches then get the next one. But I did learn a few things with it.It also give you time after the Melissa does it first and the DVD stops and give you time to do it. You can start and stop this DVD.
5,Good Music,"These guys are pretty good.Saw them play and they are even better live. This album is a good one to get, good songs with catchy melodies, and hard pounding rock. If you ever get the chance, check Panik out live. Definitly buy this disk. www.panikweb.com"
1,"Oh, The Horror","Anyone who thinks the point of Christianity or Judaism, or any genuine spiritual path, is the acquisition of money is practicing idolatry. Anyone who publishes a book about it is simply profiting off that idolatry, which in my reading of spiritual history is truly the world's oldest profession.The other ""oldest profession"" is a far more honorable line of work."
1,what a waste,"what a waste! very trite, rather like sitting in a freshman education college classroom! seems like after 40 years we could have something ""real world"" schoolwise, to think about from h.k. his earlier books were much more insightful and had greater depth. in fact, i bought this book on the authors ""name"" alone....i will never do that again!!!"
4,Great Sea Story,"Master and Commander is a fine movie for fans of sea stories in general as well as fans of Patrick O' Brien's books. The movie draws from several of the books, but remains pretty faithful to the stories. The dialog is a little difficult to follow until you get used to it. Now go and read the books!!"
4,Real movie making marked by characters,"It's great characterization that make great stories and this film is a great story well told. The major character - His Majesty's Ship - is a creature who we meet at night as Russell Boyd's brilliant camera glides over and through her. We immediately are conscious of claustrophobic innards, her movement, and the complexity of her makeup manifest by the hundreds of ropes, knots, stays, that encase her, thread through her. We get a fish eye view as she weighs anchor. We listen to her groans, creaks,sighs - literally a breathing thing.Much of the joy of the novels is the attention to detail which give the works an authenticity - Peter Weir has achieved a similar success in his attention to detail. A brilliant journey. Oh yes, the actors are fine. The story exciting. The ""special effects"" believable."
5,Master and Commander,"Well written, one got the feeling of life onboard a frigate of the 18th century. fine lead acting by Russell Crowe, with solid turns form supporting cast. Action scenes well staged. An Excellent way to spend two hours."
3,"Eh, it's okay.","It's exactly what you'd expect, and nothing more. Cannons, waves, old ships, swords etc. Great sound, picture quality, and a fun story, but it's not going to ""change"" your world. A low price makes it an easy buy though."
2,Pretty boats,"I really, really, really wanted to like this movie. Not only did it get great reviews, but it is set on a wooden square rigger. The golden age of sail! There were all these stories about how Peter Weir did all this research to really get the authenticity. Wow! I thought. Well, all that doesn't amount to squat if you don't have a story or characters that are interesting. And what about a cohesive timeline? One day they are off the coast of brazil, then next in the cape, having the same conversation! Who was it that died overboard when poor Crowe had to cut the mast off? It took a few minutes to figure out what was happening every new scene. Those boats are pretty though . . .Rent Horatio Hornblower instead."
2,Master and commander- movie reminds me of...,"This is Exactly like Moby Dick. only the difference is they are chasing after a ship and not a whale. hello, a big lacking in originality bit time.I was disappointed, like watching a movie for the second time.if you saw the most recent Moby Dick movie. Don't rent this unless you want a repeat of the same old same old.."
3,Confusing story and visuals,"While the movie does have some great special effects and cinematography, it tends to be very confusing as to what ship you are watching, who got blown up, etc. Toward the end of the movie there is so much action you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys easily. It's also difficult to understand much of the dialogue due to the thick british accents. There really isn't much of a story besides search out and destroy the enemy, so I left the movie not really caring if characters died (and some did) or if they survived."
4,"Good movie, with a few dull spots","When I say dull, I don't necessarily mean boring, but rather confusing or unnecessary. Not to spoil anything, but one fight in the movie is incredibly disorienting. I wasn't sure who was winning or, for the most part, what I was looking at. If not for this chaotic, sub-par fight sequence, the movie would have received five stars from me. True, a fight in a dark and dank ship would not be as clear and clear to watch as two knights on horses, but the way it was filmed took me out of the world of the film while I tried to make sense of what my eyes were telling me.The rest of the movie, however, is of the highest calibre. Russell Crowe turns in another wonderful performance as the captain, and the rest of the cast gives a wonderful feeling of being on a real ocean-going sea vessel.Watch out for the first character you see on film: don't let his size fool you, nobody in this movie is the size of a hobbit!"
2,O'Brian would gag!,"I have been an avid reader of the Aubrey-Maturin series.O'Brian was a purist and developed intense, believable characters. This film, unfortunately disappoints. The inane mis-casting of Russell Crowe, with his innapropriate Aussie drawl, is the biggest flaw. He in now way portrays the original character, either in stature or speech.The same can be said for Maturin, who is the ""raison d'etre"" for most of the missions undertaken by H.M.S. Surprise. If one wishes to see the fullness of this crime, read the series.I was soooo dismayed to see this in the theaters. The entire emphasis seems to be on the visual aspects of this work, which standing on their own are creditable, although lacking in many ways to show the immensity of the seafarer's world in Aubrey's time. I can only pray, that like ""Mutiny on The Bounty"", this great epoch will be revisited by artists with clearer intellect and vision. Sorry, but I can not recommend this juvenile epic in any regard."
3,Hornblower is much better,"The movie is okay, but doesn't hold a candle to A&E's Horatio Hornblower saga. If you really want excitement, interesting characters and great acting, go for Hornblower."
3,Wasted potential,"I like big screen movies and this a big screen movie. So many movies today could be seen on TV without detracting from the movie. So why go to the movies? You go to get an experience not available in your living room. Star Wars on TV is OK, but Star Wars on the big screen with Tie fighters coming at you is an experience. In this movie, when it does things right, you feel the waves crashing into you and the wind howling around you. You shudder as another cannon ball hits. The movie doesn't do this enough however. Too much time is spent on Russell Crowe without first investing us in his character. It should either be about Russell Crowe's character or about the sea and his ship. Given the potential to be a grand big screen movie, it should have been the latter. I came away disappointed because of wasted potential."
2,Disappointing Video Quality,"This review is for those of you who already know this is a great movie with a great soundtrack...but are considering upgrading from a DVD to this Blu Ray for an expected boost in video quality.Don't bother with this ""upgrade."" The video quality of this blu ray is no better than my DVD (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV). Very disappointing..."
1,seriously.,"brilliant special effects. worst. plot. ever. if you like huge circles with no conclusion AT ALL (it's seriously a huge circular plot that sucks) and not being entertained (as well as the use of the ""periscope shot"" at least 28 times), then this movie is for you. if you actually like good movies, then stay away from this."
1,Flotsam (seagoing trash),"This movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has read the books on which it claims to have been based, or who knows anything about 18th-19th century naval warfare before ironclads."
1,A pitiful display of directing and acting.,"This film was perchance one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of viewing. To begin with, the cinema at which I saw this film was filthy. Refuse and spilled drink were ubiquitous, rendering the floor sticky and thus completely abhorrent. The staff was terrible, and they all had a terrible attitude. Furthermore, the man who was selling the popcorn was a racist, and his relentless taunts will remain in my mind for the rest of my life. As for the film, it was quite enjoyable, and quite worthy of the Academy Award (TM) nomination it garnered. In summation, I would recommend this film to all those enjoy a film with a talented cast and wonderful direction; just don't see it at the Odeon in Leicester Square, London, UK, SW4."
4,Brilliant!,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is a breath-taking movie that will excite many who watch it. The battle-sequences this movie has to offer are very intense and the drama-sequences are excellent! The only problem I have with this movie is that there are not enough amazing battle-sequences in it. But, I will say that this movie has two breath-taking, and very intense, battle-sequences that really are stunning! Leave the battles aside, the movie does have some other breath-taking, top-of-the-line scenes in it that amazed me very much. ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", starring the phenomenal actor Russel Crowe, is a must-see-movie!"
4,Not Your Average Movie,"If you expect this movie to be a standard war picture or Hollywood version of life in another century you will be sadly disappointed. If, instead, you come to the film with an open mind and curiousity about what life aboard a British Navy ship in another century was like, you will be fascinated, amazed, apalled, overwhelmed, and a hundred other emotions space does not permit listing.I saw it after attempting to read the books and was blown away. The film is a wonderful adaptation of 2 of Patrick O'Brien's works. Oddly enough (and I'm not the only one to mention this) it is like coming in during the telling of a tale and leaving before the next installment. The film is a story within a story of life on the sea. Beautifully filmed, with wonderful actors. A good addition to the library."
4,DO NOT buy for the deleted scenes - Otherwise GREAT,"If, like me, you are considering the ""Special Edition,"" please know that the deleted scenes are not integrated with the rest of the movie, and are more like extra footage. Many are just topics with multiple clips on the subject, like ""Superstitions.""I am a big fan of the books and the movie, so it was worth the price for the other background material, but I was hoping for a longer movie.Overall, a truly great movie and a great DVD to own. If you haven't, read the books! Peter Weir truly captures the spirit of the whole series."
4,"Strong on cinematography, not on character development","The film presents an excellent and action-filled sea story, and it is beautifully filmed, but fans of the O'Brian series, who have become involved with the relationship between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, will go away unsatisfied. The film did not capture that relationship. Nor was Maturin well cast or developed. Russel Crowe did a creditable job of portraying one aspect of Aubrey, the competitive hunter and naval officer, though the character was a bit muted, possibly because the script did not provide for enough scope. The principal sin: The film tried to cover too much material in too little time. The result was a hurried and sometimes chaotic story line, and key elements lost."
3,Russell's Okay but the movie leaves much to be desired.,"Even with the acting by Russell Crowe this movie seems to go nowhere. It putters along with the climax coming and going with you waiting for something more. By the time the movie is over you're wondering ""what just happened."" For Crowe this certainly isn't a feather in his cap and they used his name to market an otherwise ho-hum flick. Maybe next time. Stick with Gladiator."
2,"Damaged case, DVD in questionable condition","The DVD plays fine, but the case won't hold the disk in the center anymore because the plastic broke. The DVD doesn't have deep scratches, but the light scratches on the surface make you wonder what happened to it."
1,Misrepresents Patrick O¿Brian's books,"This movie is supposed to be based on Patrick O&#65533;Brian's set of 20 books. The book ""Far Side of the World"" has the British ship pursue an American ship, not a French ship. So, why the switch? In the 20 set collection, most of the naval battles are between America and the British around 1810-1815. The books have very little to do with France.If this was purely a movie made up on the imagination of the people involved then I would say it is pretty good. But, honestly, can we allow the director/producer to distort a writer's work?"
1,An absolute bore,"I was extremely disapointed in this movie. It was soooooooo boring. It started off with a battle. Then it dragged on and on and ended in a battle. Plus, the ending was one of the worst I have ever seen."
2,"God, it was long...","Okay, now, in all fairness to this movie, I didn't watch the entire thing. I couldn't. I sat through the first several hours, and it was slow and tedious. I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was no action whatsoever. Five or six hours in, a pseudo-interesting thing happened involving a the cabin-boy, I think. That kept me watching for a while longer. But hour 10, I gave up. I realized nothing exciting was ever going to happen; and I'd grown to loathe all of the characters. I'd also grown a beard. It was looong.-SteveSteve5805@yahoo.comEdit: oh come on people, two people said this review wasn't helpful? I dared to say what no one else would: that this movie is long. And mundane. And dull. Well, I didn't say those other two things, but it was sort of implied."
1,THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING,all i have to say is anything you really want to see in this movie can be seen in the previews. thats how sad it was. my date and i both fell asleep. the first part is ok. from there its just downhill. not even rent worthy!
2,Completely Overrated,"Initially, I did not want to see this film, however, after seeing the trailer, I thought that there was enough action and adventure to keep the film interesting. I should have trusted my first instinct.As it turns out, all the action is in the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the two hours in between is as boring and vapid as any movie since The English Patient. I would have left this movie had I not been with friends (none of whom enjoyed the film either)."
1,Is it possible to rate it 0 stars??,"This has got to be one of the most overrated and boring films of all time. I went in expecting a movie that would deliver a good story about a naval battle and the such. I left the theater feeling ripped off. The movie spends a painfully long amount of time on useless and irrelevant little stories about so called ""Life on the sea"". This film shouldn't even be described as a Full length movie. It should be described as a very long documentary (read dull and slow) about naval life paired with a mini action short. The only thing that kept us from falling asleep during the film was the nicely done cinematography.IMO, don't waste your time and money."
1,dissapointing,"If you just want to see how the people lived, joked and dressed during napoleonic times, it's a good movie. If you want to watch an action movie, or a movie that has a line to follow and will keep you on the edge of your seat, look elsewhere. This is not the movie. It's more documentary type than anything else. Not worth the money to rent it!"
1,Worst movie of the year,"This movie should not have gotten the credit that it did. it may have had good art direction and costume designs but that does not make a good movie. Master and Commander was filled with a boaring plot, very few and very dull battle sequences, and scene after scene at the dinner table that make doing bifunctional equations seem interesting. Watching this movie was probably the worst thing I have done all year, including cutting off my own legs and beating myself with them.(...)"
1,A big fat wash up,"I was looking forward to Russell Crowes performance but this movie did him no justice. What should have tipped me off was the assanine box cover, however I was duped by the clever reviews mentioned thereon. Do not be mislead, this movie is as bad as the art work on the cover. Boring to the point of tears and fatigue I was literally exhausted after watching this movie and had to receive shock treatments to revive my will to live. Do yourselves a favor and stick to ""The Gladiator""."
1,and I thought Pearl Harbor was bad...,"I was hoping for a lot from this movie and it let me down on all counts. Theres no plot even though it covers several of the books. My father who read the whole series and has never disliked a movie in my memory said he got he best use of his $8 by walking out of the theater an hour in. Those who has read the books will appreciate a few glipses of favorite character but thats all you get. I love Russle Crow but he didnt get much of a chance to act, mainly because there absolutely NO PLOT. However, it is very beautiful, if you enjoy amazing shots of tall ships and ocean watch this movie, thats all there is in it. For me amazing shots of ships in a storm get a little old after an hour, but it just keeps going on, and on and on........"
4,Really good movie!,"4-stars overall, but it is easily one of the best directed movies of the year. It really did gather the tight spaced feel of a warship during the 1800's. The dialogue was annoying, so don't watch for the screenplay. But the set designs, the sound, the editing, and the acting are pretty good. I had some problems with the middle of the film which went a little slow (but so did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and that was IMO the best picture of 2000). But it picks up at the end with a great battle scene. This isn't a fast paced movie. It takes time to enjoy but its well worth it. 4-stars for the movie. 5-stars for director Peter Weir."
3,Lost Potential,"The best that can be said of this movie is that the special effects, realistic sea battles, and cinematography are fantastic. They really make the movie. Unfortunately, the story itself is rather plodding and does /not/ do Patrick O'Brain's novel justice. The plot is essentially a cat and mouse game between Captain Aubrey (British) and a French ship in 1805. There are subplots-such as leadership, bonding of the crew, superstition, and the brilliant seamanship of the Captain. The ship's doctor is a very interesting character-both caring, scientific minded, but aboard a warship. Unfortunately, none of these aspects are ever explored in enough depth to give take the movie to the next level. There was a lot of potential for storytelling squandered.Overall, I would rate the movie a 6 out of 10."
3,Extras disappointing,"Very quickly, I was disappointed that the special edition doesn't have any additional voice over commentary tracks. If I could do it over again, I'd save the money and get the simple version. The map and booklet aren't worth the extra money."
4,Rollicking good macho BS fun,"Russell Crowe is excellent as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, the head of the HMS Surprise. The movie details the skirmishes between the English Surprise and the French war ship, Acheron, set during the Napoleonic war. Captain Aubrey is a study in Leadership Values. He is a classic tragic figure, a hero with a fatal flaw. The revelation of the flaw is quite good but opposed to greek literature, Aubrey is finally triumphant not in overcoming his flaw but in that he is finally victorious (we believe) over the French ship. Oh well, I don't think it was intended to instruct us in higher moral values. Anyway, the movie is beautiful to look at, contains a dash of human interest (however, I did get a bit nervous about the lovely young men who served as midshipmen, etc), shows the comraderie that must have developed on such ships and from my 2004 perspective details daily life on board in an authentic manner. Recommended for a rousing good night of adventure."
4,This is based on one of the novels by author Patrick O'Brian,"This movie is based on one of the adventure novels in the Master and Commander series by author Patrick O'Brian. It is a tried and true story, one country (in this case a ship full of British~ (HMS Surprise) and another country (Napoleon's French forces), fighting over freedom. Although it is the same story, good vs. evil, you never get tired of the good guy kicking some butt. The crew of the Surprise takes a hit in the opening rounds, but comes back with a plan and some guts. Whether or not you like nautical movies, this movie, for sheer enjoyment, is worth the money for rental. Not a lot of battle scenes (only 3) or a lot of blood, gore, and guts, but an unexpected twist at the end, make it a great movie. If you want some decompression time, see this one. It will be worth it."
2,Such a disappointment,"After waiting, purchasing, and watching this movie I have no idea why it was granted the accolades it was. Peter Weir is a very good director but has little to work with as Crowe goes beyond character and tries to utter failure to not be a part of the movie but be the movie itself.In Weir movies often the landscape becomes a character in and of itself - think for instance of Picnic at Hanging Rock. However here he loses this advantage and opportunity. I know that the Hollywood money men make decisions to formula but keeping Weir from creating the landscape character of the ship and sea is really inexcusable.A universally poor cast and script lead this film into the depths of mediocrity which is such a shame."
2,Very boring ship movie,"This was a very boring movie, there wasn't much to keep you on the edge of your seat or to just keep you entertained. Russell Crowe saved this movie from me giving it 1 star. He is definetly one of the best actors out there and should get better movies to showcase his talent in. Without him this movie would have been even worse than it actually was. If you want to see a good ship movie check out Pirates of the Carribean. That is a very entertaining movie and I look forward to the second one. I very much hope there aren't any sequels to Master and Commander."
2,Defective DVD,"""Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World"" is a great movie. However, I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable. When looking at the readable side of the DVD after the movie froze part way through chapter 13, I could clearly see the defective area. It looked as though someone had spilled a bit of acid on that part of the DVD.Amazon.com's website instructed me to go to the manufacturer for replacement of manufacturer defects.The manufacturer, 20th Centry Fox, provided me with return instructions and I shipped the DVD and information to them on Oct. 30th 2006. I paid for the return shipping, and presumable there will be no other charges to get the replacement DVD.It is now Nov. 11th and I am still waiting for my replacement DVD."
2,A Tired Goose Chase,"This is a movie that threw away all the potential it had to be at least better than average. We are introduced to Captain Aubrey and his crew, who are chasing down a French ship and constantly being thwarted. And that's it. By about halfway through the movie, one wonders when this chase will get interesting, or if it will harken back to the good old days of pirate movies, ala Errol Flynn. It does neither. The characters are so bland that the names are even hard to recall.The movie's one redeeming quality, and why I gave it two stars instead of one, was the historical accuracy involved. We get a glimpse into the past that is neither overblown or trite. However, even a documentary needs interesting commentary."
2,"Well, it's lacking a bit","First of all, I will get my bias out of the way and say I haven't seen that many ""sea"" movies that I have liked. So when I saw this one, and came to realize that it is more about the relationship of two characters, Russel Crowe (Captain) and Paul Bettany (ship's surgeon,) then I realized I just did not like it. Now this one isn't a creative mental movie like Crowe's earlier part was in A Beautiful Mind, and it lacked the action in Gladiator. Those aspects gave the other movies the acclaim that they received. This one however leaves fighting as a tie-in to all the events going on in their busy personal lives, raise sail here, swab deck there. Give it a chance; because open-minded is better than close-minded, still I felt personally disappointed by the movie more than anything."
5,Master and Commander,"As a long time fan of Patrick O'Brian, I was hesitant about going to this film - I expected to be disappointed. I was wrong. The film captures the feeling of the book perfectly - so much so that I wonder if someone not familiar with the books would ""get it"". There were many little things that I know would be missed without the books - Killick's toasted cheese, the signifigance of the music, for example. It is a beautiful, very well done film. Patrick O'Brian fans, Aubrey and Maturin fans, go see this movie!"
2,Master and Commander,"CThe biggest problem with this movie is ""Crowe"" he cannot act! The story is a little far fetched and not believable."
1,Travesty,"This movie is an insult to the author and the casting stinks...a hobbit for Coxswain, just WRONG! Either do the series, or don't...don't mash several books together and ruin it all."
1,Amazon reviewer,The novels written by Frank Tilsley and Frederick Marryat are much better. They are more realistic and have more substance. The novel written by Frank Tilsley was turned into a movie and Frederick marryat's should be.
1,enjoyable and exciting it's NOT,"Sorry fellas I gotta keep it real. This film is so incredibly boring it almost put me to sleep.(Like a sweet rocka bye-baby melody)Theres like zero action and like 2 scene changes, the ship and the little rock island. The one battle scene is a joke too. This is just a horrible attempt. I even had a hard time understanding the dialog. My mistake is that I bought it before I watched it, I wanted to like this movie so bad and I had high expectations for it. Thank God I was able to unload my copy for 6 bucks, I just wish I could have the time I wasted watching it back. I'd give it a quarter of a star if I could. Horrible! Too much talking and playing violins (Hee Haw !!!) This one sucks bad...Real Bad!!"
1,Fox is the pits,"even at a discounted price of 28 dollars - it feels like an enormous jip by Fox to assume blu-ray buyers would fork out that much for SO LITTLE - for the film... fine... but for so few supplements - that's highway robbery. Shame on you Fox, shame! 'Predator' was mentioned, but 'Commando' was omitted as being another lame attempt by Fox, 'Master and Commander' continues the trend."
2,ON THE GOOD SHIP LOLLIPOP,"About as much fun as playing with your toy boats in the bathtub. These 19th Century British military seamen seem better suited for Never-Never Land and a bottle of rum, given their ridiculous offensive war strategies of disguising the ship and building dummy ships to fool the enemy. I've had better ideas in 'Stratego'. There's a flogging, a tormented officer, an amputation, sentimental characters getting killed, and a good-hearted commander who will stop at nothing to destroy his Napoleonic archenemy. The only thing missing is a great white whale to smash the whole thing to smithereens. Given the current state of seafaring movies, if this were a ride at Disneyland, it would be the safe, innocuous Dumbo elephant ride."
3,Kill Bill? try Kill this move!!!,"I don't think this movie did any good at the box office - Why? because people don't like starting a conversation with - Hey would you wanna go see: Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World? It's a mouthful, and face it, that's some movies downfall. It's historically good, that's worth a nod, but other that that, I fell asleep in the first 30 mins. Face it, it's boring. I think Russel just wanted to do this flick to sport a new hair do; which looks really ""blecch""! I think he needs a [...] eye makeover after this flick to get his career back on track. I think he might have gotten the Bond role if it wasn't for this crap."
2,Wooooowwww! this movie sucked!,"I was hoping to sea an epic, sea adventure with loads of realistic violence. Instead, I got A freakin' 2 and a half hour long boring movie. The only action was at the beginning, and the end. The movie is a failed effort. WARNING: THIS MOVIE SUCKED, YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY BORED, SO IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FILM!"
5,Magnificent film- a must see,"A perfect example of how to make a film. Director Peter Weir has constructed one of the most spectacular sea-going tales to ever hit the screen. Russell Crowe stars as ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, the undaunted Captain of the HMS Surprise, a British battle vessell which is dogged at every turn by the French warship Acheron. Vowing to bring his antagonists to justice, the vengeful chase is on in this wonderfully exciting, if not rare adventure film. Every aspect of this gem is on target from start to finish: acting, dialouge, cinematography, music, special effects, all first class. A stunning achievment."
4,history is great,"I felt like I was part of the moive, and yes Russel Crow is great, but the best part was the music that made you feel as though you were part of history in fact you were, b/c you watched the movie in a theatre who knows in 70 years where you will be with technology....."
4,Good movie,This movie kept the entire family (ages 15 -68)sitting still through the entire move. We'd seen it at the theatre and bought it to see again (over and over again) at home.
3,A Rat'ling Good Yarn...Nevertheless,"I agree with critic Richard Leveson: Russell Crowe does a fine job as Jack Aubrey in ""Master and Commander,"" but Paul Bettany was miscast as the brilliant, quixotic, secretive, murderous Steven Maturin. Strange as it may seem, I believe ideal casting for the role would have been...Billy Crystal. Only those intimate with the novels may agree with that seemingly offbeat choice, but those who are, will, and the supremely versatile Crystal could have pulled it off.Also missing, of necessity given the plotting of the film, is the other--with Steven--most interesting character in the series: Diana Villiers. Dragging her, and perforce Jack's wife Sophie, into the film would change it fundamentally so having Villiers aboard is a wish beyond reality.Given those caveats, and from one who has read the entire Aubrey/Maturian series four times and written a book about it, I still applaud the movie as a good, exciting yarn, well told.Bo"
5,The Greatest sea-going movie I have EVER seen,"This movie is the Greatest sea-going movie I have EVER seen. For those of you who have seen pirates of the carribean and just want to stay with that, DO NOT. You don't know what your missing. This movie takes you into the life of a 1800's frigate (the HMS Suprise) and puts you in the center of the action, from the ornate poop deck and captais galley to the smelly disease ridden bilges. It is able to capture the boredom the crew would expirience between engagement, but the movie is far from boring. The action sequences are amazing, this movie does not need hollywood to spruce ot up, to put wild twist on it, or use overpowering graphics, unlike pirates of the carribean. It also sticks close to historicl fact too. WHat more cou ld you want in a movie? Awsome fight seens, great actors, good story, it has all of theese. THis movie is worth your money."
5,An absolute masterpiece!!,"One of the best high-seas films ever made since ""The Caine Mutiny."" And one of the best historical dramas ever. Just don't make the mistake in thinking that this is your typical good guy vs bad guy movie, or else you'll probably be bored to tears. If you want a movie that takes place on the seas but with the good guy / bad guy stuff, then stick with the Pirates of the Caribbean films.But if you want a compelling story about a crew of men who come together through trials of conflict and great peril (sans the lame computer special effects), then look no further! By the way, I also recommend the Patrick O'Brian novels that this film is based on. I think it's blasphemy that this film was nominated for 10 Oscars, but walked away empty-handed ('Return of the King' getting Best Picture instead of 'Master & Commander?' You've got to be kidding me!)."
5,I just don't care,Listen I watch a movie for the movie. I rarely if ever watch the extras. Nowadays everything is green screen or blue screen anyway. All you every really see is some guy on the extras disc sitting next to a computer talking about what he did to make the scene on the computer. I'm sorry but this is not that interesting. I'm sick of hearing people bitch about it and give good transfers on blu bad reviews because of this. This does not help someone purchase it. Is this really so important to you 1 star people for the Master and Commander blu-ray? There are better things to bitch about. And for this Peter character to compare Predator to other blu-rays. Come on dude the damn movie was made in the mid 80's you really think the thing is going to look good as a new release transfer. Get your head out of the clouds. Every one of the blu discs I have from Fox I'm happy with this one is no exception. As for this disc great picture and sound and a good movie to boot.
5,Worth the Price for the Extras,"This is one of my favorite movies in years. The ""trailers"" and ""making of"" extras on the second disk make this item worth the price."
4,Captures Napoleonic Naval Warfare,I found this film to be extremely well-done. Naval combat during the Napoleonic Wars was an extremely unpleasant and bloody business and this movie addresses this aspect. There was a lot of drama form the interaction of the crew and the circumstances in which they are placed. And the acting is excellent. This is a war film which is certainly worth watching.
4,"Good, but a little boring","This movie was very well made. The scenery was beautiful. Yet I feel at times that it dragged on and there wasn't as much action as you would think. Over all though, it was a good movie!"
3,Good film - the recreated ship is astounding,"The plot is not amazing, but I enjoyed imagining what it would be like to live on an old-tyme ship like Russell Crowe's character. The ship was completely recreated and sailed for its scenes. There are a couple very dramatic scenes of sea rescue a la Titanic, and interesting battle scenes. For the ladies out there: Crowe looks great in tight riding pants with his hair pulled into a long ponytail! A good movie, but not a favorite."
4,Deserved more Oscars!!,Russell was cheated by not even receiving a nomination for this film. I remember the exclaims heard from the crowd in the room the morning the nominations were annouced.Another fine Peter Weir film.The only thing we could have done without is the typical scenes of people becoming ill on a ship going through a storm. Unnecessary.
3,3 stars,"a boring movie. It is over 2 hours and 15 minutes and the action scenes are bland and confusing. I don't mind a long movie but this movie wasn't very interesting, so I don't like the length. The extras are good."
3,Didn't deserve 10 Academy Award nominations,"As much as I enjoy a Navy war epic, and appreciate the work that went into the accuracy of this account, I have to admit I found this movie to be otherwise unremarkable. It's a generic story about a man who is following his orders in the Navy and all the highs and pitfalls associated with his duties. Russell Crowe is a hottie, always has been, and made the movie even easier to sit through. I also like the interplay between the Captain and the Doctor, who basically acted as the Captain's conscience in the film. But we've seen this film before, with other titles. This was not in any way novel. As much as I enjoyed it, it is what it is: overrated."
3,Crowe is so cute with a pony tail,"An excellent performance by Russell Crowe, he's just too cute in that Pony Tail.If you like Russell you'll love this movie.If you would like to see an amazing recreation of a sea battle between old ships, this is a great flick for that as well.The way they have the ships though as far as the time it takes to sail around South America is a joke.One minute they're near the top of South America the next minute they're at the bottom and then within a short time they are in the Gallopagos Islands.A journey that would have taken a LONG TIME is treated as a short trip.I would have given it 3.5 stars since 3 is a bit low. But it's not 4 stars for sure, IMO.Crowe fans buy it"
3,Blu-ray disc was diasppointing,The audio was great and this is well filmed and acted picture but the video quality on the Blu-ray version was disappointing. Thumbs down on this transfer. I've seen movies over 20 years old look much better than this one. Lonesome Dove looks about 3x the resolution.
4,Not Patrick O'Brien but great naval movie,"Patrick O'Brien's 20 Aubrey/Maturin books are a marvellously intelligent, multi-layered, thoughtfully characterised ongoing story of life in Nelson's navy. Master and Commander is not Patrick O'Brien, Russell Crowe is not Jack Aubrey, and Paul Bettany is certainly no Stephen Maturin. Nevertheless, the film works wonderfully as a swashbuckling, authentic, engaging historical tale. The sound effects are brilliant, giving the feeling of actually being on the ship. The scenery is heaven and the story fast paced. A beaut film that I'll watch again and again."
2,Master and Commander,"I recenntly bought the above DVD. But cannot play it on my DVD player it says""Wrong Region Disc"" I would like to return the DVD, unfotunately I have discarded the package. Could you please advise me further? I want to mention that I have always had very good and prompt service.ThanksHarry Shaw"
2,"A movie about blond hair, mostly","A British warship in the Pacific is taken by surprise and pounded hard by a bigger, faster, better designed and better armed French warship during the Napoleonic wars.Nevertheless, the British give chase and we kinda know they will prevail because they are ... blond.This is confirmed by the few scenes where you actually get to see some Frenchmen. They are shaggy, dirty, grim, and, unfortunately for them, not blond.So everything makes sense.Entertaining, mostly of you are blond and not French."
2,Beautiful But Boring,"England is at war with France. Russell Crowe plays a sea captain chasing after an American-made French ship. Not throughout the entire movie was I made to feel like I had to chase the ship too. I never felt the obsession on the level I was intended to. First it was a Moby Dick movie, then it was something else, then back to Moby Dick again. I took a break 1/3 of the way through to come back in to one of the crew jumping off the ship to commit suicide. I would have jumped too if I were in this movie.If you like cinematography, it was absolutely gorgeous. But you might want to wait to rent. There are far too many other good movies releasing this time of year to see instead."
2,False Advertisement,"When I saw the previews of the movie, I expected to see action and adventure. This movie was boring and I found myself wanting to leave the theater. The beginning of the movie started of strong, but as the movie wore on, it began to lose its momentum. If you want to get an historical perspective on how it was to live at sea back then, then this movie is an A+, if you want action and adventure get The Last Samurai."
2,Very disappointed...,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie & I'm sad to say that I was very disappointed. I was expecting there to be tons of action but there wasn't hardly any. My husband who usually really enjoys these types of movies commented that the movie needed some more action. I was so bored & confused. The talk was boring & different. When people got hurt or died I didn't even know who the person was because you didn't get a chance to see & even when they would mention a name I'd already heard so many names that I just forgot who was who. I didn't laugh one time in this movie & I felt like the movie ended with so many questions still unanswered. I don't know if it was left open for a part 2 but I just didn't get the ending. In my opinion the movie could've been so much better & I don't really recommend it to anybody unless they are really into the ship battles in history.
2,its official - the french cant fight,"what a lopsided battle at the end. The master and commander himself, charging lead through a barrage of longbarreled shooters is able to stab and hack through all the Gauls with swords themselves - and kill every one of them! no backstabs since the little kids are handling the others with their sidearms and scabbards. Yep the english boys cant miss!the final score is britain - 20 dead france 100000000 dead. Well thats about all i noticed of the movie since the other two hours of it I was kinda zoned out due to noninterest."
4,"Top notch audio, video unimpressive and no extras","I really liked this movie in the theater and on dvd. Sound design and delivery is top notch on this blu-ray version. The video is somewhat of a disappointment to me. The video seems to lack the punch that I know blu-ray can deliver. Not much is offered in the extras department. Overall, I was expecting a little more than I received."
4,For God and Country,"The production values of this film are excellant and the script is first rate. The overall performance of the entire cast is also excellant. However, the viewer knows what is going to happan in this movie as soon as it starts. The good guys(the English) are going to win. The entire film is a trip to this end- the only mysteries being who of the not most major actors in this film are ""killed"" in the battles to come and how the British captain defeats a bigger, faster, and better armed French ship. This is not to make lite of this film, it is entertaining and interesting. Just how many times you will rewatch this film- the purchaser will have to decide."
5,Spectacular!!!,"Not being a Crowe fan, I was a little uneasy, but any concerns vanished in a flash of powder smoke. I was literally ""blown out of the water"" by this film. This is one of the most accurate depictions about the Royal Navy. While the story line dragged a bit, it more than made up for it with the battle scenes. Spectacular! This is NOT your typical Erroll Flynn Hollywood pirate rubbish!"
2,This movie doesn't know what it's trying to do.,"At one moment, this movie seems to be about a ship of war attempting to complete a mission. At another moment, it seems to be an ""expose"" of life on an 18th century vessel. At yet another moment, it seems to be a pretentious moral investigation into the balance of military vs. scientific priorities. Unfortunately, from trying to be so many things it never succeeds in fulfilling any one of them. Nor do the characters give us particularly much to care about them. The end result is a definitely underwhelming impact leaving one wondering why this film was made in the first place."
2,Any ole accent will do.,"First, are we supposed to be fooled that Russell Crowe's Australian accent was British? The only reason I'm giving this film two stars instead of one was because of the art direction and costumes. As for the rest, I've seen better on the History Channel. Lucky Jack's obsession parallels, Captain Ahab from Moby Dick, but less interesting. I wanted to like this film, but it just didn't engage me. Surprising enough, it probably would've been a pretty good book. Nah. Overall: watch at your own risk."
2,"Great sound effects, boring plot","Soundtrack was great; deep, rich bass and very active surround channels. Visually, the movie was average. The plot was slow moving, repetitive, and essentially anti-climatic. I watched it once then sold it to break even. Rent the movie first."
2,Don't Bother,"I kept waiting for this movie to get going and it never did. Just no tension at all. I guess I'm spoiled by the Horatio Hornblower series, which is much more exciting and a better tutorial of ship life in those days (Master and Commander got a lot wrong, but like Russell said, ""If you watch movies to learn history, you are wrong, Mate!""). There are 8 Hornblower espisodes (A&E) I know of and I have 6 of those in a boxed set. I presume you can order the other two on DVD, which are the most recent. All are feature-length, so in all, you get almost 16 hours at sea.Russell Crowe, whom I love, really did seem fat and slow, which is what all the previews showed but I blindly ignored. At least *rent* it first. Don't buy it without seeing it like I did."
2,Not memorable,"One measure is what I draw from a movie. For the life of me, I can remember little but Crow hanging from the riggings, powder smoke, some island research and wine drinking. That's it. No catchy phrases, no memorable scenes. Nothing.Its been probably eighteen months since I viewed the film. At the time I thought is was a bit dull. I served in the modern submarine navy and I think a film about the sub during even my time on board would have proven more interesting.Good production value, though."
3,"Good, but not great","If you want great, you must see the A&E miniseries ""Horatio Hornblower""...HH has better story lines, more intelligent action and more endearng characters."
4,A Big Adventure but 10 Oscar Nominations?,"This is definately one of the best films of 2003, however, did it deserve all of those nominations. They deserved a lot, but Best Picture it did not deserve the nomination. Movies like Cold Mountain were definately better than this, no matter how good this was. Russel Crowe did a great job. The effects were spectacular, and the art direction really was well. They kept to the look of the period, especially in the costumes and props. The movie was good but lead up to be better."
2,So Slow,"Having read some of the books, I was really excited to watch this movie. It just never could get going. There was so much dealing with the boat that the plot line never progressed, and had I not read the book, I wouldn't have known what was going on. I didn't even finish the movie, so maybe it got better after the first hour, but I'll never know."
2,Expect nothing and you may not be disappointed,"I walked out of this film with nothing, no sense of exhilaration (like one gets with good action sequences), no warmth, as with a great story that you just learned about, there were some good visuals, and the audio was strong (you felt a chill from the rain and wind from THX) - but that was by far the highlight.I laugh when I read the reviews from Big Name reviewers that say such great things about this film. I guess politics in Film reviewing is no different than any other politics - people will say what they need to when the perks / or $ is good enough. (Hell, if our President is doing it - why shouldn't a movie reviewer)."
1,where is the rest of it,"The movie was allright, nothing to get excited about.I often read while watching a movie. If a movie is good enough to really command my attention, I stop reading. This movie did not command my attention.The worst thing about it was that there was no ending. The movie just stopped in the middle of something. Im sorry I spent the money."
2,most disappointing of any Crowe film...........,"The story basically is Aubrey chasing around in the southern part of the hemisphere after a French man'o'war.....that is it...I found it (extremely)tedious and annoying.One of the most distracting part of it was the noise.The dialogue was often drowned in it.....Frankly I think Weir should have spent a bit more time on character development........If you think that this film is exciting, then you probably would love watching grass grow......."
1,Master and Commander: The Far Side of Russell Crowe's ego,"This is not very enjoyable, and I think the Oscars have been corrupt since Jerry McGuire won best picture. I know I'm in the minority, but the individuals set of films just rubs me the wrong way. I doubt the historical accuracy of the films, and do not enjoy the sense of self-importance and bravado. Want to be a leading man? Lose 30 pounds and get a haircut. I find Ben Affleck to be a better leading man, and I think he's a robot in a Daredevil costume. The day these folks re-make Deliverance with Russell Crowe as Ned Beatty, Ben Affleck as Burt Reynolds, Matt Damon as John Voigt, and Tom Cruise as Ronny Cox is the day they take some daring and bold roles. I think Norm McDonald and Artie Lang from the film Dirty Work would nicely reprise the part of the Hillbilly's that victimized Ned Beatty and John Voigt."
2,"Hot damn, summer in the city, people at night gettin' dirt and gritty","Okay, now, in all fairness to this movie, I didn't watch the entire thing. I couldn't. I sat through the first four hours, and it was slow and tedious. I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was no action or plot whatsoever. Five or six hours in, a pseudo-interesting thing happened. That kept me watching for a while longer. But hour ten, I gave up. I realized nothing exciting was ever going to happen; and I'd grown to loathe all of the characters. I'd also grown a beard. It was looong.-Steve[...]And don't say that this review wasn't helpful. I dared to say what no one else would: that this movie is long."
2,Waste of Money,I thought this movie was a piece of crap - the visuals were OK - but the story was dragging and boring as hell. You should definatly rent it not buy it so you can spit on the CD before you return it. - ruggedthug.com
1,Blu-Ray Review?,"Fox Blu-Rays are the worst on the market. Bare bones and picture quality is B.S. See Predator for picture Quality compared to other Blu-Ray releases, terrible. The Wild Bunch was made long before Predator and so was The Searchers and they look way better than Predator. B. Dent must not see too well."
3,Master & Commander was Disappointing,"""Master and Commander, the Far Side of the World"" was disappointing. Although it was above average fare for what Hollywood normally puts out, it would never match up to any of the Horatio Hornblower series episodes. Lots of action and special effects but lacking in believability and historical period authenticity. Altogether too much familiarity between officers and crew for a British Ship of the Line. I would recommend this film as well done for typical Hollywood, but I would stop there."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzz....,"This movie is so slow and boring it will put you to sleep or make you want to leave the room.I was not entertained by this movie at all.It was a chore to watch it.Reminded me off a movie that they would force you to watch in school.It was painfully long and dull.The plot was bad.The dialog boring.The only good thing about this was was the special effects and costumes.I Can't believe all the good reviews for this movie.Must be some dull and boring people,just like the movie."
1,Master and Commander,"I bought it because of the many high rating reviews, tried very hard to like it but in truth I found it too slow and in fact boring, a real waste (...)."
2,Disappointing!!,"Come on people how can you stand this movie. I have a cousing who hasn't ever seen more than 20 minutes of it because he falls asleep. It's not worth the time. theres no plot, no real purpose to the movie!"
4,Pretty good...,"Pretty good considering that this movie takes place 85% of the time on a ship. I thought they did a great job with the digital imaging and with the camera shots displaying the scope of the ships.More importantly, I feel that they did a wonderful job displaying the relationships between men during that time period. Obsession takes many forms for many different people."
5,One of the best movies ever,"Seldom do my husband & I agree on the subject matter of a movie, but we both agree that this is a classic. We know a little about the craft of movie-making (our grandson's field) we KNOW this movie is excellent, technically. Very pleased with the speed by which we received it."
4,Great but still lacks something,"Let me start off by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. Russel Crow takes his performance by the horns and prooves it by playing the violin. The opening action sequence was more realistic than most I have seen and the could never gain the upper hand. However, I was expecting more of an action flick than a plot filled movie that kept you interested. The previews showed it as a constant battle, but it was a struggle against nature that they showed. The movie was still very good, and the performances were delivered solidly. Watch it if you like movies."
4,Amazing battle scenes,"I've never read the books which this movie is based on so I can't say whether they are faithful, but I really enjoyed the movie. Russell Crowe plays Captain Aubrey, a British soldier in command of the HMS Surprise. They are sailing past Brazil looking for a French ship of privateers. The French ship is larger, faster, and has more guns. Her captain manages to sneak up on the British ship twice and Crowe and his crew are lucky to survive to get a third chance at them.The movie is a little too long and there are a couple of times when it gets off track onto things that don't really advance the story. But it does a great job of showing what is was like to serve in the navy in the early nineteenth century. The battle scenes are amazing. I'd love to know how they filmed them because they are so realistic you would swear the actors were having a real sea battle. This was a well written, acted and directed film."
5,"A Few, Polite Words on This Spectacular Film ...","... MASTER AND COMMANDER presents a far more realistic, meaningful, and interesting portrayal of life on the high seas than PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN. Spend your cinema time wisely, and invest a few hours with Russell Crowe and his maties in THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.'Nuff said."
4,Outstanding Movie - Overpriced VHS,"Amazon, what are you thinking? $34 for this video???! The 2-disc DVD Collector's set with many extras only costs $25.99. What's up with that? Cut the price in half and and make this excellent movie available at a more affordable (and reasonable) price!"
5,To conteract the bad reviews given by that English Guy,This movie was good and deserves a 4.5 but there are on 4 and 5 so I have to give it 5 (to counteract the bad reviews given by that Londoner) Otherwise I would give it a 4 becaue I saw it on my TV instead of in the theatre and the movie should really be seen in a theatre. I thought it was going to be a stupid blockbuster but It was really a entertaining well rounded film that I will recommend. (im pretty picky aout my movies)-snobby if you will.
5,Absolutely one of the best period pieces in years!,"My husband and I adored this movie so much, we immediately went out and bought the widescreen copy. It's is going to be a classic. The acting by all was superb, Crowe is outstanding in this, and Bettany as per usual plays a superb supporting character, that of the ship's medical officer, the outspoken friend of the captain, and a scientifically curious man along the lines of Darwin (who never gets the chance to explore as much as he likes). Normally, this would be a man's movie, just as there are so-called chick films, but I enjoyed this movie just as much as my husband did...and there isn't a single 'chick' in the film.Outstanding acting and directing. Should have won more awards than it did, but it was competing with Lord of the Rings and other great films. Funny though, Lord of the Rings will be a classic and so will this one, while the other winners from that year will be forgotten!Karen Sadler"
3,Good for beginners,"For somebody who wants to put SAPScript to his skill set, the book will give a very intuitive approach to how to use SAPScript. Unfortunately the book only covers the functionality available in the release 3.xx. I would have assumed that a book published in 1999 covers at least 4.0 which is available for more than a year now."
3,Very good for SAPscript beginners,"If you have no SAPscript knowledge it is a very good point to start, but nothing more. I like to learn more about exchanging information between ABAP program and SAPscript form (eg. Perform from SAPscript), tips and tricks, etc. Althought it has just a basic staff I like the way it is written - very clearly."
3,Contains only Volume 2,"I haven't read this volume yet, but wanted to leave a review to note that this is Volume 2, beginning with Chapter XXI. I don't see any reference on the site to Volume 1, so perhaps it is not available. Still, it would be better if this book's page more clearly described what the buyer is getting."
3,DEADLY SILENCE,"The ever lovely Nastassja Kinski is the foundation for this derivative thriller, short on thrills, long on windy conversations. But Kinski puts her all into it, and makes this ""Fatal Attraction"" in reverse entertaining. William Baldwin, looking more like Alec every day, plays a powerful executive who tricks Kinski into a one night stand while she is off an a vacation. Her husband (played by the sturdy Hart Bochner) is going through a funk due to the loss of his job and he has started drinking. When Kinski returns home, she finds out that Baldwin was a little more than just a one night stand. The movie meanders on with Kinski having various things happen to her due to Baldwin's influence, and the ending culminates in a showdown. Baldwin's fate however is disappointing considering what he did.Reminiscent of late night cable movies, SAY NOTHING offers nothing new, but Kinski shines again."
2,Disappointing!,"This is not a film of the story of Nicky Cruz acted out. It is a documentary interviewing Nicky and others for the most part. The worst aspect was that the sound was so poorly done that it was a major, major struggle to try to understand anything that was said. It is disappointing that the people who did this DVD did not make the effort to make a truly excellent product."
5,great book,I thought this book was great. I think anyone who has children need to read this book. It touched my heart dearly. I'm so greatful Nicky Cruz decided to write about his life. It made my faith in God stronger.
1,You get what you pay for,"These songs don't sound like they're being sung by original artists... sloppy sounding, cheap sounding as well. Sound quality is overall cheap and low. Worth far less than the price!"
1,This deserves no stars.,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Completly unscary, absurd, trite, and badly produced. The DVD has zero extras, not even english subtitles. Garbage."
2,BLESSED IS CURSED,"The Omen meets Rosemary's Baby in his sloppily written and poorly performed melodrama. Heather Graham and James Purefoy portray a young couple unable to conceive a child. They stumble upon a clinic that uses in vitro fertilization to help them along. Lo and behold, Heather is pregnant with twins and all seems right with the world. But of course, the clinic is merely a cover for a cloning operation headed by a sinister David Hemmings. The movie's script is so jumbled, however, that exactly what's being cloned is never truly clarified; why is another couple ceremoniously dispatched? Is the husband in on the scheme? Why did LORD OF THE RING's Andy Serkis sign on to play a somewhat maniacal cleric? It's like the scriptwriters didn't know where to take the movie, since it's all been done so many times before and so much better? A shame considering the talent involved."
2,"Be afraid, be VERY afraid........","...of the crappy screenplay, mediocre acting, and less than thrilling pacing. Thing is, it could have been a pretty decent flick if they'd paid attention to the details. Anyway, the music was well done and matched the melancholy autumn landscape perfectly, the only reason I gave it any stars."
5,Can't go wrong with good music!,This was a gift. The recipient said she loved it. Guess you can never go wrong with music for a gift.
5,LOVE this ALBUM!!!,"I have always loved PP&M but this album, made at a concert when they were older and more seasoned, is incredible! Such a good unusual mix of seasonal songs."
2,"Not the peter, Paul and Mary I expected","As an old fan of PP&M, I recently purchased one of the original albums (The Best of PP&M) and decided to get this album as well. The origianl sound track was so pure, their voices blending together with a clarity that is only PP&M. However, A Holiday Celebration is not the old PP&M. Time has taken its toll on their voices and the now PP&M are without the purity of tone that they had in their younger days. It was OK but not that top notch quality I love so much."
3,"Solid, interesting choices","It's definitely Peter, Paul and Mary with choices, such as Blowin' in the Wind, which I had not heard before on a Christmas album. The New York Chroal Society is there, but in the background, not overpowering the leads. Folk-oriented in style on many occasions."
2,Not what I expected,"It comes with a matching washbag and the cotton is soft, which is nice. What I don't like about this product is that the dots are actually printed on the fabric! It makes this product feel cheap and I most importatly I worry about my daughter getting any of the plastic print in her mouth as she puts EVERYTHING in her mouth. It also feels as if the print will come off after a few washes. I only used it once, and will not use it again."
4,"5 stars for being in print, 3 for staying the same","lex & yacc used to feed a starving market; people who really needed to know how to write a parser generator and possibly wanted a more general and automatable way to write a lexical analyzer. As one reviewer already noted, those readers were able to work through two or three times and let the information sink in.The book's been very, very successful. It also hasn't sought to repay the market by refining itself and becoming more accessible to readers. Forget that the principles behind these tools haven't changed; there are or could be fresh examples -- who needs help writing a curses-based, menu-driven interface anymore? The SQL parser example is a loooong source dump; a shorter example would help to focus on principles, and allow room for more liberal commenting.I far prefer this book over man pages, but the title could stand a refresh."
3,Incomplete,"Lex & Yacc are fairly complex topics and any assitance is greatly appreciated. And this book is a good introduction to these tools. However, many details are only mentioned in passing and others completely ignored. A 2nd edition, with a more extensive list of the Yacc options and information on bison would earn a well respected spot on my bookshelf."
5,The best out there,"A really good book...this is basically the only good tutorial/reference on purely yacc/lex topics. If I have one complaint it is that it should be a little longer, but otherwise it's great; it covers all the lex/yacc versions including flex and bison, has good examples as well as thorough explanations of key concepts. If you need to parse a complex file format or compile a language, this is basically required reading."
2,"ok, but there is a better LEX/YACC book","To keep it simple, the book ""Introduction to Compiler Construction in UNIX"" introduces and explains LEX/YACC far better than this book. It uses a more realistic example and shows the error handling in more detail. This book is ok for a quick intro, but for a 'real"" user, refer to the book I mentioned above."
4,This acts as a Helping hand for compiler developrs,Firstly there are not many books on Lex & Yacc.Unix programming by Kernighan & Pike providessome necessary information but it is not sufficientto write a complex parser or scanner. In these circumstancesthis book acts like a God given gift for compiler developers.The examples which introduce the tools are very good.But the theory behind these examples is not well explained.Probably NFA/DFA concepts add more strenght to thebook. Adding more and more concepts and exampleswill make this as a unique book in the Market.Many guys who desire jobs as compiler developersfollow this book. So some contemporary examples thatI expect from future editions of this book areA) Parsing a Gate level designB) A small simulator which simulates an analog/digital designC) An assembler etcD) Relational algebra tutor etc.Hope the authors can consider this request.
4,"Almost perfect - good sound, but pinches ears somewhat","For those that do not like to wear a headset that goes over the top of the head, this is a good choice. The band goes behind the head so that the headset does not ""clamp"" or put pressure on the head. Sound quality is good and the microphone puts out a strong signal. The only issue is that the band puts pressure on the front of the ears. I haven't been able to find a position to alleviate this. However, I still prefer this headset to over the top headband headsets."
5,Bargin,"While looking for a telephone headset I found the SW Bell S60210. It was so much less expensive than any other modle (with high ratings) that I believed there must be something wrong with it. There is not! While my headset will not last forever, it sounds great and the microphone allows the other party to hear clearly. I use this product in a home office, and have begun using it on my cell phone for personal calls. Often, the listening party comments on how good our connection is because they hear me so clearly.I have purchased several."
3,You get what you pay for,"I got this headset to save money, instead I wasted both time and money.The sound quality is cheap and hard to hear at times. the head phones cover BOTH ears and this can make hearing things around you more difficultI bought this so I could have my hands free while gaming or changing diapers, I never use it because it is cumbersome. the cord is so long I have to wrap it around the waist clip just to keep from getting caught on things. and having the phone in my pocket or on my belt causes me to bump buttons by accidentwhen I use it while gaming it works great as I don't have to move around much and I can keep my hands freenot a bad head set for 10 bucks, but I would have gladly paid for the 40 or 50 dollar models if I had known the faults of this one"
4,Southwestern Bell S60210 Behind-the-Head Headset,I use this in an area where I wear a hat. It's the only one that I use. I had one that was inadvertently broken. I purchesed 3 of them to be sure I always have a spare.
3,logans running!wow !look at him go!,this book is about this futueistic world where everyone gets a chip in thier hand as a baby and when they are like 35 or something that chip gets deactivated and they die.this keeps the population under control.well ol logan didnt dig this idea and takes a hike and big brother goes out after him.thats about what i remember other than the book was fantastic and the movie wasnt all that great.
5,"Look Behind You, Logan!","I picked up a copy of Logan's Run with this exact cover in Kidd's Bookstore in Cincinnati in November of 1969. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Logan is a policeman(of sorts)in this futuristic novel about over population. Each child when born has a ""rose"" implanted in the palm of the right hand. It is red in the beginning, but it changes colors throughout the individual's life. However, it turns black when you reach the age of twenty-one. At this point you are supposed to turn yourself in to the governemtn to be eliminated. Some don't; hence, they are called runners. Logan hunts them down and kills them. When Logan's turns black, he runs along with another runner. Reading this book was like riding a rollor coaster at top speed. I had a hard time putting it down, and I was genuinely saddened when the book ended and there wasn't anymore.I did get the feeling that the ending left room for a sequel."
3,Not as....,"Not as good as the new '92 version of Godzilla Vs. Mothra. Mothra, the original movie was better than this."
2,Who mastered this?,This DVD was mastered by a monkey. I thought there was something wrong with my player at first. Real bad digital artifacts makes the DVD look like terrible digital video art.
3,What's with the release date?,The thing says 12/31/2025?? I'll be OLD by then i heard it was 11/7/06 come up with the actual release date please
3,Mothra vs. Godzilla,The original Japanese widescreen verson print with English subtitles is great. The print has been cleaned up and restored. The American version is fullscreen and lacks the fine clean up. It's worth having just to own the Japanese version.
3,GOOD ENTRY IN THE SERIES BETTER TREATMENT FOR FILMS,"I have said this in my past reviews of the Godzilla series, I grew up on these films and I have fond memories of watching them, but they are very juvenile. Even the Japanese versions are juvenile.....Having said that, I wish that these films were cleaned up. The print here isn't bad, but looks like there is room for much improvement. The features are quite good and considering the age of the material it is nice to see some of this stuff. I think 3 stars for any of these Godzilla movies is fair.....5 stars? Come on this isn't ""Gone with the Wind"" Please(Big G fans)don't have a hissy fit. I'm not really bashing ""old radiation breath"" he is a part of my childhood. If the prints were cleaned up and the extras were longer I'd give the release 5 stars. As it is, it's a fun entry in a juvenile series."
4,Mothra vs. Godzilla the Toho Masters collection,Mothra vs. Godzilla Toho Masters collection is an excellent DVD. Well worth the price. The only disappointment was the print for the english-dubbed version. I was hoping they would have used a better one.
2,"An excellent Godzilla flick, but a lousy DVD","""Godzilla vs. Mothra"" is probably my all-time favorite Godzilla movie, mostly because it has better-than-average special effects and an ecological angle to the storyline--don't exploit the environment, or there will be dire consequences--that still resonates today.This DVD reissue, though, is woeful, especially in comparison to the Simitar DVD put out a few years ago. That DVD gave viewers the option of widescreen and fullscreen images, though it was light on extras. This reissue from Sony only offers the fullscreen version, and a scratchy print of it at that. And the extras? Nothing but a commercial for the ""destroy All Monsters"" video game.Go find a copy of the Simitar DVD instead and avoid this one unless, like me, you're fond of wasting money."
4,"Good movie, [inexpensive] transfer","This is one of the best of the early Godzilla movies, and as far as Godzilla movies go, its a 5 star. Unfortunately, the DVD is not really up to par. It is NOT in letterbox format, and some scenes appear to be cut short. It seems this disc was made as cheaply as possible to be little more than an advertisement for the new video game. This movie is a cherished childhood memory.Its a shame they couldn't do it right."
4,Mothra Vs Godzilla,"I like the fact that Toho is releasing all there older Monster movies in a new dvd case.I look forward to seeing more of the movies being released so I can add them to my collection. One thing I would have liked to have seen with the movies being redone is to have the audio done in 5.1 dolby sound, than the standard audio format that they were originally done in."
5,Godzilla's Finest Hour,"At long last American fans of Godzilla can affordably enjoy what many rate as their favorite Godzilla feature. This Sony/Toho Master Series release brings us both the classic AIP dubbed American release print titled Godzilla VS The Thing, and the original Japanese version Mosura Tai Gojira with english subtitles, for those who prefer authenticity. There are great extras including interviews and audio commentary by American Godzilla experts. It's priced irresistably at less than $20! I didn't wait on this one, and will always cherish it."
4,good deal,DVD arrived on time ~ no issues. Good quality and sound track is nice and clear. If you are a Godzilla fanatic ~ this is a must have!
5,Godzilla vs. Mothra,"My order was put in July 2,2012. it came before due date like express, couldn't wait. I am very pleased with."
4,The battle of the most famous monsters ever,"as compared to the american version, this godzilla should've been in that movie because that is the image of a true monster, not a fake one. The story was good and the ending was great."
1,A Kid's review,"Poor Godzilla. this is a very sad movie because Godzilla didn't win, only Mothra won -how sad- I thought watching Godzilla as he was tumbling down into the water. If you really love Godzilla then don't buy this movie, this movie is only for people who hate Godzilla."
4,Godzilla's most unusual fight in movies.,"Godzilla vs. Mothra is probably one of Godzilla's best face off movies. Even though the movie sounds kind of weird thinking of Godzilla battling a giant Moth is kind of stupid. There is a reason why Godzilla vs. Mothra is considered by many as one the greatest, this is the movie that established just how indestructible Godzilla really is to convectional weapons. The film also has what I call the Godzilla Theme when Godzilla makes his appearence in the film. When the film came out in America it was called Godzilla vs. The Thing. That has to be one the dumbest dubbed titles I have ever heard. Godzilla vs. Mothra is way better by a mile."
5,WOW!,"Classic Media does it again. If you are a Godzilla fan, buy this 4th film in the series(I hope they get the rights to King Kong vs. Godzilla). I've already pre-ordered the next two films because I've been that impressed with the bang up job Classic Media has done with this character. Bravo."
4,WIDESCREEN! All right!,"I've already reviewed this movie, so I'm not going to repeat all the wonderfully complimentary things I said verbatim. However, the addition of this Wide-Screen edition of the film is fantastic, since the original movie was shot in Toho-Scope and the letterboxed format really shows off Eiji Tsubaraya's SFX...their scope is positively epic at times. DO THE WIDESCREEN...it's worth it!"
2,WORST HEISEI Series Godzilla movie!,"The plot is bad.They steal from Raiders of the Lost Ark when getting the idol and only Battra,Mothra's evil twin,keeps this movie from bombing out completely.After you watch it once to know whats going on in the series so far you shouldn't watch it again.Horrible!"
3,"Godzilla and Mothra, 1992","The forth entry in the brilliant Heisei series, Godzilla vs. Mothra- The Battle for Earth, is a good movie, although it is a disapointment when compared with the excellent Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah. The monsters are really cool looking, escpecially Battra. Unfortunately, the monsters are in too little of it, and the dreadful human characters are incredibly annoying, with overly cheesy lines. The Cosmos are extremely irritating. When the monsters do appear though, their scenes are spectacular. Godzilla is brilliantly evil, and his underwater battle with Battra is the best scene in the film. Mothra is very cute, and will probably appeal to children. This was OK, but I think Toho could have produced a better movie."
2,Mothra and Godzilla fight in yet another badly dubbed film,This is basicly a remake of the 1964 classic. This is more high teck but the new Shobijin are really bad and ern't even twins and there is a really bad dub job. Thus this ends up not even coming close to the original's power.
3,"Nice recovery after the whole ""Kong"" incident.","Summary: Godzilla wages war against a giant moth and her offspring.Over all, a good movie with above average monster effects, music, and acting (for this kind of movie that is).Not to be confused with the later '90s version ""Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth"".Next is ""Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster""."
4,Good movie,"This movie was alright. I wasn't impressed though. The final fight was a little poor. I mean come on. What is so amazing about 2 little larveas spraying silk at Godzilla. Not impressive. And the little fairy chicks get annoying. Really annoying. But if you are a fan, get this one any way.Mothra starts out as an egg thingy, and when people are touring this egg, Godzilla awakes and he's mad. He storms Tokyo and Japan. The mothra awakes into 2 little worms and they spin Godzilla into this little cacoon. Too bad. I actually give this movie a 3 1/2."
3,A more child-friendly film.,"The fourth film of the Heisei series lacks the complexity and seriousness of the previous entries. It is, however, light-hearted fun that is extremely enjoyable.The spfx are excellent, except for Mothra who pales in comparison to Eiji Tsubaraya's classic creation. Battra looks good and is suitably mean and ill-tempered. The Big G is powerfully rendered and played with absolute believability by suitmation actor Ken Satsuma. Koichi Kawakita does excellent work throughout.. though his handling of the film's final battle does not compare well to Tsubaraya's work on the original G. vs Mothra.The plot, though heavy-handed, moves along quickly. The actors, including classic-era actor Akira Takarada, are uniformly engaging. Once again, Akira Ifukube contributes a perfect score.G. and Mothra may not be the best of the new G series but it is still a very good sci-fi film for all ages."
4,Great... but not perfect,"Godzilla and Mothra return for the 90's in a film that has far more potential than it actually delivers. Don't get me wrong, the special effects are great, with the final fight in Yokohama rivaling that of Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II. The monsters look extremely cool, Godzilla looks better than ever and Mothra looks way better than in the 60's. It's just the insanely bad script and the annoying Cosmos faries that dampen the effect of the monster madness."
2,Elias and a cool evil monster turns good? WHAT THE @@#$#**!?,"This is one of the worst monster movies ever. Why? Because1. The plot's terrible.2. Those twin elias are soo anoying, you'd hope Godzilla kills them.3. Battra(dark Mothra) turns GOOD!4. Godzilla's the ""Bad Guy"".5. IT'S A RERUN OF GODZILLA VS. MOTHRA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Basicly, without Battra, I would give this movie a 1."
2,Godzilla DVD,"The DVD itself was OK (and the movie itself rates five stars), but the case was damaged. Be careful of this seller!"
2,"Given the DVD technology, why is this dubbed?","It's wonderful that this, the best of all the Godzilla films, can be seen in its full format in the crystal imagery of DVD. But, considering the audio channel and subtitling capability of DVD, its almost unforgivable that this move has been released with only a dubbed audio channel! The dubbing for all the Godzilla films robs you of your chance to fully enjoy the performances of some of Japan's best actors (Takarada, Fujuki, Sahara, and Tazaki) and gives the film an extra level of silliness that hurts it. Come on, this is DVD! Simitar must really be a cheap company if that can't muster up the energy to provide a Japanese language track and English subtitles."
3,Disappointing,This production was shortened too much. Songs and verses were left out. Although I did enjoy the music and voices. Just a shame not to have the operetta in its entirety.
3,Mikado Lite,"Worth the trip if only for Martyn Green's portrayal of Koko which, although vastly overdone, demonstrates why he has gone down in history as the greatest G&S player ever. Granville's Poohbah is equally fine within the limits of the character's opportunity. The ""prologue"" is useless, and elimination of significant numbers is inexcusable. If Schertzinger thought he could do it better in 90 minutes than G&S did in 120, then he should have written his own opera."
4,Pleasing Film,"Other reviewers indicate the viewpoint of those familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan. I am not. I do, however, remember with pleasure the light tenor voice of Kenny Baker on the Jack Benny and (later) Fred Allen radio programs. Occasionally, any of us can see him in the Marx Brothers at the Circus, as the singing circus owner or in one of the other numerous films he made in the thirties and early forties. To my regret, I did not get to see him on Broadway with Mary Martin but being given that role indicates professional respect for his abilities. He never reached stardom but always performed well in the light roles to which he was consigned.I can commend this film to the general viewer who seeks only a pleasant hour and a half of good 1938 technicolor and a lively score well sung. All the performers handle themselves well and the Marxian (Brothers) type of plot makes for appealing nonsense.All in all, a welcome diversion from the normal mass media fare these days."
3,"Some great moments, but disappointing","On the plus side: lovely colorful production (saw this on TV in the 1950s, but didn't know it had been photographed in color) and superb performance by Martyn Green (his movements are astounding!).However, this is a severely truncated version. Not only are ""I've Got A Little List"" and the hilarious ""There's Beauty In the Bellow of the Blast"" duet between Ko-Ko and Katisha cut, but many other numbers have been shortened. It's definitely `Mikado - lite.' Further, there is a long introduction that is simply pointless (which gives one verse of Yum-Yum's lovely second act ""The Sun Whose Rays Are All Ablaze"" to Nanki-Po for no apparent reason).This is a great tribute to Martyn Green, but some of his best moments were either not filmed or left on the cutting room floor. It that doesn't turn you on, then choose another Mikado (although all the other choices are sub-par for one reason or another)."
3,"""A Thing of Shreds and Patches""","This 1938 film of the incomparable operetta has two features which make it worth watching. First of all, the performances of Martyn Green and Sydney Granville from the D'Oyly Carte, though truncated, do G&S; proud. Also memorable is the astonishing color photography, an example of the possibilities the relatively new format held for cinematographers. Here the colors resemble the work of a manic artist set free after having been given a new, widely expanded box of paints. And the fairly lurid sets and costumes are a match for this photography. By comparison, those of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" I believe of the same year, look pale and tame.Otherwise, the production is mediocre at best. Extensive, often non-sensical cuts and other alterations of music and text render the effort a sort of maimed Cliffs' Notes version of the original work."
3,Kenny Baker--Simply Atrocious Miscasting,"I went into this with high hopes, as the Criterion Collection usually does more than justice to restorations of great older films.But I was terribly shocked by (1) the abbreviated version of the G & S score, cutting some of the best songs; and (2) the terrible miscasting of Kenny Baker as Nanki-Poo, who appears to have wandered in from another planet as an avatar of Perry Como. His voice is cloying, to the say least, and is a ""pop crooner"" voice totally unsuited to The Mikado. Compare, for isntance, Bonaventura Bottome in the English National Opera version (with Eric Idle). The fact that he speaks with an American accent and has a very American ""gee whiz"" manner throw off-key the whole movie.The main merits of the blu-ray are the beautiful high definition restoration of the original pastel costumes and sets, as well as the fine comic supporting turns by members of the D'Oyly Carte Company."
3,a review of the mikado,The costumes and scenery were good but the sound reproduction was bad in many places. I like the mikado but woud like a better version.
1,Extremely poorly produced: Worst quality of sound and video.,"If you need to throw away some money, this DVD is it. Quality of sound is horrible. Stage is a mixture of everything you can think of from all over the world, including Japan. Amazon.com needs to watch this DVD before they classify this DVD into their classical music category. I would put this one into a garbage section."
4,What would Willie and Artie think?,"While it is wonderful for its preservations of Martyn Green's KoKo and Sydney Granville's Pooh Bah, I find that the rearrangement of the scenes for this movie most odd. Once you get past the interpolated opening, it is quite enjoyable. But too much of the music is missing for my taste. Still it gets more respectful treatment than poor Lehar's Merry Widow did both from Maurice Chevalier and Lana Turner (!). Martyn Green in his autobiography states they were going to make The Yeomen of the Guard and changed their minds at the last minute. Probably beacuse they couldn't imagine Kenny Baker as Colonel Fairfax. Green thought it would have made the better film. I agree (if without Baker though - who's American accent just grates). Still an invaluable record of two great Savoyards, but I suspect strictly for the fans only."
3,Well done but missing important songs,"As a major fan of G&S; I was delighted to purchase a Mikado with Martyn Green. The music acting and singing are all good but, this prodution is missing 2 of the best (in my opinion) songs. The 2 songs----""I have a little list"" --who ever heard of G&S; production without the patter song and""There is beauty in the bellow of the blast""--always a fun number.So---buyer beware. I was quite upset, as part of the fun of G&S; is knowing what songs are coming and anticipating them."
2,Not quite garbage but could've been much better,"Martyn Green was a great Savoyard whose Ko-Ko was famous and was the reason for the film. In that case, it's a shame some of Ko-Ko's best material was cut. One article I once read said that ""I've got a little list"" was omitted because people knew it so well. If that's true, then the producer was a major idiot. If anything, the film is worth seeing for even a bit of Green plus Kenny Baker. Baker's recordings are only of light popular music so having his bright tenor in something approaching classical is a treat. Too bad he didn't get to at least try his hand at Nemorino or Almaviva - on records."
3,Somewhat mixed bag,"Overall I enjoyed this. Without knowing quite what to expect, I liked most of the performances very much - they're pretty traditional Doyly Carte stuff - with the exception of Kenny Baker, who is woefully miscast. Nice crooner voice, but his very American accent and wooden acting made him totally out of place. Loved the over-the-top MGM-style sets and costumes. Gilbert and Sullivan lovers should know, however, that there are MANY cuts, both musical numbers and dialogue scenes. Some were welcome, but there were some I was disappointed in. If you've never seen the Mikado, this should not be your first pick."
4,Nostolgic but Nice,"I saw this movie as a young person in about 1940 and it was my first exposure to Gilbert & Sullivan. I enjoyed it so much that I have collected CD's etc. of them ever since. This is a short version of the full production with a number of the orignal songs eliminated, some important and some not. If you like Gilbert & Sullivan I recommend the D'Oyly version of the Mikado as the keeper but if you like nostolga with Kenny Baker, an early star of radio from the 30's, and some of the D'Oyly cast this is the one that I would pick."
4,Charming,"The setting, manners and characters make this a charming and entertaining read, and the mystery is involving enough, if not strikingly original."
2,Silliness and Coincidences,"As an audio book, this is a great production. As a mystery, this was a disappointment. How convenient that people stumble onto critical clues, characters and evidence. It's as if all of England were no more than four acres large. I am still wondering what the motive of the killer was; the ending was abrubt and nonsensical. Please read ""A Daughter of Time"" if you want to experience Tey's best work."
3,A Tey To Remember,"Brief and gentlemanly, Tey's 'Shilling' comes in the middle of the pack of Tey offerings. She's enjoying something of a rennaisance these days--most of her novels seem ahead of their time, and one can't help but picture a youthful PD James consuming them, with visions of a future Dalgleish in her head. If you enjoy leisurely mysteries with much more class than pace, you'll enjoy Tey."
4,Testamentary Bequest,"There is a dead body. Where is her car? Why is she swimming alone? It seems her body is expensively cared for. A young man appears on the scene, weeping. It seems that he had taken her car.The name of the drowned woman is Christine Clay. Inspector Alan Grant of Scotland Yard is called to the scene by a worried constabulary. The young man, Robin Stannaway or Robert Tisdall, the name had been changed to Tisdall to please a relative, stayed with Chris. She had picked him up when hitchhiking, saying that she was alone. The boy clearly has charm. Grant and others determine that it is probable murder.The book suffers from having the most likeable characters mainly off-stage or dead. In other respects, of course, it is wonderful, given that Josephine Tey was one of the best people writing in the genre."
5,maybe i'm crazy ...,"... but i've loved oasis since day 1, i LOVE the first 2 records, think ""be here now"" is spotty but brilliant at times, HATE ""heathen chemistry"", but i actually think THIS is their BEST ALBUM OVERALL .... am i the ONLY ONE who feels this way? i swear: nothing could match the swagger of ""maybe"" and ""morning glory"" (and for me personally the joy of doing lines off those CD cases as a young freak while i listened to em!), but sh*t this record has some - a LOT of - killer tunes, and is a REAL progression forward, unlike ""heathen"" which, despite the presence of one of the 2 geniuses of overlooked but fantastic shoegazers RIDE in attendance, kinda SUCKS?!?!? well that's just my opinion ..."
4,FxxxING IN THE BUSHES,"It's a great Album. They improved noticeably from Be Here Now. Fxxxing in the bushes, Go let it out, put yer money..., I can see a liar, Little James, are all superb. I like who feels love even they are going to say that they copied George Harrison. The others are fair, but not as good."
2,VERY VERY UNINSPIRED!!!,"I like the first 2 oasis albuns...but this one in my opinion is the WORST of all oasis albuns...man, there's not really a great track...Besides, this is the album that really takes the attention of the audience from oasis..."
3,A Near Miss,"After the hoopla of the first two Oasis albums, the bewildering misery of ""Be Here Now"" and the anxious wrath of the NME, The Gallagher Brothers were bound to stumble. While not a classic, STOSOG still possesses some great songs. ""Where Did it All Go Wrong"" and ""Go Let it Out"" are two of my favourite tracks."
3,They Still Haven't Recaptured The Magic,"Although this album is more sesitive and has a cleaner production than BE HERE NOW, the songs just don't carry the power and emotion of earlier ones like ""Live Forever,"" ""Slide Away,"" ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", ""Some Might Say,"" and ""Stand By Me."" Liam sings in a more delicate manner now, and the band's focus appears to be less on creating big rock anthems like on previous works. I began to miss some of those loud and distorted guitars that signified Oasis's brash attitude, but SOTSOG does have beauty with its light and more mature tone. The songs Noel sings are impressive, especially ""Where Did It All Go Wrong?"", and hopefully he may take on more of the vocal duties in the future. My CD contained a bonus import disc containing the b-side ""Let's All Make Believe,"" and I found this song to be better than about half of SOTSOG. This is not Oasis's best work, but it will satisfy true fans."
4,rewards repeated listens,"Okay, so I know people are free to like and dislike what they choose. But I get the feeling some reviewers listened to SOTSOG, realised it was not exactly like Oasis' earlier music, got mad and then decided to trash the new one. For my money, this new cd really gets better the more I listen to it. I hated 'Go Let It Out' the first few times I heard it, for example, but now I can't it out of my head: it's a fun, meaningless Oasis song, not unlike 'Supersonic.' And 'Sunday Morning Call' and 'Where Did It All Go Wrong' are among the best songs Noel has written. Give SOTSOG another shot and you'll most likely be happily surprised, with the exception of 'Little James' I suppose."
4,"Quite good but could do better ,know what i mean?","This albums a giant over albums from 1999/2000 period but an ant compared with definetly maybe and morning glory.I love this album for great tracks like Gas Panic,Roll It Over and Where did it all go wrong but I hate it for Little James,Go Let it out ican see a liar.The other tracks are quite good but it could have been better done."
4,A Decent Album,"Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants is a fairly good album, although certainly not the best Oasis material. Pick up this album if you are a fan of 70's style guitar rock. The good tracks on this album are: Go Let It Out, Who Feels Love?, Gas Panic, Where Did It All Go Wrong, and Roll It Over-my personal fave on the album. ""Standing..."" is a good album, but I know Oasis are capable of producing better material. Hopefully with the new band members, the next album will be one of their best. One great thing about this album is the fantastic cover photo and the great background art in the liner notes."
4,Better than Be Here Now but not as good as the other two.,Standing on the sholders of Giants is Oasis new Album and it finds the Gallager brothers in pretty gloomy mood. this said some tracks hint at past glories like the single Go Let It Out and Who Feels Love other tracks are pretty cold and moody but this album (30mins shorter than Be Here Now) is a tight impressive album that shows increasing maturity and direction something that was distinctly lacking from their last album and shows them back with the spark that made them the band of the 90s.
3,Buy this one last...,"Ok, do not buy this album as your introduction to the band. Get Morning Glory or Heathen Chemistry first. This album was recorded in the midst of turmoil in the band, and only the Gallaghers and Alan White came out the other side (White is now also gone). And it shows. But there are many strong points - The instrumental first track features some fantastic drumming and a guitar riff that is still stuck in my head. Go Let It Out is Noel's singalong genius coming out again, and I love it. The other highlights are Where Did It All Go Wrong and Gas Panic - GP in particular should go down as one of their all time bests. But as an album it feels somewhat average, and you know they can do so much better - they proved it, in fact, with Heathen Chemistry."
4,Not the best Oasis CD but great,"I like Stading on the Shoulder of Giants. It's the first CD with the new Oasis bandmates. It's probaly the worst of the albums that Oasis has put out. If your new to Oasis this wouldn't be the album I got first. I'd go get What's the story(Morning Glory). My favorite song on the cd is ""Go Let it Out."" It's a catchy tune and will get stuck in your head. I saw them do this one in concert and Liam's vocals on it are fantastic. I like Gas Panic and did like F***in the Bushes. This CD is a must for Oasis fans, but for somebody new go get Morning Glory."
4,Very good,"Standing On the Shoulder of Giants is a solid albulm from a great group. The best tracks are Gas Panic, Sunday Morning Call, and Roll It Over. The other tracks on the cd are all good too, with the exception of Who Feels Love.I personally enjoyed this cd, though i know a lot of people didn't. I hope that you will give this cd a chance."
4,"It could have been better, but it still rocks!","This album is not as good as Definitely Maybe, but this new album is their most challenging yet!"
4,Not bad,Pretty hard rockin album but definitely not their best. Seems like the band lost their focus a bit with the departures of several band members. I would recommend their first album for new listeners. Definitely Maybe is a classic.
3,Just A Band,"Well, Oasis always been a superlative band. Their first two records (Definitely Maybe And Morning Glory) were brilliant and brightfull pieces of classic rock in times of electronic sounds. Ok, Standing... is a 3-stars album for its lack of inspiration, but not lack of quality. Noel is a great musician and composer and he's still on studio with the band. Maybe this is a little creative crisis, but definitely it's not the end of the world. Calm down and listen Sunday Morning Call or the classic oasis-styled Go Let It Out."
3,Their worst album - but still worth buying,"This album just isn't as good as their first three. The best songs: ""Sunday Morning Call"", ""Go Let It Out"", and ""Where Did It All Go Wrong"". This album just doesn't flow - the songs simply aren't as good as on their previous CDs. Still, it is worth buying and is better than most music out there."
2,remind me--why do we like oasis again?,"""be here now"" and now this. how many more thoroughly ordinary oasis albums will we rush out and buy before we forget how good ""morning glory"" was? this is yet another oasis album that starts with a couple of catchy openers, then descends into samey, oasisey, beatlesy nothingness until you realize the cd stopped ten minutes ago. maybe if you don't buy this one, they'll try harder next time."
2,This schtick is getting tired!,"Well, it's bloody Oasis, innit? I'll give them points for at least playing guitar rock when the rest of the world has moved on to rap metal or teenybop, but there are only two good songs! Is this all they've come up with in the two and a half years since Be Here Now? And if ever there was a band that should NOT include their lyrics, it's these guys... I mean, Little James is cringe inducing. If you like Oasis, borrow it, tape the second and third songs, and go buy the new XTC record. The rest of these songs are rehashed, reheated stuff... the usual mid-tempo chuggers that never go anywhere, but go on way too long... sorry guys... this sounds totally bereft of inspiration..."
2,Worst Oasis Album,"I'm a big Oasis fan, but this album just falls flat. It only has ten tracks.. It opens with an instrumental (a rockin' one, at that).. and 3 of the remaining 9 songs are pretty horrible. These are ""Little James,"" the Doors rip off ""Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is"" and the lame ""I Can See A Liar (Sitting by the Fire).""The album has several highlights.. ""Go Let It Out,"" ""Where Did It All Go Wrong?"" and ""Roll It Over"" are worth the price of admission.This album isn't much of a band effort since 40% of the group left before the recording and Noel did most of it himself. Noel sings all but one of the album's b-sides and ruins some songs like ""Sunday Morning Call"" and the b-side ""Just Getting Older"" with bombastic choir backing vocals.. He almost ruins ""Roll It Over,"" but pulls it off.They pick it up a bit after that.. their next album only had two bad songs.. (the last two) and then ""Don't Believe the Truth"" was a total gem!"
4,Definitely worth it.,"This CD is definitely worth the money. It's not as good as Definitely Maybe or Morning Glory, but it is rather interesting. It is much better than Be Here Now, and, strangley enough, offers a new look at the sound of Oasis."
5,This CD Rocks!,"When I bought this CD, I was a little skeptical at first, but once I gave it a good listen, it really started growing on me. It is now the most played CD on my sterio. This CD shows that Oasis isn't a band that just does the same songs over and over again. This CD shows that they have progressed as a band, and are working with different types of music, but there still are some great rock tunes on here. For anybody who is shaky about getting this CD, just go buy it and you won't be dissapointed. The best song on this CD is definitely ""Gas Panic!"" The next Oasis CD will be even better with the new guys. Noel and the boys just keep getting better at what they are doing, and it really shows with this CD!"
3,BUY IT USED!,"As a huge Oasis fan who has been pining for a return to the Definitely Morning Glory days, I was HUGELY DISAPPOINTED. Not to say this is a bad record, but it's almost embarrassing compared to the first two monsters. Even Be Here Now had better anthem rock than this. ""Little James"" is at best a B-Side. ""Where did it all go wrong"" and ""Sunday Morning Call,"" both sung by Noel, are decent but are definitely sub par compared to ""Wonderwall"" ""Live Forever"" ""the Masterplan"" or even ""Don't Go Away."" Maybe this album just has to grow on you. I hope so."
5,Oasis is Back,"Oasis has done it agian with another great albumn, Liam's voice sounds great, The songs are great ""Roll it over"" and ""who feels love"" are the best trax, if u liked Whats the story morning glory, and all the other cds You definitly will like this, BUY IT"
4,OASIS IS INDEED AS GREAT AS THEY CLAIM TO BE,"This is another magnificent album by the boys from Manchester. Although, this cd does not have any clear cut singles or radio friendly edits like wonderwall and dont go away they still capture the essence of classic oasis. this album does not have any 1 song that totally stands out the way wonderwall did, however the only reason for that is that every song in its own way is amazingly excellent...viva oasis"
1,noise and blather,"What IS this??!! Effing in the bushes is what I would expect to hear on some William S. Burroughs/rock star of the moment project...tripe! The remainder of this record is formulaic and uninspired...it's no wonder that the rest of the band abandoned this project and the band so they could salvage their dignity. It's too bad, because I used to buy anything with Oasis' name on it whether I'd heard it or not. Those days are over, just as it seems the band's are."
5,This is their most original album to date.,"They sound like the Beatles...Blah, Blah, Blah. I don't know about you but the Beatles I listen to must sound very different than the Beatles you people listen to. So what! Radiohead sounds like U2 and so on, and so on. Gas Panic is the bomb. Everybody relax and give this album a chance. This album grows with every listen."
5,It Grows On You Don't It,"I first heard it and thought ""hhuuummmm just another Oasis album"", but the more i listen to it i understand the lyrics and you know that Noel has gone extreamly deep when writing these songs and personly i think that ""Roll It Over"" it his best work to date. Not too sure about Liams attempt at writing though but still it's listenable......A MUST buy for any oasis fan!"
3,better than expected,"After I read countless negative reviews of this album and suffered through the bombast of ""Be Here Now"", I was ready to give up on Oasis and not buy this CD at all. Typically, I gave in and bought it, despite my misgivings. To be truthful, I'm glad I did. The album is WAY better than ""Be Here Now"", and there are a few songs that echo the triumphs of ""Morning Glory"" era Oasis. It's not a great album and the lyrics are abysmal as always, but for a true Oasis fan, it's certainly a good album to own."
3,Worth Having-- A Pleasant Surprise,"""Be Here Now"" left me with such low expectations for Oasis that I believed ""What's the Story..."" was just a fluke. It took years before I was ready to take another chance w/ Oasis, and after listening to album tracks on line, I chose this album. I further minimized the risk of adding a stinker to my collection by buying used. Well what a shock. ""Shoulders..."" is actually damn good. It's got a very consistent sound-- sort of a heavy pop with big beat rhythm. Good songwriting, good sound effects and production, and great vocal melodies. Now I ""get"" Oasis. I always liked ""WTSMG"" but now I have respect for them and feel like I understand what keeps them going. I think classic rock stations in the US should be ashamed for not adding Oasis to their limited pantheon of artists."
2,Too much drugs,"I'm an Oasis fan from Spain (sorry for my horrible english), and I was really disappointed when I listened this album for the first time. There are 4 or 5 good songs (none of which are excellent) and that was not what I expected. I think the other 3 albums are great (even Be Here Now, which by the way is my favourite Oasis album) and they don't deserve to share discography with SITSOG. Hope Noel gets the message for the next time. Did you know this is the best-seller cd in the second-hand shops in London?"
4,"The 3rd best Oasis CD, maybe even 2nd","Wow burried in 293 reviews of Oasis' Standing CD, I'll say this is a GREAT album. Oasis had some awesome stuff, and this is among their top releases. If you have and like Morning Glory, Standing is a must have. I'd say 9 out of 10 songs are classics on here, the only bum in the lot is the stupid Little James (nobody cares about your kid Liam just stick to singing rock and roll). Some tracks are more classic than others, and the standouts are the incredible opener F'n in the Bushes, which leads into the classic-of-classics Let It Out. Gas Panic is possibly one of the coolest, most eerie tracks ever done by a rock band, and Where Did It All Go Wrong/Sunday Morning Call - that 2 track combo (it's kind of one big happy Noel fest really) - is Oasis at their finest. I also really like the Doors tribute Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth Is. Very good groove. Like I said, it's a 9 out of 10. A must for any Oasis fan, this is one of their peaks for sure."
3,Oasis in crisis PT. 1,Success had taken a huge toll on the band by the time this album came out in 2000. Personal problems were mounting during recording. I did not like this album when it first came out but now I am revisiting it. There are some good tunes here with a nice heavy vibe like Put Yer Money Where Yer Mouth Is.Oasis are done but what a ride. Worth getting this used at Amazon to round out your Oasis collection. We will miss Oasis. I appreciate them more now that they are gone and when I hear the rubbish on the radio. (Does anyone really like the crap at the Grammy's or what is on the charts in Rolling Stone? I thought not.)Long live Oasis. Long live Rock and Roll!
3,Just a little dissappointed,"Some catchy tunes. Some great lines. One of the best songs from the recording session was left off. Oasis shows some genius, occasionally."
1,When the ... don't work (or work too well),"Just [garbage]. They fail. This was Oasis' last chance - I won't ever bother listening to their lousy records again. This is so ineffably lame, so uninspired...why did they bother?Apart from some impressive production, there's next to nothing worth listening to here. There's some half-hearted attempts to clone ""Wonderwall"" which leave them sounding more like Chicago than the Beatles, and then of course there's Liam's songwriting debut, a touching (read: ...) ode to his ""Little James"" which blatantly steals from ""Beautiful Boy"" - ... (...).The rest is merely prog-rock dressed up as lamb - Supertramp for the year 2000. Keep up the hype, lads, because there's plainly precious little left in the art department."
2,Two Good Songs,"It breaks my heart when heavyweights fail to deliver. We had pinned our hopes on Noel and Liam. Indeed, I thought they might represent the most brilliant part of the future of rock and roll. But this is their worst album, with only two good songs, Go Let It Out and Who Feels Love. It's all the more heartbreaking that these two tracks are so fine, because it suggests what Oasis might have been. Maybe if their next album is good it can salvage their place in the pantheon. But we'd been literally aching for THIS one. Their output since the magnificent What's The Story now seems to prove that they can't consistently deliver. And that's the difference between artists of historic proportions, and those who had a good album or two."
2,Standing On The Shoulders of Giants,"A low point. Listening to this album, one can only pray they go back to drinking and drugging themselves to death - when they did they had a much better run at the compositions. You can really see they want to be the Beatles in this album... let's hope Yoko Ono will break them up."
3,They broke up........who cares,"If this album is an indication of the future of Oasis, then as far as I am concerned they can stay broke up. THis is their worst album ever, whcih is still better than other albums by other artists, but for die hard fans, this is a joke. THe songs are not very well written, and with the exception of a couple of tunes, could barely make it to a b-side compilation. I can not believe they ripped off the Doors on the tune 'Put Your Money Where Yer Mouth Is' so blatently, come on its bad enough with England's Beatles, now the USA's Doors, go write something original please......Fans nowadays are used to getting 12+ songs on a CD, and with only 10 this is a rippoff, come on who are they kidding. Buy this only if you love everything Oasis, if not stay away, stay far away.......the tunes that are pretty good are.......Go Let It Out!, Gas Panic! Where Did It All Go Wrong?"
2,Where's Liam?,"I'm a big Oasis fan. I was one of those few people who actually thought ""Be Here Now"" was brilliant, but this stinks. Only ""Go Let it Out"" even sounds like Oasis, the rest of the stuff is downright odd, and usually bad. Liam isn't even on 3 of the 10 songs, and, unfortunately, those are 3 that actually show some promise. But, without Liam, they sound flat and lifeless. If you want to hear just how bad a song Oasis can make, just listen to ""Little James"" it must be some sort of inside joke, beacuse it is truly horrible. Buy the single, but leave the album alone."
4,FINALLY! Mad Fer It Again!,"After 2 long years the self-proclaimed ""Greatest Band in the World"" is back. Oasis fans have been counting down to this date for months, and I'm happy to say the boys don't disappoint. While not an instant classic like Definitely Maybe or Morning Glory, SOTSOG is an improvement over the raucous and overproduced Be Here Now. Immediate standouts include ""Go Let it Out,"" ""Who Feels Love,"" ""Gas Panic,"" ""Sunday Morning Call"" and ""Roll it Over."" There are a few throwaway songs like ""Little James"" (Liam's first attempt at songwriting) and ""I Can See A Liar"" (an unremarkable rocker). The bonus track on the limited edition bonus CD ""Let's All Make Believe"" is excellent and really should have been included on the CD. The addition of this song makes the ""whole package"" worth your money. Overall, a back to basics/straightforward album that should make any Oasis fan happy."
3,Are you mad for it? Well just a little bit......,"With their 5th album, including the B side studded ""The Masterplan"", Oasis delivers just a little bit of what has made them one of the biggest rock acts in the world. Why they left off other songs such as ""Carry Us all"" and ""Solve my Mystery"" for drivel like ""Little James"" (sorry Liam)is beyond me. With FITB, an instrumental, and two songs sung by Noel, only 7 tracks are sung by Liam (?????) How their A&R guy ever let this one get released without a little more depth is beyond me. Still, Go let it out, Gas Panic, Who Feels Love?, Roll it over and I can see a liar give us just enough to be mad fer the next one due out in early 2002. After hearing the two new songs, The Hindu Times and Hung in a bad place, at the October anniversary shows, it would appear that the band is going to get back to a more straight ahead sound. Guys, more is better, so next time leave all the demos on the record and let us decide!!! Cheers!"
5,Change of style,"I'm an oasis fan. I have all their videos, singles (UK and US), and of course, albums. I noticed how their first three albums had a similair style. Their forth album breaks away from their BRit-popish style of riffs and drums, and truely presents an original line up of tracks that proves they have matured. Think of it this way: the beatles were thought of as the cute British pop rock stars when they became huge, but they eventually evolved in their style (remember Srgnt Pepper?). It's the same senario here."
4,Oasis is finally back!,"Oasis is probably one of my fave rock groups ever. I've been waiting for a long time for this album to come out since The Masterplan. SOTSOG is great! I think I got the explicit version (it has two red X's, not that sign). The songs are great. I don't understand why people don't like this disc. It's different than their other ones. They don't have that Beatles sound really anymore. Well, it's not as distinct. If you love Oasis as much as I do, go get it! You won't be disappointed!"
4,Oasis BACK after 2.5 years of waiting,"This album is obviously not the typical oasis I was used to. I knew this when I heard Go Let It Out and the B sides on that single. There is a lot of experimentation evident in here. But! I like this album a lot. It is a huge step up from Be Here Now, where every song sounded alike. When u listen to this CD u can definitely pick out the beatlesque tunes...but that's typical of Oasis. Personally I feel that the highlight of this album is song #7 Where did it all go wrong? sung brilliantly by Noel. Gas Panic and basically songs 2,5-10 are very good. Roll it over is a nice touch to end the band's 4th studio album. Buying this album is a must!"
2,Hmmmmmm.......,"Everyone knows that ""WTSMG"" is by far the greatest Oasis album and quite frankly, as we say in dear old Blighty, this is pants. Apart from the brilliant sneeriness of ""Go Let It Out"" (a UK no. 1) and a couple of others, this is even more of a disappointment than BHN. Anyway, to be totally objective,I quite like BHN after 3 years so maybe SOTSOG is a grower and, well, Oasis are after all the greatest Beatles tribute band ever so I can't diss them too much."
2,Thats Oasis? Are You Sure?,"If youre really really into them and you love Oasis, then maybe you should ask someone to buy this for you as a gift. Otherwise, youll be highly upset when you buy it and actually hear what youve spent your money on. Maybe I'm just still stuck on their first two (awesome) cd's. Maybe I need to evolve, maybe this cd sucks."
3,There are some good songs,This cd has some dissapointments but there are at least 4 good songs that I like and would like to listen to if I put the cd on. You can't try to compare it to Morning Glory because that was a masterpeice but it is pretty good. The bonus cd has maybe the best song of all.
3,Have what was once Britain's finest rock band had it?,"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants is an album which lacks what Oasis once were, and what they once stood for.There are some tracks which recapture some of the old magic of the definatley maybe and Whats the story days, but all in all its an average album.Go let it out is, I have to say the best track on the album with little James and Sunday morning call following closley behind.The tracks inbetween just don't have that spark to them which made Oasis what they should be today. You get the impression though, that Oasis are capable of much better so has the bubble finally burst for them? The answer could be not necessarily, this album is a great improvement on the dire 'Be here now'but still is no where near the first two.Perhaps now that particulary Liam has matured perhaps they are capable of going on to better things - only will fans be patient enough to find out?"
5,Misunderstood masterpiece.,"How one magazine review stated that this was the worst album of 2000 astounds me. It is not their best effort, but compared to 99% of the bands out there it is amazing. Great hooks, great song structures, and great singing. Please listen to this album for what it is, and I promise you will love it."
5,OASIS IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD,"I only need one word in this review BEST! This is the best album I have ever heard. I wanna shout this out to all my fellow americans: OASIS IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD. BUY THEIR RECORDS AND LISTEN TO NOTHING ELSE. If I was stranded on a desert island and all I had were my Oasis records and a boom box......I would be happy.... This cd rocks, and so does anything labeling the name....OASIS.. 10000stars"
4,Get off the bandwagon.,"Let the Oasis bashing stop right here. This album is so much better than Be Here Now I can't even begin to describe it. I dare say it's as good as What's the Story (Morning Glory). Bold statement, I know, but I believe it. Even the b-sides to the singles are great (especially Cigarettes in Hell). So don't listen to all the fools who say they're washed up, over, finished, etc. Buy this album right now. You won't regret it."
4,Go get this one,"This is a departure from the thrashing guitars of previous Oasis albums, but the band sounds more focused to deliver a tighter album, and they accomplish their task. Liam Gallagher even wrote one of the songs on the album. ""Go Let It Out"", ""Who Needs Love"", and ""Where Did It All Go Wrong"""
4,On their way to become giants,"Listening to SOTSOG for the first time one might ask what has happened to Oasis. After a couple of times you know the answer, they have matured. After Be Here Now this CD shows that Noel and Liam are capable of more than just copying Lennon/McCartney. But there is still room for improvement. The dear brothers should give some more serious attention to their lyrics. Not withstanding the lyrics this CD contains a number of great songs. If they continue to develop in this way they may become real giants in their field of business. But, they are still a long way from the Beatles."
3,"Where did it all go wrong, indeed.","Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (SOTSOG) is a further departure from what makes OASIS great. Noel continues to speak publicly about the need for bands to play their own material and remain authentic. Then why move further away from the guitar driven rifts and brashly optimistic lyrics that makes the band so special? SOTSOG overly relies on syntheticly produced backup, so much so that it would be hard to imagine Noel singing acoustic to more than a few tracks. On a positive note, Sunday Morning Call and the B-side Let's All Make Believe (it should have made the album!) are great standouts, with the overly lauded Gas Panic and Where did it All Go Wrong remaining solid efforts. Serious OASIS fans will feel compelled to buy this album (as I did on the day it came out) but I would be lying if I did not yearn for their early guitar driven days."
3,Who feels love?,"Just like to say how good 'Who feels love?' is. It seems like ages since my last favourite Oasis song, 'Do Know What I Mean?' was complemented. The background music and tambourine in 'Who feels love?' is great. Message to 'Where did it all go wrong' music fan in Australia, City's back in the big time. Blue Moon, you saw me..."
1,Freedom From Fundamentalism,"If you enjoy being deceived then you will like this book. The existence of Mary Ann Collins is questionable. No one that I can find has ever seen or met her. She refuses to give it any information about what convent she allegedly joined. I am a former fundamentalist preacher who is now a Catholic priest. I found freedom from fundamentalism in the ""pillar and foundation of truth"" that is the Catholic Church. You can too, see [...] the Catholic Answers page."
3,Interesting Movie,I purchased this DVD because I'm a Colin Firth fan and found this to be a very interesting movie directed by a very talented actress.
2,A punch in the stomach.,"Love all these actors. The story was interesting and flowing nicely. Felt a jab when Bette first said my Lord's name, but a real kick in the stomach toward the end of the movie when His name was mixed with a foul word. This should not be. I am offended. Hollywood should consider those of us who love and honor Jesus Christ."
3,An icon of its genre,"Be advised, this is a MAJOR chick flick. If, when my wife rented it, I had not been recovering from a recent severe knee injury that required extensive prescription med dosage, I would have found the film too indescribably painful to endure."
3,contrived,"These characters were mostly one dimensional and annoying. Helen Hunts' character was such a victim that I stopped caring about her, and Bet Midler as her mother?? really? I don't know if it was the script or the interpretation; it was watchable but the pieces didn't come together into anything satisfying."
2,ok,"predictable, but enteraining enough to continue to watch, and know what the ending will be. Part of my problem is, I am not a Helen Hunt fan, so for me, she is a distraction. does the woman ever smile, is not always in angst? Light mindless entertainment."
3,E,"This movie is good for a quiet evening. The acting is the best part. The story is OK. The scenes are well done for the story. The story is not especially strong unless you are one who is dealing with the issues of fertility, adoption, and divorce. The protagonist is believable and so is everyone else. Human foibles are sensitively presented but not excused. The ending gives one something to think about. All the characters pretty much get what they really want."
3,Its Ok,"Glad I did not pay for it, I would have been greatly dissappointed.I love Helen Hunt, but this was not a shinning roll."
1,what a waist of time,"Who would have thought, that with such a ""great"" list of actors & actresses that this movie would be so bad. The scrip must have been written by a foul mouthed teenager as it had no depth and no direction & every other word was a swear word. Do people really talk like that? Not were I live and thank goodness. YUK"
1,"No laughs,maybe one chuckle","I found this movie very sad and rather boring since I enjoy laughing.There were no laughs, even the actors had nothing to laugh about.I agree with some of the other reviews in that Bette Midler was the only spark ofentertainment in the whole movie.She was the only one worth watching.If I had the ""zero stars"" option, I would have clicked that."
1,Sad movie,"I think that it is very sad that Colin Firth will take up any role as long as he is paid for it. For me his 1994 movie ""The Playmaker"" is an example of that. Now I can add another movie ""Then she found me"" to this list. Dialogue is strained and not flowing too well. There is no fire between him and Helen Hunt. Even with tons of makeup on her face, she looks older than the supposed age of mid forties. If you do not believe me, look at the movie ratings, it has not been out for 2 weeks and its sales rating is above 200."
3,It's ok...,Helen Hunt is fine. Colin Firth is great. Matthew Broderick has no appeal and it makes no sense that Hunt's character could ever have been attracted to him. Not enough back story to show love or sex appeal.
2,Not romantic and not a comedy,"I'm not sure what to say about this movie. I was excited to see the star line up, but didn't particularly like any of the characters. I didn't mourn the end nor celebrate the beginning of any of the relationships. I was mostly puzzled and wondering why?"
2,Painstakingly boring.,"There are many movies that don't get made for a long time because people are afraid to take a financial risk on something different. There are other movies that maybe just shouldn't be made. This is the latter. I can't give it one star because it was well acted. The few people who recognize this title probably sought it out and are into a very niche sort of veiwer. They will like this because it is what it is. A bad Lifetime movie sort of offering but well acted and filmed. This movie just isn't compelling or funny or other. If Helen and the artists involved made it out of their own pocket and produced it as a labor of love, more power to them. They created what they were after and it is a work they can appreciate themselves. It doesn't matter what the world thinks."
3,"Loved The Script and The Actors, But One Thing Kept Me From Giving It 5 Stars","I absolutely love Colin Firth. Helen Hunt and Bette Midler are also favorites. The script in ""Then She Found Me"" was excellent. It kept me interested. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the language, which I found unnecessary to the story. It was just thrown in for shock value. The story didn't need it. It was good enough on its own."
3,Interesting but a bit dialog heavy,"A few of the bits were pretty good. It was a bit out of what I normally watch, but it was thought provoking. I didn't like the light that they put on Firth the man comes off as rather mean, and a bit lost, yet at the same time she revers him as almost saintly in her heart. His outbursts are a little more then what I would have liked to see in the ""hero"" of the movie, the struggles are fine, her struggle with her own heart, and her own feeling with adoption, which could lead to a good story, and well filmed movie. The timeline at the start felt rushed, the wedding, the cheating, the death, and then the miscarrage, and right in to trying to have a baby again. IDk it was an ok movie, not that I would watch it again though, just something that filled my day while trying to distract myself from work..."
3,It was ok,This movie was just 'OK'....I can understand both parts. I thought the role of Bette Middler would be difficult for anyone and was played well.
2,Watch if bored,"Story about a woman who was adopted at an infant age. Now an adult the desire to have her own kids is extreme enough to marry a ""man"" and get pregnant. Through the roller coaster of love, marriage, and relationship change up her biological mother tracks her down. Very predictable twist and turns."
2,"Great cast, but disappointing...","I chose this movie assuming that a good cast equals a quality film. Well, I was wrong. I found the movie choppy, unbelievable and poorly written/produced. Helen Hunt appears much older than age 39 and malnourished, but even that would have been tolerable if her character was truly believable and, in my opinion, authentically Jewish. I've enjoyed the actors in previous movies, but this movie, Then She Found Me, seemed to be thrown together without being constructively reviewed or edited. For me, it was excruciating to watch because I hoped at any moment there would be chemistry between the characters and a well produced movie. There were a few touching parts of this movie toward the very end, but those were overshadowed by the lack of consistency throughout."
3,Plausible Journey,"Loved Colin Firth. Broderick is, as one reviewer mentioned, rather flat. Helen Hunt is an exceptional actress, but I found her disturbingly thin in this movie. The gauntness with the psychological travails seemed overwhelming and her normal beautiful face cast in a life-disappointment frown most of the time. Bette Midler will always be the Goddess I hope to channel in myself. The journey is plausible. Humans often make the same mistakes over again until finally they get whatever lesson is there for them which pops them out of the loop. It all works out in a way that makes sense, but I'm left with this thin, sad, image of Helen Hunt who is so frail as to seem much older. I hope she's okay."
3,Just did not care for it.,I LOVE Helen Hunt in anything she does but this movie was just downright boring to me. IMO it was not worth the time I watched it.
3,RomCom With A Twist,I watched this movie because I am a Colin Firth fan. I think Helen Hunt is an amazing talent and Bette Midler is always good for laughs.
1,AWEFUL,"A BORE, BAD ACTING, AKWARD AND PLAIN BAD. TORTURE JUST SITTIING THROUGH 10 MINS OF THIS MOVIE. DONT WASTE YOURE TIME."
3,"Starts Poorly, Gets Better","Matthew Broderick's minor role in this movie is one where he basically plays a jerk. His relationship with Helen Hunt focuses on human weakness and the consequences of immaturity in what one would hope to be adult relationships. I was just about ready to give up on this movie, but it got interesting and the plot develops once things start to develop with April's new love interest and her biological mother. I don't like to go into plot too much to spoil it for others, but overall, it's pretty good and definitely worth watching. I might even check it out a 2nd time."
1,"Hurtful, selfish, stupid movie","My wife and I hated this movie. We turned it off. It was hurtful and fake, and if anyone has gone through the things this movie portrayed would be as angry at this movie as we were. don't watch."
1,Not what I expected,"I rented that movie mainly because of Colin Firth. Well.. what was he doing in that boring movie? An actor of his calibre deserves much better roles than that. The story is not captivating at all, so much so that my husband slept half through it, and it's a miracle I watched it till the end...hoping for a miracle that din't happen. Such a disappointing movie!"
2,could have been better,"In reality my review reflects more on Helen Hunt's appearance than the movie itself. It is difficult to evaluate and appreciate the movie when you are bogged down by the appearance of one of the actors. Hunt has aged considerably and quickly and additionally looks oddly thin. I am all for an aging actress landing a role and doing so without Botox and other wonders of modern medicine, however, casting such an actress appropriately is essential to the flow of a film. In this movie, Hunt plays a 38 year old, while in reality she was 43, and looks beyond her 43 years. It is not a good casting decision. Unfortunately, Hunt directs and obviously made a poor decision here. Normally, I would hate to criticize appearances, but when casting someone to play a character a few years younger, the actress needs to convincingly convey a younger look. The opposite happened here, with a character that looks ten years older than she is portrayed."
2,Odd movie,"Kept hoping it would get better. Could have been great. Dull, flat and nearly horrid. I kept watching it though, hoping it would improve. I had nothing better to do, except maybe wash my hair, or bake a loaf of bread. I missed both."
1,Gets a No Stars Rating!!!,"PLEASE- DON'T let this whiny, selfish, humorless- and *always* scowling Helen Hunt- centered piece of garbage put you off reading Eleanor Lipman's sweet, gentle, humorous novel.This DRECK only resembles the book in title and that a few of the characters bear the same name as in the book. The resemblance dies there- not even the first few (stupid, off-putting story) lines of this dope-us are from the book.Skip this ""film"" and read Ms. Lipman's sweet, charmingly low-key novel."
1,Can it get worse ?,This movie is so gosh awful it's hard to put in words.The story is so scripted. No emotion or relaity in it at all.Helen Hunt walks around looking like a total hag with a wrinkled brow (she looks well over 50 when she is supposed to be playing a 39 year old. And skinny! What happened to her?) I did not like her character at all. AT ALL!!There is no chemistry between her character and Colin Firth's .. It's ridiculous. And I hated the way she treated her birth mother.Can you tell me ONE possible motive for someone to lie about being someone's mother?? That is just stupid.Bette Midler is lovely but I am embarrassed for her that she took part in this total dog of a film.
1,Boring,"Kept waiting for it to get better - but it didn't. Characters weren't believable and it wasn't funny enough to make it as ""romantic comedy"". Really pretty stupid. Unnecessary use of the F word. I couldn't even watch to the end it was so boring and empty. I was looking for light chick flick brain candy - but this was empty even for that. blech, don't waste your time and certainly not your money."
1,"Dull, inauthentic, unsympathetic","Fabulous cast in an awful movie. Since I was bored I had plenty of time to think: is Colin Firth ashamed of having made this thing?, how did they get Bette Midler to agree to be in this movie?, who was the guy always with the Bette Midler character? why is her brother absent so much of the film? And in general why is the Helen Hunt character so unlikeable and yet is so loved by her mother, bio-mother, brother and two men? There is nothing to make all those people want to be with her. Should have watched re-runs of Mad About You."
2,Get out the clothes-pins ... Stinkeroo!,"Helen Hunt plays a newly married 39-year old woman whose biological clock is ticking. Her callow hubby, played by Matthew Broderick, dumps her and she soon thereafter takes up with the father (Colin Firth) of one of her preschool students. Right!The cast is strong but cannot carry this weak plot. The characters are two-dimensional and formulaic. There wasn't a single one I cared for. At times, Helen Hunt sounds like she is literally reading her lines. The pacing is slow as a tortoise.I wish she hadn't found me!"
2,Then she found me.,"Hard language was not expected! The F bomb is dropped including,""Jesus F'ing Christ."" This is unacceptable. Not for families. Otherwise it was fair."
3,Dissappointed,"I thought this would be a great movie. First of all, I love Helen Hunt and have since Mad About You. But this movie dragged and was somewhat boring. I thought the actors looked horrible, excpet for Bette Midler. I mean Helen Hunt is beautiful, but she looked soooo old and depressed all the time! I couldn't even finish watching it unfortunately because I lost interest."
5,Then See Found Me,Fantastic movie with great acting. Loved Colin Firth'spart the best. Beth was great also. Great and inspiring story line about adoption.
5,Then She Found Me - touching and funny,Bette Midler's performance made this movie. Great cast. Feel good movie. Probably would relate most to women so watch it with your best girlfriend.
2,Who looks older: Hunt or Midler?,"I agree with all the critical comments here: the plot is hackneyed and painfully predictable; Hunt keeps playing the same role over and over; Firth must've needed the money; Broderick is over the hill; I also agree with the positive reviews, in particular those who note that Bette was the one bright spot. I just couldn't make it to the end. All I could think about was how bad Hunt looked; is she anorexic?. Something seriously wrong here: Bette was born in 1945, Hunt in 1963! While I admire Hunt for her work offscreen getting the book made into a film, I'm afraid it wasn't worth the effort. I'm glad I got this through Amazon Prime. If I had paid for it, I would be annoyed more than I already am for wasting one hour on this film. Admittedly, this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the best!"
2,I watched the whole film and now I wonder why I did,"I kept waiting to care about the characters in this film but, after wasting the nearly 2 hours it took to get to the end of the story, I found that NONE of the characters had a single redeeming or likable quality and I couldn't have cared less about how any of them ended up.I'll admit that I've never much liked Helen Hunt as an actor but, since I do (usually) like the other leading actors, I didn't but should have followed my better instincts to just shut the film off.What this film shows are 4 different examples of totally messed up adults that never managed to mature. The ONLY ""grown up"" decision was made by one of the characters at the age of 15. Beyond that, nothing but emotional cripples. Sound like your cup of tea? It sure doesn't come close to mine!I'd recommend you pass on this one.(2 STARS instead of 1 simply because I like watching a couple of the actors. Probably should have given it only 1 STAR.)"
2,"Great actors, terrible script","Because of the great actors in it, I was eagerly anticipating this movie. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Though Hunt tried, the script just didn't let the actors bring their characters to the screen. In short, save your money."
4,Not your typical Hollywood comedy - lots of heart and some tears,"This is a comedy that does not ask you to suspend your belief and laugh at contrived situations. Each one of the characters - Hunt (a 39 year old childless women who was dumped by her husband but who still longs for a biological child of her own), Firth (a divorced father of two young children who is still recovering from his failed marriage), Broderick (an immature ex-husband who does not know what he wants), and Midler (a local celebrity who is doing all she can to gain the acceptance and love of her daughter whom she had abandoned during infancy) are flawed in their own ways. Yet, I can empathize with each one of them and find them all likable. The plot is different and in my opinion richer and better and more realistic than that of the typical Hollywood comedy. What makes this a good movie is that I do care what happens to each of the characters! The bittersweet situations in the movie were just the icing on the cake."
4,not a bad flick,We recently killed DirecTV so have reverted to Amazon Prime and NetFlix. This was a movie neither of us had ever heard of but decided to watch it. We both enjoyed it and decided we'll have to watch it again
4,interesting view on adoption,"This movie may not be for everyone, but I found it interesting and well acted. Nothing else to say about this movie why do I need 15 words?"
2,Bette Midler Saved This Movie From A One Star,"This movie started slow and an hour into it I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, by that time I felt I had so much time invested I may as well watch the rest. What torture. Horrible movie with disfunctional characters that behave like fools. Then finally Bette walked in and saved the day, she didn't have any great script to rely on though. Helen Hunt and Matthew Broderick don't have any chemistry and they're not believable as a couple so when things get rocky in their marriage you find yourself rooting for the break up. Helen's more believable with Colin Firth but her role makes her out to be an idiot. There's nothing interesting about this movie, not even the setting. I'm a huge Colin Firth and Bette Midler fan and their roles here are forgettable."
2,Hunt's Good....Movie ISN'T!,"Wow...what a jumpy, choppy, uninteresting story. There are many great actors in this movie that just seem lost. Hunt does a great job with her character, but the movie isn't strong enough for it. Broderick was just an extra it seemed, appearing in random segments. Midler's performance was annoying. Poor Firth should have picked a better script as well.Don't bother with this one. This movie just proves the extreme excess that Hollywood pays for substandard quality."
1,Directing and Acting is Distracting,"I am not sure what Helen Hunt was thinking here, but this movie is a total waste of time. It's also a total waste of Colin Firth's talent. Ms. Hunt looks terrible in this film and I am not sure if that is the way her character is supposed to look. Even with a little bit of make-up on, she looks very tired. The dialogue is snappy and at times funny and that is partly due to Bette Midler's comedic talents. Both, she and Colin Firth, save the film in some of the scenes. Matthew Broderick looks like he is being forced to act. The story and how it evolves is choppy at best and does not have a consistency to it that could have saved the film on some level. Helen Hunt is a terrific actress and should stick to acting because directing and acting at the same is distracting. And it shows."
3,Her Life During Watershed 'Passages',"Harried in her life, April Epner (Helen Hunt) has so many life changes, it's almost futile to count. Her immature husband (Matthew Broderick) is leaving her; her endearing adoptive mother dies; and her estranged natural mother (Bette Midler) crosses her path. Throw in meeting the parent (Colin Firth) of one of her young students, and you've befuddled Gail Sheehy's 'Passages'. Genuine laughs and some heartfelt soul searching make for a dramedy of substance. Midler is fresh and funny as the talk show host mother; Firth shows more repertoire in a strong, solid character role as her boyfriend; but Hunt carries the show with her frayed character who gets deeper as her ordeal of romance and faith move along. One of the better intelligent comedies to come out in a while.A J.P.'s Pick 3*'s = Good"
4,ENJOYABLE,"I ENJOYED THE MOVIE. IT PROTRAYED REAL LIFE,OUR MISTAKES AND OUR ABILITY TO FORGIVE AND LOVE AGAIN THROUGH IT ALL."
2,Don't waste your time,"All of the actors had great ernest, but the story was so contrived and you really never cared for the protagonist (Helen Hunt). I'm not sure why this story got told. I overall left me displeased with all of the characters and more than a bit sad. Not a RomCom, just a forced drama."
2,Where's the comedy?,The bright spot in this movie was Bette M. I don't understand how an actor of Firth's calibre could waste his talents by appearing in this drivel. To characterize this movie as a comedy is a total misleading fib. Nothing like the book!
4,suprisingly good,"I love all of the actors in this quirky movie but I thought it was going to be one of those movies that missed the mark. I found that I was entertained all of the way through this film. It was more ""indie drama"" than mainstream romantic comedy but there were some genuinely funny parts and the dramatic parts were captivating because acting was great."
4,Makes you think,I enjoyed how this movie represented that life dosen't always turn out how we have it planned. But we can find love and happiness.
3,Interesting Concept,Found it a little slow and strange. Good story of consequences and how we make decisions in a single moment that can destroy the good in our lives.
3,YThen She Found Me,It's Okay started out very low thenbecame interesting. Characters in the movievery serious need more comedy in this flick.
4,Nice little movie,I really liked the movie. All of the actors are good and the story seemed true to life. I would recommend this film.
1,Horrible Horrrible Horrrrrrrible Movie,"This is a horrible movie. Don't watch it. It's boring and the acting is awful. You think it's going somewhere and then it leads you to a brickwall where you ask yourself ""Why did I watch this movie?"" The movie is slow, the lighting, sets, and writing are bad. The acting is just horrible. I really feel like the director failed these actors. These actors are great, just not in this movie. Also, the main character sucks, she really deserves a horrible life because she expects nothing from her life. She does nothing to make herself move forward in a positive way. Hey if you want to watch a movie about people who are negative and get themselves stuck in a hole, a boring, why watch this movie, hole? Go ahead and waste an hour and 41 minutes with this movie. It will make you want to blow your brains out due to the fact that anyone watching this movie could have written a better movie."
2,"Even for free, a lame movie","I watched this movie for free thru Amazon Prime. Helen Hunt - love her. Bette Midler - great. Matthew Broderick and Colin Firth - good actors. But the movie itself was just lame. Not sure there was a point to all of it... a lot of disappointing choices made by the characters, more cursing than I care for, no real ""highs"" and just not a ""feel good"" movie. I don't recommend... even for free."
2,Yuck,"Half way through watching this I realized I had already seen it a few years ago, but it was so unremarkable I had forgotten all about it. Helen Hunt's character just has nothing going for her. She's cold and unappealing; her angst is uninteresting and seems self-centered. One wonders what the Colin Firth character (why there are 2 starts isatead of 1) sees in her. Normally I like these actors, but ... don't waste your time!"
3,Fluffy.,"A bit of fluff for a rainy evening. Lead actress didn't strike me as the femme fatale men would fight over and Matthew Broderick was, uncharacteristically, flat as a pancake. Firth is always nice to look at. Midler was a bit disappointing as it didn't take advantage of her comedic abilities. Potential in the story line but just wasn't all that funny or moving. Not sure which it was supposed to be."
3,On your own,"One of my favorite songs from the 80's is the New York mix of On Your Own. If anyone from the record company is reading this, can you release another version of this CD with the extended versions?For others, this is in my view a more mature-sounding Pete Shelley than his earlier works. Although the sound is very 80's it is the sound of mid-80's, slightly less energetic, and a little more solemn. But it's still a great CD and worth buying if you enjoy 80's music."
2,Not worth looking at if you're serious,"This book was on discount sale at my local bookstore and I see why now. For someone who has never touched Linux or Unix and wants to read a glorified advertising brochure about its potential, this is a good text. It answers the question ""what is possible if I were to buy Linux"" and maybe ""how would I get started if all goes well""...not the real system admin questions like ""what can I do exactly"" or ""how do I do the following..."". If you are an experienced Linux user (like even 2 days experience) you'll be offended by this book."
1,utter tripe,"this book is down there with linux unleashed. It tries to cover every linux topic under the sun, while subtly missing everything useful about every topic.this book should be completely avoided at all costs. the authors (I can't imagine how it took two to write) have just gleaned information from the intros in every howto.get the howtos. if you want it in hardcopy, get a printer. or get the latest linux bible.actually, I would have given this book 0 stars if that was an option."
3,Appropriate for Beginners,"This book is good as an introduction to Linix administration for readers who are completely new to Linix. I concur with a number of the readers in that this book does lack depth. For myself, it was useful in terms of the breadth of information provided. If you are completely new to this operating system, this book suffices as an overview of common administrative tasks. You will get a basic feel for what needs to be done, but you won't learn operating-system specifics for your particular distribution of Linix. My recommendation is that if you are new, use this book as a start. Identify why you are setting up a Linix server (or workstation) and then jump to the appropriate chapters on that topic. The book is well-organized, so you'll have no problem finding your way around. When you're ready, buy another book that focuses on what you're interested in."
2,A Starting point at best,I found this book to deal with several importiant issues. The problem that I had with the book was the lack of real world examples. I have learned more about surfing the internet than I did from this book.
1,I am disappointed.,"As a beginner to Linux, I bought this book 5 months ago, mainly because it promised ""practical advice from expert system administrators"" and on browsing, was very readable. However I found later to my disappointment that this book did not deliver good practical guide to installing or administrating Linux. It covers a lot of topics but most of them in a superficial manner. For problems I came across and turned to this book, I had in most cases, not been able to find the answers. I definitely do not recommend it to someone who needs help to learn and setup a Linux system from the ground up."
1,Who is this book for?,"I'm a pretty experienced computer interested in setting up and running my first Linux based server. This book sets out to be the 'ultimate' Linux book, but neither addresses the immediate needs of novices nor the specific technical needs of an advanced user. You'd be better of just reading the Linux 'Howto' docs and other information freely available on the Internet than buying this doorstop."
3,Superficial. Doesn't take the place of thorough references.,"On page 2 of this useful but undistinguished Linux work, the authors grandly announce that ""This is not just a Linux book. This is the Linux book."" It is hard to see on what basis this claim can be substantiated. For instance, using a networked printer, i.e., one with its own IP address and Ethernet card, is not a trifle in many Linux installations, yet the authors devote virtually no time to the topic. To quote, ""Be sure that if you do get a network printer, there are drivers, or some other interface to allow Linux to talk to it."" As true as this is, it hardly makes the Linux sysadmin's life easier. In short, this book adds little to the quality of a Linux administrator's working life, all the more so if he has access to other, more thorough texts."
2,False advertisement,"This ink was advertised as Brother Model LC41BK Black Injet Cartridge, leading me to believe it was Name brand, but when it arrived, it was compatible, not original. I feel this was very missleading and false advertisement. If I wanted compatible ink, I would have looked for compatible ink and paid the appropriate price. I only give it two stars because the ink is compatible. I won't buy from databazaar again!"
1,breaks quickly,The produst lasted me all of a month before the power cord broke. I tried contacting their websales department but i never recieved a response. tech support told me there was nothing they could do so my $80 burner remains useless. definatley buy at your own risk.
5,Takes the work out of shopping,"I loved the convenience of shopping on the Internet but I had trouble finding the sites that sell what I want. Not any more! This book lists over one thousand sites that sell everything you can imagine. Where else could you find sites that sell spy and security goodies, decorator umbrellas and ladies lingerie all in the same book? You can even go to to the author's Internet site to find reviews of new shopping sites and, more importantly, the sites that have gone belly-up since the book was published."
4,A good starting point for the serious Les Paul afficianado!,"Tony Bacon books are always top notch: stunning photos, accurate descriptions and very well researched. This book is no exception. It is, however in my opinion, an excellent overview of the famous Les Paul guitar---not a resource book. At 160 pages it does a very fine job of detailing how this legendary guitar has blossomed into SO many different models over the last 50 plus years (up to 2001). Sticklers for details, however, will probably find it lacking in some areas (year by year pix and descriptions,for example), but then one would need a book twice as thick to serve as this kind of encyclopedia on the subject. I highly recommend it as an introduction to Les Pauls, and it will probably be all that most guitarists want to know about the subject. It would make a great gift!"
5,Great summary of a great line of guitars,"I've always found it fascinating that the one man who did so much for rock and roll guitar isn't a rock and roller himself. But who cares if Les Paul is a jazz or country artist? He inspired a fantastic instrument, and this is a wonderful guide to those greatest electric guitars. Highly recommended."
2,In Defence of the Revolution,Ms. Rosendahl's book reads more like a master's thesis than an informative book. It was apparent to this reader that she started with strong feminist and socialist tendencies which caused the conclusions to be less than candid.Expect a book that starts with preconcieved notions that socialism is a very good thing and that without Castro's revolution there would have been no progress in Cuba in the last thirty years.Overall a very dry boring work that was difficult to follow. Many of her conclusions will ring very false with anyone who has visited Cuba in the last eight years or has the ability to form objective opinions of the state of the people.
3,Just the basics,"I'm kinda over getting jerseys with names and numbers on the back, unless it is an oldtimer. If the price is right this is a good serviceable item. I like the cream color."
5,Best single I've heard in years!,"The haunting refrain ""Sometimes ... the sound of goodbye ... is louder than .... any drumbeat"" will echo and reverberate in your consciousness for years to come!"
1,Alfie Waste of time and paper,"The nicest thing that I can say about this book is that it is a quick read. The main character, Alfie is a womanizing, abusive, egotistical,despisable man. He is every man you warn the women you love to stay away from. He hurts the married women that he dates (okay, they are cheating, so they deserve it)but he hurts innocents (Annie)too. None of the charcters are likeable - the woman are either stupid, cheaters, or weak. I found the book to be shallow and am very glad to be done with it."
4,Open Office. Org 2,"Ordered to use as reference for computer software, but felt it was not easy to follow, when trying something new on the computer....must read the entire chapter first. Otherwise, very good!"
3,Peter is terrific but this isn't his best,"Peter released the best CD of his solo career in ""Long Line"" of 1996. This is a must for any true fan of the ""woofa-goofa."" Johnny A. who played and produced the ""Long Line"" CD brought out the best in Peter that had not been done since Seth Justman when Pete was in J Geils. If I were Peter, I'd work all the time with Johnny A as he understands Peter's music in a way only Seth had.""Fools Parade"" is Peter indulging his r&b; side but not doing it in an interesting way. It seems to plod along without a focus and aside from a few songs is dull. If you own it or want to own it, I say great because Peter is to be respected but, in the final analysis, ""Fools Parade"" is not his best effort by a long shot.Buy ""Long Line"" to get Pete's finest solo moment and, perhaps, a release that holds up to much of his J Geils work as well."
2,Imports are silly/don't buy it.,"Sorry, but one of only two good songs on the 'Eat Me, Drink Me' album are found right here. Yes, ""Heart Shape Glasses"" is a cool tune...but the other sing isn't worth spit..anyway it's presented. Actually, despite the fact that Marilyn manson has established himself as one of the most meaningful songwriters in Rock History, there is no evidence of that on this horribly rediculous album (Eat me Drink Me). All I can say, is that if your looking for a rip off of My Chemichal Romance, HIM, Modest Mouse...you found it. Manson is still a legend...but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date."
4,Great CD.,"Having been a fan of Leon Thomas since the 60's, I found it refreshing to have such an assortment, from various periods, included on 1 CD. Buy it!!!"
1,I wish there was a lower rating!,"When you spend money on a study guide you expect to at least cover the basics needed for the test. You do not get it here. A lot of the material on the test was not covered here, unless you count a website address. Sorry, but for this money I expect the book to cover it and any links to be for more in depth information. For example the book did not even cover the basic html in enough depth to have answered 1/2 of the questions I had on my exam (I passed, but only because I was only also studying Network+ at the same time). Save your money!"
4,Woman's Perspective,"Just finished Rage, read and re-read the A. Pope poem, from which the book title is derived. This is, indeed, a novel centered in transitions, and treats the heroine, Grace, with sensitivity and judgment. Most, like Louis Begley, who wrote the introduction, might leap to the conclusion that Grace, through her choices/dalliances, was relegated to exile in NYC. My somewhat feminist perspective is that Grace outgrew her provincial circumstances, embraced an essential part of herself, and moved on in the wake of unavoidable tragedy - almost certainly to the benefit of herself and her children. I'm not so sure much has changed in the US, especially in small towns. Rage is a good read, overly long in some places, and as mentioned, abrupt in others, in significant respects. I skimmed much of the boring dialogue and superfluous character setups, but otherwise found the novel engrossing."
1,Phooey!,I think I am alone in my opinion that pretty much everything written or said in the 60's was over blown pap.O'Hara's fantasy women drop their pants and have orgasms like men. Men wish...I've tried a couple of his stories now and I don't get his appeal. He sounds like he's being paid by the word. His women are from another planet. Men only wish that sex were that easy.O'Hara's reputation is much like another icon of the 60's -- Elizabeth Taylor.Producers kept giving her employment in film - and even after the gushing results - they voted to give her AWARDS!!But then I thought Elvis Presley was an embarrassment too -
5,A masterpiece,"I don't know who to praise more, the brilliant Austrian conductor Franz Welser-Most, or the ""always surprising"" Cleveland Symphony.Not to mention the composer, Anton Bruckner. His eighth symphony is a masterpiece: some people view it as the devout Bruckner having a conversation with God. That may or may not be true, but it is well worth listening in on the conversation.The DVD is riveting, and it's one of the finest I own.I would like to hear from the Bruckner experts, however --- what is their opinion of this performance as opposed to the one on the Karajan boxed set of the complete Bruckner symphonies?"
1,Awful,This book is horrible. Written as if the person reading it chews rubber-bands and drinks glue for entertainment. Avoid any class using this book. Would give .10 star if possible.
1,crap designer's republic rip off... no original ideas here,"DED are a direct derivative of designer's republic and they know it. It is not enough that they are in the same building and that they use the same design styles and that they steal the look, feel and personality of DR... they had to go and publish this truly pedestrian book.DED are perfect examples of pragmatic, uninteresting, mediocre designers.Read this if your goal in life is to be a low-level production artist who cuts up the work of others."
1,Hair: Its Power and Meaning....,"An awful atrocity of the literary genre. It was like the personal notebooks of various authors compiled into an uneven mess. Too many articles, too many footnotes & references to page numbers of other books, too little of pictures. Too many irrelevant points of view. I did not enjoy it. It's only a few hundred pages and is entirely black & white, and it was way to high-priced. Like $24.00. If you're looking for any meaning or pictures of the wonderful & elaborate hair dos of Asia, you will find no information in this horrible book."
1,No Heat,"I bought this item for the warmth. The heat level is so low that I never can tell when the heat is on. As for the massage, it's about what I expected - no good at all. Overall, I would say this item is worthless."
1,Disappointing,"Based on the reviews, I thought I would be treated to a fresh new novel from a fledgling author. Instead what I got was what appeared to be a homework assignment for a creative writing class. Throughout the book, I felt like literary devices were being foisted upon me. Like she had to use a requisite number before completing this mind-numbing novel."
5,lovely & astonishing,"i found this novel to be wondrous & delightful. the first chapter is exhilarating, one of the most original, most gorgeous bits of writing i have ever read. ali smith is stylistically clever, yes, but not cute. she uses textual devices to represent different voices: madness, illness, despair, death. Hotel World is magnificently life-affirming, but utterly without cliche or schmaltz."
1,Pass,"Yes, it's another book that made me cranky. From here on I will never ever ever again read another stream-of-consciousness I'm-so-clever-I'm-not-writing-a-linear-tale kind of book. Please keep them away from me. I read about 1/3 of this and then said, enough. No thank you. This one's going to the Sally Ann too. Woo----hoooooooooooo, if I had a dumbwaiter, I'd chuck this book down it."
3,Skip the last chapter.,Hotel World started out strong and then petered out. By the time I had gotten to the long run-on sentence chapter done by Clair I had lost interest in the book.
4,"One of those ""Damn that person can write"" books","OK, for me the story itself here was at best, OK - something that one could have dreamed up by sitting in a hotel lobby one winter day and making up stroies for the people you observe passing by. It reminded a bit of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway in style. What impressed me was Ali Smith's gift for writing. At times the book reads more like a poem than a novel. Her observations of the sights, sounds, smells, and feelings that her characters undergo is breathtakingly realistic. You can literally see/hear/smell/feel it in your mind as you read. Her musings on death and on life as a series of frozen moments is bound to send the reader into long periods of contemplation on finality. Her characters seem like people we know or have seen. She is a truly gifted writer."
3,Very Strange,"The buzz on the book caught my attention. The first chapters were interesting, but the book wore on me and I was glad when it was finished. In one chapter the dead girl's sister uses the & sign every time she means to say and, gimmicky, overused and annoying me thinks... Runner up for a big award?"
1,Totally disappointing.,I forced myself through half the book and had to give up. What hype this novel got - it was sure not deserved.
3,Peter Redeker,"It was nice to get the book at all but it was fragile as the pages come easily out.However, as the book is old - it is to be expected.Thanks,Cc."
4,Out of the ordinary,"Most business English books are tedious, boring. This book is a very nice exception. Lots of different activities and combinations to learn grammar and writing along practices for conversation. Good aid."
2,"Barely Business, no Conversation","The title is comletely misleading. This is a book of grammar exercises. Chapters are entitled Nouns"", ""Verbs"", ""Correct Punctuation""- you get the idea. Even the sentences and examples used in the grammar are unrelated to business. The only bow to business is in the last 20 or so pages which are about letter writing, telegrams (!), memos and other business writing forms. As far as I can see, there is no conversation skill practice at all. I gave it two stars because it you want a succint little grammar practice book, it's ok. But go elsewhere for business and/or conversation."
2,Not very good!,This books title is misleading. It has very little conversation and even less business conversation. It is a good reference book. It could also be a supplement book for a class but when working overseas it could only prove to be useful asa supplement for the teacher.
4,"Superficial, but to the point","It was real improvement on the first book. More precise and with fewer errors. The part about tuning is very close to the exam's contents. But do not count on it for getting broad knowledge on the subject. If you really want to study, read the Oracle on-line books and only then use the cram series. On the whole, it serves its purpose."
5,Good exam prep,"The book delivered. I passed both exams at the first time. Much is covered quickly. The numerous tests in the book uncovered weak areas, so then you can go find in depth material - like Oracle online docs. I couldn't make it through the Oracle Press 5 inch tome, too tediously detailed, but this series worked for me. Book #1 was weak in the sql/plsql area, but DB Admin in it was fine. Overall, a useful Exam Cram."
1,Poor content and limited information on Backup & Recovery,"The poor organization of this book is overshadowed by the mistakes and lack of information. There is very, very limited information on Backup and Recovery and is not enough to pass the Exam. The only thing positive thing about this book is The Cram Sheet, an insert in the front of the book. My advice, go to a book store and rip The Cram Sheet out; You'll get more information in jail than from this book."
4,A Good Resource,"I used this book for both Backup & Recovery and Performance Tuning, in conjunction with other reference material and STSWARE practice exams.The book was excellent for an overview that gives MOST of the framework, but you will need other material to fill in the minute details. Don't expect to buy any one book that has it all. And of course, it is more meaningful if you actually are a DBA.Worth the money."
1,Lacks detail in Backup & Recovery Section,"I used this book (Exam Cram - Test 3 & Test 4 for OCP) and the Jason Couchman (Oracle Press) DBA Exam Guide (the one that's over 1000 pages in length) to review recently for the Backup & Recovery Exam for the Oracle Certified Professional Track. This book's section on Backup and Recovery really wasn't adequate in my opinion to pass the test. It did provide a very good general overview, but one really needed the Couchman book to get the level of detail sufficient to answer some of the questions on the certification exam. I did pass, however, but do feel that this book alone would not have sufficed as the single resource to study for the exam. I cannot vouch for the Tuning section of the book (Exam 4 in the series), because I have not read that section at all."
3,Read with utmost care,Found the book to be helpful. Covers important aspects but need to be careful as there are some very serious errors in the book.
1,Even 1 star is 1 too many!,"If zero stars were possible I would rate this book zero stars. Both books from the cram series covering the OCP program are full with typos, wrong and contradicting answers and totally wrong about certain concepts (a shocking example is e.g. the part on CKPT and DBWR background processes). If you are not so certain about your theoretical background, you better read the terse but mostly correct Oracle documentation that comes with your Oracle rdbms software."
3,A useful book at an inexpensive price,"While this book by itself will not be enough to get through the OCP program, it is a good buy for the experienced DBA who just needs to sharpen up in a few areas before taking the test. The extra test questions alone are worth the price of the book. A separate book for the last two tests was also a good idea. Hopefully the authors will also write a separate book for the upgrade exam."
1,"Again, not enough to handle OCP for any but the expert...","And still, no Oracle8. A good strategy is to cast the net wide. The author does not do this, instead focusing on helping only those who arguably need no help. The intermediate reader or the career changer should look elsewhere for help with OCP exam preparation"
1,Thackeray bio by equally great contemporary,Great idea but no quality control for printing this paperback. So far off-center rendered itunreadable.
4,"funny, more helpful for ""traditional"" younger couples","Very funny, I read parts out loud to my fiancee, and he laughed too. There is some helpful information, but the bottom line is, ""make yourself happy first."" Men and women are treated respectfully, with the views of each presented with kindness and humor. There is some helpful information. It is more geared towards ""traditional"" couples, those with mom and dad involved in the wedding, big families, and couples receiving financial assistance for the wedding from their families. It's not quite as helpful for older couples, but still very funny."
4,Where all the fun began...,"Recorded and released without all the hype and expectations of their later albums allowed Night Ranger to do on Dawn Patrol what it did best--record rocking anthems that shredded while staying true to its melodic roots. On Dawn Patrol, the Night Ranger formula of dueling guitars, in-your-face keyboards, thundering drums, and good songwriting melded into a rocking album from start to finish (notably, with no ballads). Though some of their most classic songs would came later, Dawn Patrol is Night Ranger's best album overall."
1,Don't buy Mad Cat record label,"Paid a few dollars more for this cd because i thought Mad Cat record label would be the original record label. It wasn't, you can actually hear the scratches in the record that they recorded it off of on the cd. Worst sound quality of any cd that i have ever heard. Actually tossed this cd in the garbage. Will never buy any Mad Cat recording ever again. Had to give it one star to submit review, but wanted to give it a negative 10."
3,"Night Ranger's ""Dawn Patrol"".","""Dawn Patrol"" was Night Ranger's debut album, released in 1982 was a great rock record in the day, but for me it hasn't aged well. This sounded good when I was 22, but now at 51, some of these songs don't click anymore. The songs that still do it for me are: ""Don't Tell Me You Love Me"" #40 hot 100 and #4 mainstream rock, still a smoking' hot number. ""Sing Me Away"" #54 hot 100, ""Eddie's coming Out Tonight"" and ""Night Ranger"". The rest of the disc has gone flat for me now."
3,promising,"I dusted this effort off recently while transferring a wealth of vinyl to digital. Musically the album, like you would expect from such a talented band, is very good. With a couple guitarslingers like Jeff Watson and the underrated Brad Gillis you expect a lot. The songs are hit and miss though. At times the band shows uncanny pop sensibility with songs such as ""Don't Tell You Love Me"" and ""Young Girl in Love"" and at other times can't seem to find a good melody such as ""Play Rough"" ""Eddie's comin' out Tonight"". Knowing the two heavyweights playing guitar makes one expect more from the band, but alas, they could never deliver a solid front to back album. I find it interesting to look back at videos from this era a see that ""Fitz"" Gerald and the keyboardist from Prince's ""1999"" era band band both mined the surgeon-in-scrubs look. LOL. The album is worth picking up though, just to get the epic ""Don't Tell Me..."" a rocker for the ages. This alone gets it an extra star."
4,Wrong track list!!!,"An excellent album, to be sure but the track list on this page doesn't apply to Dawn Patrol!"
2,bleah,"Schlock Rock, Cock Rock.....whatever you want to call it. I'm just glad those days and those types of bands are gone. Brad Gillis was a douch bag!"
3,80's Night Ranger is good but outdated by 2009 standards,"I like this album alot as I grew up listening to it. The problem only lies in listening to it now. Some songs are just too overdosed with synths and keyboards. The worst offender is ""At night she sleeps"". The keys on that song are laughable. ""Sing me Away is my favorite track. When you listen to ""Hole in the Sun"", the songs are much more up to date while still sounding like Night Ranger.Russ D'AngeloMassapequa, New York"
3,"A few problems aside, it's still fairly good.","I totally remember the Walking UFO project that Boss Hog had problems with. It drove my entire class insane, and only 3 people were able to finish it by just throwing the book out. The flow of several of the activites is broken too much... The editors really should have had people test these things out over and over to iron out these hiccups.All this aside, this book was still helpful to have around. Not perfect, but it makes a good reference and can even give some good inspiration. All in all, it's worth the price and weight of the book (carrying this to and from school is MURDER). Certainly better than some of the other books."
2,Only good if you know the program,"This book is a good reference but not for those who are not proficient already in MAX. As others have stated, the examples often skip steps, assume knowledge of the workings of the program and show ""this is what you should end up with"" pictures that don't relate at all to what the instructions give. I get the impression also that each chapter was written by a different person because they cover material that has sometimes been discussed or later chapters cover basic material that was left out at the beginning. If you are beginner, don't buy this."
2,Too Much Becky & Dave Fighting,"I am a strong supporter for the earlier Real Wheel Videos (before Dave and Becky began to fight during each of their episodes); however, this one should be skipped for more sensitive children. Specifically, Dave and Becky fight a little more harshly than in their previous videos, and I am not too keen on having my children exposed to monster trucks named ""Big Dummy."" Granted, they'll probably be exposed to this language later on, I'd just rather it didn't happen on my watch."
4,I Like the Systematic Approach,"Like many of us running small businesses, I have no choice but to come up with ads, brochures, press releases, etc. myself. This book gives me a systematic way of doing so, and I credit it with saving me a lot of money in missteps. If you follow the guidelines and checklists carefully, you will probably produce advertising and promotional material that at the very least avoids being amateurish, and will probably sell some products. I like that it concisely gives an overview over each of the areas of advertising and promotion. It explains insider terms without being condescending. Any Gripes? If I could afford the ""test"" runs of 5000 mailing pieces before I made my ""real"" mailing of many times that, I wouldn't be reading this book now would I?! But I am probably making excuses for not following their advice on testing advertising, and would be better off if I followed it. The book has been a great help in building my business, and I consult it frequently."
4,Very good for the novice,"This book holds your hand every step of the way, The information is well presented and helpful."
3,Beatitude Study,A good supplement for someone taking a thorough look at the Beatitudes. Homiletical insight useful.
5,Informative,"It is so inspiring to see that most theologians do their homework when they write these books. Thank you for taking on such a controversial subject matter as Atonement and thank you for this most important and inspiring work.Chris J. Trevino, ThD."
3,"Good connection, bad retraction.",I was in need of a portable ethernet cord and this was exactly what I had in mind. The retraction was pretty good the first few times I used it but prolonged usage proved otherwise. The retraction gets stuck and doesn't rewind the cord all the way anymore. I would not repurchase this in the future mainly due to this fact.
4,An embarrassment of riches,"Over 80 musicians play new arrangements of Zorn's free-jazz/klezmer compositions. The result is a marathon of exotic and beautiful music. As if the Jewish jazz approach wasn't enough, these musicians stretch out, simplify, and re-organize the music into strange shapes and sounds.This is the most eclectic Masada album since Bar Kokhba. Every track is good. Half of them are great (especially Mike Patton and William Winant doing Kochot)."
5,Revealing work.,"Everytime Zorn puts something out, I hope to listen to either something experimental and strange or something that can become my all time favorite album.Voices in the Wilderness is a shure thing - you can't be wrong with so many good musicians playing some tunes of Masada's songbook. My favorite is Tizah: pacific melody and beautiful interpretation by Pachora.This may not be the best place to start, but it is as easy listening as Bar Kokhba or The Circle Maker. Let Zorn touch your spirit with his magic music!"
3,"Not bad, but Masada does a better Masada album...","This CD would've been great had they taken the best songs on both CD's and made one excellent CD. Half the tunes are fabulous, the other half are bores. It's up to the listener, ultimately, to decide which are which. MMW's contribution is noteworthy. As is most of Disc 2. If your deeply into Masada buy the album. If you didn't like Masada - you won't like this either - chances are..."
4,As Expected,"Product was delivered as specified on Amazon page. These are getting hard to find, so glad that Amazon makes these available."
2,Poorly edited and missing important information.,"This book is just a rehash of existing Linux documentation and HOWTOs, but with more typos. It had a handful of new insights, but not enough to warrant buying this book. Instead, I highly recommend Matt Welsh's ""Running Linux (3rd Edition)""."
3,"Some useful tips, but disappointing and too many typos.","This book looked great in the bookstore. However, it is a strange book. It feels very rough, rushed. It assumes the reader knows some techy stuff about GCC and compiling kernels, but then assumes the reader doesn't know what 'ls' does! In many places, this book tries to cater to two audiences (newbie and advanced), but misses the mark. To be fair, I have found some useful new tips. Unfortunately, there are serious typos on seemingly every other page."
4,Yum Yum,"Rachael Ray's book highlights 30 meals which can be prepared in 30 minutes or less. This, of course, is a man's dream (and probably a woman's, too).The recipes are simple and the outcomes are delicious. The meals cover a wide range of foods, so it never gets boring or repetitive.My only real complaint is that I wish there were more than 30 recipes. Maybe I want too much, but I would have liked to see this book about triple the size."
5,Great!,I love these recipes. And the cook book is so small that it makes it one of my favorites. I have a small kitchen so sometimes large cook books get in the was but this one is perfect. Delicious recipes.
2,"Good food, but NOT ""Guy Food""!","I bought this book for my father, who in his 50's began to express an interest in cooking. He has never cooked more than a hamburger before, and is a guy of very simple food tastes. He loves to watch Rachel Ray on TV, so when I saw this ""Guy Food"" cookbook, I thought it would be perfect for him.I was utterly wrong. The recipes are elaborate and too ""fancy"" for my dad. Personally, I don't know many guys, outside of hardcore foodies or chefs, who would attempt to make, or even voluntarily eat, some of the dishes in this book. My father ended up just giving the book back to me. And I did cook some of the recipes in it for him. The food is good. But the title is a complete misnomer. I was very disappointed, and though I enjoy her food, I doubt I will purchase another Rachel Ray cookbook. I'm too afraid of what I'll end up getting."
4,simplified options for men (and others) who want a quick meal,"This book has some great options for men and others who want quick meals. If you like meat, you'll enjoy this. If you're a vegetarian or watching your meat intake, maybe not so much, although she does mention vegetables from time to time.Over all, a pretty good book with some quick and simple recipes for people who don't have a lot of time. It was good enough that I'd look at her other books and consider purchasing them."
5,Cuts pills cleanly in half!,This pill splitter works really well. Beats using a knife and less dangerous to your fingers!
1,the pill splittter did not work at all well the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin),the Deluxe Pill Splitter By Apex Healthcare did not work WELL at all FOR the most important medication I needed to split (Coumadin). I am very disappointed in it. Can you send me a return authorization and replace the splitter with another more suitable one?
4,NOT BAD,THE GRIP SURFACE HOLDS THE PILL FIRMLY. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IT IS HARD TO LINE IT UP AS IT DOES NOT MOVE EASY. IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY OFF YOU WILL CRUSH PART OF THE PILL. THE CONTAINER IS COMPACT SO IT IS EASY TO PLACE IN A POCKET FOR A MAN OR IN A PURSE FOR A WOMAN.
2,blade bends,"I used this pill cutter for about 3 months then the cut started to be uneven. It would not cut a pill evenly in half, or one half was in pieces and the other half of the pill intact. With the prices of pills these days you can't afford to waste 1/2 a pill."
4,pill cutter,Works great but large pills are almost to big so forget the horse pills been using it for about 1 to 2 months.
3,Disappointed.,"I much admired Charlie Barnet's recording of Skyliner, which I have heard many times before I bought this CD. Unfortunately the rest was not as impressive. However, it is O.K."
2,Politically correct ...,"Don't bother tracking this one down... it's a politically correct fantasy about the AIDS epidemic, complete with equal opportunity victims and a melodramatic happy ending. The cure is being hidden from the people, typical politically correct hollywood style ... cliches. Sure, this is a sensitive topic, so sensitive, few would dare do other than to pat Spinrad on the back. The book is intentionally an unrealistic depiction of the disease, a melodramatic fantasy.The novella(?) is also pretty uneven, since it is basically a rough draft. Older Spinrad is better."
3,Textbooks are boring...,"It's just another textbook that is rather boring. The text is just bla bla bla boring. It drags and drags. The prof I have right now actually wrote in the book, so that is why I had to purchase it for my class. I would not have purchased it if it wasn't for that. Textbooks are just so boring sometimes!"
5,You get what you pay for,"This Scotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser costs a little more than the alternatives, but it's been worth it. We're in the middle of packing for a move and this is SO much better than the little plastic free dispensers that often come with sealing tape. We used to have another no-name gun-type dispenser years ago, but it literally fell apart one day under what wasn't all that serious use.Stick, zip, cut, done. Very smooth."
4,Shootum up!,"This is my favorite Combat Flight Sim. Considering the graphics technology when this sim was introduced, it is excellent. Scenery is accurate. Aircraft are a little ""fuzzy""looking. The ships and carriers need to look more realistic. Combat is fun. In the manual, advice on how to handle dogfights is given by fighter Ace Joe Foss and a few Japenese pilots of the time. Flying this sim enticed me to read Greg ""Pappy"" Boyingtons book, THE BLACK SHEEP. Carrier landings are challenging. It's a good sim, buy it."
2,What is up with The Animals catalog?,"5 stars for content....no stars for audio quality. Does anybody remember all that extra reverb on the original records? Can someone from ""whoever owns the former MGM Animals catalog"" entourage please explain why the original MGM E series masters are not being released onto CD? I have (9) so-called ""re-masters"" from various labels and I have come to the conclusion that I will never be able to obtain clean monophonic CD releases of the pre-""Winds of Change"" MGM material. There are good ""sound quality"" tracks here and there, but you have to buy a lot of repeat material. Acquiring truly mint copies of the original vinyl is expensive (MGM didn't seem to set very high standards for pressing vinyl either).This material is exceptional and deserves far better treatment than basement ProTools hacks cranking this stuff out of their basement."
2,Disappointed!,"This review concerns the sound quality. I read the reviews before deciding to buy this version of Animalisms 2009 through Amazon UK. Having bought Animalism 2006 [Original recording remastered][Original recording reissued]a few weeks ago I can say for certain the difference is huge, as both albums have a track called ""'outcast"", I used as my benchmark.I found my self being totally disappointed after the excellent remastering of Animalism. How any label can put out such a low quality mastering in this day and age is beyond me. Being Repertoire makes it more so!"
3,Animalisms - major disappointment!,"This has been my favourite Animals recording for 35 years, but the time had arrived to replace the ancient vinyl with a CD to last through the future.The original tracks are great; and many of the bonus tracks are worthwhile; but the recording - how did they do it? It is a travesty of CD quality.Most tracks have echoing bass; little subtlety in the treble range (the high hat on the magnificent Gin House Blues has been almost rendered inaudible.) Sweet Little Sixteen's charming off-key beginning is so badly recorded it is hard to tell where Eric Burdon's vocal is astray and where it is in the correct key.All in all, a magnificent sixties rock album, so badly transferred to CD that it is a terrible disappointment."
2,What a pity !,"Having worn out my vinyl copy of Animalisms, the Animals third album, the first beeing ""The Animals"" and the second ""Animals Tracks, I bought the cd on the Repertoire label and it easily qualifies as the worst remastering job I've heard so far.The original punchy sound with excellent bass and good highdefinition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman PLUS that someone put some strange extra ECHO on the tracks. A complete failure ! Repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try- thank God I have the original on tape - in stereo !"
4,Clear as mud,"The Animals' US/UK discography gets confusing at times.Animalism(S) (plural) - The UK album is totally different to the US album Animalism. (not plural)The US equivalent to the UK Animalism(S) (plural) is the album Animalization. And some changes were made to the track selection for the US release LP Animalization.The tracks on the US Animalism were not released in the UK. This US album was the last to feature the 'first' Animals group. Drummer Barry Jenkins played on this US album, replacing John Steele. He stayed on to be the drummer for the 2nd ""Eric Burdon and the Animals"".All the tracks that appeared on the UK 'AnimalismS' and the US 'Animalization', are now available on the ""Don't Bring Me Down: The Decca Years"", CD."
3,"A good re-issue, except for the sound","I was thrilled to order this piece because, although almost all of the material was already released on THE COMPLETE DECCA RECORDINGS CD, I guess that one is out of print, and I wouldn't pay $40 for that. This was reasonably priced and only short one song, I think,However, when I played this CD, which is the entire British album, plus the Decca reissue of the Animals first demo, and the stereo versions on the few songs released in stereo in America, the sound was horrible. Too much bass, distortion, and too high a level (so typical of many CD's). My feeling was that the source for this CD was MP3's somebody downloaded. That is just a guess, but my American vinyl reissue of the US version of the LP is better sounding on most songs.The exception is the track, ""Inside-Looking Out"", which is also over-compressed on the US releases.I just wish this CD was mastered by somebody else. I could do better off the records, I believe!"
5,Designing and Programming CICS Applications,The book was what I was looking for and it was delivered ahead of the projected delivery date.
2,Not the original BBC & no David Attenborough - unbelievable,"The original ""The Himalayas"" is a BBC HD production lovingly narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Well, the visuals are the same (and simply stunning) but only in America would the narration be changed to someone else (an unnamed voice actor). His narration is flat and uninteresting and his timing does not match the visuals. The script and music are the same as the original BBC programme.I'm British living in America and I have found this weird anomaly of voice swap quite a bit with documentaries - overdubbing Oprah Winfrey for Sir David Attenborough in another BBC HD programme and so on. Why, I will never know. I simply find it annoying. And with the ludicrous Blu-ray Region locking (and incompatible 1080i/50hz), I can't just buy the BBC originals from England and play them in America.Oh well... more money wasted.Don't buy if you are expecting Sir David, otherwise it's worth a look for the outstanding BBC cinematography."
1,"Terrible. Buy ""Wild China"" instead!","This is an extremely disappointing product. Most of the footages were actually taken from the ""Wild China"" series by BBC, and the other ones do not look like HD images at all.Narration is poor, the script is also bad. In short: do not buy this."
5,the Himalayas,"great movie - showed up on time, in great condition. Nature/PBS programs are always the best. More detailed than most."
1,TV Basketball,"It looks easy but, I had a hard time getting the functions to work consistently as described in the instructions. It was difficult for me as an adult so it was more frustrating for my nephew who is seven. I could count the number of times we used the game on my one hand. Its just not as simple as it looks and straightforward like the other tv games we have purchased."
2,Doesn't work,Way too complicated. My son tried & tried and just couldn't get it to work. I should have bought a new xbox game instead. Waste of money. I would have returned it but I didn't feel like paying for the shipping which cost more than the game itself.
2,Unbiased?,The book has alot of good information but they continually compare every religion or doctrine to their own obviously fundalmentalist Christian views. It gets a little old time after time reading how this organization is wrong because they're not the right kind of Christian.
4,Good!,I had to read this book for my Business Ethics class and the stories are a good length and definitely makes you think! Especially when you bring it in to discussion in class. I really enjoyed this book!
1,Too many undisclosed biblical references,"This book (By a Christian Counselor) is careless and outdated - it assumes you are Christian, throws out bible passages as examples that don't really parallel the situation at hand, and is redundant, at best. The religious doctrine style is distracting and short-changes the real issues.If I wanted to read a Bible, I would of used my own.Amazon should do a better job of screening their books so people know what they're buying. I would be VERY offended if I were any other religion besides Christian."
5,Great Book!,My wife would constantly go to her parent's house to borrow their Maida Heatter books. I decided it was time for us to have some of our own. I was quite pleased to find there were books that had aggregated her recipes by type. This way we do not have to try to remember which pie is in which book. It's also nice having a large format hard cover rather than paperbacks that are harder to keep open to the page you are using.
4,Travel homework.,"Preparation for a foreign country has many facets. This reading material was an excellent historical, biological and environmental resource. Text and photos gave a comprehensive preview of Peru."
4,A good place to start,"I purchased this book to take with me to the Manu Reserve in Peru. It offered a very nice overview of the wildlife of the area, though I did see quite a few birds, reptiles and mammals that were not included. The illustrations and narratives are well done.I wish the section on snakes was larger and the guide just touched on plant life.My biggest wish is that the insect section would be expanded. There are 1,000 kinds of butterfly in Manu alone, yet the guide hardly touched the subject.An all inclusive guide to all the plants, insects and wildlife would be far from portable, so if you are looking for a travel guide this does its job nicely. Hopefully you can carry this and let your guide haul around the Birds of Ecuador and other more comprehensive guides."
3,disappointed,"Half of the book is pictures and small descriptions of thebirds and other wildlife which is what I wanted (this is what the sample page showed). But the larger half of the book isn't very useful in the field, thus will make it too heavy to carry on our excursions."
4,Pretty good on most subjects,"We were going to the Amazon and Lima only, so much of this book was not pertinent to us on this trip. (We've been to the Andes/Cusco/Macchu Picchu before.) I was looking for a basic book on Amazon birds and animals, and found this to be the best compromise. I'd have preferred to buy the new Birds of Peru book instead, but the price was too high. The book is very heavy so be aware of that in your packing plans!"
3,not as good as the rest,"while this book is still good, it pales in comparison to the earlier books in the series. Too often Jordan draws out scenes that are useless, or he could do without. I found it almost unbearable to read at certain points because of boredom. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its good points, it does. But another complaint I have (about the series in whole, and particularly at the end of this book) is that Jordan seems afraid to take risks. The series is becoming very predictable, i wont reveal what happens at the end of the book, but it had potential to really shake up the plot and Jordan abandoned it very quickly. It seems that the main characters are invincible (save one certain woman back in book 5). In all, the book is decent. If you've been reading the series then you are undoubtably going to read this installment, but be warned that it in no way can compare to the greatness of The Eye of the World, and The Great Hunt. recommended"
4,Interesting pet peeves,"Lord of Chaos was an excellent continuation to the WOT series--exciting and entertaining--but if I have to read someone described as ""plump"" one more time, I might throw the book out of the window. It made me laugh to read other reviews in which people pointed out the things that I had noticed: his fixation with the word 'breasts', how horribly rude Nynaeve is without any reedeming qualities to her, and the strange relationship between men and women in Jordan's books. I'll keep on reading, of course. It's a nice way to pass the time."
5,what's with the lame romance covers?,"i really enjoyed this book except for one thing. those weak, soppy, romance covers have got to go. i envision rand and mat and perrin to look somewhat dark and intruiging, and instead the cover portrays a 'i can't believe it's not butter', hair flowing in the wind, shirt half buttoned to reveal hairy chest, day time soap opera star. i would prefer a plain black cover over these cheesy illustrations. (also, what's up with the cover on the great hunt? are those creatures sneaking up on loial and the others supposed to be trollocs? did the artist even read the book? these are supposed to be scary creatures, not some humans clad in armor. wack.)overall, the series is great. i've been buying the hardback versions of the books and i end up throwing the book jackets away because i hate to begin a story with a disapointing illustration."
3,Very Disappointed!,Jordan's world has so much potential that's why I am so disappointed about this book. I can't believe that these books average 800+ pages when the majority of the material is repeated and repeated. Jordan is fixated on making sure we know that Nynaeve likes to tug on her hair. That women can't agree on the amount of cleavage to show. That Aes Sedai are all knowing and the rest of civilization should just follow along. That all the women can't find a skirt that doesn't require straightening. How many more times must Jordan mention these ridiculous recurring themes? If I were to read one more time a phrase placing men in the idiocy category while women are ALWAYS right...I think I'll scream.Sorry Jordan but you lost me. Your plot lines are erratic and you have so many that you can't even remember them all. I'll read the remaining books if they're gifts. Jordan is milking this series for everything he can. Too bad TOR Fantasy can't see it.
3,It's getting long,When I started reading the Wheel of Time series I was very enthused about getting into a grand fantasy. I had read Tad Williams Memory Sorrow and Thorn along with Middle Earth and other such fantastic fare. I really enjoyed the first few books in this series as I read them all in row and was able to keep a fresh face on the series. Now it is starting to get to be awhile between books and looks as though he is just slowing down. I mean it take like 200 pages just to get through 1 day! Get it going and start releasing more than 1 book every 2 years and he may have something here. Please move the plot along!
3,"Not bad, but waaaaaaaaay toooooo lonnnnng","For the last threee books of the WoT I have found myself slugging through 700+ pages of nothing to get to the last 200 in which something actually happens. I am sick of how these characters fail to have the one aspect of reason that makes people humn---the ability to learn. I have investd 5000+ pages and $40+ so I will fifnish this series, if our lovely friend Bob ever can finish it. I find myself wondering who some of the character are sometimes, because we never hear from them (Perrin in Fires of Heaven, and Lan in this installment). Advice, from me. read this series, but when there are no quotes from the characters, just skim it. That way you do not read Jordan's repititious language too many times. The story is good, the idea is different, the writing is getting on my nerves. Is it just me, or is Bobby J. paid by the word???"
5,lord of chaos,"Robert Jordans works on the Wheel Of Time are very imaginative and totally engaging. His character development and plot twists, coupled with a great talent for story telling, make for hours of really enjoyable reading."
3,Waste of 900+ Pages,"I love the Wheel of Time Series. I have read it once and am now listening to it from the begining on CD. I find this book most tedious. It waste so much time and words. It could have been summed up in one very short book, been a continuation of the prior book, or the book to follow. It is much too wordy. A repeat of much of the same information and a ripoff of your money. Hopefully you can find it at a library. If you scan the book, find the little needed information to continue the series and go on to the next book, that is my recommendation."
2,Crappy scan,"I love this series. This book is not the best in the series - it's part of Jordan's mid-series slump.That doesn't entirely explain my low rating.This book is obviously an OCRed scan. Thom Merrilin regularly shows up as Thorn. Stern becomes stem. The first page begins with a stray > character. These aren't the only slip-ups. This doesn't make it unreadable, but they obviously didn't proof-read it after they scanned it, and did only minimal QA on the ebook conversion. For $10, I expect something with more production value than a random self-published novel. Tor cut a lot of corners on this."
4,loved it,"I've read reviews for the books that follow this one and I am hoping it's not as bad as they say, because I'm going to have to read them all. The world of the wheel of time series is so fascinating, and the customs and folkways of the people are so well thought-out, that I will be reading until the bitter end.This book I found to be excellent, I think I most enjoyed understanding the Aiel better. Interesting things happen around the Two Rivers Girls, and we get to spend time with Min and Perrin again."
2,6th in a series?! I hope the books get more interesting!,"I started reading ""the Wheel of Time"" books a long time ago; I think about 8 years ago. I stopped reading after the seventh, and recently started up again as I saw the release of the 9th book. I've read through all of them again, and now I see why I stopped.This book is almost, considering the last book and the constant references to the ancient prophecies of the Dragon, almost completely pointless. It has no purpose, nothing happens, nothing is really resolved. I can see Jordan sweating, trying to squeeze out another book in this already bloated series for the money.The last conflict in the story is pretty cool, but it takes about 400 pages of prolix, incredibly irritating ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" lolly-gagging to get there.If you want a better series, read Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Characters actually die! Things ACTUALLY HAPPEN! Best yet, he's promised us that the series is only going to be 6 books long, max."
2,A long series made seemingly endless with this book,"I began reading the series better than 6 years ago not knowing it was going to turn into a lifelong pursuit. Lord of Chaos, along with the preceding two books, suddenly began to drag. It's as if Robert Jordan only has 5 books worth of quality writing to put into this series but is under contract to put it into 10.I've been reading Chaos since it was released on paperback (who knows how long ago that has been) and I've yet to finish it. Will I? Probably, but only because I've invested too much time in reading the previous 5 and I'm curious to find out how this whole thing ends.My only hope is that the remaining books pick up the pace somewhat and eliminate a lot of unneccesary bland page filler."
1,It's a rough draft -- needs polish (I'm being kind),"You can't just sit down and type every single little thing that piles into your head. You have to write, then rewrite, rewrite, rewrite -- and rewrite some more. Otherwise you get the quicksand of this book, and the next one, and the one after that, and......Do you just hammer them out, then try on hats in front of the mirror, in between trimming and coiffing your moustache? How much money do you make from this series? Start earning it!And if Nynaeve tugs on her braid once more, I swear I'm going to throw this book into the driveway and run over it a few times. Tugging on your own hair hurts."
1,"Review, or Ad?","A piece of advice to surfers reading these reviews: a rave is one thing, but one that seems so worshipful of the text in question as to be nearly orgasmic should be highly suspect of being less a neutral review and more an advertisement submitted by paid employees of the publisher."
5,The best book in the definative fantasy series of our time,"The Wheel of Time is by far the Best Fantasy since the Lord Of the Rings, and Lord of Chaos is the best book in the series so far. With intricate plot twists and amazing cohesiveness Lord of Chaos follows a large cast and multiple storylines providing a continent spanning adventure.Robert Jordan's characters are well developed and complex, complete people with virtues, vices, merits, and flaws that make them real and interesting. The story is well crafted and captivating. DO NOT START THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE TO WORK IN THE MORNING."
2,Unoriginal mindless reading.,"This series maked me depressed.. My brother was enthralled with this series, and he convinced me to read them. When I was finished, the only consoling thought was that at I didn't pay for them. While the books are well writen, the plot leaves much to be desired, and gets worse as the books progress.How a author can write seven books based on such a unoriginal plot and cast of charactors is beyond me. Somehow it is not surprising that Mr Jordon also wrote a number of conan novels.You might as well be watching TV."
2,"""Is he doing this just for money?"" ""Probably""","I met a friend of mine a week ago. He had two moreWoT books for me to read. The reason I gave 3 issimple: Nothing ever happens.First there is nothing but endless scheming andplanning, and, quite frankly, I think mostof the characters are idiots. Why can't peopleever get together (Rand should be able to do that,200 Asha'man at your doorstep can be very convincing), and talk. Pedron Niall, for example,should have a long look and stop fooling around.And then there's the obligatory action part,inthe final chapter. I really, really hate that.And Rand has an annoying problem with dead Maidens, which is IMHO ridiculous. If youhave battle, you have casualties."
2,"When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Keep Buying","My cousin got me going on these, and I keep trying to convince him he's nuts. After six telephone books of nothingness, this series is like an EverReady bunny...it keeps going and going and going. Further and further into nothingness. Bring on the bad guys already and let's duke it out. I hate quitters, so I know I'll plow through the sequel--I forget just why"
2,Skip the first 900 pages,"The book has a good prologue, and the last 100 pages have a reasonable amount of action. The intervening 900 pages unfortunately are incredibly drawn out and boring.What makes it boring? Mostly endless posturing, maneuvering, and intrigue on the part of the characters, epitomized by the Aes Sedai ""sniff"" (every other page an Aes Sedai is sniffing--it gets old after a while). The intrigue is supposed to be complex, but the characters come across as sophisticated as a bunch of third-graders: petulant and whiny.I think that Robert Jordan has run out of steam and is simply milking the series for all the money that he can wring out of it."
3,"Hmmm...it feels like Stars Wars I, without the hype..","I JUST this minute finished reading this book. Took me most of a year to get through it.(and no, it wasn't me reading slow ;)Nothing, *NOTHING*, really interesting happens until pages 3-400.. I *REALLY* don't believe that this book should have been approx. 1000 pages, or that it took so long to get through it.I just got to page 150-250 and kept putting it down. THEN i said screw it, and it became a matter of prinicple, just to get further than i did before.I'm not exactly sure it was worth the weak ending. From page 500 on, i kept expecting the action to heighten, but the anticipation just leveled, and waned at the conclusion.But what am i complaining about? After i bought this many books from him, i'm in to the end of the story whether i like it or not ;)btw *yes* i'll get the rest, that's what i'm here for.. yo Robert, ez on the dialog bro, it's a bit much"
3,The Wheel starts missing some spokes,"Jordan has not lost the ability to create wonderful battle scenes or even tension in this book. However his inability to keep his plot lines from getting confused, or having simple too many characters, leaves the reader feeling cheated. The earlier books kept the Rand and Co. together and simplified the story. Now however with the main characters and their supporting caste blown to the four corners of this potentially great land, Jordan is struggling to keep his web intact. Introducing increasingly larger numbers of sub-plots and other characters makes the wheel of time look like a bad hollywood soap opera. I also feel that his constant need to divert to other books and projects while he is busy with this series doesn't help. Its time to focus on making this series better. I don't think Tolkien is in danger of loosing his crown."
3,All CDs were included,The discs were in their sleeves.... along with some residue that looked like someone spilled a malt on the discs and didn't wipe them off. The box was folded up and packed in the envelope. The residue in the CD cases became pulverized from the shipping and some CDs had residue on them or etching and had to clean the cds.All the discs were included.
4,Slow Story,"I have truly enjoyed the Wheel of Time series thus far. I have only read through this book. The series started a little slow but quickly gained momentum and kept it, until this book. The story is wonderful and I'm still excited about reading the rest of ther series, but Jordan really stretches the plot thin to get a fat book here. The last 100 to 150 pages cover much more story and moves much faster than the rest of the book. Had Jordan used this pacing, he could have told the same story in 400 pages instead of 700."
5,Solid Stuff,"Jordan has a tendency to exaggerate this weird struggle/dynamic between men and women. At some moments it can be so over the top, I suspect it's supposed to be campy. Is Jordan trying to appeal to young people or make fun of them? However, everything else in this book is solid stuff. It's just great fantasy."
5,How in the hell can anyone say anything bad about this book.,"The ending was spectacular, the new elements of the series that Jordan chose to reveal seem to be advancing the plot more than some readers think, and the story is VERY well writen. Anyone who thinks that the plot hasn't advanced to an acceptable degree is a damn moron."
4,Another good book by Jordan,I don't know what you people are saying when you write that this book sucks. It ain't great beyond belief but it does not suck. It is annoying how Jordan dropped Perrin (my favorite character) in the fires of heaven but it gets worse with the fact that Jordan picks him up agian then loses the ball. Arrrghh. Besides that Jordan really works on the ladies and Rands insanity. A good book overall.
1,Successfully put down a series,"I have at long last, managed to successfully quit reading a series. This is from somone who finished reading a Kevin J. Anderson series simply because I managed to make it through the first one (Sorry, Kevin, but you suck). The first 3 or so books were good reads, and I had made it through the fifth (I think) in about two weeks when I discovered something. This author is continuing to write books for money, and will drag this series along until he has wrung every last nickel out of it. There quite easily could be ten books to this series and frankly, I just can't make it. Reminds me of when Frank Herbert kept writing Dune novels simply because they kept throwing money at him. Terry Goodkind did a much better job with this type of story."
1,I only recommend this book to those I hate,"After 1000+ pages, can any reviewer honestly state this book is not a literary train-wreck. I tell you with a straight face that this book crippled my interest in fantasy, and for over a year after I threw it down in frustration (page 612), I was unable to pick up a fictional work - I was that frustrated. And now I return, years later, to provide the public service of berating this slog so that others might avoid the same agony."
2,I tried..I really did.,"Ok, to stop the naysayers in their tracks- I loved the first 4.5 books...but man...get on with the story! I have read these straight though (in 3 weeks) mabye that is my problem, but I dont think so. I love huge stories....James Clavell, Gary Jennings...couldn't get enough. However, these get very tedious, and I gave up. I hate to say it, because I pride myself on perserverance in these long books, but damn I cringed every time he repeated a phrase...not to mention, he used the same sentance over and over.If Nynavene ""tugs her braid"" again or of Elayne ""sniff's loudly""...I will be too young.If you like the idea, but want action...get Goodkinds ""Sword Of Truth"" series....much more readable..and not so plodding."
2,his worst,"Am I the only one who thinks Jordan hates women? Why are all his female characters so manipulative, competative, and controlling? His books tend to start by re-intoducing the characters (since you may not have seen them in 1000 pages), setting up things tediously for 500 pages, then concluding in an exciting finale that somehow makes you ready to trudge through the next one. For a lovely reduction of the plot (which is pretty cool) and better writing, see the myriad of Wheel of Time fan-webpages."
2,Give this a try,"Two things keep popping up in every negative review of any of the books in this series. One, everyone seems to think the books are too long, and for seemingly no purpose. Of course, Tolstoy makes Jordan look like a captionist for the New York Times, so remember, it could be worse. Two, everyone hates Jordan's women, especially Nynaeve. I can sympathize. So why not skip the female-bonding chapters? I have for the last three or so books and have discovered it's a much better read, and on top of that, I've discovered that it seems that what the women do (which really only amounts to whining about or bullying the men, anyway) is ultimately unessential to the plot. You will feel guilty the first few times you do this, but believe me, you'll be better off for it. And all those wonderful reviews! Sheesh! I can't imagine what they'd consider to be rubbish."
1,Save your money,"This review is for the casual fantasy novel reader, not teenage/young adult fanatics of the series.Okay, for all of you that have made it through the first five books and are wondering whether or not to continue, don't. The first four books are pretty solid work, well-developed and fun to read, if not a little long (where is his editor I wonder). But beginning in book 5 everything starts to slow way down. Book 6 is 900 pages and nothing happens. Even worse, the two stated goals at the beginning are not met by the end and it takes the author 100 pages in book seven to wrap things up. Finally, the characters are becoming less and less likeable in each novel, which makes you wonder what's the point?My advice is to read something by David Eddings or Terry Brooks, the true leaders in this field."
