1,It's fiction alright -- but not what I consider alright fiction.,"I have to confess that I didn't make it to the half way point through this book before I put it down for keeps. I found it difficult to stay with the story line mostly because of too many too obvious attempts to more than hint at real-life players and circumstances. It becomes tedious and distracting.If you dislike the aforementioned players passionately enough you'll probably enjoy the book -- though why anyone would pay for fiction on such a theme is beyond me to guess when you can get it for free from any of myriad print media and Internet websites. On the other hand, if you're just looking for good fiction, 'June, 2004' is not that."
3,"Pretty good examples, not as much for teaching","This was a decent book, it got you pretty much up to speed with the basics in the early chapters, but as the book progresses, it becomes mainly examples and explanations. The same code is rewritten again and again. I have this book and PHP Essentials. I think this book is PROBABLY worth buying AFTER you have read PHP Essentials, but Essentials is a far better introduction to PHP than this book is. I know the title is Professional PHP Programming, but some of the explanations of the sample code are criminally incomplete."
2,This book needed an editor.,"The book would explain PHP well if there weren't so many grammatical errors. The first few chapters were well worth reading, but about halfway through, stilted sentences and the incorrect use of ""which"" and ""that"" put me off the treatise entirely. I know that books of this ilk must be written hurriedly so the technology described in the book doesn't get a chance to change substantially before the book goes to market, but this is ridiculous. If I were shopping for a PHP book, I'd look seriously at some others."
2,Not good at all,"First of all, the book is very poorly written. The grammar, sentence structure are barely tolerable and makes the reading frustating to say the least. Second, this book is written by 5 different authors. AND IT SHOWS. In terms of content organization I would give the book a zero star. Third, most of the material covered is also found in the php online manual. Why would you want to look up a function in a book that has a terrible index when you can do a search/find on the online pdf manual?Fourth, the examples covered in the book have very little explanation to it. Fifth, too expensive."
2,Source not tested from the book,"The database examples where typed in by a non programmer (probably from the layout department). The php code did not match the sql given previously. So if you want to debug the examples that are supposed to teach you stuff, then have fun and spend some EXTRA TIME with this book. That time multiplied by the number of readers could have been SAVED by a better editor."
3,Convoluted althougth helpful,At times this book tends to go a little to in depth. Although theory is very interesting it is not the reason I bought this book. The setup chapter for Windows is lacking in detail and leaves parts out. The authors should have assumed that the reader knows nothing @ all. But when it comes down to the syntax this book is quite good.
3,Nice introduction but not very useful as a reference,"This book gives a nice overview of PHP and a few very useful real-world examples in the last chapter. The problem is, however, that once you start writing PHP code you need to look up certain functions and you won't find them all in the book (Perl style regular expression functions, for example)...Therefore, although it serves as a good introduction into the subject, there are other - less expensive - books out there for this purpose."
4,a solid foundation,"This Wrox book goes over the fundamentals of php for experienced programmers and covers all of the most used functions. As other reviewers have mentioned, it does not cover all functions; note, however, that it does not claim to be the definitive source for such a use. Used in conjunction with php.net, any programmer should be able to write php code easily after reading this book. The case studies between the chapters of the book and its appendices are a good way to see php in real life use."
5,one stop reference,I have been trying to develop a web-based tool to consolidate directory and mail services for our Intranet and this book has proved to be a boon. It has comprehensive coverage of PHP as a language and the chapters on LDAP and IMAP have been exhaustive and the example applications have been very useful. I have been seriously using PHP or attempting to for some time and I think this is by far the best book in the market on the subject.
1,Hodge Podge,"The book is ok for anecdotal reference. The overall quality of the code samples .. simply stinks.. several key examples simply don't work as published. As an owner of several Wrox press books, I was very disappointed with this one. The information available at web sites is much more valuable."
2,Out of Date,"It is out of date and so has some misleading information. Though the title says professional, it is really a beginner book. It is missing, among other things, a solid discussion of objects in PHP and discussion of sessions."
2,Terrible Book for a real world programming,This book might be worthwhile as a classroom workbook where you go through each and every chapter in order. As a book for somebody who wants to get things done this book is terrible. You have to wade through entire chapters to find what you want and the index is useless.For my real world projects I have never found what I wanted to know in this book. You are better off just looking at online documentation.It is also out of date and lacks coverage of sessions (there is a newer edition of the book that might include this but I am not going to buy it).
2,"Clearly, a book for beginners. Get the online docs.","As an experienced programmer, I found this book really frustrating. While it covers lots of other web-related subjects like SQL, LDAP, XML, etc., there's *no* reference manual, and no formal description of the language. If you have a very precise question (e.g.: how do you pass arguments by reference), you have to look at all the examples. Well, some useful information can be found, but you really have to look hard. What's more, the indexing is a joke.No, the title is a con. This is not a book for professionals. A more appropriate title would have been: ""Building Web-Enabled Applications for Beginners"" or something like that. It's not a bad book per se, but it is aimed at beginners and the title and the publisher's description fooled me into buying it.Experienced developers, stay away from this book!"
2,Too many holes,"While some of this book was helpful as a tutorial for someone new to PHP, there are far too many holes in the book and it is lousy as a reference manual. The index is terrible. To me a book like this must have a strong index or else it is useless. For example, I am working on a project that needs to determine the current date - a fairly common requirement. However, there is no entry in the index for dates or the PHP function getdate! I found the answer at the PHP website but that is what I bought this book for. This is just one example of the poor documentation in this book. There must be better ones."
4,It's okay but some mistakes are there,"The book is good but the first example i wanted to try out... i decided to download it from their site and when i tried to run the code it wont work. I had to change couple of lines and other things to make it work. It would be nice if they fix that code, at least on the site. I am using PHP 3.x.x on Apache. Otherwise its good, worth to buy."
4,Get this and the PHP 4 Bible,"Of all the PHP books I've seen, this one and the IDG ""PHP 4 Bible"". This one's more ""dense"", in that sort of Wroxy kind of British way. Both are fine choices."
4,Good book for PHP learners,"Its a good book. I did shopping cart example from this book, added some css stuff and database and presented to my professor"
5,A Designer's Must Read,"As a design student, I found this to be among the best design titles I have read to date. The book is inspiring, offering practical suggestions for adding sustainable principles to any design project. It is also eye-opening, exposing readers to successful design from a myriad of cultures. Papanak also explores the benefits of design education for everyone, and provides examples of successful design for every point he brings up. Every page seems to inspire a new design idea. This title is a must for every designer and design student."
1,Disjointed [stuff],This book is 1300 pages of [stuff]. Its written by about 10 people who obviously didn't look at each others segments because they repeat the same stuff over and over. If they took out all the information that was repeated throughout the book it would be about 300 pages. I was better served by the MSDN documentation. Wrox used to have a good reputation for solid books but it seems like quantity over quality is what they are after.
1,Too Much Theory,"The book, although SLAMMED with lots of info about WHY asp.net is useful & WHY you should use it, doesn't provide you with information on HOW to use it.The book doesn't seem like a useful tool for individuals making the transition from ASP to ASP.NET as far as providing useful examples & syntax reference.It's loaded with theory & overview information but provides little in the way of examples, syntax, & reference."
2,Very bad organization,This book a collection of disjoint chapters. Web Control section is really bad. Please do not waste your money on this book.
3,You'd think it would be more help,"I got this when it was basically the only book out there. Since then, whenever I have an ASP.NET problem I open this book, search vainly through the 1300 pages for coherent help, then give up and go to google groups. With all that writing you'd think that I would occasionally find my answers in there..."
5,Great book!,"This book is an excellent, in depth introduction to ASP.Net. I have been developing with Cold Fusion for a few years and dabbled with ASP. This book covers everything well without to much hand holding."
3,a book for asp.net with vb.net,this book does not offer a lot of c# code to explain .net. most of the code is vb.netIf someone is really interested in vb.net then this book is for him/her.
1,1300 pages of nothng,As another reviewer stated this book NEVER gets to the important topics. I found it useless.
3,Starr Faithfull,"A fictional twist of real diary of a real enigma of Starr Faithfull. This woman was found washed up on a beach in NY at the age of 25 in the 30's. She had obvoiusly drowned in shallow water, since a great deal of sand was supposed to have been found in her lungs. She was a real ornament of 20's nightlife, and had some issues to say the least. Including molestation (with the use of ether--""creamy dreamy"") and a rape by Uncle Andrew who was really mayor of Boston. Also a selfish money hungry mother, and an absent father. I don't know how believable Vanderbilt's vesion is, but I do know that Starr supposedly had a ""memory book"" that the press never saw. This book was good. Not the greatest, but a good read on a rainy day. I suppose the powers that be must have thought so also, since it was never released in paperback."
4,Fun!,"These boots are just plain fun. And they're good for the rain, too!One of the straps broke a few months after I started wearing them...but I think it was due to overzealous pulling than any faulty workmanship.If you like cows, then you can't turn these boots down."
5,Cow Rain Boots,"I LOVED these boots. I wish we could still get them in adult sizes. I haven't been able to find them, except in childrens sizes. They lasted long, were easy to get on and off and a little bit o' fun in the meantime. Chore time can get tedious at time.......why not make it fun with boots like this?"
4,Good for kids,"I bought this for my kids.Since they have very sensitive skin type.I prefer non-alcohol product.Mustela Musti Eau de Soin spray is very gentle.However, as other review already mentioned.Not too long to stay."
3,Smells like a baby,This alcohol free cologne smells like a baby and I loved it. Even my mother loved it. Very appropriate for warm weather. The only not so good part is that the scent wears away pretty fast.
2,Baby Cologne,Disappointing...especially after reading all the great reviews. I purchased it for my children. It does not smell light or baby at all. It smells very much like a man's cologne. It's very strong. It actually gave me a headache. Returning it for a refund.
1,Why would you use fragrance on a baby or child?!,"The ingredient ""fragrance"" is unregulated by the FDA, and therefore can contain any number of toxic, hormone disrupting, cancer causing chemicals. Please people, stop using products that contain synthetic fragrances on your children!"
5,I love this product!,"I am wearing this right now. And as soon as I run out of it, I will be ordering it again. Great scent, so soft and delicate. I use it all the time; sometimes I'll put it on before I go to sleep. It got some great reviews here on Amazon; I decided to try it and am very very glad I did. I hate to smell 'perfumed'. So this is perfect for me and for anyone who likes a soft scent that is not cloying and not sweet. Hard to describe, other than saying it's just perfect and light. It doesn't wear long, but that's fine with me. I just take it with me sometimes when I'll need it with me to refresh the scent."
2,The Aggressive State,"Really not into the Techno sound. I love the heavy guitars, but put off with the syntho-sounding junk. Much harder than Mental Floss, but really the same sounding beats. Travis Wyrick has an excellent voice, but for some reason is scared to let it out. I'm glad I only spent $1.50 on this CD - was hoping for so much more. I can see why Travis Wyrick only had 2 CD's out -they really don't display his musical talents. I was very disappointed with this CD."
2,Frustrating Experience,"I've been reading some of the other reviews on this page, and I can't believe they are reading the same book. I have had problems running the code in several of these exercises, particularly with any code that has the DataGrid control. I've also noticed I'm not the only with this problem, since I have browsed the Wrox website forums and found others who were having the same problems with the code. I even submitted code from Chapter 3, page 67 to Microsoft Support, after receiving nothing but a blank page when I ran it. Microsoft noticed that the code was MISSING a required clause! The exercise in question is the FIRST exercise in the book. If the first exercise you attempt fails even though you made no typos, it's frustrating. I can easily see a novice programmer getting discouraged and giving up. I'm an experienced ASP programmer and even I was getting fed up!I've been a big fan of other books by Wrox, but this one leaves a lot to be desired."
2,"Mostly ADO.NET, very little ASP.NET","I was very disappointed with this book. Yes, it's useful for understanding the new ADO.NET objects, but then keeps it's focus on RDBMS design instead of relating how to usefully implement ADO within an ASP.NET application, which is what I wanted."
3,"Direct, no-nonsense approach","What I liked most of this book is the plain, simple and direct approach to the different database access methods using ASP.NET with VB.NET. As an added bonus, at the end of each chapter there is a Common Mistakes sections that briefly discuss pitfall you can (and will) encounter trying out the topics discussed. And, gratefully, all the contributors (seven in total) follow the same discussion flow, unlike some of the others books from Wrox lately.Check out the great (and for me, undocumented) tip at the end of Chapter 3 on Configuration Settings, because that is worth the price of the book alone!Very well done that even newbies will be able to follow."
3,Some tracks did wipe out...,"Overall, I'd rate this CD medicore. This is because some tracks are really good, many are simply okay or downright bad. The Fluke, Underworld, Chem. Bros., and Leftfield songs are about the only ones I listen too anymore. The last track is by far the best on the CD, a really blasting jungle/drum n' bass style to it. The FSOL, photek, and other artists don't have good songs on this CD, so I say it really isn't worth buying just to get the good tracks, unless you really like the style of the FSOL, photek, and source direct tracks."
1,"Wow, what a piece of crap!","This CD is horrible. DO NOT BUY unless you like boring, repetativeness, with no melody, or anything that makes this appealing. I would honestly rather listen to random construction noises than expose my ears to this CD. I wish I could have my $4 back :( There are two good songs in the mix, one by prodigy, and the other IDK, but they do not offset the low quality of the rest of the compilation."
2,Not as good as the original,"Basicaly the only decent stuff I see here are tracks 1,4,7 and 8. Seven is the coolest theme ever - the one from the WipeoutXL game intro video(the whole reason I got this CD) and the first track is also mixed in there somewhere. Number 4 is just a more or less decent techno track, while 8 is Prodigy's ""Firestarter"" without the vocals. Track 2 was a dissapointing dulled-down version of Fluke's ""Atom Bomb""(I'd give the CD 4 stars if they just put the excellent original one). So there you have it, unless you desperatly want the WipeoutXL intro flick music which wasn't included on the game CD - don't bother. Better get the WipeoutXL game itself - it's out for PSX and PC and has the great game and music all in one(skip the first data track). You can also play the PSX version with an emulator and get the same resolution. But the PC version is the best."
5,Good. Need I say more?,"Kick ass cd. Excellent. Good trax by the future sound of London, Photek, PRodigy, Daft Punk, and the Chemical Brothers.Typically, various artists cds have 2 good songs, and other ones suck. Not this one. All of these were the first songs these talented artists wrote, which started off their carrer. Most certainly worth your 12 american dollars."
3,Not Pink!,"I like this collar and it looks great, but on the computer we thought it was a light pink. Its not. Its tan. They never said that anywhere so you should know."
2,This version is now outdated,"This version of the nutshell book is outdated. Look on Amazon for the more recent version, currently 2008:First Amendment in a Nutshell (Nutshell Series)"
3,Not What I thought!,"If you like ballet, and enjoy working out at a very ""relaxed"" level, this DVD is for you. If you like to ""feel the burn"" and enjoy motivation from your instructor, you will hate this DVD! The voice of the narrator could put me to sleep. I am so relaxed duriung this workout, that I forget what I am doing. On a more positive note, it is a complete ballet workout, and is easy to learn.(I have 10 years dance experience)I do, however, find it a bit too long. Don't bother with reviewing chapters on this one. The menu has sub-menus, and it's very easy to get lost in there. My suggestion: just push play and go with it! Good luck, and drink plenty of caffine before you enjoy this DVD!!!"
4,No need for a barre in ballet,"I am a ballet dancer and I want to clarify what one reviewer said about how this DVD is not worth it because it does not teach true barre work (since none of us have a barre in our homes). While ballet is often associated with having one hand on the barre at all times, the barre is actually supposed to be used for balance checks only, with your hand lightly resting on the barre. In fact, ideally none of us would use the barre because we all have great balance. I encourage anyone interested in this DVD to try it out and know that you do not need a barre to do pliés or anything else. You will actually have better balance and quicker results by not using a barre. Oh, and the best studio I've been taught at asked us to hardly use the barre at all (except when on pointe)."
2,I HATE IT,As a dancer I was looking for a video to help me improve my technique for fall auditions. If your even a slightly trained dancer pass on this video. The pictures on the back and front of the case do look complicated; but they're not IN the video. The video is hella easy. And i didn't feel the burn. Now if you have no dance experience then it might be different for you.
3,Not what I expected,"I thought that this would give me a ballet class at home, instead of at the studio, but it was more a aerobic workout than a ballet instructional video. They did a lot of ab crunches and leg lifts with a ballet twist. I was hoping for tondus, plies, grade ba maas, etc.Also the dancers in the video were beautiful, and muscular. Probably due to many, many years of dancing."
3,Not really a work out,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be a good addition to my current yoga and running program. I was hoping it would be filled with the toning exercises that I remember from ballet class, but I was very disappointed. I did not feel as though I got any real exercise from the class. For me there were too many dance sequences and not enough toning exercises. I returned the DVD."
3,Slow and more a stretching DVD than a ballet workout,"The exercises and narration are extremely slow. The stretches are OK. I expected more stretching exercises which would lead to better flexibility in ballet, such as how to improve Grand Battement or how to improve your Arabesque. I was a little disappointed."
4,Fun way to jazz up your workout regimen,"I have no dancing experience, but have enjoyed the challenge of this workout DVD. I find the dance number at the end of the stretches and exercises is a good cardio boost, though it won't compare to time on the treadmill. This is a good workout for toning and stretching. And fun!"
2,For completists only,"Most of these tracks are available elsewhere...and the main attraction (Setting Sun) isn't one of the Chem's better tracks in my opinion. So, picking up this EP only makes sense if you are trying to have a complete Chemical Brothers collection."
4,For collectors...,"This is a good CD, but I still prefer the live version of ""Setting Sun"" available on their ""Private Psychedelic Reel"" single..."
4,The Breakbeat Manifesto?,"Setting Sun is an awesome single but I suggest you get ""Dig Your Own Hole"" unless you are a Chembros completist."
5,cd rocks,I love this cd it has 4 songs only. #1 Setting Sun Full lengh #2 Setting Sun Radio Edit #3 Buzz Tracks #4 Setting Sun InstrumentalThis cd is great!
4,"Nice for Community Theater members, and Those Who Want to Be","The story narrated in this book is as familiar to me as the contents of my kitchen. I know the people, the situations, and what they are thinking. For me, this book serves as an affirmation of what I try to do every time I go on stage for an audition as an actor, open my stage manager's book as a production crew member, or stare at the S. French catalog trying to decide what play to do next as a producer/director. I would love to see a re-birth of community theater in this country, and this book explains a little about why. I recommend it to anyone who loves community theater, anyone who is a little bit of professional theater snob, and anyone who has been asked to become involved in their local community theater and doesn't understand what it is all about."
3,An Insider's Look,"As a community theater actor myself, I was intrigued by the whole premise of this book. In part it is historical development of community theater in [a part of] America. It is also an entertaining account of one troupe's efforts to put on what many consider a difficult and controversial play, 'M. Butterfly.' All in all a good read; some of the history is a little stale at times but interesting overall and the accounts of play production open such fun [and not so fun] memories from my own experiences."
1,Where did the guy learn to write?,"Having practiced digital logic design in its many forms (from basic digital implementations to VHDL), over a period of 20+ years, I must state that this is possibly the most poorly written text I have ever seen on the discipline."
5,A superb introduction to digital logic,"Having examined numerous books that cover introductory material on digital logic, I must say that this book is a welcome addition. Indeed, I would consider this book the best among the currently avaialabe books on this subject. The treatment emphasizes the fundamentals very well without an emphasis on the tecnhology or on any design language. Thus, the material covered should be helpful in giving the students a strong and lasting foundation which will be independent of changes in technology. The presentation is lucid, and the examples are very good.I believe this should be a serious candidate for the text book of any introductory course in digital logic."
2,One of the worse book I've ever seen.,"This book was used for my 'Digital Logic and Design' course at Stony Brook University, NY. This book has non-sense, low quality examples and lack of explanation. I had to buy another different(better) book to study. This Book have some exercise questions at the end of each chapters which are unrelated to the subject. You won't be able to understand and solve the questions unless you reference to another book.A bad introduction book for Digital logic."
4,Cute,"I thought this movie was so cute and romantic!! There were some little elements of magic in it which made it even nicer. I don't know how many people have seen this movie, but it's really nice!"
2,Just ok,"I had seen this movie before, and appreciated the concept that two people could communicate on a level that transcended speech - but it was an off beat, odd storyline that takes the right mood/frame of mind to appreciate."
1,What kind of parents?,"I purchased this cookbook because I have a young child and a picky husband. I was thrilled to find something I could use so dinner time and bedtime were a ways apart. Well, when I got this book, I was very disappointed. I cannot pronounce half of the ingredients and what I can pronounce, I cannot afford to purchase. Aparantly, working parents means doctors and lawyers who have kids. Because no one in my income bracket could ever use these recipes. Plus the recipes I thought I might be able to pull off, both of my eaters turned their nose just to the name and what it was. To me, that's not very kid friendly."
2,Too many mistakes,"I am a complete newcomer to HTML, and I am very disappointed in this book. The book starts off pretty well, and really captivated me, but then in their own examples, the authors start violating the principles they set forth. For instance, in the chapter on tables, the authors state that the thead, tfoot, and tbody elements have to appear in that order, but then in subsequent examples the authors employ those elements in a different order, and my browser (IE5) didn't seem to mind. When you couple this problem with the numerous typographical errors and poor editing overall, the book becomes confusing as to what is proper form for XHTML, and becomes an ineffective guide. The different sections of the book are obviously written by different people as they do not fit together very well, sometimes repeating things in previous sections, or not illustrating the relevance of the point at hand. I intend to buy another XHTML book and start over."
4,Good Trainer MP3,Got this for my little brother who is 11 it's a good step up from his portable CD player but a lot less exspensive than an Ipod. The software and controles are pretty basic and I had him ripping and listining to music in about an hour. If your looking for a good middle man for kids that want somthing high tech but are to young to really take care of somthing super exspensive than this is a good choice.
5,Amazingly long life...,"I've had this mp3 player for a while now, since I was 18 and I am 21. It's lasted me all these years and I think that's amazing. I've attempted to purchase other mp3 players but I always end using my little buddy in the end. It's been through some tough situations, with me dropping it on the floor by accident at my job several times over the years. I now have to keep it together with a piece of tape but it still works the same as the day I got it. So, I would definitely recommend this cute lil' thing to anyone who has a passion for music and for someone who has a short playlist. I personally use it when I'm cleaning house. So, totally recommended! ^_^"
3,Where's the bass?,I WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THE SOUND COMING FROM THIS LITTLE BLUE BOX. ALL HIGHS AND MID RANGE BUT NOT MUCH BASS AT ALL. EVEN WHILE WEARING MY $70. SENNHEISER NOISE REDUCTION HEADPHONES. BUT I WILL SAY I LIKE THE EASE OF OPERATION. ALSO WHY DOES THE LCD DISPLAY ONLY NAMES THE SONGS THAT'S PLAYING AND NOT THE ARTISTS? THIS IS MY 2ND MP3 PLAYER. IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE BUYING A THIRD ONE SOON.
4,Almost perfect mp3,Its relly good but the price its a litle to high in comparison to others MP3 players. But have a good radio and microphone.
3,Get the originals,"First of all let me just state for the record that Gang of Four is one the greatest bands of any era, in any genre. As Michael Stipe put it, ""Entertainment (Go4's first album) shredded everything that came before it.""The absolutely must have Gang of Four CD is the Entertainment release on American that includes the yellow EP. They got *most* of the good stuff on this, but I can't live without ""Outside the Trains Don't Run on Time"" and the missing tracks from Entertainment.BTW, it sure is cool they got Hugo Burnham's comments up here. I'm a drummer and Hugo changed my life. Nice job Amazon."
4,I LOVE A MAN IN A UNIFORM!,Underrated group from the late 70s have their best song showcased here in a nice remix. Fate is not fair; these guys should have been idols.
2,Chinese compressor motor,This should have been a good compressor. However with about 40 hours on it the compressor motor dropped a broken retaining ring into the cylinder damaging a piston and scoring the head and sidewall. Apparently a few years ago the US made compressor motor was replaced with a Chinese one. For the failure of a 15 cent part it cost me over $100 in parts to repair. After fixing the compressor motor the relief valve failed which cost me more money. Thouroughly disatisfied with this Dewalt compressor. Highly unreliable and built using cheap imported parts.
1,"Ripoff Packaging, Good Music","This Lost Texas Tapes series is a ripoff. There is only 25-30 minutes' worth of music on each CD. This whole collection could fit on 2 discs, but it's been spread out over 5 separate discs which are being sold separately for the cost of five full-length CD's. There is good music here, but I can't recommend buying it at retail price to anyone. If you're just getting into Lightnin' Hopkins, look at some of the other multi-disc collections first as a better starting point. Anyone who really wants these specific recordings should start looking for secondhand copies or see if they're available on other releases."
5,Magdalene Sisters,"I have seen this movie and it is brilliant! The movie is based on a true story. Set in Ireland, it takes place in a home run by nuns, for unwed mothers to be, in the 60's. I would love to watch it again, but, I bought it here on Amazon, by a seller named Chuggo, and I paid for it on December 10th when he claimed to have shipped it. It was a present for my Daughter for Christmas. He did not send the DVD, or refund my money. I had to file a complaint with Amazon. Many other people have the same complaint in his ratings. Do your selves a favor and do not buy off of Chuggo. This seller is awful and rude! Buyer beware! This seller also goes by the name of "": Discount Processing "". He has very bad ratings.."
5,Excellent Movie and Cast,"Excellent movie, content and cast. This movie's account of life inside a Magdalene Laundry, one of the dismal asylums for ""wayward women"" run by the Catholic Church in Ireland was riveting and enlightening. A definite MUST SEE!"
4,Outrageous Regulations,This movie is an excellent true life video as to how pregnant girls were treated with shame and isolation from the world. The cruelty in the name of reforming them as bad girls was horrible to view.
1,Magdalene Sisters,"This was an extraordinary, stunning movie based on true events! It is almost unbelievable what these young women went through in payment of their 'sins' in the eyes of the Catholic Church and their families. How brave the three girls profiled in the film were that finally brought this injustice to an end!"
5,Shocking,"The movie is a shocking, depressing movie, but it's a great movie. Great acting. The gritty filming style adds to the feel of the movie. Makes you look at the Catholic church."
5,Movie Collection,"Rented the movie and it was a must have. Very moving, informative and profound. Excellent performances. I don't know how I missed this one. Will watch at the next ""movie and popcorn night"" with my friends."
3,"Why did this go on so long, in real life?","Very well acted, entirely believable (as it should be, since it based on real events) and great character development. Some of the plot was a bit predictable (it was easy to guess who would come to a bad end, and who would make it out) but the story was compelling. It's tragic and discouraging that this cruel and degrading system was allowed to go on until 1996--where were the laws to protect women from involuntary and unpaid servitude!? The young actresses each did an excellent job in portraying damaged young women of an earlier time."
2,Rudimentary instruction,"I bought this book because I was looking for instructions on brush calligraphy and lettering. I practically found none (there are only two pages devoted to the subject with very little information, no drills, no exercises.) The section on pen calligraphy is very basic, too. I would only recommend this book to absolute beginners, or maybe not even to them. There are plenty of copyright-free books about penmanship online."
1,Warning - Item Labeled Wrong,"Be aware that this probe pack doesn't fit the Petsafe PIF-275-19 Wireless Radio Collar, even though it ""implies that it does.""Just under item's description there is a section, ""Frequently Bought Together."" This has the PIF 275 in that section suggesting they can be bought together. It's obviously an over site and only a $3 one at that but it's not worth the effort....The black plastic plates that fit under the probes are NOT SLANTED like the PIF-275 requires. I hope this helps someone not to make the same mistake. I wish someone had put this in the reviews earlier."
3,No battery screws,I was hoping to find the screws to hold the back of the battery case. Had to purchase the screws separately
3,probe not the size of the collar,package of collar probes. The package contained smaller probes than was on my dog's collar however one of the smaller probes did work.
3,"Got what I ordered, but it wasn't what I thought.","It was not what I was hoping for. The probes were longer than the original probes, but not near long enough to get through the fur on my chow. So, we will not be able to use the new probes because they do not reach. I got what I ordered, but since they were not long enough (like I assumed they would be from the description) they are useless."
5,petsafe works,I needed new probes for the pet safe collar and I didn't have long to wait to get it. Thanks for helping to keep my pets safe.
4,Much more than just a cookbook!,"Don't buy this book if all you are looking for is a cookbook -- it's much, much more. In fact, you'll probably love this book even if all you ever make for dinner is reservations!It's a glimpse inside the country music industry, a chronicle of the lives of three fascinating women and most of all a celebration of family love -- no matter what shape or size that family may come in.I read it in one late night sitting and at the end felt compelled to go hug my sleeping children. I wish I could have hugged the young Naomi; mother of two, husbandless, jobless, but plenty gutsy.The book is attractively bound, with dozens of glorious full color photographs, and makes a lovely gift. I gave a copy to my mother, not much of a county music fan, and she enjoyed it as much as I did."
5,wonderfull cookbook-biography!,A great book that you will not only enjoy cooking from but just reading. Naomi Judd opens her heart and photo album to make this much more than a cookbook. Five stars for Naomi Judd!
4,For Your Noisy Neighbors,"This is a great, crashing, banging CD. It's not all noise however, there are some real toe tappers on this album. The Mantronic mix is the best."
4,Thanks Larry.,"I have been looking for this CD for a few years. A buddy (Larry) gave me a tape of this CD about 7 years ago. Now I don't have a tape player in my car anymore. I was so happy to see this on Amazon. And of course it's much crisper on CD. A different side of Neil. I'm sure it's not for everybody. When I first got the tape I was not sure I liked it but it quickly grew on me. That's why had to replace it. So It's a ""Must Have"" for me anyway."
3,Neil's blues are solid but not truly moving,"This disc is an interesting aside from Neil Young -- who has recorded quite a few interesting asides amid all his great work! On this one, Neil does the blues, but I would have preferred him to strip them down and make them haunting -- sort of a blues version of ""Harvest,"" perhaps, with more acoustic layers. Instead, this is pretty slick stuff, though ""Ten Men Workin' "" grooves along pretty well. If you really want to hear Neil Young's blues album, that's easy: Just buy ""Tonight's the Night."" As he once said of one of his songs, that album is out of pitch but still in tune, as Young wears his pain on his sleeve following the death of original Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten -- and a roadie, I think, named Bruce Berry, if memory serves. Feel free to correct me on the name, but if you knock the album itself, them's fightin' words."
4,weirdo,"During the 80's Young experimented a lot, partly to get rid of his label perhaps. Experimentation is better than copying yourself all over again (which Young does now, it seems) but it does't always work. In this case, however, it worsk brilliantly. Great songs, excellent performances and a moody atmosphere that really sets this record apart from most of his other work. Not for newbies perhaps, but a great listen!"
3,Neil hammers the blues,"The last (thankfully!) in a long succession of stylistic detours for Neil Young in the 1980s, the blues-themed ""This Note's For You"" is actually one of his better albums from that decade. Not to say its great (the album that followed, ""Freedom,"" is an absolute classic), but the songwriting is much improved (certainly from his new wave stinker, ""Landing on Water"") and some of the songs will not sound out of place whenever Neil gets around to finishing his long-promised box set. ""Ten Men Workin'"" and ""This Note's for You"" are the highlights, but overall this is not a bad album."
2,Also think it's too tight,"I also found the product too tight. Specifically, it seems very narrow at the back whereas there is still more than enough space in front of my big toe. I found the tongue pinching the top of my foot as I walked. I only bought online, so maybe it would've helped to try on a slightly larger size in-store."
3,Great price. Not very comfortable.,"These shoes look great for the price but don't fit comfortably. These were pretty tight when I first tried them on, even though the size I ordered was the right one. I am hoping they will loosen up with more use. If you are considering buying these, order a slightly larger size than you normally would, and that might work out."
4,All Hyped Up,"This is a pretty damn good mix,well at least on the first cd,which is very upbeat and energetic.The second one,I dont really care for because it's way to soft for my tastes.Hyper has proved that he's one of the best breaks dj's in the buisness,if you like dance music,then go get ""Wired"""
5,Marvelous,"This camera w/ accessories is great for the price. It is so good, my son is using it in his film class!"
5,Vivid and a pleasure!!!,"""The Rise and Fall..."" is a fantastic read! I'm kind of a slow reader, so it totally disrupted my life for, like, a whole week. I was reading it in the car, at work, under the covers with a headlamp... Mimi is a wonderful narrator, who tells it like it is, but with all the necessary embellishments! I love the way she describes scenes that are so over the top they seem like pure fiction, and then slips in details--like the blue-gray curls on the salon floor where Mimi gets her makeover--that bring us back to a reality we all know and love. The characters in Mimi's life are completely delicious, and run the gamut from cartoons to carefully-rendered 3-D personalities. I would recommend this book to anyone, teen and adult readers alike. Congratulations to the authors--hope you're working hard on the next, cuz your fans are waiting!"
4,Loved this book,"When i first purchased the book ""The Rise and Fall of a 10th Grade Social Climber"" i got it because of the cover. At first i thought the book was slow and boring until i got to the middle of it. Mim's desire to become one of the popular girls at the Baldwin school drives her to do many crazy things. She gets a fake id, tries pot and cigarets, goes to trump tower and her friendship with her childhood best friend is tested. She also keeps a diary to write about the popular girls in. She learns that writing about your friends is never a good thing. This book tought me to always be honest and true to your friends because in the end, your true friends will stick by your side."
2,Disappointing - could be better,"Great to get an official release of turntablist/battle type of DJ work. However, the selection on this CD does not represent the best live sets of the DJs featured. For instance, DJ Static from Denmark, is excellent at dissing his opponents in DJ battles using his phrasing style but his cut on this CD is no way near his best routines he does at DJ battles such as ITF.Overall, a decent CD, however the selection of DJ tracks could have been more carefully made and why not fill up whole 74 min of the CDs? For funky phresh scratching, get the Pharaohs of Funk CD or mixtapes/CDs by DJs themselves."
5,Ozzie FUNtastic!!!!,"Wow, i love this CD! Who knew Australians could make such great music???I'm a big fan of Siobhan Fahey,Goldfrapp and Royksopp and this band fuses lots of elements from those electro delicious bands and adds a splash of rock!This CD is aboundant with electronic beats with a slight retro feel, with great basslines and of course great male vocals that make this a MUST BUY for all contemporary electronic music fans.This special version with the extra Remix CD is well worth it,it has awesome additional remixes to play on your stereo full blast.This band gives me hope that great electronic/pop acts still exist nowadays and produce fresh beats and hypnotic electo songs."
3,Impressive for Electro Pop,"I have to admit, this album is a lot better than I expected. If you enjoy really cathy & energetic electro, I'd recommend checking this out. It's nothing to give 4 or 5 stars (in my opinion) but I'm glad I bought it. My favorite tracks are Better World, The Careless Kind, Girls Can Be Cruel and Natural. A few others are pretty good, too. My main complaint is that some of the instrumental tracks get too repetitive. If they learn how to keep the variety constant throughout the whole album and avoid annoying repetition, they can become a truly incredible band. No doubt."
4,Once you've seen them live...,"You might not like this album, but as a whole Infusion is a forward thinking, innovative, FUN group of electronic music makers. Alas, once you have seen them live (as ALL of it - including vocals is live) it's hard to listen to them in your car. All in all a good show of some easy listening rock-tronicaMaybe their next album will really be inspired!"
4,and im not even into electronica,"ok im not usually into this type of music - im more of a rock, indie, alternative girl. however i saw these guys in concert and it was amazing - i didn't know any of their songs and i found myself dancing crazily to them. this prompted me to get their CD - i wasnt disappointed! even if you're not really into electronica/dance type music its worth checking this band out - i like their album, especially the songs 'girls can be cruel', 'better world' and 'the careless kind'."
3,Phil Collins? Hokey smokes. This guy isn't your usual popstar. Listen if you don't believe me.,Cannot believe this is phil collins. Odd time signatures and primative synthisizer voicings make this a rare treat. Phil actually sings on one track. Not for the simple.
4,"Good, but why is the surface sticky/tacky?","The cord is sturdy and the coil is staying nice and tight. However, the surface has a strange tacky feel."
5,heartfelt Celtic sounds,"This album is one of Smithfield Fair's best. It is a beautiful mix of traditional Scottish songs and more modern pieces with a timeless feel. Jan's voice is heart-breakingly beautiful here, as is the instrumental work. Frang's percussion abilities particularly shine in ""The Pretender Will Cam Nae More"" and Dudley-Brian's ""The Giant's Dance"" never fails to stir a sense of wonder. Now that this group is part of my musical life, I can't imagine Celtic music without them."
4,The author has done the hard work for you!,"The author brilliantly collates what must amount to a seemingly infinite amount of material. Terms are clearly explained and chapters follow a coherent path, allbeit to a conclusion (minus one star) that wasn't expected... but the journey was well worth it!Short case studies and examples are easy to skip over but good to see them. The content is deep enough for a University audience and at a reasonable length to link to practical applications as well as leave your mind tinkering. It is a first-time theoretical read and a stepping-stone to broader material as it impartially outlines the arguments for and against each theory.In the end you are forced to decide for yourself! For the moment I have made my mind up on the theoretical side - how about you? In hindsight the decision to get this title was very easy."
5,Recommand for oily skin,Didnt get a chance it use it this time. I have used it before and it works great if u get acne bcoz of oily skin. If ur skin is dry dont use it.
4,Too Loud!,"I bought this dryer because I had an ancient Dazey Hood Dryer that finally died. I was looking for something that wouldn't take forever to dry my hair because it is long, thick and course and the old dryer took 2 hours. The Revlon caught my eye with the ION feature. I took it out of the box and immediately liked it because it was lightweight and easy to set up. I liked everything about it until I turned it on....WOW...very loud and shrill! Like a blow dryer on high. If you can put up with the noise, it dries great. It took an hour less..but gave me a headache!"
1,FLIMSY PIECE OF JUNK,"DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS -- JUST FLUSH YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET INSTEAD. THIS IS A CHEAP, LIGHTWEIGHT PIECE OF JUNK THAT DOES NOT HEAT WELL. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE."
3,"Covers a lot of information, with poor illustrations.","This book covers virtually every aspect of climbing, from rock gear to avalanche detection and rescue. While it's all inclusive, the drawings (there are no photos) are poor, a significant drawback in a book like this. A lot of the things that he writes about snow and ice get very technical, especially when he discusses snowpack, ice formations, etc., which, if you have the patience to read all the way through, are pretty interesting. I'd buy John Long's book from the How to Rock Climb series first hands down, but this one is a good book to have nonetheless."
1,Bad Design,"This book is a real stinker. I finally abandoned it on page 108 (of 289) because I couldn't stand it any longer. The characters, all of them, are so over the top (Aunt Fern?) as to be annoying. The best satire has a note of realism; there is nothing, absolutely nothing, realistic in this story. The author, Jon P. Bloch, evidently teaches at the world-renowned Southern Connecticut State University. It should be back to school for you, prof."
5,Better Than The Real Thing,"Bloch's take on the tv show ""Trading Spaces"" makes is clear that he should be producing the actual program on TLC. Reading this book is more fun than a ""Trading Spaces"" marathon. His sly characterizations of the designers are spot on target. And the room designs, though funny and over-the-top, are no more outrageous than some of the actual designs on the show.The murder and the mystery work well for me. I had no idea whodunnit - and it was a fun time finding out. I prefer comic mysteries that make me laugh over edge-of-the-seat mysteries - which never keep me on the edge of my seat. This one made me laugh out loud at least once in each chapter - that's a good average!Definitely give this one a try!"
5,pure is best for animals!,"I always look for powder form in supplements, when shopping for my cats. The reason: no unnecessary additives.Taurine is a necessary addition to all home-cooked cat food, so powder is the way to go & I'm happy I found this on Amazon"
4,for my nerves,"I like taurine seems to put a protective coating around my nervous,and it seems to help with some of my health problems."
1,"Overpriced, poor quality, bad warranty","Couldn't find the bag I wanted at Wilson Leather (great value briefcases), so I bought this bag instead. The shoulder strap seam separated and the strap was not usable. Samsonite would not exchange it or fix it and I was told that they didn't warranty the bag and that I had to send it back to the manufacturer. They did offer to take the bag back if I bought another bag for 20% off. Pay for 2 bags and get 1? I don't think so. I had the bag resewn at a shoe repair store. The bag is poor quality - it has no structure to it. I could buy a similar quality bag for half the price. Stay away from Samsonite bags. Buy from Wilson leather - I have for 20 years. Too bad they didn't have my style case."
3,Good bag - could be better!,"The bag comes close to meeting the promise it held for me when I ordered it.Pros:1. Has tons of space, pockets etc.2. The front of the bag has good quality leather - thick & rich.3. Looks good.Cons:1. The leather on the back of the bag is made of thin leather - not the thick rich leather that makes the front.2. In any case, I do not think it is full grain.Overall, am happy for the price I paid for it (139$)- remains to be seen how long it lasts."
1,Not up to snuff for Pachmyer,Dealer service and delivery was top rate but the quality of the product was below the quality standard I had come to expect from Pachmyer.The fit was loose even though the factory installation instructions were followed to the word. The factory grip on the Ruger SP-101 is a much better grip. Don't waste your money on this one!
2,They are going back... :(,"These boots are extremely narrow, I have narrow feet but these are still impossible for me to keep. Also the shaft is too big, I guess it's because I have skinny calves. Plus there is no cushion on the footbed, I only walk on the carpet at home but they are already not comfortable to walk at all. The 2 stars are for the looks. I am sending them back right away."
3,"Not Bad, but not what I was looking for...","FSOL is an amazing band with a lot of clot. I would still try to get into this album, but I wasn't feeling it when I got it. I was actually looking for a song they did, that mixed an female Opera singer with techno. I still don't know what song that is..."
5,Sounds that Cascade through your mind...,"this ep collection of various versions of The Future Sound of London's amazing soundscape known as Cascade is, simply put: unbelievable. ambient backdrops...driving beats...swimming, pulsating synth...eerie trance-like soundscapes...there is literally sound all around...enveloping you. the music will, without a doubt, take you somewhere very far away. i can't put it into words too well...it's not easy...one has to listen to this 6 song ep to really understand and appreciate what's going on here.Cascade is wonderful...it is an amazing feast for your auditory senses...it will carry you somewhere every time. what a treat. thank you Future Sound of London!!!peace,cic"
3,"interesting, but slightly dated","The Eartha travelog is a beautiful and well-put together book. It provides great tidbits of information about many diverse locales, however, the majority of the geopolitical information is totally dated."
1,Superficial Research and Inaccurate Citation of Facts,"I reviewed material related to William Pitt Kellogg, about whom I am writing a biography. I expected the entry about WPK to be brief, but was surprised at the number of inaccuracies on which the entry relied. A few: WPK was not succeeded by his nephew William Kellogg on the Nebraska Supreme Court. William Kellogg was a distant cousin who was older than WPK. WPK saw military action, contrary to this arcticle. WPK was in fact appointed Collector of the Port of New Orleans by Lincoln--he signed the commission before heading to Ford's Theater that night. Technically he was impeached by the Louisiana legislature, but was acquitted the same day. The papers of the impeachment have not ""disappeared""--they are available at LSU in Baton Rouge. There are other mistakes, too, but you get the idea."
4,Nice smoky torches to keep the mosquitoes away,These torches look really great in a pail of sand and really keep the mosquitoes away.
5,u.s. bm at it's finest,this album is seemless fron xasthur to leviathan. there are two natable songs on this disc that are covers( and damn good ones at that).i do believe the first one is achieve emptieness by katatonia and covered by xasthur(don't quote me but amazon doesn't list all album info so i may have the wrong song)and the second and most notable track is where the winter beats incessant by judas iscariot and covered by leviathan. this is grim cold and raw black metal for only true fans.
2,interesting but...,"such a small book for such a big price, if you at all interested in spacecraft propulsion you are sure know all but the equations in this book, it is informative, but only if you are completely ignorant of how spacecraft move through space, i like this book, but its too pricey for what you get."
3,Weak Reflection,"Ain Soph may have been ""for fans of Caravan, Camel & Soft Machine"" but frankly they never approached the same level of achievement. Their songs tended to fall into repeating patterns and predictable progressions all too frequently, with little in the way of hummable melodies. Although they're all excellent musicians they didn't seem to push the envelope, being content to put out rather dishwatery imitations of the English bands."
4,For Better Forever,This book is a great tool for any married couple. If you think you have a good marriage ... this book can help you make it better. If your marriage isn't so good ... you can improve your marriage if you are willing to be extrememly honest with yourself and you are willing to work to improve your marriage.
5,Great Book,Great guideline to improve all aspects of your marriage...Highly recommend it if you want to have a Christ-centered lifelong marriage.
2,Title confused,"I was actually looking for material titled ""For Better & Forever"" by another author - which is recommended by numerous Dioceses. The closeness of the titles confused me into buying this book. I can understand now why it is a best seller. Will keep it for a reference"
5,Wishbone is a Classic,My children love Wishbone! I enjoy the stories as well and like the fact that some of the classic tales are inroduced to kids in a way that they will be interested in. Great programming.
3,OK.,"This is just someones version of this general,history is decided by the ones who win the war, so the real truth no one wants to know!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"The packaging was horrible for a start! The item came in a pakaging bag which totally destroyed the product box. The pillow is tiny and it is not comfortable at all. Its purpose seems to be just for a decoration I guess. Anyways, I was most upset that the product was damaged so I sent it back for a refund."
3,Hood Rich...It was JUST O.K.,I was expecting it to be better than what it really was. This story is mostly about the struggles a young man face while being wrongly convicted of a crime he did not do. So most of the storyline deals with the main character being behind bars. There were a lot of twist in the storylines which held my attention and made the book an OK read. There is a part II to this book and I will be starting it next. Hopefully it will be better than part I.
5,Best Best Book I've Ever Read,"My hat comes off to this bad ass sista. Essence Best Selling Author Winston Chatman said it best when he said that Crystal Stell is the Hottest New Chick in the Game. Hood Rich is the bomb. One sitting, no disturbances, all day long I read this book from cover to cover. You go Gurl cause if you aint a bestseller you will be soon.Leslie"
5,This Sis Is The Truth,"Hood Rich was off the chain. It grabbed me and I was hooked. Me and my dawgs agree that's it's one of the best hood books being slung right now. We need to infest the block, the schools and the prisons with this book. Everybody on Tripple Crown's tip, but on the real they can't F#^$ with this little lady. Keep doing you sis and grind-n, Hood Rich gon take off, you gon be paid, and I'm gon want to make yo fine A$$ my woman."
5,MasterCook is an excellent program...,I am a housewife and I also have a small catering service. I received this at my wedding shower a few weeks ago. I was very disorganized and often could not find the recipe I was looking for among my stacks of cookbooks and recipe boxes. I still mostly use my own recipes but this has been good for organizing my things and I have found some dishes in here that I really like to make at home. I definitely recommend this product for anyone.
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed to learn that this product will not work on Windows XP. As I looked into the matter, I discovered that Sierra is discontinuing their MasterCook line. Very disappointing."
1,OUTDATED!,Product is so outdated it wouldn't even load on my computer!!! Waste of money. Would not recommend for anyone looking for a good recipe product.
1,A major disappointment/for bean counters only!,"If the writer wanted to explain how big the Pacific Ocean is, he go on to describe how many drops of water it had and then gives the molecule content, or if this author has PhDs, then reader has to have one too, or ESP. in order to understand it. This book is a rip off and shouldn't be passed off as a history book for the casual reader or the history buff. Now I have to buy another book to find out what happen in The Battle of Leyte Gulf. The logistical accounting in the first 3 (57pages) chapters should've been foot notes in the back of the book. This is what bean counters do for a living. He could've said the Japanese were out of fuel, ammo, supplies and all their air force had been shot out of the sky. I simply couldn't understand what I was reading. If the author H.P. Willimont thinks I would read one of his other 21 books, I'd rather read a phone book."
5,An Important Scholarly Work,H.P. Willmott has once again produced an important addition to the literature of the Second World War. His attention to historical detail combined with a compelling narrative - hallmarks of his previous works as well - make this an essential read for anyone interested in military history.
1,Terrible book,"The author of this book seems to be obsessed with trivial details that nobody is interested in. Also, the vocabulary takes a dictionary to figure out what he is talking about. Horrible book."
4,Search the Seven Hills: The Quirinal Affair,"Another interesting, well researched book by Barbara Hambly, especially if you're interested in ancient Rome.I did find the misspelling and lack of punctuation annoying through the earlier part of the ebook. It seemed to have disappeared in the later chapters!? Is this sort of thing related to the way the ebook is copied or scanned? Really annoying. Never saw this in print books of hers!"
4,Sports cassette walkman,No longer available new in box. Machines are now overstocks or refurbs. Model performs respectibly but is no where close in sound quality to a AC powerewd unit.
3,If you like Jiu-itsu,"You will enjoy this dvd. I was hoping for more behind the scenes features with competitor interviews etc... But the meat is the matches and there is plenty of meat, just don't expect any side dishes."
2,Somewhat useful but frustrating,"This book has lots of useful technical information and the authors know their subject well. The book however, isn't well suited for those of us who like learning by hands-on examples and/or appreciate the quick start approach. Though Biztalk is a messaging product, I'm on chapter 5, page 256, and the authors haven't yet used an example that has sent a single message. So far the book is based on one main example that attemps to cover too many points. Unfortunately the example has typos and doesn't compile - even using the downloaded code. It would be much more effective to start with a couple of ""Hello World"" like examples to quickly illustrate the product functionality."
3,Still Worthwhile,"I realize a newer version of BizTalk is available and that the underlying technology has changed significantly (most notably the change in orchestration languages). However, I suspect there are many of you still out there who, like myself, must continue to work with older BizTalk implementations.For those of you, I would like to recommend this book. It is not a masterpiece in writing or style, but it provides you with loads of useful information and tips that goes well beyond the Microsoft BTS product documentation. Its examples aren't the easiest to follow, but if you take the time to actually install them on your server, they turn out to be very helpful.You won't find much more good documentation on older BizTalk versions anymore, so definitely get this book if it is still of use to you. It's a heck of a lot cheaper than hiring MCS consultants!"
3,"Biztalk only for ""high-level"", according to Wrox","I would have to agree with purplebari, after chapter 5 things did go down hill. The web page code was definately wrong. I sent an email to the publisher back on 3/16/01 and they confirmed the problem and said they would change it. I had also brought up the fact that they did not explicitly say to compile a DLL and they told me, ""The book assumes the reader will be able to compile their own dll's (if they are high-level enough to work with biztalk)."" In the intro, they say you don't need to know VB to get a lot from the book. If you don't know VB and not ""high-level enough"", you may not want to get this book."
3,Good start,"I learned a lot in the first 5 chapters. When I hit chapter 6, things went downhill fast. All of a sudden they're talking about Advanced Orchestration with an example that is poorly explained. I read the entire example section twice and still didn't understand what was going on - kind of counterproductive for an ""example.""Also, there were some variable and file naming discrepencies between what they told you to type in the book and what was in the examples on the web site. If you skipped typing a long file and just grabbed it off the web site to mix with your typed code you ended up in real trouble. No small part of this problem is Biztalk's idiosyncracies in terms of refreshing files and file names.Get the book - read the first five chapters, watch out for the code from the web site. Then try chapter 6 for yourself - you may have better luck."
4,"Cheap and good, but doesn't quite fit","I got this for like $5, so it must be on closeout or something. It works and sounds great; it even has a USB-powered bass amp to try and give you some deep sounds which are difficult to get in headphones. The only negative is that it seems to be a little big for my (average-sized) head, and doesn't have any way to ""telescope"" so that it would fit better. It's probably made to be ""one size fits all"" or something. I don't really mind, because I always use it while I'm holding very still at my desk, but since it doesn't fit my head well, it doesn't seal over your ears, and whoever's sitting next to you can hear everything. Didn't they try this thing at the lab before going to market? Still...it was only $5, so I'm pretty happy."
2,Not the book you want if you are new to industry,"This book is not written in a clear and concise manner for me. You may be better in getting, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology, 5E"
3,heating and cooling essentials,"I would recomend this book ONLY to an entry level student. The chapters while complete don,t go into the level of detail that they could. If they did this text would serve me better as a reference rather than the fantastic door stop that it makes."
5,Island City,"Even at its beginnings as a little Dutch colony on the rocky southern tip of Manhattan Island, New York has been a busy center of excitement, adventure, and activity of all kinds."
5,A Classic for all the Old School Ravers,"This is the mix that made me love electronic music. Period. From freaky minimalist $h!t to trancy club to breaks to drum and bass all mixed with with a heavy heaping of LSD on top. This cd is mixed by DJ Grumpy (now known as grumptronix) from the Tampa, Florida based Hallucination crew (think Rabbit in the Moon, Dj Monk, QBurns Abstract Message) and maybe it's just me, but just listening to this I can feel the strychnine working on my spine and smell the salty ocean air. This one definitely takes me back in mind to the insane, acid-soaked mid-Florida rave scene of the mid 90s."
5,Great guitar duo by Depapepe,The guitar music of Depapepe is precise and exquisit. They deserve to be known worldwide!
5,"Very detailed and concise, yet comprehendable","I found this guide to be very comprehendable,and it provided all of the necessary detail. If you are tired of reading technical books that get lost in unneccessary jargon, this book is for you. At the same time, the book is heads and tails above others in its class in that it is concise and thorough."
5,A very well written guide for the well adept or novice.,"After reviewing ""Professional Visual Basic 6 Databases"" by Charles Williams, I had concluded that it was the best written book yet in its class. I strongly recommend it."
3,Beginning Visual Basic Database much better,"Well, I read both of these books and must say that Wrox's Beginnig Visual Basic Database book was more clear and more immediately helpful. It almost seemed as if much of this book was taken from the Beginning Book. While both are good, if I had to spend limited resources on a single one, it would be Connell's book. He is more lucid and anticipates my questions while this book seems to reiterate much of Connell's work but in a more opaque style. However, they are both excellent."
5,Transform your confusion into rock solid knowhow!,"This book is one of the best I've read. If you're constantly reading programming magazines, and asking yourself ""What are they talking about?"" or ""Where do I go to learn about this stuff?"", then this is the book. Clearly written, excellent projects, and very relevant material to what's happening NOW in VB. Focus is on ADO, SQL Server, Client/Server 2 and 3 tier models, MTS, and more. Highly recommended!"
4,comprehensive,"This is the only book I could find that covers the data report designer. It could use a few more example reports, but at least it covers it. The book is well-written with clear explanations."
4,Good overall/recap of VB and data access,"If you are looking to get overall information about how to use databases with Visual Basic 6, go for it. If you already have experience on working with VB for n-tier applications and knows ADO pretty well, look elsewhere.This book covers a great deal of material, thus going over some details of them. This book is good for beginners to intermediate people that wants to have quick solutions.For the others, for example, if you are looking for a better implementation of n-tier or to pass data between components; you will have some information in this book but I would suggest the Visual Basic 6 Business Objects and VB6 Distributed Objects, both from Wrox, to get a full coverage on the subject.Overall, this book is good for VB/Data starters."
1,Not Compatible!,"This card is not compatible with the HP Pavillion 6330. Despite the cliams of PC compatibility it did not work for me - my computer never recognized it. I went to the PNY site and found out that other products are correct, you might want to do the same before you buy this."
4,NO MORE LAST MINUTE SEARCHING IN STORES,"THE PERSON WHO FINDS THEMSELF IN STORES AT THE LAST MINUTE BUYING 'PICKED OVER' GREETING CARDS, THIS SOFTWARE IS A PERFECT SOLUTION TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THE COMFORT OF YOUR HOME."
1,Christian CD,"Wish I had my $$$ back: NOT worth the ""HALLMARK"" quality!!!!Please return money if U expect me to $$$ another Hallmark product..CD is worthless...not a good buy at all!!!!"
2,DISAPOINTING SOFTWARE,THIS PROGRAM GIVES YOU A LOT OF GREAT GRAPHICS. I WAS REALLY DISAPOINTED IN THE MESSAGES INCLUDED WITH THE PROGRAM. I HAVE AMERICAN GREETINGS PLATINUM 6 AND IT HAS MORE SPIRITUAL MESSAGES THAN THIS ONE DOES. IT JUST DID NOT GIVE ME WHAT I NEEDED TO DO THE JOB I HAVE TO DO.
3,graphics are just so-so,"The graphics are not sorted as you would think. For instance, if looking for an elephant. You would have to click through pages of 'wild animals' to find an elephant. All graphics are sorted by main catogories. Same with flowers. You sort through several pages of flowers. You can't just click on a specific flower or group (bouguets for instantce.) If you want an envelope to match your card. You have to find an appropriate graphic by searching each graphic catogory. The graphic on the card I guess can be used if you use the crop but that only gives you a few choices. (crop square, round, oval etc. You can only crop out just so much, leaving in something you don't want.)If you don't need to be an 'artist' then this is a faily good graphic program and the price is great.Michel RhoadsAnaheim, Ca."
2,nothing special,"We have four wonderful Wiggles DVDs (we even like the puppets on Yummy Yummy). I borrowed Big Red Car from the library today and it will be going back tomorrow. I once owned Sailing Around the World, but do not have it anymore. Let's just say I did not give it away to anyone else. At least half of the Big Red Car feature is composed of songs and skits by the Captain and his crew, very much like SATW, and those segments are just irritating. This gets 2 stars only because the first few songs actually feature the guys themselves with many songs we don't have already on our other DVDs. I will not rent, borrow, or buy this DVD again."
1,A VERY BAD MOVIE,"This movie is horrible. I just saw it the other day and all I have to say is that everyone on here who gave it a bad review is correct. I wish I listened and didn't buy Here Comes the Big Red Car. My kids didn't like it at all, and I can't say I blame them. This is the Wiggles at their worst. Save your money and time and skip this video."
3,Here comes the big red car,"Great songs, the sound quality wasn't good at all, you turn it up to hear the main singer of that song, then the chorus blew you out of the room...sounded very muffled, but video is great!!"
1,My Kids Hated This Movie,"This movie is terrible. We already have Dance Party, and the new video of the Wiggles lipsynching to their older songs did nothing to keep my kids' attention. They are usually glued to the older Wiggle DVDs but had no interest in this one. The extras are not good either. I give it 2 big thumbs down."
2,inferior,"These songs and skits lack the energy and artistry of the TV show and some of the other DVDs. If you are looking for something different from the TV show, but still want your little one to be entertained try Wiggly Safari or Big Red Boat instead."
2,Disappointed,We used to have all the Wiggles for the kids several years ago so when I ordered this I assumed it would be the same quality. It isn't and I wish I'd read the reviews here first but I didn't think of it. A mistake I'll never make again. The little boy I got it for doesn't seem to mind though so if you haven't seen better I guess it doesn't matter.
2,Recycled songs,"I agree with others that this DVD is just a collection of recycled songs. I, for one, am disappointed that I spent money on it. My 21 month old hasn't complained, because she loves the Wiggles, but it would have been nice to at least spend money on something she hasn't already seen on TV hundreds of times."
2,The Wiggles Haven't Done it Again!!,"The newest video in the Wiggles set ""Here Comes the Big Red Car"" is a disappointment. It is largely a rehash of earlier videos. I agree with the other reviews that the Wiggles have lost the originality, creativity, and enthusiasm of the earlier works. My son (2.5 years old) is addicted to the Wiggles so we continue to buy them, but they are going downhill. I fear they will not remain the kids ""big thing"" if they don't do some work.I hate it that the latest videos don't have the kids in them that they used to have. After all, this is a kid's video. They provided a fun innocence and way for kids to connect with kids that the grownups just can't provide. Furthermore, I am disappointed that the songs in this video are virtually all old ones. This is just not the same Wiggles that we have come to expect and love. Might want to stick with buying the older ones, less polished yes, better content absolutely."
3,The Wiggles Here comes the Big red Car,"I was very disappointed with this DVD, the songs were the same. But, I HATED that fact that they didn't have any children dancing to the songs as they sange. They have the Wiggle dancers (Leeanne, and the rest of the adults). We enjoy the Wiggles, but we enjoy watching the children dance and perform when they sing. I was very disappointed. My favorite Wiggle DVD is the Live Concert one. We watch that one all the time. Check the Wiggles website, they are having more concerts for 2006."
4,It's not that bad!,"Sure, there's too much pirates and not enough Wiggles, but this is still fun. The only thing I could really do without is Admiral Goodbloke. The talking just goes on too long. Other that that, this movie is colorful and catchy."
5,Big Red Car,"This was a good Wiggles video, especially if you are a fan of the older shows that came on Disney Channel last fall(08). I lost a lot of them off my DVR when I switched to cable and this movie had a lot of those clips from the shows that my husband and I missed seeing. My eighteen month old daughter loves the Wiggles, and this movie completely captured her attention. I thought the songs were catchy. There were not very many skits involved, mostly singing, good for toddlers."
1,NEW DVD OLD WIGGLES' SONGS,Do not buy this DVD if you have the early Dance Party DVD. Big Red Car has the same songs as Dance Party but with new scenes. There are one or two new songs. The subject matter has more to do with Captain Feathersword than a Big Red Car. Big disappointment!
3,Didn't really say anything important.,I do not recommend this for anyone grieving the tragic loss of a loved one. It has been difficult to find comforting words for the loss of a young child.
5,helps alot,i bought this for my coworker who lost her son 4 years ago and is still having difficulty having some closure this book has helped her greatly
3,Required reading in understanding solder joint fatigue,"In depth treatment of solder joint reliability. Excellent text for those attempting to understand the solder joint metalurgy and life calculation.Detail can be mind-numbing, but all the material includes high level information as well as all the gritty details.A must for the reference shelf, as I find myself refering to it often."
4,john deere welcome to merriweather farm,My 4 year old son loves john deere tractors. He wanted a J.D. computer game. He has really enjoyed playing these games.
4,grandson loves it,My grandson loves this game as it lets him drive the tractor. The game was in excellent condition when arriving.
5,If only people understood,"I only wish that the medical community was more accepting of Peggy Claude-Pierre and her method of treatment. Victims of eating disorders who have been in and out of traditional hospital programs for years on end have finally found relief and help at the Montreux Clinic. If it saves just one child, isn't that proof that it works? I think it is a shame that people are so skeptical of her methods. All it takes is an open mind to see that force-feeding and punishment of non-eating is NOT the way to help a mentally an physically sick child get better. I think this is an excellent book and would recommend it to anyone, particularly parents struggling with an eating-disordered child. There is hope out there."
2,I thought this book kind of sucked,I mean if you know nothing about eating disorders you might gleen some information. But on the overall I found nothing helpful for recovery.
5,"Finally Now I Understand the ""Voice""","I recently read this book and was truly amazed that this woman really did understand the ""secret language"" that runs around in my head. Now I know that ""it"" also runs around in the heads of many others. This book proved to me that there is hope for people suffering from eating disorders and believe me ""we"" do suffer. I first started struggling with my weight as a pre-teen over 40 years ago and until I read this book I thought I was doomed until the day I died that I would never conquer that ""voice"" in my head. Now I know that I will recover and I thank Peggy Claude-Pierre for ""hanging in there"" when others didn't. I am saddened that many ""professionals"" do not understand this lady's approach to such an awful condition. Her method ""works"", lives are being saved and isn't that what counts in the end."
5,If You're Struggling and Need Help...,"Are you seeking an answer?Though this Book isn't a ""cure all"", it does answer some questions you may have. Questions such as:""Why do I/my daughter/my son/my wife hate herself?""""What can I do to help myself (or him/her)?""""What have others done that may apply to me (or him/her)?""""What methods/actions should I take to help my/their future?""etc etc...This book is pretty big (not huge) but it's pact full of useful information. Peggy even shares information of the many rehabilitation center's she has set up in and around the country and shares success stories of her own patients (without disclosing their names).Having gone through this struggle myself in High School (when I bought the book), and even re-reading this book to date - it still sits on my shelf where it will remain because it IS useful. It does give life-changing information that WILL help you.If you have a question about eating disorders, it has the answer. :)"
4,Enjoyable Teen Lit,"Megan Meade is a really fun heroine who doesn't take herself too seriously when she finds herself in a rather awkward situation of living with 7 more boys that she is used. (Instead of going to Korea with her military parents.) She really figures out not only who each of the boys are but also finds her own voice in the process. I've tried to read some of Brian's other books, but none of them grabbed me the way this one did. A fun read for teen readers that doesn't get as crazy about certain R rated topics that alot of books in this genre do."
2,this book,it was a really okay book and I didn't really like it so I am not giving it a great review
5,Fun!,"Its been said in previous reviews, but this book really is just good fun. Sure there are alot of cliches, but Megan Meade's explores many a teen girls fantasty with this novel and manages to do so somewhat realistically. This wasn't a paticulary moving novel, but it left me feeling lighthearted after reading.Reccomended for light reading."
3,what!,What a crappy ending to an otherwise good book. Do not expect to be satisfied with any kind of ending or book two here.
3,fun teen story,I like the main character very much. The boys seem rather immature. There were exciting highlights and suspense as you wonder which boy she'll end up with.The flaws are that the ending is very rushed; the girl friends are not in sight; and the inconclusiveness is not satisfying.
5,Fun Book,"I really enjoyed this book. The story centers around an Army brat who decides she doesn't want to follow her parents to Korea. So . . . she stays with her parents's friends, parents to a brood of good looking boys. Megan has to learn to fit in at her new digs (with much resistance), and at school, where she falls prey to bad rumors. Very cute story. I really liked it. Light reading with a few good lessons thrown in. I would definitely recommend it."
2,$$$$$$$$$,Unfortunately this book had an unsatisfying ending. I read through the reviews and although people mentioned twists in the story I didn't get an impression of how unsatisfying the ending was. It was incredibly anticlimactic. I literally could have purchased 10 other books for the price of this and had more of a chance for an emotionally satisfying read.
3,Money,Love the book just wished it was cheaper took me forever to get my mom to buy it other than that great book
4,Really Good Just Rushed A Little.,"This is like a fantasy fo tweens and teens everywhere. Her parents are away, she moves in with SEVEN CUTE boys, and she's the co-captain of the soccer team! Over all it was really good. But, the end was kind of rushed and you never really found out if Flinn and Megan are boyfriend and girlfriend. I would recomend this book but it's a tiny bit confusing."
2,"Generic, unoriginal and uninspired screamo-pop...","Yeah, okay, so maybe a couple of the songs are descent, but as a whole, this album is pretty BAD...I mean, i'm not saying that LK isn't talented, but does the world really need another ""screamo band with pop-sensibility and metal breakdowns""???? It was cool when story of the year did it, even better when finch perfected it, and awesome when the used brought it to the mainstream, but now, its just plain getting old. I'm not surprised this band hasn't gotten big yet, mainly cuz' the music world was already over-saturated with this stuff long before LK hit the scene...To make a long story short, I'll be putting my copy up for sale at $3.00 even pretty soon..."
5,Are u ready for real talent?,"O man that is all i have to say, i am completly blown away, i first heard of these guys 3 months ago as i was scrolling through the band list for the 2004 vans warped tour and loved the three songs i heard, then i saw them live and i was blown away. If u like Story of the Year, Finch or Thrice this cd is a must have, every track is good in it's own way especially the two slow songs hold my heart part 1 and part 2 they r so good!!!"
4,PLEASING.RELAXING and SOOTHING,"A disc that also can be listened to at dinner time,Relaxing, or Social Dancing. The orchestra, as a lot of European Orchestras and Bands, a-la Mantavonni,Black,Ros,and Last, have it all together. Most of selections are tops. Well worth a listen. No regrets. Also, very cool arraingments and Piano playing."
5,Delicious recipies,"This is a wonderful book filled with delicious recipes. They use common ingredients & most are fairly easy to make. Recipes include French toast, pancakes, cereals, fruits, beverages, desserts, muffins, & baked goods.Egg, meat & cheese dishes including soufflés, quiches, & casseroles are here as well. Each recipe has a description of the B&B it is from along with contact information An index also lists the inns by city.Some of my favorite recipes include the peach coffee cake, morning pizza, & broccoli bake. I also enjoyed the carrot cookies. My overnight guest loved the surprise French toast made with cream cheese & pecans.I really love the section in the back filled with household hints. I found these very useful as they really do help save time & money. They have also helped make guests at my at home feel more welcome."
2,Way too long.,"The Transformation centers around three young girls in Hollywood. In the midst of the stories of each girl, a cult is at the center. I found the story to be way too long with an uninteresting plot. Not one of Fielding's better novels."
2,Not pleasant to read,"I had a hard time staying interested when reading this book. The chapters are too long and dense. This book would be best used as a reference, not for enjoyment and learning."
5,Brazilian Sketches - Jim Tomlinson,"It would be difficult to rave too much about this collection by Jim Tomlinson. Clearly he is a tenor player in the Getz/Young mold, BUT, his sound and flowing lines are unique unto themselves. I have rarely enjoyed an album as much as this one put together by contemporary players. It is easily one of the finest Bossa Nova releases since the sixties era when BN was at it's height. Tomlinson has a searing, flowing beauty to his lines that add incredible warmth to these mostly Jobim tunes. That his wife, the incredible Stacey Kent takes part in 4 of the tracks is just another reason for what must be rated as a ***** album. Don't miss it!"
1,Can't play a complete DVD,"Things started out fine but within a year it got bad fast - it can't play an entire DVD without sputtering, skipping, or crawling to a complete halt. Going to throw it in the trash."
1,Not happy,"I did not buy this product through Amazon but wanted to share my experience for your consideration. I only had this player for a few months before it started making an annoying noise while playing. I have had no troubles in any other respect and was pleased with it (except the power button is in the worst location and I have inadvertently bumped it off numerous times), but the noise is loud enough and substantially annoying so that I will have to buy a replacement. The noise is best described as ""wobbly, vibrating"", like the spinning device is uneven. When a dvd is not playing/spinning, the noise stops."
1,From Bad to Worse,"I bought this machine about 9 months ago and one of the first DVDs I watched on it skipped regularly so that I couldn't get through it. I blamed it on the quality of the DVD and managed to watch a few others successfully. Then after a few weeks I began having more troubles with different DVDs. It has gotten to the point where I consider myself lucky if I make it half way through a movie with out it skipping or stalling. Most times I can't even get the DVD to load. Then I turn on my laptop and watch the movie from there straight through with out any problems. I don't expect at low price DVD to have all the bells and whistles, but I do expect it to at least play a DVD."
1,It died on me.,"The player worked fine when new, but has been in a steady state of decline ever since. I assumed this was due to scratched DVDs, but now it won't play brand new ones. Phillips lost a customer. My next DVD player will not be a Phillips brand."
2,Cheap DVD player..for a reason.,"I bought this DVD player over a year ago and it stopped working weeks after i got it. Every time i put in a brand new DVD, it would play for a little while and then pause and spin the disc for several minutes, sometimes the movie would start back up and other times..no such luck. Now after months of being deployed, i came back home hoping the player would work. Now it doesn't even recognize DVDs are in the slot. So i just ended up buying a new DVD player to replace this piece of ...."
5,Awesome!,"Easily the best DVD player I have ever purchased. Simply for the fact that it plays EVERYTHING I throw at it. Region code 0 makes it easy for me to play DVDs from all over the world. You got some downloaded movies on a disk? No problem, this Philips knows em all. It is also a bit smaller than other DVD players, which makes it look great for the money.Love it! Oh, and I am not just saying this."
2,Not to pleased,"I love Hammer Horror Movies and I bought The Ultimate Hammer Collection from Amazon.co.uk, And they are region 2 DVDs so I bought this Philips Multi-region DVD player but unfortunatley it was defective and It only played one of my region 2 DVDs that wasn't part of the ultimate hammer collection. I really don't know why it will only play one of them? it's a huge mystery to me. Does anyone know any region unlocking codes I can use to fix the problem? If you do please teach me."
1,Philops DVP3040 Multi Region Code Free Divx DVD Player,Did not reveived the item ordered and even though the package was not opened becuase the description did not match what amazon had I have not received a full refund as was promised by Amazon and the supplier.
1,"Maybe ours is a dud, but...","We have not had luck getting more than 1 episode of any disc to play on this crap-bucket. We own a $30 ""Mintek"" DVD player (who has heard of that?) which has performed faithfully for 5 years but is about to die, and unfortunately with this particular Phillips model, we are stuck with the poor dying Mintek until we figure out something else. Discs skip after one episode, but play fine on the other player. SAVE YOUR RECEIPT!"
2,not so scary,"I'm a big fan of 70th horror movies but this one is not so interesting.There is not one drop of blood, all victims die drowend, and the zombies aren't very scary.On the good side we have Brooke Adams in bikini, Peter Cushing speaking german and John Carradine (only some time - he dies first)."
4,What Can I Say -- I Really Liked It.,"I can't argue with some of the critical reviews, from slow pacing to misuse of Peter Cushing, to laughably ineffective Nazi scuba zombies.That said, what can I say -- I really enjoyed this movie.First off, you have a great premise, great location (the film was shot in Miami and features many scenes in the then-shuttered historic Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables), and the beautiful Brooke Adams in a bikini.Add Peter Cushing, a wry John Carradine, creepy soundtrack and atmospheric directing, and you have a pulpy, fun B-movie zombie fest.I fully understand why this film was a midnight movie staple at the Grove cinema back in the day.I also enjoyed the extras, including interviews and old Miami Herald press clippings from when they filmed this in South Florida back in 1975."
2,"Intriguing idea, but fairly boring","Neat idea, pretty boring rendition, though I've seen worse. If you are a Peter Cushing or John Carradine completist, or you want to see Brooke Adams looking pretty excellent in a bikini, you may want to see it for their appearances (Cushing and Carradine are more like extended cameos). There are a couple of semi-creepy moments, but it's not much of a horror film. I guess I can see the cult appeal, but it's not on my list of films to re-watch."
4,Schlock Waves,"I saw this gem a couple decades ago on late, late nite TV and the site of the goggled Nazi corpses slowly emerging from the Florida surf was a creep-out that has stayed with me to this day. Obviously on a very low budget, the producers and director did a rather inventive job with what they had. You have to figure that Peter Cushing and John Carradine were probably looking for a Florida vacation, since their parts are mostly cameos. It still holds up quite well today, a rare example of the ""daytime creep-out"", rather a difficult thing to do, particularly in a tropical location usually reserved for Beach Blanket Bingo and the like. The sets are terrific, probably because they were using actual interiors from an abandoned hotel in Palm Beach much of the time.A very fun movie, if for nothing else, the wonderful Peter Cushing's effortless work as a German commander, exiled in paradise.""Zen...you are all STUPID!!!""Priceless."
3,A Little Cheesy & Chillin',"I had looked for this for YRS> because it was so scary the 1st time I saw it & was early 80s....finally found it 25 yrs. later at AMAZON! Now that I watch it with my older sons it's cheesy & funny. Make-up is green, BUT they've been underwater w LOVED IT! If you like this one you have GOT to see ""Dead Snow"" (on this one-make sure u can use subtitle to get Eng.or captions, otherwise it's in German. ShockWaves is Eng. Remember the scary part in this one: Hitler and those damned Nazis were some BADASS MFs....did AH & his scientits succeed?....... WERE they ""invincible""??????"
5,Best Chems single ever!,"This is simply the Chemical Brothers' finest single of all time among their many landmark releases. It is the only place you will find track 2, 'Prescription Beats', a monster of a track that will leave your body and nerves a mashed mess on the dance floor, maybe their hardest track to date, but still funked up like only the masters can do. Also on track 3 is the awesome funk fest that is 'Morning Lemon', featured on their mix brothers gonna work it out. 'Morning Lemon' is in my opinion their best b-side ever, easily being featured on an album if they chose to. Track 4 is a fun and memorable mix of block rockin by the Micronauts."
1,Why do they let this man publish?,"Insipid tripe. Not bad as kindling, but the stink of the prose can permeate your food, so you may want to consider manure instead."
4,error in the posting,"This is definately a show to watch, but there is an error in the way it is listed. In the language line of the disc information it is posted as only language being Japanese. This is not true. It is a choice of both Japanese and English with the English sub titles."
4,different cord,I wish it had a coil type cord instead of the straight one it came with other wise it is good
2,All that glitters is not Rob Vieira,"I had mistakenly thought that Wrox books were held to a higher standard. First getting a taste for them going through both of Rob Vieira's two SQL Server Programming books and regarding them as the finest technical books I've ever seen. However this Professional SQL Server 2000 XML is a disappointment. Part of the problem lies with having 12 different authors because it seems a bit jumpy. I think I'll really try to limit my future purchases to single source efforts. Also, no care was taken with the code examples that you can download from the Wrox website. The book shows the source but there is really no way of really matching the example to the source other than guessing the name. Often I've needed to open up all 15 or so files in the directory to realize that the particular example is not included. I'm picking my way through but it is not pleasant."
3,Great game play...very short game...too easy to beat...,This game is a great game for everyone to play...angler or not...everyone seems to love the control...best yet...the graphics...great...and the commentary. The only draw back to the game is its lack of depth...very few places to fish...and really easy to finish the game...in about two hours. This is not a game for the serious fishing enthusiast...if you are looking for fun...for a bunch of people...this is a really great game!
3,its alright,"this game is pretty good. the only thing i dont like is the modes that u fish in. the tournaments ... because u dont really get a chance to fish because its based on a timer and once its up u weight your 3 biggest fish. another bad thing is that u dont get to go where u want in a boat, u just pick a fishing scene and cast. another small con is when your reeling a fish in, it constantly goes back and forth to the underwater view at which u cant reel in and u just have to watch, that really gets old after a while. so does the game. youll like it wen u get it but it gets old and boring."
5,Tickets to success,"They are Christians, obviously. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? Fantastic book, all their books are fantastic. They teach parenting in a chrisitan manner. EXACTLY WHAT WE ALL NEED."
2,Daughter Josephine Tumminia,"My interest in ""Murder on the High Cs"" is for track #12 which is my mother's, Josephine Tumminia, recording of the Blue Danube with Jimmy Dorseyand His Orchestra. This originally was recorded on Decca Records in the 30's. Tracks #10 through #17 are nostalgic and fun. Tracks #1 through #9 by Florence Jenkins truly is ""Murder on the High Cs"".Charlene A. Swenson"
3,...uh...,"I actually don't feel it helps me alot...i was just looking for a pocket size book so I bought it. It has lots of good stuff, but just what I've already know...some general senses...some points help you writing...anyway. a good little book, just not the type I want..."
4,GOOD BIOGRAPHY,"This book is a good biography of the Dodge City years and Tombstone affairs of both Wyatt and his brothers. I used to read many 'Landmark' editions in junior and senior high school so I assume this book to be primarily for young adults. No matter as it reads well. Can be read in one evening and yet those cow town and silver mining town years are well fleshed out.If you admire what Wyatt did against the cowboy lawless element in Tombstone you will enjoy this book. If as has become somewhat recently fashionable to disregard what Wyatt Earp was and stood for then maybe you will not. For me as always, Wyatt was a man to ride the river with. Doc Holliday got it right when he made his stand with Wyatt and his brothers.See you soon, amigos."
1,The worst book in the world!,"Straight out of Microsoft's manuals, this book was obviously just a ploy for the authors to say ""Look at me, I am published."" Wrox let us down with this one. Horrible index's proved to be as fun as a proctology exam."
2,Not Enough,"This book was a disappointment. Mostly it shows how to create packages using the Enterprise Mgr interface. I don't need a book to do that. Right now I am coding a VB app using DTS, and this book was definitely not enough. This is a beginner book, introductory in nature. There is an Object reference, but I can see that in the Object Browser. The examples are simplistic and not real-world. The examples on the SQL Server 2000 Resource Kit are better. I am moving large amounts of data data and have to deal with permissions, constraints, dependency tables -- none of this is covered. You can manipulate the object model thousands of ways; without any guidance on these advanced topics (not covered by MSDN) you are adrift... and your packages will fail every time.If you are a programmer, don't bother with this one."
4,Good; not quite reference-quality,"There are very few resources for DTS, so I bought this one to help me understand the programming models involved. I'm not thrilled with it, but it does explain the models very quickly and succinctly."
2,Just not enough meat...,"Every time you think it's about to get good with this book, they cut you off and go on to some other topic. I found sqldts.com far more complete and helpful than this book. Good luck finding anything in the index."
2,Mediocre book,This book merely skims the surface of DTS. Enough details of DTS are not supplied. For instance there are a number of annoyances with DTS that must be avoided using workaround that are mentioned nowhere in this book. Also more complicated subjects of DTS are merely skimmed through. This book is not good for beginner nor for professionals.
2,No rush to judgment,"I am new to DTS and VB. This book was a big help in the early chapters. It got me using the basic DTS features. Now I'm up to page 308 and have just spent 1-1/2 hours keying in a VB example. It doesn't work. I went over the code; I've keyed it in as it is shown and it still doesn't work. I do not have the expertise to troubleshoot it. I'm beginning to have my doubts about the next 800 pages. Sorry, guys. Before you publish you should try this stuff out on real world users."
2,Not what I'd expect from Wrox,"Unfortunately this book fell well below my expectations. The index is incomplete, making it hard to find information. The examples as given probably won't work: no mention is given to fairly major problems like dealing with ActiveX scripts running in different threads.Very little useful guidance is given, especially to help get round DTS's flaws.And when I went for code it wasn't at the website. Wrox did sent me the code pretty quick when emailed for it."
2,Pass on this one,"I got this book to help me get a head start on the Analysis Services MCDBA exam. I found it to be disorganized and full of filler. This book clearly could have been, no, should have been half its length but was fluffed to justify the standard $50 min that is charged for all the books in the Wrox Professional series. There is some useful stuff in this book but its not very well done."
2,Save your money,"I don't understand where these other reviews are coming from. Surely anyone who has read this book knows that the writing is so poor that it takes hours to glean one tidbit of new knowledge. Even then, there aren't any usable code examples to solidify what you think you may have learned.Buy ATL Internals instead, it's a much better book, and doesn't cost $60!"
1,"Dry, boring style","I think sometimes that authors of these books write them because they think that people don't like to read MSDN Library and prefer paper editions. This is partially true. However there is a group of people looking fror something more readable and illustrated that Microsoft's texts. This book has been addressed to professionals who probably have good access to current MSDN Library. Unfortunately, after comparison of some parts of book with original documentation I must say that the companion's documentation is better to read and complete (by definition). Examples presented in this book are sometimes the same as in library and no more. The style of explanation of some details is even worse than reading dry technical specifications. It is the waiste of money."
4,An ATL must have,"Excellent book, especially the discussion on threading, marshaling, and connection points. This book gets into the guts of ATL so don't plan on reading it in one weekend. It will take a good developer about a week to digest each chapter thoroughly. You will probably end up rereading the book after you gain some experience. Learning COM technologies requires a lot of time and patience and ATL is no exception."
4,"Boring, but informative","I highly recommand this book to those who want to really learn ATL. It delves into implementation detail of ATL abit too much though. It is abit less practical than ATL Internals, but is packed with lots of examples to help beginners grasp the atl/com concept.All in all, this book is definitely worth the money & time to read, but one heck of a boring book to read."
3,A very tough book.,"This is a great book but it is a very painful read. I cannot explain why it is but I certainly learned a lot from it but it took a very long time to read it. Examples are fantastic. Other than the fact that it is hard to read, it certainly is another quality product from Wrox. If you are a little confused with this review, you will be even more confused after read this book. Not bed time reading."
5,Most excellent,"It is a very useful book if you already have some experience with ATL and COM but have some questions about those technologies unanswered. The author gives an excellent explanation of almost any aspect of ATL yet assumes the reader is not a complete newbie. The chapters on Object Wizard and on Threading and Marshalling are particularly useful. In combination with PROFESSIONAL COM APPLICATIONS WITH ATL, this book provides a powerful resource for an ATL COM developer!"
5,Most Excellent,"After playing with ATL for about a week I realized I needed help and Microsoft Press books were not going to be my answer. Merely pages into Chapter 1 and Dr. Grimes had begun teaching me what I needed to know to write real world applications. He doesn't ramble or break your concentration by trying to be funny... every topic is presented in a concise and pratical manner. This is the best advanced book I have ever read and is appropriate for a C++ programmer already familiar with MSVC and the basic concepts behind COM. I find it strange that there is a 'Beginning ATL COM' book though, because my only exposure to ATL before this was a single chapter in the MSVC Programmer's guide and I did not have to play catch-up to follow along."
4,Detailed,"It's a decent book. Definitely worth the money and much better than ""Beginning ATL COM"" in that this book is not all about how to use ATL Object Wizard. But just so you know, it is one boring book to read. It takes time n patience to understand how ATL works."
2,Broken cap,One of the two caps was broken on one of the bottles along it unable to reseal once I open it.
4,Hot Sauce -- Amazon,"The sauce added a great deal of flavor to the dishes we prepared. We thought we had discovered something brand new here in South Jersey, and told our friends about it; but one of them, who is a cooking gourmet, said she had been using the Rooster for years and found it at Shop Rite. Shocking! We're happy we found the product and now have the cookbook, so we're on to better living!"
5,Outstanding college text,"This text is indeed used for college history classes and is usually assigned in US survey classes that cover the colonial period to the present day. The amount and depth of material in the text is quite exceptional. The book includes chapter review pages, suggested readings and documents and tables. It also includes a generous amount of primary source documents, drawings and photographs, color maps and graphs. It is beautifully written and illustrated. It is expensive, but this is the case for all large survey texts and college lab books.It is troubling to me that an individual would ""review"" a book they have never read and would disparage college professors for assigning the appropriate text for a class. Clearly, this individual does not understand the distinction between college texts and popular history books."
5,Better than described!,"Item was much better than described! A little slow to ship, but was well worth the wait. Thanks so much!"
2,Written in 1939!,"I picked this up used, it has a late 70's cover, so I assumed it was it was written then it was actually written in 1939! I might have approachedit a little differently if I had know that. It is a little dated and throws a lot of Roman History at you. I have no idea how accurate it is.I do enjoy books of this type like ""Island in the Sea of Time"" and ""TheRadiant Knight"" Series, this one just does did not work for me."
5,Great Classic SF,"I love this book. In Mussolii's Italy, professor is zapped back to very late Roman Empire, when the Goths basically rule. He has some adventures a la ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" but he does not always know how to bring in modern inventions, unlike Twain's Yankee. Can you make gunpowder out of raw materials? What would it really be like to be a modern man in those days? Lots of fun."
1,this book sucks,i guess i was expecting a more conventional erotic book so this book really disappointed me. there was really only one story that i found arousing. i threw this book out
3,Mixed Feelings,"I received this software as a gift and was very excited as I experimented with it and tried the various features. The ability to search by ingredient is great for when you have an ingredient on hand that you want to use up (especially if you have a vegetable garden). However, if you're buying it for the recipe-scaling feature, be careful. It doesn't work how you think it might. I'm ending up scaling the recipes by hand to avoid messing up the search engine."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed to learn that this product does not work on Windows XP. As I looked into the matter, I discovered that Sierra is discontinuing the MasterCook line. I have been using it since version 3. It seems like they were so interested in making the interface 'pretty' that they forgot to make it usable. Navigating is a real hassle. It's not surprising that they decided to discontinue the line. It's still very disappointing though.I started using Cook'n and so far, I am extremely pleased. I received an e-mail message from the President himself shortly after registering. I was somewhat skeptical about it but I replied and discovered that the software was developed by a guy who loves what he does. He's been doing it for nine years. I feel much more confident putting my recipes in Cook'n...knowing that at least the product will be supported for years to come."
2,more used than thought,it is in black and white and its suppos t be in color had alot more high lights then expected and some words are had to ead since it looks like it wasjust printed from a machine with no ink.
4,It is useful using the site in good business,I am very pleased with the service & i hope for more progress in the future.Ahmed Alaa
4,Good Speakers for the Price!,"I went looking for speakers when my brother got a set with a subwoofer that went along with them. I looked all through and since I didn't have much money at the time I set my sights on this set. I recieved them and once i got it set up I was suprised by them! They do a great job for the money I paid, though I know there are better one's out there this is a good choice.The only downfall was the subwoofer had to be put off to the side and the cords barely made the distance, and it also has a lack of headphone jacks, so i can listen to the music without disturbing others."
4,boomin,"I have my computer in my basement and had to turn down the volume because when the screensaver is on, I can hear the ocean rush from my living room."
5,simply amazing,"I have been in the martial arts for many years and have tried meditation of all sorts. Nothing has helped me more than this cd. It is so easy. I listen to it at night and I sleep extremely well , waking refreshed and ready to face the day. When I am having a particularly stressful day I go to my car and listen to it on break. Not only will it help you sleep but it will help you deal with your day to day stress. Another side effect is that it also helps me cope with the fact that I am also diabetic and dealing with a whole host of issues day to day. Bottom line is everyone should own this cd."
5,A transformative journey,"Relax Release and Dream On provides you with a guide, in Gale Glassner Twersky, who leads you into a place of calm reflection. This recorded guided meditation has helped me relax during waking hours as well as relax prior to sleeping. I find that the more I listen, the better I respond to Gale's voice and prompts to take the body and mind deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. Just the sound of Gale's soothing voice and encouraging tones promote a feeling of calm in me. I think that this guided meditation will be useful to people working to overcome anxiety, stress, restlessness and overactive mind, whether working to accomplish major life changes or simply to assist in sleeping more easily and restfully. I particularly enjoy the visualization exercises. Relax, Release and Dream On is a necessary life tool!"
2,Not as good as Canon,I usually buy Canon replacement cartridges but I wanted to try a compatible brand because of the price. After placing the cartridges in the printer I had to run the clean heads twice. I've had the printer for over 2 years and I only had to do this once before. The color is not as bold so I'm going to stick with Canon the next time I need ink.
4,Born,"BornThis is a hot movie. The movie is well acted, has a great storyline, and has some pretty hot scenes."
5,Incredible technicians,"The music is so fresh and beautiful, the solos are incredible and impossible..this is a must for every guitar and jazz fan"
2,Not the best of Gambale. Don't buy it.,"This DVD is BORING except for the solos where Frank shows all your impressive technique. I didn't like the music. It's so melodyLESS, inspirationLESS, passionLESS. I'm a huge fan of Gambale, but this is not his best.The audio isn't good. The guitar's volume is a little bit higher than necessary and irritant in some parts, overlaping details of others instruments. You can't hear all the dynamics from the snare drum, even in a hi-fi HT system like mine (onkyo+jbl).The tab booklet don't include a single solo. Only the boring and ultra easy harmonies. Maybe you'll learn a little about harmony, and this is all. I'm very disappointed with this DVD.(Sorry for my english)"
3,"Smells good, but don't like the ingredients","Used to get this for my girlfriend for bubble baths. She loves the smell; it's very pungent. You can smell this in the next room, but it's not a bad smell, it's fairly soothing. Bought it because it seemed all-natural and free of artificial colors (as it advertises on the label) however, i noticed that unfortunately it contains at least one paraben, and SLS. We try to buy peronal care products that are free of those ingredients, among many others so we won't be getting this one anymore. Other than that, this is a great product to use for bubble baths, it produces lots of foam & bubbles. There are other organic bubble baths to be found on amazon, just have to look for them."
1,A waste of time ...,I bought this book at the airport returning from a long visit to the Netherlands and found the writing poor and mean-spirited. Look elsewhere if you want a current view of life in the Netherlands.
1,Offensive and mean spirited,"I have travelled throughout Holland, and have long loved the unique quality of the people. While this book makes some true statements, and is occassionally funny, it is predominantely derogatory and blindered.Many of the negative observations of the Dutch (and almost all of the observations are negative) are not even dutch specific. Living in the United States, I have seen many of the same flaws made manifest.Don't waste your money and risk having yourself tainted prior to a visit to Holland."
2,Didn't Like It That Much,"Maybe it's a generational thing but I was disappointed in the overly smark alecky approach of this book. It's also a little dated. That said, it IS tremendously informative if you can tolerate the excessive cutseyness and I did learn alot. However, I will be taking it along to my local book buyer because I don't want it and won't recommend it. I've just returned from my first visit so I've still got some very sweet feelings about the green heart of Holland and its wondrous history, courage, and 20 million tulips. Was in Amsterdam too, even for Queen's Day which was uproarious all around. This approach doesn't seem that humorous too me and I think if I were to live there, it might hurt my feelings. As I say, could be a generational thing."
4,Informative though a little offensive as well...,"I just completed this mostly pleasant little book written by an American about the Netherlands. I will state that the book contains a significant amount of information and background on all aspects of Dutch society. I do like how the author did not shy away at all from introducing Dutch words throughout the book but I do have an issue with the negative views, at times very judgemental regarding the size of housing and the daily goings on throughout the country. I also found there to be a considerable amount of derogatory comments interspersed in almost every chapter against the Dutch as a whole.Ultimately I find that even with the negative comments and obviously American tainted expectations and views, that the overall book is well written and worth every penny of the asking price."
2,"Indeed, there's better stuff out there","As a dutch expat, this book was given to me by friends as a joke. I read it, and was severely disappointed. As has been stated before, the authors try so hard to be funny and give an accurate description of the Dutch, that they fail on both accounts. I did laugh on occasion, but all in all I found this book pretty pathetic. I don't mind at all looking at my own country with critical eyes, as long as the information is correct. Unfortunately, in this book, it isn't.The Low Sky (Han van der Horst) is much better at describing the Dutch. So, if you're really interested in Dutch culture, by that book.If you are looking for a book to tell you something about where to go and what to see while in Amsterdam, buy the Lonely Planet.For those among you who read Dutch books: Retourtjes Nederland by Simon Kuper. This is an interesting book about the changes that have taken place in the Netherlands over the last few years."
1,Rubbish,"Couldn't get through it, found it tedious and insulting to my intelligence. A great book about Amsterdam is My 'Dam Life by Sean Condon, but this one will only put you off the author, if nothing else."
1,What a waste of time,"As the title states; The Un-Dutchables (very UN)A book written by foreigners, about foreigners. In a country that has so much and so many different cultures you can not expect things to be like they are in the U.S. But learning and being around people in The Netherlands will give you a different view then this book writes about. I hope all that do read the book will keep their minds open and know that the book is mosty fiction."
5,Very Helpful - and Very Funny,"The UnDutchables provides some good information about the Netherlands and its inhabitants, but does so with a smile and a nudge in the ribs. I read parts of this book over the phone to my Dutch boyfriend and we both laughed so hard we couldn't breathe! He said that much of the information was ""typical Dutch"" and he didn't realize how funny these things appeared to foreigners."
5,Tongue in cheek,"This book was a recommended to us by a citizen of the Netherlands as a means of gaining a better understanding of her country. At first, I was confused by the writer's style until I realized it was a very tongue-in-cheek description of the country. I found it most helpful in separating facts from legends of the country and its people. If read in conjunction with a more serious book ""Culture Shock"" by Hunt Janin & Ria van Eil, it should prepare you as much as you can to visit the a culture not your own."
1,"Not as good or funny as ""My 'Dam Life""","Although highly recommended I thought the novel's tone was nasty. It is quite simply another example of the British (authors are Brits) making themselves sound superior to everyone else. While the material may be accurate, the attitude does not lend itself to humor--unless you enjoy humor at the expense of another culture.A much better and infinitely funnier book is, ""My 'Dam Life"" by Sean Condon. This memoir by an Australian expat living in Amsterdam covers much of the same material and enlightens about Dutch culture but is well edited. It is rife with imagery that will not soon be forgotten; imagery woven into hilarious narratives on topics such as Queen's Day, housing difficulties, bicycles, and not surprisingly Holland's flat landscape. How flat is it? It is so flat...""that when you look toward Belgium you can see a man on a step ladder waving..."" Now that's funny."
4,Humorous and insightful,i was given this book as a gift from my Dutch friend who has lived his whole life in the Netherlands. He finds it funny and thought it was the best way for me to understand some of the weird things about him. His behavior in the US makes a lot more sense. I think this book needs to be taken with a grain of salt and realize it is sarcasm and humor to purvey the culture of the Dutch. I would read it again for sure!
5,A real hoot!,This is one of the funniest books I've ever read! A bunch of us read parts out loud and laughed til we cried. I was in Holland some years ago and returned for a few weeks this year. The book explained a lot about the people and their quirks. It takes a sense of humor to fully appreciate this book. I can see how it might offend some stuffy people but most Dutch aren't that way. I find them to be fun like the book. I recommend it to just about anyone!
4,You Don't Know The Dutch?,"This is the only good book I've read about Dutch life. No other book has been able to give an insider's view of the Dutch as well as ""The UnDutchables"". The authors have both lived in the Netherlands for a considerable amount of time, so they know what they're talking about when it comes to the Dutch. The book covers topics such as: Money, A Dutch Home, Children, the Dutch work ethic, Politics, The Dutch Language and Sex 'N Drugs And Rock ""n Roll. It gives us a picture of the Dutch as they are; it tells about their odd and peculiar habits as well as their admirable ones. Many of the Dutch people who have read the book found themselves laughing and agreeing with the authors' perceptions. I think the book is great. You will definitely have a great time getting to know those crazy Netherlanders; and you don't have to be in a hash bar to enjoy this book"
4,Nice book,"I like that it gives a lot of interesting information and the fact that it's done with humor, but sometimes (not very often though) they try too hard to make it funny, they go over the edge with the sarcasm and they end up making things quite difficult to understand."
3,Secret Space: What Is Nasa Hiding?,"The second disc was exactly the same as the first one, other than that very interesting stuff"
3,Good but.........,"The main video is pretty good. I like the narrators style, he presents things with a sense of humor. The footage is quite good and compelling for the most part. The negative is that the 2nd disc is almost exactly the same as 2nd. Why bother putting 2 DVDs and calling it a set when it's duplicate material. Aside from that it's worth watching. The scene of UFOs going into a thunderstorm where you can clearly see them entering the cloud layer (so it can't be ice) is worth the price alone!"
3,Not his best.,I felt that the main character Cat was unbelievable. He goes from company man to James bond in 007 seconds. The first part was riveting. End was predictable.
4,White Cargo,A book that is hard to put down--great for beach reading. Kept my attention throughout the entire book. Only downfall--weak ending.
1,Not even close to believable!,"This was my first Stuart Woods read and have to say, was not impressed and it will probably be my last.First of all, if the author would have paid more attention to letting us get to know the characters instead of going on and on and on.....telling us about ALL the parts that go into makng an airplane fly.....wow! just don't think we had to have all this information.....did this author just learn to fly and attempting to impress us with his flying skills instead of working on making the story more believable.....nothing in this book was belivable....no emotion in ANY of the characters.... had to skip pages and pages to get to the end so I could see how this sad story/writing ends.....5 STAR RATINGS?????Seriously?????pleasesave your $$ and your time on this one.....wish I had!"
5,White Cargo,Great book! I had a hard time putting it down. One of Stuart woods best normally I read the stone Barrington novels I'm glad I change it up
3,White Cargo,"White Cargo for me was a good, fast read. The blot of this book was very predictable not up to Stuart Woods usual twists and turns. I would recommend it as I said because it is a fast read and I do enjoy his books."
4,comeback for me,"I was getting really tired of the rich boy stone barrington. I actually quit reading stuart woods, but I tried white cargo and really liked it. Worth another shot"
4,Loved it!,I totally enjoyed this book. It grabbed me right away and I didn't want to put it down. Good read.
3,Not even close to believable,"I can't believe this book has a five star rating. The whole thing is just too far-fetched for words. For example, someone wouldn't have 70 million dollars of drug money just unlocked in a closet. Not as bad as Palindrome but close. Swimming to Catalina and Chiefs are much better by this author. Especially Chiefs. I can't believe it was written by the same person."
5,A real page turner! I couldn't put it down!,"I have read several of Woods' books, but this one is the BEST. From the first page to the last, youjust keep wanting more. I was stunned when the phone call came ! Cat is the kind of man every woman wants to marry and every man wants to be. I just wonder why haven't they made this into a movie??"
3,Too much info,"The first half of this book was intriguing. However, once it got into the drug trafficing, it became too involved and quite unbelieveable!"
3,So-so.,"It might work a little, but the difference isn't like night and day. I keep taking it, and while it doesn't improve my focus like, say, a prescription drug would, it does help keep my ability to focus, concentrate, and think clearly a bit more steady rather than unpredictable and all over the place. Recommended, but don't except too much."
3,Does do something...I think,I'm a male in my mid-20s and I didn't find that this helped with focus or mental clarity but I think it is working as an appetite suppressant and my moods seem a little more stable. I re-purchased this supplement and am now on the second bottle.
2,No results to speak of,I didn't notice much of anything. I had high hopes but after finishing the bottle I can't say there was any change. I have taken other supplements like GABA where the effects are very apparent. With this one I might as well be eating M&M's.
2,Few if any effects,"I bought these because I have trouble concentrating and am unwilling to take prescription stimulants like Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall, etc. I took them daily for a while and never found them to be much help, although I did find that they must be taken on an empty stomach to be effective. I would not buy or recommend these.For a similar effect without horse pills, try black coffee, green tea, and / or a low carb diet."
1,Cant handle this product,Makes me nervous. Stopped taking it after one dose. Bought it based on Julia Ross's book. But I realize that even though the combination of vitamins is excellent it does not work for everyone.
2,I thought it was going to be wonderful,"this product has aspertane in it..which wreaks havoc with a child that is ADD or ADHD..so watch what you get...seems we need to monitor everything now..so, this is my worry now"
1,Worthless,"These pills made ZERO noticeable difference and I feel like I wasted my money. Two days after taking them I purchased some other pills called Focusyl, I recommend those ones instead if you are looking for something to help you focus."
3,"Very interesting, but can be better edited","This book is quite Eddie - chatty, witty, and random. He's quite a different person on stage and off, so the book kind of completes my Eddie Izzard collection. I have to admit, though, this publication has slightly too much writing for my taste, or the editor could have done a better job formatting the pages.The photos in the book, unfortunately, are somehow disappointing. It feels like they are taken by a semi-professional photographer, who followed Eddie for one day or two and just wanted to get the work done with. The up side is that the book does have some cute photos from Eddie's childhood.By the way, if you are looking for a biography, try the DVD ""Believe: The Eddie Izzard Story""."
3,Izzard Book Review,"I am satisfied with the content of this book. I must note that I was not informed before the purchase of the book that it had writing in it, but in general, I got the book I paid to get and I do not regret the purchase. For those who are fans of Eddie Izzard, the book may be rambly, but that is Eddie's style. It was obviously dictated to the ghost writer, and the pictures were all from one or two days of Eddie carting around a photographer, but if you are hungry for Eddie, this fluff read is rather a cute one."
2,Dress to Kill only slightly wounds,"I was expecting a biography, but in fact the books is a sort of written version of Eddie's onstage ramblings. The chatty, slang-filled and unfocused style makes him seem much less intelligent and more self-indulgent than he really is. The photographs are also a bit of a disappointment, since they make a leap from childhood/adolescence to the period of the Dress to Kill performance, with nothing in between. The most recent photos seem to mostly be casual snapshots of him wandering the streets of New York and San Francisco. Eddie Izzard is a genius in his craft, brilliantly perceptive, and a great humanitarian. Someone of his substance and uniqueness deserves a better record of his life and career. One can only hope that one will come later."
1,Poor,"This album initiated keak da sneaks fall off. It's his firts album with his current label and it is 100 percent garbage. None of the beats are characteristic of Keak's old stuff, they all sound like bootleg neptunes productions. The only good song on the album is the last track ""Life Ain't Playin With You"" featuring a gospel Agerman. Like Bart's Block Repot, Retaliation is filled with bunch of horrible guest appearences. I love Keak and I love 3x Krazy, but the lyrics, beats and concepts are nothing compared to old school Keak. I wouldent pay $... to get a burned copy of this failure of an album."
4,New Jersey Gazetteer Review,"I bought this book for a very specific purpose, locating local lakes and waterways and determining their source and where they led. This book has served its purpose well.The pages are designed so that enough detail of surrounding areas can be examined without having to change pages (a big problem with folding maps that when unfolded become unwieldy and difficult to manage). Significant detail is included for each page, including smaller streams and back roads.A great feature included in the first pages of the book is a listing of many campgrounds, fishing spots, scenic places, and hunting locations. Each with a table denoting what each location has available, such as whether a specific fishing location has a boat ramp.Once again, this book has served the purpose I intended for it. It could serve as your ""I'm lost"" or ""Road Closed"" map in your car (although too big for my glove box) or it could be your resource to a multitude of outdoor activities throughout the state."
5,Great Buy!,"This golf net was purchased for my little boys age 5 and 3 who love to golf. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. Both my husband and I have been using it too because it is really a great net, especially for the price. My husband did put a hole thru the target but that is just plastic and it is no big deal. My boys spend hours hitting at this and have both hit the target several times. Great addition to the back yard!"
5,Great product,"I have used this foundation for years with great results. It's light, unscented, oil-free and gives beautiful, even coverage. I'm totally pleased with it."
5,Great set,"Great set love it, works well, got it on time, packaged well no problems at all. Bought the disposable bags to go with it. Very nice."
4,Still Learning to Use - But They Must Be Great for The Experienced Pastry Chef,So many choices!! I am a beginner. I probably should not have been quite as ambicious as this. If you are good at piping you will probably use all of them. I am best at sort of splurting straight on. So I use the shaped tips to make stars and the like. I get many compliments as if I spent hours. The tip with the largest round opening works well for plain round cookies that might use for whoopies pies.
5,"AppleStore ""Genius"" raved","I used this enclosure to house my imac's hard drive for a while while it was in the repair shop at the AppleStore. The tech there saw this enclosure when they swaped my drive and said, ""Wow, that's a nice one."" He seemed to say it had a nice internal wiring and options like the audio out (if you used it for a CD-ROM drive etc... Has functions superbly for me."
2,Not good for video capture,"This drive kit would fail when I captured my video from my DV camcorder. I used this drive kit to convert my ATA-100 hard drive to external IEEE 1394 drive for video capture and editing under Windows XP. The installation is easy and Windows XP can detect it without any problem. But when I tried to capture the data from my DV camcorder, this drive would stop DV from sending data. Moreover, the data captured in the drive was damaged. I checked up the web site and found the other users have the similar problem. Help yourself to find the other better storage solution."
2,Mount needs to be fixed,"The mirror itself is superior to others I've seen,but the mount does not stay in position because thejoints are not tight enough to hold the mirror in some positions.I tried using an Alan wrench to tighten the joint but couldn't tighten itenough. I almost broke the Alan wrench trying to tightening the joint.I'm still trying looking at other ways to fix it.For as much as I paid, I would have thought I would get abetter product!I don't think I would have bought it knowing what I know now."
3,not bad so far,"I haven't broken it or had any problem thus far. It doesn't quite spray like I had expected it, however, and it has to be refilled often if you use olive oil to cook a lot. Once in a while it will give me spurty sprays instead of a mist.All in all, though, I've really enjoyed it and appreciate not having to use that chemical-laden stuff in the cans."
3,Worked fine at first....,"After a while it spit oil more than sprayed. I've tried everything to get it cleared out, but no luck."
3,Probably better for lemon juice,This didn't work better than drizzling oil from the bottle itself. The pump seemed to clog easily. It works in spurts (no pun intened). I like the idea but it ended up NOT being a time saver.
1,Misto - big disappointment!,"This thing is too difficult to use! I pump and I pump, but sometimes all that comes out is air, even though I've refilled canister. Other times, it squirts out very poorly...with squirts that are like sloppy spits. I don't recommend this Misto sprayer at all."
1,Works great for about a month,"This item worked wonderfully for about a month. Now it only emits a stream, even though it hasn't been overfilled. Nothing seems broken or damaged, it just doesn't spray. Pretty worthless."
1,Lousy,".... Messy, inconsistent and really difficult to work with. It is unable to handle any impurities in the oil (such as garlic or pepper bits) since they will clog the spray nozzle making it a ($) non-recyclable garbage item. The way to go would be a basting brush and a small shallow bowl to mix the oil and other spices together. Stay away from Misto!"
1,Pretty but useless - get a spray bottle instead,"You can buy ten good plastic spray bottles for the price of a Misto, and they will each last longer and work better that it does.Even with regular cleanings, the Misto malfunctioned after about a month. Then pieces fell off. Then it leaked all over my cupboard.Bye-bye, Misto! Into the trash with you!"
3,not exactly what i expected,"i would rather use a regular pump spray bottle than this particular sprayer. you can't just pick it up and spray, you have to pump it up and down a few times, spray, then you have to unscrew the cap to releive the pressure to put the cap back on to store it. it requires too much maintainence for my style of cooking. so this sprayer is not exactly what i expected."
1,Less than one star,If I could rate this product less than one star I would. I bought one of these for spraying olive oil for cooking. It doesn't spray so much as it shoots out a stream of oil. I'm considering using it for a self defense device - simply spray a stream of olive oil in the perps face! This is actually the second one of these I bought. The first one did the same thing. I thought it was a defect and decided to try again. I... got the same results. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! YOU'LL BE SORRY!
2,Smells strongly of epoxy inside & worried about BPA's,"Epoxy & BPA infused oil is not what i was goin for =( Bummer because it could have been made without those. It does spray a fine mist that i will put to use somehow. Maybe a pillow or room spray, or a plant mister, or to mist myself with oil/water in the summer, or for hair products...anything but spraying poison on my food =("
4,Save $5 and buy direct from Misto,Amazon is a rip off on this particular product. I just bought this from www.misto.com directly for $14 plus $4 in shipping. Amazaon totals $25. What a joke.
3,good while it lasted,"I loved this when I first got it - it was just the right thing to put a tiny dab of oil on my cast iron frying pans before using them, and made oiling muffin pans a trivial spritz. We kept it clean with regular dishwashing soap cycles (a gummed up nozzle will stream, not spray), and it had an honored place next to the stove.Then, the bottom of the plunger tube cracked off (not the whole tube, which pulls out of the cap for cleaning, just the flange around the bottom). So, we bought another one. Then the flange on that one cracked off. So, we gave up.Maybe it wouldn't have happened if we'd used a lighter oil than olive oil, or maybe our local Lechters had a bad batch. But, more likely, the design of this toy is just not particularly good. If you want to buy a new one every six months, go for it. If not, stick to the paper towel method for lightly oiling pans."
5,Wonderful Misto,"I bought this to go with my new Calphalon Contemporary non-stick pan set. They recommended the use of one of these. I had never used one before and had always meant to get one, but had put it off until I had to get one. Using Extra Virgin Olive Oil is very expensive, but so much more heathier for you, and this works excellent. You fill it 1/2 full of Olive Oil, then before you use it you pump and prime it and it sprays ""just enough"" oil on your pans after pre-heating. So you don't waste any precious oil and your food doesn't float in it!!I love it and wish I had gotten it sooner. I got an extra one as a gift and plan on buying more for gifts. It is the best gadget to have in your kitchen and everyone should have one."
2,No longer mists - steady stream,"I've had this item for about 6 months and it is litterally falling apart. First the glue failed where the top part of the pump tube attaches to the metal top. Then it started leaking oil around the cap/gasket and, now, the latest problem is that it no longer mists the oil, now it comes out in one steady, rather large stream (like a fire hose). I should also point out that I have only used this approximately once or twice per week, during the 6 months."
5,Nice Product!,"Most everything has been mentioned about this product's advantages and disadvantages. It doesn't exactly ""mist"" but small droplets are quite acceptable for most applications I've used it for. It is susceptible to damage so follow the directions for only filling half way (3 ounces) and gently pump the top - you need to experiment for the amount you'll be using. It might have been useful if the manufacturer had been more specific in their directions. It says: ""Pump top cap until firm."" Just remember this isn't a piece of exercise equipment. I too think this is overpriced at $ but we found it for under $ thus the FIVE STAR rating. Shop around."
3,Not as useful as I would have hoped,It is a nice product and easy to fill. But I'm not a huge fan of the way it sprays. and the pump is a pain.Buy Pam.
4,A nifty gadget for cooks,I must admit I don't use the Misto as often as I had anticipated/hoped but it works well. I do clean out the spray part when I've not used it for a while in case it's gotten gummy; otherwise the oil tends to blurp out.
1,do not buy this,"I've had 3 of these over the past 5 years and after a while they always spurt and never spray. I think I have learned my lesson by now. If I could find an email or address for this product, I would tell them what I think, but unfortunately, I cannot find one. Don't waste your money on this. I had to give this product a rating and I wouldn't have given it one star but it wouldn't accept my comment without one. It doesn't deserve any stars for a rating"
2,Not for olive oil,"I've had two of these stop working when used with olive oil, sadly, though the canola oil one is still going strong."
1,crap - useless crap,"not worth the trouble, holds hardly any liquid, seemingly needs to be cleaned after every use. waste of money. stay away."
1,Doesn't work. Hard to impossible to clean,"Creates a stream of oil rather than a spray. I found it impossible to completely clean the internal parts, causing the oil to eventually go rancid and ruin the sprayer."
3,Not As Good As I'd Hoped...,"The Misto sprayer is a pain to use because you have to pump it. If you pump it just a few pumps, the droplets will be big. To get a fine spray you have to pump it more. Then you'll have excess pressure in the can that causes the top to rise.Although I like the idea of the Misto, I find myself reaching for the Pam can more often than not."
2,Disappointing,"This text adequately covers the range of childhood and adolescent disorders and acts as a generalist text in this area. However, the references appeared to be largely out of date and the reader is left wondering if the information presented is current. The sections on treatment and assessment were brief and provided little useful information."
3,Blah,"It sad thought that any fan should have owned every album that these song come on.Its not a bad collection its just ""obvious""The group selection is almost too easy with a ton of big names and some groups who should have hit big.All MTV really did was take a dozen tracks that have already proven themselves popular with big videos .. and throw them together ..The album does have a good variety though .."
3,Ok,"This album is not that great. It has some interesting music on it, and one or two songs I play on occasion, but it is pretty mediocre. Look elsewhere for kick ass beats or journeys through sound."
4,An artifact of '97 Electronica,"It's funny, in looking back at this CD, I feel some peculiar nostalgia in listening to what folks in 1997 believed was the future of music.As for the content, there are some essentials. Underworld's ""Pearl's Girl"" still melts my cortex with its synth line that ebbs like amniotic fluid. The tracks by Photek and Apex Twin are still great abstract electronica(see the Mille Plateaux label for further excursions.) There are also some overproduced misfires like the Chemical Brothers remix of ""Voodoo People and the Chrystal Method's work that sounds like Musak for future ""extreme sports"" commericals(whoops! it did.)Overall, Amp marks a time when MTV had this brief period of innovation before the advent of the Boy Bands and Total Request Live."
3,"Don't get too excited by the first track, it don't last.","The Chemical Brothers save MTV! With the exception of the first track and the Chem. Bros. remix of Prodigy's Voodoo People this album is nothing to get excited about. If you're not familiar with techno it's an okay starting point, especially if you're dying to know which ""artists"" are the worst. If you are familiar with techno, stop reading this review and RUN AWAY! Go buy another Chemical Brothers CD or just listen to the one you have now and don't waste your time on this lame CD. Way to go MTV! Keep it up and you may be able to narrow your number of viewers to two. As far as AMP, count me out!"
5,A great addition to my design/ inspiration library,"Let's face facts- I am both a textile and sewing book/design book tramp. The more the better I say! The only problem is space- we're running out of it. Now I am forced to think long and hard about every item I bring into our tiny home. ""Do I need it? Can I use it? Will it inspire me?"" If I answer yes to at least two of the three listed questions, then I'm good to go and have a clear conscience about making the purchase. This book definitely answers the last two of the three questions listed. It will allow the reader to open their mind, look at textiles in a whole new light, and encourage you to not only use what you already have stored in the back of your supply closet but also possibly take an item and repurpose it in a way that contrasts its original life (A faux fur coat turned into a footstool slipcover? Who knew???) I enjoy turning the pages of Vintage Fabric Style and seeing where the ideas take me that day."
2,"A great abdominal workout, but not for the right reasons","The real title of this video is Zhor's Magical Tour Of The Ancient Art Of Bellydance. Reviewer K. Allison writes, ""I'm a sweetheart, so I guess I'll start by saying that my copy of this video won't soon see the trashcan. It's just too much fun. As we all dearly know, bellydancing can be the sexiest of stuff. Not so, however, in the hands of Zhor. For one thing, he might lay off the baba ganoush this Christmas. But like most white, male belly dancers from Chattanooga, Zhor means well and we sure do love him for it. That said, be forewarned: learning a single dance move from this 30 minute flurry of inanity would require the most exotic agility with the remote control. And don't forget your breathing exercises for holding back the yuks. Not recommended."""
3,That man from Northeast,"Yeah he is aight, & they say DC folks dont have good MC's. Man they just dont know. Black is aight, if he gets some PRO type production he will be ok. His lyrics is kinda elementary but he has a MC's mentality. The beats carry this album a long way. I like ""Holdin it Down"" ""Psyhce Em Up"" & ""Hoe Card"""
5,comprehensive with a pleasant authorial voice,"I bought this book because I was thinking about getting a kitten. This book had everything I think I'll need to know to be a conscientious kitten owner (or, at least, I'll find out after taking the plunge!). The book is written in personable language and is peppered with anecdotes about the author's own cat, so it feels more like having an informative conversation with a veteran cat owner than slogging through a tedious cat manual. At least, that's my opinion. Also, the kindle version was good, with few typos."
3,Useful and entertaining,"I bought this book on Kindle when I got my first kitten in over 20 years. I honestly had no idea what to do with it! I liked this book because it told me a lot of things I didn't know, but unfortunately, it is a bit thin on... well, everything... so it wasn't useful when I started to have problems with kitten behaviour, alas. It is a guide, so don't buy it thinking it's got absolutely everything in spades - it doesn't. It does touch on pretty much everything in some way, though, so it is still useful to point you in the right direction. And, for the 'feline virgin', it was a useful read and one that enlightened me about the cat and how we have developed our relationship with it over the years. Oh, and all those kitten pictures throughout are just adorable!!"
4,A good reference guide,"Honestly, there is nothing within the book that is not common-sense with regard to animal rearing, but I found it to be a good 'reminder' read as I prepared to bring home two new kittens. I would recommend the book."
4,A bold new frontier,"The first track, ""Anagrama,"" may be a succinct summary of all that SY has done right with their last two albums, Washing Machine and 1000 Leaves. And when the drums finally kick music never sounded more glorious and frightening. Move over Zarathustra.But contrasting the ethereal high of 'Anagrama' is the blatent and loud closer. The final track, ""de corrosion,"" does just that. It is a maelstrom of flanged noises: pick scrapes and squeals, light snare, and even the perennial distorted rock chord. Are we looking at a taxonomy of sonic possibilities? Are these sounds to be taken as field studies for something more glorious? The flanger never sounded so fresh.I think that it is fitting that Geffen has released SY from their contract just when the band is reaching new heights. Geffen can look for the next teen sensation and we'll stick with the youth."
5,...,"If you don't like this EP, I don't see how you can like Sonic Youth much in general unless you have to hear vocals. These bizarre explorations find Sonic Youth at their best. Some strange guitar noises to be sure, but actually not nearly as grating as some of their other music."
1,Horendouse,"my advisory to anyone who thinks about buying this, DONT. I love sonic youth but if you buy this your wasting your money.But i do recomend the import album ""energy"", it rules.The other ep's are the same, take my advise.If any member of snk yth sees this sorry to be so harsh."
2,Junk?,"Don't get me wrong, i'm a BIG BIG fan of Sonic Youth and the experimental one, not the grunge one of Dirty. My fav is Daydream Nation and NYC ghosts and flowers is great! I also very like all the other SYR relases...But, this one is a total weak one. It really sound like bad jams and forgotten tapes filled with ""clichés"" of the band weird sequences of noise. Nothing new is explored during the first tracks. The last track is not bad, but that's it. Go get SYR 2 which is MUCH better and deeper."
2,Weak plot,"This is by far the weakest of the first three Fu movies (the British films). The plot turns on Fu's substituting a look-alike for Neyland Smith. Though he looks like Commissioner Smith, he acts like a zombie - and no one seems to notice! The plot is just too stupid to be entertaining. Give this one a skip unless you need to complete your Fu collection."
5,A Hidden Gem!,"When I first heard this band play live, now called the Sean Philbin Band, I was totally amazed! I have followed their progress over the last few months and I must say this band is on their way.The entirely original music is pure, honest and harmonic. This is a refreshing change from the current pop music scene. This band reminds me of John Hiatt, Bruce Springsteen, the Eagles and some James Taylor, however, they are definitely originals!This is a CD to own and enjoy, and also a band to follow. They are such a great band live! If you live in the Seattle area, you should watch for them!"
3,From another time and place,"The album is performed by the Boston Camerata and is reflective of Christmas music performed throughout Europe in mostly the 15th & 16th centuries. The music is a hallmark of what people would hear in the old European churchs at Christmas time. Much of it takes the form of church hymns inside church walls, which makes it a little more authentic. Some songs are instrumental and some are sung, and the languages vary, like French, German, Latin. The booklet inside provides the lyrics and English translations along with a little history of each song. For me, it's nice to hear ancient Christmas songs, to think about how long this holiday has been celebrated; it helps drive home the true meaning of Christmas."
4,Pretty Good for a compilation....,"Contains many of the essential BOC favorites, RE-RECORDED and mildly reworked. Conspicuously absent are master pieces like ""The Last Days of May,"" ""Before the Kiss,"" ""Golden Age,"" ""The Vigil, ""Perfect Water,"" ""I love the Night,"" and so on.Also, not to quibble or anything, but ""Harvest Moon"" is absent. Written 3-4 years prior to the release of ""Classics"" one would think it would be in the line up.Also, the album art is courtesy of Melne Murphey (formerly Melne Gregmar).Good stuff even if it is the umpteen gazillionth ""Best of"" release."
5,Perfect!,First time using a 3-inch pan and had no problems at all. Cake turned out perfectly (I baked it from scratch and was a little nervous) I used this for my son's individual first birthday cake for him to mess and devour :)
3,"Neither ""super"" nor ""badass""","This is an odd one. The titular character ( played self-indulgently by the writer and director, Charles Cullen) is a fashion-challenged, southern-drawling long-haired dork we are supposed to accept as a fearsome bounty hunter, but ends up being as geekily unbelievable as Steven Seagal .The gore is plentiful and appealing, but the lack of budget shows through like a cold sore through makeup. The minimalism of some of the interior sets and shots recall H.G. Lewis at his worst. There is enough humor and irreverence to show promise, but the slapdash story and lack of cohesiveness ultimately undermine this low-budget effort."
1,Took for ever.,"I have used this product before, it's a very good product. This time it took forever to get and it smelled bad. Good thing I only received one, because I ordered two."
5,Excellent guide for your End Times study,"This book is a blessing and I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious in their studies of the End Times. Harris first confronts the Tribulations through a Biblical perspective. Next, Harris addresses the many false doctrines which have found their way into the mainstream Christian church. After debunking heresy, an analysis of the timing of the Great Tribulations commences, mapping out the events of the seven years. A much needed study, Harris then compares the natural temple to the spiritual temple. Harris concludes Tribulation or Triumph with an in depth study of the Book of Daniel, the Church's role in the Tribulations, and a chapter by chapter breakdown of the Book of Revelations."
2,Watered Down,"This book is just a very watered down version of his three excellent books, Return of the Warriors, Cry of the Eagle, and Mists of Dragon Lore. It seems as if it was written as mass consumption fluff. If you want to get down to business, check out his other three books."
2,This Darned Elusive Happiness,"The content was very fast to read. Didn't care for the paper it was printed on. Made letters look fuzzy with the cotton content. Maybe I've read too many self-help books about relationships and life, but I was disappointed with this work. I have read the previous writings (highly recommend) and couldn't wait to read this book, but unfortunately, it didn't resemble previous works."
1,A suprise,"I am nor sure what this book is trying to do, it is quite flimsy on philosophy and has its premise that happiness is elusive(?), but doesn't get to grips with telling the reader why the author believes this. And this to my mind would be the first place to make a bold statement.Nor does the book tie in well with his other books which one might agree with or disagree with, but at least the sentiments in those books are expressed strongly .This book may be a beginners intro to certain toltec teachings.Useful in places but very light read."
5,great blanket,Bought this as a gift and is great! Definitely worth the price as it is a great value for the quality.
4,Good but not for the beginner,"This book is well written and worth the money. But, this book is not for the beginner in anthropology of religion. It is a good one to buy but wait till you have the timeline of the various religions and cultures worked out in your mind before reading. Ha Ha a timeline handy might be a good Idea as well, I kept looking one up on the net."
1,The only book I would have returned for a refund.,"What a major disappointment. Nothing special. Don't waste your money! If you cannot accomplish what this book advises on your own with a few checklists because of time or career constraints, save the money on the book and hire a good administrative or personal assistant that you can use for this and other tasks."
1,A true all-American snoozefest,"Mallon is a fine critic and a lively esaayist, but he should avoid fiction at all costs. This boring novel reeks of research and intellectualism but lacks the passion to make it of human interest. Histiry buffs might enjoy, but the rest of us? No way."
3,"A darned good flick, and Ursula Andress is stunning, as always","I saw this film a long time ago when it was released in theaters, and I really enjoyed it. Although it does not slavishly follow the story in the H. Rider Haggard classic of the same name, it is close enough. The story is simple. Three British adventurers on a quest for immortality stumble onto a mysterious society ruled by Queen Ayesha (Andress) who is ""She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed."" Ayesha believes that one of the Brits, Leo Vincy, is the reincarnation of her former lover, who she killed in a jealous rage a thousand or so years earlier. (Ayesha is immortal.) There is more to the story, and in fact it all makes for a pretty good yarn.I do not know why this one is not presently available on DVD, and I hope that it soon will be, as this is a pretty decent adventure flick, and the gorgeous Andress of course gives the viewing extra zippity-do-da."
3,They Don't Make 'Em Like Ursula Anymore,The sight of Ursula Andress alone makes this movie worth viewing. She has to be the most gorgeous actress to ever grace a movie screen. British horror vets Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee lend capable support.
3,sorte de peplum tité du roman de h ridder-haagart,un des premiers rles d'ursula dans le registre reine cruelle. le scénario est classique mais le film est bien construit et la belle suissesse fait preuve de conviction dans un role ou le risque du ridicule n'était pas mince
3,"""SHE"" on dvd","excellent dvd, however did NOT receive the same cover as shown in advert. Guess i'm stuck with the different cover. Received the UK cover instead :("
5,They say a moth is attracted to a flame,"Well not quite the novel ""She"", by Henry Rider Haggard, but a little closer than earlier versions this movie and is quit fun to watch.Three men back from the war, Maj. Horace Holly (Peter Cushing), Job (Bernard Cribbins), and Leo Vincey (John Richardson) are just aching for adventure. While having a good time in the local bar in Palestine, Leo is vamped by a beautiful exotic girl Ustane (Rosenda Monteros.) He gets abducted and is confronted by a mysterious and mesmerizing timeless beauty Ayesha (Ursula Andress). She gives him a ring and a map and she says ""find me."" His friend sees the ring and the map and says treasure. So they are off in the desert. They will soon find more than they expected, and so shall we.The story does not quite follow the book but the adventure is still there."
4,This is buy far the best Version of SHE yet...,"I recieved my copy of She on DVD, quiet promptlly enough, and I watched it that day, This verision with Ursula Andress, is the best one I'v ever seen . I seen it many years ago, I never forgot how Incredably Beautiful this Woman was, You might remember her from the sene in the James Bond Flic , on the beach ,where she 's comming out of the Sea up on to the Beach, Anyway she , no pun Intended, dose the part to perfection, Hammer Films did a real nice job on this Movie, I had a Bigger Budget for this one than most of the movies they made, Color is very good, reasonably sharp picture, although I must admit that I WAS USING a Blue ray player to watch this. It neariy looked high Def-, I was very pleased with this DVD. Now I normally only but blueray Movies these days . Nice to get this though, Probably never see it on blueray anyway....."
3,"Good , but i like the 1935 version better...","MGM is quite a studio, and tried to capture the magic of SHE with actors likeChristopher Lee and Peter Cushing and the very beautifull Urula Andrews...Ive see both the 1935 and this version. The 1935 version wins.In this version, we have some great scenery at the beginning. They filmed atdifferents sites and the quality shows up in the movie. All is good till we meetSHE who must be obeyed.1. The natives in the 1935 version were kinda scary.The natives in this version looked like they just came out of the face paintingshop, and their dancing felt more like a musical instead of being threatening...2. The soldiers wore Roman hats, shields.....??? what was that all about.3. The Voice of SHE (i just learned this) was Dubbed.Still sounded small, and the sound of autority just was'nt there.From the moment SHE started to talk, the movie went down from there.Still a good movie to watch and keep. But its sure aint on the samelevel of the 1935 version."
2,"""She"" was better in my memory than in this movie","I fondly remembered ""She"" from 1965 when it first came out. Of course I was all of 11 years old then and thought it one of the best movies I ever saw! But after viewing it again this month, I now know why some say the memory is much better than reality. But don't let that stop you from watching it... (although it would be a better rental than purchase. Better yet, I'll sell you my copy for $10 plus shipping!)"
2,Mbele,This was a movie i had seen when I was a child and had always wanted to see again. I am glad I was able to see it again but it has not really stood the test of time even though it is based on a book by the famous author Sir H Rider Haggard who wrote King Solomon's Mines. But still worth a look.
3,"Product is good, but why so expensive?",You can by this same size box at Sam's club for less than 1/2 this price?
4,A fascinating read!,"Mr. Piontek doesn't ""dumb down"" his writing. His work is for the serious student of trends in GLBT history and sociology."
4,"Lots of tips, very pale colors","I purchased this set since it seemed the best value for the money. There are a large variety of tip sizes and shapes, and the included booklets explain how to use them for different effects. A smoothing spatula and supply of plastic pastry bags are also included.The one thing I haven't used much of is the colorings. They are all pale pastels: pink, baby blue, violet, etc. The colors would be great for decorating cakes for a baby shower, small child's birthday, Easter, or maybe certain weddings; but they aren't much use for me. If I ever need a pale color, I am used to making it by just using a very small amount of a darker color, so I don't know why they didn't include brighter primary colors, rather than already diluted ones."
3,Not for beginners!,"It looks like it would be a good buy. But it really wasn't for me. I purchased this a few months ago when I began decorating cakes. The only thing good I can say about the set is the book was very helpful and easy to follow. The food coloring, while professional coloring, was very hard to use (no dropper), measure (no dropper) and horribly stained everything it came in contact with. It is not for beginners! And while you do get a good assortment of tips - you may find that you do not use half of them. I found I could pick out tips at my local Five and Dime Store for less than a dollar. And if you are considering getting this as a gift for a cake decorating enthusiast, chances are they already have all the tips they would have used from this set."
4,Nice starter set,"This is a good starter set if you are just getting into cake decorating. The instruction book is nice. It lists some pretty good ideas that look fairly easy. I wish the off-set spatula was a little bigger, but overall very nice."
5,CAKE DECORATING,I BROUGHT THIS FOR OUR 13 YEAR GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE HAS ALREADY STARTED USUNG IT TO DECORATE CUPCAKES THIS WAS A GREAT BUY
5,Inexperienced users will have a lot of fun,Ive been decorating cakes for fun for a few years now. Im no pro but I bought this to help learn. Im sure it would be easier for a pro to use but not knowing the proper way to use the tools (you tube helped a lot!) it was tricky. BUT also a lot of fun and so much to experiment with! For the price you cant beat it! I LOVE this product and look forward to using it again and again =)
4,Even the greatest item has flaws,"This is a great product, but the plastic disposable bags stretch and tear. It's a little difficult to keep a constant pressure on the plastic bags."
4,"It was great, but...","I love that I got this, but the inner packaging was way different than the picture shows. In the picture, everything has it's own little snap in-able spot, but the tray that came with mine, there was just a big well to hold the tips.But it came with everything I wanted, and I'm using it lots!"
5,Great product for any baker.,Really like the ease of use and the variety of the tips. The plastic icing bags are a little small. You can ice about 8 cupcakes at a time so I'll be picking up some larger ones down the road. Great product overall.
5,Wilton cake decorating kit,I needed a new kit that had all the parts! This is a great kit. It comes with a lot of tips and the book gives you great directions. The price makes it a great bargain.
5,great value....,"For the price, i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this little package. I have a relatively old computer - p3 500 w/ 192mb ram, and a 16mb voodoo3 video card - all on windows 98.The card installation was a breeze, and the installed software was great. I had my first movie made in two days.I've used this for a month now w/ no complaints. Highly recommend it."
3,A Firewire card is not a video capture card!,"To anyone who thinks that this card allows you to capture analog video from your VCR, DVD or TV, think again! This is simply a Firewire interface for your PC; it does not have analog inputs for audio/video and does not perform analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion."
4,Great Self Defense,This DVD gives you great training and self defense. He shows you different scenarios that you can be facing in real life and how to defend yourself in them.
4,"Not perfect, but great instruction!","This is a great instructional video! The quality of production isn't great, but the instruction is clear and shone from a few angles. Sound quality is passable, but again not great. You'll be happy that we don't have TVs that relay odor because Loren is drenched by the end of his workouts. They are hard hitting and packed with real world applications.I highly recommend this video! Start working out now just to get ready to unleash these great techniques."
3,Good to learn some new concepts but ....,First of all the positives:1. This is the only kickboxing DVD I have seen which helps you apply your knowledge in potentially challenging situations.2. The instructor is very knowledgeable. He comes across as very genuine - that is something that makes the video good to watch.However:1. This is a poorly produced video. There is just too much talk and there are no routines that you can follow with the instructor on the screen. You are supposed to watch learn and follow on your own.It still makes the DVD useful- it is just that it makes it tough to follow.2. The other issue is that my DVD jumps around and skips material - I am yet to check it on another player.
2,Poor Quality DVD,"Having purchased his other book on Speed Training, I was eagerly awaiting this DVD.Well it was quite a disappointment. For the quality of the video and instruction, I was better off using YouTube. The video was very poor in showing the techniques, did not show different angles and at times when the female instructor was on the video you could not even see some of the moves. If you are a Christensen groupie then you should buy it. If you plan on using this as a part of solo training, once again you will find better for free off the internet and YouTube.Very disappointing."
1,"The Second Worse ""Gypsy"" Recording","Tyne Daly's ""Gypsy"" used to be the worst recording of this glorious musical. But records are meant to be broken and the bottom of the barrel was lowered considerably by Bernadette Peters and company. Okay, let's ignore the rare Kay Medford LP because it's a travesty. As long as the perfect Original Broadway Cast recording is still easily available, there is no reason to get another recording of ""Gypsy"" unless you want the fun of comparing other stars to the glorious Ethel Merman. That said, I hope there will be a Patti LuPone recording because she has the vocal heft to carry it off."
1,Why Her!!!,"I gave it one star because you can't give things zero stars. Tyne Daly can't sing at all. Who directed this revival they should be shot for cast Tyne Daly. She's nothing compared to Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Bette Midler and Bernadette Peters! She sounds breathy and as if she's forcing the notes out of her mouth. She sings from her nose and throat. Why do some of you people think she can sing? Have you heard no better. This recording makes me ill."
5,A great read,"Great stuff here. The characters are interesting, diverse, believable, and well defined. The plot has twists and turns without being forced. The style and use of language is a pleasure to read. Incredibly, the style is completely different from Knoerle's other stuff, unlike other writers who turn out the same book over and over again.If you liked Crystal Meth Cowboys you'll like The Violin Player. If you *didn't* like Crystal Meth Cowboys you'll *still* like The Violin Player."
3,Not at her best!,"This show is nowhere near as good as her first one, ""The child ain't right."" I laughed a couple of times in this one but overall I didn't like it much."
3,Fascinating but flawed,"If you grew up watching University of Miami dominate college football (as I did) this is a fascinating review of how the program was built up from nothing and then sustained itself across multiple head coaches into the 1990's. But where the film fails is in its unapologetic look at the behavior of some of the players. Robert Bailey's obvious glee at purposely knocking out another player is one example. Randall Hill refusing to take responsibility for imbecilic post-TD idiocy at the Cotton Bowl is another. While I applaud the work done by guys who came out of troubled neighborhoods, I also know basic sportsmanship and right and wrong. To justify that behavior behind quasi-rascist screen of ""cultural differences"" is an insult to the audience."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,I absolutely love it!!! It came early so i really loved that! Ive watched it on ESPN every time it came on & now i can watch anytime i want!! The BEST documentary EVER!! Because it has and ALWAYS will be ALL BOUT DA []_[] BABY!!!
4,The U film,"This is a good film that does not hide from the negatives about the football program. This school does have a tradition of athletes that are not true students, but exceptional football players. To fully understand the college football phenomena, one must first look at where the players come from, and it is a soul searching eye opening trip that may make some look away, but make others sit up and take notice that the world is not a pretty place to live."
5,The U,I ordered this tape as a gift for my daughter. She absolutely loves it. The tape was brand new. Excellent for football fans!!!
5,1982,"Statik and Term are the sickest duo since pete rock and cl smooth. This album is one of the freshest cd i picked up in 2010. If you do not have this album, you need to cop it."
2,good lyrics over awful beats (2.5 stars),"And to think that I took time to listen 1982 because of Statik...I've never heard this guy Termanology before but I'm quite following Statik's career since the days he dropped those infamous mixtapes featuring Nas and others estabilished artists.I know Statik got a good ear to beats but in 1982 I don't know what happened...first 4 tracks r fire but the rest of the cd is a huge downhill minus a track here and there. This kid Termanology for sure know how to rhyme, he got good lyrics, nothing complicated or fancy, he goes straight to the point and I apreciate that, plus he got a nice flow.The guests do their thing too especially Xzibit but the major problem of the album is the production. I definitelly won't listen again, it's one of the corniest releases of this year, and to someone who describes himself as the hottest producer out, Statik lost major points, he needs to step his producer game up and quickly."
3,warning,The item that was shipped was not the item that was advertised. I received a different label with missing tracks.
5,Wow!,"If you're new to Yes music, then get the studio stuff, really. But if you got everything, then start buying this CD! Since we'll never witness the quintesenntial YES line-up again (Anderson, Howe, Squire, Wakeman and Bruford), I prefer not to have Squire but to have plenty of colorful Bruford-drumming! The ABWH tracks are much greater live, and plus you get the ultimate ""Close To The Edge"" live version!"
1,no bass - no fun,"I'm painfully missing Chris Squires bass-fundament on this record. So it sounds to me like the taste of thin coffee, if you know what I mean. For my opinion ""Keys to Ascension"" is the better choice, if you want to have well-sounding live-yes-music."
3,some reason i thought it'd be larger,"this sign fits my dog to a t. some people she loves, others not so much. but i ordered this sign under the assumption it was larger than it really is, especially for the price. i'm going to keep it, for my wife's office to hang over the dogs desk, but dissappointed its so small. was hoping for a bigger impact"
4,GOOD BUT A LITTLE ANTIQUATED,"I'm a clay court tennis player 6.0-6.5This book is a contribution to the strategic view of the tennis game undoubtedly.However, the groundstroke instructions are a little ""old style"" or ""antiquated methods"". Today the biomechanical research, have shown that the wrist must to be involved in all the groundstrokes, like a kinetic chain. This is the reason of the tremendous power in the modern game. Nevertheless, this book is a very ""educational book"" of the world of strategic tennis. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Too technical,"I was thinking it was going to give more strategies - what to do when this is happening, etc. I feel it gets too technical with the strokes, just not what I was looking to get out of the book."
5,An excellent collection of songs by an excellent artist.,"This cd gives us a glimpse of the many facets of Connie's talent, from the her heart-rending version of Mama to her swinging versions of Old Man Mose, and Smack Dab in the Middle. She sings in Italian, Jewish and English. Listening to this cd makes me wish I had been there at the Copa when Connie was performing these songs."
4,great for cheesecake,"This is a great pan for cheesecakes that need to be cooked inside of pan of water (for example, Craig Clairborne's cheesecake recipe). It is heavy duty aluminum with a solid rim. It has worked well for me, and I anticipate that it will last a long time."
2,Thin,"Wilton is usually a great product, but some of their pans are thinner than the rest, and this is one of them. We have some with a straight edge, and this is slightly curved. If this is a new disign, they used less metal, or not as good quality metal.. something's different. I bake 2 8"" at the same time, one with this pan, one with my older version, and this pan turns the cakes brown on the bottom so much faster. Not really happy. We returned it."
2,Unappealing,"To be honest, this voice sounds like a voice major's junior recital--and by that I don't mean the voice sounds fresh. It's incredibly limited in range and almost always harsh on the top. Frankly I'd rather hear Schubert sung by just about anyone else. For these songs skip this one and try Elly Ameling. DeGaetani's pianos and pianissimos are nice but it is hard to understand how she had a career with the instrument she possessed."
1,Where's the help??,"I just finished reading this book, and actually it's outside waiting for the garbage truck to pick it up as I type this!Oh yes, the book told my story! The obsession about a guy in my life, but where's the help I need to 'fix it'?? It basically tells me I need to seek a professional to get over it?!? If I could afford a professional, I wouldn't have bought this book!I was SO into every story, thinking, THAT'S ME! Then I couldn't wait till the point where they told me how to work on this, but NOPE! It never came!So it get's one star from me. Actually, the star is for the person I bought it from through Amazon! They were great! :)"
5,Hard to put down!,"John D. Moore is truly a gifted & talented writer. In this book he exposes the problem of ""Confusing Love with Obsession"" and challenges people everywhere who are in abusive, addictive and unsucessful relationships to take the focus off of the person we are involved with and put it where it can do the most good: On ourselves!If you are dealing with an addiction to another person - THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. At times, you will find yourself having to put the book aside because it is too painful to read...but make sure you pick it up again! Kudos to Mr. Moore, he has written a powerfully clear and meaningful book for women and men everywhere."
3,A rare perk in the middle of medicore or bizarre plots.,"Love finally comes to Alec and Farley handles what could have been a disaster with sensitivity. Carefully skirting sexism, he creates a touching story about what happens when you fall in love. No, this book doesn't have a fairy tale ending (thankfully!) and no it is not mushy but touchs on the very personal ways that people can be changed. A rare treasure in the waning years of the Black Stallion series and a thoroughly unpredicatable and satisfying book."
4,"Good ""G"" Movie Set","Air Bud movies are good solid ""G"" rated kid movies..The later ""Air Buddies"" and ""Snow Buddies"" are my favorites (and the kids) (but not in this set).."
1,Neil MacFarquhar's book degrades Arab women,"Neil MacFarquhar's book is bigoted and anti-Muslim to say the least. He describes Muslim women as living in a tent. This is shameful to say the least, especially since MacFarquhar lived in Lybia he should know better. Reading the book put me to sleep. I coudn't go past 20 pages of this bigoted right-wing claptrap"
2,Some good anecdotes but barely a novel.,"This book sounded great but it soon was apparent that the spine of it -- the reporter's romance with a TV babe -- was clumsy and lacking in chemistry. Obvious targets, such as the Pentagon's managing of the press, the press' boorishness and silliness, (especially broadcast talent) and the shallowness of TV coverage versus that of print coverage are thoroughy worked over. The overall story is episodic and repetitve, and beyond an occasional glimpse into oddities of Saudi soicety, and bits that reveal a new angle on the military, this is repetitive and lacking in insight. Relationships tend to be one-note and dry. The prose is often flat-footed. Worth perusing for some nuggets but as a whole it's got almost no story and offers not much beyond what a good news watcher/reader would have absorbed during the first Gulf War."
3,"cute, useful, but a little traditional","This was a useful little book and the author definitely got some breeds right on, but the training methods she uses are a little ""traditional"" (penny cans to startle dogs, leash corrections...) given the positive methods that are proving so effective. It is also the only place I have seen ""heel"" defined as ""start walking"" rather than a position. Still, I find myself pairing all sorts of phrases with actions and my dog is clearly beginning to understand some of them (she WAITs at curbs until I say it's OK to cross) so much of the information is quite useful...I would just tend to use more ""Playtraining"" like methods, but I have a sighthound."
5,My Go-To on All Things Canine,"Anytime I need an overview on basic dog breeds this is my go-to reference. I use it both to confirm my own observations and to learn about unfamiliar breeds. It has never failed to both educate and entertain. It begins with basic information on how to live successfully with canines. I like that Halliburton gives very accurate insights on negative traits of specific breeds and how to deal with them, including proper training of the Human. Unfortunately, some breeds are unrepresented, like my flat-coated retriever. I was, however, able to obtain a good description from the information on Newfies and Irish setters."
3,a great book for breeds but awful traing info.,"this is one of the best books for breeds but there is just awful training info that i would'int listen to for my life. but like she said you should never use one word comand, overuse the word no or underestimate how smart your dog is. get this book for breed info but try out paul loebs smarter then you think for training info."
1,"Behind the times, and so wrong about many breeds!","The author misquotes so many origins of breeds and misnames so many breeds, her credibility with the reader is immediately suspect.I felt the suggestions were very outdated. I have a multiple-breed household and she was wrong on all three counts. Her suggestions also come off very heavy-handed.I would recommend and much prefer ""Mother Knows Best"" by Carol Lea Benjamin and ""How To Raise A Puppy You Can Live With""."
1,Really,"Please change your model, it's the lamest thing I've seen in my entire life. I really want to buy these but I can due to the lameness of the model."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I was hoping for a fun way to learn about the states, but this DVD is not it. The other stories that accompany it are set to music that is difficult to listen to. The two stars I did give it were for the Star Spangled Documentary, Johnny Appleseed story, and John Henry. I expected more from a Scholastic product."
1,Not One of Their Best,"The first illustrated story about the scrambled states keeps your interest, but the two other illustrations are totally musical, the songs are too long, and get boring. Doesn't hold your interest. Not one of Scholastics' better videos."
4,Good listening music,"Dark, slick and sophisticated drum n bass, Modus Operandi would have made a great accompaniment to the first Dirty Harry movie. A soundtrack of suspense and cool atmospherics. As one would expect from what I presume is called ""minimalist"" drum n bass, there are no real songs to speak of; no vocals either for that matter. Just a pitter-patter of snare, hi-hat and bass drum, a bass and the odd synth pad, sketching the scene of a New York City streetscene late at night. . Although this would appear to be low-key enough to qualify as ambient, oddly enough this is music that needs to be listened to. And it is in fact a really splendid record that is receiving heavy rotation at home. Just four or five tracks at a time, mind you. A little of this stuff goes a long way.If you like this then I would recommend Surgeon for more upbeat fare."
2,This guy must have a microchip instead of a brain,"I have given this album many many chances and have owned it almost two years, and it pains me to say that it just isn't very impressive. There is a block of tracks in the middle that are just undistinguished, making me agree with one insightful critic who wrote that this album was as exciting as ""a tofu milkshake."" The way Photek makes his own drum sounds and beats is very impressive, but the tracks themselves are so repetitive that if you try to play this in the background or just sit and listen to it, you become very conscious of how boring it is--maddeningly boring. This album sounds like it was made for a computer, by a computer. Someone inject a small spark of life into this! Photek proves he can really do a good job of remixing other people's tracks, but too much of his work is about as exciting as watching bark peel off a tree."
1,It's just BORING!,"I hate not to like this CD. No matter how many times I play it I just can't get into the music like I can with Juno Reactor or Orbital. The tracks seem stale and repetative, also not much happens with the music. It's all the same stuff over and over again with nothing new in between."
4,addictive,"i've owned this album for over two years and i still can't stop listening to it. it, literally, is addictive. it's complex, yet simple, patterns and drum loops never get boring. i highly recommend this album."
5,A Drum & Bass Masterpiece by Photek,"Photek, who is definitely one of the best drum & bass artists, creates a hard, mean, humanless breakbeat masterpiece. The music is carefully structured, minimalistic and deeply hypnotic; it takes a while to learn to appretiate it or even to slightly comprehend. Among the masterpieces is the evil, ambient The Hidden Camera, the sensuous Axiom, the thick, mean, agressive repetitive Minotaur, and the beautiful and exotic The Seventh Column which wraps it all up. This is all padded by experimental jazz, and more hard hitting drum & bass tracks with chunky, sharp, ear-damaging metallic snares ( Like the ones in Smoke Rings ). All in all, this is a definite drum& bass best."
4,A captivating electronic work,"This album grabbed me from the beginning with its heavy atmosphere and intricate use of dark synth sounds in a sonically stripped down setting. Photek's transitions are masterful; the songs which do not directly connect complement each other. The drum programming is aggressive but not altogether ""in-your-face."" Photek exercised his talents in crafting this landmark work."
4,"Intelligent, Abstract Music","I've only recently got into electronica, i already own albums by leftfield, prodigy and the chemical brothers, but i really enjoyed this album, it is meticulously crafted and expertly executed and the tune Hidden Camera is a dnb classic although the whole thing is good. I hear mentioned a lot with electronic music that it is ""cold"" and ""inhuman."" But to me Photek's music is more human than whatever slick commercial rock is trendy at the moment, cos his main instrument is the second most human instrument, the drum, like it began in Africa, Modus is full of cranking beats that keep your head nodding like you're listening to Ironman by Black Sabbath. Great, primitive stuff."
3,A little less salt please,"The only way to enjoy these is to take a napkin and brush off as much salt as you can or even rinse them. Once that is done, the flavor is quite good. The individually wrapped sticks are just covered with salt. I'm not sure if I would get them again."
4,good healthy snack,"We have been getting these for awhile. They are as tasty as any other turkey sticks on the market, they are organic and a great protein snack for on the go with the kids (so much better than loading them up on empty carbs alone like cracker snacks). A little salty...but that's the case with almost all jerky type snacks."
5,Must see,"This is a well done video with a light hearted spin on a couple very touchy and timely topics. Gun control, and the war on drugs. Both topics covered very well, with factual references and qualified opinions. Very much worth watching."
5,"Informative and Fun, lots of good points","Very Very thought provoking. Tackles the subject of freedom in a fun yet strikingly simple format. There is no such thing as Half Free.What do you consider your most valuable right. The right to yourself. If you have never considered this topic, you don't know what true freedom is.Get a copy watch it and then share it with your friends, your neighbors and anyone who you can. This is a message that NEEDS to get out.Great video."
3,"Early collection, maybe too early.","With only 11 cuts, this collection of early Tull is really for fans of the radio friendly Tull of the 70's. It has the basics but a real fan will look elsewhere."
3,Here we have it; Another incomplete Tull collection!!!,"Okay...why was nothing included from This Was? If a Song for Jeffrey is, as my freind claims, their first hit...where is it? Come to think of it, what about My Sunday Feeling? What about Bouree? Witch's Promise? Cross Eyed Mary? My God? Shall I go on?What's here is good, for the most part...but it's just incomplete. Following is the ideal M.U. ...1. My Sunday Feeling2. Someday the Sun Won't Shine for You3. A Song for Jeffrey4. New Day Yesterday5. Fat Man6. Bouree7. To Cry You a Song8. Witch's Promise9. Teacher10. Aqualung11. Cross-Eyed Mary12. My God13. Locomotive Breath14. Thick As a Brick (Edit #1)15. A Passion Play (Edit #8)16. Sealion17. Bungle in the Jungle"
1,Hardly Worth the Cost,"Too many better collections (not to mention original LPs) exist, so why pay this much for edited (""Thick as a Brick"" and ""Passion Play"") or rerecorded versions (""Aqualung"" and ""Locomotive Breath"") versions of songs? Only ""Rainbow Blues"" is recommended, as it appears here for the first time anywhere."
3,"Get it just for ""Aqualung""","""Aqualung"" is the best song on this album. It's not too long, (6:35), and the guitar riff at the beginning is awesome. It's Jethro Tull's best song. The others are not as good as ""Aqualung."""
5,The life of Bessie Coleman.,"fly high! is a story of a woman that name is Bessie Coleman who meets a guy that tells her to go to France to learn how to fly.She traveled all over the world , until one day she crashed in California.She was in the hospital for three long months,and was not able to fly for a year.She didn`t give up on flying again.one day she was ready to fly again.A texas mechanic,William Wills,joined her.Bessie didn`t put on her seatbelt,and the plane went out of control.Bessie fell from the plane."
1,Telling Time - The Wrong Way,The edition of the book that my child has contains an error - 12AM and 12PM are labeled incorrectly. So much for proper instruction and editing.
3,Connie Francis in Yiddish,"All well known songs, it is fun to listen and to sing along... the only problem is, that the timbre of her voice does not necessary suit the Yiddish pronunciation. Sometimes it is difficult to follow the (known) text. But it definitely makes fun to listen, the more, its quite unique."
2,DISSAPOINTED,"I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE,THE FORMAT WAS RECORDED IN SLP MODE, WHICH IS NOT THE BEST SOUND, & PICTURE PRODUCTION. BUT THE PRICE WAS EXTREMELY FAIR, WHICH IS WHY I DID NOT RETURN THE ITEM."
3,Credible but average,Fighter who believes he's committed murder goes out West to hide out with the Dead End Kids and an old lady. Good cast attempt their best in this average film.
3,"OK, but does not add up to the original","This one is OK for Halloween perhaps, but not the best of them all. Dracula does not even say anything in this film although the evil is quite effective. Only buy this one if you are a die hard fan of the Hammer ""Dracula"" films. Other than that, renting it at your local video store might be better.This film may have also been better with the presence of Professor Van Helsing, and that's what also made the first film even better."
2,Silence is not golden,"The first sequel to the Horror of Dracula falls way short of the first film. Dracula is accidently revived and reeks havoc on two visiting couples. The sets and costumes are vibrant and catching. The biggest problem with the film is that Christopher Lee does not speak, it does not matter who they are or how good he was in the first film, growling and hissing only go so far. By not giving Lee any lines, this film started out as sub-par and could not hope to dig itself out of the hole. The film does have some interesting action scenes leading to the climax, but the conclusion is very flimsy and hokey. This is a film that eventually falls short of it's mark."
4,really and truly good to the last drop!,"This film is actually not the second but third Dracula film made by Hammer studios, Christopher Lee bowed out of 1960's Brides of Dracula, but returns for this quite chilling sequel. You can tell this is still the sixties, the vampires are still repelled by the crosses and the film is devoutly pious while it is also quite scary! The only thing lacking is the heavy duty sexual content of some of the latter films. The kids can watch this one and will still get a good fright. The film was released in widescreen with the running commentary when it was actually done a couple of years ago on the Laserdisc, although this was lacking on VHS. The colors, film stock is not pristine, but the movie is still presentable. Andrew Keir is memorable as the rough and ready cleric who helps save the day."
3,DPoD - One of Hammer's best Dracula films,"Good production values, excellent photography, fine acting. All this & more makes DPoD well worth your time. Stranded travelers stumble upon an eerie castle & decide to stay a while. Original concept? Hardly. But what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for in other areas. The Count's revivification scene was deemed too shocking by British censors, so was toned down. Still, it packs quite a wallop. Barbara Shelley is marvelous as the proper & prudish Helen, & then deliciously wanton & wicked as the vampiress. Andrew Keir is very good as Father Sandor, this film's version of Van Helsing. That Christopher Lee is able to bring as much to the title character as he does speaks volumes for the man as an actor, seeing that he has no dialogue in the movie! What makes the DVD worth it's weight in gold is the feature length commentary by Lee, Shelley, Suzan Farmer & Francis Matthews. You'll hear Hammer insider info not found anywhere else."
5,GOOD MOVIE,"I really enjoyed this movie.Four people accidently stumble upon Dracula's castle and spend the night there.Two manage to escape and seek the help of a priest to destroy Dracula once and for all.The scene where the guy gets his throat slit while hanging upside down was pretty gory,especially for 1965,although I didn't mind seeing him get killed or his wife because they were snobs.The young couple that survived were cool."
5,Dracula Prince of Darkness,This 2 disc set of Dracula Prince of Darkness was of excellent guality. It was shiped in a short amount of time after ordering it.
4,A Note about the DVD,"This is a very good film from Hammer. My issue is with the print they used for the anchor bay DVD release. The color is off. When they have shown this film on Turner Classic Movies, they show a different print. The color is deeper and richer. If you check the end of the film, the print used on cable was originally distributed by Warner-Pathe. The print on the DVD was originally a 20th Century Fox Distribution.Anchor Bay(or SOMEONE) should release the Warner-Pathe version on DVD. It is a big improvement visually."
4,One of Hammers best,This is one of Hammers best movies. The transfer is just okay. I prefer the region 2 version wich is anamorphic and is sold by Amazon UK.
4,Dracula: Prince of Darkness,Another good portrayal of Dracula by Christopher Lee. Lee plays one of the best Draculas. This movie puts a slightly different twist on the Stoker novel. It makes you want more. Lee and Peter Cushing compliment each other greatly whenever they star together in any movies.
3,A slight disapointment but still entertaining,"This one is - from what I've seen - Hammer's worst dracula film. Sure, it's got its moments and Lee is in top form as Dracula. Yet, the chill just isn't there. It's just pure cheese. Yet, it does have its moments. It's not bad, just not great, either."
3,A surprisingly tepid Dracula movie from director Fisher,"With Christopher Lee as Dracula, Terence Fisher as the director, and Andrew Keir as the vampire hunter, you would certainly expect ""Dracula--Prince of Darkness"" to be a much better film. The Count is revived by his slaverying servents and goes after a group of tourists. Arguably the weakest of the Hammer Dracula films. Actually, no, I'm quite comfortable saying this is the worst of the lot. Watch it, but put extra butter on the popcorn to make up for its shortcomings. The sequel to ""Horror of Dracula,"" but order does not really matter with this movies."
1,Dracula: No Prince At All,"This is NOT the terrifying movie I recall seeing 40+ years ago. It is like a very, very old movie. I wanted to scream, only because I was so disappointed."
2,What A Waste of Good Talent,"Dracula Prince of Darkness had to be one of the longest most boring Hammer films I've ever seen. While there are a couple of good scenes over all it was a waste of Christopher Lee's talent. You don't care about the people in this film and you hope that Dracula comes and just kills them quickly to save you the bland acting and horrible plot and the ending..seriously? I mean seriously does anyone own a rifle that helped produce this movie? while the print from Anchor Bay is a very good print, one of the better prints in the Hammer Film Library on dvd it's a shame the movie could live up to the print.If your a Hammer Horror Fan you'll muddle through it because it's part of the Hammer Dracula Series however it doesn't hold a candle to Horror of Dracula or Taste the blood Dracula."
5,Hot Bod Fusion,"I noticed a flatter stomach after two weeks of the exercises. Everything is detailed and easy to follow. I would highly recommend this book. Also, the male model is very easy on the eyes. Ha!"
3,Coffee table material turn collector's item,"If you are looking for examples of typewriter art dating back from the 1890s to the 1970s, this is the book. Sadly it is no longer in print and rather difficult to procure. I was able to borrow this book from a Californian University via the public library's LINK+ exchange program. Interestingly, a book which once cost 10 UK Pounds (GBP) now carries a $115 USD fee if lost!Sadly this book is rather light on content, what with only the first 6 pages as a fast and quick introduction to the world of typewriter art. I personally disagree with the abstract examples illustrating the art during the 1920s-1930s, as there was clearly better work being produced throughout (and before) that period. That aside, there are some wonderful pieces by the contemporaries of the time; Will Hollis and the renowned Dennis W. A. Collins. If you can manage to obtain a copy, this book is a great addition for anyone who is interested in the world of text-based art."
5,A great pair,5 stars because of these great 2 sonatas.I had this on tape once so i had to get it again.But it sounds great.The games are my favorites. here.He plays these perfectly.This is another rare CD.
4,"Great Product, Poor Packaging","The popcorn machine works as advertised and makes great popcorn. Pretty easy to clean, feels pretty solid. The packing, however, left something to be desired. The heavier something is, the more likely it is to be damaged when shipped. On the front of the top piece right in the middle there was a pretty big gash/dent/crease. It's going to be rented out and would be too much of a pain to exchange, so at this point I don't really care. Also, the axle for the wheels was a little bent, causing it to wobble back and forth when you roll it.Other than that, its a good quality product."
5,Popcorn Machine,Exceptional value. Easy to set up. Great popcorn. Hopper removes easily for cleaning. I highly recommend this machine to anyone interested in theater quality popcorn.
5,A great machine that makes good popcorn,I have used this a couple of times now and it works well. I have read lots of reviews and how to's and at the end of the day it comes down to practice and experimentation. I was very impressed with how fast it popped. There is a bit of clean up but not as bad as I had imagined. Looks good and went together easily. All in all a great product.
5,GREAT,Son and daughter-in-law absolutely love it....makes really good popcorn. They are really enjoying the ease of use and they can enjoy popcorn any time!!
5,The Best,"We are so delighted with this popcorn machine, it was worth every penny.It makes a lot of popcorn and the popcorn tastes great,the price is reasonable and it looks fantastic."
3,You get what you pay for... This popper is light weight.,- the design looks very authentic.- makes an adequate quantity of popcorn.- measuring cups should be labeled for their size.- scoop is awkward to use - there is a tight squeeze to get the popcorn out and put it into bags.- the scoop handle becomes loose and turns making it hard to use.
5,Great addition to our family rec room!,"We have been extremely pleased with this popcorn maker, as well as all of Great Norther's popcorn supplies and their excellent customer service. The popcorn maker looks fantastic in our basement rec room, and our kids love Friday night movie nights!"
3,So Very Cute,This Winnie movie was spell binding for my great-grandson. He was glued to the tv and wanted to see it over and over.
5,great source of inspiration,if you look for great work of an incredibly gifted very inovative and creative bass player that takes you on a mind cruise and leaves you with inspiration get this cd.if you look for something more conventional -get something else-thomas
4,Good album,"Good songs overall. Not as great as Thonk, but still a very solid album with lots of Manring's amazing bass playing..."
1,Threaded top strips and breaks - soft metal - avoid it!,"This is a very nice looking, very nicely weighted item. The design is an A+. But the materials make it an F. The problem is that the pear-shaped bulb on the top, and the tube that the bulb screws into, are made of a very soft metal. The threads (both the male and female threads) rapidly strip out, leaving the bulb loose in its socket. This is quite bad because the bulb is heavy - about half a pound - and will crack your countertop, hurt your foot, or put a big dent in your oak floor (this last, in my case) when it wobbles off. You can try to postpone this problem by wrapping the threads in tape but the softness of the metal makes failure inevitable. It's a discard. Umbra, if you improve the metal, you could solve the problem."
1,Horrible,I agree with the previous reviewer about screwing/unscrewing the top-- extremely annoying and rusts easily if water seeps in (which is easy to do considering you're usually grabbing for a paper towel while your hands are wet). Mine just went in the trash since the bottom had entirely rusted. Time to find a better quality paper towel holder.
3,a so so look at Sinatra,"This was a very informative look at the life and times of Frank Sinatra. The movie Suddenly was also a bonus. The down side was that many of the film clips that they used were just not DVD quality (sound or picture). On the DVD Anchors Aweigh they had the theatical previews for some of Frank Sinatra's other movies and the quality was excellent! Many of these same previews were used on this DVD but the quality just wasn't there. Still for the money, a die hard Frank fan like me, will go home happy!!"
3,NB,"This book is in the public domain, downloadable in PDF format from google.You can browse the book at google and decide if you want a paperback copy"
5,Wilton 10x3-inch pan,Great product for a great price. Very sturdily constructed pan with perfectly straight sides for professional looking cakes. Bakes evenly.
4,Finally Something Different Than Usual,"I came across this CD from a friend who recommened it. All I can say is I am very happy I got a hold of this one. The music that this band plays has its own unique style. The lead singer has an excellent voice, unique to this genre of music. If I had to compare this music to another group I would have to say it reminds me of a combination of Radiohead and Beck. This is a loose comparison at best, so all I can say is get the CD and judge for yourself. I guarentee you will not be disspointed."
2,"Designing bridal Veils, Headpieces, and Hats","Designing Bridal Veils, Headpieces, and HatsThis book does exactly what the title states ""Designing Bridal Veils."" The reason that the book received two stars was because of the homemade quality of the pages. While the information is useful, the offset quality of the entire book is frustrating. This is definitely not for a novice, recommendClassic Millinery Techniques: A Complete Guide to Making & Designing Today's HatsThe author must upgrade with publishing, high glossy photographs and current millinery techniques. What the author does excellent was add samples of the types of material needed to create a hat. Someone who is not familiar with these fabrics would find this information useful. Despite the two stars for the poor production quality, milliners should give this book a look over. However, if you are in a rush to get married, try something else!"
4,first time user,"This was my first time using decorating tips. So, decorating an enchanted cake took me an ""easy"" 9 hours including baking it. My only complaint with the master tip set was that it didn't specify which tip numbers were included. I had to improvise with other tips because the ones I needed weren't included. Obviously I am a novice at this. I thaught that if I got the largest set, I would get them all! It was a lot of fun & a little frustrating. In the end, the cake got great reviews. My biggest mistake was using canned frosting. It was too soft & wouldn't keep it's form. I'm thinking that my shortcut using canned frosting is why it took me so long to decorate. I will enjoy trying other projects with these tips."
4,"Wonderful set, except...","This set is full of many wonderful tips, but there are a few problems. The Nails (as many reviews have already stated) do not stay in place when In try to close the case (so I decided to store them inWilton Ultimate Tool Caddy). The other problem is that the set comes with large tips, but no large couplers. That's just silly!Also, the description says the set includes an angled coupler - it doesn't, so the description should be changed. Overall a good product, but it does have it's flaws."
2,Does NOT have ANGLED COUPLER,"I bought this set because it said it had a standard coupler and an angled coupler. The tips would be mostly duplicates. I REALLY wanted the angled coupler. I am very disappointed that it said it would have it, and it wasn't there. I have spent a LOT of money on Wilton products and will continue to do so. I suggest that the description be changed ASAP!!!!"
5,WHAT A BARGAIN ! PERFECT SET !,I bought this set because of the wonderful selection of tips at such a great price! I found all of the tips that I needed and ended up using even some that I didn't realize were included which helped me to learn new ways of decorating. It's really a wonderful set and for the price you cannot beat it! Why go out and pay $5 or more for each tip when you can get everything you will ever need here! Best bargain on Amazon!
2,Missing Pieces,"Just got my set today, and haven't used them yet. However, when I opened it, I realized I am missing the flower nails and also my couplers are both straight--one of them I believe is supposed to be angled. I am disappointed so far, and need to figure out how to get the missing pieces or get a refund."
5,Very Satisfied,So satisfied with this seller! It arrived well packed and fast enough for me to give to my daughter before she left town to go home. She was so excited to get this and can't wait to try it out. Thanx loads for a great transaction! Set is real nice and durable. My daughter is very happy as well.
1,The Absolute Worst,"I love Friends. I really do. But whenever I happen across Season 7 being rerun on TV, I shudder. This was the worst, most disappointing season ever. Monica became the shrill, silly and nagging wife-to-be of Chandler, whose face, in this season, looks strangely mechanical. Compare Chandler in # 7 to the character in past seasons: where is the sarcasm, the quick wit, the all-around humor? Is it any wonder that this season was the lowest rated one on TV out of all ten? The plots were boring, the actors seemingly uninterested.Don't throw away your money."
4,Gilmore Girls - Seasons 1-5,"Excellent family entertainment. When I sit down to watch an episode, I don't want to stop - - just want to watch one after another."
5,Great and Funny Season! First time its great!,"I love friend, infact im watching the seventh season now! as i write this review!!!! But there are some things, which im finding a bit annoying, so if you don't like friends i suggest starting with a different season, but this is great fun! Friends hasn't lost it's touch still amazingly funny in it's 7th year!"
5,THE OLDER THEY GET THE BETTER THE SHOW!,THIS SEASON IS ONE OF THE BEST YET. IT SEEMS LIKE AS THEY GROW OLDER THE SHOW GETS BETTER. I OWN SEASONS 1-7 AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL ALL THE OTHER SEASONS COME OUT ON DVD!
2,Please don't waste your money!,"It's still friends so its still good, but please don't waste your money on this season guys. I have seen every season of Friends and own most of them except for Season 4 and this is the worst! If your looking for a good season of Friends, I suggest 2,5, or 6."
3,Small Defect,"On one of the discs - the episode with the amardillo, and also the one before that one, had errors in the DVD. They would freeze up and you would hve to FF the DVD to the next episode. Otherwise, no problems."
3,Friends Season 7 Disc 4 has Season 6 Disc 4 Episodes on it!,"Shortly after receiving the Friends Season 7 DVD Set, I watched it. When I popped in Disc 4 (which has 'Season 7 Disc 4' right on the disc), I was very surprised to see that the Episode Menu for this disc actually said 'Friends Season 6' and did indeed have the Season 6 Disc 4 episodes on it. How did the manufacturer manage that? So, I do not have the last 5 episodes for Friends Season 7. How am I supposed to get these, you ask? I have just ordered a used Friends Season 7 DVD Set, at more expense, in the hopes that it actually has the correct episodes on Disc 4. Here's hoping!UPDATE: The used Friends Season 7 DVD Set I received has the correct episodes on Disc 4."
4,"Good DVDs, but disappointed by the box","I like Friends and I bought all ten seasons on Amazon. The DVDs in general are all good. The box is what disappoints me. Several seasons, including the seventh season, are in a new box instead of the paper box I expected."
5,Now this season stole the thunder of Fraiser!,"What can I say about season seven of Friends? It was better than the entire series-run of Fraiser! There was actually a glimmer of hope that Ross and Rachel might get back together but they turned it into a 'false-alarm' One of my most fav episodes will have to be TOW They All Turn 30. It showed a little more mature them (except for Joey. Childish as usual) and flashbacks of Monica, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and Ross' birthdays. Although my most favorite 'SCENE' would have to be from TOW Joey's New Brain where Ross plays his bagpipe to Monica, Chandler, Rachel and Phoebe. It was the funniest, and you could see Jen cracking up while Phoebe sang (or more 'screeched' along) with the bagpipe. And I always like wedding days in sitcoms, because there'll always be problems involved. If you want to laugh your head off, then you just have to buy this season of Friends.A reviewer with the heart to know-Penny (May even become a future critic!)"
5,The 7th wonder of the friends collection,I've been watching friends for about 3 or 4 years no w and i've seen EVERY episode ever made. I have to say it's one of the greatest shows ever made. The seventh season is one of my favorites because in the end of the seventh season Monica and Chandler get married! The seventh season is based around the plans of Monica and Chandler's wedding. I love this season and i love the rest of them to. I will be very sad when this show airs it's final episode but I will always have the dvd's. Heres to friends and it's final episodes. Times may change but I will always love friends.
1,Stay away from Amazon UnBox on Windows 7,"Amazon UnBox process and player is most pathetic and cumbersome to use. It takes forever to get your paid selections into the program's queue, and then downloaded. Many times your selections will not download! Amazon needs to pay some important attention to detail with this UnBox player. It does not function well on Dell with Windows 7 operating system."
3,Not my favorite season,"Everyone, this is not the best season of Friends. Yes, we are all excited to see Monica and Chandler finally get married. But the events leading up to it are not the funniest. My personal favorites are : ""The One with Monica's Thunder""; ""The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding""; ""The One with the truth about London""; and ""The One with Chandler's Dad"". But if you are a fanatic like me, the best season is 4 and 5. Can't wait for Season 8!"
4,"My least favorite season, although still a 4/5","I believe that this is the season where the writers began to run out of ideas, because some of the episodes were somewhat dull. I did not care for ""The One With The Nap Partners"" or ""The One With The Engagement Picture"", although they did have some funny moments. The idea of Ross and Joey liking to take naps together is more sick than it is funny. The season did have some good episodes, such as the one where Joey discovers Rachel's book and when Monica meets Chandler's dad. Of course, the wedding episode was one of the best. This is still a good season, so I would recommend it, but I definitely would not start out with this season"
2,The worst season until then...,"Fans tend to be totally biased towards their favorite shows. FRIENDS is not differente. To rate this season five stars is a real absurd! This is where something ""cracked"": the histories are simply not so good, the plot are sometimes indeed BAD. I don't know what happened, but something happened (including David Schwimmer directing a lot of episodes.. ..like if he was giving some emergency help).This is really the worst sason of the first seven seasons. Only a blind man would not see it!"
1,Overhyped,"Without a doubt the most overrated, piece of garbage series ever. Whiney, insecure wanna be ""yuppies"" living in New York. Enough said. Save your money."
1,Crappy Show,This show so lame it's not funny don't believe the hype about the finale it was so the dumb ross and rachel like come on ppl knew that was going to happen. this show is more like seeing everyone hooking up together then comedy and they have lame jokes not funny the best sitcom ever is EVERYBODY LOVE RAYMOND dysfunctional RULEZ
2,Lame.,"There's nothing horrible about this collection. Then again, there's nothing good about it either. It's simply third-rate pablum masquerading as comedy. The characters are cloying, empty, and hardly funny. The writing is predictable. The stories are dumb. It says a lot about our culture that people actually watch this show in any numbers. I suppose they are attracted to it because the obvious laugh-track allows them to identify the ""jokes"" more readily.Do yourself a favor. Avoid this junk like you would avoid rancid eggs. It just ain't good for ya."
3,Not very creative or attractive to students.,"Although the guiding principle behind this workbook sounds attractive, I would not recommend it. Each exercise is so arid and technically described to the point of confusing me... and I teach the subject! And the whole book is basically variations of the same exercise. I can see using a few of the worksheets, but think my students would declare mutiny if I used more than a few.I am sure there are better books out there. In fact, check out Nancy Dean's ""Voice Lessons."" It takes a completely different approach, but will likley instill some of the same attention to detail that this workbook hopes to teach."
1,Poor video quality,The 1 star is for the extremely poor video quality. The movie is an eternal 5 stars and a must-own for Shammi fans. Mr. Nazir Hussain's successors should re-issue a top quality Blu-Ray.
3,Alright DVD,I enjoyed watching this a kid growing up and decided to get it for my son. I was surprised by the lack of a decent picture. It's very fuzzy and of a really poor quality. Although I think they are a great series I probably will be unlikely to purchase any more unless the quality of the picture is improved.
2,Another Average Drum and Bass CD,"Like many CD's in the Drum and Bass genre, Balance of the Force offers nothing new. The songs not only sound like each other, they sound like a lot of D&B records. I get bored midway through the third song every time, if not earlier."
1,dont receive my order,Order shipped by august 9 but I dont receive that order please check my order or return my money back
4,Good But,"Its not in english, when i read all the reviews i said sounds good, im always looking for a new kickboxing tape, but no one said it was in spanish, well this was a challange for me, but after a few times watching it i got it down, but overall its a good workout,GTS-New Jersey"
5,"Muy, muy bueno","Despues de escuchar Mr. Bungle compre este disco, Zorn esta realmente loco, si quieres oir una nueva alternativa en Jazz lo recomiendo a ojos cerrados, hay temas clasicos en los que el disco entrega una nueva alternativa, mucho mas excitante. Para entrar en el mundo de John Zorn es la mejor alternativa, ya que trae temas de otros discos, excelente."
4,excellent,"Naked City, the term, is a 1950s one: it was a cop show. When you see the two words, you think of smokestacks, fedoras, chain smoking detectives, shadows on walls. Back when the city was about the diner, not the Starbucks.John Zorn's 1980s album does not invoke that that, nor is it a parody of 1950s urban or crime jazz.Zorn's Naked City uses 1980s loft jazz elements, metallic textures, to create a modern abstraction of the old cliche. There is not a vibraphone a mile from Naked City. The trenchcoat is no where to be found.But Zorn works a tongue in cheek suite around the idea of dark ally life. ""Bloodduster,"" for example, is so self-consciencely over-the-top, you can't help laugh and admire how broadly Zorn is drawing the skyline.There are other places to go for true retro music--mainly to the 1950s scores themselves. But for great loft jazz with post-modern kicks, you can't get much better than this."
4,When punk funked jazz,"Rightfully praised as one of spazz-core's top albums, this heavyweight multi-genre freakout can often become pigeonholed and stereotyped as sheer anti-musical id-droppings over skewered patterns, but that summation would belie a fascinating compositional eclecticism residing just underneath all the scattershot menace."
5,Dear God!,"This album is one of the Holy Grails of modern music. In this album, Zorn destroys the walls separating genre with a giant saxophone sledgehammer, with his cohorts, Horowitz, Frith, Frisell, Baron, and Japanoize pioneer Yamatsuka Eye, gleefully helping him. If you truly want to have your musical ideals challenged and your ear expanded, I wholeheartedly recommend this album. It takes you farther than you thought possible."
4,The name's Zorn...John Zorn.,"Anyone heard ""Frankie Teardrop"" by Suicide? John Zorn IS Frankie Teardrop...he IS the bloodcurdling scream that follows the gun shot. He IS the bullet in your stomach. He IS the man you saw on television that drowned his baby in Lake Michigan. He is the cancerous growth that killed your uncle. John Zorn invented your nightmares (with a saxophone, mind you), and he is still somehow listenable and cool. Hip doesn't even begin to describe the cat that could even make James Chance blush. His version of ""Tv Eye"" made even the creator of the song, the Iggster himself, drop his jaw. What a talent, what a performer.Don't tell your friends about this...their lives are peaceful and secure...don't mess that up for them. Keep this one for yourself."
3,my arm hurts,"i really coulda done without the film music. though i love our zorn more than i love my mother, some of the covers (and even a few originals, sadly) are just a skosh cheesy. on the other hand, I'm a vegan. how would i know?"
2,Barely listenable novelty,I like Zorn. His Spy vs. Spy record is excellent as well as Spillane.This one has a few but it's mostly just noisy as hell. A novelty.I didn't like this record when I got it back in the early 90's. I think I sold it or something.
5,A Brilliant New Perspective on the World,"Symbols increasingly shape our lives but few understand their influence over us. This book offers a brilliant and fascinating primer on contemporary symbols. The author - a leading authority on symbols and creator of the Internet's most popular site for symbolism - takes symbols out of reference books, religions, psychoanalysis, literature and art and places them in the center of popular culture and the global battles being fought today. America is placed at the center of global symbol creation with Hollywood and Madison Avenue (entertainment and advertising) as the great creators of global symbolism, New York media as the communicator of symbols and Washington DC as the great manager of symbols. All of this is explored in the light of 9/11. A brilliant and essential new perspective on the world."
2,OK,"This DVD has some nice looking female models and very nice Impoted cars. There is no Nudity,the models are only in Bikini's and there is not much action to see. It is like going to a local car show down town.What you see is what you get.Don't waist your money on this DVD.I'am not impressed with it and feel that they could have done a better job at making it!"
3,From Back Cover,"He's dark and he's dangerous. But reporter Gemma Duncan wants to break the story of businessman Damien Theroux's rumored underground dealings - which means she'll have to deal with the devil himself.Posing as a waitress, Gemma scores a job at one of Theroux's legit restaurants so she can snoop for info. When the bad boy of New Orleans takes an immediate interest in his new employee, Gemma finds herself falling under his seductive spell.Soon Gemma is lost in a shadowy world of naughty sex games, acting out her wildest fantasies with this dangerous man. Part of her knows she has to get her story and get out of there ASAP. But another part wants to see just how far these games will go..."
1,MORE CULT GARBAGE,"When I see that a film has been labeled ""cult,"" I know that two things about it are probably true. One - it's either a horror or a science fiction film. And two - it's so badly made it's almost unwatchable. That's certainly the case with MEAT MARKET. To rate this higher than one star means that you either have a personal connection with the film, or that you are retarded. Or both."
1,o...m...g...,"My friend brought this movie over and by the end of the night I was considering never letting him come over ever again. This was probably the worst thing I've ever been forced to see. I want that time of my life back!The acting was the worst thing ever, even for a low-budget movie. The whole movie was shot with a camcorder that probably just barely survived the 90's. The plot makes just enough sense that you think you get it, but then you realize how horribly wrong you are when from no where a wrestler and vampires show up.I never, ever, ever want to be subjected to something so terrible ever again in my life. I wish I could give it negative stars and then bury every copy of this ""movie""."
3,well.....,"Its not the best movie I've seen and the acting is rather sh@tty but I do respect it. Being his first film and on a very low budget he did good, I have a feeling Brian Clement will be directing some really good stuff further down the road."
4,Well Made! Skimpy Budget - But Entertaining!,"I had no idea MEAT MARKET was such a low budget movie. I did not know that it was shot on video for about six bucks. But when I started watching it, I realized that despite it's low-budget roughness, this movie is actually good!The acting hovers around average; sometimes pretty good, sometimes pretty weak. The image quality is sometimes poor. And the pacing leaves a bit to be desired. BUT - there is so much good stuff here, the bad stuff seems not so bad.MEAT MARKET is a great story. I've never seen a movie successfully combine zombies, vampires, sleazy exploitation, science fiction, and Mexican wrestling! I loved it! The movie is often spooky, often gory, and never boring. If you're one of those mainstream ""horror movie"" fans who only sees the Hollywood junk, you'll probably hate MEAT MARKET. But if you're a REAL horror fan, you'll put up with the low budget to be rewarded with a very unique, imaginative, and entertaining zombie movie!"
2,Disappointing Zombie Film,"For zombie film buffs it should be a rule to ignore low budget zombie films over the last few years. Not that large budget films are guarantees of excellence, but they have a much better track record over the last 10 years than their low budget counterparts in the zombie genre. Meat Market is one such example of a bad low budget film. It has a promising enough storyline, but the effects are bad as is the acting. It tries to be a quirky Night of the Living Dead but can't pull it off. At the end of the credits, there is an unbelievable threat against anyone who'd dare illegally copy the film. That was about the best laugh I had during the entire movie given that I can't imagine ANYONE wishing to bootleg copy this film."
3,You get What you pay for.,"I purchased the thrower a month ago and have used it twice. Assembly is easy and overall construction seems sturdy. My complaints are 1.) The release mechanism is sticky and gets jammed sometimes. 2.) You need a wrench to adjust the thrower up and down, and side to side which makes adjusting on the go a chore. Other than that, a decent thrower for the money I guess."
3,breaks a lot of clays,"I've looked for a way to contact the seller, but haven't found it on the site. The thrower was easy to put together and seems sturdy enough, but it breaks a lot of clays. I don't know if there's something wrong with it or something I'm doing wrong."
2,"Would work well, but doesn't work with Windows ME!!!","This product looks great for laptops like mine that only have USB ports, but it does not work with Windows ME!!! The drivers for the serial and parallel ports do not load.Only get this product if you have Windows 98/95 with USB."
1,Doesn't work with Win98 either,"A follow on from SkiBilly. I'm running Win98 and after a long drawn out process to install the drivers (drivers included with the unit didn't work so had to go to the ADS web site and download the updated ones) discovered that the device ""grabs"" my computer and won't allow it to go into standby mode. I contacted ADS customer support and they recommended that I simply not use standby mode!Needless to say, I've returned the thing."
4,No better deal for the money!,The Oscar Schmidt OG1 is my 8 year old son's first guitar. He will take lessons and learn to play on it. It will be great for that purpose. Adding an inexpensive amp (used from a local dealer) will be the quencher and he will enjoy his learning experience.
2,Not good in quantities over one or two,"I shelled out the $6 price for a bag of these at Safeway and they were tasty. So I bought the pack of six from Amazon, but they taste stale and overly dry. Bleh."
5,Great first novel by a witty and insightful author,"This was a very enjoyable story, with interesting characters, continually intriguing plot developments, and an entertaining style. I read it from front to back in a matter of hours, looking forward to what might happen next. I hope to see many more such books from Ms. Coble."
3,Hit or miss quality,"either the way these arrows are manufactured or packaged, they sometimes have warped suction cups. when this happens, they will not stick to anything. i've also had the glue that holds the suction cup to the shaft come of on two occasions... which then turns these into a weapon versus a toy. the 12"" arrows are actually 13"" long. and the replacement 18"" arrows are only 17"". the shorter arrows will be good for a youngster. however, the bow have the ability to be drawn back further, making the longer arrows a better choice for slightly older kids that can pull back a little harder. the bow itself seems very sturdy and flexible."
4,Bathroom Wall Shelf,"Well, considering that I was shipped the wrong item, this piece has worked out OK. The construction is solid, stable, sturdy and attractive. It was not difficult to assemble. I would have returned the item, but the price on this item was terrific...it would have cost more to return it than I paid for the shelf."
4,"Southern Fried Boogie, Blues and Old School","Hank Jr. writes about three things: His daddy, women, or booze. He doesn't disappoint here. The songs are standard three chord rock, but he employes some great musicians to help him out with the twangey, bluesey, twists that make it very listenable. The lyrics are pretty good and sometimes downright funny...don't get me wrong there are no ""Whiskey Bent"", ""Outlaw Women"", ""Dinosaur"", classics, but for his fiftieth something album, it's pretty good. And, he goes back to a hole in the wall juke joint his daddy played at (and escaped from when a drunken jealous husband came looking for his wife) to record the music. So go buy it. It's worth it just for the linear notes."
3,OK,"I don't know, I love Hank, but I just don't think this CD is that great. It has some good songs, and I don't regret having bought it, but it has some pretty bad songs as well. Sorry Hank, just callin' it as I see it."
1,This is a song review - not the entire disc,"The 'F' Word is the dumbest song I have heard in a LONG time. and that is saying a lot, considering how many CD's I listen to. I couldn't believe when I found out that it was recorded by Hank Williams Jr. talk about hitting rock bottom!"
3,3.5 stars REALLY...,"This CD is Good and is definitely worth buying IF you are a Hank Williams Jr. fan. The only thing bad about it is (that it sounds like) he changed his style a little. He just does'nt have ""it"" on this CD. He does'nt have his RAW and strong southern attitude/voice as he usually does. It sounds like he tried to make it sound similar to that new ""pop-country"" stuff also know as ""todays country"" which is too bad sounding. BUT if you are a Hank Jr. Fan its worth buyiny with songs like: Cheatin Hotel, Cross on the Highway, The F-word, and some of the others are decent."
2,"A Demonstration, Nothing More.","Unless you practice the system or forms presented in this video, you will not find it of use. This video contain almost no instruction or useful applications. As a practitioner of Chinese Swordsmanship I purchased it out of curiousity, I wish I had spent my money on something else... The Rock 'n' Roll presentation of the cutting sequenced just gave me a headache."
5,Excellant,Most books I've read on schizophrenia have been written by so-called experts (in other words people in the medical profession) and are usually somewhat lacking when it comes to how the victims of this terrible disease actually feel about what is happening to them. Dealing with the daily and incessant turmoil created within ones life by this disease is something that every professional who works with schizophrenics should understand. This book lends a greater understanding of schizophrenia for both the average person and medical personnel as well.
5,my favorite color,I'm naturally a red-head and I use this color every 3 months to boost my natural color. It is a great shade and always comes out evenly.
1,Does exactly the opposite of it's promise,"If I could give it zero stars I would. It claims to add shine and brighten but not lighten. I got absolutely no shine or brightness, my hair was actually duller after using this product. And it did lighten my hair considerably. I did not want to change my haircolor, yet I had people asking me why I got it lightened/highlighted. So, what I got rather than the promise was dull lackluster bleached hair the texture of straw. I have been growing it out for almost a year to try to get rid of the damage that one of these treatments did. You can pick out the regrowth line from a mile away and it looks insane in a messy pony or bun since the ends are a completely different color and texture than the hair they are laying against. This might be OK if it were the look you were going for, but it wasn't the look I was going for and it wasn't what the product advertised to do. If you value your hair, I would avoid this product."
1,Note: positive reviews are NOT for Shine Happy,"I don't know why reviews for all Natural Instincts products are grouped together, but I wish I'd looked closely enough to see that the reviews for Shine Happy are overwhelmingly negative--separately, Shine Happy would probably get an average 1-1/2 star at best, and for good reason. Who wouldn't like their hair a little shinier, right? So wishful thinking and misplaced trust persuaded me to try this, even as I was thinking, ""It contains peroxide. What does peroxide do? Lighten and damage hair."" Well...yup. My hair was virgin and seldom even blow-dried so in great condition, medium/light brown with natural dark blond highlights. This lightened my hair half a shade (not what I was looking for, but at least it's not orange) but took all the shine away. In fact, because it's significantly duller now, any color lift is offset so my hair doesn't look blonder, just much unhealthier. Great. Fingers crossed that I won't have a root line. What a terrible product."
1,"Disappointed in the ""new and improved"" version","I used Roasted Chestnut color for years. It lasted forever and never dried out my hair. I didn't think there would be a difference in the color or how long it last with the new ""improved"" version. I was very sadly mistaken. First, the new version did not cover up all my gray, and I don't have that much, yet. The old version did. Second, the new version doesn't even last a week. And even when I use the 2 week touch up, it only lasted a few days. I am so disappointed that Clairol changed the chemistry of their Natural Instincts line. It used to be a great product. I can't find a similar hair color like this one. And I have gone to the salon to get my hair colored and I still like the old Roasted Chestnut color the best. I'm sad that I won't be able to use it anymore, VERY SAD. I just loved that color."
1,Why they can say natural?,"It says natural, but it is NOT.After I use this product, I had terrible itch scalp a week. I never had problem any popular bland name hair color.Not recommended."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Relying on a glowing review from a famous talk show star's magazine, I decided to give this a try. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. This product turned my hair into a dry dull orange bush. Not only did it not provide shine, it did the polar opposite. Now I am growing out a rough orange mat of hair that was only made worse by trying to dye it natural black again with another product. I could not comb through my hair. It became fragile, wispy and prone to heavy duty breakage. Shine happy put a layer of dullness over my hair that lead to complete un-manageability. This product should be removed from the market."
1,Don't ruin your hair too!,I have reddish brown hair(colored). My hair had some shine but i would like to have more of course so i picked this off the shelf going WOW this sounds great! WRONG!!!!! I came home all excited(lol) and read the directions as i have never used anything quite like this. Do not use if you have colored in the last 3-4 weeks..well it has been 7 weeks since coloring the last time so i figured i was safe. WRONG AGAIN!!!!!!! I put it on..the smell wasn't too bad and while on it seemed all shiny..i was like yeahhhh. I waited the exact 10 minutes and i washed it out..it automatically felt crunchy. I put the conditioner they give you in and it did help a little. I got out dried it and WHAT A MESS!! My hair is a orangy blob...very lifeless..and even less shiny than before. Now i have to go to a salon to fix the mess. Thanks alot clairol..please pull this item!
4,satisfied,"I thought this product worked pretty well. i have awful hair, its really fried because i have naturally blak hair and i get it bleached to be as white as possible. My hair did feel a little dry after putting the glaze on so i left the conditioner on extra long, mixed it with some watered down gotb crazy sleek (which i also added blue and purple dye to to tone down my yellow)blow dried it and then put on a good deal of argan oil and straightend it. My hair is deffinitly shiner then usual and the glaze lighted up my color a little more which was nice. i might use this product again but i might try a different one too. the results for me are noticable but not drastic. i would recomend this product to someone lik me with dead very light hair."
5,gentle,"you can trust natural instincts for good level 2 color. im trying to grow out my hair after coloring it, and am using this dye to ease my roots in. also, the tube of conditioner that comes with is very nice."
2,Not impressed,"Although I'm not proud, I have been using various hair dyes and box treatments for over 15 years. I was really excited about this product; I just dyed my hair a month ago and it was already looking quite drab. My hair is naturally very dark brown (stylists call it a 4), but at the moment, before the shine treatment, it was medium brown with red and orange tones. After following all instructions on the box, as I always do, I rinsed my hair to find it lighter than before. Not to mention, especially in the sunlight, it appeared almost orange at the top! I was already unhappy with the reddish tones carried in my hair and to accentuate those tones with bright orange only made it worse. I could understand how those with naturally cool hair colors could use this product and essentially benefit, but unfortunately, I feel as if anyone with naturally warm hair might be unhappy with their results."
2,"Hair is Softer, a little shinier and more golden toned.","I figured when I bought this product that it would be just a gloss of some sort, I was wrong. It contains peroxide and I didn't realize this until i had already torn the box open. What the heck lets do this! My hair is actually much softer than usual and there is a little more shine. Although its hard to tell if its really shine or my medium ashy blond hair with now golden highlights. Considering how unpredictable this product is on different hair types I don't recommend it. Hopefully in a few weeks I wont be able to see roots growing out. Buyer beware--get a shine serum instead."
2,why didn't I read these reviews first??,"This was an impulse buy while shopping for hair coloring for my daughter. I thought, what the heck I'll be happy if I can add some extra shine to my otherwise long and attractive hair. Well that didn't really happen. For the first several days I felt like my hair was reflecting sunlight better but after just a few washings I found my hair had less shine than before the Shine Happy treatment. Then I come to find out that people have reported unsatisfactory results for years and Clairol apparently has done nothing to improve this product. Pretty disappointing Clairol."
5,Great if you are blond with highlights!,"I have long fine but thick very straight naturally light brown/dark blonde hair. I originally used this when I didn't have highlights and it made my hair noticably shinier. This did not make my hair feel dry at all and the conditioner smelled absolutely amazing! Nowadays I have light blond highlights throughout my hair and I notice that my regrowth seems very dark. I love using this because it makes my regrowth blend perfectly into my highlights for cheap, while enhancing the shine at the same time. Yes it does lighten it somewhat but it looks good on me. I guess I wouldn't recommend it for someone with dark hair who is looking for shine. For them I would recommend a celephane treatment at a salon. For blondes with regrowth though, it is awesome!"
4,"Not what I expected, but I like it!","The color did NOT turn out in my hair like it did on the box. Of course, no dye from the box ever does. It is darker and MUCH redder. Bright magenta and orange too! It is not a natural looking color, but I actually really like it! It's different. And since it is semi permanent it did not make my hair one flat color. Some of my natural hair shows through, which adds greater tone to the color. If you want the color on the box, then do not get this product. But if you want something new and fun, this is a great color!"
1,Didn't do anything,"This product is definitely not worth the money or effort to try. My hair is already red and it didn't change my hair's color unlike other reviewers, but it didn't really do anything. My hair is no shinier as the package promised. It didn't do any visible damage to my hair, but I'd rather have spent the money on a better product. Try something different if you want smoother and shinier hair - this one's a dud."
1,"You can do better, Clairol","I LOVE Clairol Natural Instincts so naturally I was excited to see this product on the market promising to take the dull out of my hair the 40's have seem to bring. While I don't have a horror story about a color change, I am disappointed it did absolutely nothing. I had my hair highlighted a month ago and wanted to give it a little boost. When I use Natural Instincts to color my hair it does a great job and gives me GREAT shine so I expected the same from this product, just without the color but I got nothing."
1,this product is crap,"I have dark brown dyed hair, (naturally light brown) and it's very fine and dull. So i thought this product would make it shinier and healthier looking. WRONG!! it turned my hair dirty blonde on certain patches! Now my hair is all uneven colored! also, i think it made my hair even more dull! I AM SO MAD"
2,Nothing great,"I have average-shiny hair, so I got this hoping it would add some pop. It definitely lightened my hair a little like others said, but I acutally like the lightening...it blends my grown out blonde with my natural ash brown well. As for what it is intended for...shine...it did not do much. My hair looks the same shinyness. I would not buy this again, but it didn't ruin my hair as others said."
5,Happy to find on line.,"I have been having trouble finding this color in stores, was very happy to know I can order online. It came in a timely matter and everything was as expected."
3,Natural Instincts Hair Color,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with Clairol hair color -- however, I ordered the color Rosewood. I've used it before and really like the shade. What I got was Dark Auburn Brown -- which is something totally different. It's also a good color -- so I kept it -- but was disappointed that the wrong thing was sent to me."
4,Happy with Shine Happy,"I just tried this product for the first time and am very pleased with the results. I have naturally dark blonde straight fine hair and have been getting it highlighted professionally for years at $90 a pop. I don't have gray hair and love my natural color, I mainly just get it done because I just like how it feels right after lightening it, like it has a little extra body and softness, so I thought I would give shine happy a try. The results for me were exactly as advertised, although it may have lightened my hair a tiny bit but not enough to be sure. I followed instructions exactly and finished with the conditioner and now my hair is shiny with a little extra body and lift at the roots. It is soft and slinky, just like after going to the salon, at a fraction of the cost. Now I know why my stylist always vehemently warns against using boxed color - because she didn't want to lose the $500 a year I was spending with her!"
3,Red Hair Coloring,I loved the color and it left my hair in about the same condition as other hair dyes. It did wash out really soon after using it and I have this problem with all the hair coloring products I've used in the past. I don't know if it's because of my type of hair or the products are made that way.
1,If I could give it negative stars I would,I curse this product every time I look in the mirror. I loved my natural hair color but thought I would give it a little pampering just for the heck of it. My hair lightened about 2 shades and has a gross orange hue to it and I feel like my hair is weaker now. This was almost a year ago and I'm still trying to grow it out (it's long) and it will take me a long time. I've thought of dying it back to my natural color but I'm scared since all the dyes I see have peroxide (which is what this product has that ruined my hair) so I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just wait until it has all grown out and take hair multi-vitamins in the meantime.
1,Problems,"DISAPPOINTED WITH OPPOSITE RESULTS. DID THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT DISCRIBED & I ALWAYS USE THIS SAME COLOR. INSTEAD OF LESS BRASSY BLOND , I NOW HAVE RED! TRYING FOR REFUND..."
5,GREAT HBO MOVIE,One of the best HBO movies. Great story telling and captures the essence of a man and his era
2,"Ving Rhames is the champ, Don King nothing but chump.","Don King is a self-promoter the likes that few have seen in our lifetime. This film takes a novel approach to telling the King story, blowing KING up into as big a buffoon as possible, and using King himself (actor Ving Rhames) in telling the tale. I give director John Herzfeld credit-it's a novel and appropriate approach to the biography of a man who truly is more caricature than real.Rhames gives an inspired and convincing performance as King, breathing much life into a film from a book that was for all practical purposes stillborn.Enjoy the movie for Rhames and pay little attention to the details."
1,A Very Crap Film,"Oh my God!!! Do not waste your time watching this awful movie with which has an even more awful cast...I think that one star is really pushing it as the film was so bad that I switched it off less than half way through. I am a great boxing fan and would normally love to watch any movie, BUT, I draw the line when the movie is so bad that you actually wish that you hadn't wasted your time watching it and would rather go to the denstist and have all your teeth removed with the use of acid (and that is without painkillers)... An awful movie that is not even worth a star - I just wish that it could be given a minus number it is honestly that bad!!!"
4,Thank You HBO,"Anyone who says they respect Don King's accomplishments after seeing this film and learning of what he has done to the sport of boxing and its inhabitants, need to be taken out back...There is no praise-worthy form of corruption, I am sorry. You may feel a little sympathy for a pathetic character like that, but that person is not worthy of respect. Is it now tolerable to lie, cheat, rob and steal from another person? Is it okay to ruin the lives and careers of others for selfish purposes? All because someone is charismatic and personable? What is it all coming to? Pros: Ving did an awesome job of portraying DK. Honestly tries to portray King in his accurate light. Intriguing life, regardless. Good, solid direction. Great Ali impersonation. Good cinematography.Cons: A bit rushed, loosely focused at times.Rent it."
2,Looks nothing like the picture.,The picture does not resemble the hat at all. It doesn't even have a puffball at the end. The cotton is cheap but it still works with simple outfits and is fashionable. It just looks nothing like the picture.
5,Another great sequal!,"Is there a sport this dog can`t do?I don`t think there is!This 2nd sequal to AIR BUD is very entertaining and funny,and I reccomend it for anyone who likes SOCKER DOG,AIR BUD,AIR BUD:GOLDEN RECIVER,or any movie that has sports or cool dogs in it!Josh and Buddy are back for another great adventure and in this one,Josh meets a beautiful Socker Coach,who he immediatly gets a crush on,and Buddy starts to like the girl Josh likes dog!Buddy and the girls dog have 6 puppies(not 4,like it shows on the cover),and they are absolutly adorable!!!Oh,I forgot to tell you,the beggining starts out at Josh`s mom and her boyfriends wedding!I`m so happy Josh has a new dad and his mom has a new husband!I won`t tell you anymore cause` I don`t want to spoil anything!Just one more thing....see this movie!!!!You`ll love it!"
4,"Good Movie, Okay DVD","This Air Bud movie is pretty good. It has new characters and new storylines. The dogs and puppys are great and it has the usual bad guys. This time it is about soccer. Overall great movie and okay DVD. It is in fullscreen, that is why I gave it a 4 star rating."
2,Not worth seeing...,"Our family is big ob Disney movies. We really like the Disney Buddies movies too. They are corny of course but cute and entertaining. This one is more about people than animals and is ALL about lovey lovey crap between young kids. My kid is 5 so I would not recommend for young kids. Maybe 10 yrs old and up. For us, and my child's age, the buddies are a better fit. It is a bit boring I thought as well. IT did not even hold my attention."
5,it had to be said,"Reviewer: A reader from United KingdomWish I'd had this a few years back. Press officers need to be as cynical as the journalists they work with, and working in this role with blue-chip companies there's plenty to be cynical about. I witnessed first hand some of the tactics in Mr Craig's book, particularly the management fads, first hand. I watched as companies' people were faced with, and confused and demotivated by, complete tosh whilst customers were left floundering. I hid, literally, from consultants who said that a company's PR people were its 'most important' and that they would be 'spending lots of time with me' (they say that to all the girls). I was angered most by the management that soaked up this rubbish (the MBAs being the biggest culprits, a subject also covered in 'Rip-off') and accused freethinkers of being negative whilst we tried to keep their businesses going. Where were you when we needed you most Mr Craig?"
4,Sadly True,"This is one of the most interesting ""inside story"" published in a book about the so called Management Consulting / Business Consulting firms. It is an eye opener for the clients who hire such firms/individuals to scrutinise those firms/individuals and make sure they are getting what they are paying for and not just pre-written texts that are now available to anyone with an internet connection and a credit card."
2,A bit of bile,"The book is a thin account of the author's experiences as a big 5 consultant, and takes place before the implosion and restructuring of the overall consulting market.The resulting conclusions are largely inuendo as the facts are not fully attributed. It has a tell all style, but without the tell all facts. For such a accusatory set-up, the finish is weak. As a buyer, I felt ripped off."
1,Don't Expect Much...,"Being an executive at a large company, I've had a great deal of experience with management consultants- some good, some bad, most somewhere in between. As such, I was intrigued by the title and description of this book so I ordered it.I have to say I was very disappointed right from page 1. This book is written in a very amateurish way. It is poorly edited (if it was actually edited at all), and now that I have it in my hands, it is clearly a self-published book. It is so badly written that I have put it down after making it through only the first couple of pages and doubt that I will ever open it again.Despite the interesting premise, I would strongly suggest that you pass on this book."
3,Wilton Decorative Preferred 12 by 3-Inch Round PanWilton,"The round pan made by aluminum so it very light weight, and the pan I received was dent in the bottom, so I don't like it."
5,The Greatest Series of Books,"The popular Booby Pendragon is a normal kid until he his peculiar Uncle Press showed him a ""flume"" a portal that allows ""travelers"" to travel to different dimensions.Of course there is no story without an evil villian, and that's where Saint Dane comes in. As you probably can guess Saint Dane wants to control all of ""halla"" which is everything that ever is, was, or will be.The traveler's mission is to defeat Saint Dane, and all travelers have special powers. Travelers can only die when it was meant to be. Travelers heal extremely quickly. Every language spoken sounds like a traveler's costumary language. Saint Dane can transform into any creature he wishes.This is the greatest series of books. It is well writen, very detailed, and most of all a great series of stories. Anyone who reads these books will become fans quickly, as the magic that D.J. Machale has written pull you into Pendragon(I pressed ""chilkdren's review"" by accident)"
1,Poor Quality,"The quality is not consistant with all the other items I have ordered from Amazon. The pages of the book fall apart easily. Also, the recemmended age group is 9-12 and the book uses profanity. It is not necessary to use such profanity or any profanity for this age group. I have returned the item and will be more cautious in the future."
3,"Average, but read it if you like.","The books come in a box and each book is around one inch thick. I don't know if it was by accident or not, but I have found some typos in the books (such as missing quotation marks, etc.).The books are okay, in my opinion. The first two books were around 3-4 stars (meaning a B- to a B+ rating). The third book just killed me. I thought the characters were just 'dumb', because they didn't really have to think about what the villan was thinking about (i.e. the villan's scheme was so easy to see, even if I were a character in the story). The third book killed my interest, but read it if you like and see if the villan's plot was as easily distinguished for you as it did me.Overall, I think the books are just average. Being gr.8 when I read this, I think the main character's mind (he was around gr.8ish in the beginning) was not very mature. The reading level was easy too."
5,Central Mass CPA review,"Advantage ""IP"" is a must read for any business owner. Jean Sifleet does a phenominal job defining intellectual property and describing how to protect it. She also delves into other business issues like employee noncompete agreements. All this is done in an environment that is easy to read for anyone. The examples she cites are excellent. We will be recommending this to our clients."
5,Yum,I tried to just write yum like 20 times but it wouldn't let me. But I tried because this stuff is so good.
5,yummy filling hot cereal,"Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran cereal is super great for cold winter mornings when you need something substantial and warming. It also contains a lot of fiber which makes it low-calorie and extremely filling, while giving your insides a good scrubbing! I bought this primarily because I watch calories and according to the package there are 80 calories per 1/3 cup serving!"
5,Best stuff for Dukan dieters,"I have recently lost over 60 pounds following theThe Dukan Diet: 2 Steps to Lose the Weight, 2 Steps to Keep It Off Forever. A component of that diet is daily oat bran.We've tried a couple of different brands, but we like Bob's Red Mill the best. Both the flavor and texture are superior, and I like that it's organic. I also like the company - having seen them profiled in the news. They treat their employees well and even basically gave partial ownership to their workers.For use with the Dukan diet, I find the easiest and tastiest way to prepare is to put two tablespoons in a bowl, pour in just enough skim milk to cover, then microwave for about 60 seconds. I add in organic cinnamon (cinnamon is good for blood sugar)."
5,Awesome,"Made according to directions, this oatmeal is thick and very nice. Put in some real maple syrup and you are good to go."
5,Oat Bran,"This is a delicious product that I would never have known about until I needed it for a special diet. As a hot breakfast cereal, it is smooth and creamy and takes very little time to make. It is filling and last a long time."
5,"Rich, mellow flavor; not clumpy; lots of fiber; no gas","Bob's Red Mill Organic Oat Bran Cereal can be described in both flavor and texture as somewhat akin to cream of wheat. It is also darker than and tastes richer than Quaker Oat Bran Cereal which, I believe, contains some of the whole oat making it pastier and clumpier. Quaker's oat bran cereal cooks very much the same way that steel cut oats cook which have been ground in a coffee grinder; i.e. very clumpy. Bob's Red Mill Oat Bran cereal clumps a lot less and does not taste pasty. It is a very good cereal and very high in fiber. Furthermore, I eat it twice per day without any unwanted digestive fireworks, whereas the equivalent of oatmeal or steel cut oats would, to say the least, overwhelm. I highly recommend this cereal."
3,"It's ok, not that great",I heard the other having nuts is better than this. I have order the other now.It's ok but not that great.
1,I typed in gluten free...,I'm sure this product is wonderful except I typed in gluten free and when this came up I ordered it. And of course it isn't returnable... I realize this is at least half my fault. But Amazon can you please fix this!
5,I want (and get) the benefits. . .,"I don't use this as cereal, although there's no reason not to, if you're a fan of hot cereal for breakfast. And you could bake up a storm with it, but I'm not a baker. Rather, it's the base for my pancake batter, an addition to my omelettes, a thickener in soy milkshakes,and a hundred other uses. But most of all, I always pour a hefty slug of it into my morning coffee, because I want (and get) the benefits of starting the day with all that healthy, tasty, natural fiber."
5,Delicious,"This is truly delicious; and it's quick and easy to prepare. I make it with water, almond milk, sugar, salt, cinnamon and vanilla. Then I top it with strawberries, raisins or slices of banana.Years ago I used to order an oat cereal from a gourmet shop that tasted very similar to this. I had tried to duplicate it but nothing came close until I found this oat bran. I love the smooth texture. It tastes like oatmeal and a bran muffin rolled into one."
4,Excellent Product,"Watching cholesterol by doctors orders led me to the importance of oat bran. Oatmeal as I knew it is nothing like the quality of the real thing found in this product. I use it in muffins, eat it as cereal and in cookies. Very pleased. I just wish it was not individual packages as I would have preferred a bulk box.."
3,Particularly valuable for the Crumb work,"George Crumb's harrowing ""Black Angels"" is given a compelling performance, and this, particularly for a Crumb fan like me, would alone justify this CD. I also liked the Tallis transciption, which suits the viol-like sound of Kronos well. However, the Shostakovich needs a richer sound in it's slow sections (Kronos is best in the violent 2nd and sarcastic 3rd movements). Marta's work strikes me as more irritating than mournful (perhaps it's my shortcoming, but the interpolated ethnic singing, complete with sobs and sniffles, quickly got on my nerves). As for the Ives, Kronos' arrangement doesn't add much to the original other than an excuse to include it on this recording, which is good enough reason for this delighted listener! I will return to about half of this CD often."
3,Echo added to mono recording,"I deducted two stars because of the reverberation added to the vocals by the sound engineers, a common practice in the early 1960's to give some ambiance and projection. The slight echo, not part of the singer's natural voice, makes the music sound better on AM radio, but is annoying on a good hi-fi system. Don Costa's arrangements are fine with plenty of strings and room for Connie's vocals. Other listeners may overlook the echo, but I cannot.The 12 songs are:(1) MacNamara's band(2) Mother Machree(3) My wild Irish rose(4) Dear old Donegal(5) Did my mother come from Ireland?(6) Danny boy(7) It's a great day for the Irish(8) Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral (That's an Irish lullaby)(9) How can you buy Killarney?(10) How are things in Glocca Morra(11) When Irish eyes are smiling(12) A little bit of heaven"
4,Not as good as I would expect from Fluke,After reading the reviews of all the similar punchdown tools and seeing that all of them had their quirks I bought this one. Seems solidly made and works reasonably well. I've only used it for a couple connections so far. Only problem I've noted is that the cut blade for the 110 tool rarely seems to make a successful cut. I've always looked to Fluke as being the premier manufacturer in their field (and hoped to have some Fluke stuff someday) so I'm kinda disappointed that the tool has this issue. Not a huge deal - with my limited use I can cut off the wires with a small diagonal cutter but it would be a real pain for someone doing production work.
1,not durable,"we were excited to take this on a trip, was easy to pack flat in our luggage. and we were excited when we blew it up for our son to play with, it had a soft bouncy quality. however within literally three minutes of playing with it, the ball hit a tree and got a hole. we're gonna try and patch it when we get home...but just a warning that it may be $ down the drain."
2,Flimsy,"The blade is plenty sharp--I keep slicing my thumbs open. But it's also very flimsy. The tension isn't strong enough to keep the blade flat as you cut through thicker cakes--like the other reviewer said, it rides up as you go along. So, if you don't bake dense cakes, you might be ok. The smaller the cake, the better it works. But what's the point of buying a large leveler if I can only use it on cakes that I could cut with my bread knife anyway?"
1,Ridiculous!,"This leveler is a joke for professionals and novices a like. The blade moves, flips to the side and digs into the cake. I would absolutely recommend NOT buying this product."
2,Don't spend your money!,The blade is too flimsy. Did not cut layers level and was difficult to use. Don't waste your money on this item. You can do a better job with a piece of fishing line or a knife.
2,Cake Leveler,Only used the leveler once or twice. The blade flexes a good amount creating uneven tortes. I found it much easier to use a good quality serrated knife.
5,"great shoes, great bargain","I got very high style, costly name brand shoes at the price of SNEAKERS! I am very pleased with this purchase and would buy again."
3,Not the best edition,"If you buy this book you already know what you need it for and what it is about (just read the title).A must-have for literature students.Nevertheless, this is not the best edition you can find. The translation is not as precise as could be expected, trascriptios from Russian terms are made into the French phonetic system and stay unaltered in this edition.Hope it helps.Cheers"
4,Does The Job!,"I'm a first time computer owner but very particular about electronic ""Gear""(i'm an audiophile).I happen to be very happy with this Hub so far(one month old).It does the job it is intended to,I have a printer,scanner and my keyboard connected to it and it works just fine.Now I have 3 extra usb ports open for business. It is a bit light in weight but then most others are too.I'm an iMac user(running OSX) and if you are too then I would suggest you give this one a try."
2,Poor Performance & Customer Support,"I purchased an Ultra Hub 4 from Circuit City, connected it to my PII and it worked for about 3 min. After the first three minutes the four green ""hub"" lights (indicating the hubs were working) did not remain lit on a continuous basis. I tried unplugging all cables sequentially but the hub never performed to my expectations. I wrote ADS Tech customer support and they never repsonded. I will return the Ultra Hub 4 and exchange for a better brand. I guess you get what you pay for . . ."
5,Slow tempos but gorgeous performances,"I tend to favor slow tempos in romantic music, but Moravec's tempos were slow even by my standards. But the performances are gorgeous, which is what matters most."
2,"Another vote for ""please be quiet""","I will merely steal the description of my fellow reviewer as they were so very accurate...""This recording deserves five stars for the brilliant playing of Moravec. However, the constant moaning,humming,heavy breathing,or whatever it is that Moravec does is very distracting...""Through my system this was actually so distracting that I can not even listen to the album. All I hear is moans, heavy breathing and especially a sound that seems to be pedal movement. On a low end system or in your car it is fine, but on a good system this recording just doesn't hold up."
4,"These are terrific, but.....","Vasary's are better, in virtually every way. The new DGG Triple (with an extraordinary reading of the Ballades, as well as the Scherzos and Waltzes), makes these seem rather mannered. I wouldn't throw these out (nor the Rubinstein!), but there's a new (actually old) king in town."
5,The Best in Children's Music,"As a professional nannie, I have always believed in the value of music. I discovered this album by accident, and it is my favorite. I even listen to it when I'm by myself! I like Bill Harley's understanding of how children think and see the world around them, and above all, his wonderfully wacky sense of humor. He trully appreciates children, and never talks down to them. Thank you, Bill Harley, for wonderful hours of musical entertainment for all ages!"
4,excellent,"Skin Alley were a progressive rock unit who later went funk. That can be heard on the compilationBad Words and Evil People: The Transatlantic Anthology 1972-73.But in 1969--look at the cover, could it be from any other period-they kicked off with this album. This is strictly keyboard prog, but it works. The tracks are well written, basic songs that foray into organ solos and turn corners with interesting interludes. This is not quite the invention within self-contained songs of some early Vertigo Porg like Cressida and Coliseum, but Skin Alley does not over pour with side long essays either.The audio here is pretty muddy, and there is not a lot of clarity or good separation. But if you like music that fits into that '69 wedge right between psych and progressive, the music makes this worth owning."
3,Good Intro Track,"The intro track, ""Living in Sin"", promises a very entertaining album. Hoever, the rest of the CD is a very eclectic mix of styles that does not generate much energy. Maybe progressive, but it does not rock (much)."
4,Marine Exhaust Tube,"There are no direction that come with this device, so you need to find some directions on line. Other than that, it beats the heck out of putting on a regular exhaust bellows!!! The boat will be slightly louder, but only slightly."
4,Design history,"A light but enlightening journey through the evolution of cover designs, as impacted by world events, technology and taste. Particularly interesting for those in the industry."
4,Just noting two little quirks.,"In general I agree with the other reviers so I won't repeat their statements here. I'd just like to note two tiny quirks: The Cover design has the wrong runes (obviously the designers looked up the numbers Tolkien gives in the Appendix of the ""Lord of the Rings"" in the wrong table) and secondly the earth of the world maps is much too small, only half as large as the real earth, which is strange since Tolkien clearly does not describe another planet but an imaginary past of our own planet. So much for Tolkien purism... otherwise it is great."
4,"Close, but no bananas","This atlas really helped me see where I was at as I read the Lord of the Rings. I could see how long it took to get from one place to another and how long they were at a single place without having to look it up again.The reason I only gave it four stars is because it was the work of a fan, and not the actual maps of J.R.R. Tolkien. I was kind of looking for that.Other than that it was great :P"
3,"OK, but not a substitute for other atlases","I got really, REALLY lost using this. I'm not sure who to contact about this, but it's I-27, not I-29, that runs through Lubbock."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"I ordered this book based on not only my love of the Tolkien Universe but on the recommendations of those who have seen it. I am very disappointed with the book. The drawings and text bring nothing of the flavor of Tolkien's World to the page and serve only to remove the beauty of his language from the stories. As a research tool, this book is useless and as a hobbyist's edition, it is not worth the paper it iss printed on. If you are looking for a description of Tolkien's world, head to The History of Middle-Earth as edited by Christopher Tolkien. These provide as much information as the atlas does, and in a way that makes it much more interesting and keeps the imagination alive."
3,Interesting but not essential,"There are a lot of nice things about this book, but it has a number of disappointing flaws. There are quite a few geographical questions that were left unanswered for me (my primary reason for buying it) and the graphics make the information a little hard to glean. There are certainly some maps I enjoyed, but (perhaps because every serious fan has their own pet interests) I did not feel the author capitalized on the opportunity the concept of the book represents."
5,THE ATLAS IS GOOD TO USE WHILE READING THE BOOK.,"THIS ATLAS HAS MANY GOOD THINGS TO LOOK AT AND A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION. I HAVE LOOKED AT ALL THE MAPS AND READ SOME OF THE BOOK. IT TELLS HOW FAR THEY WENT IN ONE DAY AND ANY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAPPENED, ALONG WITH GREAT MAPS. AND THE BATTLE MAPS ARE WONDERFUL WITH DETAILS ABOUT HOW MANY MEN,ELVES,ORCS ECT FOR EVERY BATTLE!! IF YOU WANT A DETAILED MAP ALL ABOUT THE JOURNEY, THEN GET THIS BOOK IT IS VERY HELPFUL IN VISUALIZING THE WORLD. TheLoneRoman2002"
4,"If you love Tolkien, ya gotta have this book!",A few errors but all in all a wonderful companion to Tolkien's works. These maps take you 'there'. There's a comparison chart tracing Bilbo's steps to the Lonely Mountain by way of Rivendale and then traces the Fellowship's footsteps to Rivendale and then on to Mordor. Charts showing buildings and caverns make these places come alive. I keep this book and The Guide to Middle Earth next to whatever Tolkien book I am reading or re reading! Ya just gotta have this book!
3,"Better than nothing, but very disappointing","This book looks like someone's old college doctoral project. It's OK, but in consideration of the renewed interest in all things Hobbit brought about by the new movie series, this is really a very disappointing and lack-luster work. The maps are unicolor (all shades of brown or tan) and flat - no attempts at topological representation anywhere - and have the ""look and feel"" of maps drawns for a college project rather than professional cartography. Most of the text is reprinted from various Middle Earth stories with a few original comments from the author, but not much is added to the overall commentary of the Middle Earth. The multiple errors in the maps are discussed in other reviews of this book, so I won't repeat that.It is not a bad collection of line drawings of the geological features of the Middle Earth, but given the computer graphical imagery available to any college student today, it is far, far short of what it should be."
5,THE BEST OUT THERE!,"This book is amazing. It is like taking one of the original maps of Middle Earth and zooming way into it. There is a map of the shire, enemy paths in war. It also includes maps of the FIRST AGE, SECOND AGE, THIRD AGE. As well, it includes maps from the THE HOBBIT, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and THE SILMARILLION. THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH incudes REGIONAL MAPS and THEMATIC MAPSYet this book is not for everyone. If the movies are the things your crazy about, this book is not for you(it just matches to the books, so you might not get everything). You have to love the books and love the setting to get the most out of THE ATLAS OF MIDDLE EARTH.ENJOY!!!!"
4,A Fantastic Research Work,"This is an excellent work on several levels.It is well researched; the author pulled from every possible source in order to produce accurate maps.Tolkein scholars and hardcore enthusiasts will find it useful and informative in giving a visual depiction of Tolkein's words and because it contains maps of even the most obscure events as well as thematic maps that it would never occur to most people to wonder about.Dabblers or people having a hard time following the action in The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings will appreciate the many maps showing everyone's movements, including action in different locations that occured at the same time.The only real downside to this book is the lack of color. Black and white and shades of grey and brown are all that were used. A wider color palate would have been great fun.A great work over all."
4,The bindings may waylay your journey through ME,"My feedback to the author/publisher would be this: please format the (2-page) maps layout so that the binding does not inhibit the reading of the maps. Just as printed text has margins/gutters, so should maps in a case like this. I often found myself wrestling with the book to see what was being swallowed up by the binding.Otherwise, I have found the content to be a great companion while reading through Tolkeins works."
2,Pan arrived broken,"Ordered this product by mistake and decided to keep just in case I needed, but when I was going to use it cake pan was bended on the edge. I wouldnt have been a problem if it wasnt for the aluminum splinter i got on my finger. Returning this item. I bet they knew it was like that and sent it anyway. very dissapointed."
3,Brigh to a fault,"The 3 LED lights are amazingly bright - in fact, too bright. The light is almost too much of an intense white to use as a booklight - the light reflecting off the book hurts my eyes. In addition the housing of the LEDs is made of translucent plastic and the bright LED lights shine right thru in a very annoying fashion. I fixed this by wrapping black electrical tape around the LED casing. Still, all in all a pretty cool booklight."
4,Different But Still COOL,"I got this album not knowing what to expect, but these two guys compare to nothing else I've heard before. The cheesy carboot-vinyl samples they use in each track are good for a laugh especially during ""Whoosh,"" where a corny Disney-style orchestra keep interrupting the big beats. The rhythms are infectious and the melodies are also well-fitting. Bottom line: I'm laughing as I'm dancing listening to this."
4,Stands up to repeated listening,"None of the songs on this album have the easy hooks needed for club/radio play, but that doesn't matter. The quality is consistent - it's a rare album where I enjoy every song. It's a bit goofy in places, it's a bit long, but it's managed to stand up to repeated listening, something few albums (especially techno) do. If they had another album, I'd buy it."
4,fluid funky tongue in cheek rough stuff!!,"pop will eat itself one of the most innovative ""grunge"" bands in the uk in the eighties would have done this if they had thought aboutit earlier. as it is the ex members here have put some fine humour into a genre that sometimes dissapears up its own posterior. great big funky albumthat is still listenable 2 years later also worth ckecking ""fsuk3"" which is a mix album by the bentleys out on ministry of sound i do belive."
4,A great peice of Civil War history.,"This CD is a good buy for any Civil War buff. Even though it was intended for use as a soundtrack I would recomend it. It has many of the time honored songs that we associate with the period and the sound quality is great. I bought this CD with the intention of useing it in a high-school U.S History class, but it as has good non-educational merit."
4,great companion to pbs series,"I love the civil war series on PBS. It really got me into history. It was a real landmark in my life, and listening to this cd brings all that back. For the CD itself, the beginning is stronger than the end, with the haunting Ashokan Farewell, the 'main' theme for the series coming up early along with the always recognizable Battle Hymn of the Republic and Dixie.The other thing I loved is that I don't really listen to any other music that reminds me of my days in band in High School. There is a lot of band music here and it's a really great change of pace to modern music."
5,Perfect companion,This recording makes you feel like you live in the 1860's. It's authentic and just beautifully made. One of the many reasons for the greatness of Burns film was the music as the photos were being shown. This soundtrack is proof. A must have for fans of the series and Americana .
5,Best CD I've heard in years,"This is one CD that I couldn't just borrow. Even after taping it, I just flat out didn't want to return it to the library. It's too good. The tunes are haunting. The Ashokan Farewell was the one which became identified with the Civil War series. You haven't heard Shenandoah until you've heard it played here on a cello. This CD also includes the famous love letter from Sullivan Ballou to his wife on the eve of the battle that killed him. This poignant love letter is a masterpiece of writing and one you won't soon forget. Definitely worth buying!"
5,Nostalgic,"The soundtrack relives the film in every way. More Civil War history is provided in the jacket of the CD with information about each song, including the words. My favorite is 'Lorena'--probably the most popular Confederate tune. This is an excellent example of what a soundtrack should be.Like the production, this soundtrack is a haunting and enchanting rendition of the most terrible conflict on our soil."
3,Civil War Music,"Kind of a mishmash. Some of the selections are great: i.e.Ashokan Farewell, others vary in volume and I have to turn the volume control up and down. The spoken word tracks are disruptive to the flow of the CD."
4,Revisiting Ken Burns (Again),"These pieces are all excerpts from the Ken Burns CIVIL WAR series, including, at the end, the letter Union officer Sullivan Ballough of Rhode Island, sends to his wife two weeks before his death at First Bull Run. The quality of the music is excellent. Don't know why I can't give it a perfect grade."
4,Historically accurate.,"When compared to the Frenell 1963 recording, it is very good; however, if I had not heard ""The Civil War: Its Sounds and Music"" before I listened to this recording, I would have rated it as Excellent."
5,The Music Makes the History Come Alive,"I, like so many others, was transfixed by Ken Burns' series. The music is what made the images and narration more lifelike to me. It evokes the entire era - the sentimentality - the sorrow - the determination of both sides in the righteousness of their cause. I take this CD with me on visits to the actual battlefields; it helps me to visualize the stunning events that unfolded there so long ago. So much of this music is familiar to me personally, being descended from farmers from Georgia, Alabama and DEEP East Texas, most of whom fought for the Confederacy. This is the music of my grandparents and all those who came before them. As such, it keeps their memory alive in a small yet important way."
1,Ugh!?!?,I was not impressed. This is an OLD DVD with a new release date on it. I thought I was purchasing a DVD with new footage but instead it's footage from the 70's maybe 80's. Very boring.
5,Brings the subject alive!,"Mr. Aquilina made the Fathers of the Church come alive for me. Through his compelling stories of these courageous men's lives, I came to see that people like Ambrose, Athanasius, Tertullian, and all the rest are not just ""THE Fathers"" but rather, ""MY Fathers"" who left me an incredible inheritance: The saving Truth of Jesus Christ. A great book!"
1,Description in Error,"The WS1405 I received was not 5/16"" round nose but a 5/8"" diameter (5/16R). Best to verify with another supplier before believing what you read. The picture appears to be correct, assuming the shank is 1/4"", but that's not what I got."
2,Great idea but poorly made!,My [...]has been desperate to learn how to yo-yo. She is not yet cordinated enough and the basic beginner ball bearing yo-yo that she was given is too frustrating. I thought that this would be a great alternatve that she could get the concept with. It was a hit. Helped with rhythm and coordination.However after 2-3 days of mild use the layers of the jelly fish started to unstick and fall off. I would have rather paud a dollar or 2 more for a product that did not just fall apart after a few days play.
5,Definitivamente cambió mi vida!,"Es un libro con una impresionante capacidad de abrirnos hasta tocar nuestro más profundo y verdadero poder personal. Definitivamente cambió mi vida y más aún me mantiene en la senda del cambio con solo releer las páginas que necesito leer en cada nueva situación que se me presenta o cuando siento que me alejo del camino de mi poder interior... y regreso...

5,It can change your life,"I love Louise L Hay. I use these books as gifts to people who have forgotten the power we have inside. the translation into Spanish is great. Si has olvidado tu poder, si has perdido la fe por la vida, si te sientes perdido, enfermo, deprimido... comienza por aquí. a veces solo hacen falta unas pocas palabras, para regresar a la luz. el poder está en ti. este libro te ayudará a recordarlo. saludo al dios en ti!"
3,ok but not wonderful,Gets the job done is of good quality but I'm not hot on the wood hook on the heel as it's uncomfortable to grab and harder to manipulate than similar designs with a knob or loop on the heel.
2,Waaay too big,Even though I used the pull-down menu to select an X-Small - I still received a Medium Shoe Tree. They are far too huge to be useful to me for shoes. I'll just hang them in the closet to protect my sweaters....
3,aquatics video,It was good enough for what it was...isn't the best I've seen. I love blue planet videos shows more organisms.
4,Deep sea learning adventure,"This is a great film about life thriving in the most extreme, desolate conditions known to man, perfectly demonstrating how life always reconciles with its environment to establish a relationship of coexistence.The film begins with a steady descent for miles and finally exploring the colonies of living creatures betrayed by the light of the sun and ostracized by normal marine life only to find sustenance in the toxins discharged by the stomach of our earth's core.Another positive value to this feature was the calming energy it instilled inside me. It was a great film to watch before bed."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed with the content. I expected to see actual volcanoes, since that is what the title indicated. An example would be the volcano off the coast of Hawai'i that is building a new island on the sea floor. Other than that, it was OK for what it showed."
4,"Like the board game, but more","The Risk II computer game is a lot like the original board game (same map, same rules, etc.) but there are even more option. You can add territories and add conections between territories. You can play by yourself, against the computer, or over the internet. One thing I liked about playing Risk II on the computer was that things go a lot quicker than if you're playing the board game (i.e. you can practicaly fast-forward the computer vs. computer battles). Another thing about playing on the computer is that you can learn the rules really quickly if you've never played before because the computer will prompt you as to what is going on and what you have to do. The only problem I have is that your computer enemies can be a bit erratic, and you never know what they will do. Of course this also adds a little something to the game as well. But overall, if you like the board game you'll love the computer game. If you've never played the board game you'll love the computer game."
1,Disappointment,"I had the original PC game of RISK which was and still is unbelievably fun and full of variety. This Macsoft version simplified too much of the former options that existed in Risk I. I cannot recommend this game. Hopefully, they improve it by bringing back all that was in the first RISK. Incidentally, I keep around my old PC just to play the former RISK.I have since given it to my daughter who like the geopgraphy but also got bored with it in a month."
2,Net play broken,"Risk II is quite a bit of fun when playing against the computer. But if you want to or plan on using the internet to play with your friends, be warned that when the person who gathers the game loses the entire game ends. Very frustrating."
1,returned,Product didn't work. I love RISK II but this adaptation does not work on the IMAC. I returned it satisfactorily. I am satisfied but still looking for a good Mac version of RISK II.
3,Question for Risk II takers,"Does anyone know how to actually save the game to your Mac? Everytime we've installed it, then tried to play the game without the CD, it doesn't work. It also doesn't allow us to save the stages we're on so we can go back to that same level when we're logged back on. Do you think it's an installation thing? Or is it a Mac thing? and is it resolveable? Would appreciate any advice...."
1,What a Disappointment,"I so wanted this game to be fun; I have been waiting for it for a long time. But the classic version of this game is dull, difficult to follow and disappointing. The excitement of the roll of the dice in Risk battles is prolonged by unnecessary graphics, and the redeployment is confusing. What a shame!"
4,Fantastic!,"It's a bit crazy how cheap this thing is considering how important it is! I couldn't live without it when making a cake. It cuts your cake layers perfectly even, quickly and easily. Such a simple product that is so essential. If you haven't bought anything besides your Wilton Student kit, I recommend this as the first thing on your list.For those having trouble with the cake getting damaged, it's not the leveler, it's just how you're using it. It's not a serrated knife so it doesn't cut the same way.Start by sawing slightly into the cake, then just BARELY saw back and forth with the cutting hand and slowly turn the cake through the leveler with your other hand. Cuts perfectly without damaging the cake a bit!"
3,Ehhh..,"I like the product. It's good at what it's meant to be used for, but I'm taking off a few stars because I received mine without one of the rubber grips. I know it's not that much of a big deal and doesn't really affect it much, but when I order something it's to be expected that you receive all of the product without missing pieces."
3,Good buy for the price.,"This cake leveler is kind of cheaply, but it has gotten me through needing cakes and tiered birthday cakes, so for the money I can say it has done everything I've wanted"
4,Horizontal cake slicer,Simple product and it worked fine. You need to use both hands to maneuver the cake and slice at the same time. Use your passive hand to turn the cake while you hold the cutter with your dominant hand.
3,Some learning curve required.,"It is like a metal clothes' hanger with a steel wire shaped like a bow. My wife and I used this and were just half successful in cutting our cake. We have to be very careful as the crusty outside part of the cake crumbles. I tried slowly; I tried to swing it to and fro like a saw, still came up with a less than perfect cake.Both arms have notches (probably an eight of an inch apart) to adjust for the desired height. Even so, you can use this only on moderate height cakes, not much room for taller cakes. It is not a blade; it is just a piece of steel wire not much different from what you see on a guitar string.A bread knife will do better if only you can do it with a guide to make sure the top is completely parallel to the base."
3,great but not so great,"this would be perfect if the handle was thicker...and if your cakes are not frozen! I bought this at the last minute out of desperation...for $3 at walmart, it was worth it considering my cake was due very soon! Leveling with a knife takes lots of time when you're inexperienced, but for the price it was worth it..."
2,Cake Cutter,"This is only good for very small & very moist Cakes.It's ""ok"" if you just can't level a Cake with a knife.Personally I prefer using a nice corrugated knife to level Cakes"
1,did not buy this,i dont know why i need to give feedback for something i did not buy...did someone use my card to buy this?
4,Handy light for Kindle 2,"I picked up a Spike light at a local store, hoping to use it with myKindle 2for reading, and it works quite well.I use this light with my Kindle in the Amazon Kindle Leather Cover and while the gap on the light is a little bit too wide, it still fits fairly well. Once I'm settled in and reading, I don't notice it wobbling, but if it did a little bit of electrical tape or soft velcro wrapped around one section of the light clip would be enough to tighten it up. On a thicker cover, I'm sure it would fit perfectly.Once positioned in place, I've found that the gooseneck arm is sturdy enough to keep the light from gradually sinking out of position. Being 2 small LEDs powered by a AAA battery, it isn't the brightest light ever, but certainly enough for reading the Kindle in a dark room.Overall, a nice little light for $12, I'll be picking up another one to keep one in my travel case and one by my reading chair."
1,Broke almost immediately,"This thing broke almost immediately. The part that holds in the battery is, for no reason at all, three separate pieces held together with thin plastic clips, which have to resist an insanely powerful spring. One reviewer here mentioned duct tape; we're using electrical tape (it's a better size) to try to hold this thing together, but it's tough to even tape together because the spring inside is so stupidly oversized.For the same price, I'm getting three book lights shipped from Hong Kong."
3,Really liked this until it broke,"I thought this was a great light, until it broke. I was changing the batteries, and admittedly, couldn't remember how to open the case up, and I twisted it the wrong way and it broke. It needs a tiny hinge of plastic to stay together, and when that breaks, it's pretty much garbage. If only it were a little more idiot proof to get the top off to replace the batteries. Otherwise, the light was bright, and I also liked the flexible neck."
2,Poor design,"The light barely illuminates the page on a book. You have to constantly adjust the angle of the reflector, even with fresh batteries. Additionally, the battery case cover broke early on and I have had to hold it on with a rubber band, which is bothersome. I would not buy this again."
4,Study anywhere,The Spike light is great. My son can now read any time and place. I usually had to drive with the dome light on which is unsafe but now he uses his light. He keeps the Spike Light and extra batteries in the glove box of the car so it is handy. It is small and flexable and fits right on his book.
3,Bright but...,"I like that the neck is long and the light isn't concentrated into a small area but because the ""clip"" is rounded, the light has a tendancy to rotate."
2,Not as useful as it seems at first,"This seemed like a nice little book light at first, but after using it I find the light is too dim and I have to constantly adjust the light on the page to see the page well. The battery life is fairly short, and now after a few books the top of the battery case (where the stem attaches) has broken. It is made of cheap, fragile plastic. I would advise looking around for better quality."
3,Too weak,I needed a night light to read without bothering others so I tried this one. But I thought the light was too weak and the arm didn't bend enough. I had to return it.
4,Spike Light book light,"This is my fourth or fifth book light purchase. All before Spike Light were either complete junk or just not quite sufficient. But finally, the Spike Light is what I thought a good book light should be. The elongated light covers both pages at once, very important, with sufficient light to read in the dark. The metal neck is long enough to allow adjustment. The way the light attaches to a book is good, but I haven't tried it on a paperback yet -- it might not work as well as on a hard cover. Another reviewer stated there were no directions on the packaging as to how to open the battery comparment. Someone, possibly the same person, said they broke the light trying to open the battery compartment. I did find the instructions on the packaging telling how to open the battery compartment. It truly was slightly tricky to open but, without using force, I was able to get it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this light."
1,Not Versitle,"I'm not sure why I thought this would be helpful. The light works fine, but because it's not adjustable it's really limited in it's use.I bought it to use as a book light for my Kindle and for books. It does not work well for either. I ended up buying another light that has a clip."
1,It Stinks!!,"If there were more light power to it, I'd give it a much better review, but it doesn't and it stinks! Definitely go with another product."
2,Not great,"I mostly use the light to read paperbacks in bed since my regular night lightbothers my husband who is sensitive to light at night. I find the thing so unwieldy.The clip is pretty wide to begin with, so you need to attach it to lots of pages andit slides around and falls so easily. It is so dang annoying. I no longer use it and havegiven it to my son to use as an evening flash light."
2,very ordinary; waste of money,"I bought this light to read in buses and trains traveling up and down the east coast. I am not very happy with it. This light fits only books and only those that are at least 150 pages+. If you have notes or printed documents/journal articles, then there is no way to use this light.It cannot be affixed to anything except for a book spine, and that makes it extremely inconvenient to use.When I bought it, I was happy that it would use only one AAA battery, but I quickly saw the downside to that when I bought it. The LED bulb doesn't burn very brightly at all. This light would help ONLY if the light above your bus/train seat would work, but not otherwise.I recommend buying the only slightly more expensive Mighty Bright light with a clip, that can be attached to a computer screen, the seat handle in front of you, anything. It is better and brighter."
1,Not Enough Light,I bought the light because it takes AAA battery but it doesn't give enough light for reading. Not sure how others can read with this light but I can't. I wouldn't recommend this light.
2,Broke !,"When I tried to open the tube to put the battery in, the clips that keep it together broke. Now every time I use it, I have to re- duct tape it together.Otherwise, it would have been a good light."
3,"Misleading title, these are not extended versions","These are live versions that we have all heard before, and are not extended versions of anything.Misleading.It gets three starts because it is NOT the fault of the good songs on this CD that they were mis represented."
3,worth buying for the live version of ONWARD.,"This album is essentially the live disc of KEYS TO ASCENSION,PART 1, albeit minus one or two songs. For those of you, likeme, that didn't feel like dishing out 20 bucks for that album,this cheapie is definitely worth having, at least for just onesong. The live version of ONWARD is positively gorgeous, witha nice little classical guitar solo by STEVE HOWE at the beginn-ing. I actually prefer this to the studio version from TORMATO!This is one of the best love songs YES ever wrote! The rest ofthis isn't bad either, especially the version of AWAKEN.WORTH BUYING!"
3,Extended Versions -- Same old stuff,"Compilation of some of the group's more well-known versions. If you are a Yes fan already, then don't bother with this album, because you already have every song and version on it. If you are new to Yes, this is a good album to buy to get a great sample of what you are in for."
1,'Extended' is a series of misleading releases flooding the market,"Various artists have these Extended compilations made for them behind their back that are nothing more than a condensed repackaging of live material. In this case, this is steals material from Keys to Ascension. This release was not official endorced - see the discography page of yesworld.com for official releases."
4,Great concert cd.,"I don't have this cd, but I do have ""Keys to Ascension"" Vol 1. which has the same songs, except on this cd one live and two studio tracks are missing that are from the original ""Keys"" release, if the sound quality is like the ""Keys"" cd! this cd is well worth it at this great low price."
5,extended versions,nice compilation of 60+ minutes of live favorites on one disc at a give-away price. all yes fanatics must acquire this disc.
2,not a very nice book!!,The book does not cover very good examples on each topic specially on Datatypes. Also it is not exclusive on detailing schemas. The kind of material/information provided by this book can be read from any core xml book. XML Bible describes the Schemas very well in one chapter.
2,Not the original recording,"This is a live recording, not the original album.I love the original album. The low rating is because the CD is advertised as the original recording; but it is NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDING. Nowhere on my CD does it say that it is a live recording. I want to thank the previous reviewer Lynn VERY MUCH for the review.I am old enough to have bought the original vinyl album and I bought this CD many years ago because I wanted to replace my old vinyl LP with a CD. This disc never sounded right to me. It always sounded off. I am older and my ears are not so good and my memory is not so good. Not until I read the previous review by Lynn did I realize that this is a live recording! Ya gotta laugh!The original vinyl album was great."
4,An excellent album finally gets the remastering it deserved.,"This limited edition disc boasts an improved sound quality usually found only on remastered ""gold disc"" reissues. ""Aqualung"" and ""My God"" benefited the most, as both tracks sound terrific. The slight ""fade"" in the recording during the early part of the title track - quite noticeable in the Chrysalis CD - has been corrected. ""Aqualung"" includes several bonus tracks, some of which were originally part of the now deleted ""20 Years of Jethro Tull"" collection. Among them are a few gems recorded for BBC radio circa 1968, as well as the magnificent ""Lick Your Fingers Clean,"" an ""Aqualung"" leftover. This CD also has a rather lenghty interview with Ian Anderson. It's still available on record and bookstores despite no longer being made, so grab it while you can!"
4,Someone please help regarding Jethro Tull remastered CDs,"What is wrong with ""this version"" of the CD? People give ""this version"" one stars, and the original CD/vinyl version four and five stars. Why? What is wrong with this later version's remastering?There are also a few unfavorable reviews about the remastering of ""Thick as a Brick"" and ""A Passion Play."" Why is this? What the problems with the remastered sound on these reissues?Please help.Thanks."
5,The best that Tull ever put out!,"It's rare when I award 5 stars to anything. It has to be not only a great work, fun to listen to, and able to stay fresh no matter how many times you crank it up, but also has to be VERY original. This CD fits all those categories. The style and the power of these songs mix extremely well, starting with the opening salvo of ""Aqualung"" and continuing all the way through ""Wind Up"". This is one of those few albums where there is not a single bad song on it. Of course ""Locomotive Breath"" is the absolute hightlight of the CD, and (with Aqualung) is still a mainstay of every Tull concert to date. I usually try to temper every review with a lowlight as well, but here there really isn't one. If you're looking to find out what Jethro Tull was all about this CD would be the place to start."
3,I need to explain,"I did not buy this album for myself but to please my boifriend.It is one of those bands with who I have a ""love-hate"" relationship (same with Bob Dylan and Neil Young). No middle, I really love the song or really hate it. Why is that? Because I cannot stand folk. I have to admit that they make really good music but having a tendancy to abuse a bit on the flute. Songs I really like: Aqualung - Cross eyed Mary - My god - Hymn 43 - Locomotive Breath - Bouree. On the counterpart, I just go insane when I hear Mother goose - Wond'ring aloud - Up to me - Slipstream - and worst of the worst : beginning of Wind up.Can't love them all"
2,stupid songs no one likes,"both of my brothers had this so I decided to join in in a fit of dumbness. Gosh how i was in for a fat surprise, despicable thtemes ans lame songs, not so good at all.I think Barry Manilow is even better than these untalented misicians.i am sorry to say, 2 say that is."
3,The sound is duller--,"--than their other remasters. Great album, but sound technology must have improved drastically from 1999 to 2003. Witness the Yes rems. from that year. Why don't they try again and get it up to speed? I suppose all there is now is the Japanese remaster for a very good recording on CD."
5,A Flute Playing Homo,"How could I have underestimated these guys for so long? I recently picked this LP up from a friend, yes a record. I do not know how it may sound on CD, but the true sound of any master piece should be heard from Vinyl.Having the right speakers to listen to this is key, hearing the scratching of the guitar, on Locomotive Breath. The precisely timed cord ripping through the song Mother Goose.The true way to hear this is on a quality Turntable, via nice vintage speakers.I will not deny I passed over this for many years, always digging the radio cuts on the FM. I am glad that I discovered it in it's entirety in 2011. So it's all new to me. I am lucky"
2,If the sound quality were there...,"Terrific album, lousy sound quality. I love this album, but don't understand why Capitol can't spend a few bucks remastering the thing. It sounds like it's from 3rd generation tapes--they could have done a better job recording the vinyl to CD. Very disappointing."
2,Why why why. . .,"did they have to mess up a great thing. As the previous reviewers stated, this is NOT a CD version of the original. It's getting nearly impossible to find ""original"" vinyl recordings on CD anymore. ""They"" have to add bonus tracks, re-mix, etc, etc. Too bad that those that never had the opportunity to hear the originals will never experience how great they were (unless they can find a copy on vinyl)."
5,Is the DCC Gold Disk Worth the money?,"The DCC version of this great album is worth the extra money indeed. The clarity and bass blows away the 25th Anniversary version that is out there, hands down."
5,aqualungus mcmungus,"och, und vender muusta ke shtein und valun. Der vin toggle mcboggle ootenoggle squishy mcmushy tooshy tooshy. QUARASHI!!!!!QUARASHI!!!!!! YUTEN SHTEIN MUSCA VON TUSCA ALA SHOOSHKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ver? a la peto de bismol. Muskat? ala no ter vin und chlos.MUSKA!!MUSKA!!MUSKA!!"
1,THE WORST SOUND QUALITY IN THE WORLD,"What is this? It has that terrible mismatch between the loud and quiet parts and just sounds overall lousy. I mean, this is Aqualung. Cuts from this on other issues sound fine. Also, I noticed this does not have liner notes written by Ian. Why? Is that because he does not endorse this terrible issue. I waited for it go on sale, and now it's just a smaller ripp off than it would have been...unbelievable...."
2,not very impressive,"I've heard a lot of people say how good this album is, but I can't get into it. For the life of me I can't see why it's supposed to be so great. The interlinking song themes are good, as are some of the lyrics, but the music is quite unadventurous and Ian Anderson's voice is gruff and monotonous. I think one difficulty may be the sound quality of this CD reissue - maybe with better sound i would have a different opinion."
1,"The WORST sound out there, remastered??","This is the WORST sounding CD i have ever heard, HANDS DOWN!! What's with these other reviews that the audiophile freaks say is sounding good on this cd? Even Ian himself has admitted there is no good master of Aqualung available anywhere. The original master was destroyed and an inferior master was used. This album was recorded in an old church turned into a studio where the sound and acoustics were terrible. Led Zeppelin had the same studio except a smaller room which made the sound better and more intimate. I have to turn my cd player up all the way on volume just to hear it. Ian himself says this is not one of their better releases in their day. Stand Up and Benefit blow this away. Not to say there isn't great songs on this release if only you could hear them. What a shame NONE of the Jethro Tull catalog has been remastered properly. I guess i'll try the Tull blu-spec cd and see how that sounds."
5,Aqualung - The Height of Jethro Tull,"Aqualung is without a doubt THE best albumJethro Tull has ever produced... Okey,Songs from the Woodis unbelievably Good.. The same with Benefit,Stand Upand the rest of Tulls work..But this album really stands out from the Bunch..If you ever are to buy JUST ONE Tull-album,then this is the one to buy..It is a concept-album which thumbsthe nose at establisment, and remindsus that not everyone falls within whatwe would define as the Norm..Aqualung (The main character) certainlydoes not,and he's quite happy with that..He lives his life as he pleases andscorns those who would try,in their ownselfinterest,to change his life for himwithout his consent..In short.. A Pearl of an album,which demands listening and thinkingat the same time.. Not an album for theaverage Britney Spears or Boyzone-fan.."
4,If you are looking for inspiration... Buy This Album,"The best music will inspire as well as entertain you. Some music can change you; this album can.I am a religious sort and do not agree with most of Ian Anderson's lyrics. But they challenge me to justify what I do believe and keep me questioning the truth. The second half of this album will separate the pretenders from the faithful. If you only listen to people that agree with you, then you have surrendered your individuality.And if that wasn't enough, there is the music. Today's music is made up of new ""sounds"" that are good for one, maybe two, songs. Aqualung is not the one dimensional music we are accustomed to today. It will take you on an emotional roller coaster. That is a big reason for its continued success today. This album almost seems to change each time you listen to it."
5,the best of one of the best,"Ian Anderson doesn't see Aqualung as his best work. Of course all creative artists should always look forward and believe that they are continually growing and improving their craft. But the fact is undeniable that every songwriter has one creative peak and this album is the peak of Jethro Tull. There was a lot of good music on This Was, Stand Up, Benefit and Living in the Past. But in Aqualung as well as in most of Thick As A Brick and the much maligned Passion Play, Ian was on a music making roll. Sad to say that, with the exception of parts of Songs from the Wood and Crest of a Knave, Ian has never been able recapture that spark. Sure his writing has changed to accomodate the fans, his interests and his diminished vocal resources. And while structurally speaking Budapest from 1987 may be as good as Ian likes to think it is. Creatively speaking, songwriting is a young man's game. What songwriter didn't do his best work during his first decade of recording?"
2,1997 Toshiba EMI Remasters,"Aqualung is a true classic album. I disappointed The sound quality, is the same of 1997 version, say print on CD: ""Digital Remasters 1997 Toshiba-EMI Japan. The CD was released in 2003 with the same sound of 1997 version. The package is beautiful, in gatefold mini Lp, with lyrics and a Aqualung cart. Maybe in future, the Remasters quality for this album be better than this, a classic album can may a better treatment.Unless you want a collectors item....don't waste your time if your looking for a better sounding cd."
2,"Great album, but the sound...",The album was remastered from a copy of the British stereo master tape and is the worst example of NoNoise abuse I have ever heard. Try the Gold CD version on DCC to hear what the album really sounded like when it was first released on Island/Chrysalis in the early 70s (that was remastered without NoNoise and from the original master) The bonus tracks sounded better on the 20th anniversary box set.
4,A plethora of detail woven into a complete tapestry.,"This is the best and most detailed examination of Project Mercury I've ever found. It was worth the price. The product starts by linking the genesis of Mercury to its time. Mercury did not spring into being in a short time, the work follows the early bits and pieces that slowly coalesced into Mercury. This is a good addition to the bookshelf of any serious space buff."
3,Reads like a text book.,"I was looking for more of a story, but there is a lot of information and history in this book."
4,Wilton 12-inch Featherweight Decorating Bag,"It is so easy to use. The bag comes in a nice size for those bigger projects. The tips I baught with another kit fit this bag easily. Unlike the disposable bags which you have to constantly buy over and over and never have when yoou need them, this bag washes easily in the diswasher and is there to use again and again! This bag is great for eggs to cakes and much more.. And, all of the food particles from the previous use are gone after washing so that none of your frosting tastes like what ever you used before. The only thing I wish would be different is the grade of the plastic, making it more sensitive to the pressure I exert on the bag when I use it for decorating."
2,smells like plastic,"I originally got this confused with another brand that I received. This one is plastic, and not nice like the clothe bag I received from another company. This one is a cheap plastic bag, possibly with PVC leaching out of it. Can't recommend it."
4,Great for the whole family,It is wonderful. Something the whole family can enjoy and never get tired of.
4,Fun!,This CD is fun. I dont like all the songs on it but most are fun and my son likes to sing along.
3,Like The CD But Something Just Didn't Do It For Me,"While I enjoyed Risotto some of the songs left me wanting a little bit more. Don't get me wrong, it's a good cd and I recommend it, I just think there are better cds worth getting."
5,Best God Damned Album Ever.........!,"My name is Nathan, (i use my moms credit card for buying things).This is such a great album, i got hooked from MTV watch ing the music video of atom bomb over and over and over and over........etcBrillient Ambience and techno soundz. Two thumbs up."
4,Yummy. Transporting.,"An album to listen to all at once. There are no real move it and shake it tracks, though a few come close, but the entire thing holds together very, very well. Although I found the lyrics pleasantly surreal, the quality of the voice delivering them was out of synch with the lyricism of the music. Nonetheless, this is a wonderful, magical work, which should be given its full time to enjoy"
4,Well worth a read,"A decent book which is only one of a few that specialise in cash games. Much of this should be basic fundamental poker to the experienced winning player, however as a professional myself I certainly did take away profitable tips from the books that were easily incorporated into my game for better results. Certainly well worth a read for someone committed to improving."
4,Good Solid info for new players to low limit -No limit,Good book for new players of low limit no limit - covers more the brick and mortar game - not as much as the interent game which I feel is different but accompishish the same thing - the starting hand charts are invaluable for newbies. Would reccommend for newbies starting out. Doesnt get too indepth - but that is a good thing if your just starting out - because there is no reason to out think yourself playing at the low limits.(50 and 100 but in's)
2,This book is a little too basic.,"In this book, the authors try to help the reader learn to win at no-limit holdem. The problem witht the this book is that the book only gives enough information to give the player a false hope at the game. While the book doesn't offer any ""bad"" advice, it doesn't offer enough ""good"" advice, in that it addresses the basics of poker theory, and then goes about how to apply these basics to no limit holdem. To really win at no limit holdem, the basics just aren't enough. Psychology is much more important, and this book just leaves the player too predictable and too uninformed to do some serious damage at the tables. This book has the player playing a more limit style of poker, which doesn't work in no limit. It doesn't discuss the difference between a big pot or a small pot, which has a major affect on whether a player is a real winner or not. Get Doyle's and Harrington's books (all of them) and don't go overboard."
4,Good book for beginners,"Well I think this is a quite good book, but especially for beginners. People can understand the differences between limit and no-limit hold'em, but that's all. You won't master your no-limit skill with this book. Of course there are chapters that are good, for example the Odds and Betting Strategies and the Position. If you are new you should read it, but be ready to buy other better books that can give you the essence of no-limit hold'em. For example the magnificient Little Green Book by Phil Gordon or if you want to play absolutely an expert level and want to take part in tournaments the Harrington's books are waiting for you. All in all this is a good book for beginners, before more serious ones.Buy it but be ready to buy another ones!"
3,Pleasant enough background music,"This is the kind of CD that you pop into the deck for that after work wind down. It doesn't ask much of you - sorta yoga muzak/elevator music. It's okay, but if I had listened to the whole CD before I plunked down my money, I probably would have just checked it out from the library. Hey, I'll sell you my copy if you are still interested in purchasing - It's practically brand new."
1,Can't get my head around lesser versions of hit songs .......,"His great sound got me interested, but the tunes he wrote don't sustain that interest, although they obviously got the Higher Octave label interested enough to sign him and re-release part of this album on his debut there.What stops me playing this album is the OK versions of hit tunes. I don't want to hear ""Can't Make You Love Me"" unless Bonnie Raitt is singing it, and similarly I don't want to hear ""How Do I Live"" unless either LeAnn Rimes or Trisha Yearwood is singing. If you like those vocals, think carefully before buying this."
2,Where's the beat?,I bought this CD and was dissapointed that the song I heard on the radio which had an uptempo steppers beat was not on the album. Instead I got a cd full of elevator music that quite frankly is sub-par at best. If you like that sort of thing then this is for you.
2,"not like this Josh, not like this","It seems Joshua wanted to make some quick money. The stuff in this book is nothing new and nothing exiting. What about your crazy random experimental stuff Josh ? What about the sound, 3d and everything we go visit your website man ?"
2,Comfort grip cookie cutters,"I have several of the Comfort grip cookie cutters. Their intended purpose is to cut dough, and they do that well. However, after several uses and washings, the comfort grip gets, well, gunky. Sometimes it's better to forego all the latest and greatest products and stick with plain old-fashion basics. This is one of those times."
2,An OK movie,"I believe this was one of Zen's movies early releases, If you're familiar with themyou know what to expect, lots of action sequences and girls in skimpy clothes. Theproblem here is that the actress that plays the lead character doesn't have much ofa personality (and acting ability) , so you really never care much for her. Thereare plenty more titles from Zen's pictures to choose from."
1,Rent it first...you might not want it!,"There is a good but old (1981)bit of animation titled The Fly, and a great bit of documentary about the French Cote de Azure. The animation has been around for a long time and the documentary is incomprehensively in French only with no subtitles, so if you don't speak the language...good luck! The rest of it consists of things like two musicians (???They don't seem to get around to really playing any music) mumbling incoherantly about the ""philosophy"" of their art. and a Hip-Hop documentary which seems to tell you they have covered the scene in Brazil and eleswhere (but doesn't)after covering the Hip-Hop scene in several other places. It just didn't get to me, somehow. I'd be very cautious about plunking down your hard earned cash for this without seeing it first."
1,there are idiots,and then there are scumbag idiots like lars von trier (sorry buddy you're the ahole). if you dislike america so much you should have stayed in denmark you buffoon.avoid
4,Not for the faint of heart!,"Great stuff! refreshing to here a bassist who manages to draw on inspiration from other masters, both past (Jaco) and present (Marcus), without actually sounding like them. But for me, a bassist, incidentally, the real star of the show is Chambers: he's simply devastatingly creative and technically exquisite with time manipulation. Willis must agree, because the drums are mixed right in your face. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is the heavy leaniing towards technicality rather than musicality - you can't help concentrating on this music. Buy it!"
4,"wow, what talent!","This is a great CD, not only for those of you who, like me, love a great bass player, but also for those of you, like me again, who love great percussion. The technical side is great, without losing too much of the musicality. I can only give it four stars though, because nobody compares to Victor Wooten..."
1,This is hard to use,"Hi All,The spring is too hard to work for an adult female.Throws the clays well.Has sharp edges (cut myself, first round and was a bloody mess).The stamped metal legs REQUIRE the pegs be inserted firmly.Will NOT mount to a table.Pulls the legs out of the soil EVERY time you shoot.Basically IMPOSSIBLE to use by yourself (plan on a buddy).Using this trap is a LOT of hard work. Stick to a hand trap, smaller,cheaper, easier to use, weighs less.Save your money. A sit down trap is much better, if you have someone tohelp throw for you."
1,"Wow, really failed.","Bought this product to save a few bucks over the more expensive models. Well, as they say, you get what you pay for. Tried to hammer the feet into the ground but the shock of the arm releasing was too much for the unit to hanlde so it kept coming out of the ground. Also, the unit was extremely difficult to reload the spring. I am a pretty strong guy and I had a lot of difficulty cocking it for another release. I even tried to loosen the spring thinking I had it too tight but that did not help. Finally, the pull string broke after the third pull. Overall, you would be better off buying a hand held thrower."
5,"Great value, great quality","Bought this at cabelas. Assembled in about 15 minutes, broke clays at first but tightened the spring and it was fine. Throws pretty far, would throw farther if you tighten the spring down farther.Very happy overall, but mine didnt come with the stakes pictured."
1,The worst purchaise I have ever made.,The btteries in the ophthalmoscope were rusty and old causing the whole inside of the equipment rusty and makes it disfunctional. This equipment shouldn't be sold as it is a damaged and useless pice.
1,Empty promises,"As a reluctant mate, I found this book disappointing. Despite the refreshing title, once again, we have an enthusiastic male sailor rattling down the same old story. I recommend Diana B. Jessie's ""The Cruising Woman's Advisor"", in which cruising women, some of whom started out reluctantly, share their experience and give advice. If you're already hooked on sailing, this book does not tell you anything new, and if not, this definitely is not going to convince you of the opposite."
1,"Terrible, substandard product","IM Records strikes again with another substandard product. The artists are good, the song selections are excellent, but one thing the case fails to describe is that all the songs have been re-worked and re-mixed (terribly, I might add). These are not the same versions heard on the radio by millions of people, but crappy versions that were recorded decades later. Don't waste your money on IM Records cds and just download the songs.No compren este disco. Es un gasto de dinero. Lo que IM Records fallo decir es que estas no son las mismas canciones de la radio. Estas son versiones diferentes. Las versiones originales son las que valen el dinero y el tiempo. Esta disquera, IMR, es una facha."
5,Great selection,"My grandson is thrilled with this for his new man cave, I got the NFL to go with these pennants"
5,Very informative,this is a short book but very important for serious yoga practitioners. is a technical book of a topic that has not been given the proper importance.
4,NYC noise-rock gem,"If you're a fan of Pussy Galore, Free Kitten (Action Swingers features ex-Pussy Galore and Free Kitten guitarist Julia Cafritz), Sonic Youth (Action Swingers features ex-Sonic Youth drummer Bob Bert) then you really need to pick up a copy of this Stooges-influenced gem."
1,Trash,"This book is a joke to be put in the trash with other garbage like books by Eric von Daniken. NATIVE AMERICANS built the mounds and were not influenced by Atlantians, Celts, Romans, Hebrews, or anyone other then Native American mound builders to come before them. To say that Native Americans could not have conceived the mounds is racist, pure and simple. This debate was put to rest over 100 years ago and it is laughable that there are still books and ""scientists"" disputing the FACT that Native Americans built these mounds."
4,P is for Passport review,"This is a beautifully illustrated alphabet book on geography. Each page has a two-page illustration, with a rhyming verse on the topic (i.e. P is for People), and a side-bar with more in-depth information.One warning: ""K is for knapsack"". Why use a silent ""k"" for the K page? If you are trying to teach your children letter sounds via this book, this page is confusing.I would recommend this for libraries and schools, but don't think it's a ""Must Have"" for home."
5,Comprehensive applications & market opportunities revealed!,This book really explains DSL technologies in a language that is easy to comprehend. More importantly it also lists many applications and sizes market opportunities. Lots of very useful statistics. This simple book has generated several ideas which I hope to turn into business opportunities. I highly recommend it!
4,broadband technologies explained,Broadband technologies coupled with comprehensive examples of applications make this a worthwhile addition to your library.
1,Just for beginners,"As a part of a technical education program, I bought this book but found it extremely basic in terms of technical details that you might need in real world xDSL delivery networks. It could be recommended as a basic resource for getting a bit of background information on DSL technologies."
4,provides good & useful information,"This book provides good and useful information on DSL technologies. Too bad the industry fell into the dumpster -- they should've read the book especially the chapters on economics, applications and services. Yep, now we're all ""X-DSL""."
3,An early propositional inventory of knowledge about human behavior,"I bought this inventory of findings about human behavior several decades ago (while I was an undergraduate student at Bradley University). At that time, it was a useful volume, summarizing propositions about human behavior.For instance, on page 304: ""The large majority of adults in all societies are married"". Or on page 413: ""On the whole, the higher the status of the members and the more satisfied they are, the more actively they participate in union affairs."" Page 509: ""As people move from one social group to another, they tend to take over the attitudes and practices of the new group. . . ."" Some of these propositions are certainly not earth shaking. Nonetheless, this was a nice effort to identify what we know about principles of human behavior, based on extant research of the time.Looking back at this now, it is not totally satisfying. Still, in its time, it made its own contribution."
1,i would not get it. It's a waste of your money.,i would not get this game it is horrible.It is boring and makes the game night seem like homework. Some of theese people are people we don't know. I think this game should be changed for either newer people or older people. You should really be serious to by this game. You have to be a B student trying to improove your grade to an A. I am an A student so i don't need to improove my grade.
4,different,the movie has its moments but for the most part i'm left wondering how daniel stern went from a star in the home alone movies to a B-lister in a matter of months...poor guy.
4,Very funny movie,Bushwhacked is a really good movie. Daniel stern plays a great part. I recommend this to anyone wanting a good laugh.
3,pretty funny,a lot of funny moments but alot of the jokes get very VERY old.i got to admit Daniel Stern is kind of annoying but he can be very funny explaining the birds and the bees in this movie
2,PG at it's worst,"This movie though rated PG is full of sexual comments and profanity. Daniel Stern even says Fu------dge. Unless you want your children to be taught the birds and the bees from a deviant loser I would steer clear of this Movie. In one scene all the boys are peeing on a man below for an extended amount of time. The children in it are entertaining overall, but Stern is an overboard actor. He is obviously acting the whole time, nothing about it is natural. The children do a decent job acting.If you are getting this for children, I would pick a different movie. I pitched my copy in the trash"
4,Content,Interesting material. Good if you want to be a facilitator. A lot of useful techniques mentioned in the book. Also good if you initiate to be a group leader.
4,Helping Create Collaboration,"Art of Facilitation is a well done and is not too complex or theoretical. The price is right for what you get and definately helps to create ""group synergy."" Others who are looking for group synergy ought to look atLeading Groups to Solutions: A Practical Guide for Facilitators and Team Members. I would recommend buying these together."
4,Great resource,"The book is easy to read and practical. It offers key insights, practical examples and some effective tools. Great for a solid introduction to facilitation skills."
5,Dividing a circle,"Forget the cake part of this product. If you ever need to evenly divide a circle into 2,3,4,6,8,10, or 12 parts, this gets the job done."
4,The I/O card review,"I think this is a very useful thing for graphics and isn't too hard to use, but I gave it 4* as not everyone will find it useful."
5,Silver Ladders,"I tried this CD after a reco from a friend in the US who attended a concert performance of Silver Ladders. It is a powerful piece with a memorable motif and striking orchestral sonorities. Sequoia is similarly powerful, the other pieces depend more on subtle instrumental colour. Joan Tower's music has a distinctive sound picture. The CD is worth it for Silver Ladders alone."
1,stuff gets stuck,I bake a lot. I mean A LOT and this pan is the pits. No matter what I did to prepare the pan before baking I either could not get the food out or it broke in the process.
3,not what I expected,"This video look right from the start like it was home made, as an intermediate exerciser I found the exercises way too easy.Eleonora Goya is an argentinan personal trainer and even thou she knows what she's doing, I got the feeling she got some friends together to help her out and make this video.I would not buy any other video of hers."
4,Book,"Written by my favorite child behavior advisor, Jim Fey. This was a gift and I did read this one before giving it. I thought it was excellenst and coined the parents/guardians right on. Highly recommend this book for parents and teachers."
4,Quick read,This book is quite a bit shorter than I expected. I read the whole thing in 30 minutes. It has good tips and advice in it. This would be a great coffee table book or one to keep in the bathroom.
5,A must have for EVERY parent,"This is a mini preview of a parenting method that is amazing. Love and Logic WORKS!! It does not matter the age of the child or behavior of the child...ADHD, to sweet angel. I have used this parenting method on my 10 month old and it works. My sister-in-law introduced me to Love & Logic before I was even a parent to start preparing. I read this book over and over again, along with the many other resources Love & Logic provides. Look up the other books and get them, it will be worth every penny...it will be priceless knowledge!!Update at age 3:This has been an amazing parenting method. My now 3 year old son is very well behaved and listens...granted he is not perfect and we go toe to toe but he backs down knowing that there will be consequences for his actions. Age 2 was very difficult but being consistant he has now learned that there are consequences for his actions both good and bad. I started early but it is never too late."
5,Fun Fast Informational,"Recommended by my pediatrician, this was a very fast read and really made it simple to look at the diferent parenting styles and help me determine just what I wanted to be for my son. And it's inexpensive. Order it."
1,yada,"a bunch of yada yada to fill the pages. I will be giving my book to charity. all it is, is eating natural foods and a very expensive line of his vitamins. gimme a break!"
3,Perricone Diet,"The book is pretty good as for telling you what natural supplements to take instead of all the diet junk being pushed on overweight americans. However, it still followed the trend of the South Beach and Atkins Diet books and had too many testimonials that took up most of the book. It would have been nice if he focused more on how to achieve results and less on what people have already done. I was looking for something a little different in that arena than the rest of the low carb diet books but overall, he had some interesting points."
3,Hard and Expensive,"I would love to be able to follow this plan but it is very expensive to buy all the food, then discard most of it because of how little you use in the recipes. Also, it is difficult to understand which lotions, creams, etc. are the right ones for you and are extremely expensive. I called his order number to get assistance on what I needed and was told to figure it out for myself then call back. Not very friendly. Unless you haves LOTS of money this is not affordable. Spent several hundred $$$ purchasing the product on ebay but gave up because I still didnt understand which products were best for my skin."
2,CAVEAT EMPTOR - Buyer Beware,"Buyer Beware - Before you buy this book - you would be wise to read ALL 46+ reviews on Dr. Perricone and his ideas. Some reviews are quite insightful and practical. Pease remember that Dr. Perricone himself recommends MODERATION - so too, the reader should exercise true moderation in how much he actually believes Dr. Perricone's ""prescriptions"". Like anything else - this book is NOT the Bible of weight loss - it's just another opinion that 'apparently' may work for some folks by not everyone. Buyer Beware."
1,Not recommended!,"The entire concept behind this new diet is an inflammatory, which as you can hear Dr. Perricone ""you cannot see or feel it"". Are you going to buy a diet based on something which actually does NOT exist? There is no such thing as ""groundbreaking scientific discoveries"" behind this book. The so called ""inflammation"" is a hypothetic which I am sure will be rejected by the medical community. The only doctors that recommend this book are authors of other books. By giving recommendation to it they get in return advertisement.There is one thing for sure and it is that you have to buy MANAY supplements from Perricone's web site which as you may know are very expensive. Expect to spend at least $600 just the firth week on this program. I am sure that there is nothing in this book that can really help you to lose significant amount of extra weight.To your best interest,Dr. Tahahiro Ouchi"
3,"""Small ingredients, big risk""","""Small ingredients, big risk"", from an article I read. DISCLAIMER: I do not own this particular book, so ""no"" rating... BUT I do own other Perricone books.Just an update: I read that Perricone cosmetic products use ""Nanotechnolgy"" it may not be good. ""Nano"" .1 to the 9th zero--it's very small, very. It may infiltrate cells in your body and brain--I don't know for sure--do the research for yourself. Here the link [...]"
2,Not even a complete shopping list,"I purchased this book because of the time it takes to assemble a shopping list for both ""The Perricone Promise"" and ""The Perricone Weight Loss Diet"". I thought this would do it for it. It lists a ""basic guideline for foods"", but it is not comprehensive of all the items needed to make the recipes on the two week diet. I'm still painstakingly going through the recipes to assemble my shopping list?"
4,Similar to Yummidy,"Reinforces most of the ideas found in the book 'Yummidy' with a few twists. Suggests a few more supplements. Doesn't really address the addictive side of lower glycemic foods that must be eaten with fats and protein to control blood sugar. Suggests that 50 different ways to eat salmon will make it enjoyable, which will help, but there is more to eating than salmon."
2,unrealistic,"I saw the Dr. on PBS and couldn't wait for this book.I got it and read it only to realize I could not afford to do this program!!!It would cost at least six hundred a month or more. I wish he would have made it all in a more simple form. I still have questions after reading it.I am disappointed, Peggy"
5,Nutritionist Approved,"As a nutrition professor, I am usually skeptical of diet fads, but bought this book after seeing Dr. Perricone on Oprah and Larry King a few months ago. It arrived last week (it hadn't been released until then), and I agree with everything he has to say. His approach is unique, as it does not simply focus on how many pounds you can lose like so many others, or follow an extreme regimen of one type of food (remember the cabbage soup diet?!?) - it is a well thought out balanced approach to losing fat without muscle mass, while improving the appearance of your skin. As a nutritionist, it was enlightening for me to see a diet book that explains how to prevent the sagging skin that usually accompanies successful eating plans, especially in older people that lose weight quickly. This book with all its research and references is being squeezed into my fall syllabus, and will be required reading for semesters to come!"
4,Makes sense,"The first thing I liked about this book was that it was not a fad type diet. Dr. P talks about doing this a a lifelong habit and includes other aspects that are important for longevity of youth and good health.That said, I thought the diet was very similar to the one promoted in South Beach diet, except for Dr. P promotes no grains/wheat foods.The recipes were well put together, did not take a lot of time to fix (30 minutes average), and were well liked by other family members, so no double cooking.As for the vitamin regimen, I did not follow everything recommended but added the fish oil and the glutamine to my daily multi-vitamin, and I have felt a definite difference in my energy and improved feel to my dry skin.I will add finally that I did not lose any weight - hence only 4 stars!!"
1,Compilation of Perricone's other books + a speculation,"I have some of Perricone's other books. That's why I was surprised to see that many suggestions and recommendations from them are included in the content of this book as well. The ""new"" thing is his speculation that obesity is caused by some inflammatory process in the body. He does NOT point out ANY studies or scientific evidence for his claim. That's why his book is yet another speculative diet. I am in the middle of his 14 days plan and I did not see ANY weight loss. However, I am $560 poorer because I had to buy expensive supplements from his web site. So, if you are more in the beauty benefits or want recommendations for vitamins, minerals, herbs etc. directly go to his site and order whatever you like. There is no need to waste your time reading his book."
1,Not a milk crate,These Storage crates are not milk crates. They are cheap hard sharp plastic bins that you can get at any office supply store. Horrible for kid storage.
2,Not as advertised,"Dimensions: Stated Width: 23"" Wide, was actually 20"" wide overall and 18"" drawer interior;Stated Depth: 17"" Deep, was actually 19"" deep overall and 16"" drawer interior.This may not have caused problems with a large desk, but I chose this unit based on stated dimensions. Now I must modify the table somehow, making it asthetically unappealing, or go through the expense and hassle of returning the drawer and looking for a replacement.Drawer also very flimsy; as I held it by one edge (to pull out of carton), I could see it bend slightly.For the price, it should have been made to specifications stated, and of better quality."
5,Such a good CD for a single...,"This is by far the best Chemical single. ""Elektrobank"" is an amazing track. ""Not Another Drugstore"" is probably my favorite Chemical creation. I can't believe it didn't make ""DYOH"". The Dust Bros. remix is a great sample track. Every track has wigged-out guitars and fat bass. How could you resist buying it?"
4,Worth the buy,This is one of the first Chem. Bros. CDs I bought and it led me to buy about 7 more. Elektrobank is a very technical complex well done song and the Dust Bros. Remix is awesome too. Not another Drugstore has some good freestyling action. The rest are so-so. That's about it!
2,No visible results,"I have used this product for only two weeks but I expected more. I like the light weight texture and the way it completely disappears into the skin without leaving any greasiness. However, I am yet to see the results promised but I have not used the product for up to 30days. I will continue to use it for the next 4weeks and hopefully I'll get some results"
2,Product not as advertised,"This paper was listed as 210gm--quite thick paper, usable for postcards. What was sent was 150gm--very thin. The print quality is not bad. Ok for DVD case covers."
2,Strollertime,Walking CD is mostly music with a woman repeating safty instructionsVideo is not working out with baby in arms but shows pictures on TV that are supposed to keep baby happy. I do not want to see women who are suppose to be moms with perfect abs work out!
4,BRILLIANT AND HILARIOUS LOVECRAFT SPOOF,"Whether you are an ""in the closet/out of the closet"" Occultist, you'll love this film spoof of the occult in general, and HP Lovecraft in particular. The scene where Fred Ward has a conversation with a real estate agent who praises the fact that her homes are made with ""the finest Thaumaturgy"" and builder zombies falling in the background will split your gut...no pun intended. Anyone will enjoy this film; but Occultists will howl. Plus, Old Cthulhu never looked so good..."
4,Marvelous Mystic Film Noir,"This is definitely a parody of both the paranormal genre and classic hardboiled detectives, but it is done with tremendous style and grace. From the landlady who puts a spell on the cards she gives Fred Ward so they always come up first when he reaches for one of his own to the casual assumption that everyone in Hollywood uses magic, this an entertaining film worth seeing if you catch it on TV.It'd be better if the geniuses at HBO would release it on DVD because I'd snatch it up in a minute."
4,"Cast a Deadly DvD, please","A made for HBO tribute to 40's pulp fiction and Lovecraft's mythos, this Detective Lovecraft , like the protagonist in Hammett's Maltese Falcon, is looking for an 'item' the Lovecraftian twist here has that item being the Necronomicon. The story is set in a Chicago of the 40's in which magic and the conveniences of the period are merged, everyone uses magic, except Phillip Lovecraft. I gotta think that Jim Butcher was inspired to create Harry Dresden after seeing this, although Dresden is less reluctant to work magic.Hope this comes to DvD soon, the sequel as well, a recast WitchHunt, with Hopper as Lovecraft."
2,espanol version,"as far as the shipping,ok,but the movie was in spanish.you cant win them allthe tape seemed to play ok,just couldnt understand it."
4,Love this kit,"I am a beginner cake decorator and I purchased this kit to save some money, also as a way to keep everything neat and in one spot. I really enjoy this kit. I only wish the bottom compartment was bigger to carry things like an apron and such. Definitely a must if you want to start decorating and dont know how to start. The bigger kits have much more stuff in it, and I wish I had got one of them, but this is the cheapest and prettiest colored box in my opinion."
3,Big Box with little content,"The product is accurately represented on the website, so this should not be a big surprise. I find it however overpriced, since it is mostly a big box with a few plastic pieces inside."
5,Love It!,This is the perfect way to start with a decorating kit or to give someone as a gift. It comes with everything a beginner needs as well as plenty of space for more items as they purchase them. I love having all my decorating items all together in one place!
5,Keeping It Together,"This is the best value for your money! It's great for keeping it all together, especially when decorating on the go. I love the pegs for organizing your decorating tips & there's plenty of room under the tray for everything you need to make the cake (except the pans!) I definately recommend it."
4,A gift for a happy little baker,"I bought this kit for my God daughter, who is 16 years old, for Christmas.She loves baking and decorating and she listed a few items on her Christmas list.I was looking at this same kit at Joann's and Michael's and was going to pick it up and have it shipped, since I live out of state. But one day I was browsing through the Amazon website and saw this item. You can imagine how happy I was not only could I have it shipped directly from Amazon it was also less expensive!!She called me on Christmas Day and was so excited and started using her kit the very next day.. it had everything she needed to start right away and to learn new decorating methods.. Nice to know that even at teenagers you can still make them happy with a gift that can include others..It was great!"
4,Everything you need,"I bought this for my daughter, she makes cupcakes for her music recitals. She loved it so much I bought it for my daughter-in law who make my grandsons birthday cakes every year. She said it had everything she'd ever need.Thomas the train ,Elmo, Mickey mouse, watch out , here she comes."
3,"Henryk Mikolaj Górecki: Already It Is Dusk (String Quartet No. 1, Op. 62) (1988) / ""Lerchenmusik"" Recitatives & Ariosos, Op. 53,","Henryk Mikolaj Górecki: Already It Is Dusk (String Quartet No. 1, Op. 62) (1988) / ""Lerchenmusik"" Recitatives & Ariosos, Op. 53, for Clarinet, Cello & Piano (1984) - Kronos Quartet / London Sinfonietta Solois is a 1991 Elektra recording starring the Kronos Quartet on the first piece and then one gets to hear the London Sinfonietta Soloists, i.e., Michael Colins, clarinet, Christopher Van Kampen on the cello and pianist John Constable. The first piece I really do not like as it sounds like more noise then anything else. Lerchenmusik is better and is more traditional. Recommended for fans of modern classical music otherwise avoid it. 3/5."
2,Oblomov,"OblomovAfter reading the book of Gontcharov, this film just feels so wrong and with no depht in the caracters, Olga seems a silly girl when the lovestory between her and Stoltz is not told, Stoltz appears too arrogant in that version of the story, all the strength of Gontcharov's language is missing in this film-adaptation! The actor of Oblomov is fantastic, but his caracter misses all the sadness of his downfall when the lovestory to his housekeeper is not told - so just never miss the real story, read the book!!!"
3,Sad,"I have been waiting for months for the release of Enigma 6. Today is a disappointing day. When I heard that the album's title translation meant ""Retrospective or analyze past experiences"", I was prepared for this album to rekindle the magic of the early albums and blow me away. sadly, I wasn't blown away and I found myself moving forward through tracks without finishing the previous to see if any of the songs grabbed me. I love the female vocals in the previous albums, and they are sorely missed here. Most of the tracks are repetitive and sound alike. Once the song starts, that is pretty much what you get. With the exception of ""Goodbye Milkyway"" there are no standout tracks here. I am going to give it a few more listens and see if I don't warm up to it as I did with ""Voyageur"", but without any of the magic in previous songs like ""Return To Innocence, I Love You I'll Kill You, Gravity Of Love"" I am afraid this album may indeed take 6th place."
4,Great cd,"This is a great cd. I'll admit I do like Enigma's older stuff better, but this cd is better than Voyageur. There isn't much singing on this cd, unlike some of the other ones, but the music is pretty good. I'd recommend this album"
5,*_ENIGMA,"Yet another journey from the enigma himself. Like every album, this one is unique and has a mind of it's own with of course the enigmatic flair. I can vividly imagine the celestial images when hearing it, and loving the layered and airy feel I constantly have it on replay. My favorite songs are; Eppur Si Muove, Feel Me Heaven, Dancing With Mephisto, Invisible Love, 20,000 Miles Over the Sea, Sitting on the Moon & Goodbye Milky Way. I gave this album 5 stars because of this man's incredible talent! He deserves it. Enigma has been my favorite since they started, because he gave me something to believe in."
3,Further Along The Path Of Voyageur,"I feel this album continues further along the path started with Voyageur. Too much electronica, not enough ppl. I wasn't happy with Voyageur on the whole, although it had high points, and I am even less happy with this album, although if I were assessing it as electronica, and not from an Enigma MCMXC a.d.-fan point of view, it would perhaps get 4 stars. I would say i quite liked Goodbye Milky Way, Dreaming of Andromeda, and Eppur Si Muove/Feel Me Heaven. If only Enigma would backtrack, at least as far back as Le Roi Est Mort...Vive Le Roi if not further, to give this fan a taste of the classic..."
1,LUKEWARM,A disappointing CD for an Enigma fan since the start. I miss the sensual sound that I've come to expect from Enigma...bring back the good stuff!
1,This is really the end for me.,"I really, really love Enigma's first CD. The second wasn't as great but it wasn't bad either. The third was actually good for it's own reasons. The fourth was remicient of the first and was therefore OK. The fifth was marginally good, in that it took time for most of the songs to be interesting to me. The sixth, and their latest, has finally just uninteresting to me. I don't devalue it as I could grow to like some of the tracks but for the most part I'm unimpressed. In fact, the only song that grabbed me was the Alchemist. And even at that I wasn't all that grabbed. I would recommend those that have listened to Enigma over time to listen first to the CD and then decide if this would be better downloaded as individual tracks instead of a full CD."
4,Give It a Chance,"While not the best Enigma album ever, it certainly grows on you after repeated listening so give it a chance. Two of the best tracks are ""Sitting on the Moon"" and ""Milky Way"". I would definitely purchase it again."
2,This is not the best CD,"Enigma always was enigma bcause of this samples enigmatics ,gregorians ,africans voices ,thats why enigma was good ,this is not enigma music this is eurodance or trance or what ever and enigma is not the king in this type of music ,so I dont think this is a good Enigma's CD ,I think this is a little better than Voyageur CD ,but is not enigma anymore .the must beautiful song is Goodbye Milky way .. the music is not bad at all ,but it is not enigma's music .this is a different thing."
3,Defective product,The product was defective because track 11 in the cd doesn't play properly. I am very disappointed with the quality of the cd.
4,"good, but not spectacular","This is yet another offering in the caliber you would expect Enigma to produce. it is good. Very good in fact, but I find it lacking in originality. It is predictable and comfortable for fans who want more of the same, but seems to have fallen into that programmed numbness in some places. Enigma has stopped experimenting and settled into the tried and true. So if you are looking for more of the same and love that, this is a great choice. If you are looking for new directions in creativity from Enigma, you won't get it. It is a good album."
1,A journey through the Galaxy?,"2006 ""A posteriori"" - oh dear. That was huge disappointment. That supposed to be a concept album that describes a journey through the Galaxy. The problem is that album is monotonic and boring, production so poor and all songs sound very similar to each other. Two singles were released. Terrible ""Goodbye Milky Way"" with horrible sampled voice that sounds like murdered cat was released to promote the album. Few months before Enigma released ""Hello and welcome"" that was promoting ""LSD"" compilation but is included on ""A posteriori"" as well. Single version of that song is rather typical pop-rock song but on the EP there is very good remix ""After The Storm Mix"" and album contains a bit modified version of this mix. Another quite good standalone track is ""Sitting On The Moon"" with interesting nostalgic lyrics but very simple and basic arrangament."
4,pleasantness,"There are no outstanding tracks on this disc, but with Enigma the project is to be listened as a whole rather than for individual tracks. Some Enigma tracks like Following the Sun and Cross of Changes in previous Enigma albums have that individual personality, but lack their true purpose outside of the disc. Goodbye Milky Way comes close to such an individual track identity, but like I stated, there are no outstanding tracks here. The disc however as a whole follows the splendor, passion and sensation of music in the first four projects. From the moment I put in the CD until the end, I was caught in the trance and ambiance of Enigma that is so enjoyable. I stress to people wanting to listen to Enigma to not look for the popular track but to experience the music as a whole. Plan to give yourself time to relax and to simply enjoy this."
5,Anything Enigma Anytime,"I'm going to tell you up front -- I'm a big fan of Enigma. Have been since ""MXMXC a.D."" and have all their albums. To me, even repetitive Enigma -- like ""Goodbye Milky Way"" -- is better than most other musicians' work. I especially like ""Dreaming of Andromeda"" on this disk. And, as usual, their mix and song sequence is impeccable.My one complaint is their albums are too short. I could easily live with them being twice as long...but then again, that might defeat the beauty of them.But like I said -- I'm already a huge fan."
4,Enigma's comeback,"1st album of Enigma was a masterpiece. Second was not as good, but great. The rest were not worth listening to (in my opinion). After about 15 years of producing, frankly, junk Cretu is back with a new album I enjoy and listen to a lot. It is not the classic Enigma - this horse has been beaten to death already - but rather a new, more electronic direction with some Enigma sounds and hints. I think this is the right direction for Cretu - there simply will never be another ""MCMXC A.D."". This album proves that he does not need another ""MCMXC A.D."" to give his fans wonderful music to listen to. Cretu should go and explore new worlds - we all know he can!"
4,Are we listening to the same CD?,"I think this is a great CD, even the first listen. After the first song and the Enigma signature riff, this takes you on what I call the Enigma Journey. Sorry folks,I don't think you and I listened to the same CD. These tracks were well done and I love this CD."
3,In agreement with R O C K E T (above review)...,"Just a quick review to concurr with ROCKET's review somewhere above... I listenend to this album for the first time in my car on a long road trip. Was really dissapointed, thought it alittle shallow in sound, etc. I then got home and put it on a decent soundsystem and it was almost like listening to a different album. There is a lot of subtle mixing here that really lifts the whole thing. Last track is a bit cheesy though..."
5,"New album, new sound","Like some other reviewers, the more I listen to this CD the more I like it. I found it to be a good CD to listen to for relaxation and exercising the imagination. Few tracks are memorable, but I felt it was all worth it for Goodbye Milky Way and Sitting on the Moon. I really like how Enigma creates a different sound and mood for each of their albums. I know of some music artists who never do that, and each album they come out with is predictable and the same. With Enigma, I always look forward to their releases because I know they'll have some new surprises."
4,Give it Time,"I completely agree with ROCKET's review. At first I said, ""ehh, its OK."" But as I listened again and again, with a good sound system, I was addicted. I still feel its not as good as their first four albums--with their mysterious ethnic chants and haunting sounds--but definitely better than their last."
3,ENIGMA CHILLED,"AS AN ENIGMA FAN WAITING FOR THE NEXT CD, THIS NEW RELEASE WAS DISAPPOINTING WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO IT, EXPECTING MAYBE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. BUT AFTER CONTINUED PLAYING IT STARTS TO GROW ON YOU AND YOU REALIZE THAT THIS CD IS A PERFECT MELLOW MOOD ENIGMA SOUND THAT IS RIGHT THERE WITH THE REST OF THEM. IT IS LAID BACK AND GREAT CHILL MUSIC WITH AN ENIGMA TWIST. RECOMMENDED FOR ANY ENIGMA FAN."
4,"Only Reviewing ""The Plague of the Zombies""","I haven't been able to see ""The Mummy's Shroud"" but I have seen ""The Plague of the Zombies."" It is an innovative and entertaining zombie film. A series of mysterious deaths and some strange activities in the old abandoned mines outside of town are all tied together in an insidious plot. Can the hero save the town and his headstrong daughter?Fans of ""The Evil Dead"" movies will notice some shots that seem very familiar as the dead rise from their graves."
4,Zombies Hammer-style,"Fete of DeathWhen I ordered this movie a few days ago I didn't realize I had already seen it. The title ""Plague of the Zombies"" didn't ring any bells. After the fox hunters kidnaped Andre Morell's daughter, though, I remembered that I had already seen it.This is an excellent Hammer horror movie that few people have ever heard of. I don't why the movie gets so little exposure. It's right up there with the best of Hammer's horror flicks. It has a great gothic ambience, a tight story line, smart direction, and a skillful cast. The zombies may seem cheesy by today's standards, but they still spooked me. If you like horror movies, don't miss this one. There isn't much blood and gore, but if ""Plague of the Zombies"" proves anything, it's that you don't need them to serve up the chills.--Bryan Cassiday"
3,"Three interesting version of the classic Mummy tale, from Hammer films.","The Mummy's Shroud is the third and last of Hammer's Mummy films.The first was an almost verbatemum remake of the Boris Karloff classicThe Mummy,(1959) done by Universal Pictures,starring Christopher Lee.Not stopping there, the seconed film was entitled Curse of the Mummy'sTomb(1965). Followed by Shroud two years later.While the first film is the best. the following two are also worth seeing.Especially since the second film ""Curse"" is unavailable in the US. exceptas an import. for which you must have a region free dvd player in order toview it.Perhaps Ancor Bay and Hammer Film, will release all three films as a set.Just as Universal did with it Fly films."
4,creepy and horrific,"I have to say, this movie is pretty scarie for 1967! I've seen alot of horror movies, and I find this to be the scarest!!I don't recomend this movie for kids under 7 years old.The best part in the movie is when in the end when the mummy comes after Claire {Maggie Kimberly} but of course the hero {David Buick} comes to rescue her. The music in this movie really gets you into the horror mood when Sir Basil {Andre Morrell} is murdered by the mummy when he's in the gypsy's tent.This is really spooky!!! I feel sorry for one of the expiditioners who was murdered by the mummy in his hotel room. He is so fat and chubby and that's why I like him. Alot of people die in this movie because of the mummy's curse. The only reason why all of them die is because, they distrubed the spirit of the tomb. I feel this is a great movie with good music and acting."
3,Slow As A Mummy,"I love Hammer Films. Needed to round out my collection of the Hammer Mummy films and eagerly got this one. Though the atmosphere, sets, and decor is filmed beautifully, the story itself is a little lacking. The scare factor isn't very high, and the pace of the film is boringly slow. Probably the worst of the Hammer Mummy entries, but still worth having."
4,Very cute for sandwiches,"My daughter had a butterfly princess birthday party, and this was perfect for cutting the sandwiches for the kids. It's just the right size for standard slices of bread. We have used it for cookies as well - it's a great cutter. I would only share that for sandwiches, I would recommend making them and THEN cutting rather than trying to cut out individual bread slices and then assemble the sandwich. We made PB&J for all of the girls. The ones where I tried to cut the bread and then assemble it were very messy and didn't look as cute. When I made the PB&J on regular bread and then cut out the butterflies, they were trouble free, quick and easy to do."
2,"good product & price, hairy service","Received the product today after 10 days of waiting. I don't know where they are stored, but the rubbery grip on all 3 pieces was covered in animal hair, both straight and wavy! This is a health hazard for families with allergies. Luckily, we don't, so I just wiped them off and will keep them. I'll pour some boiling water on them before use though, as this sounds gross to me."
5,A Winner!,"Finally a book bold enough to recognize that attention to spirit is a vital ingredient in an effective coaching partnership. Reframes the use of intuition and rapport into a larger holistic framework. Surprisingly concrete, not airy fairy. Directly applicable to executive, business and personal coaching. Thought provoking, yet practical, takes coaching literature to a new level. I found myself planning ways I would coach differently as I read it. A great addition to my coaching library."
2,Where did your spiritual base go?,"I picked up this book hoping to find a resource to assist me in helping others. I wasn't able to finish the book, perhaps because I understand spirituality at a deeper level than the author appears to have ever been. It is interesting to notice the author's mean spirited response to the sole critical review of her work. Perhaps Cathy is the only person who doesn't personally know the author to put in a review. A spiritually based person would not respond to a critical review in such a narrow minded way. She even attacked the person's character because of misspellings. Where did your spiritual base go?"
3,Engrossing account of early Cold war shenanigans,"""Mole"" was on the reading list for CIA applicants,* so i found it in the library & was hooked from page one. It is the account of the first Soviet agent to be turned by the CIA. It is the tale of a man in a perpetual state of fear & panic.But if that's not satisfactory, there's the digressive account of the original model for James Bond: a Yugoslav by birth, assigned to spy on the Abwehr by the Soviets. In 1941, he arrives in America. His connection with Pearl Harbor & J. Edgar Hoover may leave you, like me, baffled forever: ""How could they not know?A book that unusual for the fact that it wasn't written to capitalize on current events. A very good account of the early post-WWII days in the espionage game.*I didn't get the job."
5,Very Helpful Book on DNA and Genes,This is a great book for simple explinations of a difficult subject. It will be assist my ESOL students greatly because of its readability and graphics.
3,"kind of strange, not too bad","endo was first introduced to me thru the dracula 2k soundtrack with the song ""malice"".the song was subpar, but i figured they would be worth a shot.the first few cuts, ""leave us alone"" and ""penicillin"" are good,really heavy and groove heavy rock songs.""suffer"" was the singel released and wasnt that bad.""beat around the bush"" is my eprsonal favorite.the snare drum just sounds so good in the song, witht he audible overtones and such.this album is about average numetal, when it was just starting to rise as a massive genre it is today.if you are looking for something new, give it a try.their sophomore cd ""songs fo the restless"" is a complete 180 from this one, so give that disc a try also."
3,Good rocken CD,"This is a decent CD... In all the [stuff] that is out there this isnt half bad... along the lines of Drowning Pool with a little hint of Pantera and Manson!!! Has Nu-Metal tendicies but they are acceptable in my opinion, Check it out used, or listen to sound clips and decide for yourself I know I like it!!!"
1,garbage...,"I heard ""leave us alone"" and decided to give these guys a try..I have to say that none of the songs are as good as that and it just left with with a rancid weak-new-metal taste in my mouth...."
2,Songs For The Restless Is Way Better,"This is the album that makes them sound like they really need to mature. In SFTR, gone is the wierd, industrial-like sound bits that make this one hard to listen to. Anyway, a couple of standout tracks. (Leave Us Alone, Malice, Beat Around The Bust) The rest is pretty much garbage. Every cd follows a pattern. This is the ""We have a few good songs but we really need to mature"" cd. Songs For The Restless is the ""I can listen to every song on this"" type cd. We all know which one is better. SFTR!!!"
3,CD does not match written music,"I just received this book of Dykes music and the accompaning CD. Dykes is obviously awesome, and I realize I can't play like him with any amount of work. But I bought the book to try and learn a bit of his technique. I assumed the CD that came with it would be him playing the songs in the book, so I could listen to how it is SUPPOSED to sound. The stuff on the CD is great but only 1 cut corresponds to what the book charts.Wouldn't one assume that an instructional book that comes with a CD would have the same music on both, so you could learn??So I am slightly miffed, but as I say the stuff on the CD is great.I just say, if you are going to sell a book of music with a CD, make the CD match the sheet music/tablature."
3,PHP4 Web Development Solutions,"I highly recommend that prior to buying this book, you go to the Wrox web site ... to preview the sample chapter. I found that I simply did not like the style of the book. It's ""dive-right-in"" approach of giving you a bunch of case studies, where each chapter outlines their approach to a particular problem, complete with source code, but with little explanation of techniques. You must register your book before you can download the source to the example code from the Wrox site. I also didn't like the heavy use of the Smarty template engine either. Simply put, I prefer the incremental approach like that of found in other books like ""Web Database Applications with PHP & MySQL"", by David Lane and Hugh Williams."
3,"Good, if its what you want...","Before buying this, you should have a SOLID grounding in the theory and practice of php. This book does offer solutions, even ones that seem elegant.BUT, it never really stops to explain the actual coding. It takes time to explain only the approach they take to the problem and the rationale for their approach. It assumes you understand the code and moves right along. You will not find ANY hand-holding here.Moreover, of the solutions presented, at least two use XML. So, you might also want to have some xml skills on hand, if you are to make use of a significant part of this book.Once again, the book seems good and you can learn from it. But, understand that you need a solid php foundation to effectively use this book."
4,Powerful Modern Music,"This is powerful music. Though it is modern music, I think it will find a large audience of classical music and beyond. The theme is very sad throughout and reminds me of Wagner, Shostokovitch and Mahler. There are a couple of times when the music is quiet and suddently startles with it's intensity. The recording is good."
2,Be Careful,"After listening to this, I couldn't help but think: ""is the musical-cultural landscape so grey and indistinguisable that we award the award-winners because they already have awards?"" I'm no dog, but I can smell the cat-dookie in the flowerbed. If I wanted the same ""slick"" orchestrations and ""orgasmic"" percussive explosions, I'll watch the Grammy's; at least I will have some poorly-executed jokes to poke fun at.Once, at a party with classical composers and performers, I put this disc in the stereo in order to drive people outside so I could more easily bum a smoke. It worked.I'm just saying: be critical. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before and done better.Maybe I'm wrong, but I heard that Mozart farted symphonies in his sleep."
4,excellent catchy music,i enjoyed all the songs but especially i can feel you in my heart . area 54 is different but erry. i reccommend this cd to anyone
4,Michael Poss' Thirtysomething Pop Appeal,"""One thing I really like about Michael's songs is that, for the most part, he has done away with pronouns. So when he sings ""...just let me give you all the love you need..."", the listener, male or female, can take the words personally. His messages are also simple yet profound, speaking to those who push for equality and justice..."""
4,Fast setup!,This sure beats the hassle of installing a NIC card if you have USB. Directions are well written and easy to follow. Works great. (Don't forget to order a LAN cable if you don't have one).
2,Disappointing,"I normally enjoy Bradshaw's work. But ""Alchemy of Fire""was simply a re-tread of ""The Sand Reckoner"" which wasa far superior book. You are better off reading ""The Sand Reckoner"" and skipping ""Alchemy of Fire"" altogether."
1,Coin sorter,I returned this item immediately after the first try -- The coins jumped right back out of the machine instead of going into the wrappers.
4,Works like a charm,"So far so good with this coin sorter. Turning the handle does not bother me, it sorts the coins easily. Sometimes you get one stuck, so it you then need to reverse. But this is true with most coin sorters, it's never going to be 100% flawless. You feed the coins from the top and turn the handle. The coins get sorted into the paper wrappers and you're good to go. I recommend this if you don't mind a manual coin sorter."
5,"Works great, no complaints!",I'll never go motorized after using this. Especially for the price. This works great!
3,"works most of the time, but not really accurate","This product works most of the time, but there are some small problems:1. If your coin wrap (paper cone) go over the top a little bit, the coins sometimes won't go into the wrap correctly.2. If you put a lot of same type of coins to the sorter (e.g. lots of ""quarters""), some coins might actually get stuck in the sorter.3. When coins got stuck inside of the machine, it might be very difficult to get them out.Overall it works like 80% of the time."
4,forward to the past,I like this item as a return to the good ol days of using manual power. Only draw-back is sometimes the coins overshoot their holders. That may be a function of how fast I turn the handle?
4,Nice coin sorter,"I had tons of coins built up in my office. I had experience with the battery op type and wasn't satisfied. I came across this manual crank sorter, so I gave it a shot. It takes big piles of coins and sorts them with 98% accuracy. There are some overshoots and mistaken slots occasionally, but overall, a very good machine. If there's a jam, you can reverse a bit, unclog the jam, and continue. I recommend this sorter for a stockpile of coins of home requiring some organization."
1,Does not sort pennies or dimes worth a damn,"THis item will sort quarters nickles and dimes just ""OK"" If you have pennies they end up in the nickle slot. The dimes end up in the penney slot quite a bit. I have to keep out the pennies and keep transfering dimes from the penney slot to the dime slot. Quarters work well but would not purchase this item again."
4,Fits the bill,"So I bought this over the other coin sorters because this one is manual.It jams pretty easily, but gets unjammed just as easily - more annoying than anything else.Please note that this is only a coin SORTER, not a coin counter. I guess when the tubes are filled, that is when you're supposed to know that you've reached the face-value on the roll. But you actually have to count it to verify.If I had it over, I'd probably purchase a coin sorter and counter. But I can't give this item < 4 stars since I wasn't thinking straight. It does exactly as it advertises."
4,Royal Sovereign works,Good product and does the job. It does have a problem when the wrappers are in thetubes. It under counts when the wrappers are inserted in tubes. Works perfectly when used without the wrappers and then insert the wrapper. Wrapper slips right on.
3,"Royal Sovereign Sort 'N Save Manual Coin Sorter, Clear (MS-1)",This coin sorter is ok at best. The only drawback is the length of the coin tubes. It is hard to tell if you have the right amount of coins after if fills. One or two of the tubes must add a coin to transfer the right amount to the paper coin tubes. The crank feature is fine. You don't have to worry about batteries.
5,Better than the reviews,"I just used this coin sorter for the first time. I sorted and rolled $138.00 worth of silver in under half an hour. I don't know how long it would have taken me to do it by hand, but much, much longer than that. It only took that long because I checked the first roll of each type of coin to make sure the correct number of coins was in the wrapper. All were fine. I have had two battery operated sorters and neither one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one. When they jammed, fixing the jam was time consuming and difficult. This crank sorter is an easy fix to unjam. And if you find your pace and the right number of coins to put in the hopper, it rarely jams. Now on to my other three juice jars full of silver. I will have amassed several hundred dollars in rolled coins by the end of the day!"
4,Very Good,"This worked great for me. I unscrewed the 3 screws that keep the housing on so I could clear jams easy. In $80 worth of change i had about 3 jams (jams were due to foreign coins and debris). Slow and steady is the key.Hand counted each sleeve of coin then weighed them on my postage scale. 2 of the sleeves (I think nickels and dimes, I don't remember and its already packed away) you are better off not inserting the preformed coin sleeve and just waiting until the coins are flush with the tube. Other than than it took about 15 min to count $80 with of coins. It could have been less time but I did a lot of double checking to verify accurate counts. It was fun. It would have gotten 5 stars if it was 100% accurate at counting. For $30 you cant go wrong."
5,Royal Sovereign Sort 'N Save Manual Coin Sorte,Great little product. No batteries or AC plufg; just a crank handle. Works just fine.
1,not all that good,"The product is cheap! I think that the cheap plastic gears should be metal. The machine doesn't count the coins wich i am not angry about, but the coins could be too low or too much. It is not really fast. I think that the product needs improvments."
2,Tubes not so great,"A couple minutes after opening I decided to put the sorter to use. It jams every so often if you try to load a bunch of coins in it or go too fast. You have to seem to load an extra coin in yourself to make the tubes have the correct amount of money in them, the top always seems to be a coin short. Ive had a couple pennies fall into the dime tube out of about half a mug of coins."
3,On the cheap side,Hit and miss if the coin goes in the wrapper or falls out in the front of sorter.Good macine for the $$$
4,Not Bad For The Price,"This coin sorter is not bad for $31.00. I sorted out about $300.00 worth of change in about 1.5 hours. I did not experience the problems other buyers did. I left the coin wrappers in the tubes, loaded the hopper with coins and cranked the handle. When a tube filled up I replaced it and kept cranking until I needed to replace another. The hopper will become jammed from time to time, but it is nothing to worry about. Just turn the crank in the opposite direction a little and it will clear the jam. I think it was the dimes that caused the most jams, but again it was nothing that caused me any real trouble. Accuracey was also very good. A couple of pennies ended up in the nickel tube and a couple of dimes in the penny tube. I think it was well worth the $31.00 and it will last me a long time."
5,great time and money saver,"I got this machine for my team for tip distribution. They used to go to coin star, which was eating up a good portion of their tip pool. Now the only expense is the coin rollers (must buy pre-formed ones,not the flat ones that can be obtained from any bank for free). This machine does not require batteries - another plus. You will also quickly figure out not to put too many coins at once. Have fun :)"
4,Good basic coin sorter,"If you are looking for a manual coin sorter, this is a good one. I was eager to use this when I received. I poured my coins in (all silver) and began to crank the handle. I quickly noticed I put in too many coins so I removed some. Works pretty good once you learn how many coins to put in and how to turn. I turned it medium speed and occasionally it would jam. I just reversed the handle a little and that usually solved the problem. The other problem I had was determining when a wrappper was full. Dimes were the hardest, but once you do several times you can tell. Overall, I recommend this sorter, just be gentle with it."
4,Royal Sovereign,So far so good. Happy to have an change counter that doesn't rely on batteries. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is it's plastic construction (will it hold up over time) and I wish the system could be designed to stop when a tube reaches a full coin count. Sometimes I find myself counting the coins in each tube to verify the count is correct but not having to separate by hand is truly the purpose of this purchase and so far it has been excellent.
4,Home Coin Sorter,"The Sort N Save home coin sorter works pretty good. It comes assembled, just add the handle. Its not as accurate as I hoped but it sorts pretty good. Sometimes the quarters jump out. I would recommend this product."
2,Lasted for US$780 of Coins,"This product started out strong, then turned into junk. It is suitable only for light-duty, occasional use only.First, it does not load 'after-market' paper sleeves. Once the paper sleeves its delivered with are full, it will never smoothly fill the tubes again.I found the counts to be off by one coin. I always had to add a quarter, nickel, or dime to make a full roll after the coins started sliding off the tubes.After sorting about US$600 of change, it started jamming. I had to disassemble it more then once to clear coins out of the machine. Once the jamming started, the jams became more frequent. Eventually, the crank started skipping. The jamming apparently caused the plastic gears to become stripped.Now, the crank spins and spins. When it 'catches' about every tenth crank, it works fine. I had to trash the machine, cause 'I was just spinning my wheels'.This product is worth about US$15 only. It not worth any more."
3,Just OK - you get what you pay for,"Not a bad machine, but not the best. Coins like to fall to the side when sorting. If you go slow enough it's a bit better. The bigger problem is that they don't fill the wrappers enough - and I'm always wondering if I filled them with the correct amount of coins. Kind of annoying..."
1,A Child's Toy,"This product was poorly designed. The quarters and nickels sort fine, but the dimes frequently sort into the penny slot and at times the pennies sort into the nickel slot. The pennies and dimes overshot their respective slots at least 50% of the time no matter how slowly the user turns the crank.Also, this product should be re-categorized in the children's toy section. It is not sophisticated enough for an adult. I purchased this item as a present for my husband, it was a little embarrassing to see a picture of a 5-year-old on the box as if this item was designed for children. This sorter is cheaply constructed and has childish colors."
1,works well but toxic,"I bought this Manual Coin Sorter, and it works extremely well. But, the plastic material that it is manufactured with gives off a harsh, choking, and toxic plastic smell. I could almost see the fumes coming from this material (made in china). The chemical smell fills the entire room. I was impelled to donate this piece of junk to GoodWill because of the headache causing odors. Kiss my purchase price goodbye! Skip this and do your mind and body a favor. --evil smell in Portland"
1,Totally inaccurate piece of crap,"The coin stacks on this sorter are consistently 1-3 coins short, no matter how tightly the coins are packed into the wrappers, so unless you're prepared to count as the coins go in (and really, that's the point of buying a sorter, isn't it? So you don't have to count?), you're going to come up several dollars short across a couple hundred dollars worth of assorted wrapped coins. Don't waste your money."
5,Works Great!,This product works great! I bought coin rolls from Walmart that fit the tubs and they work great too. It does not jam very much and is very easy to use. We rolled about $200 dollars worth of coins in an hour. I recommend this!
2,Patience Paitience!,"You get what you pay for. This device sorts the coins in the proper tube, that is, the coins that don't miss the tubes. Roughly one third do not make it to the designated coin tubes, falling out beneath the device. You just scoop them up and toss them back in the chute."
4,good for the money. :),"Good value for the price, tends to jamb and spit coins out the front, a 1/4"" shim under the front feet seems to cure that, tends to short count, check before you wrap."
2,Disappointed,"I searched for a coin sorter with decent reviews, and thought I had made a good choice. I boxed it back up the same day I got it for return because it did not accurately sort the coins. IThe other problem I found is, even with filling to the brim of the individual coin areas, they were about 3 coins short on every roll. I used this properly and it did not do what it says it does. If your bank doesn't care about short stacks or wrong coins in the stacks, you may not mind. My bank is not so easy-going. From now on I'll use CoinStar and get an Amazon certificate."
3,Not very accurate,It's usually not accurate but it is good for my husband and I to save our change instead of on top of the counter.
4,Nice coin sorter,Our old battery operated coin sorter finally died and it never worked that great. I decided to buy one that didn't take batteries and this does the job well. You can see if any coins get stuck and no more batteries! Just don't put too many coins in the top at one time or they may get stuck. Give the job to the kids and it keeps them occupied.
4,Good Bang for your Buck,"Perfect for home use. Since it is hand cranked you have more control. When it jams; it's easy to back off so, it won't slow you down too much. I recommend this over a cheap electric counter. Either get an expensive counter or go with a hand crank counter. As a hand crank counter I found this one to be well made and fun to use. Kind of addicting. When I get the right coin mixture and it is working nice and smooth; it can be kind of hypnotic. Anyways, hope that helps.Oh, we also recommend getting a device that closes the ends of your coin tubes like the bank does. We found one that does it by hand."
2,It can get annoying.,"Changed my mind. What an utter annoyance. I had to continuously dump out the coin tubes to get at the pennies and dimes that were sorted inaccurately. I had to turn the crank so slow it was not worth the hassle. I wound up, after 5 hours of use, manually sorting the coins and then having to count the tubes to verify they contained the accurate number of coins. For all that hassle, I can save myself $30 and just do it by hand anyways. Returned the item. Perhaps it is okay as a kid's toy, but not for anyone who seriously is looking for a time saver."
4,Quick Delivery,Got to my house within a couple days. Coins dont always fall into the roll but it works. I got this to sort coins for my cash drawer at my retail store. Wouldnt have a use for it otherwise.
1,Not worth the money or the trouble - just go to the bank!,"I read the product reviews before purchasing this sorter...but, I'm wondering if the reviews I read are for the same product (MS1-Manual Coin Sorter, 1-Row, 7-19/64""x9-7/64""x8-19/64, Blue). I do not recommend this sorter (MS-1) as it is not worth the money or trouble!This sorter is too inaccurate for any use; it routinely sorted coins into the wrong slots (pennies in the nickel slot, dimes in with the quarters, etc) and is virtually always over or short in each coin row which, in my opinion, is not acceptable even for a kid or weekend yard-seller. What's the point of inaccurately sorting coins?Furthermore, the coins consistently overshoot the chutes and fall on the table or floor....really a pain! I should have returned it and suggest you spend your money on something fun or useful."
1,inaccurate and inconsistent,"I don't have that much change, so I thought a hand-crank coin sorter would work well for me as opposed to an automatic counter/sorter. I put over $40 of change through this product and had an absolutely terrible time with it. It did not put an accurate OR consistent amount of coins in the wrappers. I found myself counting each roll of change, some were off by a coin or two... some were off by as much as eight coins. At the end of the day, I'd rather spend a little more up front and not worry about double checking each roll of coins."
2,Great idea - but inaccurate counting,"This is a really cool idea and works very smoothly. My kids had a blast sorting all their change.The real problem is that when I double-checked a few rolls, the count was short by one or two coins in each roll. This was using the manufacturers own paper rolls. I ended up not putting the rolls in the plastic tubes before sorting and instead transfering the coins into the rolls after they were sorted into the plastic tubes. I had to note for each coin, the fill point for each tube to get accurate results.I could get around this problem, but for the money, it should provide an accurate count.One other note - if you turn the handle the wrong way (counterclockwise) the coins go into the wrong slot. Must be turned clockwise to get everything to go into the right slot. Not a big deal, but I noticed this was a common complaint. Unlike the inaccuracy, the sorting problem is easily avoided."
4,A Good Manual Coin Sorter With Some Minor Mods,"The Royal Sovereign manual coin sorter is a good product. I bought one back in Jan 2008, so I've been using it for 7 months now. Occasional, it will drop a dime into the penny column (2 occurrences after sorting $200 worth of coins). Also, when I first used it, it was obvious I needed to modify the coin catchers as coins would frequently miss the catcher and drop down the front. Don't put the coin wrappers in the catchers. A quick fix was to put painters tape half-way around the catchers, thus making a backboard. Haven't had any coins miss since. I have yet to jam it, but I only drop a handful of coins into the hopper at a time. Best part...no batteries; will work for a lifetime.Its quick and easy to sort coins. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Good manual coin sorter,"After reading many reviews of automated and manual sorters, I went with the Royal Sovereign Sort 'N Save (MS-1). Actually sorted through over $400 worth of coins and it did a pretty good job. You have to turn the handle slowly or it jams, but it totally beats counting all that out without one!! Definitely worth the price!"
4,Royal sovereign coin sorter,Very nice. Works well and sorted the money even while my 5-year old grandson was working the bank.
1,Royal No No Coin Machine,"Though the idea of this machine was intriguing, it was useless. Many different coins went down slots meant for different denominations and it kept getting stuck. A shame, a waste of money."
3,"I was impressed, till I went to the bank","I recieved the product, and I had at least $1500 in coin, so I was elated at how well it worked, my best friend took over and had a ton of fun. It worked great... then I went to the bank with bags of rolled coins, and they told me all of them were ""short"". The quarter rolls were on average 4 coins short, the others were 2-4 short.Needless to say, I felt about 2"" tall and wondered if the bank thought I was trying to get over on them.I followed the instructions, but will admit I haven't pulled the machine back out to do a ""re-run"" to see if I might have done something wrong. I can't see how I could have, I filled the wrappers up to the top and relied on the machine's spacer that should have been right. My friend did the same.I'm not totally dissilusioned though. It really does work great for sorting, I'm just going to be more proactive, I will manually make up rolls of coins with the right amount and use them as a gage to make sure my final output is right."
1,Jack,"terrible product, Amazon should not even carry this item. Within 2 min of using it stated to jam. I have wasted more time trying to clean out these jams than using product. Garbage- best way to say without getting too graphic. Have a jam now that I can not clear and give-up. No more time will be wasted by me on this junk. Do not waste your time buying."
4,Good value for the money,"This coin sorter is a good value for the money. The downside is: it can't verify that a coin is a US coin and occasionally will drop a dime in a nickel tube. If you verify all coins are US and you keep an eye on the coins dropping in the tubes, this will work."
4,Sort of ugly but it works,"This is my third coin sorter and so far the best in terms of practicality. The previous two were a battery powered one and then a AC powered version. The problem with those were that the motors eventually failed probably due to accumulated dirt from the coin sorting process. The good thing about this coin sorter is that it's clear so you can see if lint, paper clips, and other things have made their way into the sorter. Most other coin sorters are opaque so you don't know what made it's way in. The crank is easy to operate and shouldn't be a reason not to consider this. Also cranking makes a lot less noise than the buzzing of the motorized models. The only nuisance to this sorter is that if it's on a slanted surface or you crank too fast the coins can miss the tubes and slip out the front. Otherwise a good machine."
4,Simple is better!,"This coin sorter works great and never jams seriously. A simple back turn on the handle and you're back in business. Fast and easy. Even my six and nine year old grandkids can work it with no problems. I don't think it would be the best for a business that constantly used it, but it certainly is reliable for home and occasional use."
2,I've played on better more comfortable and sturdier thrones.,"Be careful you can tip on this it would be more stable with more legs.Not bad for threaded height but should have went with a hydraulic seat.Glad i kept my old throne will switch back and forth might use this for an officechair.Back rest was uncomfortable to me should be wider.The only good thing about this was it was a breeze to put together.By the way,this thing is really heavy and the biker seat could be a lot more comfy.I'm dissatisfied with this but i expect i'll get over it."
1,Piece of Junk,"This keyboards is poorly made, keys stop working in short time. Don't waste your money."
5,easier to see,"great product for the more mature typist.Of course, we are supposed to touch-type,but I was not taught the location of the function keys on the Underwood."
4,Nice pans,"The pans are very nice--great to make a professional cake with. They also arrived promptly. The only thing I might change is the number of petals--these are each 8 petal pans--I've seen more expensive pans with only 5 or 6 petals each. The reason I say this is because when you bake the smallest 8 petal cake, it is a little more difficult to retain the petal shape when frosting it."
5,Great tipper,"This tipper is by far a ""Best Buy"". It has a great feel to it, its heavy weight, and creates a fantastic sound."
5,Clear and precise,"For anyone who has practiced Quigong or Tai Chi for some time,this book offers clear and easy to follow instructions on howto do Swimming Dragon. For the beginner, it provides a startingpoint, and with a mirror and lots of patience much can befigured out. As for the promise of improved health: this is truefor any Quigong done consistently. Personally, I like thatSwimming Dragon can be performed in a very small space, andthat it completely moves the spine."
2,Disappointing results,"I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor, all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste. I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips. Also, the companion pump didn't keep it's prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to ""measure"" easily. (1 pump, 1/2 pump, etc)One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant, and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor."
5,"Just like Starbucks, in my opinion","I find very little difference at all between this and Starbucks. Perhaps it's because I gave up Starbucks when I gained the ability to make these at home and the comparison isn't there for me anymore? not sure, but really, I found this to be highly comparable with Starbucks. It's not too sweet either.I've ordered a few of the 64 oz bottles and something I don't like is that when they arrive, the bottoms are bowed out and they don't sit squarely on the table. I was weary at first because sometimes when products go bad, the packaging becomes misshaped but I went ahead and used it and all 3 containers had perfectly fine/safe contents."
3,tried it but,Tried it to try to do a White Mocha like Starbucks and never could get it right and very messy to dispense.
3,COST OF PUMP IS MORE ?,"Chocolate is great for my morning mochas, but seriously to charge extra for the pump is obsurd, luckily i live near Ghiradelli so go buy it directly from the sorce an everytime they include free pump, i mean seriously how else are you supposed to use it ? though have washed pump an placed in each new bottle. An price is cheaper directly from the source so if you live in or are visitng San Francisco go visit Ghiradelli but if not just remember take the pump apart an wash it so you don't have to buy new ones each time you buy the syrup."
2,Disappointing flavor,"I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor, all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste. I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips.

1,Worst Movie Ever!,"This movie is god awful. It looks good from the previews and stuff but, don't be fooled!! As soon as it was over I took it out of my DVD player and wanted it out of my house. It was so badly put together, no story line (that made sense anyway) and all and all just a straight up terrible movie.I would not recommend purchasing this DVD, just skip this movie all together."
2,had potential; decent cast wasted,"There was some potential here and I kept hoping for a good, coherent resolution. The cast did their best. Unfortunately, the screenwriters did not. I am not even sure what happened here or why anyone would care."
2,disappointed,I was totally disappointed w/ this movie---slow moving---not as scary as I thought it would be---
3,Not AS Bad As People Say,Well. It was just ok. The acting was alright. AnnaLynne McCord is awesome. (That's why I got this) The ending was confusing to me though. I was a little confused. Coulda showed more violence and blood. The main problem with me is that it feels like a Hallmark attempt at scary. It was just plain ok.Not good. Not bad.3/5
1,Am I still awake?,"This movie was positively dreadful. None of the actors does a spectacularly good job with this poorly-written idea. If you need something to put you to sleep, put this movie in, press ""mute"" and enjoy (the soundtrack is boringly similar to any other horror flick in that it has its ""crescendo"" moments which might wake you up). Save your money and watch something else. Anything's gotta be better than this."
2,Abrupt Ending,"Besides the good-looking actresses, what does else this movie have? It has no sustainable plot and the worst part of it all - an ending that ends abruptly!You see the long pauses in screen time of the ""haunting"", of some suspenseful moments in the first half of the movie, only to get to the anti-climax in the last 5 minutes of the movie showing Molly joining the Dark Side after failing to kill herself at the end of the movie? The reasons are not explored. After all that running around, didn't Molly say she wants to be ""saved""? Then what are her reasons for joining the Dark Side? Because she found out that she has turned into an ""X-man/woman"" at the age of 18? The ending is too sudden, too abrupt, too confusing...Want a laugh? Go watch Megan Fox in ""Jennifer's Body"":Jennifer's Body"
1,"""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" is horrible","The whole plot of this film is horrible and cheesy. It really deserved all of the negativity that it got. It's not good at all. It's more of a drama than a thriller-horror if it even is a thriller at all. It's not even good, and there's only one creepy scene; when she looks into the mirror and a creepy face is right next to her. That's the only relatively scary scene. It looks more like a show on the CW than a horror movie, seriously. I also don't like that weird athiest message at the end either. SPOILER: Basically like everyone was demonic, or some crap like that. It's really absolutely nothing you should waste your time on."
2,bad ending,I was really disapointed in this movie . it kept me interested through the whole movie and even made me jump a couple of times . the problem was that the whole movie was about one girl getting scared all the time so after a few good scares it started to get to repetitive . just a bunch of pop up's . but even that would've probably gave this movie a 4 star rating . the reason why I gave it a 2 star was because even though the movie kept me interested it had a horrible ending . this is one of those movies where the ending ruined the whole movie . it would probably be worth no more than $5 to buy just because it was good up til the end .
2,Nothing special and not a ghost movie....,"Its just a shame that these days all movies that are advertised as being ghost movies are really movies about demons. I believe in ghosts not demons. I hate movies that try to pretend they are about one thing when really they are about something else. Like the Paranormal Activity movies. Those trailers and plot outlines make you think its about a ghost, but nope, the work of a demon.Therefore I generally don't give a flying frick about these sorts of films. This really came across as a movie for 12 year olds with nothing really going on. Nothing special and no replay value for me. I won't be watching it again. BUT, its not the worst movie I've ever seen. For a more in-depth review visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile."
3,"Bad story, but highly entertaining","This movie really isn't good. It's just not. It's a hackneyed story that's been done a million times before. But it's really entertaining. I saw it and didn't like it, but the next morning I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's good in the sense that it's engaging and entertaining."
5,Not sure,"This was purchased as a gift. It fit the description of a physically handicapped gentleman's request. However, the merchant, Store51, was terrible about delivery. They claimed to have shipped in Dec in time for the holidays, but I never received it. However, the second shipment arrived around mid January. Not acceptable. I won't deal with this merchant again."
3,A horse health care book that doesn't mention colic?,"This is a good basic book for beginners, but if you have any experience with horses at all it will be WAY to basic for you. it doesn't even mention colic! It should at least list the warning signs. The leg wrapping sections are useful, but really, does anyone really step by step instructions about how to put a blanket on a horse?"
2,Only For Beginers,"In my opinion, this book is not worth buying, unless you are truly a beginner. And even then, you will quickly outgrow this book. It contains practices that you can quickly pick up at the stable where your lessons are. To learn them from others at your stable will more likely help you, because it will be in more detail and you will watch someone do it."
2,NOT THE SEMINAR ON DVD,This book includes a DVD that is a 30 minute book promotion. It is NOT the Love & Respect Conference. If you want the official Love & Respect Conference on DVD you have to order it from www.loveandrespect.com
5,Only on Chapter 2 - But Know It Is A Must Read,This book was recommended to us by our counselor. She is recommending it to every single one of the couples she counsels or has counseled. That's how much she believes in this book. My husband and I read the introduction and knew right away that it was going to help us build a stronger foundation and have a better marriage. The concept is so simple - he needs respect and she needs to know she's loved - but you'll have an A-HA moment and know that it's so very true. The book will feel like it's talking directly to you. Every couple should read this book - happy couples and couples in trouble.
5,Love and Respect: A Seminal Work,"As a Christian family counselor, I can say that without a doubt, this book has transformed my practice. Clients are always recommending books to me that they've found meaningful to them. In an effort to be respectful, I always try to at least look the book over. About seven years ago, a client insisted I read Love and Respect, and I uttered the customary response: ""I'll take a look"". From the moment I opened it, I could tell that this book was different. Since I began utilizing this book in virtually all marriage counseling sessions, cases that in the past had taken months or years to resolve, were suddenly transformed. In fact, the extent to which a couple a couple is able to adhere to the Love and Respect (biblical) principles, determines how quickly and completely they are able to resolve their issues. Thank you Dr. Eggerichs for this tremendous book.Lee L. MFT"
5,Sunny,I purchased this book and would do so again it arrived on time and in perfect condition...no tears or rips on pages...
5,Very helpful information!,"My husband and I attended the Love & Respect seminar a few years ago and having the book around is a wonderful tool to refer to. I especially appreciate the biological approach that shows that men and women are wired differently. That doesn't make one right and the other wrong, it's just different. Dr Eggerichs explains the ""crazy cycle"" that so many of us fall into and how to stop repeating it so that both husband and wife get what they need from the relationship, bringing about more of what the other needs and turning the crazy cycle into a healthy one.I also appreciate the Scriptural basis for the logic and reasoning, as Christ is the center of all good marriages. Buy this book and follow its principles and see how your marriage is healed and made better!"
1,sexist-zero stars,"What is wrong with you people? Are men the only ones who have sexual desires that need acknowledgment? Do women not deserve respect? These stereotypes of women are so over-the-top insulting, that I can't believe there are so many crazy brainwashed ""Christians"" out there in the world buying it.If you want help with your marriage,leave Jesus out of it. Not everything in the bible should be taken so literally!"
1,Please,"Once again the perfect example of if Women would be more needy then men would love us more.I bought this book for a 14 hour plane trip. It was one of the few things that caught my eye in the airport store. I finally decided that I would rather read the vomit bag. That was at least useful.I just sat there thinking, It is not wrong for me to be financially independent from my husband. That is not disrespectful to him. If he takes it that way, then his ego is the problem. Not anything that I have done.I need/want my husband because we are equals.What happened to thinking that we were grown-ups and that we could treat each other that way? I have no use for these mind games.Yes love & respect each other. But don't force it. Don't change who you are.God gave both men & women brains to avoid this type of right wing preaching."
4,This has been needed for years!,"This is a great book based on what is most important to men and women in marriage. This is about traditional values of trying to make a marriage work by making your spouse's needs your priority. I would not recommend it for people who are in abusive verbal, emotional or physical relationships. This is for people who have a basically good person they're married to, but it seems that they cannot connect. Awesome book!"
5,Great book!,"Besides the Bible, this is probably the best book written on male/female specific sources of conflict. It clearly and simply explains the most common reasons for conflict and how they can be avoided. It opened my eyes to life changing truths that had always been cloudy to me. A must read for all adults, Christian or not!"
5,A must for women who want their husbands to feel appreciated,"This book taught me so much about what men want and need: Respect. Just like the song says, R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Well it may have been sung by Aretha, but it was written by Otis Redding. I tried the respect test that he suggests in the book, something along the lines of ""I just want you to know how much I respect about you."" And walking away, well my husband brought me flowers that night.Then I wrote the respect letter that he suggests, verbatim. My husband said it was the nicest letter he'd ever received. Our husbands need to know we respect them. They already know we love them.Every woman should read this book."
5,Love and Respect,I am a student at Liberty University and was required to read this book. I am not sorry that I did. It uncovers the secret to what a man needs and how to give him this. It also teaches men the secret to what a woman needs from a relationship. This book is a great tool that will help to strengthen a marriage.
4,I wish I had read this earlier!,"This book had an important message. My wife had read it in the early part of our marriage, and had tentatively suggested I read it also. Of course, it took me five years to pick it up but I wish I had sooner. I laughed out loud at the accuracy of the descriptions of the feel of our crazy cycle arguments. I would imagine you will have similar moments of almost excruciating recognition.It has given me the language of being able to articulate my feelings and thus own them.My only two criticisms are:- it is repetitive at the beginning- it is biased towards the wife taking more responsibility for unconditional respect than the husband giving unconditional love.The ""answers"" COUPLE and CHAIR are simple yet profound. I think this book will make a huge difference in most marriages and it allows me to feel excited and optimistic about ours."
5,Love & Respect,Great book. Helps you understand your spouse better. I would highly recommend that any married couple reads this book. I was shocked at how differently men and women look at a situation. I didn't realize how much my husband needs respect.
5,I loved this book,I have suggested this book to several of my friends and family. It has been a God send to us
5,A life changing book...,"No matter how good your marriage is--you will learn something helpful from this book! I have never read a more realistic book on marriage or its real issues. Every woman wants to be loved unconditionally--no matter how bad her day or mood is, she still wants her man to love her inspite of the way she comes across. Every man wants to be respected unconditionally even after he makes mistakes or has comes across in a ""less than perfect"" manner. Emerson helps both husband and wife be able to meet these deep and basic needs in each other. The result is a loving and pleasant marriage and home. Not only does Emerson clearly articulate our marriage problems and issues, but he has a simple and easily understood solution. He does this in such a way that even after you lay the book down you will still remember what it said and how to apply it to your life. It doesn't get better than this. Read it today!"
5,Love & Respect,This is a book my wife and I send to friends especially married couples when the magic is fading.Purchasing through Amazon ensures we get the purchases delivered where we want and in a sensible time scale.
5,Love & Respect can save your marriage!,"""Love and Respect"" gives Godly insight into how men and women can relate to one another to save a bad marriage or make even the best marriage better! That insight can also be used to improve non-marital relationships involving male and female - parent/child, brother/sister, at work, at church, and anywhere else in life. I highly recommend the book, the audio CD's, and the associated products and seminars to everyone."
3,Good but long,"I think this book definitely tackles an important topic: men need to SHOW love for their wives and women need to SHOW respect for their husbands. However the book is far too long and tends to repeat itself quite a bit. It feels like the authors are ""spinning out"" a concept that could have been written in a more concise manner. I think it's a useful book, anyhow."
5,Awesome Christian view on Relationships,"This book is a great source on christian relationships. Share in Bible study, women prayer meetings and also pass along to young women."
5,Everyone should get this!,"I got this for my fiancé and I to read. We are not finished yet, but it is a GREAT book and every committed couple should read this."
3,So-so,"This book is just okay. Not a total waste of time, but a lot of the examples are cheesy and stereotypical. Often, the man is coming home from work and the woman is doing domestic things. Also, Eggerichs overdoes it on the seeing blue/seeing pink examples. I think he simplifies both genders too much, which is funny at times, but sometimes lacks serious depth. This book is alright, but I expected more."
4,Good book so far,"I haven't had a chance to finish reading this book but so far I like what I've read, definitely like seeing both sides"
2,I haven't been able to get beyond the first chapter.,Other books have covered this material so why do we need another one? Someone who hasn't read as widely in this field might like it.
4,Emi's Respect & Love,"This book is very good for couples who have been married one year or 50. I also would recommend this for couples planning to marry. It gives a good perspective from male and female sides, but could go a little further in showing respect and love for the wife cannot be seperated. Love will respect and respect will bring love."
5,Love and Respect,Received the book in a timely fashion in excellent condition. It is a very good book for couples.
5,End The Cycle,This book changed the way I view relationships forever. In it the author describes the rules to creating a godly marriage and I would say a godly relationship between a man and a women. It is a simple and easy read that once you start to pull back the layers on this onion makes you say wow I understand that. The message is simple and the title explains it all. Get the book if your struggling in your marriage get the book if your not get the book so that you can prevent it.
5,AMAZING no other like it out there.,"This books is amazing, it shares so much from the males point of view,finally their is a book out there that knows what we go through and that we do want to make our wives happy and loved. i caught my self laughing a few times because i can relate to so many stories. This book has really taught me how to talk and give the attention my wife really desires and in return i get the respect that i need. The information in this book blew my mind, by far the best book i purchased."
3,too long,"I thought the book brought up some valid points, but it could have done it with a lot fewer words."
5,Es muy bueno ayudo mi matrimonio,"I decided to buy this book for my husband, and helped him a lot. he is another person, but really want to change. read it is very good"
1,The DVD was not included with the book as promised.,I purchased this book believing the DVD was included because of the add listing. When I opened the package and the book the DVD was no where to be found. I am very disappointed and feel cheated. I will not rcommend this site amy longer.
3,mediocre,"left a bit to be desired, but a good basic book of advice for someone who is not fully versed on the Biblical view of marriage."
4,"Light Switch Turned ""On""",I really enjoyed this book. It brought about a view that I never considered with my husband. I didn't think that I was not seeing his view until reading this book and looking back over some of the issues we have had. I am happy that I brought this book. I would suggest it as a good read to anyone. The only complaint that I do have with the book was that he does repeat the concept several times and takes quite a bit to move on. But the eye opener effect that this book had with me was more important than reading some of the same points over again. Heck... I probably needed to reread them over and over again to get accustomed to the new concept. All in all I would buy this book again.
3,Not for me,"I could not get past page 13 of this book. I was drowning in what the wife needed to do for the husband to the point where I began to resent the author for being a pig. I'm sure he isn't a pig. But this was a bit too traditional for me.I couldn't get into it.I think this is great for very very traditional couples, religious couples. But for folks who want to read about themselves instead of the author -- try the 5 Love Languages instead."
4,very insightful,Gave this book to 2 people as gifts and they said it's a big eyeopener. They are still reading it but thus far they find it very helpful!
3,Very repetative...,"I appreciated the premise of the book. However, if you've read the introduction and first chapter you've read the whole thing. The rest of the book is simply a restatement of the premise. Not a lot of practical info. Wait for the movie..."
5,A Great Book to help with Marriage and Relationships,"I had a hard time putting this book down. It definitely opened my eyes to a greater and better understanding of Love and Respect for my Wife. I have already seen wonderful results from applying the tools and words from this book. I would love to attend a Love and Respect connection conference, I am positive my Wife and myself would benefit greatly from it.I also enjoyed how Dr. Eggerichs writes about his personal experiences with his Wife Sarah. Thank you so much for the eye opener, as I have had diffulculties with my newly Marriage too, but now is going in the right direction, from the Crazy cycle to more of the energizing cycle.I have recommended this book to many people that I know.I Hope there will be more to come.Best Wishes"
1,Oh so poorly written,"This book was practically torture to read through. I could not get over the fact that he never defined respect, or even what he meant by love. Also, enough with the quotes already! His book is half letters from (mostly women) who have read his book or attended his conference and ""have never heard this message before now."" Really? You've never learned that it's important to love and respect your spouse??? Huh?? Who are these people is what I want to know. And, doesn't everyone, regardless of gender, need both love and respect? How do you love someone without showing them respect? Why does he never state that a woman also needs respect? To top it off, it is really poorly written. Ugh..Please, do not waste your time with this book."
1,Disappointing,I agree with the other posters who gave it one star. Nearly all the material was opinion based and no research to back it up. The author suggests that women need to forget being tired and give sex to their men. It is more geared toward men than women. And my fiance said that he needs love more than respect.This book is mainly commentary and nothing else. I wasn't impressed and I won't read the book any longer.
5,Great tool for marriage counseling...,"Dr. Eggerichs describes how women desire to be loved above all else, and men desire to be respected above all else. The entire book is based upon Ephesians 5:33, which says, ""However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband."" The concepts in this book have helped my husband and I in our own marriage, and it has given us tools to use as we counsel other married couples.There are 5 appendixes in the back that will give you practical tools to help you put all the information you've learned into action. For example, you will learn what to say, do, or think to practice love and respect in your marriage and how to meet your spouse's needs.I highly recommend this book for your own marriage, and as a tool to help others when needed."
1,Biased,"This book is very slanted toward meeting the husband's need in order for a couple to have a healthy, strong marriage; equal weight is not given in examples or instructions on how to love your wives and therefore meet her needs. Couples who are looking for a balanced view and for healing in both of themselves and their relationship would do better working through How We Love by the Yerkovich's."
3,An important message for those who still need to learn it,"I gave this book three stars because I learned the lesson of the book in one sentence. Wives need to respect their husbands, and husbands need to love their wives. The book goes into all of the hows and whys of doing that, but because those scenarios happened to be obvious to me, the chapters felt like they wasted my time. If loving your wife or respecting your husband is difficult for you, then I definitely recommend this book. If it comes easy for you at this point in life, then read something else instead."
5,Great book!,This book is a great staple for any married couple. I ordered this book via kindle so no problems with shipping occured :-)
1,Love & Respect,"I'm a christian who has read many books on relationships but this book has to the worst. No matter what the situation is in a relationship, one must reserve their own self-respect. I felt as though all will be well if she respects her man is crazy. I felt like he was saying ""just keep lovin'your man and all will be fine. Love must be strong and tough. Understand that I believe in the biblical concept of submission, but there is a difference between being a confident spiritually submissive woment and a rug for someone to walk all over."
2,No note as ordered inputed for my gift,"When I ordered these 3 books, 2 of them were gifts and were suppose to have something written on them for as a gift.There information as we ordered.The books are great, but not what we ordered."
1,lack of gospel message,"I didn't appreciate this book because it lacked any kind of gospel-saturated ideals of marriage. It exalted the Author's theory of what makes a good marriage over what the Bible says makes a good marriage. The Author does use scripture but only to support his ""secret recipe theory"". This theory, in a nut shell, is simple: The wife needs to feel loved by her husband and the husband needs to feel respected by his wife. The focus of the book is on the characteristics of the two individuals of a marriage and not on Christ, the Church, the Spirit, or the Father. This is why I did not appreciate the book."
2,too long,I thought this book was very enlightening and practical. The concepts made a lot of sense and i believe they would help any marriage out of the gutter or a good one get better. I thought that the book was much too long for the content covered. It gets very repetitous and I found myself skipping through pages that seemed to be exactly like the previous ones. It kind of becomes like an extended attempt in trying to prove his theory. I believe the theory but it didn't take over 300 pages to get there. Chapter one pretty much did it.
5,Helped!,Me and my husband loved it! It pretty much was right on for what we needed to hear at that time.
4,Good Book,"My DH and I are going through this book as part of a group and have enjoyed the topics brought up so far. It is a good idea to have someone to discuss it with because the discussion helps give additional perspective to the topic being discussed in the book. It is fairly light reading, for a personal development book, with lots of anecdotal stories. We have all agreed that the stories are probably extreme cases, but serve to accent the point that Eggerichs is trying to make. It hasn't revolutionized our marriage like The 5 Love Languages did, but overall we are enjoying the book. I just wish we could have gotten the small (regular) print version for the same price."
4,Easy Read,"This is kind of a no brainer to me, but my husband actually read it to and loved it. He's not much of a reader either."
5,Great,"This book is very good. This book has helped us to bring biblical principles and scriptures into the ""everyday"" of our marriage. It's helped us communicate better and understand how the other communicates."
5,This is a must read!,I have bought approximately 5 copies of this book and given them away to friends. I have used it to teach small groups on the power of living relationships the way they are intended to be lived. I have also realized the power of this book in my own marriage and family life. It is great!
5,Best book on marriage bar none,"This is a practical book on marriage and communication that is effective from the start. Every couple, married or engaged, should read it."
5,Love and Respect Book,"This book actually provides a way for men and women to understand eachother and work out why and how they feel towards oneanother. As a woman, I realized from the book that my husband deserves kindness and respect as much as I think I deserve love and understanding. It goes both ways. I highly recommend the book. It is very good."
5,This is working for me!,"While I am still working on my husband to read this book, and I feel only then will the magic of this plan REALLY unfold, I can see the difference with just what I am doing on my part-showing unconditional respect for my husband. I have been telling all my friends and coworkers about it. I think this really works, and is for EVERY couple. It explains to men what women really want and how to show them love. It explains to women what men really want and how to give it. I'm excited about it. I think this guy is right on."
5,Highly recomened!,All I have to say is I wish I had read this book when I was first married. Although I am divorced I found this book very insightful. I learned a lot about my past relationships and what I needed to improve on for my next one. By all means please read this even if you do not have any signs of trouble in your marriage. It can only help you to avoid the ruts and future problems.God Bless
3,Review for seller,I am sad to say that my review will be mediocre for this seller. I had received the book a little late and this seller did not include the dvd that came with the book. I am really disappointed that I payed for this dvd with the book and I didn't receive it. The book did come in good condition.
5,Makes perfect sense,This book is well-written and can help you save your marriage. We all go through the 'crazy cycle'. This book has excellent bible based solutions to challenges we all face in our marriages. We liked this book so much that we bought a copy for every member of our family. You don't have to have a troubled marriage to find this book useful.
3,I'm being generous,"I started reading this book, and at first I thought I may have been letting my own personal feelings and my past hurts keep me from receiving what I needed to get from it. But as I read on, I found myself more and more offended.Don't get me wrong. Eggerich makes a lot of good points. God's word is true no matter how we look at it. But my first offense was when I noticed that he refered to men as men, but women as 'gals' and 'ladies'. I know it's a small thing, but it just grated at me. Then as I read more I just felt like Eggerich was just not balanced. Just as someone else posted, I would have liked to read how his wife felt.Oh, yeah, and that whole story about him forgetting her birthday really made me shake my head.I had hopes for something more."
2,Disks won't even play!,"These disks would not play at all in my car (my other discs played just fine). The disc player just clicked repeatedly while the info screen said ""no disk"" or ""check disk"" or ""insert disk."" Unfortunately, the series will have to be sent back. On a better note, though, my friend has done this series with her husband. They loved it and recommended it to me. I will be asking for a replacement so that my husband and I can still do the program."
2,Love & Respect (Condition of Book),"This book was purchased used with a rating of (like new). Problem being this book has underlining in black ink an almost every page in it. It also had peoples names written on a number of the pages. The rating on this book was extreamly misleading. I have purchased many books with lesser ratings and received better quality books in the past. Maybe it was just this particular distributer. I don't know, all I do know is that I'm not happy with the condition of this book."
5,Wish I read it five years ago,"Our marriage has endured a lot in five years (becoming Christians, infertility concerns, cross-country move, birth of 2 children, overcoming an affair, job loss. . .)We are blessed to be where we are today. This book offers something for every couple regardless of how weak or strong your marriage is. We consider ourselves quite happily married, I hope that the Biblical realizations offered by this book will bring us even greater strength as we grow together."
5,"God's design for marriage is miraculous, like the designer","Love & respect is the designer's design for marriage. This book dwells on this basic command for married people: the woman needs to feel loved and the man needs to feel respected, and both of these needs must be met whether your partner deserves it or not! Hardly a message that sits well in our ""me"" age, but that is exactly why it works: it is a command because it doesn't come naturally, but, as with every command God gives, it is for our good and for our blessing. SO MANY friends to whom I have given this book have thanked me profusely, saying it has turned their marriages around. Invest in this one!!!!"
1,This book is REDUNDANT!,"The book gives some helpful insight. However, I will save you a lot of time. This about sums it up. Wives, respect your husband and then he will love you. You would be better off reading some material from Family Life Today."
1,"this book has dangerous, wrong teachings","Elizabeth Esther has written a review that brings to light some teachings that are wrong and dangerous. Please read it as her website (her name), Jan 2013 post. You'll be glad you did."
1,Poor Service,Ordered the book with DVD and never received the DVD. Thumbs down for this one. I even left a message with customer service! Good thing I did not have to pay full price.
3,good points but stereotypical,"As a Christian womam who's married, respect is every bit as important to me as love. And I don't think I'm alone in that either.The book has some good adivce, such as focusing on the good intentions of your spouse, but for the most part, the book is far too stereotypical, in my opinion."
2,Enough information for a phamplet,"The message contained within this book is good, although the book itself is much too long and poorly written. While reading it, I got the distinct impression the author was merely filling up pages without presenting any new information. There are also a few catch phrases the author uses over and over which are extremely annoying."
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"The basic content and premise of this book could have been condensed into one chapter. I don't understand why this book is so popular (well actually maybe I do - because it is filled with the simpleton partner manipulating but practical advice that normally sells marriage books). The author makes some interesting observations but does little to address the root cause of problems in marriage. If you want to read a great, scriptural book on marriage, check out, ""When Sinners Say I Do"" by Dave Harvey."
4,Love & Respect,"This is an absolute blessing! If you think/believe your marriage is unchangable and stuck on the road of depression and unhappiness, GET THIS BOOK. DO NOT let the Devil win and allow God back in to bless your marriage...."
2,guess I'm not a typical woman,"I'm slightly confused by Dr. Eggerichs' view that married women are incapable of enjoying sex solely for the pleasure of sex itself and percieve it only as a weapon to be used against their husbands. Is this a reflection on his own marriage, I wonder?Dr. Eggerichs ideas of how women think are very narrow and stereotypical. I repeatedly found myself having to tell my husband ""That's not how I feel"", ""That's not what I think"" and ""That's not what I want from you."""
1,Corny and not helpful,"My husband and I were given this book for pre-marital counseling by our pastor and also by some of our Christian friends. I am a therapist and have read many other similar books by John Gottman and others. My husband and I are both Christians, but this book was ridiculous. The way in which the authors explain concepts was very corny and my husband and I spent a lot of time laughing at it. I don't think we even finished the book because it was so unhelpful. There are a lot of other really great books out there that teach the same or better lessons. Don't be fooled into thinking its a good book just because it comes from a Christian base. By the way, we just celebrated our 2 year anniversary."
4,"Good, but a Little Too Much Self-Praise and Repetition","The biblical principles behind this book are solid and reliable, even if presented somewhat simplistically and repetitively. This book would have been better (and shorter) if the author had restrained from repeatedly praising his own seminars, books, principles, etc. so many dozens of times. Nevertheless, anyone applying the main lessons of ""Love and Respect"" to their spousal relationship as well as their relationship with God is sure to reap the blessings and benefits."
3,Some true,Wife should respect husband spiritually. A church lady said that it took her 18 years to make her husband feel that he is well respected by her. It isn't easy. But the fruit is sweet.
3,Given as a Gift,"I can't comment on this item, I gave it as a gift. It came in a timley fashion, packaged well with no damage,"
1,Really???,"This book was recommended to me by a counselor to assist me in working through some tough marriage problems. Sadly, I found this book sexist and offensive. In reading it, I find it difficult to conceive that my husband is somehow more deserving of respect than I am because I am a woman. I work full time, just as hard as he does. The main reason our relationship is failing is because of how he's treated me and his spending habits. At least for me, this book is out of touch with my beliefs."
1,Gross Misinterpretation of Biblical Concepts,"Love & Respect is one of the worst so-called biblical books on marriage that I have ever read. Dr. Emerson Eggerichs clearly hates women and uses twisted biblical concepts to degrade and humiliate women while promoting male superiority. At no time does he acknowledge that love is God' first priority. His video series is equally demeaning to women and glorifies the male ego to the exclusion of a woman's God given needs. He is rude, caricature-ish, disrespectful, and abusive to women all while attempting to be funny. Eggerichs essentially blames women for the majority of all problems in marriage while giving a free pass to men on their sinful nature which is the result of the fall of man from a Christians perspective. I would never recommend this book and/or video series to anyone seeking to seriously understand and improve their marriage in God's way. If I could give this book half a star, I would!"
2,Not recommended for everyone,"Eggerichs has some sound biblical points, but the book seemed to only fit a certain kind of couple (nagging wife, passive/silent husband). As a Christian woman and counselor, I did find myself offended at some of his presumptions about women, and feel that he did have a biased view. I did not feel understood as a woman. This book is helpful for a couple where the woman is the main problem (being disrespectful and nagging), and the onus seems to be on her, wheras the man's issue seems to be much less offensive (not demonstrating love). It seems to take the personal issues of his relationship with his wife and generalize them to the public. I found Ken Nair's book ""Discovering the Mind of a Woman"" to be much more insightful and helpful, where the man takes the role of the servant leader and takes the first step in fostering change."
5,LOVE AND RESPECT,"I purchased two of these books for my granddaughters as they were recommended to my granddaughters, in fact, used by one of the granddaughters churches locally in their parents classes. I also purchased a workbook which I understand has been quite helpful also."
5,He NEEDS my RESPECT,"We did a study on this book in our small group @ church. I didn't realize how much he needs my respect as much as I need him to love me. I encourage to pass this on after you have read it. If you have a spouse that won't read this book with you, please read it! Practice the principles of respecting him and loving her. I promise God will give you strength to fulfill his will for your marriage!"
2,"For women, not men","Our counselor recommended this for both of us. Seems like its good for women, but it's incredibly difficult to read as a man."
2,Love and Respect Review,"This was a hard read. I really did not agree with the fact that every woman is the same as every other and so is every man. I also found it very repeatable. I much prefer His Needs, Her Needs because it causes you to examine your spouse's need and fill it."
5,Married? Then this is a must read!,"This book was one of the most life changing books I have ever read (next to the Holy Bible). As a married man I knew exactly what I wanted. I also knew exactly when I wasn't getting it. What I did not know was how to convey that to my wife without seeming as though I was condemning her. After I read this book I was armed with an onslaught of new information that became the catalyst for what is now a happy, thriving marriage. Big surprise that the bulk of the changes started with and in me. Realizing what my wife needed allowed me to focus on meeting her needs, which in turn freed her to meet mine. If you are thinking at all about getting this book, DO IT! It's a no brainer."
5,Highly recommended as a wedding gift,I highly recommend this for anyone entering a new marriage. Learning these simple things early will save a marriage from years of mistakes.
5,Now it makes sense!,"Never has anyone put so clearly the 2 roles for women and men. This has so helped me understand the differences between my husband and myself. It has clearly helped us help other couples, even our own adult children!I highly recommend this book for any couples that want to understand and change the insane cycles that torment our marriages! Since I live in Brazil, the translation in Portuguese has been another tremendous tool to help couples in their marriages!"
3,Interesting but a little too heavy on religion,"Recently I have become fascinated by the differences between men and women. Of course I read John Gray's classic Mars and Venus books whih were basic and interesting. Wanting to purse it further, I read a few other books which said basically the same thing. This one does too in the love vs respect department, but,just a personal taste, it was a little too religiously oriented for me."
4,Great book.,"I highly recommend this book to all couples, especially ones with serious problems. It is a really good foundation to get yourselves on. If you don't know what you should expect from your partner, reading this will get you started."
3,It speaks the truth,"This may be difficult for stubborn or hard headed people to take in. I have enjoyed reading it in my forties and find it to be true. However, I would have probably tossed it in a bon fire in my twenties! It is biblically based and the reader must be ready to read it and in a ""teachable"" moment otherwise it will do not good and quite possible increase anger. Again, I do find it to be very helpful and truthful."
5,Great read,"A married friend recommended this book to me(i'm single) and it's a great eye opener. This book has definitely opened my eyes to the importance of respecting the men in our lives and how much that truly affects them. As I read it I can identify a few things in myself and things i've encountered in men (stone walling lol). As other reviewers stated it can be a bit redundant, however the key points of Love & Respect need to be drilled deep down in us. I also love the scripture backings!"
1,the title says it all,"I bought this book with my fiance as part of our marriage-preparation studies. IT WAS TERRIBLE. It basically reiterates the same principle over and over and over again in every chapter in not altogether different ways. A DVD (about 15 minutes long) came with the book and after viewing it, the book became meaningless. It was all on the DVD - the whole principle of the book.Furthermore, I am far from a feminist, but the book is very slanted against women. It claims that it's really the woman's fault that the man reacts unlovingly. This really bothered me. My fiance was also sorely disappointed. I do NOT recommend it. Just watch the DVD if you can."
2,Take it or Leave it,"Ok so I get the concept behind the book, but thought the book was very biased against women. Eggerichs very clearly points out women's faults and that we should respect our husband no matter what and they will love us in return, but he doesn't call for a husband to love his wife even when he isn't feeling respected. I felt like I was being beaten over the head that it's always a woman's fault no matter what the man has done. I also felt that it gives a man an excuse to use or misuse his authority. If a man is not feeling respect, it excuses him from loving his wife and gives him an excuse to be unfaithful while she is expected to not only forgive him but respect him. Not all women are the nagging and yelling type but it portrays all women this way and the men get portrayed as always doing the right thing because they walk away.This book had some good points, but could have been summed up in just a few pages instead of many chapters. After reading it, I felt very disappointed."
5,Love her and respect him.,I Love this book. I am deployed and got this book at the Chapel. It's a very interesting book. I ordered this book for my wife and she is loving it also.
2,"Redundant, Flawed Exegesis","I just got married, and my wife is shocked that there aren't more Christian women that have a problem with Eggerich's assertion that men hold 51% of the responsibility in the marriage. I simply don't deduce that over the Ephesians 5 passage. I have read and studied many commentaries on that passage, and it's just amazing to me that the ""submit/love"" call and Eggerich's denunciation of a ""mutual submission"" idea is so widely accepted. It's not about feminism or sexism--it's about outright exegetical misinterpretation. I'm surprised no one else in the reviews has mentioned the ""51% doctrine."""
5,This is a great book no matter where you are at in your marriage,"My husband and I read this book with a group of friends. It was well explained, fair to both partners,and wonderfully easy to apply to real life. I would have to say the greatest thing about this book was how well the author understood me as a woman as well as marriage relationships in general. In the group of us who read this our ages differed vastly as well as the amount of time all of us had spent being married, all of found this book to be wonderfully helpful. I have recommended the book to others and will continue doing so."
5,Required Reading!,"This is just one of those things where I was at the right time in my life, and the right thing fell into my hands and it JUST CLICKED. This is the book that did it. I've been married 9 years- where has this book been?? I've just been given the key to the best marriage possible! I can't believe it's such a simple concept, but so hard to deliver. Men have been without respect for a long time, now I'm making sure my man isn't one of them. I file this book under ""REVOLUTIONARY.""ALSO: I read this around the time I read ""Sacred Marriage"" by Gary Thomas. Awesomeness! My husband thanks me."
4,Excellent Book,This a great book whether you have been married for years or you are just in a committed relationship. This book really hits the nail on the head with the concepts it shows!
5,Love and Respect : What every man and woman wants!!!,"This book is for the 1st time marriage to the 50th Anniversary marriages! We have learned how to not step on one anothers air hoses, breathing and living a better marriage. We both wished we could have read this book 22 years ago!I have also sent one to my sister, in hopes it will help out her marriage as much as it helped out us!"
1,Old fashioned and offensive,"I'm engaged and got this as a Christmas present. Not only is it sexist to both women and men, some of the ideas in here are just offensive. There was one line about domestic abuse and how if a husband abuses his wife, he's probably going to do it whether or not she respects him so she might as well honor him. There's another line about the horrors of daycare and how women should stay home with the children. That's great if that's what the wife wants- but what if works fulfills her? What if they can't afford daycare? Most importantly the overall premise of the book is flawed. Every man I've known wants love as much as respect. If he doesn't value love, what is he doing in a relationship? And in 2013, if men don't respect women and honor what they do in and out of the home, they're probably going to end up alone or divorced. Dr. Eggerichs took one ridiculous, simplistic idea and ran with it."
3,service was great.,I purchased this book and it was sent right away recieved it alot quicker than i expected.
5,Suburbia,This movie is still as great as it was back in 1984. This movie is a cult classic MUST HAVE!
5,Memories,I remember watching this all the time when I was a teen... back on VHS and what-not. Its about time its released on DVD. I hate buses!
4,yay! its poseur time!,"heres why it gets 4 stars....awesome TSOL footage....footage of the VANDALS right b4 they slipped into permanent crappiness....solid proff why FLEA has always sucked, and will always suck...even if we was in FEAR for 10 minutes and the WEIRDOS for 5....the pet rat outacts him the whole flick....did you know keith morris from the CIRCLE JERKS started the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS?...yup they stole it.....the pointless phrase "" guess what??....chickenbutt!"" which pretty much saves the movie and...and....you get to see fake punkers and exploitation in all its cheap lowbudget glory...i was there and it was nothing like this. ever. not even close. but hey its hollywood and its worth pickin up if you love L.A. punk..which was the best punk scene ever....anywhere......"
1,I guess I'm the only one,"A bunch of lowlifes rip the clothes off of a girl and she stands there naked screaming for minutes. All of the T.R. kids stand around and laugh at this naked girl screaming. The adult gets on the microphone and says ""Hey you guys, leave that girl alone, or no punk rock music for you""! This scene was so unbelievably stupid! If a young girl got all of her clother ripped off and was standing in the middle of a public place crying and screaming, no adult would say to ""leave her alone"" and ""knock it off you guys""! So after this moronic scene, we are supposed to like the T. R. kids? Why? Also the racism towards the kids' stepdad was not making me like these losers any more. Are punks supposed to hate black people? No! This is my review so please click on ther button that says this was not helpful. Then you will be cool and hardcore!"
2,dated and irrelevant,"SUBURBIA has a few good moments, but it mainly functions on stereotypes and situations that would never happen in the real world. The scenes and dialogue remind me of what a high school student might write in a creative writing class. It is somewhat interesting as a footnote to history for display of the fashion and sound of the LA punk scene of the time. However, for many people that isn't a very interesting subject. More depth on motivations and causes could have made it a great movie."
3,Great Movie But Poor Transfer To DVD,"Suburbia does an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980's. All of its music and fashion (long before the goth look became trendy) is accurately portrayed. Whereas in SLC punk where you had actors portraying punk rockers, the kids in Suburbia were actually part of the hardcore music scene.My biggest disappointment with this DVD though is it's quality. As this was one my favorite movies from my teen years, I was hoping that the DVD would be a nice clear print of the film. Instead, it looks like the film was transferred from a VHS tape. Very poor sound and video. The commentary by director Penelope Spheeris is also lacking in that she should have included some of the ""punk"" actors. It would have been interesting to hear their take on this film (and the hardcore scene) 20 years later.I would have given this DVD 5 stars but have subtracted two points for the poor quality of the transfer."
