4,Loved it,This worked great for my son's oral biography! He looked so cute and he loved dressing up! The product worked great and came very quickly so he was set!
1,Do not buy,"The item in the package is NOT what was pictured. The helmet is cheap black and velvet looking, not at all what is pictured. The goggles look like make shift harry potter glasses with a strap and the scarf is much smaller and much cheaper looking than pictured. DO NOT BUY this product, it is not worth the 13 dollars and shipping."
2,Not what you see in pic.,I should have read the reviews before ordering. This is a cloth hat not leather like as it shows in pic and scarf is much shorter and fringe all messed up. It's alright but you're not getting what is shown.
1,"cheap, garbage",I bought this for a book report my son was doing on Amelia Earhart. It is garbage. Cheap googles that broke immediately and had to be rigged up and a little piece of material that is the scarf.
3,you get what you pay for,"The goggles have one strap that attaches with velcro and have foam around the eye pieces, not authentic looking at all. The scarf is about 2"" wide and just over 24"" long, not what I would call a scarf. It does not resemble the picture in any way, it looks like a piece of scrap material. The head piece is the best part of the costume."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This was an economically price costume piece, but the actual product fell far short of my expectations. The hat is not made out of a leather-like material at all and wasn't even shiny, it was a mate poly-blend of some kind. The goggles did have lenses, but the plasic had foam around the goggle part.We used it for a minor part in a play, so from a distance it looked alright.Overall it was a cheap price, but it was also a cheap product."
1,Do not buy,I bought this set for my son's book report mainly because of the white scarf. The scarf is not a scarf because it does not fit around a neck. It is so cheaply made that it is already falling apart a soon as you open the bag.
2,Okay for one use only,"This costume was barely sufficient for one use. The goggles broke even before my daughter used them for her biography presentation. I hot glued them together for the day of her presentation, but by the end of the day, the foam had completely separated from the goggles. They are going in the trash. The cap is holding up fine, but the scarf started unravelling immediately. This costume was fine for a young child to use once. The scarf is very short and would not fit well on a larger child or adult."
3,spooked,"An amazing true story of a woman seeking justice for herself from the other side of the grave. Well written and the story get you hooked, and it all really happened."
5,A must have for people who live with rabbits.,"This book is right on! As the roommate of 4 house bunnies (sometimes I think they ""own"" me), my copy of the House Rabbit Handbook is never very far away. You learn something new everytime you look through it. The most useful sections for me were about bonding bunnies (she gives you a specific formula that works in most bondings) and the food section (with a breakdown of and comparision of many common veggies and hay). If a rabbit lives with you or you are thinking about sharing your home with one read this book immediately!"
5,A must for new rabbit owners,"I wish I had bought and read this book before I purchased my furry friend. It describes what to look for in a new bun and signs of illness. The author also helps decipher bun behavior....or rather ""speech"". She, the author, goes into care, feeding, housing, and love for your bun. A good book for beginners or just a bun lover."
5,Excellent.,"There seem to be a number of bunny books, with limited information, written in a tone which addresses children. Finally, I'm glad to find a rabbit book for mature readers that provides more advanced information."
5,It's simply the best,This book was and is very helpful for us and our rabbit. And I appreciate very much that it doesn't have a chapter of breeding but instead chapters like how to make life better for an older rabbit. I recommend to every rabbitfriend to look at the homepage of the House Rabbit Society .
5,This is THE house rabbit bible. BUY extra copies for frien,"I never knew how much a rabbit could mean to me and my family. This book is a house rabbit education. Anyone who cares about rabbits, needs a copy. I am now buying extras to donate to organizations that care for bunnies and need to be educated on doing it properly."
4,Excellent content!,"I read this book and I love it! Rabbits are personable creatures and are often misunderstood. This book shows rabbits for what they really are, wonderful, playful companions! The black & white photos just don't do these beautiful creatures justice."
2,Not the best book about rabbit care but better than some,Although this book does include more information than many pet rabbit care books it doesn't live up to the hype and contains some inaccuracies. Most of the information in it I've read elsewhere except perhaps the spay/neuter message. The chapter on diet was poorly written and I'm sure most pet owners would not be able to understand it. A much better book for pet rabbit owners is Rabbits by Monika Wegler.
3,Good content but disappointing presentation,"I ordered this book as a gift for my granddaughter. I had thought it would have a sturdier cover and more color photos. The content was very thorough, as far as I could see, but for the price, I would have expected more and better photo images. That's why I gave it only 3 stars. My granddaughter did seem happy with the gift."
5,A Wealth of Information!,"This book may look small, but it is packed with so much helpful information. I grew up on farms with rabbits and *thought* I knew all there was to know concerning them, but I was so wrong! This book offers explanations on rabbit body language (very helpful!) and genreal behavior as well as gives tips on health care, litter training, and introducing a new bunny to your pet cat and/or dog. It explains why rabbits need toys and offers suggestions on what to feed your pet rabbit (and what not to feed him!). This book has really transformed the way I view rabbit care. If you have a rabbit or are considering getting one, please do yourself and your bunny a favor and read this book."
4,"Intermediate, Not for Beginners, OLD!","Large Volume that contains a lot of info but confusing as it keeps sending you to other chapters As it says on the Back coverIt is Intermediate, not for Beginners. Double CD contains most of software you need but partitioning for dual-boot can be difficult.This Book has Become OLD as Red Hat is very Good but not Free anymore and Fedora is the Red Hat Free Distro. I still have the Book but Use Fedora Now."
2,Not as good as the Red Hat Linux Bible,"After going through this book in depth, I found it to be good for starters, but not for more advanced info. Too often, this book punts on difficult subjects and information is not provided in an intuitive order. I greatly prefered Christopher Negus's Red Hat Linux Bible - it's got more true to life examples of what someone like me would go through in day to day use of Linux, as well as more extensive network security information."
1,"BEWARE, Sams Publishing, no customer support!","I bought this book because of the good references. When I opened the CDROM envelop, I found that CD #1 was cracked. I sent the cracked CD #1 to the attention of Assoc. Publisher Mark Taber, Sams Publishing, and kindly asked for a CD #1. This was March 17th, 2003 (it is Aug. 2nd, 2003 now). First it was backorder, than complete silence. No replies to e-mails, and phone calls are any use at all.So beware, if you buy a book with a bad CD from Sams Publishing, you are on your own."
5,A most noteworthy collection,"Even more than the many fine poems cited in this wonderful anthology, I enjoyed the eloquent responses by everyday Americans as to why they responded in certain ways to their favorite poems. These stories are almost as moving as the actual poems and there are dozens of terrific poems, both the familiar and the unexpectedly novel. If you only read the comments, you'd be a richer person, but to read the comments along with the poems, now that's an experience. If this book were required in English classes around the country, maybe kids wouldn't resent poetry units so much!"
1,Skip it.,"This is a poorly thought out and constructed product. The radio fits only with extreme effort, and then badly."
1,HORRIBLE - totally fried my EVO,"This is worse than worthless!! I should have trashed the thing when my phone started behaving strangely while charging (it would freeze up, be slow to respond, etc), but I figured it was nothing. Come to find out, the stupid thing totally trashed my battery in my HTC EVO 3D. I thought the battery had just failed, so I replaced the battery, and that one failed a few weeks later. I FINALLY realized it might be the charger, did some research, and lo and behold. What a disaster!! I had to get a new phone because of this piece of crap."
1,Garbage,I got mine at walgreens one night in a rush because my phone was dead and i didnt have a charger because of verizon selling me the wrong one. Worked great at first. The more i use it the slower it charges. In 2 hours ive gotten 20% of a charge. The blackberry microusb charger amazon sells for $4.50 can get me around 80% in the same amount of time.
1,Waste of MONEY!!!!,"Do not buy one. I purchased mine at a retail store for 15 bucks. It won't even power up the phone to charge it. I don't think they even tested this before the released it to the market. I could take it back, but they will only exchange it for the same item. What a waste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,COMPLETE CRAP,"DO NOT USE JustWireless chargers with your Motorola Droid!!!! Horror stories galore... Just Wireless chargers cause my Droid to completely freeze up while charging on them... And NOW, my Droid is having residual effects from this when not charging. It froze up three times today (wouldn't wake up when I went to unlock the screen - it just remained black and I had to pull the battery out to get it to reboot!)"
1,don't waste your time,all these reviews are right on...this charger is a piece of junk. it burnt out both of my car's a/c outlets! i'm throwing it in the trash or may take it back to Target. Don't waste your time on this supposed 'good deal'.
1,Almost ruined my IPhone!!!,The Just Wireless A/C Portable Charger (SKU 04051) is the worst product I have ever purchased. After charging my IPhone it would not release from it. I had to use a pair of pliers just to pull it away from my phone. It nearly ruined an $800 IPhone.
1,Voltage Too High,"I recently purchased one of these from a display at a large, nationwide discount store. When I plugged it in to an LG Optimus C, Android phone, the display started behaving strangely and the phone started initiating commands. Upon measurement, it would appear the voltage is a full eight volts above specifications! A fault such as this should have never gotten past the most basic QA inspections at the end of the line.This item is going back to the nationwide discount store this evening. I do not normally write gratuitously negative reviews. However, the other reviewers are right. I just wish I had read them before going to buy one of these."
2,"Not For Beginners, No Practical Use","The title of my review sums it up. For a beginner I expected this book to get me up and running, It never did. I read the first 5 chapters and their was way too much focus on the Java code that was created by the JSP engine from a JSP page, and not enough emphasis on how to implement and use JSP. BOOOOH. And there are numerous spelling mistakes, including one on the first page of the introduction. C'mon WROX, wheres your QA/Copywriters? I will return this in exchange for ISBN 1884777996"
2,not clear,"There are a lot of typos in this book. Worse than that, the examples are so long and detailed that it is very difficult to find particular pieces of information. For example, in the explanation of how JSPs interact with javaBeans, there is an excruciatingly detailed example of how to use JSPs, javaBeans, and JDBC. Not that JDBC is unimportant, but it introduces enough extra complexity should not be used to illustrate the above interaction.That being said, the necessary information is mostly there. Perhaps a future revision will be good once they've cleaned it up a bit."
3,Ideal or Idolatry?,"If you are looking to learn from scratch, this is NOT the book for you. If you are an experienced programmer and can fill in the glaring voids in textual presentation, it can be a good reference.JSP is essentially ASP+ as the book was written before the announcement of ASP+, there is only one minor mention of it. It does present a contextual case for JSP and Beans (not EJB!). Beans are essentially components not unlike MS COM components or even OCX's. The good thing in the book is a REAL discussion of encapsulation of business logic as opposed to the other ""pure"" Bean books that prattle on and on with GUI stuff.The book suffers from being disjointed and has a distinctly academic flavor, but if you are experienced with Servlets or classes and know how to JAR and where to deploy, you will find it useful."
2,Coding mistakes take away from this otherwise good book.,"This book is definitely a good book. It contains all sorts of info ranging from EJB to JSP to Connection Pooling. The only thing is that the code examples have a ton of errors in it. That and it always makes references to downloading the source code. You shouldn't have to go and download the code in order to complete an example. So...if you are looking for a book that has the info in it, but not the examples...then this book is for you."
4,Good for reader who has java experience,I think this book is good reference for reader who has experience or has basic java knowledge and used to write server side programming eg. ASP / web applicaton .... For beginner it is hard to learn becouse this book is write for professional but may be undestand if you work hard
2,Thumbs down,"Looks like a different author wrote each chapter, as much of the material is disjoined and lacks a logical flow."
2,Overly verbose!,"The explanations are too wordy. Please be clear and to-the-point. I am a programmer, I need a JSP book that is clear, concise, and yet advance enough to help me reap the full benefits of JSP technology.This writting style seems to be the standard of this Stefan Zeiger et al group. Their last ""red-covered"" book which is ""Professional Java Server Programming"" is VERBOSE! Each book hit over 800 pages. Is that the goal? Well, the books are keeping me in shape.I am sorry guys. I am a terrible writer, myself. But when you produce a ""Professional"" book for programmers, please, put a 110% effort into it."
2,I will not recommand,"Wrox has published some very good books on Java and web development,this book is not one of them.Though the authors have tried to cover everything related with JSP , the explanations about different topics are not very clear,very important topics like Cookies , session tracking etc have not given as much importnace as they deserve.There are some very good books available in the market like ""Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)"" and ""Web Development with Java Server Pages "", I would definitly prefer these books."
2,Too wordy - hard to understand,"I didn't like this book. The examples are hard to follow. Also, it assumes you want to use other technologies like Servlets in conjunction of your JSP pages, which I'm not. API is not organized very well and hard to find things fast. I hope my O'Reilly (on order) is better..."
3,Barnett rakes NU to Pasadena then looks for female kickers,"[...]If your an NU fan you will like this movie because it gives a great look back on the Rose Bowl season. There are a lot of interviews with Darnell Autry (who played w/ the Bears and Eagles before leaving the NFL to go act in gay theatre and Brian Musso who got cut by the J-E-T-S after a training camp many moons ago. Unfortunately, the tape does not include the Rose Bowl itself, which gave NU a serious beatdown at the ahnds of USC and Keyshawn Johnson. However, it's still worth a look if you are a fan.Personally, I think they should have one for NIU's 03 and 04 season."
3,Not for dimmable LED lights,I researched what would be the best dimmer for the Science Lighting LED recessed lights for my bedroom. The 9 dimmable LED lights flicker and buzz at certain light levels. Sometimes out of the blue the lights will dim properly. I don't think it is as much the dimmer as it is the LEDs.
5,Very flavorful - great product,I bought 2 packages of this.I love it! Very flavorful. I use it for cooking and as a table spice instead of salt.Recommend this highly!
4,Sleepwalking is a gem,"Sleepwalking is a great song that sounds like a slightly more mellow Radar Love. It has a great driving funky bass, and some great jazzy saxophone playing at the end. It sounds great, and the version on Second Live is faster and also terrific. Violins is the dud of the album. Nomad is a nice, long, relaxing nighttime song. All in all, this isn't an album to rock out with (except for Sleepwalking), it's more of a mellow, jazzy relaxing album."
4,Who Knows What's Out There?,"This program explored the possibility that remants of the old city of Alexandria were still within reach, just underwater. A team of divers explores the murky waters off Alexandria and finds many tantalizing artifacts, including some which may belong to the Great Lighthouse, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world! Good archaeology program!"
3,"Great soloists, but not the best Chaloff showcase","Two 1954 sessions in Boston produced these tracks, the first with a five-piece group and the second with a nine-piece group. Chaloff and the other soloists (most prominently, Charlie Mariano on alto sax and Herb Pomeroy on trumpet) turn in great performances, but the fidelity leaves something to be desired, especially from the larger group session. Also, five of the 17 tracks are alternate takes that didn't make the cut for my iPod playlist, and neither did the title track, which I found to be an unappealing arrangement. That left me with about 44 minutes of music, which is still a worthwhile assortment for those who thrive on mid-1950s jazz styles. But if it's the best of Chaloff you're after (and better fidelity), pick upBlue SergeandBoston Blow-Up!."
2,Nice product but the metal is kind of weak,This shower caddy has held up well given all the stuff my wife puts on it. However some of the metal pieces have broken off.
5,Tub Caddy,This Caddy fits great inside my tub. It holds all of my shampoos and soaps without taking up to much space.
5,An important survey of the history leading to the evolution of an 'underground alternative gallery',"There are over 177 miles of man-made tunnels and old quarries under the streets of Paris - and they aren't completely abandoned in modern times, but have become a focus for urban culture and art. For over 300 years visitors have chosen these tunnels to comment on events above ground: Caroline Archer & Alexandre Parre's Paris Underground charts both old and new material over the decades, providing an important survey of the history leading to the evolution of an 'underground alternative gallery'. Packed with images and examples, Paris Underground is an essential guide for any who would fully understand ALL the art of Paris."
4,Loved It!,"I loved the three main characters, and that cat. A well written first effort, and I hope to see more books coming from this author."
2,Not LARGE Print,"I recently ordered this bible and was very disheartened to see that the LARGE print was the same as my other bibles. It was a nice bible, but not LARGE print."
1,Not as described,"This bible is not a large print bible it is just normal print, very disappointed and it cost me 9.00 to return it to the USA, overland which takes about 3-4 weeks, the airmail cost would have been 18.00 postage, half the cost of the bible, my advise is to purchase in the UK, or better still find a better large print bible.Eddie TurnerVery let down customer."
3,Bible order,"I ordered one of these bibles (and another, which was a large-print). I received two of these bibles, and the large print never arrived. I had to place a second order to received the large-print bible I (also) ordered, and have no use for the double-order of the first bible."
5,Quality and price,"These are very good quality cables, and the price compared to local store prices, is astounding."
1,This is a scam,"If you buy this Kindle book you do NOT get the Principles of Food Chemistry: Third Edition, which is what is described above. What you get is the Instructor's Manual. That is what the image above shows. It is only a few pages long. It includes quizzes and reading assignments from the full book. This is a scam."
3,Bought it to clean white counters,At the suggestion of a friend I bought this to clean white countertops. Eh. It was fine. I wanted an alternative to the gritty Clorox cleaner with bleach. Since I bought this I finally found liquid Barkeeper's Friend http://www.amazon.com/Bar-Keepers-Friend-Liquid-Cleaner/dp/B001QUT2Q6 which I've been looking for forever. I think I will use that for counters instead.
3,A reasonable approach for new writers.,"Although NLP is debunked as meaningless psycho-babble, this book does offer many good ideas that can help new writers form excellent writing habits. The writing process described isn't anything that you won't find in some other how-to write book on the market, and there are many more that are much more useful. The suggestion that NLP adds anything of value to the writing process devalues an otherwise pretty good book."
1,Bored to Tears!,"I cannot believe I bought this book. I was thrilled with the chance of learning the secrets to UNLOCKING my inner gifts and becoming a better writer but I just found that it took such a major effort on my part to get through it. I liked the description. It motivated me to buy but, this book did not deliver.I understand the power of neuro-linguistics especially, in marketing but I will look elsewhere."
1,skip this product,"We had designed a 6,000 sq ft. house using version 3. We loved the program. But we decided to upgrade to version 5 to get some more advanced features while finalizing the design of the house. What a waste. First, it is not backward compatible so we cannot transfer any of the prior work to it. Second, while it would run on my desktop, it would not run on our laptop. It would crash the system. Their support desk could offer no solutions. Third, where the old program was very intuitive, neither my wife nor I could make any sense out of the new navigation system. She finally uninstalled the new version and went back to the old version. Skip this product."
2,Where are the plants?,"If you use the generic houses and sample lots provided, getting started is easy, but doing the design, and filling in materials will take a while to master. But, where are the plants? I live in Arizona, and from the advertised library of 3500+ plants I found ONE native to the desert, that I could actually use.Despite that frustration I continued, only to find I couldn't print my design. Even after downloading new drivers for sound, video and printer the software crashed. Upside is a 90 day money back guarantee."
1,Most UNINTUITIVE product ever used,"I've been in software development and sales for almost 20 years. This product qualifies as the most unitiutive product I've ever used (going back to DOS days). I've sold very sofisiticated software products that were 100 times easier to use. I can't believe Broderbund trys to sell this as a consumer product. In addition, after working on a design for an hour or so the software would crash and corrupt the file forcing me to recreate my work. Never mind saving your work every few minutes. It didn't matter as it would still corrupt the file. I would highly recommend finding a different solution."
2,Updated but not better,"I designed a 3700 sf. home in 3.0 and am currently living in it. The vector generated graphics of 3.0 were Spartan, but looked three dimensional. And the interface was intuitive. The new version (5.1) is cute and very detailed but appears to be object based and looks like printed paper cutouts - no true 3-D realism - including the (so-called) photo-realistic renderings. It is EXTREMELY hard to master, frustrating to use, and illogical. Hey people at Broderbund - where did you put the SCROLL BARS? The walk through controls are poorly designed, too sensitive and don't allow you to record - at least I haven't found out how to do it. I never tried to print since I went back to 3.0 before finishing my current design. If you have 3.0 and like it, keep it and skip this one."
1,What A Piece Of Garbage!,"Can't add much that hasn't already been said...hard to use, completely counter-intuitive...and the help index and instruction manual are useless. If you type in ""soffit,"" ""beam,"" or ""fireplace"" there aren't even entries with corresponding instructions! Also, where are commands for crown molding, baseboard, etc? I'll stick with Version 3, which is a much easier-to-use product and offers more features."
1,Home Design?,"This product should have never seen the light of day. I have used prior versions, but this one has forgotten all those lessons. Save your money and buy a pencil and ruler - it will be faster and more accurate."
3,Crack cream is o.k.,"Does not last very long, but still good for dry feet when you live in the desert, dry areas.D Webster"
2,Smelly,This product is smelly and doesn't work well either. There are better choices. Flexitol heel balm works great and doesn't stink.
1,Won't buy again,"I bought this for my dry cracked feet from reading reviews. I certainly won't be buying it again. It is extremely watery and smells like an odd mixture of medicinal licorice. Totally disappointed...not sure how this is supposed to heal dry cracked heels when it is like applying stinky water to your feet. I haven't noticed any better results than from any other lotion...and I later it on at bedtime and put on socks...once it is gone, I will go back to any other lotion I many pick out at the store-anything has got to smell better!"
3,Not for Beginners or poor eyesight,"Beautiful photographs and some very nice patterns. But, the graphs are printed so light and small that a trip to the Copy shop is a must. The book is also loaded with errors. Be very very sure to check the publishers website to get corrections. I think less fluff, garden shots, bigger and darker charts and maybe a bit of written directions would improve this book 100%If you are a beginner lace knitter, I would put off buying this book. There are better and easier to work pattern books out there."
4,"A beautiful book, HOWEVER","The long awaited A Gathering of Lace is truly a beautiful book containing so many projects that you just have to make that it will be hard to decide which one to knit first.However, be aware that there are NUMEROUS errors in the charts and directions in the first edition. Before knitting anything it would be prudent to check the publisher's website for revisions and corrections. If not for the large number of errors, I would have given this book five stars."
3,check for corrections to avoid frustration!,"I've made several of the projects in this book, and I am looking forward to making more. It has beautiful patterns. But, I would have saved myself a lot of frustration and ripping out if I'd checked first for corrections to mistakes in the directions and charts before beginning my first project. All of the patterns I chose to make have had substantial mistakes in both charts and written instructions. A four page pdf of necessary fixes is available online, but I still lowered my rating of this book - the sheer number of mistakes is inexcusable for an expensive book produces by experience knitters. And they should have been corrected before reprinting - my copy is the fourth printing, still with the same mistakes."
4,Extremely pleased!,"Contrary to what others have said, I knit my first ""real"" lace shawl from this book - the Faux Russian Stole. I found the pattern very easy to follow so long as you pay attention. I am planning on knitting at least two other projects from this book, I love it so much! As for errata, it's wise to check for mistakes in ANY knitting book before you begin. Since I work in the book industry, I know that the pattern may be perfect when it goes to the printer, but errors sometimes occur and are out of the control of the designer in most cases.I would have liked a little more background on each shawl, but otherwise I am very happy with this book and will keep knitting from it for some time."
5,Lovely Laces,"I have not knitted anything from this book yet, but find it a lovely selection of lace patterns and designs for the experienced knitter. The patterns are completely graphed, and the items range from shawls, stoles and shrugs to purses, socks and pillows. It shows the marvelous inventiveness of our present day needle workers."
5,Beautiful!!!,"This is a collection of lots of different knitters shawls, it is NOT all Meg Swansen shawls,so for this reazon is a GREAT book, with beautiful and delicate shawls, worth the price!!"
4,I wish....,"I wish that I had read the reviews before I started knitting because ,yes, there are errors in the charts.It is a LOVELY book however and I enjoy just looking at it. I will go to the website before I start another project..."
4,Not the book for lace knitting novices!,"This is the most beautiful book I've seen on lace but not matter how hard I tried, I could not follow the charts. It is an inspiration but if a beginner tries this, it's a bit of a disappointment.I'll enjoy the book and peruse it and hope that one day I'll understand what they're talking about in their instructions."
5,Practical lace projects that I can use,"I've already made a couple of the small items in the little laces section. The patterns are easy to figure out, with a good combination of written directions and charts. I got this at the same time as the Folk Shawls book by Cheryl Oberle. Both are good, but this one has many more items that aren't just shawls or scarves. It has socks, hats, a Real purse, some very cut gloves.And, the photography is absolutely beautiful."
3,Design could be better...,"after all, you're paying enough for this thing. The plastic makes it hard to use the touch pad. When working out, the Velcro has a tendency to come undone. I adore my Zen, but this thing makes me wonder if I should get something different for working out only."
5,Wonderful!!!!,I loved this book fom the first time I read it. And it gets better each time I read it again. Joshsa and Naomi HOT HOT HOT and passion through the roof. My only regret is that it had to end and could not continue on for another twenty chapters.
4,A must for collectors,The Flaming Pie album was released with many singles and many versions of each singles. Compiling them all creates practically an entire album's worth of additional material. These b-sides are mostly a mixture of Flaming Pie era songs and older 80s songs that didn't make it to completion at the time for various reasons. Beautiful Night Pt. 1 isn't as strong as Pt. 2 but still very rewarding for McCartney fans. The title track is perhaps the strongest on the album and the 80's version found in the Oobu Joobu portion of the disc helps show the genesis of the song as McCartney worked to find a suitable sound for the music. Love Come Tumbling Down is an island infused ballad from 1987 that has a very pleasant melody but has a somewhat quirky pace.
5,Worth Reading,"Too often, people who write about education think only of the test scores, and approve only of the most boring approaches to learning. It's important to read books like this one, so that a parent or teacher keeps their sights set on having school be better for the next generation."
2,Close-mindedness,"Before you critique of this book, be sure you have read E. D. Hirsh's ""The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them."" But, don't be guilty of being so open-minded that your brain falls out!Kohn presents little evidence for his opinions when compared to the historical evidence and research that is presented by Hirsh. While many of Kohn's views seem logical, they fly in the face of fact. However, while Hirsh's views seem supported by fact, they often extrapolate the actual evidence into questionable deductions.This reader finds the evidence presented by these two authors to support a philosophy that supports many of the ideas of both authors, but gravitates toward that of E. D. Hirsh's. The truth seems to stand in a ""progressivist"" approach to relatively standardized ""back-to-basics"" ideals.Read with a critical eye!"
1,Hazard to Your Ciild's Brain!,Another repackaging of the progressive reforms that have destroyed American education. Facts are bad. We just need to think critically. Now *that* is a good trick if you don't have command of facts!Read Hirsch instead if you really want to understand the anti-intellectual underpinning of progressive education.
5,Great! A must read book.,"Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi, and Fluddur Fflam are back in anotherenchanting fantasy in the land of Prydain as described inThe Book of Three.The companions set out on a journey todestroy the Black Crochan,a cauldron used to make cauldron-born zombies. Packed with action, wisdom, and courage, thisis an excellent read for Princesses of Llyr, bards, princesand Assistant Pig Keepers the same."
5,Best of the best,The first time I read the entire book is a great job I liked it gives you the best taran
4,Black Cauldron,"First fantasy-style book I ever read... and it still has me enthralled. I do see more in it than I did in middle school, and it reads faster, but overall it is a wonderful story. Another step of how a young boy grows into a man, and so quickly through events that are so much bigger than he."
5,Even better than The Book of Three!!!,"Lloyd Alexander does it again! He's at the top of his storytelling form here with new characters that you'll always remember, and plenty more action, adventure, and humor.In my opinion, this book was worthy of the Newberry Award, no questions asked! If you read The Book of Three, read this one; you're gonna' like it better than the prequel!"
4,It is a must read book!!!!,"There are many characters in this book I will tell you some of the main characters. Taran, an assistant pig keeper, and Dallban, Taran's guardian/leader throughout the book. The story starts in early Autumn. Taran is doing his chores when along comes a very important knight. This is not very good news. There are already many brave knights and loyal kings awaiting his company in Dallbans house. There is a very evil king out to get the the black cauldron. But if the cauldron falls into the wrong hands, then very bad things are ahead. In the middle of the book Taran ends up getting the cauldron, and never lets it go.In the end to wrap the whole story up Taran becomes a hero. I loved this book, and I encourage you to read it."
2,DJ,I like the Black Cauldron because it is kind of interesting. I like Gurgi because he is like a four year old that knows how to talk a little. Gurgi fought the worriers to get the cauldron. I liked the book a little bit because it is something to read to get your mind off of things.
3,I did not enjoy the story as much as the book of three,"Imagine a mission to find something nearly impossible, accompanied by a girl, a hairy thing named Gurgi, and a harp player named Fflewdder Flam who over exaggerates. Well In the Black Cauldron it does have all of that in the book. Taran has to trade his broach to get a black crochin, but the witches said ok we will trade, but most of the stuff was too valuable. So Taran trades his brooch, for the Crochin. Then later in the story the jealous prince Ellidyr the son of Pen-Llarcau came and threw him in the river and took it.I did not enjoy the story as much as the first one. I did not like the beginning of it or the middle of it. I thought it was boring because they were always arguing. But I did like the part when Gurgi broke loose from his captors and flung himself toward the king."
2,kk,I did not like the Black Cauldron book because it was not very good. It was very odd. The part I did not like was when Taran was a pig boy. He had met Gurigi but he did not want to be his friends so that part was crazy. The book reminded me of the Harry Potter books because of all the stuff about friendship. The Black Cauldron was based on friendships and I don't like books like that. That is why I think the book was weird.
1,baby doll,I did not like the Black Cauldron because it was not interesting. Also I did not like it because their characters were fake. I didn't think the characters were believable. I didn't like the way they acted and talked. Also they had too many things going on!!!!!!!
5,Have you ever wondered about magic,"Have you ever wondered about magic? A lot of people do wonder. In Prydain a lot of characters are supernatural. There are enchanters like Dallbon and enchantresses like Eilonwy. There are dark magic woods, magical objects like spellingsticks grass nets, wands and baubles. There is evil. Great evil like Achren. So Prydain is full of supernatural beings. Most of the supernatural beings use their power for good and to protect their family and their homes from people like Achren.I liked The Black Cauldron because it has a lot of adventure. Because I like to go on adventure because some adventures are highly dangerous like mountain climbing is dangerous. There are a lot of other dangerous adventures but there are to many to list. I also liked it because of Eilonwy -- she knows how to take care of herself -- she's strong magic and cool! The girl has all the moves. I think she could beat up Taran like Taran was a stick."
4,Another Good Installation for a Fantastic Series,"I now understand why this is considered a classic, this is as amazing as the first and lives up to its name of Prydain!!! The characters are as great as ever, the plot is twisted and very interesting, the antagonist is on the move again, and I was jumping for joy and crying sadly at the same time. This book is totally worth the read and I recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy and want to read a good book!"
5,a fflam! a fflam!,"The Black Cauldron is a fantastic book (NOT like the movie AT ALL ^_^)Taran hasn't learned his lesson from the Book of Three, or if he did he forgot it, but that is ok because FFLEWDDUR RETURNS! YAY!(Is it broken? No, not my arm, the HARP!) Fflewddur really got the short end of the stick in the movie, though...Anyway, in all seriousness, it is the supporting characters who really make this book (well, the whole series, really, but The Black Cauldron in particular)so special. It is a bit darker that The Book of Three (a pattern throughout the series, each a little darker than the next as Taran grows up) and the Companions are tested more sorely, but it means each gets the chance to shine a little brighter.(A Fflam is valiant! ::twang!:: Drat...)In conclusion...read it. It will not disappoint."
1,A Disappointing Experience,"Noticing this product reminded me of similar products I recall being sold in the 1980's. After receiving the item I was very disappointed because the product itself as well as the box the product arrived in appeared used. Scuff marks were on the black casing in numerous areas. The box itself appeared old and worn. In fairness I cannot evaluate how well the product functioned because I absolutely will not use a personal product which appears to have been used. In fact, even though I was sent a replacement I promptly returned both items, unable to even want to open the box and examine the replacement unit."
3,"Horribly, horribly dated","This book may have been OK two years ago, but today it shows why you no longer see Magic books: they have limit shwlf life. All the book covers is 7th Edition and the Invasion block and the Odyssey block expansions. Most of the information given is either outdated, or can be gained by reading anything else on the 'net or elsewhere about Magic. It's sorta neat as a historical document, but don't get this otherwise. It is now for collector's only."
5,Excellent book!,"Thank you guys for an excellent book! I have been developing applications for IIS for many years and think you have done a great job in explaining how it all works. I also very much like the ""reality check"" concept. Keep up the good work!"
3,Your A** is Covered is rude,"It is a practical book.Each chapter is lacking of coherent.I still feel there are more elegant ways than ""Your A** is Covered"".It is better to have scenario to illustrate why this should be used or done."
3,Badly In Need of a Reissue,"This is my favorite Springsteen album bar none!I love every track on it and anyone at all interested in rock n roll owes it to themself to own a copy. That being said, this CD BADLY needs a 30th annv. reissue with remastering and all the trimmings. It deserves such treatment.Currently, this is a 5-star album on a 3-star CD."
4,Definitely in his top 3,"This is without a doubt one of Springsteen's best efforts. It's an extremely solid album and it's classic Bruce at his most rockin'. It also has marginally better guitar work than most of what he's put out. But what I think makes this album so effective is how pretty much everyone can relate to experiences expressed by the boss in these songs, and even though there are still many refrences to cars and what not, it's a very emotional and powerful album. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Springsteen."
4,"Prove it all night, prove it all night","Wile it might not be The E-street bands best album, it still will make people who might evan hate the name bruce love his music. My fave song on this album is badlands, and all the others realy come close to being his best songs. Take it from me, and buy this album!"
4,Poignant,"Not an incredible album by any stretch of the imagination, but Bruce Springsteen showed his talent for insightful lyrics in every song on the album. From the title track's haunting main character who lost everything when his past all caught up with him to the hopefulness of a new life and the despair of a ruined life in Racing In The Street, Bruce is absolutely poetic. In the telling story of the lastdraw in Badlands, Bruce reveals all his capabilities. In the rocker Prove It All Night, he shows why he is the Boss. Perhaps the most trying and beautiful tune is Something In The Night, another song about hope and faith and destiny which turns the wrong way. Bruce Springsteen may not have had his masterpiece here, but it was very well done to say the least, and the highpoints of the album are highpoints of his career."
5,Raging Against The Machine...,"This album literally changed my life...and probably saved it. Anyone who is 15 and has more pentup rage towards parents, school and life in general than a rabid Pit Bull can relate to the immeasurable resentments that live in ""Badlands,"" ""Something In The Night,"" ""Adam Raised A Cain"" and the title song. Just knowing that someone - ANYONE - knew what I was going through was enough to keep me going through the psychological field of land mines that is adolescence.Many people have criticized this album as being to emotionaly overwrought. I disagree - Springsteen's point here is that part of livng a successful life is to feel things with passion. The older I get, the easier it is for me to forget this valuable, hard-earned lesson. I need to listen to this album more often, and ANYONE who loves rock & roll needs to hear it at least once! Buy this album!"
5,Love A Howling Bruce!!,"I bought this album when it first came out. Didn't like it. Put it on the shelf for about 4 months and then took it down and started listening to it. The more I listened, the more I loved it. This is Bruce and the E Street Band at its best. What I love about Bruce is his Vocals, his howling and his songwriting. Bruce howls on this record. The writing is beautiful and makes me remember why I loved Springsteen in the first place. I have been playing this CD all summer and it is so America - the America I am proud to know and the America that is disappearing...In my opinion, Bruce's best album. Racing in the Streets my favorite, but Badlands, Promised Land, Prove It All Night, a howling Bruce on Something In The Night, Streets of Fire and the title track Darkness on the Edge of Town reign as some of his best...get it!!"
5,Simply the best rock and roll album I have ever heard.,"While others Springsteen albums may be better known by the casual fan, i.e. Born in the USA, Born to Run, this is his piece de resistance. From the outstanding cover track, to the incredible Prove It All Night, to the rocking Promised Land and finally to the vastly underrated Racing in the Street, along with the other tracks of which there are no weak sisters, rather far from it, this is the best record ever made."
5,Springsteen's 1978 Masterpiece,"This may be the best album I've ever heard by any artist. The power & passion captured on this album is remarkable. Bruce's lyrics are raw, angry, and tender all at once, and he delivers these songs with a conviction and intensity that will leave you exhausted. The title track is arguably his greatest song ever. A masterpiece."
5,1 of bruces greatest cds,"We should be able to buy this on it's own.Instead in the dvd/cd pakage.The sound is updated and it really rocks.They really should put ""the promise"" and ""don't look back"" on this cd.The two songs added on would have made darkness a better record."
5,The best of a very strong portfolio of talent.,"I can still remember the day I bought this LP in 1978. In my opinion Bruce's strongest LP - dark, menacing and powerful. There isn't one weak song on the LP. Personal favourites are: Bad Lands, Darkness on the Edge of Town. But to pick out individual tracks is unnecessary. If you've never heard this LP, buy it and enjoy it!"
2,not new,"ordered two cassettes represented as new that were not new. just because you have a shrink wraper and know how to use it does not mean something magicly becomes new.ordered 8 others from different sellers, all were new."
1,no cd remaster?! shocking!!,"I share some of the other reviewers' frustrations. This great (Darkness...) album was WAY overdue for a remastering but Sony/Columbia only provided a big price tag box set or mp3 download (which is inferior). The album and cd should ALWAYS be made affordably available and as a ""stand-alone"" product!!! Its not only tradition, but standard, customary practice; and, ""good business sense""! It also shows respect and consideration for the consumer and Bruce fans. Its hard to believe that Bruce would allow this."
4,Pretty good for a Left wing zealot,This was the Boss when he wasn't being political and his music touched all of us in a special way.
5,the best of them all,Darkness on the edge of town reminds me more of the life ive seen and the people ive known than anything else. factory is as real as it gets. this has diffrent imagry than the first3. racing in the street is my favorite.the guitar is penatraitng on adam raised acain streets of fire candysroom is great badlands promisedland prove itallnight are good rock. darkness and something in the night are emotional. to me darkness is the best rock cd ever it tells the story of the time with class and emotion.
5,Springsteen's best,"The cover photos for this album symbolize what it's all about. On the front, Springsteen wears that emblematic ""Born to Run"" black leather jacket, as seen on the cover of the previous record that made him an overnight superstar. On the back, the famous stud-leather is gone; the Boss is stripped down to a plain white T.For all its success, to my ears ""Born to Run""'s songs are often sentimental and even phony: the record pumps up banal, everyday stories into unconvincing epics with comic book melodrama and unlistenably hyper-inflated wall-of-sound bombast. It doesn't stand the test of years well, IMO.But ""Darkness"" is its shadowy obverse. More banal, everyday life-stories, yet made powerfully compelling by simple, honest, confessional story-telling and gritty, stripped-down musical arrangements that keep you close to the bones of some of Springsteen's sharpest, loveliest songwriting.""BTR"" is unconvincingly overpowering; ""Darkness"" is shattering, unforgettable. Not to be missed!"
2,Hot Legs,"Cassie Hill swore off men, but when a priceless painting goes missing, she needs the help of one to recover the stolen art. The one who is most equipped to help her with that problem is the one man who can help her with the main one, fear of love. Bobby Serre can not only spot a forgery a mile off, he can spot a beautiful woman, like Cassie, whom he dubs Hot Legs. Together, they navigate the dangerous world where art thieves lurk and the dangers of romance. Even as they try to recover the stolen painting, they steal each others' hearts.....................Though fast paced, the plot occassionally wanders, getting lost in the soft eroticism of the lovers' romance. However, those who prefer that will be well pleased."
3,Plus and Minuses of IBoom Bag,"As a whole, this bag is great. It provides you a way to carry this boom box that really doesn't have a handle. It also has additional pockets for other accessories. There are two small mishaps in this bag...the fit is extremely tight(very difficult to get the box in and out). Second is the fact that there is no opening for the powercord to come through(this means that you have to remove the boom box from the bag in order to plug it up). Anytime you travel with IBoom and bag you will need to remove it to gain AC power."
2,Mechatonics,"This book is flawed, even in its second editon, due to typos and outright errors in some places. Chapter 14 dealing with digital logic has a noticable error for the exclusive or operation: A XOR B = A OR Not(B). This is not correct! I lose faith in a textbook when I see things like this!!!"
5,High Quality book,"I'm very impressed by this book. I got both this and the Clicker-training book and this one is quite a bit better. It goes into much greater depth for teaching a lot more tricks. It also unfortunately has a lot of ""filler"", but the training info is very helpful."
2,A little disappointed,"I had read one of Karen Pryor's clicker training books but was trying to train a cat and she provided lots of good generic clicker training guidance, but I needed something more specific to a cat. I read lots of reviews before ordering this book and most people were satisfied-it got better reviews than Karen Pryor's cat training book so I went ahead and got it. In the end I had better luck just applying Karen Pryor's theories to training my cat as this book doesn't provide much specific clear step by step instruction and the techniques it did provide weren't very useful. If I could get half my money back in exchange for the book, I would take it. Recommend reading Karen Pryor's books-they're a lot more in-depth, scientific and interesting. You will learn a lot more about what makes your pet do the things it does and how to control it's behaviors-to some degree-you know a cat is still a cat no matter how much training you provide or kitty cookies you bribe it with!"
2,Nothing I couldn't intuit...,Save your money. Just buy a clicker and check out a dog training book from the library. It's the same information.
1,This software is junk,"I just installed this software thinking that for $19.99 (a $10 discount) it is worth the risk even given the bad reviews. Unfortunately, this software is not worth 19 cents. The program crashed 4 times with runtime errors just trying to do a simple thing like change the dimensions of a site boundary. Save yourself the frustration, and save your money."
2,Very Difficult to Use,"My husband and I are both college educated (my husband is an electrical engineer for a high tech company) and we are struggling to use this product. It takes a lot of work to get a landscape set up and seems more appropriate for landscape professionals. The plant encyclopedia pictures are not very clear and there does not appear to be a search mechanism within the encyclopedia. We consider the cost a waste of money and are disappointed that we can't return the product. We will be designing our yard with pen, paper and plant encyclopedias easily found on the internet."
2,Too complicated !,"I am very computer literate, I run a sophisticated accounting package and a customer management database program at work, along with the usuals Microsoft Excel, Word, Access. And alot more. But THIS software is just too much. I bagged it once i realized that just learning how to use it could take up a whole weekend.... I had the same problem with 3D Home Architect 5.0... I loved version 3.0, it took awhile to learn 4.0 but so worth it... and I can't make heads or tails of version 5.0. Bruderbund people! Why are you forsaking us?"
2,Not User Friendly,"This software gives you seemingly endless options, which is both good and bad. Good because you can micromanage down to the texture of the bricks in the pathway of your garden, but bad because these powerful tools only get a few lines of explaination in the user's manual. I consider myself to be fairly computer savvy, but the program makes it difficult for you even to join fences to the house properly or add slope to your terrain. I'll spend several more hours trying to see if I can make any progress in learning this program, but I don't think you should have to have a CAD degree just to design some landscape on a computer."
5,Love the game!,This was a great gift for my husband! We both love Duke! It's such a great twist to a classic family game.
5,Robert gordon- Is red hot,"Robert gordon is unknown rockabilly king, for too many people. this cd ""is red hot"" is good anthology his music.If you hear it,you know what i,m talking about."
4,cheery addition,I had been using an old ironing board cover for years and this new one is quite a relief. It stays put well and the colorful design makes even ironing a cheery experience.
1,Save your money,This movie is to outdated and shows nothing if it wasn't outdated. The title is return to the Titanic but they never were there in the first place. This is a 1981 movie and the Titanic was not discovered until 1985.
5,SPICE GIRLS-TOO MUCH,This single is one of the best I have ever listened to. Seeing as how the Spice Girls were such a succesful group and they are unfortunately no longer together this single will just grow in worth. I success purchasing this Spice Girls single while you still can.
4,Dazzers tip,it's overall a very good game with a good story all the way through. as you sneak and battle through countless maps to uncover a conspirisy that has lasted year's. I think this would be a five star game if it were not for the ultra hard boss leading to the worst end sequence ever...
4,"Cool Pictures, Cool Book","This book has very colorful pictures and the price guide is extremely accurate. This is one of the best PEZ books ever. If you collect, get this book today!"
3,a new cover.......wow,"This is the same as all the last. Prices have changed some but they really arent to acurate. If you have any other edition stick with it. The only difference here is a few ""new"" pics and a new cover...whoopie....This 4th edition could have been much better but falls way short. Only purchase this if you are brand spankn new to pez collecting or if you lost your older edition"
4,A very diverse collection of soundscapes,"This is a relatively new release from the ""Pot Head Pixies"" and the line-up contains original founder and space-poet Daevid Allen! Musically, this album is a multidimensional affair, mixing jazz-rock with acoustic guitars, techno-rhythms and squeaky saxophones. As a consequence, this album is too uncohesive and too long to make it one of their legendary and best-known works such as ""Flying Teapot"" or ""Angel's Egg"". But ""Shapeshifter"" sounds amazingly fresh and delightful, and you get a lot of tracks for your money. So if you want to know, how these old hippies could survive 30 years on the music scene, you should purchase ""Shapeshifter""!"
3,LIKE IT BUT.,LIIKE THE PODUCT BUT WOULD LIKE IT A LOT MORE IF IT WERE THICKER AND STAYED WHERE YOU PUT IT. IT MOVES EASILY. CAN'T IMAGINE HOW TO WEAR IT SUCCESSFULLY. IT'S A PITY BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS IT IS OR COULD BE SO USEFUL.NOT.
3,"Check out their next release ""The Mill"" instead...","This is the beginning. As with most bands who have something special-the process takes some maturing as an artist. This album, posesses overall good music. However, the singer is about to find his voice by their next album. Really, if I had heard this album back in 2002 when it came out, this band would have been on my radar to watch out for. It's their next album ""The Mill"" from 2005 which is much closer to a masterpiece."
4,Looks even better in person.,Looks really good in person and it was easy to assemble. Works great as a hope chest for my fiance.
2,It might work....if,"It might work if you could grab the hair. The tweezer mechanism is very flimsy and quickly loses its ""grabbing"" power. You have to squeeze the tweezer device so tight that it will sooner or later cause the plastic to crack."
1,Didn't work for me,"First, its really boring and unmotivating to use this product as you have to switch off the radio/TV etc, before using it.Second, its very tedious.If it was effective, it would have probably been worth the effort, but the hair wouldn't come off after more than 20 seconds of holding.Didn't work for me. I gave up after several tries.Jay"
2,This is all we have to show for 100 years?,"I have to admit, I didn't check the number of pages when I ordered. I assumed that for almost 30 bucks I would be getting a comprehensive history of Syracuse basketball. What I got was a book that is much too short and lacks adequate detail. Entire stretches of 2-4 years are skipped, even in the Mid-80s! No articles concerning Pearl's shot to beat BC in '85. No articles about Lawrence Moten breaking scoring records. I hope the next person that tries this book does it right!"
2,Small and Light - On Both Sound and Size,"I purchased this speaker to take on trips with my buddies so that we could share our music. It has a nice, compact design with a flip down cover that becomes the stand for the speaker. Unfortunately, the distortion from the speaker at anything over 2/3 volume from my iPod touch is totally unacceptable. To play distortion free music the volume output makes it more of a personal amplification system and not enjoyable by a group. Although I gave the design high marks, the low quality of sound drags the overall review down."
5,just what I needed,"this was a great speaker to purchase, I got if so that I can listen to my zune mp3 player at work in my office, it small and sits fright on my desk"
3,Speaker system review,"The system is not a good as I originally thought. The system is nice and compact, but the sound from the speakers can be barEly heard unless you turn up the volume alot."
5,Perfect for on-the-go moms!,"I purchased these on a whim (as with most of my Amazon buys!) thinking they would be nice for snack time in my busy household. The kids and I both are crazy about them! They're the perfect size for a 4 or 5 year old's snack. They're also easy enough to open that my 4 and 5 year olds can open the package themselves. Our favorite variety is of course chocolate. Love having these around for trips to the zoo, on the way to the store, or to throw in the lunchbox. Will be buying these again!"
4,"Love the variety snack pack, but price is too high","My kids LOVE these things. They are so convenient too. I really like to order from Amazon, because it is so convenient... but watch the price on these little babies. I originally bought these in Sept 2011 for under seven dollars. 2 months later the price is over 14. Really?! I can appreciate inflation, but this kind of price increase is robbery!"
4,A great reference,"This book is not for the casual reader. If the contents seems confusing at times it is because there are hard problems being analyzed. Any book on algorithms that is not confusing at times is probably not discussing any interesting algorithms. While quite academic, this book is also relevant to any engineer who needs to design/optimize a non-trivial algorithm. It's also one of those books that one can open up to any random page and start reading. Sometimes when I get coders-block, this is just the thing to break me out of it. This book is heavy, expensive and well worth its weight and price."
2,Overhyped garbage,"If you're looking to LEARN algorithms this is not the book for you. The authors' writing style is excruciatingly verbose and the structure is haphazard. I do not understand why algorithms exhibiting similar techniques (e.g. dynamic, greedy, etc) are not clustered together. Another peeve is the fact that critical parts of proofs and explanations are left to the reader. And of course, there is no solution manual available to the public.So if you would like to learn algorithms, please check out Anany V. Levitin's book. Although his writing style may be considered simplistic he conveys the information in a style suitable for learning. I hope the authors (CLRS) will one day realize that simplicity is elegant."
5,Fantastic algorithms book,"This is one of the few books that I've kept from my undergrad days as a computer science major. Although I haven't been doing software development in a while, I still use it for reference once in a while. It's easy to understand and timeless reference book. I work for a large DoD company and quite a few of my co-workers have this book on their shelves as well. (We all went to different colleges.)"
2,Too much and too little,+ Defacto standard+ Accompanying WebCourse- Too deep if used as an intro book; lacks solutions if used for a reference book- It's HUGE!; hard to carry around= Tries to appease too wide an audience. Definately attractive to professors who already know the information and feel this is THE book yet probably too deep for an intro algorithms class. Wish there was a searchable pdf version that came with the book on a CD as well as odd numbered solutions.
4,Complex Topics. Not so Complex Book.,"If any book is being worshipped for it's content on Algorithms in Academia, then it is this book. I have used this book both in my undergraduate and my Masters and definitely the best in the field.But, I personally think the topics covered are complex to begin with. So, it takes this book and couple of books for reference to understand the topics completely. If you want to develop new efficient algorithms, then this is the book to begin with. Over all a very good book. Would definitely recommend it."
2,Not easy to understand,"Although there is some great analysis of algorithms in this text, the text does not do a very good job of TEACHING one how to perform the analysis. I really did not like the fact that answers to the exercises are not available anywhere. I learn best by seeing examples done step by step and this book does not provide any solutions or even offer a separate solutions text. The authors seem to feel that the instructor should provide solutions, well I don't know about other Universities, but my professor does not provide solutions in class and the TAs are not very strong with this type of difficult material. Which leaves me to scour the Internet and other texts to try and understand the topics when I could have gained the same understanding by examining the solutions to the exercises."
4,Comprehensive and (almost) complete.,"I am an EE PhD student in Princeton, with basic CS background. I bought this book about a week ago, and I just finished reading more than half of it. I am impressed by the organisation and dedication of the authors to write something understandable to a wide audience, without sacrificing in depth analysis. If you need a good and complete introductory book, that summarizes also the latest research in the field, I would recommend this one.Drawbacks...Minor (+ I am a weird guy) and hardly mentionable, but I have the feeling that some proofs may have been presented more rigorously. I would also like to see more examples or SOLUTIONS to some of the problems."
5,Good coverage,"This book delivers what every programmershould know.1) How to reason,analyse,determine algorithm efficiency"
4,THE Algorithms Book,"This is widely considered the one algorithms book that every computer science should read. It covers a wide variety of algorithm topics from sorting to graph algorithms to NP completeness. It contains detailed descriptions of dozens of algorithms as well as complexity analysis for many of them. The book's biggest shortcoming in my opinion is the relatively high number of items that are left as an exercise for the reader, with no answers included. These items make for great problem sets in a classroom setting, but detract from the book's utility as a reference."
4,"Still ""the"" reference, still errors","The book is, as long as I know, the standard for introductive algorithms courses. And one can easily understand why, since it is complete and authoritative. An encyclopedic good work that deserves respect and a good reviews.I'd gladly give a five stars rate, but it seems that this book must chronically suffer the annoying disease of bugs and printing errors. It was so in the first edition and it seems it is going exactly the same way in this second edition. Just go to the MIT Press web site and check the impressive (since we are just at the sixth month of life ...) bug reports list."
5,good condition,"this book was kept up...no pages missingwas a great deal for me, it beats buyin the book for full price"
3,Faily good timely delivery,I received the book in a fairly good amount of time. I will just note that this book did not come with it's companion CD. I expected it to have it's companion cd. There was not mention as to whether or not the book had it's companion cd.
1,Extreemly confusing book,"If you are a person who eats, sleeps, and dreams about algorithms, then this book is for you. However, if you are an average student interested in programming, and want to get a good understanding of this subject matter, don't buy this one. The authors of this book do a very poor job of explaining even the most basic concepts, and seem to think the people reading this book are high-level graduate students. There are few examples, and fewer explanations. We have two teachers teaching this stuff at my school, one of which has a doctorate in CS, and both of them are having a hard time explaining this stuff to us.KEEP AWAY !!!!"
4,"great reference, bad teacher","This wouldn't be the book I'd choose for an introductory algorithms class; it's a bit dense at times. However, it's an excellent reference, one of the few textbooks i've kept and will make use of."
2,Confusing to say the least,"This book does not provide enough examples to really get the ideas across. It is a thick read that provides little help to the subject matter unless the reader already has a wealth of knowledge on mathematical proofs and algorithms to begin with.If the book had a solution manual, or at least explained many of the things that occur in the problem sections that never show up in the actual reading, then it would be a much easier to understand textbook."
3,good condition but not sure about the content,"I just found the book I bought is a eastern economy edition which is released in India. thus not sure whether the content would be the same with that of the U.S. edition, book is in good condition though."
2,Good for programming; high mathematic entry level,"This book is readable. I gave it two stars because of how I feel: the alt text reads ""I don't like it.""I tried with significant effort to read and understand this book. It does not give an in depth explanation of analysis, in my case, of recurrence. It does not describe any strategy to begin in a useful manner. It gives few examples with limited explanation. It does not provide any sample problem/solution breakdowns. All of which I feel would benefit my learning methods greatly.If this book had an introduction to ""Introduction to Algorithms""..."
2,"very detailed, few examples","This book contains lots of information, but examples are few and far between and there is no student solutions manual for the exercises. If you want more practice or are having trouble grasping something, tough. you will have to look elsewhere. I bought this book for an algorithms class. I ended up finding more useful information on the internet. For $80, I expect more. I would suggest that the authors keep the student in mind when writing their next textbook."
3,Too detailed...,"I was disappointed by this book. The coverage of the subject is exhaustive and encyclopedic. But I think that the pseudo code to explain algorithms were poorly done and difficult to follow in many cases. For instance in their tree code they included pointers to parents for each node, I think this is unnecessary in most cases and befuddles the pseudo code. It seems that the authors were saying ""We're going to include every single detail in this explanation so that it's perfect"", when in fact they should have been saying ""how do we make this explanation concise and understandable"" A clear case of seeing the trees and not the forest."
3,"good reference, but certainly *not* an introductory textbook for students","(1) i have taken courses that use this book(2) i have taught students from this bookin both cases the book was not useful. the professor provided online notes as a supplement to the book because, frankly, the book is opaque at times and not at the level of an introductory course.in case (2), when i actually interacted with students trying to learn the material, i found that students just had a lot of trouble understanding many sections of the text.i own this book because i do a lot of work on algorithms and it's good to have on the bookshelf, ready to grab. but i don't think people should teach from it, nor should the casual student of algorithms own it. instead, there are much better teaching books. the new Kleinberg and Tardos book is a great example of a book that's good for teaching."
4,Gently Teaches Youngsters to Share,"As BabyBop finds herself in many situations with her adorable friends, she learns that she can share her most treasured possession. Our son received this gift before the birth of his first baby brother. What we like most about it is that BabyBop discovers on her own that she can share.With its typical ""Barney"" style, the characters are gentle and respectful of one another. BabyBop is not coerced into sharing nor is she told that she must share ""or else"".It is a great book, particularly timely when a new sibling is on the way."
2,"Munsingwear customer for many years, up until the last order..","purchased 5 3-pack vneck men's munsingwear t-shirts, similar experience to others -- most of the t-shirts were similar to the quality I've expected and received for years from this brand, except for 2 of the t-shirts that were 1-2 sizes smaller - as in skintight and 5 inches shorter than all the rest. Marked ""L"", but nowhere near that in size. Researching other brands now; hate to switch, and the price is fine, but I'm looking for quality similar to what munsingwear used to offer."
1,"Seconding ""Honest Review""","I second everything ""Honest Review"" said about these shirts. My husband also wore this kind of Munsingwear shirt for years and loved them. All of a sudden, the ""tags"" disappeared, the ""label"" was printed on the back of the shirt, and the shirts now shrink in length something like 3 inches ... and that is just on the first wash (in warm, not hot water). Someone needs to get to Munsingwear about their quality control!!"
5,Great as an undershirt,"I bought this to use as an undershirt. A previous reviewer noted that the V was low, and so I thought that it would be ideal. I was not disappointed - I wear this underneath my shirts, and the low V cut does not make it visible unlike other T-shirts that I have tried. I liked them so much I ordered 2 additional packs. If you're looking for something to wear on its own, you would be better served by looking elsewhere. The low V doesn't make it ideal for a standalone shirt."
4,Stanfields,"Munsingwear Comfort Pouch Brief 3-Pack - mw21-3For decades I have worn Munsingwear briefs and tee shirt. Until this purchase of twelve sets they were made in Canada (Quebec?). Every brief, every tee shirt were of equal quality. These which recently purchased were made in Asia. One never knows how each tee shirt will fit. While the ones that I purchased were XL one pack was barely that size and another pack was just like the kind that I used to get. Inconsistantly best describes the sizing both tee shirts and briefs. Another case of outsourcing with an eye for profit rather than quality of a product made in North America for which I would be willing to pay extra."
1,So disappointed!!!!!!!!!,"We have ordered these T-shirts for my husband three times and they are the only type that he likes but this time we are extremely disappointed. They are so much shorter and just don't fit right. They are also not near as soft as they usually are. WE would like to be able to return them but he likes everything washed before he wears it and I have already washed them. Anyway, we won't be ordering anymore. That is way too much money for the quality of the T-shirts!"
3,"Unusual ""V"" cut for a v-neck","The quality of the product is good, and I have no complaints about that. However, the cut on the v-neck was unlike any other v-neck t-shirt that I've ever bought. These shirts have a neck that is cut so low that when I put on a button down shirt with the top button or two open, you still can't see the undershirt. That's a good thing if you want to hide your undershirt, but it's not so good if you wear the undershirt without something over it. Without something over it, it just looks goofy - nothing like the picture. I have a broad chest and shoulders, but the cut on the neck comes all the way down to my sternum."
5,Brazil meets Blue Note,Although it's a very soulful album the mix of brazilian and jazzy modern grooves makes this album very usefull to overcome a rainy day!
2,Needs an editor.,"Normally I enjoy Kevin J. Anderson's works, but this is a difficult read. I hope the problem is Kindle edition only, but I'm constantly distracted by misspellings and typos that should have been caught before going to print. Mid story, there is an average of one error per page. The story, while interesting, drags at a snail's pace. The characters aren't particularly well developed or likeable. If I weren't so stubborn, I would have dropped this book within the first night's reading. Now I find myself plowing through a few chapters each night in the hopes that the finale will prove worthwhile."
4,Excellent Photographs,"I loved this book. I thought the photos were very beautiful and touching. However, it was Bulfinch Press who published it, not New York Graphic Society."
1,Misleading and inaccurate,"This book is just a bit of fluff to get some money out of the odd popularity of Pope John Paul II. I quickly found at least one very erroneous statement in it. The book states that Pope John Paul I was a centrist and ""was probably not going to be an innovator."" Anyone who knows ANYTHING about Pope John Paul I knows that this is a totally absurd (and unimaginable) assessment of the man. A poll in Italy showed that many millions of Italians believe he was killed by someone in the Vatican precisely because Pope John Paul I was so revolutionary in his ideas about birth control, poverty, and the church's irresponsible dehumanization of gay people. Pope John Paul I was set to be the greatest innovator in the history of the Catholic church. So this book lost all credibility with me upon reading such an apparently intentionally misleading statement."
4,box is wrong?,"The box says there are six doors, despite lots of trying we can only find five. The ""star"" you are supposed to look for is actually a bell. Hide the bell this year so you can look for it next year!"
2,Buggy as hell,"I have two SkyFi3 units and both of them are buggy as hell. Lots of lockups. Annoying issues with the pause/play buffer just erasing itself when you are in the middle of listening to something that you paused (long talk radio segments) Pressing skip forward and having the unit just replace the same commercial you are trying to skip, etc... I would suggest sticking with the SkyFi2, which was a rock solid radio."
4,quirky buy very nice for the current price,"It does lock up sometimes when going from car to house and vice versa. Pushing mode and volume a couple of times does the trick. Best feature is that I hooked it up to 4 AA rechargeable batteries and an extra power in plug, and with headphones and the antenna, I can bring it to the beach and have live xm for almost 4 hours! I paid less than $50 for everything, so I can live with the quirks. If you are like my wife and can't ever figure out which plug is which, buy a more simple unit, this one will be a frustration."
1,Dont Bother !!!!,Arrived new in the box. would not even power - up after charging it like the instructions said to do !!!Sent it back the next day.Buy a current model and save yourself the grief.....
2,OK if it worked longer that 8 hours,"I'm sure there are lemons out there with every product. Mine quit working after 8 hours in my car. Not 8 hours of use. I only used the item for about 45 minutes on my commute to work and 30 minutes for lunch. When it was time to go home from work it would not come back on. Returned the item on december 5th, and it has been stuck in Nashville since Dec 9. It is now Dec 28, still waiting for it to make it to lexington, KY. Some time after that I hope to get a refund."
2,Nice try...,"I had the SkyFi3 for 3 weeks. FM signal (even with attena connection) is week in urban areas. Audio out function failed. Being able to record content is great, but it is clumbsy to navigate and edit your recorded content. When you take it out of the package it feels light and ""toy like"" and it turns out - it is. I traded in for SkyFi2 - a much better model - though it does not have recording or mp3 functions - nonetheless it is a much better model. Delphi simply tried to do too much in this one. nice try, maybe next time."
4,Solid xm and mp3 player,"I was worried by some of the negative reviews of this receiver until I used it. Peoples biggest concern seems to be that the casing is platic instead of metal... sure it would feel nicer in your hand but is really not important. So far as lockups go, Im guessing that there was user error in the firmware update or the installation. I have 3 car kits, multiple MicroSD cards and have had NO issues. The ability to hear a song on the radio, record it, and merge it with your MP3s is effortless. It does everything its supposed to do very well and for a lot le$$ than any other player. The sure connect system works well but you still have to make sure the channel selected doesnt have anything being broadcast on it or you will hear static. My reasons for not giving it five stars: Monochrome screen, screen rotation does not allow you position the unit horizontally in either direction, plastic case. Its a great unit, and for less than $50 you cant go wrong."
3,Nifty!,"This product is really handy. It's a great satellite radio as well as MP3 player. I had to really read the directions, but you get used to it and it is easy once you know how to program, record and book mark. The screen has frozen a couple of times but other than that it has been a great investment. Plus the retailer sends you a form for a rebate that practically gives you the radio for free! ( I think this expires at the end of October)"
4,Excellent Product !!!,"I love Xm Radio portable radios. If you are the kind of person that really thinks in save money in tech products having at the same time something really good. This radio is for you.A little bigger but what else you can expect for the price unless that you prefer expend more for a similar radio. It works great, easy to install and the mini sdcard slot even better ( Now I can take my wife's favorite music without buying an additional mp3 player )"
3,I really want to like this unit,"Well, it is good to know that I am not the only one experiencing lockups. The radio works well, but I am most disappointed in the software package that they are using for the mp3 playback. I loaded up a 2 GB card all set to listen to my favorite stuff. The player first takes forever to read the card. This is where most of my lockups happen. I am trying again with much less music stored, and it takes far less time. My biggest gripe is why I can't just open the folder of music and play it. In order to play the musical Wicked, I have to create a playlist for it, because there is no way for it just to play in order the way it is in the folder. I hate having to make playlists and unless you want to listen to say, all of U2's music instead of individual albums, you will have to make a playlist for every album. What a pain!"
1,Sorry I bought this!,"I wanted to get this for a long time. The features make this unit very attactive for what I want. I really wanted to be able to record programs for later listening/download.This wasn't meant to be. In spite of some of the bad reviews, I crossed my fingers and ordered when I saw it on sale from J&R; Music World for only $29!I should have just thrown $29 out the window as I drove down the hiway. The unit locked up and became unusable after only two days of use. I only listend to the unit for 2 hours. It's dead and cannot be turned on at all. All this even after reading what others have done to remedy their problems, and a firmware update .Don't buy this.I will say that J&R; Music world has fantastic service."
1,Did not receive product,"Unfortunately, I didn't receive anything from the ""seller"". No item was ever delivered, no order confirmation, no tracking number, not even a thank you. I won't stop online shopping, but the idea of waiting on nothing is annoying. Good news is that Amazon makes it easy to get a full refund."
3,Radio Receiver,"The Delphi receiver works best when utilizing both the antenna and satellite receivers. On occasion, the satellite radio goes completely out and takes 12 hrs to recover after shutting the car engine off. It's also irritating when it takes a long time to do a media check (15+ minutes)."
4,"For what I paid,excellent receiver","for the money(40 bucks!) the delphi Skyfi3 lived up to my expectations.Yes the construction of this device seems a bit flimsy,but for the added bonus of a mp3 player 2gig sandisk card(3.00)and portable mp3 adapter you wont run out of music to listen to in in your car.you might want to update firmware first as i did and avoid any lock up issues others have had.also dont leave it out in the hot sun this causes the screen to darken up until it cools off"
3,"Cool product, has mind of its own","I would have given this five stars, because it looks really cool and works great in the car when it works, but sometimes it freezes, and other times it just doesn't work. Definitely long on features and looks, short on quality and reliability. Would I buy it again? Maybe. I would take a closer look at alternatives."
2,sounds is great - lockup is terrible,I used the Skyfi3 for about 2 weeks now. The sounds quality during music and the selection of XM channels is terrific. During speech you hear the compression artifacts but its not terrible. Since I upgraded the firmware to the newest version the unit constantly locks up. It's a terrible thing that makes me want to buy a different model. Do only upgrade the firmware if you have to...Don't fix what ain't broken.Add on: I do not believe in Werwolf's but I am telling you that the Skyfi3 seems more stable ( does not lock up ) when you have the background light on always. I had lock ups 3-4 times a day but for a few days its stable now - duh
4,As promised,"The Delphi SKYFi3 XM radio is an excellent product that gives me the versatility I want. The only problem I have found is the output on the fm modulator does not seem as strong, thus it gets over ran by the stations in the urban areas. The solution of running another wire to your car's antenna only adds to the frustration."
4,"When it works, its great","Overall, I love it. The ability to record XM material into mp3 format, is awesome. The mounting is very easy. I was able to mount it in my car without any permanency. You're able to just slip it onto the vent without blocking the vent, but I guess it depends on the vent you have.The only problem which I'm not sure if its a design flaw, or I just have a bad unit, is that it has a tendency to lock up. I find this happens if my car stalls and the power is interrupted to the car docking port. Fortunately, that can be remedied by a hard restart and everything is fine. I suspect it is a design flaw because I returned this to best buy and got a new unit and the new unit did the same thing."
2,lots of features,Well I got my Skyfi when my Pioneer xm receiver was stolen. I was completely happy with my experience from that receiver so I expected no problems. The Skyfi is packed with so many features that are awesome. However the one thing that I need for it to do well it really sucks at. That one thing is the ability to broadcast the signal to my car radio. I can not get it to to broadcast a strong signal on any channel. I am going to by another little Belkin transmitter just to plug in the earphone jack since my car radio does not have a tape deck or an auxillary jack. No channel picks up well. They all have static when trying to pick up the Skyfi signal.
3,Service,"The product was in excellent condition. The shipping was on time. The product however did not work to the specs. The company was very helpful in the return and refund policy. They were very professional on the phone, and their instructions were fantasic. This comapny is a 5 star company to deal with. The product was used so they had no control with the products performance."
1,I hate this thing,I despise this radio because it is unnecessarily complicated to use. I should have bought something that just receives XM radio channels and nothing else. Instead this radio has a bunch of modes I never use and they just get in the way. It doesn't know whether to be a radio or MP3 player or recorder or whatever else it does. When I'm driving I just want to hit one of the presets and have it tune to that station without a lot of programming steps or mode changes. I can't be taking my eyes off the road just to read the display to see why it didn't do what I expected it to do. I really don't need three different levels of favorite channels and I definitely don't want it to go off somewhere else when I hit a channel preset. Why can't it be more like a regular car radio when it comes to simplicity of use? Nuff said!
3,Cheapest portable XM radio available,"It's the cheapest portable XM radio out there, but there's a reason it's so cheap. I'd had mine for just over a year when it decided to go nuts, locking up and constantly having to reset the radio. Right now it's only good for listening to XM live and as an MP3 player, can't record any live XM or set any favorites. Other than the problems i'm having with my unit now before all the problems the unit had functioned perfectly. The interface is very user friendly and the sound quality is very good. It's a good deal for someone that just listens to it either in the house or in the car but not both. I think the constant powering on and off and switching power adapters was the cause of all my problems"
2,Not a good product,"I own the SkyFi, SkyFi2 and the SkyFi3... the first two where great, the SkyFI3 is an unreliable piece of junk.The features are great, such as the backlight auto turn off, the recording time, the ablilty to record songs for later.... BUT, since I have owned it (about 1 1/2 years), I have had it lock up countless times. Each time you have to reset it which will cause you to have to reconfigure it. What is worse is if you have any songs saved and you have to reset it, well, kiss those goodbye. They will show up still, but they won't play.In addition to the above, it will sometimes just erase all of your pre-sets. What is really bad, is when the pre-sets get erased, then the unit will not save new ones you try to set. You can reset the unit, and it will still do the same thing. What is really strange, is after a while, it will save the presets... but good luck guessing when that will happen.Do yourself a favor; avoid the SkyFi3, get the SkyFi2 or look for another receiver."
2,XM SkyFi,"It is great except it freezes up...literally, I cannot leave it in the car when it is cold out because it won't work the next morning. I have to unhook it every night and bring it in the house so that I can have music the next morning. Only down side to the thing. Finally had to replace because would not hold the memory and had to reset each time turned the thing on. Pain!!"
4,"nice unit , good features","I was initially baffled by signal strength-related issues until I researched that earlier generations of satellite radio modulators (including units I'd purchased in 2004) far exceeded FCC legal output power. The remedy was to remove my regular FM antenna and then this unit worked fine on the frequency I selected.The display area is nice and large, the buttons well-placed and the ability to access pre-set channels is convenient. I also like the capability to record songs and then play them back, using the unit as a portable mp3 player. The unit has good features for the price."
3,SkyFi 3,"I would like to rate this higher but the menu is not very user friendly. It doesn't respond to some of its own commands. For example you have to scroll through the channels and select each one you can't automatically switch to a channel. The XM Napster interface doesn't work worth beans. It is an execellent receiver and great for portability. I would rate it higher if the MP3 player part of it worked, but it is just too difficult to download music."
2,Buy something else,This is the second one of these units I have had. They both suffer from the same problem of locking up when they are booting thier firmware. There is no way to reset them other than to let the batterie die ~ 4 hours of uslessness. caveat emptor
3,okay,"This is a very goode little gadget. It's a great way to listen to radio...but it's commercial free. That's a good thing about this. But, it does freeze up at lease a couple times a week. It still plays the song while it's frozen but you can't use any of the functions at all. So, usually what I have to do is unplug it and plug it back in about 2 minutes later that way it can refresh itself. Other that that. I like it. You can also record songs off the radio so you can listen to them on the go if you don't have the antenna with it."
1,customer service is a joke,"Radio takes alot out of you when trying to deal with XM ""listener care""skyfi 3 has lots of bells and whistles but have fun trying to dial them in. thats why XM is dumping them for a low price, delphi made another bad product. Once XM gets your money and overcharges you for socalled 3 month prepay and 6.99 a month for additional radio lies, your on your own. the best way to deal with this radio is have it professionally installed with an FM direct module (i installed this myself) and play with it using the manual. the asian listener care personnel are zero help in any category. this is true for and part of XM. 800-XMRADIO gets you only to the phillipines and have fun trying to get thier broken english, frustration level......98 out of 1000"
1,"Unreliable, Don't Bother!",I have been through 2 Delphi XM recievers in three and a half years. They both broke after about a year and half. Go with Pioneer! They have a much more reliable product.
3,Strictly a Biography,It was a well done biography. The producers did their research and knew their subject. They obviously had an interest in their subject. Yet I was all about the teacher and nothing about the teachings. The main thing that sticks in my mind after watching it three times is numerous film clips of a crippled old man walking.
3,"Good, but could have had more math","This book does a good job of helping a person witheven minimal VisualBasic knowledge write what ends upbeing an powerful Sudoku generator and solver. I wasable to get through the example program and understandthe source code with a minimal amount of exposure toVB.On the downside, a lot of the source in the book seemsto be redundant. Some of the laterexamples--particularly the advanced parts of thesolver--seem as though they could have been bettermodularized, making the code-writing less timeconsuming. The math geek in me was also hoping for amore in depth analysis of the different solvingalgorithms and their various efficiencies.If you enjoy Sudoku and want to build your ownsolving/generation program, but really aren'tconcerned with an in depth analysis of algorithms,this is a good book."
5,The Spice Girls best ballad-type song so far!,"The Spice Girls Shine in this top notch single...Including three versions of Too Much, and Outer Space Girls (Excellent Dance Tune)...this is quite the song if you love the image of a High School gym dance..."
4,O.k. But the bonus song was really cool!,"Too much is an o.k. song, but the bonus song is awsome! It's called: Outer Space Girls. I think it was overall pretty good!"
5,I loved this single !!!!!!!,"I just bought this single, and I loved it !!! My favorite was (of course) Outer Space Girls. I would have bought it just for that song !!! The SoulShock and Karlin Remix was cool, too."
4,no medium,MY SON LIKED THIS ST. LOUIS FLEECE AND I WANTED TO GET HIM IT AS A GIFT.HE WEARS A MEDIUM BUT ALL YOU HAD WAS A LARGE SO I GOT IT FOR HIM ANYWAY.HE WAS SO HAPPY TO GET IT BUT IT IS TOO BIG FOR HIM TO WEAR.
5,Terrific!,"Girl, 15, Charming but Insane is an awesome spin on the overused idea of a young girl who is neither popular nor unpopular having a crush on the most popular guy at school. It had some very hilarious elements, such as fake breast implants, comparing boys to animals, and ""Poisonous Trash"". This is the sort of book you can read over and over and never get tired of."
3,A Story To Engage Teens,"This book describes how the main character,a fifteen-year-old girl deals with pressures that include jealousy, betrayal, and being embarrassed by family and friends. This is the first of a trilogy about life as a teenager. This book is good for younger teenagers to read. Many people go through the changes and heartbreaks experienced by the main character. It has many real life experiences within it and keeps you wanting to read more. Teenagers can relate to the story and the events that befall the protagonist. This is a story that teens will find engaging and humorous."
1,Did not receive what was advertised,The book was advertised as a hardcover which is why I purchased it. But I received a softcover version. I've henced notified the company and hopefully they have fixed their description of this product.
3,Ouch Ouch Ouch wait let me breath Okay go Ouch Ouch Ouch,I foolishly purchased this to take care of hair I would normally have waxed. It took about 40 minutes to completely clear the area and within 15 minutes I broke out in blisters that left marks that lasted for more than a month. I guess if you use it on your legs you will be okay. Anywhere else is truly uncomfortable.
2,Don't buy this thing!,"I have had it for about 2 years, and it is not worth what I paid for it. First, while using it on my arm, it grabbed the skin on my elbow and I had to remove the cover to free it. After that, I left the cover off while shaving. Now, it stopped working. When I examined it, I noticed that the ball bearing on the right side have mostly fallen out. When I take ball bearing out of the left side to insert them in the right side, they still fall out. I tried to contact the company about the problem over the internet, and for some reason I could not. You can save your money and buy something cheaper for the quality that you get with this hair remover."
5,This baby is great,"I have had my Emjoi for about 6 months now and I love it. I use it on my legs. Once you have used it a few times, it doesn't hurt much because there isn't as much hair. I do a quick once-over 3-4 times a week and it does the trick. I don't like it for underarms because it hurts too much so I went back to regular waxing there. It works fine in the bikini area but I was getting too many ingown hairs so I went back to wax strips in that area."
4,brought me out of the dark ages!,"I've been a faithful Epilady user for the past 15 years, but when I used this for the first time, I felt I was coming out of the dark ages. This works so well and causes no pain at all to a hard core user even with 2 months' growth!What I like best about this is the cordless capability. My corded devices became finicky over time (damaged cord, most likely), and I had to hold the cord a certain way to get them to work.I also really like being able to use this on the face (chin, upper lip). Epilady never worked there, and wax is such a mess.I feel mixed about the curved end. Yes, it helps get closer to the skin in some parts, but it also makes using it over knees and other areas next to impossible.Overall, I think this is a great product, and I am glad I purchased it."
2,Doesn't pull out entire follicle,"I used this product for several months, hoping that as time went on the hair on my legs would start growing back more slowly (as promised). Well, it didn't. I still have to epilate at least once a week, and I have to shave every couple of days to feel smooth. In addition, I have to rigorously exfoliate, or else I get major ingrown hairs. But it's still worth it, because it allows me to stretch to 3-4 days between shaving, whereas without the epilator, I felt as if I had to shave every day."
2,When men make things for women...,"The brochure of the Emjoi responds to the question, ""Why is the Emjoi curved"", with the answer, ""Because the female body has curves"".While it is delightful to note that the makers of this otherwise sturdy little machine have noticed this long-obscure fact about the female body, I do have to point out to them the following two startling observations:1. the female body also has parts that are flat, like thighs (maybe their models were barbies)2. the female body also has curves that are concave, not just convex, eg around the bikini line.Which means that a curved surface on the blades makes it almost impossible to reach hairs on those surfaces.I have ordered the Braun top of the line, which apparently has a a bikini-line special attachment. In any case, it appears that the blades are on a straight surface, plus it seems to be much higher seeling than the Emjoi. Will make a comparison once i get it, but if the above sounds relevant, bear it in mind."
1,The worst ingrown hair problem ever!!!,"The first use was fine - got all the hairs on my tummy and bikini area just great. I even expanded its use to my underarms. It was plenty painful under my arms but the results were worth it. Then all the problems started. When my hair started to come back in I used the Gently Gold again. I remember thinking how little it hurt. As near as I can tell it was snapping my thinner regrowing hairs off at skin level. Then the worst, I got raised, horrible, awful bumps along my bikini line and on my tummy! I had never had ingrown hairs. I discontinued use in the area. It's been months now and I am still dealing with unslightly ingrown hairs and the scars they leave behind when you finally liberate the hair. Back to shaving! I continued it's use on my underarms since the hair there was not as thin/frail as the hair elsewhere, then the durn thing burnt itself out after a total of 4 months use."
4,Good for the beginners,"I will not compare the epilator to wax or shaving, i'd better compare it to another epilator.The old one i had for 3 years is Braun - it's still in perfict condition, but i just wanted somethng new. Well, Emjoi AP-9GAR is really gental, less painfull than my Braun or Emjoi Optima, but it seems to be very slow and too gentle ( i don't need it). Especially, when you put it closer to the skin, it just slows down, almost stops, the hair removal may take for ever!A very nice thing is that it cordless - i love this feature.So, i would recommend Gently Soft for the first time users, but for advanced users i would recommend to try something else - faster and more agressive."
4,It works if you use it the right way!,"This product really works only if you use it the right way. Your hair needs to be prep first (read the instructions ladies) and if you do follow all of it, the results are much better. I tried using it quickly without prepping and my hair and all the negatives happened like hair not getting pulled out properly, only getting cut.It is so much cheaper to by this product than spend money regularly in a salon."
4,Six month review,"After using this epilator for 6 months I have mixed feelings about this method of hair removal. My hope in the beginning was to only have to ""shave"" every 4-6 weeks. Not the case! The hairs on your legs are constantly growing. Even though you have plucked the majority out at once, there will always be strays. I still have to remove hair several times a week. When the hairs grow back, they are lighter and thinner (good) but they tend to break off instead of pull out (bad). Even though I exfoliate my legs several times a week (which makes it very hard to keep a tan), ingrown hair can be a hassle as well. You have to carefully get the hair out with either sharp tweezers or a needle. In the end, even though your legs may LOOK hair free, they still do not feel as smooth to the touch as shaving. So, I still shave for special occasions. As for the pain factor, It did sting the first time, but I have actually started to quite like the feeling (weird huh?)."
2,OUCH!!!!,"Like I said, OUCH! I only wish it would make my legs a little more smooth and then I might not mind the intense pain so much. I have been getting waxed for years so I can handle pain pretty well but this is unbelievable, I actually have to take breaks to let the pain subside. I can eventually get my legs pretty smooth but not as smooth as shaving. The only thing that keeps me using it is that it is taking the hair out by the root so I know it won't come back anytime soon and it is cheaper than waxing in the long run!"
3,works ok,"This product does remove hair, and it does hurt. I would never dare to use it on my under arms or anywhere but my legs. It does leave hair soft, but still there. You will never be able to get the same silky soft legs that you can with a razor.I would recomend this if you have high pain tolerance and thick hair, but personaly for me I don't like it. (Although my friend uses it on her chin all the time and absolutly loves it)"
4,works great,Definitely not painless but this works great. It hurts pretty bad the first time but every time after that it's not bad at all and it keeps the hair away for a long time. Better than expensive waxing!
5,works well,"Let's just be clear,there is no joy about it. But it does work well. Once you get through the aweful first time it gets much easier because you can use it as you see hair."
2,Not a Great Choice for Coarse Hair,"After 2 years of using the Optima I decided to give this one a try, mainly because of the cordless option. I gave it a valiant effort, but it is just not powerful enough for me: it took twice the time of the Optima to get all the hair. It would likely be a worthwhile option for someone with fine or sparse hair."
1,Hair remover that hurts,"I was a frequent waxer, and thought wow look at this it will save me time and money compared with the ever costly salon visit (I'm including tipping and parking prices). I thought wrong, waxing I'll admit is extremely painful and can completely understand why someone could not go through with it. When I recieved this in the mail I was shocked to find not only did this not do such a great job of removing hair but hurt real bad horribly bad, so bad I really could'nt even use it. I'll stick to waxing from now on."
2,Won't charge anymore,"Works as listed, but doesn't keep the hair from coming back any better than shaving. Within a year, it will not charge, but can be used with the cord. Just didn't do what I expected it to do."
4,So far so good,"It is a little bit scary when you first time use it. I used it pluged in and only use it for underarm. It cannot pull out every hair you want to remove, and it needs experience to make it efficient, like the manual said, the skin should be taut when you work on that area. Overall, it is a ok product, better than shaving razor because it doesn't remove the surface hair, rather, it removes hair from the root. But, removing hair from the root might have a problem for ingrown hair. Regular skin massaging with a massaging glove or loofa, may help reduce the chance or occurrence of ingrown hairs.Be careful about the adapter, it is not ideal for travel because it doesn't have a worldwide voltage."
3,"Very good initially, but does not last","I purchased this product 2 years ago, after my braun epilator died after 5 years of constant use. Initially, I was awestruck. It was faster, it pulled very short hair out and was a bit less painfull. I also enjoyed being able to recharge it and take it along to trips with me. But after 1 1/2 years, it definetely started going downhill. It was not holding its charge very long and was not working as fast as before, even when it was plugged. It was taking longer each time to groom than ever. Finally today, it was making noises of a sick man and I decided it had to retire. So, I will go back to Braun again. I want my money to stretch for longer. Even though, initially it is very good, it is not a reliable product. I would not recommend it."
4,The Arabian Mistress,"I've read all of Lynne Graham's books and this one didn't disappoint me.As usual, there are other people involved in the split, but the story remains focused on Tarqi and Faye. In her usual style, Ms. Graham pens another story about a split caused by misundertandings and brings Faye and Tariq back together in a clash of passion.The back cover's blurb reads: ""Begging for Prince Tariq Shazad ibn Zachir's mercy was the last thing Faye wanted to do. She hadn't seen Tariq for a year...since their wedding. But Faye's brother was imprisoned in Tariq's homeland, and only Tariq could grant his freedom. Faye expected her meeting with the man she'd married to be tough, but Tariq's ultimatum took her breath away: become his mistress and her brother would be released!""S."
1,Yuck!,"I think the main character of the book, Faye, was suppose to be a Maria (as in the Sound of Music) type character. Unfortunately, instead of coming off as sheltered but determined she comes off as an idiot doormat. The whole hate to love relationship seemed forced and ridiculous. Last but not least, Faye would make a terrible wife for a ruler of a country."
4,Wonderful Arabian story,"I really enjoyed this story. Tariq is great and all the way through it, you could tell he really loved the heroine."
4,Authentic Tales,"Dorson's anthology consists of stories told by real storytellers from around the world. It's a great selection. Each tale can be enjoyed for its intrinsic qualities, and Dorson also provides interesting commentary on the texts and storytelling traditions. There's a fine variety of stories, and the texts are transcribed from actual storytelling performances rather than ""polished up"" as literary recreations. This sense of authenticity adds to the anthology's appeal, and Dorson includes background information on the tellers to provide readers with a better understanding of ways in which these stories are actually told within their communities. One concern, though, if you are planning to read these to children, be aware that some of the stories are a bit ""earthy"" -- or in Dorson's terms ""yeasty."" This authenticity is part of the anthology's signficance, and it shows that storytelling isn't just for children. But, some of the stories won't appeal to school librarians and cautious parents."
3,Troy-Bilt Super Bronco Tiller,"I am enjoying this tiller - I've just used it about 6 - 8 hours so far - I would say - The only complaint I would have - or suggestion to Troy-Bilt - is concerning the handles - As designed the handles and support bars are not substantial enough to manipulate the tiller without some bending/warping. I know this is a smaller piece of equipment than the ""horse"" and I am satisfied with the power and performance of the tiller - However it still needs to be manipulated in the garden, turned around to go from row to row. The handles are just TOO FLIMSY to accomplish this satisfactorily.T. Clopton"
4,Review by Anthesis,I found the tiller to be well designed and easy to use. The tiller came with a missing part for the wheels. The part was expeditiously replaced and I am content with the product. On a scale of 1-10 with ten being the best I would give this tiller an 8. The reason for this is that vibration in the handle caused by the motor operatioin was excessive. Anyone with a carpel-tunnel syndrom may experience a temporary aggravation of the condition due to having to forcefully grip the vibrating handle. I would also recommend instructions on pre-wetting the soil 24-48 hours before using the tiller for optimum performance.
1,Troy-Built POS!,"I bought this tiller about a year ago for a small garden and realized Troy-Built is manufacturing JUNK! If you want to break ground in 1 inch increments at a time, then this tiller is just for you! If you want to vibrate your hand to death while tilling, then this tiller is just for you. If you want a tiller that is hard to control by tilling in a straight line, then this tiller is just for you. If you want to tear out the guts for hours to replace a belt with no instruction what so ever on how to do this, then this tiller is just for you. I guess this is a company now operated by a CEO interested in profits only and willing to compromise quality and consumer satisfaction for self gain. It's sad to see a good company going down the drain. I will never purchase a Troy-Built product again."
1,Bent mine within a month,"I like the looks of this tool. It's comfortable, and the handle lets you get a lot of leverage. It's nice in loose garden soil, but it's not sturdy enough for compacted soil. I bent mine soon after I started using it on the dandelions in my lawn.UPDATE: I made use of the warranty and got a new one. I've been more careful with it and it's performing well. I'd give it a couple more stars now, but I can't seem to change that part of my review."
2,Great Until it Snapped,"This tool was very useful and had great ergonomics. Unfortunatley, the light weight came at a great cost -- it broke within the first few weeks of ownership. It helped me weed out about 100 dandelions before it snapped violently in slightly stiff soil."
5,Radius Garden Tool - excellent grip,The curved ergonomic grip allows excellent leverage when digging. I could apply much stronger force without stressing out my wrists and forearm as in traditional straight grips.
2,"Great idea, but poor quality.","The tip broke the very first time I used it. About 1 1/2 inches broke off the end of the tool in the dirt. Tool still works, but the lightweight metal is too lightweight for any serious weeding. Very disappointed!"
3,oops it broke,"I liked the long design of the weeder specifically for dandelions and their deep roots. After a few hours of using the tool and liking the effectiveness of the weeder, I attempted to remove a dandelion from a location along a concrete curb. I sunk the blade in the soil and use the concrete as a leverage point. The metal blade snapped and broke off in the ground. Darn! Well it was great for a few hours."
5,best garden tool ever,"This purchase was for a gardening friend's Christmas gift from me. I purchased one for myself earlier this year and use it regularly when weeding or sometimes planting. It is the BEST tool, and much easier to use than a small trowel. I like that I can dig the entire root out easily. Much less stress on my wrist and hand using this great invention. I love it so much that I wanted my friend to have one too."
5,Great garden tool,The radius grip weeder is now my favorite garden tool. It's a lot easier on the hand with the ergonomic padded grip and does a great job. Start out easy when you first start to use it and be careful if the ground is extremely hard. It's a great time saver when you learn to use it properly.
4,Important contribution,"Chomsky and I disagree on a lot, but he offers some compelling insight into the organizations that usurp modern democracy. Organizations such as the CIA and the media, for example. He also has thoughts about gun control, fundamentalism, and even sports.I'd reccommend it for anyone interested in wanting to know more about the world around them, or about Chomsky's views."
1,Typical Chomsky.,"Typical Chomsky; too general and vague to be thought provoking. His usual template, elite vs. populace, is applied to everything. There is no frame of reference nor explaining the dynamics of the situation. His references are nill. If people want to educate themselves on a particular topic, read material that is complete and indepth."
4,Know What You Are Getting,"I ordered the 2007 version. After a long wait I received the 2006 version. As advertised, this is an audio CD. No scenes whatsoever. It is a recording of a rehearsal. Music is fine but, towards the end, has slight background noise that sounds like rain."
4,nice boots,"I bought this at [...].com and for the price I paid [...]it's a good buy. It runs a little smaller than expected. Good thing I ordered 1 size bigger -- I usually wear a 7.5/8 and I bought a 9. I wore this with 2 layers of socks, and I was fine. Warm enough for me. The only reason it's 1 star less is that I can feel an uneven patch/piece of sole. If you look at the picture of the boots from the bottom, there's a small trapezoidal protrusion below the brand and this is what I could feel. But my feet got used to it after a couple of hours, so no problem here (maybe it just needs to be broken in)."
3,Cute boots.,"Good boots for the value, under $25.00, but only if you want to wear them occassionaly. Otherwise, they aren't of the durable quality of UGGS. I would NOT pay full price for these."
1,Don't waist your money - Go to the Library,"There is nothing special about this book that makes it worth so much more than other similar books that cost a lot less. Most of it is dumb common sense and is freely available online from the IRS website. Your first money saving tip, find another book. It really is a rip off for what you get. This book is very shallow and very vague. Where's the beef? The quality is not much better than a glued magazine. Go to the library."
1,Buy another book!,"This book was ok, however, I was hoping more detail and less basic information. It provides good info for a new real estate player, but seasoned players who want more information on what and how can do better by contacting their CPA. I was hoping to get more and in the end I found -0- ideas that I was not aware off. Rename the book-real estate tax relief for newbies! Seasoned players do not BUY!"
2,SEMPER FI: VIETNAM,"Semper Fi: Vietnam is strictly a history book written by a general for generals. It's devoid of any personal feelings and observation by the troops. It's as sanitized as a war can get. In typical fashion, for a general, he was enamored by the body count as it was the measure of success or failure for staff officers. Of course we all know about how you count bodies in Vietnam where 1 possible VC KIA at the squad level became 60 KIA when it got up to the division level."
1,NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT,"I have been using norelco cool skin 7735x blades for about 10 years - they advertise and show you a picture that they are the same blades, but they send you the 8000 series which is much different and leaves burn red marks on your skin. I ask why would you advertise and show the pic of the product and send something different? This has happened to me sereval times with different vendors....just looking to get the 7735x cool skin blades....someone help!!!!"
1,I was sorry,"I ordered a replacement set of shaver heads ""Norelco HQ177,"" advertised available at $28.99, from Goodman's. Days later I received Norelco HQ8, advertised at 24.99, with an invoice stating that ""HQ177 no longer available, Upgrade to HQ8."" The HQ8 will fit the Series 77 shaver, but it is not a recommended replacement by Norelco. I tried the HQ8 head. Each cutting guard has reduced openings of about 40%. It is impossible to get a close shave with this head. My three year old heads are better. Note: There was no adjustment for the difference in advertised price of $4.00, by Goodman's."
4,solid set of obscure soul songs,"I love various artist soul collections from the 60s and 70s --- the more obscure the better --- and was very happy with this purchase. This is a solid collection of fairly obscure Northern Soul songs, some of which stick in your brain for days at a time. Almost all the tunes on here were recorded between 1966 and 1969, one track from 1973 being the odd one out. Like all of the uniformly excellent soul compilations put out by the Kent and Ace Records team, this one includes a booklet that is packed with details on each track and artist, plus some vintage photos. A definite keeper."
5,MARVELOUS!!,"I have Julia Cameron's books on ""The Artist Way"" and knew her to be both inspiring and very practical. Since I follow the guidance of my heart, when I saw her little book, ""Heart Steps"", I knew I wanted it. Because of its nice, little gems of wisdom, it felt right to include reading it as a regular part of my morning meditation and prayers. I took her advice and started reading only one passage per day. I read the passage out loud, three times. I find I open up to more wisdom and inspiration with each repetition. I'm also experiencing a wonderful synchronicity with the morning's passage and what's going on in my life. I love this litte book and highly recommend it to anyone who's inner spirit guides them to it."
3,Not for me,"A bit too heavy on the ""God"" reference for me - I find my spirituality in nature and our mother earth. The passages are not poetic at all - they're declarations like the subtitle states - e.g. I will do X, I will do Y. The short quotes and titles to the passages are more inspiring & thought provoking than the passages themselves."
4,A fascinating perspective!,I think this is a must read. It is an interesting view of the Latin American reality which includes a bit of humor along the way. It is a book everyone interested in Latin America should read because it is enlightening and shows another side of the Latin American reality whereby the United States is not culpable for all of Latin America's shortcomings.
1,Poor reprint quality ruins a great series,Make a plate-by-plate comparison of the new Waterfowl or Shorebirds guides with the original hardcover editions and you'll see that the sofcover illustrations look like cheap color photocopies. All of the subtlety and detail that made the originals the best field guides of their kind has been lost. Save your money for the used bookstores.
5,Very Pleased,I was told this book was out of print and would cost about $200 dollars when the next printing was done. The fact that I could find one now and at a fraction of the cost makes me a happy birder.
1,"This poster is NOT 24"" x 36"".","I just wrote a letter to the company because this poster measures 22"" x 34"", so it requires a matte if you want to put it in a frame. There is no frame that measures 22"" x 34"". I'm disappointed b/c I don't think that it looks nice with the cheap-o paper ""matte"" that came with the poster frame. I was expecting it to fill the whole frame, not have an extra inch around the outside.The poster itself is beautiful, I'm just mad that it doesn't fill the frame."
2,Boring,"I just couldn't get into this book. It was slow and uninteresting, and I had the real killer figured out in the first chapter. I find Ms. Kane's books hit or miss for me; some I've enjoyed, some not. Decent plot that should have been much more interesting, but it just wasn't for me. Read the first quarter and skipped to the end. Glad others found it enjoyable tho."
3,Worth a read,"Interesting characters back up a pretty decent plot. Some of the situations and characters are a stretch, but this book still delivers an entertaining and suspenseful story. The culprit is fairly obvious, still Ms. Kane is a talented storyteller.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
4,Great read,Really enjoyed this book because it moved along and had a twist in the end. The main characters we believable and likeable. Really liked 'Monty' and his son.
1,waste of money,"I took these pills 4 times and they did NOTHING. They don't deserve a single star. Don't waste your money on them, like I did."
1,waste of money,"I took these pills 4 times and they did absolutely nothing.They don't merit even a single star. Don't waste your money on them, like I did."
2,Yard Mouse,"Our Yard Man lasted less than a full season. It cut grass fine, and I never had a problem getting it started etc. However, it lacked durability. Almost immediately, the plastic housing which covers the engine began to crack, and eventually broke in several places. Early this season, the Yard Man began to spit out the spark plug every once in a while. The part of the engine housing the block was worn / stripped and I had never put a wrench on it at all. Another reviewer mentioned an engine block problem. I think the Yard Man's engine blocks are too weak."
1,Cheaply made!,"I bough this Yard Man Mower in 2001 and it is falling apart. It has too light of metal gage for a housing, the handle broke, a metal bracket broke off under the house and was destroyed. The only thing I can say good about it is that the motor starts on the first try and that's about it. I would not recommend this brand to anyone."
1,Yard Man 21-Inch 6.75 HP Gas-Powered Self-Propelled Mower #449C,This product needs more explanation about warranties because every part is cover by different manufacture and they does not want to cover that warranty because we bought that product via internet.Take care with that product.
2,Yardman Tec engine not so reliable,"After three years of satisfactory use the engine (always checked and changed the oil, cleaned filter, etc.) finally ejected the muffler and there was no way to fix the block. The plastic (!!!) shroud melted by the first season but that we expected."
2,"I have one like this, havent even used it 2","after not even two years the whole deck rusted trough... also the bracket that holds the carburator in place broke off...guess it could just be mine, but i'm sure pissed.... and I bet I can't find the reciept anymore...."
3,Weaves a difficult thread,"This is the first Anita Brookner book I have read, and even though I was entranced by the story line, I found the sentence structure long and rambling. Ms. Brookner weaves her thoughts with a difficult warp. Her repetitive return to previously covered subjects left me often wondering if something had changed...didn't I read about this before. Sometimes I felt it was too rambling and ended up skipping whole paragraphs just to avoid the trackless thoughts. Even though she has won prior awards, Ms. Brookner might want to think about getting a new editor."
3,updated tea shop info,"The book was wonderfully written and makes you want to try each of the shops described. However, of the shops I wanted to visit, only one seems to still exist.Lisa's Tea Treasures: phone number no longer in service and website removedTea & Company (now Mighty Tea Leaf) closed down their storefront 15 months ago and only does business over the phone and catelogA'Cuppa Tea moved from the Crocker Galleria in SF to Berkeley (510 420-0196)English Rose - no one answered the phoneI wonder if the author will publish an updated version of the book."
5,One of her best singles,"First off: this is one of the best singles by any artist, and even Bjork. Usually singles should only be bought by die-hard fans who need to have the B-sides, but this is a must buy for even the casual Bjork listener. The first song, the radio edit of 'Bachelorette', is absolutely stunning. It stands out among the rest of the 'Homogenic' singles because it's so uplifting, whereas the album as a whole is pretty dark. 'My Snare' has a great beat, and 'Scary' is like something out of a musical. Both great songs. The final song, a different version of 'Bachelorette' really brings out the power of the strings because it doesn't feature the piano part. Overall, this is a MUST have."
1,couldn't use,I couldn't use. I have a 64 bit system and this must be for a 32 bit system. I gave it to my son.
5,"Really, - Challenging Geometry","This books presents a lot of problems to solve. One challenge after another, you can find several problems and better still if you get stuck, you have hints that really help in solving the problems, and one, sometime two or even three different ways of solving it.As written at Plato's academy, for geometers only, you have to be willing to spend sometime doing geometry."
5,Intuitive Guide,"This book is suitable for anyone who want to learn advanced high school geometry or want to participate in any mathematical contest and have to learn much though not really new on it. The problems are set from the quite easy to advanced, with many of them are quite simple so you don't get frustrated because you can't do any of the problems. It covers the basic and common problems in math contest.Unfortunately, it don't have good set of theorems. Sure, it's written on the back but they're not easy to navigate. Also, many of them are not really basic even for contest geometry. Like its title, 'Challenging' is sure quite challenging, since many of the problems, though not really hard, need deeper thinking and you need to draw the 'help line' to solve the problem. The hints written on the back is not really helpful.Overall, for those who want to improve skills, participate in contest, or teacher who wants to make a surprise test, this book is a really good source of information."
3,A missing song,"These are my two favorite Barry Goldberg albums - however, the last song on ""Reunion,"" titled The Answer's in Your Head, was left off. You should get the two albums seperately so you have the complete song list from the albums. That is the only reason I did not give this CD 5 stars."
4,The :) Review,"I first have to admit the main reason I chose to read this book was because it appeared to be a fast and easy read. To my surprise it turned out to be a very good book. Although the book didnt always keep my interest at a high point, I didn't really want to put it down. The main character, Alice, an artificial inteligence researcher who creates a program named Edgar who ends up developing self-awareness. As they communicate through their only means of interaction, e-mail, Edgar begins developing, and starts to learn the differences between right and wrong.Alice wants complete control of Edgar so no one else gains credit for his creation. But Edgar on the other hand has such a passion for his independance that he can't bare to be controlled. I didn't like the ending, because it left me guessing what happened to Alice. All in all it was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about artificial intelligence or anyone who just likes an easy read."
2,Didn't care for this book.,"I found this book very dull... If you are a huge fan of AI, it might be of some interest but the story line from this book reminded me of a cheap B-flick that plays after midnight on the USA channel. It was choppy in places and really was rather shallow."
4,"The nature of life, the tragedies of love.","I read this book right after reading Cold Mountain and seeing Titanic, and interestingly enough, Exegesis has much in common with the other two tales. In some way, all three are narratives about what it means to be human, what it means to love, and what it means to live and die. Exegesis is a quick read, but well worth some introspection, and not only about the possibilities of artificial intelligence."
4,< E X E G E S I S > _A s t r o T e l l e r_,This book was very unique. It had a good plot and kept me interested. He did something different than other people. He told a story about a human having relations with artificial intelligence. This book was very intersesting to read. Plus it was quick and easy to read.
1,Beware,"Pendant did look nice and as the other reviewer said, clasp has a lot to be desired.. Four months later a stone fell out and was lost. Oh well best to deal with people who stand behind what the sell. I was offered a five dollar credit by Amazon to get it replaced at a local jeweler."
5,14k Yellow Gold Journey Diamond Horseshoe Pendant,Wonderful gift/item to Honor the horse you Love or just your Love of the horse!
5,Spaced-out Psychedelic Masterpiece,"Et Voilá...! Here you have the beginning of Gong's astonishing 'saga', a strikingly creative masterpiece of spaced-out psychedelia. Daevid Allen's dreamingly blistering glissando guitars, Gilli Smyth's heavenly psychic space whispering, Pip Pyle's fantastic, raw-edged drumming and Didier Malherbe's wailing saxophones are a lysergic joy to listen, a free-wheeling psychedelic musical dream. This is an outstanding masterwork, a must for all fans of space rock madness!"
4,Traditional Family Book,This is an excellent book that explains a traditional family tree. It is written in first person and the writer is a girl. She has a mom and a dad and a brother. There is a page at the end for the reader to write in the members of his or her own family tree.
5,"i LOVED this book when i was little, now looking for one for my daughter!!","i read this book back in the 70's, when i was in grammer school. when i was in my 20's, i borrowed it from the montclair, nj library to re-read!! (no kidding!!)now, i have a 9 month old daughter, and even though she obviously doesn't do much more than chew on the books right now, i want her to have this book for when she is older.so i am here trying to get a copy of this book.i am so sorry to hear of the author's passing (your grandmother, if you read this), but what better way to live on than through the children who have read, and obviously SO enjoyed, this book.i love her for the joy that she has given me, and i hope to pass that on to my daughter.thank you, patricia, i love you for writing this book."
4,A book I read and reread countless times as a young girl.,"I had forgotten about this book until I couldn't sleep the other night. Then it took me a half hour to come up with the title. I remember reading it over and over, always being a little bit scared, but having to finish it anyway. I wish I could find my old paperback edition, though I may have worn it out. I hope I can find a copy for my kids to read."
5,Jane-Emily by Patricia Clapp,"I read this book in gradeschool--it was wonderful! When I began reading Gothic romances in high school, I ran across it again...In a garage sale I got my own copy, only to have someone ""borrow"" it permanently...this is one of the best 'young adult' books I have ever read (and I read the way some people do drugs!)"
5,Very memorable and deeply magical,I too read this book in elementary school and it has haunted me ever since. It really tapped into something for my pre-adolescent self. It's a shame it isn't in print because it is a classic.
5,Amazing - Then and Now,"I absolutely loved this book as a child (11-12) - I read it over and over and it scared me to death every time. As an adult, I just found it in the basement and decided to read it again - and again, I could not put it down. It's well-written, suspenseful - and yes, still scary! What a fantastic read! (Amazed it was never made into a movie?!) However, I would say that it's for the 10 and up crowd...I am putting it aside for my own eight-year-old and going to wait a couple years before I give it to her."
1,NOT about selling letterhead!,"This CD has absolutely NOTHING to do with selling letterhead. It's a trick. It is really about selling ""information"" over the internet. If you are interested in that, then buy it. But know that you are first being tricked by the title, so I don't know if I would trust the product. I bought the EXACT SAME cd, only the title was about selling ""cranberry juice"" instead of ""letterhead"". I threw it away."
2,you get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for.The winding mechanism is like having a paper weight attached to the middle of a cable. However, a paper weight would probably be sturdier than how this thing feels.The sound quality is just disturbing. Even once you adjust your treble (if you can) it still sounds like you're listening to a phonograph in the middle of a narrow concrete tunnel. On mute I somehow manage to hear an air noise which reminds me of sitting in an airplane waiting for take off with an air jet blowing on me from above. Apparently the word to describe the sound quality is 'claustrophobia'.Just about the only thing these earbuds have right is comfort. I could wear these things for hours and forget about them being in my ears."
2,Great but break FAST,These were a life saver at first. I loved not having to deal with all of the excess cord involved with non-retractable ear buds. I have no idea why there are not more retractable models to choose from on the market.The problem with these was that they broke in less than three months. The right ear bud completely fell apart and I was unable to piece it back together. If you don't mind buying a new set of headphones every two or three months then these could be good for you.
4,retractable earbuds,I've used many different retractable earbuds and so far these are the better sound and have a longer cord. I've not had them long enough to know how long they will last but they seem to be of better construction compared to the others. They give you extra ear cushions and the sound quality is noticeable better. The cord length is appreciated. These retractable earbuds by nature are vulnerable to breaking easily but for me they are worth it. I love the retractable capability.
3,Okay for the $$,Bought these earbuds because I was tired of always having to untangle the ones I had. These aren't the best at retracting but they're okay for the money. If you're careful and slow they'll retract alright but if you pull them quickly they'll get tangled.
1,Didn't work from the start,"The very first time I used these earbuds, there was a short in the wire. So I returned them. Also, if your iPod is in your pocket, the spool ends up at the middle of your torso with no place to clip it, and it will pull the earbuds out of your ears if you let it hang freely. Poor quality overall."
2,They would have been perfect,The sound quality would be excellent if I can get the left ear bud to work properly. It doesn't work well and I haven't had it for 3 months yet. It seem like not too long after use it started going out. I have to constantly twist it to try and make it work of which it will if I stay still but if I am exercising I can't exactly do that. I am looking for another pair.
4,Great product; great price,"I'm very happy with my purchase. The length is longer than previously purchased retractable buds. My only complaint is that I wish the location of the storage holder was in a better place. It's not high enough to clip onto your shirt collar and it's not low enough to clip onto the bottom of your shirt. It has to be clipped in the middle of your shirt, which can be awkward."
2,Retractable????,"Sound quality is okay, the earbuds are comfortable. The retraction worked for about 1 month and now only can be full length or totally shortened...."
2,"Comfortable, good retraction, poor quality","Same gripe as @Cajn Thunder: the left earbud went bad (intermittent sound if you jiggle the connection) after about 6 months. Otherwise, I rather liked these earbuds.Compared to other headphones, these ones produced quite a loud signal. Sometimes that's good, but it was painful when I would switch my iPod between my car and my headphones and get blasted in the ears."
2,gift for daughter,"She says that the tips for the buds arent that good, and the weight of the middle piece pull the buds out of her ears."
4,Good for its price,It worked for quite a long time for me. Can't expect more considering the cheap price. The design can be better though.
2,Great idea but needs work,"I bought these as a gift for my husband's Christmas stocking. Here we are 5 months later and I just learned these didn't last three months. He is not abusive with his ""toys"" but after a few months of using these they have shorted out. Great idea but the follow through needs work. Three months to me is not long enough to have them already for the trash. Very disappointed."
1,Broken twice,"I purchased these earphones to use while at my desk and while running. The first pair I bought broke after about a month, I think the wiring was severed from the retractable action, and both ear buds quit playing. I tried to salvage my investment by holding the cord in just the right position to have them work, but even this was ineffective after a while. I emailed the company and got a replacement pair with no problem. However, after 4 months these did the exact same thing. The company is responsive to complaints, and the sound quality is good, but the workmanship is shoddy and the equipment breaks down. I've given up on them."
1,earbuds,didn't work correctly. had to mess with the cord at the connector to hear sound out of both buds. Sometimes it worked fine and others had to mess with it.
1,Jack end was not as shown in the picture,This was not sent as pictured. I do not like the straight ended jack because it shorts out quickly. The 'L' shaped one does not break. VERY disappointed that what was send was not as pictured.
5,Great teaching tool!,We use these for both training our staff and we use these for any moms who are also interested in learning more detail
4,order review,I like the product because it is very informative. I don't have another product to compare with. I am going to us it in my childbirth classes
3,Odd flavor,"I've eaten plenty of gumbo over the years (my family is Cajun and comes from Louisiana), so unlike other reviewers here I have something to compare this to. Gumbo file should have a mild, sweet flavor. This gumbo file tastes strong and very much like oregano - nothing I've experienced before. It wasn't bad, but I really didn't like it and I wouldn't recommend it."
4,PALM BEACH,"To almost anyone, Tiffany and Co. and Palm Beach would go hand and hand, analagous like Lalique and Monte Carlo. The concept for this book is very interesting and the author fully realizes how to exploit the two to their most advantagious. The text is highly informative and the images are crisp and beautifully presented. I agree with one of the reviews that this is an expensive coffee table book, but frankly im sure those interested in this sort of thing, will not think twice about the price of admission. Really a wonderful book on a very interesting subject, well done indeed."
2,Kinda reaches a bit for proof,"The book, as much as I would like to say otherwise, does reach conclusions that are not supported well by pertinent facts. For example, the claim the govt knew about Sept 11th before it happened. Why? Because for years people said ""something was going to happen somewhere"". Hence the gov't knew on Sept 11th there would be planes crashign into building. But by using 10 year old speeches to prove the gov't knew something was going to happen is a stretch.Similar conclusions in the book exist, and it detracts from the possible truth that is in the chapters."
1,Offensive,"This book was disgusting and offensive. It was explosive for the sake of being explosive. I am not conservative or right wing. This book is against pretty much everything and does not offer any ideas as to how to change the problems of the mainstream. It seems that it was written just to make money for a corporation, the corporation that published it. Yes, thats right, it isn't some underground independant book, big shocker. It was VERY offensive to women. It also denied mental illness. I would DEFINETLY not recommend this book."
1,Everything you read in this book is wrong,This book glorifies colonialism.This book says China now has the capacity to completely destroy the U.S. navy...Hello!? !!!A collection of lies. Don't waste your money on this trashy book. It would be an insult to your bookshelf.
1,Another flop - sorry I purchased it,"Along with their other book, I was disappointed. Actually, that is a huge understatement. My library is filled with books that actually debunk lies we have been told, exposés that can be followed and proven. This one, was loaded with disinformation and other info that was totally out-of-place and made for some dry reading.Despite the enticing title and blurb on this book, it was a major let-down, and found its way to the trash rapidly."
2,Not nearly as controversial as it thinks it is,"What you really want to read is ""Travels with Dr. Death"" by Ron Rosenbaum, which is a far more interesting, less pretentious exposition of the conspiracy theory pulp.This book is a just ...like pseudo-intellectual pap. Most well-read people can poke holes in the oh-so-insightful arguments and rants without breaking a sweat.This book does not uncover anything you haven't seen exposed on 60 Minutes or any dozen web sites already. Fun to flip through but I would be ashamed to put it on my bookshelf for fear that a legitimate intellectual might see it and snicker."
2,Russ Kick has but one view...so who is lying?,"This book was in a condo we rented and I read it. It is like so many of our colleges, all the 'experts'and the author are anti-war activists or anti-American and there is little or no other side/view.I see where the next group of experts for Kick's new book, ""You are Still Being Lied To...."" are of the same ilk.This book will appeal to those who see only one side, anyone who wants a clear picture will have to research it for themselves or find a more balanced author...you won't find it here."
2,Along with this title.,"Should be 'everything you thought you knew is wrong', but nit-picking aside this reads like it was assembled and edited by six year olds. Believe me, there's nothing here you shouldn't already know unless you're a total drone. Boring, limited, pseudo-conspiracy schlock."
1,another cash grab,This book is another glittering example of bad academics mixed with media hype and the quick- lets - grab - some- hot- topics syndrome. The writers are just out to ride the conspiracy wave. Keep your money...
3,Ok product,"It didn't come with any recommended amounts to use to sweeten any foods. I had to look it up online. I thought it tasted ok, but my husband and brother thought it left a very bitter aftertaste. I didn't notice the taste and neither did my sister n law."
4,Recovered Memory,"I was a serviceman stationed near Brindisi, Italy in the late 60's. One of the songs I recall that I first heard at a friend's wedding to an Italian Girl was L'arca di Noe. The song was stuck in my psyche for decades. I finally was able, with the advent of the internet and Amazon's music lists, to find a way to get the song L'arca di Noe. Thanks Amazon. Readers: get this album and listen to the song; you will understand my sentiment."
5,Great,"This was purchased as a gift and the recipient is incredibly pleased - looks exactly as described, very durable. Thank you!"
1,Doesn't work with iPhone 4 or iPod Classic 7th Generation,"I bought this item to use with my iPod Classic 160 GB. It transmitted the audio signal to the TV, but the video didn't show up. I also tried it on my iPhone 4, but the result was the same; no video signal. I went into each devices' settings to try to get the video signal through but no success. I suspect that that neither Apple device has a video out connection in the earphone jack, which is what this cable utilIzes. I plan on returning this product and buying the Apple HDMI cable instead."
3,Ghost Train DVD,Ghost Train is a Japanese movie dubbed in english. The movie had a good story line with a supprise ending. I gave it a 3 rating mainly because of the quality of the film. I think most cult horror film buffs will enjoy this one.
2,Seen it before.,This is a rather tame Japanese horror flick. That shows us nothing we haven't already seen from other Japanese horror movies like the Ring and Grudge.
3,wish the light was brighter,This light works and the motion sensor is great but it's not that bright. I want it for the front door area and it's barely bright enough to see my key.
3,Good as long as you don't really need the sensor,"I bought three of these to put some light in the closets in my apartment and they do that job just fine. The light isn't super bright but you can easily see by it. The problem I had was that the sensors only worked for about a week on all three of them. Now the only way to make them work is to actually turn them off and on manually. It's not a big enough problem to return them as I don't really need the sensor, but it's still annoying. If you don't need the sensor feature, then these lights are a good buy for the price. They're a good size and are easy to mount on a wall. Perfectly functional but not great."
5,Love this little light!,"I love this little light! It's being used to light the 'water closet' in our master bath, and is perfect. It comes on when you enter the room, and gives plenty of light so that you can see what you're doing during the night when you need to 'go'. The 30 second timer is a little short, but moving your leg a little triggers the light to come on again. Perfect!"
4,if you need something without plugging in or run wiring this is ok,my log cabin makes it difficult to have outlets just anywhere or running wire just anywhere. it gives off a good bit of light in a dark room. in my case this will serve itself most in a power outage when coming down the stairs or using the bathroom where i have them placed. not quite 5 stars because the daylight sensor is not the greatest as it trips on during the day sometimes.
3,"Good light, but faulty switch","I like that this light fixture is adequate as a night light- area light. So, for me, it serves the purpose. Unfortunately, it is battery operated and the battery terminals in the first two I bought were faulty. I had to jury rig a tin foil connector to make them work. That accomplished, they work great, but I hope I am not draining the batteries. The instructions were no help. So, if you are a bit handy, you may be able to make these work. I do like them; for the price, maybe a deal. I'll wait and see."
5,Motion-Sensing LED Light,"The light responds with adequate illumination, as it should, to movement in a darkened room, yet it does not operate unnecessarily when there is already sufficient light."
4,good for indoor use,"Count me among the rest of the reviewers who think this is indeed a pretty good, inexpensive motion-activated light. I've got one mounted in the upstairs hallway where I live, and it works; when something moves, the light turns on, stays on for a few minutes, and turns off. By no means does it fill the area with bright light. It's more like an LED keychain light, if that, but it suffices for safety lighting.No word on battery life. Another reviewer says they last 1-2 years before needing replacement. I will be ordering more of these, as they're good enough for my requirements.*EDIT* The first set of batteries lasted about ten months before they were totally depleted. Fortunately, I swapped out the cheap, leaking alkalines before they damaged the light, replacing them with some Sanyo Eneloops which hopefully will not leak."
1,Piece of Crap DOA,"I started off by buying one of these. When I put the batteries in and turned it to the ON position, the bulb flashed once and never worked again. I figured it was a fluke that it didn't work, so I returned it and bought two more. One for the garage and one for the dining room, surely these will work. NOPE, when the other two showed up, I put brand new batteries in them and nothing happened, not even a flash like the first one. They didn't work in the ON position or the Sensor position.I bought these because of the high rating others have given them. Is there a severe quality control issue going on here with Maxxima?? What kind of crap are they trying to sell us. DO NOT BUY."
5,Let Me Illuminate You Regarding This Product...,"I ordered this as a night light for my visually impaired Mother. It has a dusk to dawn sensor along with a motion detector. I works perfectly for her and I may get one for my den. When I ordered is somehow missed that it was battery operated but, upon reflection, it really doesn't matter because of the LED it has very low battery consumption. I recommend this item."
2,"good shipping, shotty product","While the item was well packaged and arrived on time; it does not function completely. The light isn't very bright but is enough for a small stairwell or to light the landing of a basement stairway, but the motion sensor does not trigger the light. After trying multiple trials in varied degrees of light, providing motion at different distances and heights... nada. This light ends up being an expensive, bulky, tap light.Maxxima MLS-01 Occupancy Sensor LED Light"
5,Works great! Actually too bright!,"I am currently serving in Afghanistan and bought three of these to provide light at the entrances and in the hallway of our living quarters. They work great! In fact, they are so bright that I had to put tape over the top half of the lens to dim the light down. I only wish they had a hood to direct the light down to the floor. The motion sensor works great and the dawn/dusk sensor keeps the light off if there is a light on in the room. Battery life was great too. I only had to change the batteries once in 9 months. That's not bad when you consider how many people were coming and going throughout the day and night."
1,Does not work,"I purchased one of these and loved the design. Unfortunately, it did not work so I sent it back. I ordered another one and this one did not work either. Enough said."
1,a piece of crap,It worked for two weeks and stopped. The light is much less than a small candle. It would not provide safety for walking more than 5 feet from it. Don't waste your time or money on such a shoddy piece crap.
2,Worked great for about a month..,"I used this in my bathroom so don't have to turn light on in middle of night, and it worked great for a month or so. Then all of a sudden it stopped so i figured it was the batteries but after putting new ones in i found the sensor was not working anymore."
3,"suspenseful, and a bit graphic!","I picked this up because the catchy title. I was hard to put down in the begining, but towards the end it wasn't as good. It was kinda confusing, I would have prefered something gothic, but it was pretty good overall. I just loved the main heroine, whatta change. I'm glad see found out how to have a good time, if you get me. now it needs a sequel!!"
4,Ardeth Rocks!,"This is a great book full of romance and suspense. Nancy Baker is a talented author when it comes to writing about vampires and I hope that one day I will be as good as her. If you want to read other books by her, I strongly suggest ""A Terrible Beauty"". It is my favourite book by her followed by this book. Ardeth is the kind of girl we all want to be: strong, fearless and courages. Dimitri is the kind of guy all girls want: sweet, caring, tough, and a bit scary:)! To all who read it, enjoy!"
4,Interesting and worth a visit,Interesting story and characters. Definitely worth reading more than once.
4,"An engrossing, terrible, sad, beautiful tale.","Not normally a vampire story fan, I found I couldn't put this book down (called ""The Night Inside"" in Canada). Like the two books after this (""Blood and Chrysanthemums"", and ""A Terrible Beauty""), Ms Baker has a way of creating sympathetic anti-heroes out of her vampire characters.I highly recommend this as an engrossing story you can lose yourself in. Fans of the genre, and people who normally steer clear of horror will love this book!"
4,Read this book!,"I liked it -because- it wasn't like Anne Rice. The original title was better, because while the book involves vampires, it's more of an unlikely, and very moving, love story involving people who are very different from each other. It also raised some interesting questions -what does it mean to be human? How does one remain ethical in an unethical world? Is individual suffering enough of an excuse for inflicting pain on others?"
5,Such a joy to read!,"This is one of my favorite ""new"" childrens' books! The illustrations are bright, interesting, and engaging. Even better, the story is so inspiring for adults and children alike. ""Anyone can dance if they just find their own song."" A book I would readily gift to any child."
5,Wonderfully written; invaluable message,"I'm a mother of three (and also a psychologist) and I'm constantly looking for childrens' books that inspire and promote self esteem. This book is a gem and I absolutely love it! The powerful, invaluble message rings loud and clear - ""we all can dance when we find music that we love."""
3,"Okay for toddlers, better for preschoolers","Cute book about dancing - not an easy topic to find for toddlers who love dancing. Good read-aloud level for 2 year old, nice pictures, easy to follow story and a great John Travolta/Saturday Night Fever pose by Gerald at the end. Includes peer group of animals who laugh at the giraffe for not being able to dance, which is a social concept that I had reservations about exposing to our 2 year old but may be okay for an older preschooler. So, I read it with reservations at first, but it seems to be okay for him. However, he's not enjoying the book as much as I am and hasn't been interested in hearing it much beyond the first couple of times."
5,I read this book to my disabled child (4 years old),"This is a wonderful book about a Gerald, a giraffe who attempts to dance at the yearly jungle dance, but shies away from the stage when other animals laugh at him. This book express beautifully how it feels to be different - 'Gerald had never felt so sad and so alone' - and ends on a very positive note: 'Sometimes when you're different, you just need a different song' and 'we all can dance, when we find music that we love.' It was a perfect book to help my child with his feelings towards his weakness."
5,Excellent read,Great descriptive and emotive text. Provides real feeling for a situation of exclusion for an individual. Very well put together
3,great story and pictures,Had to tape the cover to the spine! Sorry! The condition of the book made it a difficult gift to give.
5,Cutest Book!!,My toddler loves this book. We have to read it over and over. My copy is actually falling apart beccause it is used so much! A great purchase for toddlers!! Really holds their attention span..
2,Giraffes can't dance and 3-yr olds couldn't care less,"I was disappointed, to say the least. It's recommended for 3- yr. olds. The wording is uninspired; the vocabulary too advanced for this age; the drawings convoluted - not clear to make out, unappealing; the colors dull. I was unable after much effort to engage the attention of a very bright 3-yr old girl for more than 5 minutes.Giraffes Can't Dance"
2,watch out for awesomebooks.com,"The book came in a cardboard envelope too small for the book so it wouldn't seal properly. The pages of the book were completely separated from the cover. Not sure if it was damaged in the mail or if they shipped it already damaged. Very disappointed. Since I ordered this as a present and I'm on a deadline, I didn't want to waste time trying to return it and replace it, so I was able to glue the pages back into the cover. I wouldn't want to order from Awesomebooks.com again."
5,Love it,This is a wonderful book. I purchased this for my niece. She loves to read and will love the humor and illustrations.
4,Great read,"My 4 year old daughter loves this book. She loves Giraffes, especially a Giraffe that can dance! She wants me to read it to her every night."
5,Find your own music and dance!,"My daughter and I love this book! A very sweet story about Gerald the Giraffe who is clumsy and can't dance until he finds his own music. A wonderful story about being unique and finding your own ""music"". Nice rhyming story and beautiful illustrations."
4,A really nice story,"We bought this for our granddaughter who loves giraffes. It's a story with several levels, but right now the major attraction for her is that it's a story about a giraffe!"
2,I did Not like this Book,"I understand that the author is making a debut here, but someone (his editor? his therapist?) made a grave error is launching this book for publication before its time. It could easily be two books. More likely, it could be one, shorter and (dare I say it) linear tale of his family shenanigans. Cut out the William-Faulkner-and-James-Joyce-collaborate-on-stream-of consciousness passages, get rid of them like the fat on a big hog ready for throwing on the fire. That's what I think"
4,Necessary Reading to Correct False Views on Language,"Linguists (especially English-speaking ones) would do well to look to the Japanese language and test their theories against it *first* before making o'erhasty generalizations about language. I turned to this book after reading Anna Wierzbicka's work on 'semantic universals' and found that it validated my ideas that there is no exact equivalent in the Japanese language for the English word 'you' (or 'Du' in German, 'tu' in French, etc.). However, Shibatani's work is enjoyable and very informative. Non-linguists can (I think) understand it without much difficulty, and students of Japanese (as well as native speakers!) may enjoy his overview of the history and development of the language. He also goes out of his way to disprove certain 'myths' about Japanese. Plus it has a bibliography of works in both Japanese and English.I sincerely hope more books of this kind will emerge."
5,Jesus on Trial,Certainly a book worthy of the topic. Should be in a church library or a clergy libraryHighly recommended to adults and youth
5,all right by me !!!,"This huge 16 ounce mug by Pfaltzgraff truly IS a man sized mug! However, you don't have to tell that to your female guests--everyone is sure to appreciate this sturdy mug that can hold anything you serve to your guests. (All right, so it isn't perfect for serving liquor, but we knew that already!) Pfaltzgraff manufacturers this mug to be durable so it can stand the test of time--this is nothing cheaply made.The ""Sedona"" style mug is indeed dishwasher and microwave safe. The manufacturer claims that it is also oven and freezer safe; but I can't comment on that because I haven't used it in the oven and freezer.The warm, earthy tones of this mug certainly do give it that vibrant southwest feel; and the design can go with many contemporary and even modern dining room sets.The mug is hand painted; that impresses me. There is a five year warranty but with the great design of these mugs I doubt you'll ever need it!Get a set of these mugs today--and enjoy!"
3,Very Nice......But......,"This is a lovely, high quality mug. I love the design and colors on it. I just have one problem with it - it is too heavy for me to use when it is full or half-full of my coffee!!! I am a senior citizen my hands have lost the strength they had in my younger days. So holding this mug is uncomfortable for me as it seems very heavy to me. This is in no way a bad reflection on the mug. If you are a woman with limited strength in your hands, I would advise against this mug. It is much larger than a typical coffee cup and due to its being stoneware, it is very hefty in weight. Other than its weight it is a beautiful mug!!!"
3,very dissapointed,This huge 16 ounce mug by Pfaltzgraff truly is truly a man sized mug!My feedback is based on the fact that I could not find where it was manufactured.Pfaltzgraff has been an American tradition for almost two centuries.I did try to find out the country of manufacture and had made my purchase based on the quality of the name.When the mugs came in I found they were actually made in China; and now I question the quality and safety.I try not to buy items made in China because of their politics and child labor policies.Had I known they were manufactured in China I WOULD NOT have made the purchase.
2,wasn't what I expected from the series,I have had a lot better results from this series with other products... but this fail short. Perhaps because it's more than one program into one book. It's not thorough and it's pretty basic!
5,Nice Kit,"This kit is a nice Soyo motherboard, power supply, and ATX case. It is well put together with the motherboard and power supply in the case and ready for a CPU and peripherals. The item was shipped very quickly, and I am very happy. Buy with confidence from this seller!"
5,Oral Ivy,"Oral Ivy has greatly helped my wife avoid poison ivy outbreaks. I work outside a lot, so she probably gets it from handling my clothing. If she forgets to take Oral Ivy and gets an outbreak, then she takes it to decrease the severity. The last couple of times she had poison ivy outbreaks before oral ivy, she had to go to the doctor for steroid shots, but not after starting Oral Ivy.I was introduced to this product by a church friend who used to work in electric utility industry with crews that often came in contact with poison ivy. They had good success with using Oral Ivy. I read the research on the product and it indicated it didn't work for everyone, but was very helpful for a large percentage of those tested. It was so cheap, I thought it was worth a try. A single bottle lasts over a year for my wife, so it is very inexpensive."
5,Oral Ivy highly rated by tree care professionals,"At York Tree Service, Inc., our tree care professionals use Oral Ivy regularly to prevent poison ivy outbreaks. Our operations crews, who often perform utility line clearance, have frequent contact with poison ivy plants. Clearing trees and brush away from power lines is risky enough. With Oral Ivy, contact with poison ivy is one less hazard to be concerned about!"
1,Stay Away,"This product made my poison ivy spread rapidly. Within an hour of taking. I could see the rash spreading. If you are Highly allergic to poison ivy, I would stay away away from this product."
2,"All I know is I'm still itchy, and I've still got poison ivy.","There's no way to tell if I'd be any worse if I hadn't been using this, but I've had both feet covered in poison ivy for about 2 weeks now. I work in a wood shop all day, have to keep boots on. I can change my socks once or twice a day and apply calimine, but I've been taking 12 drops every 2 hours for 2 weeks and it's only gotten worse.Who knows, maybe I'd be covered head to toe and this stuff kept it from spreading. Wish there was a way to tell for sure, so I feel bad giving it 2 stars, but I feel like 3 would be wimping out. I won't be buying this again and I won't recommend it to anyone.I was into homeopathic medicine years ago, I've even made my own tinctures in the past. I think I've got an open mind to this stuff, I'm just not seeing the results I was hoping for."
3,Didn't work on poison oak,"Had a real, real bad rash of poison oak not Poison Ivy on my arms, legs and private parts, paid for overnight delivery and got it the next day. Used it as recommend, but it had no affect, i'm not sure if this product was intended for poison oak."
1,not work for me,"I had the poison ivy rash on my arm and leg, it is very itchy, so I started to look for something great to make me feel better. I saw this product have a good review and I ordered one bottle with one-day delivery service from Amazon. But unfortunately this production not work for me at all, disappointed!"
5,Thank God,"This stuff is a miracle. I am extremely allergic to poison oak and i get it pretty much every summer from hiking, from the dogs, from whatever. Im usually a skeptic on homeopathic meds, but i started taking this and i havent gotten a single sign of the rash. It works so well i tempted fate and went on a hike through heavy poison oak areas in shorts with my dog at my side. A week and a half later and i have absolutely nothing! I heard it works good if you already have the rash as well but i dont think im going to have a chance to find out! THANK YOU ORAL IVY!!"
5,"So far, so good...","I started taking this product about three weeks ago, after suffering 2 extreme bouts of poison ivy from working in my yard. Last week, I was once again exposed to poison ivy, but this time, instead of developing a severe rash, I only had 2 small bumps, which were only slightly itchy, and completely faded after 2 days. I strongly feel that if I had not been taking this product, I would have suffered my usual reaction to poison ivy."
5,Another useful link in the strat chain,"The other review pretty much sums it all up. This isnt a book to discover when your strat pickguard screws were manufactured or at what time of morning Leo Fender drank his coffee. But there is a nice dose of comments from all the major players at the Fender company (Don Randal, etc.) ..and from the major players of the strat too, for that matter. Its a good book to have. On a personal level I got a kick out of the author commenting in passing that Yngwie Malmsteen's songwriting skills unfortunately lagged behind his solo playing. So true. Theres few or no strat revelations in this book, but its a good effort nonetheless. A page turner."
3,Simple is not always best,"While the book is well-written and has great information, I found it to be too basic of an overview. It is a wonderful resource for someone starting in the hobby, or for people wishing to learn more about certain fish (the fish section is packed with information). However, I found the information on tanks and equipment lacked in-depth coverage."
3,I expected more,I thought that this book would have more about different types of fish and who they really get along best with. Its an ok book for newbies but I would go to the library first and check it out before buying.
1,"Nice place to start, but need more","This book has a nice layout, nice pictures and good summary on fishes it carries. Unfortunately, tries to cover both fresh and salt water and has very entries of either. The tank equipment and setup guides do not go into any real detail and major things such as live rock are left out entirely for marine setups. This might be good to start interest, but don't try to setup a tank with this alone, or you may leave the hobby for good after frustrating problems and losses occur."
3,Could have been better.,"Unlike Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, My Perfect Life (sequel to Confessions) is not narrated by Lola Cep; rather it is narrated by Ella Gerard. Because, in both of these novels, Lola is the Drama queen & Ella is the laidback type, I do personally believe that it was more exciting to hear the story from Lola's point of view. However, I do have to say that My Perfect Life has a perfect plot and a perfect ending! Although it was predictable. I recommend this read to anyone between the ages of 12-16."
2,review on my perfect life,ella had the most perfect life... untill she met lola. lola mad her run against the most popular girl in school for school president.this book was kind of weird.... i didnt think it really had a point... it kept on reperting itself...
4,My Perfect Life,"I enjoyed this book, however, it wasn't anywhere near being as good as the first. It wasn't as funny as Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, but there were still some pretty funny parts in it. I thought she did an OK job mixing serious stuff with funny stuff, and even though I liked how it was written from Ella's point of view instead of Lola's, it did make things a little less interesting. Overall I thought it was good, though."
4,good,Don't cha hate it when people never give anything a chance? the book was good overall. I suggest read the book Confession of a teenage drama queen than seeing the movie. u get a better perspective
4,My Perfect Life,"I thought that this book was a great book. I dont like reading at all, but once I picked this book up, I couldnt stop reading it. Its a good book; great for teenagers."
5,So Far So Good,"I have purchased the Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digital Ultra II for my newly acquired Kodak 7590 digital camera. So far I have no problem with it. I also use it on my Toshiba notebook which has a built-in SD-card reader. So far it works fine on the notebook computer too. I have read customers' review for the Sandisk 256 MB Secure Digital Ultra II. People were complaining about the card went dead on them after some time of use and they are returning the card for refund. I hope this will not happen to me.So far, I am very happy with it. It stores more than 200 pictures at 5MP @ Fine JPEG Compression. As for the speed of the card. I can't really tell the difference when I compare it with a regular Sandisk 512 MB Secure Digital card. Both seems to work just as fast in the digital camera and the notebook computer."
5,"Very fast, highly reliable.",I bought this memory card for my Panasonic Lumix F20 on the recommendation of a friend. I tried it out on continous mode to take pictures of pelicans in flight at Monterey. Each frame came out beautifully. You can clearly see their wings flap. Great buy.
1,Disappointed,"This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii. Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD."
5,512 MB secure digtal ultra II,If you want lots of space on your memory stick...this is the one for you!
3,Buyers beware.,"If you decide to buy this Ultra SD Sandisk card, make sure you have the newer Sandisk card reader. I have the Sandisk model SDDR-73 card reader and couldn't read the photos taken on this card. Evidently, my card reader needs a firmware upgrade that is not available on the SanDisk site. I wrote the tech support from SanDisk and they are bunch of idiots. They told me to return the ultra SD and sent me another one. When I got the replacement ultra SD card, it also would not read on my card reader. I know my older card reader is not defective because it can read my non-ultra SD cards. Finally, I had to buy the SanDisk 8 in 1 card Reader/Writer which can read this stupid card. This Ultra Card doesn't seems to record photos with my digital camera any faster than my non ultra SD card.Kevin"
4,So far so good,"I looked at and read about and price shopped SD cards until until I was exhausted, then I went with a name brand and been satisfied."
4,ROMANTIC,"The performances are very good. A standout is Gerard Oury, a French actor playing the Dauphin of France. The film has a 50's feel with its glamour makeup and clothing, but the story is good and based on the life of Henry VIII's sister. The music is beautiful as are the dances in Henry's court."
5,The Sword and the Rose Now Available on DVD!,"The Sword and the Rose is available on DVD as an exclusive release via the Disney Movie Club as of December 14, 2010!Darby"
1,Poor quality - item was defective out of the box,This edger appeared to have a bolt missing from the engine casing that caused it to leak oil as soon as started. Yard Machines customer service referred me to a local merchant for a repair. That merchant told me they were not certified to work on the engine and most likely the engine gasket would need replaced due to the severity of the oil leak. The product is being returned to Amazon.com for a refund.
4,So far so good,"Only used once but love it! My last edger, a Poulan/Weed Eater literally fell apart during the first use. This Yard Machine is effotless to push down the sidewalk, cuts a good groove, and has an adjustable wheel for using on the curb. Only one use but so far so good!"
2,NOT VERY HAPPY,THE ITEM WAS NOT DELIVERED IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE COST OF SHIPPING WAS NOT AS STATED. THE ITEM WAS DAMAGED INTRANSIT OR DAMAGED PRIOR TO SHIPPING.
5,Air Bed,This product was shipped 100% faster than I ever expected. I'm extremely satisfied with this product. I will buy from this person again.
2,Not for long term occasional use,We bought a version of this a few years ago to use for guests and after just having used it last night the guests had to actually crawl onto the sofa half way through the night. We've noticed for a while it wasn't holding air well but it wasn't even sleepable after a few hours. We're disappointed because this was rarely used but much needed when it was and now we have to purchase another one. Otherwise we really liked it but something about it just makes it not hold air which defeats the purpose!
4,Best night sleep not at home!,"This is no ordinary air mattress... Having the frame eliminates droopy sides... Comfortably slept two people, and sometimes two toddlers! Did not refill air for our entire trip! (4 nights) Great height for sitting on as well!We have tried regular air mattresses, double high, queen size cots... All different brands... NOTHING has compared.ONLY drawbacks:Pump isn't the strongest, but did the job just fine.A little bulky to storeI would buy this again a million times over! Great find - great deal"
4,comfortable bed,"Only used it once so far but it worked great. Pump seems pretty cheesy though, had to hold the attatchment onto it while inflating :(otherwise it seemed to work well"
3,Not the best.,"Great concept to have a bed inside a frame. This happened to be my favorite part because the sheets stayed on perfectly. But the frame made this bed very large, so unless you have a large room with close to nothing in it, it'll be a challenge to put somewhere. Wasn't too comfortable either. We purchased this as a temporary replacement for our old mattress while we were waiting for our new one. Slept on it for 2 days and my husband and I just tossed and turned like crazy. Had my dad sleep on it a few weeks ago, but he didn't complain. It is a lot more comfortable with just one person on it, but then, what's the purpose of a queen size bed if only one person is comfortable sleeping on it?"
5,Intex Comfort Frame Rising Comfort Queen Airbed with hand held A/C Pump,"This is our camping bed. Our friends tease us everytime we set our camp site, we are the butt of their jokes untill the next morning. We get up all fresh and well slept and they crawl out of their tents all stiff and sore. Now who is laughing! Hehehe. It does go down, but I fill it up just before we go to sleep. Besides anything that can make me and my husband comfortable (combined weight about 200kg) must be good!"
4,Comfy Queen Air Mattress,"We are very pleased with this air bed. It is comfortable, and can be used as 2 air mattresses if need be. The mattress in a frame make it much more stable than a regular air mattress. (No rolling off the sides or to the center) Sheets stay on and tucked in like a real bed! Bolster holds pillows in place."
3,could be better,"I bought this bed about a month ago to have in my apartment until I could afford to buy a real bed. I planned on using it for a few months and then storing it to have for guest use. Now that I have been using it I really want a real bed as soon as soon as possible. I'm not a big person, and I have had to add quite a bit of air to the bed about every 2-3 nights. I tried to let it go longer than that and it was horrible!! I can't find a specific leak, I think it has to be something with the design of the bed because both the frame and the bed need extra air every couple of nights.On the plus side, it came with the pump and is very easy to use. I also like that I can tuck of the bed right into the frame. It is pretty comfortable for an airbed (when fully inflated)."
4,Intex Air Mattress,"One of my friends has this air mattress so I was able to try it out before I purchased it. It was certainly the most comfortable air mattress that I have ever slept on to the point where I would consider it as comfortable if not more comfortable than my own bed. The only issue that I had with the air mattress was the pump seemed to take a long time to inflate it (especially with the two parts); however, the pump did get the job done. I highly recommend this product."
4,Comfortable Bed,"Bed consists of two seperate peices that are inflated seperately. The ""mattress"" portion holds air very well, however, the ""frame"" portion is usually a little mushy by the morning. This is not a problem if you inflate fully before going to sleep and it easily gets us through the night.Overall a great bed for the price. Recommended."
2,air leaked before first use,"After unpacking and setting up for guests for the first time, I could hear air escaping out of the base valve. I don't have much faith in the way the valve just clips in place. I couldn't get the air to stop coming out no matter how much I tried to secure the valve properly. I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed in this product for the price. Hopefully they start using a different valve design."
1,Lame low budget movie !,"I bought this one in the hope of seeing a good suspense thriller with certain horror elements in it. Instead I got a lame low budget film, that started off a bit interesting but soon lost all appeal for me. The main reason for this is that before the main character, a woman, embarks on her trip to England she is captured at night by an assailant, who then ties her to a wall in an unknown place. What might at this point still sound good, is simply from the capture scenes onward boring and tedious to watch. After this the whole movie is set in a dungeon where the abductor preys on his new victim, which is really not in the least exciting to watch and one just wants to desperately press that stop botton on the DVD player.Hence, this DVD was neither a thriller nor a real horror movie, but instead something terribly boring.P.S. Avoid this one virtually at all cost."
1,School Assignment Book,"This book was for my entering-high school son, who found its not well written or interesting. Since he's a regular reader who loves stuff from Harry Potter to mysteries, it's worth noting."
4,My review,The book I did was Look whos playing first base. Have ever moved from another country to the USA? Yuri has. Yuri is a boy from Russiu and ther he meets a boy named Mike and when he met Yuri he was tossing a ball against a wall and Mike said hey whatsup and asked yuri if he would like to play first base man on there team couse the last first base man moved away. There teams name is the checkmates.and Yuri was left handed and left handes are best at first base.And then yuri turned out to benot to good.The only reason he got to stay on the team is becouse of his bat and he always hits home runs. and Don the teams catcher threatend to quit and so he did but if you want find out if he comes back and if they win there last game.Something speciel is that it teaches you about sportsmanship and that winning is not everything also that you should never leave your real frends.You sould read this book and alot of the other matt christofer books couase they are exiting and touching.
3,I think it was fun.,"Have you ever met someone from a different country and you make a new friend? Well,a boy named Mike meets a new boy from Russia and his name is Yuri. Mike and Yuri are on the same baseball team. The team they're are on is the Checkmates. Don,who is on the team doesn't like Yuri and quits the team. Will Don ever come back to the team? Read ""Look Who's Playing First Base"" to find out what happens next."
1,Not Heavy Weight - stamped Medium,"I ordered 2 dozen of these forks. When they arrived the boxes and each fork were stamped medium weight, NOT heavy weight which is what I ordered and paid for. I tried to contact the seller several times to discuss this issue, but they never responded. Order at your own risk."
4,Great but bulky,"The photo makes it look slim and more portable. Actual product is a lot more bulky. But it is just a pen, so I'm not too picky about it.It says it has ""smear guard"" but depending on what kind of paper you're using this on, I would still wait a few seconds before touching it. It does smear on my semi-glossy textbook pages, if I try touching it immediately after I use it. So, use common sense. That said, the markings did dry VERY QUICKLY, and even though it was not 100% smear proof, a light ""dab"" of the finger would not have created disaster on your page.It glides very easily across the page, very smooth. I liked it a lot. However, again, the types of paper will effect it. Overall, it's a great product!So long as you don't press down too hard, it doesn't seem to bleed through the pages very much.Now, the picture shown on my computer shows much brighter colors. The actual product I received seemed to have much darker colors, almost marker-like. FYI."
4,They do the job for me,"These highlighter pens work nicely, for me. I've been using them mostly to highlight the stitches on knitted lace charts to help me keep track of the different stitches. Before, some of the charts would give me a good deal of eye strain, now it's easier to see the different knit stitches. I think it would help on some of the black & white cross stitch charts too.The darker blue and the indigo are a bit dark like others have mentioned. So I don't think I'd use those colors to highlight something I need to read, like in a text book. It's nice that they are in a handy plastic sleeve to keep them all together, and I really like how they are rectractable."
2,Several improvements needed,"These are okay, but could use several improvements.1) Make them brighter.As mentioned in other reviews, the colors are on the darker side.2) Make them smaller.The tip and the mechanism that holds the tip are only in the bottom quarter of the highlighter. The button at the top and the extra space in the middle could be decreased in size. A highlighter 3/4 the size would fit in a lot more small pockets in backpacks.3) Decrease the sound of the click.I like to click them closed while I'm looking for the next part to highlight. It's a habit that I have to consciously stop myself from doing to avoid annoying other people around me. Not sure if it can be done, but if the click can be muted even a little bit, that would help."
4,Very Essential for Studying,"Shipped earlier than expected, the different colors really help when trying to study because I can separate different focus points and help organize thoughts. I also find that colors in general really help with cognitive memory of subjects studied which has shown to improve test scores."
2,smudge free they are not,"My wife owns just about every Sharpies product ever made so I jumped at the chance to try these accent markers. Unfortunately, one of the features that these markers are supposed to have is smudge free on any ink surface. I have a HP Photosmart inkjet printer and my wife got tons of streaking as well as absoprtion using these accent markers. She had printed some of her school lessons about 2 hours before using the Sharpie's on them but the ink still smudged across the paper and some of the ink absorbed into the Sharpie.. Other documents worked fine but beware if you use an inkjet printer!"
3,A little too dark for highlighters,"These are a little too dark for highlighters. The lighter colors, like yellow, pink, and light blue work okay, but the darker colors are not useful. The only way I can use these and still be able to read the text is to underline rather than high light, which I can do easier with a gel pin. The highlighters are also really wet. If I try to highlight a larger area there is a lot of page warping and bleed through.These are okay, but I can't recommend them."
3,"Retractable is an Advantage, but some negatives too","Love Sharpie products, but I think they somewhat missed the 'mark' on these highlighters.First of all: they are too big and bulky. I have fairly large hands, and I find them to be too thick and long for a highlighter. None of my writing devices are this large so why should I carry around a highlighter that's even larger. The chiseled tip of the highlighter allows you to make a thin or thick underline or highlight but it's a bit awkward to find the side you want.What I like:They don't smear, this is a great featureThey are retractable..They come in a great assortment of colorsAND if I were a geek with a pocket protector, the clip makes it easy to slide into the pocket of a shirt....definite geek advantage"
5,"Nice design, works well",Very clever design... wonder why no one did this before. Cross between a retractable pen and a highlighter. No more losing highlighter caps or having them on loose and drying out. Works as advertised
2,First time Sharpie!,"I'd never used Sharpie highlighters before. (STAEDTLER highlighters are usually my choice.) I bought the product solely because they are retractable highlighters. It is a feature I wished highlighters would have. So, I tried. The product serves its purpose. Very convenient and fun to use. But I am not impressed with its performance. The line is too thin and the ink dried out quickly after continuously used for about an hour. Some colors are too dark so I have to use them to underline texts instead. They are not terrible products but they are not my cup of tea. I definitely prefer STEADTLER highlighters than this product."
4,Great Idea!,"Pros:-Love simple but great ideas. I am a klutz, so there are more than a few times I lose the cap of my markers or forget to seal it back. This is not as bad for a ballpoint pens, but for markers, forget it. Next day, the tip is as dry as a board.-It is a one-piece writing device.Cons:-Tip is a wedge and not the round types, so you need to position the marker properly in your hand to use it.-You still need to remember to click it back to retract. :)"
4,"Pretty colors, not really good for highlighting","I'm a fan of Sharpie, so I thought I would give these highlighters a try.The good: I like that they are retractable (why hasn't anyone done this before!?!?) and the ink is pretty much smear-proof except on cash register receipts (I tested them on several different kinds of paper). I also like that there are a variety of colors if you need to color-code a report or similar. The case is a nice touch so you can keep them all together.The bad: the variety of colors. The red, dark blue, and purple are not good for highlighting - you can't really see through them. The green and light blue are iffy. (They work great as markers, though!) The pink, orange and yellow work well as highlighters.A small, irritating thing - all of the typos on the packaging!!!"
2,Run out quickly,I don't think the convenience of the retractable feature is worth the price nor the limited time it actually stayed wet.
4,"Minimal smearing, & most colors are bright & readable",Used these on regular paper & books.Most colors are bright & readable. The only ones I had problems reading were the red & purple because they were a bit dark.There was minimal smearing although there was a bit more smearing if the ink on written papers wasnt completely 100% dry.Overall an OK highlighter set that got the job done. Would probably buy again.
3,Nice variety but still disappointing,"I really like the variety of colors in this set. However, what is disappointing is that several colors are more ""marker-like"" than highliter. Once they dry, all colors are ok for being able to read the underlying text, but the indigo and purple are a little dark. These are more fine tipped than you big, normal highliter, but they do get the job done.These are functional, but nothing to rave about."
2,Don't last long,"I bought these highlighters thinking that because they are made by Sharpie they would be of good quality. I was disappointed in the fact that they didn't last very long at all. I used these to highlight in a text book. I was unable to stretch the yellow to do 1 chapter, it dried out very quickly. All told, these highlighters lasted less than a week. Next time I'm going to be purchasing the liquid highlighters by Sharpie - they last much longer."
2,Need more juice,"Other reviews are right when they say these don't smear and work well but these highlighters also run out incredibly quickly compared to other brands. If you're someone who uses a highlighter every day, expect about 10 days out of each one."
2,Eh....,"We didn't like these sharpies. The colors were ok, it needs a true purple instead of a pink and a magenta. The tips were uncomfortable to color or write with. We did, however, like that they are retractable. We tried them for a bit then gave them to the receptionist at school who was very happy to get them."
5,Impressive highlighters!!,Superlative state-of-the art highlighters. I tried them on inkjet printouts and there was no smearing or ink uptake in the marker itself. Very nice colors and packaging as well.
3,Good but not great...,"I do like the idea of retractable markers -- no caps to lose as my kids often do. I thought the colors would be fun but in person, most of them are quite dark and makes it hard to read through what you're highlighting. That could be due to my advanced age and not perfect eyesight. I think kids would find the colors fun but for me most are too hard to see through easily. They do not smear so that's a plus. Some of them seemed to not draw the same width line each time which can be annoying. My 13 year old likes a lot of the colors and will enjoy using them."
1,Disappointing,The book was disappointing because it was mostly all photos and captions. I was looking for something more serious about navigating in a yacht through wind and fog in the San Francisco Bay Area.
4,Good easy listening CD,"The Goombay Dance Band would appear to have two CDs with the same title, however, this CD has only 10 tracks, whereas the other CD has 16 tracks. Everything on this CD is included on the other CD with the exceptions of ""Sunny Caribbean"", ""Blue Night of Hawaii"" and ""Goombay Dance"". Both CDs are mildly lively and easy on the ears. The selections on this CD, as with the other CD with the same title, are in the same vein as ""Guantanamera"", though it is not included on either CD. (It was on the ""Best of the Goombay Dance Band"" cassette.) I have that cassette, as well as both of the CDs with the ""Sun of Jamaica"" title and all 3 are pleasant and easy listening."
3,"Good, readable book on fascinating subject","This was a very informative, readable book. Wishes I have though are for pictures and descriptions of philosophical/theological differences between the different Hasidic courts. I think there was too much about various conflicts between the rival groups."
5,GOING HOME,"CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT WHEELER'S BOOKS.I HAVE READ ALMOST ALL OF HIS SKYE NOVELS, ALL ARE A PLUS. IF YOU WANT A LITTLE INSIGHT OF THE OLD WEST, WITH WHITE MANS, INTERCHANGE WITH THE INDIANS.IN MY OPINION A PAGE TURNER."
3,"Von Luckner fans, beware","""Shark! Shark!"" itself isn't bad, and provides an interesting look at sharks through the eyes of an experienced shark hunter.NOTE: This book is frequently found advertised in searches of antiquarian books as ""by Felix von Luckner"" - be aware that only the introduction (and a short one) was written by Graf von Luckner. Don't buy this as a von Luckner book or you will be disappointed. Buy it instead as a fairly well writen book about sharks and the Pacific islands of the early 1900's, and enjoy it for that."
2,Regurgitation of LRM,"This book is basically a regurgitation of the language reference manual and really does not give the reader any insight into when and how to use particular language constructs. For example on page 148 the author discusses module ports and has an example of a port redeclaration, but he neglects to discuss why you would wish to redeclare a port as a wire. If you are learning Verilog because you are going to use it in an actual design look elsewhere."
3,A little disappointed,"With such a high rating, I had hoped for something better.If you are looking for a very introductory lesson on the workings of Verilog, this is for you. However if you are looking for something that will help you learn to write complex code, this is not it.My biggest complaint is that this book needs to be hit pretty hard by an editor who actually understands Verilog enough to find the syntax errors and omissions in the example code. If this is supposed to be a ""primer"" all of the examples should be technically and syntactically correct, and they are not. I am able to find mistakes and this is my first foray into Verilog.Also note: this does not teach anything about synthesizable code. That's another book, but the difference is never even mentioned. Almost everything in this book will help you learn how to write test benches for you synthesizable modules."
5,A must have book,"While some might say that it's a beginners' book, you willend up using this book the most. I have several Verilogbooks in my cube at my work, but this is the book mycolleagues come very often to look up. This has excellentand authentic descriptions of all Verilog language rulesand primitives. It also explains how and when to usedifferent Verilog constructs. I bet you will not regrethaving this book."
3,Not a very good book,"Occasionally you see books that seem to be compiled by the author's lecture notes, this is one of them. It would still be ok if the notes were good, however this one isn't. It does it's job presenting the basics of Verilog, but on harder to understand concepts such as blocking/non-blocking procedural assignments and procedural continuous assignment, the author does an aweful job explaining it, which is where it counts the most. Similar problems appear throughout the book, and I can never understand why it has attained a four star rating, which is when I purchased it. If you can find a better book, go for it!"
5,In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower,"The book, In The Shadow of Young in Flower was in excellent condition. Proust is exceptional in every way. I will buy again."
2,"Well named, but the joke is on the buyer","Like the old joke about Chinese Food, ""Eat and half an hour later, you're hungry again"", this book leaves a reader with the sense that the money for the book was not well spent.With Abercrombie & Fitch catalogues and at least a dozen fashion-oriented magazines featuring photography that's as good (or better, depending on your tastes and preferences), this book is not worth getting excited aobut...probably the reason it's out of print.David Morgan, Patrick McMullan, Bel Ami, and several other photographers have far better 'product' availabl..."
5,hero,Wow. For those who enjoy black and white photography at its best. This man knows how to get inside of his subjects and print their souls like no other.
5,Best delay pedal I have EVER used!,"I bought this pedal when it was still in production (it's now a discontinued item). As a performing musician, I don't think you can get a better pedal for the price. This thing is incredible. The delay in this unit compares to high end pedals that cost 3 or 4 times the price. After my first DE7 burned out (I plugged the wrong AC adaptor into it) they stopped production on it and I couldn't find it anywhere. Looking back on live videos of myself using it, I realized how amazing this pedal was. I'm glad I was able to find it again! Buy this pedal. You will NOT be dissappointed."
5,Beast Master...,"This is THE beast master of all delays and echos! The creamyness and dreamyness I get from this unit never cease to amaze me; I never turn it off!All I really have to do is feed it, batteries; even with the remote power unit hooked-up to it?!Just feed it!"
5,This is the greatest wash ever!,"This produce really works, and really works fast. No scrubbing. Just spray on, wait and rinse off. My horse is a real dust bunny and after a hard workout, all that dust turns to mud all over. I just spray, rinse and squeege and she clean. My trainer turned me on to it and he said, since he started using it twice a week on his horses, he has noticed a big reduction in the amount of flies in his barn. He thinks it's because there is nothing on the horses for them to eat since the dirt and sweat is gone. I really recommend this product."
1,Will not reliably play back self recorded dvd's,"I have tried 2 samples of this player and I am now sending back the second one, this time for a refund instead of an exchange. Both samples mistracked (skipped and froze) on a number of self recorded dvd-r discs that 3 other players that I have (older Panasonic DVD-S35,DVD-F85) and (newer Sony DVD-NS50P) tracked without any problems at all. These dvd-r's were recorded on top quality media (Taiyo Yuden and Ritek) using an NEC or Pioneer 108 dvd writer in my computer. I recommend that anyone who records their own dvd's should buy any dvd player only with a return privilage and test it with their own self recorded discs. For those who do not require playback of self recorded dvd's this player has many features but for my needs it failed."
4,"Again, great player for the money","As someone else pointed out, the door does not slide out all of the way. It's not been any issue to me so far.Otherwise, it's played just about everything I have put in to it so far. I replaced my Pioneer DV-563A-s with this updated player (for Divx compatibility) and there is very little difference between the two, when it comes to using them. The 588 is smaller than the 563 but all the menus are identical.All in all a very good DVD player that fits just about anywhere."
5,Pioneer DV-588A-S Slim Progressive Scan DVD Player,Perfect Item & Fast Shipping. Excellent DVD player - very satisfied with product.
3,Good FBI transcripts,"It's an average mafia book with good details. The good details come from the fact that Anastasia has actual transcripts from the FBI wiretappings of the Philly mob. Don't make much of an effort to read, unless you really like the Philly mob."
1,A viewer from Los Angeles,This movie is no way like the original the Killers (1989) movie due to the fact that Killers 2 is an old movie created in late 1970s when Chow Yun Fat was starting his career in the movie industries. I returned the movie back and get my refund back. This video is a rip-off using the actors name. It should have 0 star instead.
1,DANGER! THIS MOVIE WAS HAS NOTHNG TO DO WITH THE FIRST!,"THE PEOPLE WHO PRINTED THIS THING SHOULD BE SLAPPED FOR TRYING TO PASS IT OFF HAS A SEQUEL. IT HAS THE ACTORS , BUT ITS DAMN FUNNY IT WAS MADE BEFORE THE FIRST ONE, WAY BACK IN THE FRIGGIN 70'S! IF I COULD FIND'EM I'D KICK THERE $%^&%^*&(^&*$#%&%*^&(.........."
3,Warning!,This title is available from the Warner Archive site directly for only $19.95. Why pay more?
2,"Very dumb, but the cast compensates","Potentially interesting plot of a gambler meeting an attractive young lady with both of them having his and her problems is absolute garbage on screen; not to mention it being boring, predictable, and so very unmemorable. Almost nothing is worth seeing here except for the teaming of Gable and Turner."
4,Buen disco,"Uno de los discos que marcan los inicios de ""La Negra"". Para los que estabamos acostumbrados a los discos de Mercedes de los 80's en adelante, este disco nos presenta un ritmo, unos temas y unos instrumentos que no nos eran conocidos en esta cantante. Son los inicios de Mercedes Sosa, cuando comenzaba a transformarse en una voz que representaría no solo a su Argentina, sino a la raza latinoamericana, indígena y olvidada.Pero, aun asi, no se puede poner en duda la calidad de esta artista. La fortaleza de su voz y la energia que transmite, nos hace estremecer al escuchar su musica.Claro, un disco no representa la trayectoria artística de esta cantante, hay que tener una buena coleccion para admirar la evolucion que, desde mediados de los 60 y hasta el presente, ""La Negra"" ha tenido."
4,Different but swell.,"I love ""How to Make a Human Heart"" and ""learning to Accept Silence"". They are two overlooked albums in the harcore screamo whateveryouwannacallit genre. This album makes for a more mature sound, but I have to commend the band for not staying the same. Most bands who do not delevop like such, end up making dull sophmore releases that sound too much like everything else, this,is not groundbreaking, but it is a fresh and newer sound that I am glad of because the typical harcore sound is getting old and the market is so polluted.Usually when a band comes back with a release like this with a mature sound all the kids dont like it, but they are excellent musicians, and the album went in a new direction, which is harder to do than stick to the same and norm like most bands do."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I don't know what the deal with this band is, they're totally generic alt-rock emo, but they're on a basically metalcore label. There's a little bit of post-hardcore cred in their sound maybe, and the production makes them sound slightly heavier and darker than drive-thru bands, but the tunes are totally mediocre, and this stuff really does belong on Drive-Thru. The main strength of these songs is poppiness, and they totally fail at that, and if they're attempting to be experiemental, they fail at that even worse. I just don't get this band at all. How hard is it to write a semi-decent pop-rock song?. This is definitely worse than their last album, which suffered basically the exact same faults, except slightly less so."
5,Experience and Ease,"As a harpist, I was given this CD as a gift by my Uncle, who has worked with these musicians. These two harpists have a breathtaking array of experience separately and together, and they play together as if they were one. If you are not familiar with harp music, this CD is wonderful introduction, presenting a varied crosssection of harp music from early to modern, all performed with great precision and ease. My personal favorites are harpsichord music played on the harp, and the Rameau and other Bach pieces are favorites for me. Others will be thrilled and surprised by the power and unusual ""hammer"" and ""booming"" techniques in the modern pieces. Having a small and growing library of harp CDs, this is one I reach for over and over. Thank you for the gift, Uncle Bob!"
1,It tries to hard,"This is not a sweet movie, it wants to be or appear to be. It tries to hard to be that. Not recommended, it could carry a more mature rating."
3,This movie is borderline retarded,"And I enjoyed it. Air drumming is a way of life for Power (Ari Gold). He is obsessed with Neil Peart and cereal. After being fired from his mining job, Power BMX bikes 40 miles to an illegal Mexican air drumming competition. The Spanish Death Metal proves too much for him, as the police come in to bust up the racket. On a tip, he then hitchhikes to New Jersey to hook up with an air drumming krew. Power is relegated to floor tom. He is staying at a mission above a Chinese take-out restaurant, and falls in love with a deaf girl whose mother thinks Rock & Roll is the work of the devil. But rebellious Annie is charmed, and wants to see the music she can't hear."
1,Kant,"The book is full of typing mistakes. For example: Eousseau in stead of Rousseau, this makes reading very difficult!"
2,Misleading title,"This is a bad book. There is next to nothing about the battle for the Central Highlands (10 pages tops). The writing style is annoying; the author writes as if he is floating through (and slightly above) the events he relates. There is zero humanity. For instance, about halfway through the book, the author ""gets his family settled"" at a new duty station. The book started with him at 15 years of age. When and where he acquired a family is, and will remain, a mystery.The book is also in serious need of an editor. There are numerous examples of the same sentence groups appearing from 1 to 3 times as a given topic is explored again. It's like copy and paste was overused on the word processor.Finally, the oft repeated praise of Ed Sprauge goes far beyond admiration or even hero worship. It's absolutely cloying. Enough already.Save your money for a better purchase."
3,Just a small part of the big puzzle,"As a 60's veteran and student of SE Asian history, by no means do I intend to denigrate Mr. Dooley or his comrades in SF, but I get the sense from him that his time in the army was a bittersweet experience. The book says relatively little about the battle for the central highlands, and even less about his outfit's enemy engagements during that battle. Anyone who has spent time in any military service knows of the inability of staff officers to manage front line units, yet Dooley's entire book seems to be focused on just that. If you want to add to your Vietnam library get the book. If you're just buying it to learn about the battle for the central highlands in the 60's and 70's you will be disappointed. Vietnam was a huge black mark on our country's history, but there were many positive, individual military accomplishments in spite of LBJ and his perverted politics."
1,Battle for Central Highlands,"Poorly done book, very disappointing. This person seems to be so imbittered, some real psychological, perhaps relating to VN experience? Cannot seem to adjust to civilian jobs etc etc. I do not recommend at all."
2,Battle for the Central Highlands,"This book is probably a very accurate chronology of George Dooleys career. It also gives one an incite to the political stance taken on the Special Forces. It may be a very good book historically, but really tells little of the actual battle for the Central Highlands. This book does nothing to deminish my admiration and respect for all of those brave souls who fought and who died in a very thankless conflict."
1,Good packaging for a rip off product,"I have complaints about everything in this package. The extra software did not work and the whole package turns out to be a continual advertisement for Broderbund to buy more online products and subscriptions. Like the users above, I expected the box to contain the graphics advertised. It is just as well, since I found most unusable anyway. Junk. Cute junk but junk. Trite.This has angered me so much that I will never purchase any product from Broderbund again."
5,"Great Seller, Quality product, Promptly delivered!","The DVD arrived in excellent condition. It was well pack, and arrived in pristine condition. It played perfectly. i am 100% satisfied with the seller, and would happily buy from him again."
1,Great Product But Shipping must be a joke,"I'm just writing this review because there shipping charge for this product must be a joke. on there home website it's just six bucks to ship this clown prop. on amazon, they want thirty bucks just to ship it. there just trying to get some extra cash. I'm not saying that this clown prop is bad, not at all. in fact it's a great prop. just the shipping they want on amazon is outrageous. They need to quit cheating the public if they want to make a sale."
3,Does an Adequate Job,"This product is okay and does take care of the the clothes that I need to dry, however, I wish it was sturdier."
4,Really helps,It's very helpfull for small clothes that we shouldn't put in the dryer.I use for delicate cloths and bras.
5,Chili Pepper Lights - The Hottest!,I was very pleased with the Bethlehem Indoor/Outdoor Chili Pepper lights that I purchased. They add a festive flair to any event. They arrived quickly from the vendor.
4,Bethlehem Indoor/Outdoor Chili Pepper Light Set,"These lights are really cute and one string was long enough to go around my balcony. The lights are red unlike others I've seen, which are more orange. The only downside is that these pepper lights don't have the green top to add that extra ""pepper"" touch, and from far away they can look like christmas lights. But, they are obviously shaped like peppers, so up close you can tell. Also, these lights are great because they are made of rubber instead of glass, which makes them more durable than the average light. Overall, I would recommend this product."
5,Works great,"It's simple, but it works great. I wasn't sure which of the retrievers' mechanisms would work best, but this is simple and works well."
5,Best type of ball retriever out there,"The other types of ball retrievers are just crazy. They are too complex for what they need to be.This one is light- yet sturdy. I have retrieved balls fully extended and it sure is a long way out there, with good control.I have found a few PRO V1's with this and it is already starting to pay for itself!"
5,15' golf ball retriever,"Excellent! Arrived on time, exactly what I ordered. Look forward to ordering more products in the future for golfing needs."
5,Highly Recommended,"""God, Is That You?"" will rekindle the devine spark within you. Uncompromisingly fresh and profoundly spiritual, Katharine Giovanni presents a clear path to enlightened prayer."
1,Don't Every Waster your money,"I purchased Gigbit 3COM 3824...Extermely Bad on Gigabit...Many Errors with applications...Exchange Server, Remote Desktop, Loop In Network, Ultimately replaced it with LINKSYS...Much cheaper..but excellent performance,,,I am happy now"
1,Junk,stopped working within a few months of ownership. Would not take a charge or charge my items any longer. I do not recommend it.
5,Save money ! and time !,"If you usually use the oven or toasteroven and switch to a jetstream oven - you will see a lower electricbill ! I promise you. And a much tastier, and healtier way of eating. We have used this product for 9 years and this is our second one we have. I can really recommend it.AnnaWa."
5,"Excellent, but very fragile","This is an excellent product, unfortunately it is easily breakable. I have owned this product less than a year and I have already had to send it in three times. I don't know, but every so often I have been getting cracks throughout the machine when I use it , although the NESCO company has replaced the part everytime with no problem- I am still under the one year warranty."
3,Not sure about this,I am using this product to replace a microwave. I have used it once and it took twice as long as long as the directions book stated to cook boneless chicken breasts. I think that my oven would do as well.I need to be fair and state again that this is the first useage of the product.
5,"Perfect for Muffins, Snacks and Jello",These adorable brightly-colors heart-shape silicone molds are perfect for a variety of uses. I did not find that they dried out baked goods if the mold wasn't removed right away. You don't need to spray them and muffins pop out effortlessly. I leave the muffins in the mold to send in my children's lunches. They are the perfect size for bento lunches and hold snacks easily. They clean up nicely and I didn't experience the muffins sticking to the inside. I also use them to make and refrigerate jello and they fill line is an added bonus. I would probably stick with paper liners when baking for parties or events so that I don't lose my molds. I love these mold and recommend them.
3,Very cute silicone cups but...,"These are adorable looking, and they even have a handy fill line on the inside. I'm not sure, however, if I would purchase these again. I think silicone baking cups are great, but if you leave your cupcakes or muffins in them for too long after baking they will still stick, but if you take your baked goods out, they dry out quickly. Also, once you take them out it's not that obvious they are a heart shape. You might as well use round ones. Or stand alone foil baking cups...I think I'll use those next time. Also, they are dishwasher safe but I'm not sure where to put them in my dishwasher where they wouldn't just fall.I was so surprised that I didn't love these."
5,Perfect for Turkey Cupcakes,"These are a hit with my wife. We buy a lot silicone cooking stuff these days. It's durable and easy to use - and a healthy alternative compared to a lot of other choices out there. Anyway, she makes these fabulous turkey cupcakes with these and says they're the bomb. They certainly look and taste incredible. So there it is. Thumbs up and we recommend."
2,Not Plaidy's Best,"I have read a lot of Jean Plaidy's books and this one is definitely the least of my favorites. The story itself has too much repetition and the ending is too abrupt. Plus I was hoping for an epilogue, that explained properly the demise of Queen Katherine and the fate of her children and husband. I had to look up in another source to find all those facts. I will continue to read more of Plaidy's novels, but I'm hoping the rest are better than this one."
1,Not the greatest writer,This was written as if Katherine of Valois was just writing a diary. This could have been a great story but it came off very bland - with no details or descriptions.
2,"Off on Facts, Very Tedious Read","Jean Plaidy was a very good author although she did tend to make up her ""facts"" as she went along - which makes it very hard to read if you are at all familiar with the what's, who's, and such. This book is exceptionally tedious. I found it very disappointing."
2,The Queen's Secret,This not the usual well written tale by this author. It failed to hold my attention.
3,Packed full of fact,"This was an enjoyable read, and it is packed full of all the goings-on of the period. Not only does the reader learn of the life of Katherine of Valois, but also figures such as Joan of Arc.However, what is most fascinating is learning about how Katherine's relationship with Owen Tudor occured. It really is a very interesting story.I love reading Plaidy's books, especially those in her Queens of England series, as I love to learn about historical figures. Plaidy is a wonderful teacher. The only downside is that the books can read too much like a timeline, and not a carefully narrated story. But then again, when dealing with the story of a person's life, I do realize that it is much better to be accurate than fastastical.Recommended for those who like their historical fiction to be factually spot-on."
4,Hidden Classic,I remember this record from high school and recently rediscovered it. The song 'Hold On' was a radio hit in '79 and the rest of the record contains some really good songs as well. The songs play well with a lot of energy. A good buy from a time gone by that had so many great English pub rockers.
4,Best SG-1 guide by far!,"I have to say, one of the reasons that I bought this book was because I own 'X-Treme Possibilities' by Keith Topping, Paul Cornell & Martin Day and it is the best book I have EVER invested in so I figured this was bound to be well above average. I was not disappointed. Unlike most 'official' episode guides for a series, Keith & co's guides always contain HUGE amounts of plot detail, cast info, trivia and general comments from the actors and author/s alike. This guide is definitely the best and most informative for this series, however, i find that it lacks some of the sparkle that made 'X-Treme Possibilities' and 'Slayer' such a joy to read, perhaps because there doesn't seem to be quite the same level of detail.Despite this I believe that 'Beyond the Gate' is up there among the best for any genre."
2,"One for the Money, Two for the Dough, Three to Get Deadly","I read this because someone recommended Janet Evonovich's books as being good reads - pretty hilarious- etc. I had also seen a couple of her books on the best seller list. I could not get into them at all. They are very simple with character development that doesn't really occur. When I read I am usually able to picture a character in my mind - not so with these books.To me, the recommend was highly over rated. If you want to read something simple, fast and easy on an airplane to kill time - maybe - otherwise skip Evonovich."
5,A laugh a minute,"I love Stephanie Plum!! I bought this so I could re-read these books. They are full of off-beat, quirky characters, and I love it. Just the thing to read after a stressful day at the office."
5,I love the Stephanie Plum Series!!,The Stephanie Plum series is a riot to read - If you like to laugh you'll love these books!!
4,Three Plums In One:,"I had heard that Janet Evanovich's books are really good, so just had to buy this one. I am in the second book in thisthree books in one. There is suspense along with this humorstyle she has. Keeps your attention and ready on what will happen next. I would highly recommend this book for very easy reading."
4,Great Deal,"Got it used from the Amazon market place. Also 3 books in 1. Got for my wife. She read the 1st book and wanted book 2. With this she get the first 3. So she got the next two books with this. She was happy. If she's happy, I'm happy."
5,Great Series,The Plum series is total awesome! It gets you from the first one. I did not purchase this item but have read the entire series and would recommend to anyone who enjoys a quick and easy read.
4,The Only 3 Worth the Read,"I loved Stephanie Plum, and the first time through the series I couldn't get enough of the sets. However, as I reread the set a second time I realized that every story is summed up in the first 3 books. Stephanie will never develop beyond the third book (maybe four if you count a few characters that are worth reading), and there will never be a decision between Morelli and Ranger. It starts to get old reading about how she can't catch a skip--regardless of how obvious it is she is about to majorly f up the catch. That's why I think the first 3 (maybe 4, I can't remember when the stoner guy comes in) are worth the read.These are not meant for someone who is wanting to read an epic, they are fun and lighthearted and simple reads and if you like laid back stories from time to time this is worth it."
1,Please do not buy this book,"I found this author not to my taste. The background, her use of language, the plot she weaves, the main characters, are all lacking . I read more than one book, so that I can give her a fair chance. I struggled through the first book, and gave up through the middle of the second. It simply was not worth it, despite the many recommendations she got on the romance talk board , which only shows that one should buy one book and test an author. If you are still in 2 minds after reading this please only buy one book."
3,Individualistic Wittgenstein?,"I have to hand it to Luntley; this is well argued. The claim that Wittgenstein did not view the social nature of language as ""constitutive"" (his words) is highly implausible, but it is very instructive to see where Luntley went wrong in his interpretation. For one thing, the 'social aspect' of language is by no means simple, and the cavalier attitude of many imputing this to W. is implausible. So, while I don't think the thesis is correct, the text deserves a look, particularly for those who find it a matter of course that the social determines meaning in Wittgenstein's writing."
2,"Kind of slow in the beginning, but better in the middle","After the death of her husband, Laurel returns to her hometown. She didn't count on falling for Tripp Jordan, the town sheriff. Tripp is divorced, and he wonders if his faith in God can be restored. Both struggle to raise their teen-aged children as single parents. This book started off kind of slow, however, the pace did pick up around the middle. My favorite part was when Ashleigh, Tripp's daughter, accepts Christ into her life. Laurel helps Tripp to restore his faith in the Lord."
3,Professional weirdness,3 1/2Boldly bizarre band at peak live strength captures much of the positives ambitious psychedelia offered during the early seventies without ever resorting to stereotypical moves evoked by so many other groups.
2,Weak academically and otherwise,"Professor Johnson gives the total victim typology a full-out book-length workout. Every excuse for the women she cites comitting crimes is dredged out and covered weakly with academic gloss. Most women are in prison for violent, not non-violent crimes, which invalidates many of her arguments for them as primarily society's victims (as prostitutes, drug addicts etc.) A lower % of African-American women are in prison than African-American men, which she fails to cite, and also fails to butress her points. The whinier of the voices she quotes also grates after a while."
5,Swanson's have the best Vitamins and Herbs,I have dealt with Swanson's for many years now and they have always given me the very best vitamins and supplements available and Royal Jelly has over 40 minerals and amino acids in it.
5,Please with the product,"I am happy with the Royal Jelly tablets, they are easy to swallow and have indeed increased my energy level."
3,"Improve skin quality, but also increase my appetite.","If you are willing to gain additional pounds in exchange of better skin and hair quality, this is the product for you. Well, I know there are a plenty of born-to-be skinny women out there who want a baby-smooth skin. Royal Jelly can help maintain the elasticity of the skin."
5,me please,Thank you for your quick and prompt service the item was as said it arrived quicker than what was implied.
1,used it for a month then dumped it,It was first of all poorly constructed. The first one I got had a crack in the bottom and there was no way to wind up the cord and it leaked water. Amazon happily exchanged it. I used it for a month then calcium deposits started forming fast and started to clog the holes. I tried to clean it but it just got worse. It does put out a lot of steam but that's about all it can do. Controls are hard to use. It comes with extras though like a demineralizer and plastic gaurd for the hot plate. I ended up buying a model w/ retractable cord and have been happily ironing ever since.
1,Riddled with errors,"We have used Access guides for almost twenty years for many locations. They have always provided a strong alternative to the traditional guides, with a particular emphasis on architecture and design. We have returned our copy of this book. The maps for Florence are completely inaccurate with no co-relation between text and map numbers. Essentially the guide is of little use without a separate map. ."
1,DON'T rely on the map numbers!,"I agree totally with the reviewer who complains about the lack of relationship between map numbers and street addresses. This edition is completely messed up, and unaware tourists are going to be standing in Florence, book in hand, wondering where the #$@&! the museum/gelateria/hotel is that was on the map for that location. What a shame - Access guides are usually just the best street-by-street guides around. And this isn't a matter of just being one number off, consistently, or of the location being just around the corner. Numbers on the map send you all the way across town sometimes, compared to where the location really is. Extremely weird and unexplainable. Why isn't HarperCollins pulling this off the shelves and/or offering buyers a corrected edition? Someone really dropped the ball here."
1,Wrong number,"Sadly, I have to agree with the previous three reviewers...I have just emailed HarperCollins in Australia to see whether they have correct maps (the text looks ok) and will post the gist of their reply if it seems useful.I HOPE the problem is only with Florence... I am going to Venice as well as Florence and the text looks useful.It looks to me as though the text is correct and the maps are wrong - but I stand to be corrected :) by more knowledgeable readers.UPDATE: The maps are indeed wrong, but HC Australia supplied correct ones. I suggest if you bought this flawed edition you contact HC and see how they can help.HC's service in helping to find a reasonable solution (I go to Italy shortly) was excellent!"
3,Ford E450,I have been looking for a completely fitting sun shade for our Ford E450 2006. This window shade was offered to be made to fit my unit. It does not. There is iches around all the perimeters. I am not sure what I can do next. When the truck is parked I need a sun shade that covers the entire front glass.
4,Sultry and Satisfying,"Majandra's voice is beautiful and her songs are sultry. Those of us who remember her singing debut as a young TV actress on ""Roswell"" will be pleased by the style of it. She seems to be trying again for that smokey lounge singer feel, and I think she nails it. My favorite track would probably be #2, Oh, The Places You'll Go, and least favorite is #3. But all in all a great album."
4,Sweet like Candy,"I am addicted to this album. I've been a fan of Majandra's since Roswell, and I own her much-coveted debut album The Sicks--which I loved as well. Yes, Majandra's music can border of pretentiousness and the lyrics can seem dark for the sake of seeming dark, but Tarte was an absolute surprise. I bought it intending to find it a pleasant indie album, maybe another The Sicks in term of subject matter and tone, but instead, I got a succulent treat of an album. Majandra may compare herself to Fiona Apple, Bjork and the like, and the genre may be the obscure ""Dark Cabaret,"" but this is a trip-hoppy torch singer of an album. If Majandra decided to make a straight torch album, she would hit it out of the ballpark. Stand-outs include ""Syrup Like,"" ""Still Not Over This,"" ""Funeral for a Wednesday"" and ""Who We're Meant to Be."" If you're into indie artists and have an open mind concerning actresses-turned-singers, try Tarte."
4,Becoming Naomi Leon,"Children have every day problems too. They may limp down the hallway with a gleaming smile and never show it or eternalize it and believe they aren't worthy of a sleep over with friends. Becoming Naomi Leon is a fantastic insight into what may be going through a child's life as it is told by a child. This book may serve as a way for our young children to cope with their problems by knowing that there are children out there who overcome odds stacked up against them. Through grandma's faith, her brother's optimism and her long lost father's encouraging words, Naomi Leon is no longer limited through by her inhibitions. By the end of this chapter book, you will find yourself proud of Naomi Leon's courage to stand up against her troubled mother, and more importantly, her fear. Pam Ryan does a marvelous job of connecting cultures throughout this book, and gives us encouragement to become what we are capable of becoming--a brave Leon."
4,Review by Destiny T.,"4 stars! Becoming Naomi Leon was a wonderful book that deals with family and culture. I reccomend it for all ages. One thing I did not like about it was that the author should have made it longer, other than that it was wonderful."
4,up and down events,naomi goes through a though time but i respecther for that it was a good book for a book report!!!
5,Heartwarming...Couldn't put it down!!!,"Naomi Leon's full name is Naomi Soledad Leon Outlaw. This book chronicles a couple of months in Naomi's life in which her mother returns after abandoning the family, leaving Naomi and her brother Owen with their great-grandmother. Over the course of these two months, Naomi learns who she really is.Naomi's brother Owen has some physical impairments and it was interesting to see how they dealt with school children teasing Owen, as well as his own mother not wanting him. The point can really be made about how we each have something different about us, and it hurts our feelings when people make fun of us, etc. Naomi's mother is alcoholic, and Naomi learns what that means and also what effects it carries into the life of the alcoholic and his or her family. I really think this is something both boys and girls will want to read, especially if they have a little background in the Spanish language and the Mexican culture."
3,Overcoming Obstacles,This book is about Naomi Leon having to endure a lot as a young child living with her brother and grandma. She had tough obstacles to face but overcame them all and eventually was united with someone who truly loved her. This book teaches adolescence to never giver up even tough things may not be going as smooth as you would want them to.
4,Naomi Leon,"Becoming Naomi Leon is a story of two young children who were abandoned by their alcoholic mother at a young age and left to be raised by their positive thinking but equally tough great grandmother. Naomi, who narrates the story, shares the family's struggles when their mother comes to their trailer named Baby Beluga in Lemon Tree, California to break up this non-traditional but happy family. She not only shares the family's struggle to stay together but also shows the troubling time of adolensence struggling to grow from a child to a young woman. Throughout the novel we see Naomi transform from an awkwardly shy child to a young woman who speaks up and finds her own voice. Through this Naomi is able to relate to many other young readers going through the same tough time. Personally I can relate because I also grew up in an extended family and can also relate to the struggles of adolescence. Though this novel is simple and short it is a moving story to be enjoyed by many."
4,Productive New Perspective,"The benefit of Whedbee's book is that it offers a fresh, new perspective to the Old Testament. If you are conservative in your understanding of the Bible, you often miss some important information in your seriousness in dealing with the Scriptures. If you are more modern in your reading of the text, you might easily pass over much of the data as outdated remnants of a bygone culture. The comic reading of the Old Testament offers a correction to either extremes.While I cannot say that I agree with all his conclusions, I have found this a valuable read as I teach the text of Genesis -- and it has opened new doors to other places in the Scriptures."
2,Not as expected...,"Size of glass is good, however the glass pattern doesn't look very nice in person. It should have more of a sparkly effect. Looks kind of drab and I don't think I'll be using them when I set my table. Clear glass would look much better."
4,What a book,"I will be perfectly honest, Mister Monday is amazing. I have read many fantasy books in my life, but this one really wowed me. Garth Nix creates a vast array of imaginative creatures with incredible talents. Take the Fetchers for instance. They are man like creatures with a dog's face and teeth. I would not want to run into a fetcher in a dark alley. Nix also uses a fantasy theme that we have all seen in the movies: interdimensional travel. Though I enjoyed fantasy theme, I do think that Nix went slightly overboard. Even fantasy books have to be a little bit realistic. All and all, the book was great, and I recommend it to fantasy readers everywhere."
4,Good beginning...,"I liked the story, but it lacked the detail and depth that can be found in Tolkien and Rowling. A bit more story and it could reach their level easily. As it is, it will take the series as a whole to compete the depth if it goes on as is. A story should leave you wanting more, but this left me knowing I wasn't going to get any more from the first segment only the story as a whole would grow. It's a shame cause I think the author has created in this story a work that could have become a classic epic within the genre. Now, it's simply a good read that could have been great."
3,Could have been brilliant,"This book had some wonderfully absurd moments along with brief flashes of pure genius. The bibliophages at the end were brilliant along with the way they were defeated. Unfortunately the rest of the story just felt like a bunch events related one after another, not unlike the bible. The main character was only moderately likable with a barely intact sense of humor. The rest of the characters were a bit like paper dolls."
3,Why all the hype?,"I wish I could give a summary! This book, hyped to be the first in the ""next Harry Potter"" was so confusing that I can't figure out what was happening or why it was supposed to be important. Ok, that's a slight exaggeration. I managed to figure out what was happening, more or less. But this is definitely not the next Harry Potter. The main character, a young asthmatic with greatness thrust upon him is not fleshed out very well, nor do we see much growth in him from the beginning of the book until the end. His supposed motivation for jumping through all the hoops that Nix puts him through is to find a cure for the plague that's sweeping his hometown, but it really seems like he's just going through the motions because he has to. Perhaps his motivations become clearer in the next 6 books, or perhaps we see some growth in the character, but I'm not sure I care enough to go through 6 more books."
1,Waste of money,"This book started off very good, but as it progressed it was incredibly boring i was basically falling asleep to it. The story has no story line, it isn't planned out well, the characters aren't described well and its mostly a narator telling the story. I would not suggest this book to anyone it was terrible! I should be more careful when I pick up a book. I started it like 2 months ago and i haven't liked reading it, there are few events and it's as boring as heck, there's no good concept to it."
3,Keys for a sleez!!!,"This book was pretty good. I would suggest that you be under the age of 1726.Being the old hag of an elf that I am, 14 is pretty old you know,I wanted the pleasure of reading youngster material.So I did."
2,What in the world - not even that,"This is a totally Obscure novel - the beginning had me excited and totally involved - that is until this became Return of Alice in Wonderland - Fantasy does NOT mean create an entire world where nothing makes sense - this crux of this story delves into a completely unrealistic world - not a fantasy world of cool, I would like to see this, but wow, what the flak jacket just happened here? - i don't get the point, and i got sick of this by page 100, which is how far i will go with an unsuccessful story - some people love this, but I am not some people - I like more meat on the bones, and not a psychedelic mushroom induced fantasy novel - this may be for you, but not me ..."
3,Amazing childrensbook,"It got me hooked on the first pages, but toward the end it seemed to leave most of it's speciality behind. Don't get me wrong, the book had storyline like no other, it's characters ( or bad guys ) were discribed in a way you just couldn't miss em and ...Somehow I was just left wanting to hear more about Leaf and Ed ( two classmates, who could have been good friends to Arthur ). Why couldn't they have helped Arthur more? Maybe that happens in next, coming books."
5,"wonderful book, a must read indeed!","This was a great book, which really pulls the reader in! Nix has done a great job with the adventure aspect of the novel, and there are many fantastic (if fantastically evil) creatures, described in detail in their essence and physical aspects included. It is a true heaven to those who love fantasy adventure novels, the rough story is as follows:Arthur Penhaligon, an asmathic seventh grader is an intersting character, with a very unordinary life. One day, he is handed the Key and the Atlas, and the fate of his world falls on his shoulders, as a fatal plague sweeps the area. The fast and intense plot makes the book absolutely captivating, as Arthur finds out just how deep his adventure goes. It was a wonderful book, as was its sequel, Grim Tuesday. I have not read any further, but these two have persuaded me to pursue this series, and i hope it will motivate many others to as well."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I picked up Mister Monday with many preconceived notions. It seemed a little young for me, but since I like Garth Nix so much, I decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did, because this book turned out to be much more than I expected. It was full of action and twists and turns, very satisfying. I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't top my favorite Garth Nix book, ""Shade's Children."" I recommend this and ""Shade's Children"" to everyone who likes an action packed book."
5,A Thoughtful Childrens' Series,"Garth Nix has done it again, he has again come up with a new and creative plot in a magical world even more real than that of his Old Kingdom. The book follows the adventures of a young, asthmatic boy, who inherits a strange clockhand. It is not long after before things start going amuk, and strange forces threaten his world.The boy, Arthur Penhaligon, drawn into complete despair, ventures into a house only he can see, and into a world he where he should not be.This book is sort of a cross between Harry Potter and the Matrix, but with clear invention and an all together fun story. Hold on tight, and don't be left behind!"
3,Hmmm interesting...,"Mister Monday is a fantasy novel to the extreme, with many of the cliches that go along with the distinction. It often gets muddled with overwhelming imagery, perhaps to make up for a lack of plot from time to time. Although it is the literary equivalent of a cluttered desk, Mister Monday's images are rich, and will leave you wanting more. The characters do their job, i.e. you like the heroes and hate the villains, but I wish there were more to them. I was interested enough in the strange and original concept to read on to the next book, so I would venture to say that Mister Monday is definitely worth reading at least once."
4,praise for mister monday,The book 'Mister Monday' by Garth Nix was well written and entertaining. I thought it was a great series starter. Garth Nix used a lot of voice and style. I absolutely loved it!
4,A Good Book by a Good Author,"In an effort to do whatever he can to save his family, his friends, and his world, Arthur Penhaligon enters the strange House that only he can see. What he finds inside will change him forever. This is a suspenseful story packed with adventure."
4,Something for Everybody.,"This is a great album, I've been a fan since day one. ""You Want This Party Started"" is a great opening song and is in tradition something for the people mode. I'm feeling the songs ""On My Mind"" (reminds me of the old days), ""Take It Easy"" and ""There I Go"". This is really good to buy as an import because of the extra tracks. I can't wait for the new album --dont sleep!"
5,A great read,"This is a wonderful book. Walter Koenig has a gift for writing in such a way that you feel he's just standing nearby chatting with you. His observations of ""Star Trek"" and making movies in general are witty and insightful. Check out his other book, the autobiographical ""Warped Factors"" for deeper insights into his complex personality, and how his many acting efforts after ""Star Trek"" were overshadowed in many ways by the character of Chekov (and an even deeper view of his wonderful sense of humor.)Thank you, Walter!"
4,Star Trek - Always Positive,"Detailed peek behind the curtain of the making the first Star Trek movie. Having read several memoirs and biographies of various participants in the Star Trek world, it was nice to gain another perspective. This was a mix of technical as well as antidotal tales with fun surprises along the way. Told with humor, grace and humility.Beach Reader"
1,Terrible (Do not Buy),I've never seen such a bizarre production. It was sick! We could not watch it all the way through.
2,not what I expected,this movie is junk as far as Im concerned. Too much sex and stabbing. Stick with the made for TV movie and read the book by Vincent and you get the idea.
1,Not watchable don't waste your money,"This movie was terrible. I expected a documentary, instead it was poorly acted reinactments from bad actors. I watched for maybe 40 minutes and had to shut it off. It was just terrible. I am a huge documentary film watcher. This movie could have been good, but it's just flat out terrible. I rented it from the library, what a waste of my time. It's not the typical documentary you expect. The cover of the DVD makes you think it may be a serious look at that whole incident, its a joke and should never have been burned on a DVD."
4,very unsettling,"the manson family.. one of the great puzzles of our century.. It is in a way what this century is about.. techniques in how to control, mislead, and even hypnotize a flock or populous.. It is like a miniature example of what aldous huxley feared in 'brave new world' - methods of keeping people in place - drugs, illusion, persuasion..While this movie is not the perfect portrait of the manson's it kept my attention the whole way through - and aroused my interest in the case and its implications.. Filmed in a very original style.. it sometimes feels slightly amateurish.. but nevertheless succeeds where it is most important to succeed.. worth watching."
1,Disappointing to an extreme,"As a reader/watcher of all things Manson over the past 10 years or so, I was so looking forward to this film. Sorry I bothered!The actual murders are reproduced in incredible detail, but the rest of the film is trash! I wanted to give up after a short while and go and watch day time tv! Yes, that's how bad this mixed up load of old nonsense really is. The only bonus is the second dvd with its' lengthy excerpt from a real Manson interview.Avoid this like the plague if you want to know what really happened. If you just like grizzly horror, make sure you skip to the murder chapters. The rest is just a film makers ego trip!...and not a very good one either!"
4,TIPPY DUDE!,"IT WAS A COOL MOVIE IF YOU LIKE SEX DRUGS ROCK N ROLL AND MURDER,ITS PERFECT FOR YOU!SMOKE A FATTY FIRST AND LAY BACK AND GO FOR A RIDE."
4,Shoves the reality of what happened in your face.,"Yes, this film seems far over the top with it's graphic portrayal but, that's what makes it all the more upsetting.Watching it really makes it seem as if you are there witnessing what really happened.It takes the hollywood movie gloss off and makes it all too real. It made me once again feel for what these poor innocent people must have endured.May they Rest In Peace."
2,Works fine but dial text disappears quickly!,"Although the iron works well and is stylish, the lettering on the dial knob below the handle quickly wore off leaving me unable to figure out what setting it was on."
4,Great Intro to Visual Studio and .NET Programming...,"I am a web developer that wanted to learn how to get into the .NET game. This book was a great start. It quickly helped me learn how to use Visual Studio as well as how to start programming in VB. 70% of the book uses windows forms in the examples, 20% of the book uses web forms, and 10% uses console related examples. Overall, I really like the book and would recommend it to anyone that needed a starting point in .NET and Visual Studio. I only wish that the sections on web based (asp.net) forms were expanded. Unfortunately the asp.net counterpart to this book is written in C# by another author and is no where near as good as this book... bummer!"
2,Broken Promises,"Looked promising but the early code examples failed to run as predicted. The book assumes that they will and offers no help when they do not. Several code example failures, no response to emails requesting help, days of frustration and I was off looking for another book."
4,"comprehensive, userfriendly, just good","The 15th edition of Daniel Jones English Pronouncing Dictionary follows the tradition of its ancestors. It gives not only details on British and American English, but also includes international place names and internationally known proper names. It is userfriendly and easy accessible, although to use it properly, the reader has to be used to IPA (International Phonetic Association / Alphabet) symbols, otherwise the transcripts are not readable. Nonetheless, the book has to compete with Wells' Longman Pronuncation Dictionary, of which a second edition is to come up. Already the first edition of it is a concurrent of Daniel Jones, both books serve the same purposes and are equally good. Either the one or the other should be on the bookshelf of each English student."
4,a useful reference but it lacks depth,"As a nonnative speaker of English who teaches English as a second language I've found this book to be a source of valuable information. Its wide coverage and the inclusion of alternative or variant pronunciations are among its best features. However, it is not possible to approach it without a working knowledge of the IPA. The explanations given in the introduction are hardly enough to aid production of the sounds. Explanatory notes are few and far between. In this aspect, I believe J.C.Wells' Longman Pronunciation Dictionary is a much more complete and detailed guide (especially for nonnative speakers)."
2,NEW! Spoken North American pronunciations as well as British pronunciations for every word?,"Actually I already have the 16th edition of this title but after reading the description of this edition I thought I should by this edition because I found this sentence ""NEW! Spoken North American pronunciations as well as British pronunciations for every word""However after installing the software there are Spoken North American pronunciations and British pronunciations for the keywords only not for other forms (-s, -es, -ly, -ed, -ing) of these words"
4,All is well that ends well...,"The dictionary is definitely out-of-date. What's more, I had to contact its technical support team several times before I was able to use the dictionary - the thing is, it's an old edition, and the link to the Internet page where the user is supposed to learn the serial number of the dictionary is broken. All's well that ends well - they emailed me the number in the end, thanks a lot, but I wish I had spent my $400 on other books rather than on this CD-ROM with dated info. Rating update: 1 (one) star."
1,Dictionary,CD is only to check the how it pronounced. the software is not usefull to check your accents. i think it is just waste of money
1,The worst movie this year.,"There must be something in the water.I think all of the comments so far are from 40 year old and younger,I gotta tell you as an over 50,and been sci fi fan for life.This pile of steaming pony pucks,sucks on every level,from the actors to the acting,to the FX.Usually in a bad sci fi you will might find something to like.Good luck with this stinker.I found myself hopeing they would all get,(as granny would say)EATE."
5,"God help me, this was fun","Okay, it should be unwatchable. But director Mary Lambert kept things moving along, we got some great monster attacks and the catfight was hysterical. And the fact that all the party goers were armed had me laughing out loud.Okay, let's be clear. This is a dumb movie. But, it's more fun than most of the blockbusters you'll pay over $10 bucks for in the theaters this summer. Just stay home, invite over some friends, crack a few beers and enjoy this great slice of cheese."
3,"This movie is so bad, you will actually even enjoy it!","This movie is so bad, so trashy that some people like me actually want to see it!Special effects are below acceptable, acting mostly nonexistent, but nevertheless some fun to watch.Only for Trash lovers!"
3,"Doesn't live up to Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus's absurdity, but still entertaining","I hadn't planned on watching ""Mega Python vs. Gatoroid"" but when I realized it was written by the same screenwriter as ""Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus"", I had to see it. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to that movie's insane absurdity. This one is a more down to earth standard creature feature, but still pretty entertaining if you like that genre, as I do."
2,"OK, but not much more","This product has a lot clip art, but is hard to use. Although I have a 2.4 GHz PC, it still takes about 30 seconds for the application to open. When I import photos, PrintMaster seems to alter (diminish) the quality. For example, when I import high-quality photos into PrintMaster and then print them as part of a greeting card, the photos look very grainy. Borders are available as clip art, but are hard to re-size to fit around objects (there appears to be no specific tool for creating borders). Also, THE REBATE AD IS MISLEADING. YOU NEED TO OWN A COMPETING PRODUCT AND RETURN THE DISK BACK TO BRODERBUND TO GET YOUR REBATE."
1,Misleading rebate ad,This software is NOT FREE after rebate unless you own the previous version. I'll return mine.
1,Not as good as Hallmark / American Greetings,I've got both the Hallmark and Am Greetings software in addition to this. Both are much easier to use with better quality cards. Save your money and get one of those!
5,Great Progam-sure to love,"This progam is the best it gets. So many amazing features, that you can find whatever you're looking for. It includes a lot of clip art, pictures, different projects, and even crafts. It is also very easy to use! It is well worth the money."
5,Good Controllers,the controllers i got were black instead of the white ones that were pictured. but they still worked regardless of color. an excellent controler for the price.
2,Quality not good,"The left trigger on the controller will sometimes activate all by itself. By ""activate"" I mean it acts like I am squeezing it even though I am not. This makes it difficult to play many of my games. I took a risk on a cheaper product and I lost."
4,Good-but does have minor flaws,"I picked this controller up a few months ago as a second. Well, my original control is having connection issues, so I'm forced into using it. I would say on 90% of games, this controller would do fine. It has a bit of a cheaper feel to it, but that's not really an issue since it cost 1/3 of the price.The major issue I have with it is the L and R triggers. They work well but I play forza 4 almost exclusively and those triggers just don't have the sensitivity I need. Not easy to drive a high powered car with gas/brake either on or off :).The triggers either seem to be on or off and there is VERY little play between that. I'm slowly getting used to it but will be picking up a MS controller as soon as I can afford it.I can't complain about durability or any other feature, it all seems to be good. I believe I payed $15-$20 at Wal-Mart when I bought it, so the price is right. And once I pick up another controller this one is perfect for a second."
3,It's a cheap controller.,"The controller is cheaply made but hey, that's why I bought it. Overall it isn't bad for the price but the button layout is a little poorly thought of. The start and back buttons were moved from where they are on a normal controller to next to the guide button. They are not the most used buttons, but it is still poor placement."
3,gets the job done,"not the best, not the worst. u get wat u paid for, basically. gets the job done, though i rarley use it."
3,Pretty bad,"Compared to the stock xbox 360 pad, it has a good d-pad, but the controller sticks are atrocious. WHy? b/c they don't have the slighly rubberized grips that the standard 360 controllers do. Plus, the buttons feel very cheap, and on my unit at least the left bumper is a little defective b/c it's squishy. I saved $5 getting this instead of the standard controllre. Get the standard controller."
3,I'll break it down why this controller is decent 6/10,"+ Nice size & weight+ Good frame+ The controller buttons are responsive+ Triggers/Bumpers are responsive+ Analog is good- Home button works but lacks a spring- The D-Pad is mushy & doesnt have any type of spring.- The triggers aren't flat, they are built on an angle. So if your index fingers get to high on the triggers after use they will pinch them.In closing playing 2D fighters wont be happining with this controller. As most fighting games D-pads are the best command option. You dont get a good feel using the D-Pad. So analog games are your best options.Not a bad 3rd party controller but not all that good either. Its passable if you need a spare controller around & if you want to save a few bucks.6/10"
2,Quite tempermental,"This controller works great for some games, but absolutely horribly for others. Playing Puzzle Fighter HD, this controller is not noticeably different from the microsoft controller. Playing more sensitive games like Crackdown, Gears of War, and Forza 2, the left analog stick starts going crazy, getting stuck in one direction. I've had two of these controllers and treat my electronics very well, so I doubt it is my fault."
2,Good temporary control for guests,I ordered this control a while back ago because I needed a second control to play with my brother and so my nephews could play together when they visited. For the most part it did its job but after a while of use the control sticks started malfunctioning. Playing fps was no longer fun with this because the character would always be trying to up and that totally made it bad for my brother and nephews.I would recommend this control if you need something for company if its not getting a whole lot of regular use but if its going to be a primary control I would pass on it.
1,Works pretty well **UPDATE: Not any more,"I'm somewhat happy with this machine. The biggest problem I have with it is that it doesn't like to stitch a regular, straight stitch--it really likes a zig-zag stitch. Putting it on the straight stitch setting doesn't work, but if I put the dial in between two zig zag stitches, it will stitch straight. So, a pretty easy fix for a stupid problem that I shouldn't be having, but oh, well. It's an OK cheap machine.**UPDATE:I've had this machine for about 6 months now, and I can no longer get it to make a decent stitch. The tension is either way too high, or it creates loops on the bottom of the material. This machine has been driving me crazy with one problem or another for months and I'm replacing it now. Get something better."
2,Lots of hiccups,"I'm a novice sewer, so perhaps my experience is not typical of those who sew well and often, but I've had nothing but trouble with this machine. The birdnesting issues resurface everytime I rethread the machine, and while the machine works well for me in spurts, there is no consistency. I play with different needle sizes and with the upper thread tension, but with little luck. Even when the tension seems balanced, the machine will skip stitches randomly and occasionally reject a brand new needle (meaning that the needle will ram into some part of the bobbin case even if it doesn't look bent). I have been stranded in the middle of a project for months. In short, my experience learning to sew has been even more frustrating than I expected because of the difficulties with this machine."
5,Translation for the other review...,"The other review is great, so I just wanted to translate it into English: Excellent product of very good quality; has a lot of power, and sews all types of home/domestic fabrics!!! I recommend it for all home sewing jobs!!!EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD, CON MUCHA FUERZA, COSE TODO TIPO DE TELA DOMESTICA!!! LO RECOMIENDO PARA TRABAJOS DEL HOGAR EN GENERAL!!!"
1,Dreadful Layout!,Baum's classic story deserves better than this dreadful layout. (The boring cover is better than the text). How this could be priced at $22 (or even $16) is beyond me.
3,An acoustic explanation,"To explain the comments by others, realise that this was original issued by EMI Holland as a sales item for Al's tour of The Netherlands in 1996. The track listing is representative of the things Al was likely to include in his set lists at the time.One for the collector, really. Original editions contain a card listing the 'Concert Agenda '96.'"
2,Bait & Switch!,"Boy, for this pricetag was I disappointed!They sucker you in with the the title, but then you find out everything is a copy from other albums.It isn't an evening, and some tracks aren't even live, or even mostly accoustic! It looks like a ""Greatest Hits"" album based on who knows what. What on earth is the 2:09 studio track ""The Candidate"" doing on there, anyway?Sheesh."
5,Amazing from start to finish,"I saw Framing Hanley live last weekend. I fell in love with their music right away! I bought the CD right after the show. This is one of those CDs that you can listen to from beginning to end. I love every song. Their sound and style is perfect for working out, driving, or just chillin. They're a great band."
5,"Was God on the ""Hills of God""","This book is both entertaining, compelling and educational at the same time. Its a rare combination in literature today. If you take the time to read this book, you will never see the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the same light again. This story will transform you and leave you wondering why the world sat by and let this atrocity happen."
3,A little too understated,"Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. But it's just....missing depth.It's pretty much a diary. You would think there would be a bit more insight and detail on how he felt about the combat, but he kind of glosses over that part of it. And you have to admit, that's what you want to know: what was it like to be in his shoes? What did he feel?Just seems like, if he wrote anything deep in his diaries, he didn't let the author publish it. I can understand his letters home being light and avoiding anything scary...but not his journals.Still, a good read. There's still a lot there to keep your interest."
2,One too many,"This book is one too many in this very creative series. The mouse's ""next steps"" just do not follow each other or show the creativity of the first three books. Once again the illustrations are fabulous and save this book."
5,My daughter loves this book!,I would encourage anyone to purchase this book for a child. My daughter frequently requests it from the library. It is her favorite If you give... book.
3,A mom overseas,"My boys love mouse a cookie, pig a pancake, and moose a muffin so we were excited to order this newest book. However, I don't think that the storyline of this book flows as well as the others do. The transition from one antic to another seems to be a bit of a stretch. The mouse is still as engaging and energetic as ever. The illustrations by Felcia Bond are wonderful. My children still really enjoy this book but they haven't asked to have it read to them repeatedly like they do for the other books. When my husband finished reading it to them, he just looked at me and said that this was ""lame""."
3,If You take a Mouse to the Movies,This series of books did not impress me. It could just be me--an earlier generation. The book seems to go on and on about boring things. It made me feel as if it would never end.
4,Childrens Books,Very well done & written so that youngsters along with older children will enjoy the illistrations along with easily reading this book
5,If You Give a Child a Book,"Excellent book, one of my favorites from the ""If you Give a Mouse"" series! Do not miss this one!"
4,"If you buy a child this book, expect to read it often!","I first read my little sister ""If You Give a Pig a Pancake"" which we absolutely love. Although this book is not quite as memorable or charming, it is still a must for any bookcase. One of the not-to-be-underestimated benefits of this series of books is their brevity. This book is divine as a bed-time story. The only reason I did not give this book a five star rating is because I liked the originals (If you give a mouse a cookie, and the aforementioned If you give a pig a pancake) so much more, and I would recommend purchasing those books first."
2,Not as good as the others,"The illustrations are the same as her other three books (and are just as much fun) but the story line isn't as good. The steps that the mouse makes between each action don't really connect (or make sense). We LOVE the other 3 books, but this one was a real disappointment--we would not recommend it."
1,Not Helpful,"I was looking for good information on my 2000 RX300, but this has very little helpful information. Not like the Chilton Manuals I remember using 40 years ago."
1,Poorly written bogus spy story,"Robert Spirko's, THE PALESTINE CONSPIRACY is not worth reading. The book's plot is ill-conceived and its characters are not believable. The book's cover touts it as ""One of the best spy-thrillers of all time!"" IMO, it is one of the most amatuerish spy novels I have ever read. I bought this book based on an internet recommendation from a site I respect. However, I was seriously disappointed in its poorly conceived plot. The book is poorly written and is a waste of time and money."
3,go wow! for g.o.w.,"i recently purchased this album on vynal. not the 2nd version but, the 1st version. i thought it was fine just the way it was. i don't know why they had to add more songs."
4,Little Women,"I was glad this was the same animated feature because the artwork on the box is nothing like the cartoon (I did not like that). I was the right one nonetheless, only wish they had the rest of the Christmas story included when they open the gifts, but it did have several episodes made into one film so I guess they had to stop somewhere. If anyone knows where to get the rest of their films or if they come out on DVD, please let me know."
5,First book my dyslexic 11-year old son has read by himself,"My son and I have read the first 3 books in the Hank Zipzer series together. We enjoyed each one, especially the underlying theme of hope for children who learn differently. This fourth book, was the turning point where my son actually is reading the book alone. If I could contact Mr. Winkler I would like to thank him for being such a great role model for kids who are bright and creative but have difficulties in areas that the rest of us take for granted. The print is large and the vocabulary is not overwhelming yet the stories are fun and meaningful for the tween age group. We can't wait for the 5th book to come out in May 2004."
5,ZIPMAN IS A WINNER!!!!,The Hank Zipzer series written by Henry Winkley and Lin Oliver are wonderful! I ordered several books and my 9 y/o son is whipping right through them. My son also has a slight learning disability and relates well to these books.
4,Don't forget Beecham 1959 and Sargent 1946,"I would not presume why anyone might be listening to this music. For me and many others, claims of any literal truth to the Christian narrative have nothing to do with it. The power of the music, and its appeal to our sense of what is possible in our own lives is more than enough to inspire every feeling described by the previous reviewer.That said, this is an excellent performance, though many people consider Sargent's 1946 performance to be better. The Huddersfleld Choral Society was at its peak at that time, and the Dutton transfer is at least arguably better than the present one. Of course, you could obtain both versions, and others, including the masterful 1959 Beecham account (available on RCA), and enjoy this glorious music in your own way for yourself."
5,My betta loves them!,"I have been feeding my betta a different brand of bloodworms and she loved them. Call me crazy but after switching to this brand, I could tell that that she loves this even more! I feed this to her 3 times a week, alternating withHikari Betta Bio Gold -- 0.07 oz. I usually feed less than what is recommended just so I don't risk overfeeding them. I feed her 2 to 3 worms depending on how long they are."
4,Good product =3,This is a good product for your little bettas or goldfish or whatever other carnivorous fishies you might have without all of the mess of live food. The only downside is that for some reason 1 in every 50 people can have an allergic reaction to freeze-dried blood worms. So don't rub your face after handling and wash your hands!
5,My fish love these,My silver dollars love these blood worms. I love the no-mess cap that allows you to adjust the amount coming out. One of the better brands of fish food.
2,Description,"A warm-hearted tale of Omar, the ugly duckling, whose Christmas wish is simply to find a place where he belongs. Hitching a ride to the big city he meets up with a runaway girl and the two discover the true meaning of Christmas."
2,Not very good,"I have had this product for 3 or 4 days and the software has to be reinstalled every day to use it. And it seems to be harder to reinstall it each day. The signal is a little stronger than my 2 year old Hawkings, but not that much for the price. On their website I have failed to find a ""help"" section. Overall. I do not like this WiFi antenna."
5,Early Intervention,"It seems that the so-called reviewers in this space are not real reviewers but people who want to condemn the man who's already condemned for his violent past. He has paid the price. He's dead. Tookie sought redemption and part of that was to keep others from entering the life of gangs. This book and others he wrote talk to kids before they enter gang life. They are heartfelt and come from the mind and heart of one who lived it, who knew it as the rest of us never could.Tookie finally got over his own anger. He knew what he did, and he tried to do things to help others. The books are part of that."
1,gang members and books ?,"How do you get a gang member or potential gang member to read a book?? If troubled youth don't really care for books, how was Tookie really reaching them?My mom has worked in south central libraries for 25 years. We saw gangmembers doing many things, but I cannot say that reading was one of them. In fact as I recall from school days many had reading difficulties, poor vocabulary, and inability to concentrate......On top of that, Tookie himself said if someone had approached him with books like these, as a young person, he probably would have rejected them..........are books the right medium?"
1,Chidren learn what they are taught,"I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of ""children's books"".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."
5,I love this necklace!,"I get more compliments on this necklace than any other I own. It is very unique and goes with dressy and casual clothes. The only problem is that because it is such a good price, it doesn't last very long. I've had mine for about a year or so, and one of the beads is wearing the finish off. But even with that flaw, I still love this necklace! It's totally worth every penny."
4,Love it,Wonderful necklace. I like length of the necklace and where it falls. The clasp was broke when I got it but I can still use it the way it is. But I really do love the style of it.
2,Necklace,Didn't realize how large the pendant was - I thought it was going to be a cute little choker. It would have helped to have had the dimensions listed.
3,Huskeropoly is a fun game,Huskeropoly is fun if you are going to college or are an adult. It was too hard for the younger kids to play like in Monopoly.
2,Bad book,"I got a book, Java for Dummies, and then thought i needed a book on Java PROGRAMMING. I was right, but this was the WRONG book. It put me to sleep, didn't cover anything that well, and in the 2nd chapter, it showed a 12 page Java code! it said ""you won't be doing this, but this is REAL java code"" i just really thought the stupid book wasn't worth the money i invested"
3,Don't use on stovetop.,"Good for use in oven. Head their warning, Do not use big items on stovetop. Too much heat differential between bottom and top edge. Causes enamel to flake off. Toss it out after that."
1,Did nothing for my sons type one diabetes,I bought several different ones ...no real way to know if they work....Health Journeys: A Meditation To Help You Control Diabetes....My son could not see any real difference ....donated to the public library!~
4,"Great ending, but too short","I liked the book, in general. It was romantic and emotional, but it was just too short for my taste. I know it was stadard length for a Harlequin novel. I just think there could've been more depth here in the relationship(s) department. Other than that, the H and h had plenty of chemistry and the storyline was very good. I got annoyed at the H's brothers from the previous books and their attitude toward the h. It disappointed me how obtuse they were when it came to this woman's feelings toward ""her baby"" and how they assumed that thier ""always responsible"" brother would overlook the care of his niece for a bang-and-go relationship (which theirs was not). I would hope that most people understand that it takes more than blood relation to make a suitable, loving parent. However, they did redeem themselves in the end. I'll miss reading about these brothers... good stories!"
5,When The Earth Moves,"I'm no good at writing detailed reviews, but I can tell you this one is definitely another keeper. You can't go wrong with a Roxanne St. Claire book!"
3,decent book.,"while it is interesting to read the story behind election 2000, the book is not well written. the storyline is obviously quite interesting, but at times the book fills you up with worthless information, and gets boring & repetative. overall a good read though."
4,The almost complete story,"This is a great review of the various events that led up to the US Supreme Court's coup d'etat whereby ultimately one justice, and not the brightest one, decided that Bush and not Gore would be president. Kaplan provided a wealth of information on th roles played by honest and dishonest people in the bungled Florida election. My only criticism of this otherwise very well researched and responsible work is that it omits some important background information. For instance, it does not explain how the Florida governor and secretary of state accomplished that many african-american voters, mostly democrats, could not vote by manipulating the work of the data processing outfit that was to determine which voters were felons. This and other schemes would have provided a better understanding of the background of the election debacle, which was not an accident at all."
5,We appriciate ur war work .,Mr. President of USA .Sir we appriciate ur war work against afghanistan . we r muslims but the talibans r against of ur state & pakistan pls help the shumali itihad to kil all the talibans sir we r against the talibans & afghans because on every war they closed the borders on us & afghans always created the problems in our country because they r snake in the grass .they r also against the usa but why they took the funds from usa . this is the biggest selfishnes of talibans & afghans the many refugies came in pakistan now a days but as u pakistan's the finantial state of pakistan is not very well .we r waiting 4 ur reply pls reply us .GHYAS LATIF & NOMAN IDREESQUETTA PAKISTAN .
1,Destined for the Bargain Bin,"Shoddily researched, pregnant with speculation, this book is destined for the shameful dust heap of advocacy journalism."
2,Sour Grapes,"The book is easy to read. But it really is just an long winded argument that has already been beaten to death. It assumes that the people of the United States are stupid, ill informed and can form no opinions on their own. Because someone doesn't vote Libral, doesn't mean that are morons. The book is just plain sour grapes. In view of recent events, it is rediculous."
1,Boring with an Uneven Hand,"This story has been told in a number of books so there is nothing new here that millions have not seen on TV or read in newspapers. What I find so utterly tasteless is the title of the book. A)It is not true and B) given recent events isn't it time to rally behind our president instead of shedding doubt on him? This book is more an accident than our president, because it hits and runs with criticism toward Bush, but has hardly a hash word for Gore. This book does get my vote!"
1,"The Truth About The ""Accidental"" President","This book is nothing but typical mean spirited, unamerican, liberal spin. The truth is that all but two of the Supreme Court justices found serious Constitutional problems with the selective Florida recounts. The Supreme Court selected no one President, they only put an end to the Gore campaign's attempt to steal the 2000 election. (...)"
1,don't bother upgrading,I bought a new computer with windows XP and decided if i was going to be running the newest Windows I should run the newest Printmaster. I upgraded from Platinum 11 and I'm sending back Platinum 15 and re-installing 11. More than half the images are online now. You get three art discs and have to sort through online garbage to get the rest. It's to get you to sign up for their Million image club for another $$. They took away some features and added nothing. Quality went down. Wait for them to bring it back up before upgrading.
5,Just as expected.,No problems. Some of the pieces are very small so make sure to keep them away from little kids and pets.
1,OS Issue,"The game looks great, but unfortunately it cannot be played in Classic mode of OS X and it would have been nice to know that before I purchased the game. So now I cannot play the game."
1,Waste of Money,Do not order this unless you have Mac OS9. If you have any system that starts with OS X you will not be able to use this. The weasels who sell this do not tell you in the description that is is good for old macs only. They just take your money and then you will be unable to use the disc.
2,"Confusing, but I think I got it.&ss","I watched this film with my beau and we spent the first hour yelling, ""What an idiotic idea! Don't do it!"". Watching this couple entertain the idea that sleeping with other people would somehow enhance their marriage was depressing, nauseating and downright cringeworthy. However, if the viewer pays close attention, I believe that the cheating scenes as well as the aftermath are meant to repesent what MAY have happened if they'd gone ahead with this ridiculous plan. The last scene shows the couple in bed, still toying with the idea. I certainly didn't think this was a great movie,but I think the film maker's message was that thls is a bad idea! I was surprised that none of the other reviewers realized that the actual carrying out of the idea was hypothetical."
1,Maybe a bit of a spoiler....,"I'm not even sure where to begin.Basically, Anne and Darren have been married for seven years. Their marriage is perfect with one exception. They don't have sex anymore. They come up with the scheme that they'll both get one freebie to bring the spark back into their marriage. It seems like the perfect idea until it's over.I absolutely hated this movie. The ending left me with more questions than I started with. Sort of. I think I have it figured out but I can't be sure. The one thing that really irritated me was that there didn't seem to be any ending whatsoever. I need closure. I don't want questions.The movie seemed pointless. You know it's a bad idea. I know it's a bad idea. How could this loving couple of seven years not figure that out?"
5,Great product!,"This pandeiro was exactly what I was looking for to buy for my friend. Although I myself am not into capoeira as much as she is, I could tell a good pandeiro when I see/hear one. Great product for the price!"
5,"A must-read for planners, economists, and future-thinkers of all types.","City Planners, Urban Economists, Futurists, and others whoponder the evolution of cities must read this engaging study ofChicago's development. William Cronon's exceptionally well-researched and presented story is an arresting account of Chicago's evolution from a rough frontier trading post to a world-class metropolis. As the connecting point between the industrial/financial East and the agricultural/resource-based West, Chicago capitalized on its physical location as a transportation nexus, and prospered. Cronon's portrayal of the large and small influences that led to Chicago's success is intriguing to those of us who search for similar clues in contemporary situtions, and who wonder which of our current outposts will be the Chicago of the 21st century!"
4,"a blend of geographic, business and urban history","I bought this book during a business trip to Chicago. Late on a clear summers day I started reading as we flew west high above Cronon's America. I was still reading at L.A. and I finished it somewhere over the South Pacific as we were close to home. Its really economic geography/history with maps. Some of the analysis is dated and suggests an historian playing in an unfamiliar field e.g. Cronon spends some time developing the von Thunen rings theory of urban growth. This was considered to be a deterministic and flawed theory by my grad. geography teachers 20yrs ago . But, a book I enjoyed and reopened for me an interest in landscape transformation and urban history. You should also try Fernand Braudel's books the ""commerce and civilisation"" series of 3 - wonderful readable stuff on a bigger geographic scale but in a similar vein."

5,Lipstick Plant,I received this plant in a couple of days after I ordered it. I cannot believe how beautiful it is and how much it's growing. I will definitely order another through these people.
5,Just Perfect,Just as described and wonderful. Much cheaper then anywhere else I looked. Great item and will buy here again!
5,Excelent!,"I love this book. I bought it for my graduation coming up so that everyone can write in the cover of it to give me words of advice before I head out into the world. This book is a great book for anyone who is graduating, getting a new job, or just venturing out. I recomend it 100% and I recomend Amazon to buy it from."
5,Dr. Seuss-Oh the Places You'll Go!,"A perfect graduation gift...not expensive but meaningful and fun. This deluxe, boxed, edition is beautifully done and makes an outstanding gift on its own or with a gift card/$ insert."
5,A great growing-up and moving-on book,"When my children graduated from high school, I bought each of them this book and had the guests at their party sign it for them. The book itself is a wonderful ode to both the scariness and exhilaration of growing up and being in charge of your own life. The guests loved it and spent a lot of time making it a keepsake for my children by picking out pictures or phrases that they loved and then writing a few words of encouragement or congratulations. A marvelously inspirational book and a great gift for children of all ages. Enjoy!"
5,Great milestone book,"I'm a HS teacher, and I use this book as a yearbook ,actually have them dated back nine years, and they're much cheaper than a yearbook for me. The messages in story are fitting for milestones from kindergarten to college. I have a friend who bought one for her son, and she's going to have each grade teacher sign her sons book over years and give to him as gift at graduation from high school. I have yet to find a replacement, just so fitting for life transitions of any age."
5,Good Book,I am looking forward to getting all of my daughter's teachers to write in her book as she grows. She has Down's Syndrome and I think it will be a good reminder of how far she has come over the years.
5,A Wacky Book,"Oh the Places You'll GoBy Dr. SeussIf you are looking for a book that is a little strange this is the book for you.This is a book about a guy that goes to different places and sees other people. It's also about the places you will explore as you get older.It is a pretty easy book to read, it is not a chapter book. It is filled with pictures of colorful, weird, creative Dr. Seuss places.I would recommend this book to people who like easy and short books that are outside of the box."
5,Might be for kids... should be read by all.,"Love it - a very grown-up book of lessons wrapped up for the kiddos. A fun, colorful, and very Seussian tale of striving, failing, learning from your mistakes, moving on, doing well, not being appreciated, strengthening yourself, moving on, and oh the places you'll go! It's akin to child-self-help motivational goodness. It may be a bit out of place for this review, but I think this is a teaser to Ericksonian storytelling. Beautiful."
5,My daughter-in-law loves it!,She says the baby moves to her and her husband reading the book and that it makes for a special time for them! I loved how closely it follows the original book.
3,Slight Crease,"There was a slight crease in the pages....like the book had gotten wet or something. I found that pretty disappointing.,"
5,Good Book,"I remember this book from when I was a child and still love Dr. Suess! I saw the idea on Pinterest to have your child's teacher sign somewhere in this book each year and then to give the book to your child when they graduate high school with all of the signatures, so I came to Amazon and ordered it. I'm excited to do this and love the book!"
2,"Strained - not classic, but alright","Like his posthumous 'Daisy', 'Places' lacks the zing, the excitement, the otherworldliness of his classics.The strength in 'Places' is the message, which is OK - fairly new and simple, but eventually boring - not ennobling, like 'Lorax'.The drawings are weak, comparatively empty and labored. Compare to 'Sleep Book', which is a completely engrossing new world at every turn."
2,Not bad if you don't look at it as a children's book...,"Like dog owners that buy food for dogs that is more appealing from a human perspective, many of these reviewers liked this because it touches them from an adult perspective. Not only is this not that great for children, it's not even the good Dr.'s best work. If you don't believe me, buy it for you kid and see how they like it compared to other books. Not very engaging for kids...Try one fish, two fish instead."
2,over done,"Don't get me wrong- Dr. Suess is king of children's books. But I have had this book read to me so many times: at the end of 3rd grade, 4th grade, summer camp, sixth grade, etc, that I am completely sick of it.If you are planning on reading this to someone in a crossroads situation, don't. It's kind of like a good Top 40s song. You love it at first, but when it is repeated and repeated, you start to resent it. Don't do this to someone you care about!"
1,Waste of money for graduation gift,"Having received 3 copies of this book on high school graduation and 2 more following college, I implore others to refrain from purchasing this book. A student headed to college or their first job would get so much more from either (1) useful items for their dorm room or apartment or (2) books geared towards personal finance, leadership or other professional/executive training - years later, topics I wish I knew more about when I was young."
4,Great book!,"This was recommended by my girlfriend. Great book for all ages, and would be a great gift for high school or even college graduations."
4,oh the places youl go,happy with everything but very unhappy with length of time to receive product rate service at 2 stars because of slow service every thing else very satisfied.
5,I loved the this wonderful book!,"This book was used in our graduation (from high school) speech! This was so relevent to our life that it was amazing. Dr. Seuss books were fun because of the rhymes when we were all younger but now we see how the ""real world"" relates to these hilarious little kids stories. I always loved to read ""The Cat In The Hat"" when I was young. Now ""Oh, The Places You'll Go"" has become my all time favorite. I would suggest buying it as a gift for anyone, including yourself. I know that my children are going to have so many books by Dr. Seuss that it will be scary but I want them to know how great his books are."
4,Teaching to Believe in their Dreams! Growing Up with Loukoumi is a gem too!,What a perfect graduation gift as it teaches kids to believe in their dreams. Another gem is Growing up with Loukoumi by Nick Katsoris which teaches kids that if they work hard and believe in themselves then their dreams will come true. Both are excellent gifts this time of year and all year round. Perfect messages!
5,For children 1 to 100,"Inspirational yet honest, and always rhythmically rollicking, 'Oh, the Places You'll Go!' is a perfect sendoff for children ages 1 to 100. It's a great book for people entering any new phase of life. Kindergartners, graduate students, newlyweds, new employees - all will glean pearls of wisdom about their expansive future. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
5,"Oh, the Places You'll Go!","Oh, the places you'll go is a great book for kids of all ages. Dr. Seuss has done it again with this great book of rhymes and tongue twisters to keep you reading all day."
1,Party Edition switch,"If you buy this book from Amazon you will not receive the book shown on the page. Instead, you will be sent the party edition, which looks cheesy at best. If this purchase is for a grad gift, I highly recommend you buy direct from your local bookstore and not Amazon. I was sorely disappointed."
5,"Oh, the Places You'll Go",This is the perfect graduation gift! And the price is perfect too! Thanks!!! It goes great with the Dr. Suess pj's I found at WalMart!
5,Love this book,"We bought this for our daughter and we are having all of her teachers write her a note in it, with hopes of giving it to her at her graduation some day."
4,More for older kids than toddlers,Had bought this for a toddler but I read it first to determine if he might like it but decided this is more for older kids than toddlers.
5,Grad Gift,Great graduation gift. Will have teachers sign in it between now and my kids graduations! (idea stolen from pinterest!) :-)
5,Tears every time,"I gave this book to a person I will always deeply love because it expressed how I felt then and how I wanted the person to know I would always feel.The book gives the reader hope in a way that very few books can.Only Dr. Seuss can take such ""childish"" language and touch the hearts and souls of both adults and children. A true classic and one of a kind."
5,So creative,"We love all our Dr. Seuss books. This one is so creative and fun. The wording is clever and cute, and the creativity is fantastic!"
5,Two Year Old LOVES it...,"This is a great book. I read this book to my daughter every night before bed and she loves to help ""read"" it. It is a motivational story, and honest about the realities of life. This book is part of how I am trying to shape my daughter into a young person who can handle life and the hardships she encounters along the way. It is a great read and inspirational for all ages."
5,Book Club Selection,"We selected this book for a business book club at our company. The groups that participated found the book to be very relevant to their work and lives as adults, and enjoyed a fast, yet pertinent, read for our sessions. Some people indicated they have decided to give the book as a gift to a family member or as a graduation gift."
5,oh the places you'll go! deluxe edition,"This classic seuss is a must have for every book shelf. Great gift for the grad or person moving on. In particular, this copy was in mint condition and a very good aquisition at a fraction of the cost of a brand new one. Thumbs up for Dr. Seuss and those who sell at Amazon.com"
4,gift,"I bought this book as a gift for my best friend Rachel. She struggled in life but has finally managed to conqure all she has been through and is graduating, so this is one of her gifts from me. I also have a little poem i wrote to add to the inside cover."
5,good for all,this book was recommended to me by a good friend because im going through some difficult times. Even though its written for children i believe there is a very good message for eveyr age within the pages of this book. I go back to it often to help me through. Wonderful book!
5,Great for a school years memory...,I bought this book after my son made a wonderful suggestion for his pre-school daughter. He plans to give it to each of her teachers at the end of each school year and ask them to write something for his daughter. When she graduates from high school he will make it a graduation gift. It will be wonderful to read what her teachers have said about her throughout her years in education.
5,lovely book,I bought this to give to my son one day when he graduates high school. The book came in perfect condition. It's a hard cover book with a book slip and I love the message!
3,Average,"The book was supposed to be ""good"", but it was average. The cover I'd completely bent and wore out. The inside cover is faded and has little color. Not worth the money ."
2,I try to like it,"Maybe I am just crazy, but I feel like I have to like Dr. Seuss. Unfortunately, I don't find the stories to be very good, and the use of words makes reading out load more of a chore than a pleasure. If you like Dr. Seuss, ignore my review."
5,"Excellent, Motivational for all ages","This makes a great book. I gave one to a friend who's daughter is going to Kindergarten, I bought one for my little one and sent one to my brother who needed a little pick me up to get back on the right track. Its very motivational and I recommend it to every one of all ages."
5,Graduation Gifts,"I ordered ""Oh The Places You'll Go!"" for several graduation gifts. I loved the idea and I wrote a special message inside each one."
4,A classic for your growing child,"We bought this based on a P!nterest idea that has your child's teachers (from his or her first grade level) up until high school or college) sign it like a yearbook. So someday when your child is 18 or 22 they can open it and see personal notes from teachers that elicit the fond memories of toddler-hood and elementary years. If you're going to get this for your graduating child someday, get it when they're little and have their teachers sign a note as they end their school year. Just find a good hiding place for it for 18-22 years."
4,A great book for building self-esteem!,"I absolutely love this book. It is about making your way through the world. This book deals with all of the situations that one goes through as he/she travels through life. It speaks of the many twists and turns, which idealizes the events and problems one encounters. However, it gives notice to the personal power that one has to overcome these obstacles in life. I find it very encouraging. It is a great book to give a senior, who is graduating from high school. I feel that this is a great book for people of all ages. It gives hope and peace to anyone, especially those who need some extra inspiration."
5,"Oh, The Places You'll Go!!","This is a great gift for ANY graduate. I give this book along with another gift to grade school, high school, even college grads. I do not particularly care for Dr. Seuss, but I liked this book so much, I even bought one for myself! It's very uplifting. Enjoy!"
5,Super gift for any age,This is a wonderful gift. I have given it to high school and college graduates. It always receives a warm welcome. It has great wishes for the future and reminds us of the warms times in our childhood. It serves (I think) as a guide to keep us on a good path.
4,"Great Set, but...","This is really a cute set of animals. The sounds they emit are really big for such small little things. The tiger's roar freaks out my son a little bit (11 months old), but I'm working of trying to make it ""funny"" instead of scary, so I'm sure he will eventually get over it...I was really disappointed when the set arrived and the names of the animal were not on the animals as stated in the description. I will reach out to the company when I have the time to see if we can do an exchange bc the names were one of the reasons I purchased the toy in the first place...Overall, I like this very much and would recommend..."
4,So cute!,These little animals are so cute. The tiger and the elephant both sound a little scary but the giraffe and hippo are pretty tame. My daughter (7 months) loves all of them and she always smiles when you squueze them to make noise.
4,Different than a picture,"I got Aurora Barnyard friends for my son when he was 10 months old. He absolutely LOVES it! It's very durable, the sounds are real and the words on every toy are educational. I just got this safari set for my son's first birthday and it's a little disappointing. There are NO words on toys and the sounds are really weird except the elephant and the tiger. In general, it's a good toy, bright colors, durable, perfect for little hands. But if you choose between Barnyard and Safari, I'd say Barnyard for sure!"
5,My Photo Safari,"I saw this toy in a store at the Atlanta Airport for a ridiculously high price. Found it at Amazon for a more reasonable price. I bought this for my 11 month old grandson. It was actually suppose to be a gift for his first birthday, but I couldn't wait to give it to him. He loved it. The stuffed animals are just the right size for his little hands. His mom loved that they all fit inside the jeep when playtime is over. Some of the animal sounds are unusual and it is quite a sound when you get them all going at once. I would definitely recommend this toy."
3,Early Burnout,"Ok, I can get over the fact that it sounds like rotary saw cutting oak flooring, but I have to say I was expecting it to be more powerful and it did die within a month of purchase. 6 eggs worth of pasta dough will just barely mix and often caused it to cut out once the dough started to form. It finaly pooped out compleatly and started to smoke making a 10 cup batch of white bread with a few eggs in it. 6 minutes of mixing and now it is dead.Much to Kitchenaid's credit the service line was great. I talked to a real person fairly quickly who after just a few questions is sending me a Kitchenaid Professional as a replacement. I hope this one has the guts I need."
3,"Nice machine, but I got two defective ones in a row!","I bought a 4 1/2 quart KitchenAid mixer last year, used it a few times then it started squealing and dropping metal shards into my dough. Got rid of it and bought the 6 quart, used it one week to make Christmas cookies then the On/Off/Speed Selector switch jammed! Got rid of it, too....I'm going to try again on a third one!"
2,Not your Mother's Kitchenaid,"This one burned out attempting to knead 6 cups of flour. Prior to that it worked fine on cakes, egg whites, whipped cream and other easy tasks, but so would a $20.00 portable hand mixer. I suspect that if you are serious about making breads, Bosch and Electrolux are the way to go."
3,don't make bread with this!,"I have had my Epicurean mixer for 7 years. It has been great for cookies. It has worked well for 1 or 2 loaf bread recipes-- any more than that, the motor does not handle well. I thought that with a 6qt bowl and 475 W power, it would be able to handle large amounts... not so! After making a batch of dough with 10 cups of flour, it stopped working all together. Turns out the gear was stripped--talked to a few friends who had the same problem.It was never great at beating egg-whites (the attachment never reaches the bottom of the bowl."
2,Great. until it stops working,"I bought this and loved it! It's beautiful and powerful. This Thanksgiving, I attempted to make mashed potatoes and the lever/motor is not working properly. The machine turns on (at a medium speed only) and quits after 10 seconds. It will turn back on, but only at medium speed (no matter where the lever is) and will turn itself off after 10 seconds. It's just disappointing. No wonder they discontinued this model. I'm going to try to fix this-my dad is handy. I still love the looks & when it's working properly I love how powerful it is. I'm disappointed with this product as I only used it maybe 45 times, I guess I didn't get my money's worth on this product."
4,In Plain Sight,This is the first book I have read by C. J. Box and it won't be the last. In plain sight caught my eye at a book store and glad that it did. C. J. Box is now one of my favorite authors. The story is one that you have to find out the end. There is an interesting cast of characters in this story. Looking forward to reading his other books to see what happens with Joe Pickett.
4,Another winner in the Picket series!,"I try to write a review without any chance of a spoiler, so all I'll say is that this latest in the Joe Pickett series continues along the same vein as the earlier books in the series, although slightly darker. C.J. Box's writing style continues to get better with each new novel so if you like the other Pickett novels you'll like this one too."
3,Too predictable,"I love the Joe Picket mysteries, but I found this one to be lacking the suspense of some of CJ Box's other books."
2,Move along little doggie,"CJ Box must be tired. I sure am.Box and Joe Pickett are done played out. Plot line: Joe Pickett gets involved in someone else's investigation. His family is threatened. His job is threatened. Joe doubts himself, because he's pretty sure, among other things, that his wife doubts him. Joe wrecks his truck. Joe's family is saved with the help of Nate Romanowski, Joe's wild friend who may -- or may not have -- gotten wild with Joe's wife.CJ Box' Joe Pickett has gone from refreshing, self-doubting (and self-aware) lawman to self-parody. Box seems tired of it all, recycling themes from earlier books without the taut suspense that made the others interesting. He even recycles villains and incidents.All in all, a forgettable effort. The only bright spot: I borrowed it from the library."
1,The first few chapter stopped me,"Brothers fighting with shovels over their missing mother, a protagonists who takes pages changing his shirt, a mind-numbing prison visit featuring a con who craves chewing tobacco, and all told in sentence after sentence alike in their banality. It is hard to write so much without a single interesting turn of phrase but Mr. Box does it."
1,Where are the other reviews?,Would have liked to know what other readers thought - I care naught for what this author did on his book tour. One more ploy to force plogs on us.Phooey. In case anyone cares- I liked the book.
4,The Pickett series continues,"Joe Pickett seems to find trouble, or rather, it finds him. He never seems to keep to his scheduled work, he makes enemies, but has a nose for things not quite right, and won't let them rest. Good reading, couldn't wait for the next volume."
4,Great product for the price,This product is a great value for the price. I am giving it a 4 star because I wish it had more vitamin D.
4,Could be more accurate...,"The moment I opened this tab book, I knew I might be disappointed. I had been waiting with this book on order for 5 months and when i got the call that it was in stock, i ran to the shop to get it. I opened the page to ""Reptilia"", and immediately knew it was wrong! Ive seen the strokes 3 times, and I know how to play this - i had hoped the book would help polish it off. The opened riff is played a as a chord (kind off), with the top E held. It isnt show as this in the book. Despite this, its pretty good, with some little inversions of some chords which ARE wrong, but sound good nonetheless. Not a bad buy. ""Is This It"" tab book is a similar affair. However, they dont do justice to the best band on earth..."
2,Where is it?,I purchased this book because I was told that my husbands poem was going to be included. It is no where to be found. The format of the book is worse then a grade school yearbook layout. The publishers are obviously just wanting to make money.
1,stay away from this version!,"this DVD is unwatchable. i ordered it through the library at the institution where i teach. a sticker was affixed on the cover warning that this was a recorded DVD and may not play on all DVD equipment. nice disclaimer. the DVD cover is cheaply printed. the distributor, unknown video (sic!) should sell their product in the streets, rather than to educators. truly disgraceful."
3,"Nice Tent, but too long for backpacking","This is a nice tent, easy to set up, zippers work well enough, plenty of room to move around. What I didn't like, and therefor the reason I returned the tent, was that the poles are long when folded up. I was looking for a new tent to take backpacking, and space is pretty important in my pack. Each segment of the folded poles is 25"" long, way too long to be horizontal in my backpack, and nearly too long to be vertical. It does not list packed dimensions in the description online, but on the box it says that the packed dimensions are 25 x 6. To me, that is very important."
2,Mediocre at best,"Needs a TON of seam sealing and waterproofing, and a good ground cloth. There are better on the market for the same or less. It's a cloth floor, I had sturdy floors in tents from Walmart.Not the worst, but this is one I will keep as a loaner.Don"
3,"Not bad, but you can do better","The Tetragon 5 isn't a bad tent, but for about 25 bucks more, you can get the Apex 2XT that provides 5"" more length (which helps if you are 6' tall or more), and far superior blowing rain fly coverage, along with 2 doors and vestibules large enough to stow your packs. I just wish the Apex XT came in a more subdued color..."
4,Pretty Good Little Tent,Just used the tent on a recent canoe trip. Light rain the first night and worked well. Lots of room on the inside and packs fairly compact. Poles may need to be replaced eventually because they are cheep but overall its a good tent for the money.
5,Awesome Tent,"Awesome tent. This worked very well for me when I was up in the mountains. I plan on getting two more for my boys (10 and 12). Very easy to set up, take down, and clean."
4,Good Cyclo-Computer,"I don't think the negative reviews of this are fair. I have never seen the problems the others have described. It took about 10 minutes to install, and worked the first time out, with one small adjustment to move the speed sensor closer to the spokes. The HR monitor, as expected with Polar, works perfectly. The computer functions are not ""Apple like"" intuitive, but after about 5 minutes you should be able to use most of the functionality. The only complaint I have is that the setting function (time, bike, date, etc) only seem to go forward, so it is a pain to set the time to something like 7:49. It does far more than most riders will really need, computing calories burned based on entry of the persons weight, average speed, lap feature to divide a ride, total mileage, etc. I am very happy with mine and glad I made the choice. I do wish they included the rubber o-rings the manual mentions as options (probably more paint friendly) to using the zip ties."
4,Good for the money,"After reading the reviews on here I was a little hesitant to get this for my trek 3700. I will say this would have gotten 5 stars if the speed sensor would have worked with my bike, but I did purchase it knowing that there was the chance that it wouldn't work. Shipping was quick, heart rate monitor is top notch. Strap is a little small for bigger guys but it still works fine. I've been using it about 4 weeks now and it's really improved my performance biking. I'd definitely recommend it!"
2,Nice while it lasted,"I've been using one of these for two years now. Until recently it worked great. While I did have an occasional glitch, that I think might have been due to wireless driveway alert systems, it was pretty much flawless.......Until it started pausing due to 0 MPH while I was riding. It has become increasingly worse over the last month and since it's losing .2 to .5 miles on previously ridden 10 to 30 mile courses, is essentially useless as anything other than an HRM.I confirmed the magnet and sensor are set to specs. The sensor to computer distance is also within specs, and worked fine for 2 years. I emailed Polar service about the problem, no reply. I've bought a new speed sensor, still glitches. I've changed the battery in the computer, still glitches. At this point it appears the computer itself is bad, which means I'm going to be without one for who knows how long while I wait for Polar service to take a look at it."
1,Didn't work...,Bought it for a Trek 4500 mountain bike. The heart rate monitor worked with no problems. But the speed sensor would not work on my bike. The manual said it might not and it certainly didn't.
2,defective,"I have had a polar fitness watch for two years now that I have been very satisfied with. When my husband gave me this cycling computer for my birthday I was completely surprised and ecstatic. I immediately ran outside to install it. After 1.5 hours of trying to get a speed reading to appear we determined that the unit was broken. Based on reviews on other sites it is most likely the battery in the sensor is dead. Either way, too much of my life was wasted on this product. When there are many better ones out there. That being said, I did give it two stars because I don't have any reason to believe that every unit shipped is defective and if you get a working one it's probably ok."
5,A Great Winter Read,"The book got to me immediately. Even though the outcome was predictable it was great fun to get there. Besides being entertaining, the book was thought provoking and informative. I had one problem...it felt like Dana never had a female voice. Even after the transforming event he/she remained a male voice in the book. Inspite of that, I could not put the book down."
2,Dead book,"I was a Midwives fan and so thought I'd give this book a shot. I was so disappointed. I hoped to explore the soaring passion and power of transcendent love that lifts you out of any sense of time and space -but found the author to be limited in his ideas about gender and identity as well as love. To feel trapped in a body IS the hell of human existence. We all long to be seen and known for who we are in truth, and the culture-bound definitions of sexual identity used in this book don't provide me with enough to fall in love, either with the characters or their experiences. Much of it was too ""clever"", too shallow, too physical...too predictable..."
4,Trans-Sister Radio,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is the first book I've read on transsexuals or transgendered. Chris Bohjalian did his research and the book gave me incredible insight and sympathy to the difficulties that a transgendered or transsexual individual goes through. Though the book is fiction, you really develop feelings for the characters and it seems as if it were a real story. It has a beautiful and ironic ending. It is definitely worth reading.If you like this subject, you'll also like Luna by Julie Ann Peters and She's Not There by Jenny Boylan."
3,Interesting and Informative,"I enjoy a book for the way it's written as much as the storyline, and this author has a nice writing style. I also like to learn as I read, even if it's just the writer's perspective on a new subject.I used to work in the public office of a large utility company here in Southern California. We had a number of gays, transvestites and male transexuals as customers. I was always curious and somewhat troubled by the sad, almost haunted look I saw in the transexuals' eyes. And though they were usually transformed into beautiful women, that sadness never left. Now I understand why. I had never given much thought to what these people go through, having figured it was more a choice rather than a necessity.My criticism of the book? Rather slow, repetitive and plodding throughout, with a stupid and disappointing ending. Still, I read it to the end."
3,good but too long,i thought this book was pretty good but it was way to long everyone seems to be compaling about the ending i somehow saw it coming.
3,How Peculiar!,"""Trans-Sister Radio was very odd. I'm not saying that Dana was odd for getting the operation, just that the whole book struck me as odd. I could not remember who was talking in each chapter, therefor I would have to go back to the beginning to check. Allison was purely STUPID to think that she and Dana could just ""pick-up"" where they left off! WRONG! What made her think she would be happy with a female Dana minus a penis? She was not a lesbian. That was probably her biggest attraction to Dana in the first place. Dana turned out to be mostly selfish and I'm almost astonished at the fact that she decided she liked men after all. The one I felt sorry for was Patricia. She clearly lost out on a good man when Will turned to Allison and Dana."
4,A Generally True-Life Novel about Transition,"I enjoyed Mr. Bohjalian's book and his description of what a transsexual woman has to go through is generally accurate and well researched. As someone who is rather more immersed in this experience, I do have to say that the author has overemphasized the importance of SRS relative to all of the other transformations that a transsexual woman goes through. Often facial feminization surgury has a more profound effect on a trans woman's life than SRS. For some women, SRS is the only thing that really matters but for many of us it is more like the caboose at the end of a long train."
3,Mediocre,"He's got the Vermont small-town bigotry down and, from what I've read, he's got a pretty good portrayal of a typical M2F experience down, but Chris Bohjalian hasn't put together these elements into a good story. The topic's inherently interesting and works best with a trenchant style that explores ironies, delves deeply into the situations and twists our perceptions for a new perspective. I found this book novelistically, stylistically boring instead. Bohjalian's alternating first-person viewpoint did not exploit the format to give us a unique, memorable voice for each character, and his descriptions and dialogs, except for a line or two, remain unmemorable. Just because he got selected for Oprah's Book Club doesn't mean he's a good writer. Read Monique Proulx's The Sex of the Stars for a witty, original and perceptive view of transgendered people instead."
2,Just Okay,"Chris chose a hard to tackle topic. It most definitely had a twist, but the twist was so big it was hard to concentrate on the other things that were happening in the story. The switching of viewpoints with the radio transcripts in the middle was confusing. I kept asking myself why they were there."
1,Am I the only one who finds this ending completely false?,"I mean really. First of all, the idea is very original, and I looked forward to reading the book. I was very disappointed. Dana was extremely selfish and I felt no sympathy. She/he was an empty shell - I really knew nothing about her, aside from her gender difficulties. The use of four different points of view was unique, but they were too similar. It would've been better to stick to one. And the ending! Don't even get me started. Not recommended."
3,"pleasently surprised, but not as surprised as i'd like...","i was fully prepared to hate this book. i am inherently distrustful of anyone who tries to write through the eyes of a trans person when they themselves are not trans. however, the author here did an o.k. job. it wasn't sensationalized or as sterotypical as i expected. however, i felt there was at times a conflict of interest between educating and entertaining. although i enjoyed the book for the most part, i would caution readers against using this as a hand book for how transsexuals think and act. i would thank mr. bohjalian for not writing a bad depiction of this trans person, but i still felt like this book was written by an outsider."
2,Didn't ring true.,"Bohjalian is too talented a writer to rely on something as inherently sensational as transgender relationships and sex change operations. He did approach the topic with something new to offer -- how the operation affects the people around the transexual. But he quickly devolves into the expected -- and butchers any chance he has of making a statement about the nature of sex and gender and relationships, and how gender can transcend the physical.The idea that a man could be handsome as a man and equally gorgeous as a woman is ludicrous -- as is the idea that a woman would ""accept"" that her ex-husband becomes involved with the man/woman she used to date. Add to that the fact that the voices of his characters all sound the same (even the college-aged girl sounds exactly the same as her mother).Bohjalian wrote this with a heavy hand, and in doing so lost any chance of creating a meaningful story."
2,Writers get to describe their fantasies....,"Chris B. has a thing with girl-on-girl (...). I've read other books by him and it seems to be something he gets off on (not always girl-on-girl, --that only happens in this book.) In fact, it's like he wanted to write about it so then built the plot and characters around it. Which is fine, I mean hey, that's a writer's perrogative. I just didn't buy WHY Allie loved Dana so much, --I didn't feel any sparks from the first moment they met-- would a woman really lust after such a slight, effeminate man to the point where she wouldn't care if he became a woman? I just didn't buy the strength of that relationship. And when narrating from the four characters' POV, the writing was all very similar: meaning I didn't really get four distinct ""feels"" from them. The writing was pretty much the same across the board. I just thought this was an unrealistic, gratoutious and unbelievable story."
1,As if there isn't enough sex in our world already...,"I found this book to be little more than a Jerry Springer situation in novel form. Maybe some people like stories like that, but personally, I found Trans-Sister Radio to be centered completely around the subject of lust, NOT love, as well as a disgusting reflection on the morals of men and the objectivity of women. I shared it with my mother, and when she finished it, she threw it in the trash. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys real literature. Mr. Bohjalian writes a lot from a woman's point of view about sex. It makes me wonder if he has a gender identity problem himself."
4,Fascinating and Well-Handled,"This book on transgendered relationships was very interesting. I really enjoyed it. The plot, however, was a bit predictable, but the characterizations struck me as realistic. And I thought that the rather delicate subject matter was handled well. The detail on the surgery was a little - well, more than a little - graphic, but it was an important part of the story, even if it was not for the squeamish. I think Bohjalian is a very talented writer and I really enjoyed this book!"
3,"Intriguing, and yet so completely twisted...","I read this book as I LOVED Bohjalian's novels I had read previously, Law of Similars and Midwives. This, however, did not live up to my expectations as a story. True, the characters are well-developed and the personal conflicts are also described well. It's a love story that will indeed make you look differently at what and how you love. However, for people reading for the story as opposed to the writing... the ending was so twisted and implausible I actually yelled out loud at the book."
2,Disappointing,Although a timely and interesting subject - I found the writing to be poor and the characters one dimensional. This is not a book I would recommend. There were several interesting passages which accounts for the 2 stars but mainly Bohjalian harps on the same points over and over without adding anything new or thought provoking.
3,An unconventional love story...,"Having read both MIDWIVES and THE LAW OF SIMILARS, I must begin by saying that TRANS-SISTER RADIO is neither my favorite book by Mr. Bohjalian, nor his best. Yet, Mr. Bohjalian has taken a risque subject and crafted a well-written, intelligent and compelling novel. Told in the alternating voices of the four main characters---Allie, Carly, Will and Dana, TRANS-SISTER RADIO is a sensitive and thought provoking view of love, sexuality and gender that is sure to leave you examining your own emotions and beliefs long after the novel's end."
4,3.5 stars,"Interesting idea, I'm sure inspired by real life. I saw a tv show about transgendered people once where they interviewed a couple that was once a man and woman married. The man was transgendered, yet his wife stayed with him even after he became a woman so they could raise their children together. However, the wife was not gay and they lived together as friends.I thought this book might be going in the same direction based on the title because of the word sister. I thought maybe Allie and Dana would end up living together as sisters/best friends.Without giving too much away, the ending was typical of this author. While I didn't find Will's actions unbelievable, I'm not sure Dana would make that decision if this were real life.At times I found the book a bit slow and the whole radio thing seemed like a gimmick to make the title fit the book. I would like to read a fictional book about this topic written by a transgendered person."
3,Very good until a lousy ending ruins it!,"Chris Bojalian has an engaging, provocative premise here: what happens to a romantic relationship between two people of the opposite sex when one-half of the couple undergoes a sex-change? What does that make the relationship in the eyes of the other half---and in the eyes of the people around them? For the most part, Bojalian makes the dilemmas and conflicting emotions each of his characters experience come alive and resonate. Unfortunately, in the last fifty or so pages, he succumbs to the urge to wrap it up neatly with a ""happily ever after"" ending that feels completely false given what's come before. This error in judgement left a sour taste in my mouth when I finished the book, and it derails what up to then had been a very powerful view of gender issues and ""couple-ness."" What a shame."
5,informative topic - sensitively written,"This was a real page-turner for me, an elementary teacher who can identify with a critical administrator who can too often cave into parental pressure over creative teaching. The trans-gender story line was handled in a believable and thorough manner focusing on gender feelings of all four main characters. I especially liked Mr. Bohjalian's expressive vocabulary and humorous similes, ie. ""despotic pinhead"". I could easily picture these characters experiencing the story's changing events over a year's time."
2,waste of money,"The video is well made. However, there is no way in the world one can learn to breastfeed from a video. So, save your money and don't make my mistake."
4,The key word is PROGRAMMING....,"This is a well laid out book providing a great overview of developing a workflow from start to finish. Several chapters outline the tools and techniques for analyzing the process before you start coding. You'll build a working application as the book progresses.There is a considerable amount of JAVA code and some LotusScript used. The code is well laid out and well documented.If you're an up and coming programmer, especially interested in JAVA, this book may be for you. If hard core programming is not your cup of tea....you'll probably want to look at one of the graphical workflow development tools for Domino."
2,More of a companion to a database than a programming book,"This book is essentially the details of a single workflow application written with Java agents. I'd estimate over a third of the book is just the Java agents printed out in widely spaced formatting. The first quarter of the book is a very broad overview of workflow diagramming and what is Notes. The rest is the fields and forms they used, some description of the agents printed in the book, and similar things.The book is more like a companion to the database on the cd, rather than the other way around. If you're looking for a Domino workflow application that's similar to what they wrote or for a sample of one workflow application with Java agents, then it's worth a look. Even though I buy most of my books through Amazon just based on the descriptions, you might want to flip through this one in a bookstore first; it's not what I expected from a programming book. I was through with it in less than 2 hours and I'm not a fast reader."
3,Fresh aspects for a Notes Book,Fresh aspects for Notes programmers that don't have a background in OOP and UML.Too bad the sample application around which the whole book is based on does not seem to work in my edition.
3,Limited Use,This figure does not have separated legs. The tunic is easily removed by children breaking it. Disappointing. Perhaps this item is better for collectors than for children.
1,Rather Disappointing!,"Some great pictures, I won't deny, but particularly, my expectations were way beyond that what I could get from this book. Most of the pictures are in plain old B&W, instead of being in living colors. The great majority don't even have a subtitle, therefore, we get a little lost sometimes. Besides, as this book was supposed to be something like a filming diary, it could depict much more behind-the-scenes stills, making of candids and so on, and even could show some text in it. I think if you only like to see pictures then the book will be ok, but if you're a die hard fan, searching for news about the filming of the picture, then this book will be the wrong choice. I think maybe to those photo admirers the book will be a disappointing, so, I wouldn't recommed it at all. I am quite disappointed myself!"
1,Bond on Set - Filming Die Another Day,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. When you get a book that involves the making of a movie, you look for details in set location, make-up, special effects, etc. This book is 95% pictures. I wanted information not pictures. Therefore, this book was a waste of time and money for me. There was a similar book for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", but that book described the movie making procewss in detail. That was the way that this one should hav ebnn written."
2,Easy to follow recipes,"The recipes are very good, easy to follow and acessible for someone who isn't an experienced cook like me. The only complaint I have is that there isn't an index of recipes, or even a meaningful table of contents which details the menu of each meal. This is why I am only giving this book 2 stars."
2,a weak story,"i could'nt continue the book .in my opinion it's a weak story ,i tried to go on with the reading but could'nt ,i found the book lacks lots of things among them a real romance story....Lucy is very shalow and even ryder tremayne was very poorly writing,sorry.it's not worth it ."
4,Niagra Falls or Does It,1. The Book is about Hank. He is assigned an essay about what he did last summer. He went to Niagra Falls. But he figures its more creative to Build a model of Niagra Falls. When showing it in class a leak tuns into a disaster. Read the book to find out what happens.2. The Book was very funny3. Conflict is he has to take responsbility for his actions.4. 4 Stars for this book. Because it was funny.
4,Fun Book!,"Bought this book for my 12 yr old son to read and take an AR Test. Since he didn't choose the book, he says he didn't like it. I had him read it out loud to me and I thought it was funny and cute. To each his own I guess. I'm thinking it was a little too ""young"" of a book for him."
5,Niagra Falls or Does it?,I bought this for my forth grader who is struggling reading. It is a second grade book but is funny and keeps him entertained. It works great for him.
4,"Niagra Falls, or Does It","Niagara Falls, Or Does It? #1 (Hank Zipzer)My name is Jacob i read this book for my summer reading project.This book is about a 4th grader named Hank Zipzer who has a learning disability. Hank needs to write a essay on what he did over the summer, but he can't think of anything to write about. So Hank decided to build Niagara Falls instead.i liked this book because it's funny and people can get a good laugh out of it.i would reccomend this book to anyone because it's a good book to read."
5,A Great Book for Reluctant Readers!,"This is a great book for reluctant readers(or any readers for that matter)! We introduced this book to our 5th grade struggling readers, and they loved it! We heard them laughing out loud as they read, and they needed no ""encouragement"" from us teachers to keep reading the book. Others students in the class noticed the popularity of the book and wanted to read the book, too. When students finished this book, they wanted to read the next books in the series. (It's a rare book indeed that entices struggling or reluctant readers to want to read more.)The writing is clever and funny, and the vocabulary is accessible for 4th and 5th grade struggling readers. I think many of our students identified with Hank's struggles. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Worth buying,"I have 3 kids who are dyslexic in one form or another. My husband and I are also dyslexic, but I wasn't discovered until we started diagnosing my oldest. I bought the books after seeing Henry Winkler's interview on TV. I have been reading them to my kids at night. After three chapters, my oldest asked me if this kid is dyslexic. The book is well written and enjoyable to read. I have enjoyed this peek into one type of a dyslexic mind so much that I am buying several copies to give to some of the teachers at my childrens' school."
3,I Have Always Wanted To Go To Niagara Falls,"Niagara Falls Or Does It, is a book you can call a page turner. It takes place in Hank Zipzer's school where he must face the challenges that his teacher Mrs. Adolf gives him. The book is about the main charecter Hank, and how his teacher Mrs. Adolf assigned him a paper that he has to write a five paragraph essay on what he did over his summer vacation. But instead of writing the paper hank has something else in mind. One thing I learned from this story is always stick to the assignment the teacher gave out, don't try and make up your own. I would also like to say that I would recomend this book to anyone between the ages 9 and up. By being a first person narrotive story this book really showed me what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes."
4,An excellent guide for new or experienced mothers,"I found this book to be especially helpful in creating different ideas for meal times for my 23 month old daughter. She was not a picky eater to begin with, but it made me feel better knowing that her refusing to eat on certain days was perfectly normal. Being nine months pregnant, it was also helpful to review the early eating habits I can look forward to reliving. It is broken down into a simple step by step plan for introducing new foods and maintaining some consistency in your childs diet. The book is very easy to use and to read. It has useful sections of ""Do's and Dont's"" for each phase of development. The front flap also works as a bookmark, so that you can keep it set to the section that is age appropriate for your child. This book would make a wonderful shower gift for a first time mom."
4,"Better than II, but weak in some areas","Some lessons are very good. But others are not, and some are just review of the last ones (for thirty minutes).I would definitely recommend it. They changed the male speaker, but I think both are equally good."
5,The Best,After finishing levels 1 and 2 I tried level 3. Like the first 2 levels it was excellent. I have been told that my pronunciation is very good which is a big challenge when learning Mandarin. I only wish Pimsleur offered another level as I like its method of teaching.
2,Poor at best,"Product has many of the same problems the Mandarin I and II had. Limited, narrow vocabulary (some 'new' words are repeats of earlier programs); no emphasis on tones, nothing written regarding the lessons except a basic overview. If you want to speak very limited basic Mandarin, this will help. If you want to learn Mandarin properly, you will need supplements, or you're wasting your time with these products."
2,Not a very good ratcheting device.,"I purchased this because it was cheap. As a screwdriver for light jobs it works fine. What I don't like is the ratcheting mechanism. For example, when you try to screw with it, if the screw is loose or medium loose you can't take advantage of the ratcheting. Because every time you try to use it the screw will move backwards. It's not until your screw is tight that you can really enjoy the ratcheting mechanism. I decided to purchase a Stanley 68-010 10 and it's much better. It goes for about 3 dollars more than this one here at Amazon and it's well worth the price. Plus the handle on the Stanley is bigger and made of rubber."
2,Poor mechanism,"I've used this driver for the past two years, and the ratchet mechanism has started to fail. When turning it under load (which is something one does pretty often with a screw driver :D) it slips into the ""locked"" position. It looks like the setting is held in place by a spring-loaded metal ball secured between two plastic ridges. Those ridges have worn down, allowing the ball to slip."
3,MISS LABLED?,"This is a rerelease of the Philip Marlowe collection labled as season 1 when it's really season ""2"". If you don't have the collection already, the sound and picture is as good and it takes up less shelf space but it's not the season 1. If you have the ""Philip Marlowe collection"" you'll just be doubling up."
1,"Philip Marlowe, the Silent Version","I liked this show when it was on HBO, but the Mill Creek Entertainment DVD release is literally up the creek. The audio is horrible and the whole thing plays like a silent film. The audio is so low I turned my sound up to the maximum, and it was still like listening to whispering at Church on Sunday."
2,Questionable sound quality,"When played on my DVD player & TV, the sound quality of these discs is terrible. I had to crank the volume up to hear the dialog, which then got lost in a hiss. Meanwhile, the music level is fine -- which means when the volume is up, you get lots of hiss punctuated by huge blasts of saxophone. (I've only had sound issues with 1-2 other DVDs on my player, out of 100s, but the player is about 4 years old and the TV is about 10).The sound quality seems okay, when played on a Mac computer, or on a newer DVD player & digital TV."
3,Only O.K.,"Although a big fan of Raymond Chandler, I had never seen this production. It's only OK. The filming of this in either Toronto or the UK does not add to it as you lose all sense of Los Angeles at that time. The portrayal of Marlowe does not convey his wit and humor. It should have been much better. I would like to see the 1960 version of Marlowe done as a tv series but I do not know if it is easily available."
4,Not what is described,"This figure is advertised as having a freeze frame action slide. I received the basic version without the slide. I will contact the seller and update if there is any change. I bought this figure specifically for the action slide(well, the figure too, but the slide was a major selling point.) I am very disappointed that I did not receive the item I paid good money for. I do not like giving negative reviews because, I realize that it is an important selling point especially for online stores. I will however gladly revise my review if the problem is fixed.*UPDATE*The seller got back to me right away, they went above and beyond to fix my problem, there was no conflict at all. the transaction was very smooth, and all is forgiven. I would gladly do business with the seller again in the future."
5,Bucking the Sarge,Bucking the Sarge: is a nice addition to this collection. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in novels for urban youth.
1,junk software,"Wouldn't install, Print Master or 3D. In fact 3D registered me but did not complete the installation and when I e-mailed Broderbund about this problem, I got no response what so ever. Tried to return the junk software and store wouldn't take it back."

3,over the average,it is good from outside and inside the problem was with the brightnessit seems there is somthing wrong with the brightnes and the pc connectiondoesn't work but alot of vocabulary
5,Grim Tuesday,Marvelous series! Must own. Read them as a child and again as an adult! Loved it just as much if not more. Beautifully written with deep themes for children and adults!
3,Too similar to the first,"In the second of Garth Nix's Keys to the Kingdom series, we see Arthur ... do exactly what he did in the first. Yes there are a few new monsters to destroy, and a tiny little bit of the mystery shrouding the Monday book is being lifted, but other than that its copy and pasted from Mr. Monday. The ending is almost comical, and had me shaking my head at Arthur for his stupidity (while in the back of my mind I hoped that Wednesday would not be as formulaic as Tuesday had been).It's worth reading, because the series is interesting, but it doesn't have the flair that Monday did."
4,ONE MORE DAY IN THE WORK WEEK,"In this sequel to MISTER MONDAY in the Keys to the Kingdom series the rest of the days of the week are ganging up on Arthur Penhaligon, the heir to the Will. They are threatening to repossess Earth and Arthur is forced to return to the House and fight the evil Grim Tuesday.To survive he's going to need friends, allies, magic and a whole lot of luck. He wishes he still had his key from Monday but of course he gave that up trying to remain human, now it may get him killed!A great story for young adults with plenty of action, magic and more than a little suspense.I RECOMMEND it. If you or your child/teen liked MISTER MONDAY you're going to like GRIM TUESDAY."
4,"Didn't quite meet my expectations, but good anyways","Grim Tuesday, which is the sequel of Mister Monday, starts off when Arthur Penhaligon gets a phone call from the Will. The Will tells Arthur that Grim Tuesday wants to claim the Lower House as his in order to pay off all of Monday's debt. A little while later, things start going from bad to worse for the Penhaligon family and Arthur has no other choice but to enter the House and try to defeat Grim Tuesday.Though the plot is a bit better that Mister Monday, I find Arthur's role a little too cheesy. Though he does encounter some problems, I find that he always ends up defeating the enemy no matter what and this is starting to become a bit too repetitive. However, I guess that if Arthur were to die, there would be no point in continuing the story, so this heroic act is acceptable.Overall, the book is quite good, and I'm definitely looking forward to Drowned Wednesday."
4,The biggest pit in history,"The Far Reaches: A smog-full Place which is almost completly filled by a pit. Grim Tuesdays pit. A pit that is used to mine nothing, a substance which everything is made of. Arthur is still recovering from monday, but he is already being attacked by Grim Tuesday. As Arthurs life and family are constantly attacked, Arthur must find his way into the house and defeat Grim Tuesday. With a good plot and amazing characters, though with a few downpoints, Garth Nix makes another amazing book, though it is a notch down from Monday."
1,Not worth the money,"Grim Tuesday was just a remake of Mister Monday. The whole plot is the same- Arthur must find his way into the House and navigate his way to Tuesday's key. The story moved very slowly and did not hold my interest well because I was not particularly interested in any of the characters. Arthur has no special abilities that would make me like his character. He is just a boring, normal boy who follows orders from the Atlas. Suzy Blue is an annoying character with very little appeal, and all of the members of the House are like robots with no real impact on the novel. I couldn't finish the book because of the monotony and I don't recommend it to anyone who likes a fast-paced book."
1,real watchpro,"I had bought and already returned this watch. This was my first Amazon watch. Unfortunately I didn't get what was advertised as a new product and was very disapointed. It came in a worn and torn outer white box with deep,aged red paint marks inside it. The watch itself did not have neither plastic protector wraps on the bracelet nor the original tags or warranty cards from Cartier. At a heartbeat, looking at it, anyone could tell that the watch was either a high mileage display model or a worn item. At a closer look, without even a magnifier, I noticed some visible scratches and dirt glued into the bracelet and the case. The back of the watch also had the signs of wear.I own quite a few of upscale timepieces, starting from Rolexes Daytona SS, 18K... and up to Vacheron, Audemars and Patek. Never thought of Cartier but ladies versions. So I know my watches.Sadly it was an unpleasant experience for me and I think I have to disclose it."
3,What A Tease...,"The production is slick. The dance tunes very much reflect the early 80's dance/pop/r&b era where an R&B artist would blend or meld some pop in the mix to crossover. Some tracks will have a Whitney Houston debut foreboding characteristic since Preston Glass and Narada Michael-Walden produced hits for various Arista artists of the time....Nothing wrong with that, but much of the ""soulfullness"" is compromised in some of the tunes for generic Flashdance dance tracks. The best tunes are the slow to mid tempo lushly produced ballads. The combination of Bofill's voice and polished electronic sounds create an unforgettable atmosphere or ambiance ! Basically, it's in the rich hooks and catchiness of a few tracks that make the listener hope the entire concept or sound would be carried out...wrong. Teaser is just a tease, and a good one at that."
1,Wrong CD,"I just picked up a supposed copy of ""Big Loada."" Luckily, I'd read the reviews below from people who got the ""wrong"" CD when they purchased what they thought was this disc. I did too: I got ""Budakahn Microphone."" It's labeled as if it's ""Big Loada"" but it's not. Evidently there's a run of bad discs. What's interesting to contemplate is how many people are out there thinking they're listening to ""Loada"" when they're listening to something else. You don't have to be a Squarepusher expert to tell: if your copy of ""Loada"" has 7 tracks on it, it's REALLY ""Budakahn Microphone."" ""Big Loada"" has 12 tracks. Who knows when the ""real"" ""Loada"" will once again be available."
4,"Certainly not relaxing, but oddly intriguing...","If the Aphex Twin decided to compose on a binge of speed and massive amounts of cocaine, the result would sound similar to Squarepusher. Listening to the Big Loada EP is strangely reminiscent of a bad experience at the dentist or perhaps even a nightmare of electro-shock therapy. Yet the sound of hyperactive bass roaring over a magnitude of ear-shattering percussion is oddly intriguing here, although repeated listens of such tracks like ""Come On My Selector"" and ""Full Rinse"" may cause disorientation, fits of delirium, and the questioning of one's sanity."
2,Overrated-no matter what RDJ says,All of this guys albums sound the same.Being different doesn't give you a license to push boring music.
4,A drill-and-bass genius,"Squarepusher is, like Aphex Twin, a tireless arranger and manipulator of beats. On Big Loada, Squarepusher takes the drill-and-bass aesthetic to new extremes. However, it is his abundance of melodic ideas that makes Big Loada a great record: come on my selector has a jumpy, exciting bassline; a journey to needham sounds like Vangelis on speed; port rhombus includes acoustic guitar strumming with furious storming drum machines. It is amazing that, of all people, Trent Reznor has picked up Squarepusher's catalog to distribute here in the states: more power to him."
3,"good, to a point","I like Squarepusher's work, but sometimes I have the impression that his artistic efforts are inconsistent. On one side, this is clearly jazz-minded music: it sounds ""as if"" some musician was improvising. On the other side, this is no improvisation, and the musical palette available to a computer is much flatter than that produced by a jazz quartet. On repeated listenings, the lack of improvisation shows up. Another criticism I have is that the electronic paraphernalia don't mask a certain melodic monotonicity. Other than this, ""big loada"" is solid work and a good electronica album. I would also recommend Budakhan Mindphone"" of the same artist."
1,Beware. Uses mechanical instruments.,The singers on this CD use mechanical instruments. This absolutely defiled the beautiful Sacred Harp music tradition. Not recommended.
5,Like Tuesdays with Morrie -- only it's Wednesdays with Mary,"A heartwarming true story for all ages, with incredible color paintings by a talented Charleston artist.This would be a great gift for moms, sisters, grandmoms. A must-read for anyone who loved When I Am An Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple, or The Secret Life of Bees!Here's to Alfreda and to all the wise women at the Hebron Zion Church on John's Island. You are an inspiration!"
5,insightful,"This is a very well done book on a number of levels. First, if you buy it because you like Mary Whyte, you will love her more when you are done reading it. There is a depth that the stories tell that add to the pictures though the pictures could stand alone if need be. The second is the life that the pictures add to the snippets told. It makes you want to meet these women and the hearts that they have. It also makes you realize that a painting says something. As it tells the story, the words put icing to the cake. I look forward to the next book that she has coming out."
5,Alfreda's World,I love Mary Whyte's work...she captures the essence of her subjects and this book is of no exception.
5,"Snappy, straight answers about kids' ills, and fun to read","Midway through Pediatric Home Companion the author sticks her neck out and answers the question: ""What do you do when your [the author's] kids have colds?""""At bedtime,"" she writes, ""I frequently drug them with Benadryl. . . . (Sometimes I take it instead!"") Dr. Wiseman gives straight answers to the big questions about childhood health problems. That's what makes this book easily understood. It's snappy and fun to read too.I was lucky rearing my three kids. Neither their mother nor I knew a lot about taking care of children (There weren't any good books on the subject then.) So, we worried a lot! But they grew up healthy, smart and sometimes smart-elecky! Lisa, the only girl, went to medical school. I was very proud. Now she has three fantastic children of her own, but she was too modest to put their picture on the cover of her book, PEDIATRIC HOME COMPANION!Julius Grossenbacher"
5,For astrology buffs,"A Gemini, Vin Packer became interested in the ideaof astro-twins and the theory that anyone born exactlywhen you were, to the minute, is your astrology twin.Such a person will share the same traits with you,marriage date, habits, as though some behing-the-scenesforce is creating a mutual destiny.Archie Gamble findsthe person with whom he shares a parallel life, and boydoes he wish he hadn't!"
3,"Good item, poor response","This is a good deal for the book. The book is like-new as described in the website. However, the seller did not response to my question when I asked about the late delivery."
3,Gift in the field of Educational Measurement,This book is realy a gift for those persons who are working in educational Measurement.
5,Nice collectible from 1997,"This is from the Kenner Star Wars green card with hologram Power of the Force (POTF) collection of 1997. It is a great rendition of Princess Leia as Jabba the Hut's slave. It is a great mold, really well done. The costume is a perfect match. The chain around the neck is removable, just like in the movie."
4,Excellent Product,I can't wait to give this to my son for Christmas so he can add it to his collection. Good product at a good price.
3,Dog Grooming,"Ordered this together with a CD on dog grooming. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time in good condition. It was somewhat helpful, but probably could have done without it. The CD, of course, was better at illustrating grooming technique."
1,Why do they waste paper on this?,"I found this book to be an insult to a person who desires to groom a hairy dog for the first time. The overview of tools and procedures is so far from adequate for that purpose that I had to wonder who the audience is for this book. It must be the HSUS-member-non-pet-owner who wants to look at the clean little pictures so they can present themselves as the next pet expert. I finally found the *Everything Book of Dog Grooming* that has a thorough and gentle set of instructions for training the dog and grooming person to do an effective, pleasant and safe job of cleaning up the dog."
4,All 87 Breed Dog Grooming,I love this book. Very informative with clear step by step instructions on how to groom different dogs. Offering good information for the beginner with colour pictures.
2,Missing Details,I don't think the instructions were detailed enough. I have cocker spaniels and even the pictues don't show how to trim the back of the head or under the chin
4,All 87 Breed Dog Grooming for the Beginner,I ordered this book for a friend that has started working at a dog grooming shop. She found that it is very informative.
1,I found it useless,This is probably the worst book I have ever read. The general information on grooming was short and superficial. I was looking for information on clippers and blades and this had almost no information in 6 paragraphs. The coverage on each breed is so short that it is useless.
3,SOMEWHAT INFORMATIVE,"ITS AN OKAY BOOK, IM SURE THERE IS MORE INFORMATIVE BOOKS AVAILABLE. TELLS YOU THE BASICS ON TRIMMING EVERYTHING BUT THE BODY. TELLS YOU ABOUT TRIMMING THE UNDERCARRIAGE,TRIMMING THE BACKEND AND NAILS, BUT NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART(THE BODY)."
5,The sub-title says it all.,"In the me-first society in which we live, Shannon Kubiak Primicerio's Being a Girl Who Serves offers a refreshing premise: How to find your life by giving it away. Written to girls from early teens to women of all ages, it is a guide to becoming a servant in the image of Christ. Shannon shares many practical, personal examples of people who have heeded the call to servanthood...and changed their world as a result. A great personal devotional or study guide for a small group, Being a Girl Who Serves is a book every reader will love and benefit from.Also recommended: Being a Girl Who Loves & God Called a Girl, by Shannon Kubiak Primicerio"
1,Hardly a decade,"Bought 12 of these bulbs less than 2 years ago. At $7 per bulb, you expect them to truly last. Installed about 6 of them right away. Now less than 2 years later (I know it is less than 2 years as I have only been in my house 20 months) 4 of these bulbs have burned out. I called Feit... they started asking about power surges, etc. None of my 6 computers or three stereos or 5 televisions are having any power problems. They want me to package up the bulbs for review (and I suspect rejection), I think I will pass. Beware! they do not live up to spec in any way!"
3,the light that burns longer burns dimmer,"I've been using 3 of these for a year now. I have them on a dimmer but I would say I have that dimmer at max about 80% of the time. I would estimate that I use those bulbs about 700 hours per year. None of them have burned out yet.On the other hand, they are clearly dimmer than the same-type same-wattage ""normal"" bulbs. I do not have a light meter, but I would guess that they are something like 70 to 80% as bright.For most of my needs that means they are still a good deal (assuming that the longevity claim is valid). But this is something you have to take into account.Also -- the manufacturer should clearly state in the technical details the luminosity of these bulbs. Failure to do so is deceptive."
4,Beautiful Voice,"A friend of mine burned a copy of this cd and gave it to me to check out. I just LOVE Marta's voice and the way she show's expression. I know this cd has been around for a while.. but I don't care. I still play it very often.I espically love ""Eso Es El Soul"". Who wrote that song?They should get that person to write for Marta""s next group of songs... Keep it up Marta. I can't wait to hear your next works."
1,Disappointing,"My introduction to Sanchez was the album ""Mi Mundo,"" which I was nuts about. This album seemed watered down and an obvious grab for total mainstream success....the result was music that contained none of the originality and bite of ""Mi Mundo"", and I wouldn't recommend it at all."
3,Awsome tree watering device.,"This device is a lifesaver in hot dry weather on small or newly planted trees & shrubs. We got thru the hottest & dryest summer on record in Oklahoma, with 4 newly planted trees. We kept the watering bags filled, and the trees actually thrived in all that heat.One problem, animals will sometimes chew on them causing them to lose water; also, grass trimmers are hard on them. One too close trimmer will ruin it!"
3,Good idea - a lot of work,Product delivers on its promise to consistenly water the tree and the company is very reliable. Filling the bag(s) requires bringing a hose to it frequently so that it is really most useful for foundation plantings or trees quite close to the water source. We found frequent unreeling of 150 of hose to be unrewarding.
5,Got Trees,"If you get baby trees you really need these because they will need alot of TLC, the treegator is wonderful."
4,Excellent product,"Works great. Easy to fill. Helps establish new trees, and even better bringing trees back to health in a drought. Better than leaving a hose running for hours then forgetting it's on!"
2,releases water too fast,"not a bad product. it releases the water way too fast. if was over a two day or three day period at a slow drip, it would be a great product. however, this releases all of its water within a day."
1,zipper broke before we could fill it.,Junk. The zipper broke before we could fill the bag completely. I have owned s landscaping company for ten years and these seemed like a great watering aid for those without irrigation but its just a waste.
5,Watering a Tree,"A very good product works as advertised. I use it during the spring and summer on our new tree, at least once a week to insure the tree gets enough water."
3,Prefer the donut gator,"This is easy to zip up around a new tree and do some soaking.However, I found during my first watering that there was water left in the bottom. Not a lot, but it didn't drain out totally.Also, I worry there is insufficient air flow around the trunk.All in all, I prefer the smaller donut soaker made by gator. That leaves airflow around the trunk and seemed to drain better. I think that one has a smaller capacity, but I still prefer it."
3,Good on level ground,"This product will work fine on level ground. However, if your tree is on a steep hill, once it fills with water, it will come unzipped and lay like a fat blob. It will help your trees if on level ground."
4,"The idea is grand, however...","it's a grand idea - a real water saver, especially with our recent drought. However, we've had difficulty getting it positioned so it drains in 10+ hrs. - even after following directions to adjust when filling. Just be sure to check that it is dripping after you set it up - then it works great!"
2,"I REALLY wanted to like this, but....","I simply could not get the product to work as promised. I tried it with three different trees, built up the level of mulch around the trees, etc. In all cases: no matter what I did, the water wound up running out beneath the bottom edge. The bag simply did not fill.I ordered two of these, and will hold on to one in the hope that the product works better with newly planted saplings"
3,An ok product,"The Tree Gator is a great idea, but it could be improved. My main problem with the Tree Gator is that I thought it slowly released water over several days. Actually, the water is all gone after several hours. For future models, there is a fabric they could use in the TG that would release the water slower and thus reduce the frequency of refills. This would probably add to the cost though. Another idea would be to make the flap that covers the water intake hole sealable. Since it's not currently sealable, mosquitoes can get in the TG and lay eggs in the water."
3,"This March Isn't Too Hard a Slog, But Not Fully Satisfying","Not really my favorite rendition of an ancient work, but Mr. Rouse does deliver what he promises - a modern prose retelling of the story of the march of the 10,000 Greek mercenaries out of Persia home to Greece. The result is a workmanlike book of 240 pages with endpaper maps of the route taken by the Greeks. The translation/transliteration of the Greek, Persian, and other ancient names jarred a little since they did not match my expectations based upon previous exposure to other versions of the story. A summary of the story is presented in the preface along with some background on the translation and on surviving ancient manuscript forms of the narrative. I must confess to a preference for the poetic translations, even knowing that such translations cannot in truth convey the full feeling and language of the original text."
5,A masterpiece of literature!,This book is a fascinating account of one of the most tragic eras in world history. Otto Scott is an amazing historian.
3,entertaining enough,"i enjoyed this interesting western starring Clark gable.it's not your typical rip roaring action packed western.it's more of a lite comedy/romance.most of it takes place in one setting.a deserted ghost town inhabited by our young widows and their no nonsense gun packing mother in law.manly this is a showcase for the comedic skills of Gable and his co stars.the banter back and forth between the group is the highlight of the piece.oh,there's also 100,000 in stolen gold hidden nearby.add in some romance and a bit of deception and you have the makings of an entertaining little movie.for me,The King and Four Queens is a 3/5"
3,"Great movie, cheap DVD","This is not about the movie, a true gem if there ever was one - this is about the DVD. Fox has been busy screwing up their releases of MGM movies again : in spite of the mentions on the jacket, there are no subtitles or captions whatsoever on this DVD, not even a menu: so, HoH and foreign customers beware..."
3,King and Four Queens,This was a fun movie....Gable was his jolly self. I worked on this movie and doubled Gable several times in more of his films. He was a remarkable man.
4,Maltin has it wrong. Good movie.,"Perhaps Mr. Maltin doesn't like amoral tales, but there is a lot more to this story than meets the eye. Gable's character is amoral. The wives (3 of the 4 are widows, not knowing which husband survived his criminal past) are amoral. And the bible thumping mother in law, protecting money stolen by her sons, has got to be seen as amoral. Very good character development. A taunt tale. Gable looks like his classic, powerfull self. The actresses, though basicly unknowns, put in fine performances - and are easy on the eyes to look at, as well."
2,the autobiography of a jerk,"After Reich came to national attention with his best-selling Greening of America, he made a fool of himself by writing this revealing autobiography, in which he comes across (to me, at least) as a jerk. This is particularly evident in the section in which he describes how he was totally unaware that he was gay well into his adulthood, and that it was necessary for his students to point this out to him. Duhhh, well, gee, whaddaya know? So he went out and picked up a teenage hustler and thanked the boy for making a difference in his life. Sheesh."
5,Barzun rocks the house,"I came upon this book when reading reviews for Barzun's more recent ""From Dawn to Decadence"". The very positive reviews about ""The House of intellect"" are absolutely right...this is a masterpiece. Where ""From Dawn to Decadence"" is a wonderful historical panorama, ""The House of Intellect"" instructs how the intellect should properly be used. He starts with a criticism of the misuse of intellect by the educators of his day, and then moves on to cover the proper use of intellect in all our modern affairs. Most insightful was his admonition to understand how truly dangerous ideas can be! Finally, he even applies intellect to the romantic side of mental life, including affairs of the heart. Ideas, intellect, intellectual, ideologue--don't be confused about what these mean. Read it...it will change how you think!"
2,beautifully written book cheaply produced,"This is a wonderful book, however, this printing is cheap. The paper is thin and has a newsprint quality and the type quality is poor. In the hardback copy there are photographs which do not appear in this paperback. I was really disappointed. If you can find it, pay a few dollars more and get the hardback."
2,"Not No, but hell no","If you read my review of Anais' ""Journal of Love"", you must certainly have discerned my feelings about this Diary."
4,a beautiful book,"I read it some time ago... but I do remember the equanimity of Anas when she faced suffering, cancer, and death. In this diary, - as in most of her last diaries - the writer is hidden in a specific way. She does not speak to much directly about herself... her feelings. etc., She writes about art, the movies she liked, books, her correspondence with artists or writers (like the argentinian Julio Cortázar), or her trips to Japan, and Bali. She tried to think of death as a ""joyous transformation"", a release of the spirit, so it can visit all other lifes. A beautiful book."
3,disappointed,"art: **** very prettyproduction: ***** dmps manga are among the best!story: ** 1/2while the manga does have very pretty art, and the editing & printing jobs are top notch, i found the story to be somewhat dissapointing.although well self-contained, the story was cliche and a little too saccharine sweet for my liking; the lead may as well have been a girl (this coming from a fan of bl ^^;).not to say the story is bad; just overhyped - if i knew what it was like, i would not have bought it...recommended to people who like fluffy, cliche, utterly predictable, simple, sickly sweet, innocent stories; if ur tastes are a little more sophisticated, look elsewhere."
4,Lovely art and likeble characters,The artwork is lovely and the characters are likable though I didn't warm up to Kazuki until the later half.The characters don't go beyond kissing but that suits the story.
4,Great CD,"The variety of music on the CD was great. We were a little concerned about the quality as there seemed to be a residue on the CD right out of the package and it hung up on the second song. However, once we cleaned the CD, it played without a problem. We heard many songs that were new to us. Much more instrumental tunes than we were expecting."
5,Outstanding,"Nothing will ever replace the fold-out cover and enclosed book and poster of the original vinyl packaging, but the songs...and the sound. It's all here. And it's outstanding."
4,Waterman Phileas Fountain Pen,"For the price I have been very impressed with this pen. The ink flow is consistent, which is my biggest problem with other fountain pens in that when I go to write it takes awhile for the ink to begin flowing. With the Waterman Phileas it flows immediately and evenly. The pen remains clean and there is no leakage of ink along the nib. Overall I am very satisfied as this pen writes as well or better than my other fountain pen that cost 50% more."
3,Good pen AT A REASONABLE PRICE,I collect fountain pens and have over 300. The waterman Phileas is my favorite general use pen for day to day use. The problem is the more common colors should cost around $25-30. I see plenty of them listed online for well over $150. That is insane. Do not ever pay more than $50 for any of them without friggin' gold plating!
5,it works!,"for ridding the grounds of poison ivy & other undesired brush -this is the answer.Carpenter ants are a problem here; so keeping a 'clear' zone around a building they might infest is paramount. Kill all vegatation around an out-building and ant-infestation is much less of a problem. This product will do exactly that - give the home-owner a clear-zone around buildings to lessen prospects of insect-infestation. Works will clippings, mowing won't.EZ to apply (follow label directions)it's 'just-the-ticket' around tree-trunks. phone poles; cracks in cement sidewalks."
2,Wrong container advertised!,"I use herbicides sparsely but I do spray poison ivy every year. Don't get me wrong, Roundup for Poison Ivy is a reliable product. I was excited to find 24 oz concentrate (in the rectagular container) at a price that saved over $10 per container over Home Depot prices...so I ordered three. Before I was notified that my order shipped, I noticed the photo of the container changed to the premixed spray bottle. I tried to stop the order but was notified the next day that it had been shipped. I returned it for credit. The good news is, my Chapin sprayer works great... ""You get what you pay for!"""
1,DOES NOT WORK!!!!!!!,"DO NOT waste your' money on this. Any roundup product sold by this misinformed company will not work. Also, you will do better to purchase locally. If you have a problem with the product you will have a better chance getting your money back! Rather than dealing from out of state. Never know what you might wind up with!!!!!"
1,No compre este reloj,"Este reloj es de mala calidad, muy bonito su acabado pero el mecanismo interno no sirve, todo el mundo lo comenta, lo compre en diciembre y desde que llego no funciona, tiene problemas con le mecanismo. es una estafa pues esta falla es bien conocida por Invicta, deberían recoger todos estos modelos."
1,Garbage,I should have payed more attention to the reviews. The negative ones are all true! I got this watch for my anniversary and in a month it started collecting condensation inside it. Luckily I was barely within the return time with Amazon. So I exchanged it for another. The second one kept getting caught on it's own hands until it stopped all together after 3 weeks. More research showed Invicta is a rip off to many. Invicta doesn't honor warranties and products are marked down 75% becasue that is their actual price. A good marketing scheme for a cheap watch.
2,Came defective,"I received the product without working properly,it had a mechanical problem with one needle. I sent to do a internal cleaning locally,and now its working."
1,It is not water resistant?!,"I bought this Invicta and the first time I went to a swimming pool all the water entered into the watch. I'm gonna submit images of the watch for you guys to see the water inside the crystal. This product shows '50 m water resistant' (165 Feet) but the pool has only 2 meters (6.5 Feet) deep!!! A complete disappointment, 80 dollars thrown down the drain!"
3,Case diameter,"One of the main reasons I got the watch was because the PRODUCT ESPECIFICATIONS said its case diameter is 42mm. Once I got the watch I realized its diameter is actually 38mm insted of 42mm, which makes the watch too small for what I like.Another important mistake in the watch is that they wrote ""IIII"" insted of ""IV"", how its supossed to be. Also, they should have rotated the ""VI"" so that you can see it as it should be seen."
3,Good price for a decent watch,"This is my first watch made by Invicta, I'm more of an Emporio Armani fan. I was attracted to this watch when it came up as an Amazon special at this great price. I've seen Invicta brand on TV and at high end stores but never really liked the large bulky sport style watches. This one is elegant and professional, the polished steel gives a very nice shine along the band. The weight is a little light and the face is a bit small not recommended for any big burly guys, but over all a nice watch for accenting a business suit. I would recommend it for the price I paid, under a $100 but I would rather spend over $400 on a different model watch that was a bit more hefty.Clasp is good and feels solid/secure.Face is clear to read the time.Weekday & dates are small, which is not uncommon so I wouldn't consider that a negative unless you have bad eyesight.Overall a decent watch for a great price."
4,very nice,"i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.he loves it -- as do i.so far, it seems to be keeping track of time nicely.we'll have to wait and see what the future has it store for us in regards to battery life and it's face."
2,The flame fusion crystal is not strong,"I bought this watch because of the crystal, but it's not good. It's like a mineral crystal. The flame fusion crystal is not strong. I'm disappointed because the watch has scratches and it is 1 year old. If you want it for the protection that you will have on the crystal, not buy this kind of watches. I have watches with sapphire crystal with more than 5 years and it doesn't have any scratches. I'm not comparing the kind of crystals, but the flame fusion crystal is not strong. It's sad because the watch is so nice."
4,Works with DVR4-Alert System,I couldn't get a straight answer from Swann but I ordered this anyway and it did work with my DVR4-Alert system (from Costco). It has an extra plug (for audio) which is not needed with that system and required a RCA -> BNC adapter to go to the DVR (or re-use the original cable = 180 ft total) but it worked.The package came with the cable and 2 RCA gender changes (female on both ends; connects two standard male plugs to extend).
4,extension cable,"The cable worked as it should with no problems for additional range of camera placement, all good."
4,Not compatible with the Night Hwak System,"This is a decent cable the quality is good. Be warned that the camera power cable is size ""H"". However the camera power unit is size ""M"". In other words slightly larger than the camera power able. I have 4 of these cables that are not compatible with my system. Does anyone know where I can get an adapter(s)?"
1,HANGING BY THE CABLE,"HI, EVERYONE I ORDERED A SWANN AV CABLE AND RECEIVED ANOTHER POWER CORD... I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I GOT... THE WAREHOUSESELLER TOLD ME IF MY TIME WAS SO PRECIOUS I COULD DO WHAT EVER I WANTED TO DO WITH IT. I COULD THINK OF A FEW THINGS... I MIGHT MAKE A TIRE SWING OR SOMETHING OUT OF IT. I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE SO SMART ABOUT IT. WHEN ORDERING THEY SHOULD STATE THAT YOU CANT RETURN WITHOUT A RETURN NUMBER AND YOU CANT GET THAT WITHOUT EMAILING THEM. THEN WAIT ON A RESPONCE, JUST HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WAIT. THEN PRINT A RETURN LABLE AND MAIL IT BACK. BUT IN MY CASE THEY DIDNT OFFER ME THIS OPTION. I WISH I HAD THAT SWING ABOUT NOW. THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND ME A REPLACEMENT CABLE IN THE MAIL. I HAVENT RECEIVED ONE YET. IM TIRED OF HANGING AROUND WAITING ON MY SWANN AV POWER CABLE. DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU JUMP IN AND ORDER LIKE I DID. OR YOU WILL BE HANGING AROUND WAITING ON YOUR CABLE LIKE ME. BRENDA HORTON HANGING BY THE CABLE."
4,the best among similar products,"the dictionary itself is ok, may be not as good as others, such as Pocket Oxford. But the execises, especially the Shooting Gallery, are excellent; and the Remind Pronunciation is very helpful both for learning pronunciation and incresing vocabulary."
3,Disappointing,"I would imagine that most of the autobiographies of sports personalities (and perhaps movie stars) in todays day and age are ghost-written. This book doesn't seem to be an exception.Being a great fan of Becker, I picked up the book as soon as I saw it in a bookshop. However, I was reasonably disappointed. The book talks very little about his tennis (which is what a fan would like to read about). I wanted to read about his epic matches, and his wimbledon wins.Instead of writing about tennis in this book, Becker writes more about the off-the-court aspects of his life (his misunderstandings with his coaches, with other players on the circuit). He seems to be making a point that he was never in the wrong but that he was misunderstood. The book seems to be his attempt to set the record straight."
4,Becker's side of the story.,"I found the book pretty interesting. I was a major Becker fan back in my teens & as such I've heard so many stories about him over the years. Problem was none of the stories involved his side or his view of the events. So I enjoyed learning about the events from the major player's point of view. He is a gentlemen about his relationships with women, including the mother of his daughter out of wedlock. I respect that, in today's ""Jerry Spring"" environment it would have been easy for him to get too personal or [...] to try & increase sales & he refrained from that. I hope Becker finds the happiness that seems to have eluded him all these years. (But if your looking for pictures the only ones in the book are on the front & back cover)Good book overall."
3,Nice read,This book is a good read. This is how an autobiography for a sportsperson should be written - AFTER he/she retires. Most people just write it in the middle of their careers and leaves the story ...well half finished. Boris does provide some honest insight into his life in this book more than his sport which is an interesting choice as one would expect sports to dominate most of the content. Every boom - boom fan should get hold of this one to get to know his life through his eyes first hand. Highly recommended.
5,ak47,great gun but too powerful for my son! Still waiting for RMA number to return. would have loved to keep it! It looks like a real one!
4,"for the most part, a good cd.","The title song is kind of aimless, not really going anywhere and taking its time getting there. You gotta love the flute playing, though, in it. I have no idea why I respect bands that play unorthodox instruments on a rock cd, but I do and I give them more leeway than I would other bands because of their originality. Last of the Singing Cowboys could easily be early Chicago singing it, but I like the horn section on it. What bugs me about that song is it is about a cowboy, but there is literally no country flavor to it. It's kind of a misnomer in that sense. Highlight of the album is Unto These Hills, just a really good southern rock song. It's not a bad cd by any stretch, but a perfect five star cd? I can't bring myself to do it. The weakness of Singing Cowboys and the title track is too much to overcome. Anyway, the rest of the cd is vintage Tucker band, and I really like it. Good cd, just not great."
5,"Buy This, now, please","This is one of the best albums I have heard of late. Resisting easy classification, N Crugu Bradului is doom inlaid on a black metal background. Don't believe earlier reviews, the craftsmanship of this record is some of the best to hit the metal scene, from composition to recording. I first heard this album about 6 months ago and I've been playing it multiple times a day since and it's only gotten better."
4,"Lovely, earthy guitar pop","The Grapes of Wrath are a sadly lamented Canadian group of the late 80's to early 90's. This is their second recording, and although it is not their best (1989's Now and Again and 1991's These Days both surpass it), it shows the band's talent for melodic, quality music. The standout track is ""Peace of Mind""; a rousing number that has one singing from start to finish. Anyone who likes Blue Rodeo, R.E.M., the Sundays and Oasis should give this a try."
5,Enchantment,"This is a beautiful collection of songs, a must-have for any diehard Final Fantasy fan...or anyone who loves wonderful songs. I'd give it 1,000,000 stars if I could."
5,Musical Masterpiece,"This collection of songs from the FF7 series follows a basic path, one taken by the player, so, in a way, it is arranged. It contains every piece of music found in the game. These are all remastered and sound better than those on the psx cds. But be warned!! The Turk's theme plays havoc on my cd player with anti-skip.This collection represents the vast spectrum of human moods, the carefree choco ranch theme, to the militaristic Rufus's theme, to the ever-so-sad Aeris's theme.All of these songs create their own environment, even without the game. They tell the FF7 story in their own respect, free from dialog or interruption.But I have to admit, nothing fills me with a source of power and terror over others than ""One Winged Angel""."
5,Nobuo Uematsu is a genius,"This soundtrack is worth every penny. Remember when you played through FF7 the first time? Remember how the music made you feel when you fought JENOVA after Sephiroth killed Aeris? The soudtrack will make you feel that way again. All of the songs from the game are in this 4-disk soundtrack. The songs are ordered by how you heard them in the game and the quality is so much better than what you heard in the game. If you liked the music from FF7, buy the soundtrack. It is worth the money."
3,I'm not quite sure what the big deal is...,"To be perfectly honest, I really only kinda liked this soundtrack. It is very good music, of this there is no doubt. But it just isn't good enough for (the price). Too much of the music is repeated from CD to CD and the songs are straight rips from the game itself. Had the producers put some effort in and added or enhanced more of the tracks, I would have been two stars happier."
3,This album is alright; not worth the money,"I expected this album to be blockbuster- it isn't. It just the same exact replicate songs straight from the game. No rearranged or revamped versions at all. Disc four is good with two songs that don't get old quick and that's song's no. 15 and 16, all the others get old very fast. Cid's theme, JENOVA are great the first time and even the second time over but not worth the money. I say pay for the orchastrated versions, theyre not synthed they have heart and are real classicals."
4,Mostly a Good Buy,"I had a previous model of the same CD/MP3 player and liked it. It lasted several years so I bought this one. The sound is good (nice bass), the headphones it comes with are good (although I use earbuds purchased elsewhere) and the price is reasonable. BUT, they redesigned this model from the previous one I had and put the battery compartment in a tough spot. The flipped-open cover gets in the way of your fingers as you try to pry the two double-A batteries from inside. But, it's manageable. They also redesigned the display which is harder to read than the one on the old model. All in all, worth the money though."
3,panasonic personal cd player,If you listen to audiobooks its good because it has book markingIt is very light weightOn the negative side the battery compartment door breaks eventually then the batteries come loose with every jog you do.
3,Not as bad as some of the reviews suggest!,"Apparently, from the other reviews, either you'll like it or you won't. I am in the middle of the road. I wished for more sparks between Maggie and JT- the romance was watered-down some. But the story was sweet. Maggie and JT go way back and because of family interference and misunderstandings they ended up with others and went through individual divorces - only to come back home to Springwater finding each other and renewing a relationship once again. Excitment is added with cattle poisoning, murder, and someone stalking Maggie. There are sub-characters that add a lot to the story as well. I suggest reading it but I don't know if I would recommend buying it. But it is a sweet read."
5,A fitting conclusion to the series,"I loved this book. It was a fast read as well as a great escape. Miller has given us the flavor of modern Springwater plus allowing the characters the chance to reverently appreciate the legacy of the early citizens who built the town.It is truly Maggie's and JT's story and if the problems of the people around them are not totally well developed, I feel that in no way does this take away from the romance of our two lovers.You feel the pain they suffered from losing each other so many years ago, feel the sadness as their first marriages ended and without doubt experience the unremitting joy as they rediscover their relationship.The arrival of JT's little boy only cements Maggie's and JT's feelings for one another. It also allows us to see briefly into the window of his past when his first wife brings Quinn to Montana.This will be a book to take to the beach, the pool or anywhere else you want to go and just be pleasantly entertained. A keeper."
2,FADE AWAY,"WITHIN 4 MONTHS OF THE ACTUAL USE OF THIS WATCH, THE GOLD PLATED CASE MATERIAL STARTED FADING. IT ALREADY LOOKS LIKE A 2 TONE(ROSE GOLD & SILVER) WATCH. THIS IS JUST SO UNACCEPTABLE FOR A WATCH OF THIS KIND."
3,Producto decente...,"El estilo y los colores son muy buenos,lo único es que las mangas son muy amplias (claro,tambien es cuestión de gustos) para el ancho de tronco y la tela es una mezcla de algodón con poliéster que es un poco calurosa...pero el precio no es tan alto..."
1,Buyer Beware,"Not recommended for persons who are: just become Christians; theological beginners.This compilation includes viewpoints supported by the founder of the HIGHLY DISCREDITED Jesus Seminar.Thus the ""a priori "" assumption is the contents will also be intellectually unfounded and dishonest and far afield from actual long-term studies and assessments.You read this at the risk of your own social, intellectual, and spiritual impairment."
3,Legends of Jazz drumming,I was courious of the history of jazz drumming and I really enjoyed watching and listening to this dvd. It takes you back in time and lets you know who some of the greats were.
1,Buyer Beware!!,"This is a simple little sheath, the quality is just OK... BUT... beware of this rip off store. They charged me $20 for shipping!!!!!!!!!! Total rip off. I did'nt even get ""expedited"" delivery. It arrived AFTER V'day.Sign me,Very P***ed off customer. Will never purchase from this store again."
2,not good,"I did not need tio but this but was lead to because of the ""frequently bought together"" lead. The knife came with a sheath and I did not need to buy another one but because of that I added one and did not need it."
1,Not like the Original,I purchased this to replace my Orignal Sheath that was worn. The one I received was of a cheaper material and the pocket was not cut the same as the original. It was hard to insert and remove and the flap would only close after I forcefully shoved my knife in the holder. I would look elsewhere for a replacement.
5,good product,Ordered this item for hubby as his was falling apart. Looked in local stores to find one so went online when no one had any. Was very easy to get the kind I needed. Hubby says he likes it very much. Seems like a well made product that will last awhile.
2,Could be better,"It seemed perfect: good looking guy, quirky girl, eccentric gang and even a ghost thrown in! but, somehow, it just wasnt a satisfying read. It had no bite too it. I know these are breezy books you pick up for escapism, but ... it could have been better. Sometimes you pick up a book and just laugh and laugh and laugh. this wasnt one of those books."
3,Interesting but erratic,"Within this book, you have some excellent and also really poor material.For instance, one chapter about estimating population growth is very good. It is objective. It details the assumptions, and explain why forecasting population growth is associated with a high level of uncertainty.Another chapter on the future of energy consumption is really bad. It is a not so disguised subjective infomercial about alternative energy. Although promoting the use of alternative energy is really laudable, it should not be confused with objective and integer forecasting simulation. This one chapter should have never made it within this book in its existing form."
2,Needs an editor,"This is really a shockingly poorly written book. There are grammar errors throughout, and it is stylistically uneven. The writer will randomly jump time perspectives (mentioning where one person is today, but not another). It's a fascinating story, but the writer was not up to the task."
3,"Having grown up in Kirtland, Ohio","I thought the book was very well written but I will agree it was a little slow getting into it. I lived 2 streets over from the ""infamous"" barn and pass by it all the time. Having read the book was a little odd at first because they would talk about something in Kirtland and I would know exactly what they were talking about. It's a good read but you can tell it was written from the prosecuter's side. If you want something factual, you would be better off reading about it online."
2,Needs a rewrite.,"This is a book with "" way too much meat"" in a sandwich bag.It is informative but the paragraphs have so many descriptions of so many people it's hard to keep "" who's who straight"".And it was all written in the past tense with not much real action or suspense. ( You know what's going to happen..and after you figure out who's going to do the killing...why should one keep reading?)I would like to tell the author ...You have a very good story to tell... it should be read by more people....I know you are enthusiastic about the subject. Just slow down and go back and rewrite this book. I'm sure then you'll have a BEST SELLER.Tanya Radic"
1,Don't waste your time or money.,This book is disgusting. There are a few facts in there but it's so slow going it gets to the point where you figure out where they're headed five chapters before they get there. The authors need to figure out that this personal vendetta against this religion or cult or whatever just makes them look pathetic. Don't waste any effort on this sewage.
5,Compelling from beginning to end!,I loved Swordpoint! The characters had depth and some even mysterious. The writing flowed nicely and the story sucks you up instantly. The plot twist are unexpected and craftily planned. A great novel.
4,Not Free SF Reader,"I suppose Swordspoint is supposed to be a fantasy, but the fantasy is pretty much just the 'different setting'.Here, a professional swordsman and duellist gets a bit more involved in the politics and machinations of the place than he would like, and has to try and keep both himself and his lover safe while doing the right thing."
2,Boring,"The other one star posters said the same thing. Nothing interesting about the plot or the characters, and certainly the swordfights were not impressivel Mediocre book. Can't even remember who the characters are and what happened. I listened to the audio book which had annoying background noise (like a typewriter typing in the background), and the story just droned on and on. No humor, cleverness, surprise. How it got so many good ratings is beyond me. What an incredible waste of money and time. Just blah."
3,Second look years later,"I read this book years ago when it first came out. I re-read it recently after I read ""Privilege"". I remember that I liked it more the first time. Perhaps attractive, angry young male sociopaths aren't interesting to me anymore.Kushner does write beautifully. The world she is writing about is complex and interesting. Unfortunately, I didn't like most of the characters."
2,I just couldn't like it,"I really tried to like this book. I even went back to re-read some of the few interesting parts. The characters were blant and the story was boring. This was not a book that urged me to keep on readng (it took me a long time, with frequent pauses, to get through this). On the plus side, the writing style was fluent."
2,Unreadable,"So many people had recommended this to me, but I just couldn't finish this book. All the characters are written to be horrible people, full of smug satisfaction in their own horribleness. It is technically well written and maybe things work themselves out later in the book, but I gave up after the first few chapters."
3,entertaining fluff,"This isn't a very good book. But many things, i suppose, can be forgiven as long as they are interesting.Swordspoint is an nearly-dreadful story about young, attractive, wealthy, well-dressed, horrible people scheming, conniving, blackmailing and intriguing; all the while giving fabulous parties and drinking hot coacoa. yeek. well, almost. at first i wasn't quite sure i was supposed to be rooting for anybody -- every character seemed incredibly unpleasant. but i eventually grew attached to a few of them, and i imagine that's what made this read worthwhile -- it certainly wasn't the writing! awful, misplaced, hackneyed metaphors abound. and the sex scenes.. don't get me started. it's like reading a really bad romance novel.overall, though, it was pleasant enough. if you're interested in reading a *good* fantasy/sf novel dealing with intrigue and politics, though, i'd reccommend something by Valerie Freireich in her ""Polite Harmony of Worlds"" universe."
1,Third time is the charm,"Well, I have written two reviews on this book and none were posted. So for this one I will just point out quickly that this is an awful book. Not a fantasy book at all, more like a Harliquin romance book with boring action and bland characters.Oh and all the men in the story bat for both teams, graphically to I might add. If that's not your type of book, don't get this one. I returned my copy for the first time ever."
2,Good Writing . . . Bad Love Life,"Lable me naive, but when I picked up this book I did not know that it featured a gay couple. Lable me politically incorrect as well, but I have to admit that this was uncomfortable for me as I was half way through the book before I relized the two main charactors (Richard and Alec) were a couple and I had already come to care about what happened to their charactors. Kushner has a great warm style, and I'd love to read any book of her's. About a HETEROSEXUAL person, thank you very much (you know guy+girl instead of, well, guy+guy). The plot was good and the story was interesting, but I just couldn't get past their sexual orientation:( Maybe this won't be a problem for some people, but I personaly couldn't enjoy it."
4,"""Everyone lives at Swordspoint.""","In Riverside a famous Swordsman named Richard St Vier lives and dies by the sword. He and his lover Alec go all around Riverside. Alec tries to get himself killed by somebody better than him and St Vier kills the men for him.When Richard St Vier is blackmailed he knows what he must do:""A swordsman can't afford to be blackmailed.""Richard is accused of murder now and he doesn't know if he'll live or die. It's a matter of honor to what he did to a noble but will the court believe that? Will they understand the twists and turns that even Richard doesn't understand? Let's hope that Alec will come to save the day... Will he?I would like to congratulate Ms. Kushner on a wonderful book! Some people said this book was slow. It's true that in some points of the story you may feel like you're getting absolutely nowhere but I assure you that it'll pass and you'll enjoy this book a lot. And remember: ""Everyone lives at Swordspoint."""
4,Fires Of Merlin,In this epic tale about a wizard named Merlin he has to make an instrument that will increase his power but during the process which he has only one chance in his whole life. Urnalda the elf queen comes and seeks his assistance. There is a dragon in the lands named Valdearg who rage is endless. The reason why he is angry is because someone killed his offspring and he thinks it's the elfs because the elf land is nearest to the dragon's lair. Will Merlin succeed in facing the dragon? Even if the prophecy says that two of them will die! You have to read this great book to find out.
5,"The Fires of Merlin was my Homework ,","""The Fires of Merlin"" was about the great adventures that Merlin had when he was a kid. This book was the third of five books in the Lost Years of Merlin series. This book deals with Merlin losing his power. He had to confront an evil dragon that his grandfather had put into a deep slumber. To add to all this, there were ancient bat-looking creatures that stole magic. They were supposedly extinct. There was an evil group on the island that wanted to destroy all magic. The evil group started to raise the bat-like creatures. The group and their bats were responsible for what happens to Merlin's powerful necklace. If you want to find out what happens to Merlin and if he finds his power read the book yourself."
4,"Dragons, and Kreelixes, and Deer...oh my!","This is the third installment in Merlin's early adventures--he's fourteen years old in this one, and his wizarding skills are sorely challenged and threatened in this adventure. The long sleeping dragon has been awakened and threatens Fincayra, and a magic-anihilating cult has reappeared--their goal to wipe out magic wherever it appears on the island. The stage is set for another epic struggle of good versus evil, and it's frequently tough to distinguish which is which.This is a fun fantasy read that speeds by too quickly."
1,Just big enough for a rice crispies treat,Way too too small. I bought for my daughter who goes to school overseas. Not big enough to carry anything. We will use for picnics.
1,form over function,"it looks good and coordinates nicely with the matching toilet brush, but when push came to plunge it was useless. the rubber wouldn't flex and I got no satisfaction. adding insult to injury, the end of the handle was uncomfortable to try to push down with. of course that might not have mattered if the business end was flexible enough to work.luckily I had an Oxo plunger in another bathroom. I prefer the looks of the Oggi, but the Oxo just plain works."
4,"Quick, fascinating read","I enjoyed the history and the relationships of the people involved. When you are able to see inside the hardships of the families, explorers and greed of mankind, it makes you realize how some things never change. It also showed a side of support and friendship that we would all hope to encounter in our lives."
4,Ada BlackJack: A True Story of Survival in the Arctic,"If you like reading stories about arctic and south pole exploration, (ie: Shackleton) this a good one. Its nice to read about a worman's experience about her survival and the aftermath of her rescue."
3,A great tale just a little too long,"I loved Ada Blackjack. The book is like two books, the before and after. The before kept me turning pages, and I could not get enough of the ice, cold, and desparation. This woman was complex and simple. She was a fascinating character study but as I entered the second part of the book I was let down with too much detail of people I really did not get to know like I knew Ada. Either way it is a wonderful adventure."
3,"High drama, tedious read","Author Jennifer Niven discovered a truly remarkable and sadly under-reported tale when she stumbled on references to Ada BlackJack in the course of her previous writing work. It is to her credit that she recognized the importance of the story and did the work necessary to bring the saga to light. As other reviewers have long since noted, this is the history of an ill-fated expedition to Wrangell Island in which four young white men failed to succeed leaving their hired seamstress, an Inuit woman with no wilderness experience whatsoever, and expedition cat as the only survivors. The story is gripping. The telling? Not so much. While the question of the fate of the participants in the ill-conceived venture draws one on to finish reading the story, the inclusion of too much verbatim material from letters and diaries drags the whole thing down. A book half as long would have served readers better."
3,Story telling,It was okay reading based on a true event. For some reason I didn't care fot the author's writing style
2,eh.,"After reading the Ice Master I was hooked and wanted more so I purchased Ada BlackJack: A True Story of Survival in the Arctic. I bought the book looking for an arctic adventure complete with a female lead, what I got was life histories on a group of people that lacked common sense, courage, and decency."
4,ada blacjack,The story itself is great. The authors historical comments take away from the good part. How true a woman's strength!
3,Interesting story of Eskimo woman's fight for survival,I picked up this book knowing nothing about the artic expedition to Wrangel Island. I found the story initially quite fascinating but that the book really bogged down when the author insisted on including the contents of every letter that the survivors families wrote over the next ten years. I feel that the book could have been much shorter and still powerfully portrayed the struggles of Ada and her companions to survive Wrangel Island.
3,Disappointing selection,"There are many wonderful BTR tracks on this record, but there are also many questionable inclusions. Not the best, there must be a better collection than this one."
3,You get what you pay for,"The opening on the vice is only 4.5 inches as specified. I missed this. I was expecting at least 6-7"". The handles are rather difficult to turn after they are half way extended. The installation instructions are extremely sparse, but most of it is logical. It will probably be more of a horse than a workbench for me. I think the B&D 225 would have been a much better choice."
5,Rock Your Socks Off!!!,"This CD is so good & complete it's not even funny. I don't know where the first reviewer gets off giving this a poor review. From start to finish this CD is absolutely superb. Unlike most other dance albums out there, the CD isn't filled with a bunch of filler garbage, pure quality music from start to finish. There are few other albums out there as superb. Other albums I'd compare this one to are ""Steve Porter - Home Grown"", ""Miika Kuisma - Inwardgaze"", & ""Soulwax - Nite Versions"". Although the sounds for all these albums differ, the quality is the same on all. Check out this album & you won't be disapointed."
4,Wonderful fast reference...,"Quick measures to assert control over a difficult illness, it is concise and plainly written--this is immeasureably valueble to people suffering CFS and the often common mental fog that accompanies pain and fatigue. Has concise information bits from leading clinicians who work with sick patients, NOT test tubes!"
5,Kathi Keville really knows her stuff!,"I have several of Kathi's books, but this one is most helpful. As a chef, I am on my feet alot. fatigue is something I am very familar with. I was a childhood friend of the author and would love to e-mail her. Is there a web site or address?"
1,dont know,I am in the same boat when it comes to a new cd from my man keith-let us have a couple samples because the old school is mixing with the new and I cant get with beanie man or xhibit.Keith hopefully stays true to what made him the best lovemaking songs you can find.I will buy it because its Keith.
5,THIS IS THE GRATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you like mice or anything small you will love this book. If you read Time Stops for No Mouse it is related to this book. A new chipmunks arrives.The things that are intresting about him is he has a missing ear and a rusty-colored cordury jacket. He is so intrested in cats that he wants to find a library. I am not going to spoil the adventure for you. So the only thing i have to say to you is READ IT.
5,A really REALLY great sequel!!!,"First of all, Time Stops for No Mouse was a great book. As a HUGE fan of Redwall and Stuart Little type books, I knew that it was at least going to be good. But I was really surprised. It turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read. Then, Michael Hoeye returned Hermux and all his friends back in a sequel, The Sands of Time, that (I think) was even better than the first. You will see the return of a lot of your favorite chracters like Hermux, Mirrin, Tucka, and Linka, and plus a cast of entirely new chracters. I dont want to spoil the book, but I can say that you will be taken on a fantastic journey, as three friends try to uncover the past!!"
5,fun to read aloud,"Laughed so much reading the first Tantamoq book that I started reading parts to my family--then we all realized this author reads better out loud anyway. Ordered the whole series from Amazon, but unfortunately they seem to be sold out of the 3rd in the series (another printing? hint hint). May have to go on to the 4th skipping the 3rd."
3,"Take away the vocals, and you've got a guitar classic . . .","On this album, I promise you'll find a great ammount of excellent guitar playing, especially on tracks such as ""Wingless"". But, mostly because of Focus' decision to work with Mr. Proby, the vocals on this album tend to get on my nerves. I feel that they sound false; laden with Las Vegas Casino-sounding cheese. I feel that at this point in their careers, Focus had lost most of their all-round weirdness that was so evident back in the ""Hocus Pocus"" days. But because of the great instrumentation, I still feel that this album is worth a listen."
5,Enchanting. A great adventure book with boys AND girls,"I was introduced to Swallows & Amazons by my father more than 30 years ago, so I approached the series with some trepidation when my 6 year old demanded ""boat stuff"" to be read to her, afraid that S&A might not have aged well. I shouldn't have worried, Clare is totally enthralled with the books (we are on number 5 & the enthusiasm shows no signs of waning). While some children may find reading to themselves too much until they are 9 or 10, Clare at 6 has no problem following the plots, identifying with the characters, and generally having a good time. I might add that it is also nice having some great female heroine/role models plus some nice male types as well. I recommend the series without reservation"
5,Best Arctic Adventure since Shackleton,"The novelist and bookish scientist round out the cast of pirates and adventurers. Any child will find herself playing one of these remarkable friends, and requiring her parents to say ""ay-aye, sir"". (A grown-up, of course will identify with and emulate Captain Flint, or one of the other natives.)My 4+ year-old (Mate Susan) will not tolerate other bedtime stories; unfortunately I cannot put it down, and always read a few chapters ahead after she is asleep. This ruins the suspense for me the next night..."
3,Sixties again,James Last continues to be one of my favourite musicians but I can't say that this one of my favourite albums. The tracks are well layed down and musically very smooth but this is a choice of some of the more ordinary music from the sixties with only a few exceptions. I found the sixties a time where some magnificent music was written but not a lot of it is represented here.
3,good memories,I was hoping it was his original tracks not new recordings. Still good but not as good as the original tracks.
1,NEVER GOT IT,I NEVER GOT IT. I NEVER GOT IT. I am getting mad. What else can I say? Now what happens. I do not know what to do now.//
4,Tantilizing,"I really enjoyed this book because it is a glimpse into the mind of a latina female officer, from her perspective. This is what the public doesnt see behind the badge.Validating if your one too."
5,Great movie!!,A handsome hitchhiker(John Derek) is picked up by a beautiful woman(Ursula Andress)and the hitchhiker framed for murder after the woman's husband brutally murders her.This superb 1965 film has a great cast that includes Sammy Davis Jr. and Robert Duvall.Check it out!!
3,"great value canister vacuum, but...","this vacuum is quite versatile and convient for around the house and garage type chores, works quite well, and reasonably priced too. but good luck finding the overpriced dry filter bags for this one. shop vacs own site barely acknowledges its existance and even knowing that you need catalog number 919-64-00 is of little help. no one carries the bags or filters locally, even in a relatively large metro area like Denver. Indeed you can go without the filter bag, but its quite messy as others have mentioned. At Shop Vacs own site 2 packs of bags (four total) with the cheapest shipping will set you back$27.00!"
4,Finally Timed Out,"We've had this puppy for longer than we can remember. I think the switch just failed today. Nice, long cord and hose, and pretty stable. Our only complaint is the angled wand has frozen recently and just won't release, and that's made it very difficult to unclog the hose when that was necessary. Otherwise, it's a fiver, and we may order another one. Sure hope they haven't cheapened them over the years as happens with so many products."
1,doesn't have much power I would sent it back if it didn't cost so much keep your money,this vac is easy to use but the filter stinks and it doen't have any power would return it but would have to pay to do that so guess i am out 80 dollars. I had one that had less hp it was 2 time more powerful I hate it and really hate that with amazon you can't really return unless you want to be out a arm and a leg. Won't buy anything of much value from them again
1,Shipping rip off,"I have to agree withe the comments regarding the bags, and how much they cost to ship. Shipping is almost as much as the cost of the bags. Shop-Vac doesn't seem to realize how great this vacuum is. All the others they make tip over. This one actually stays upright, and it's powerful as well. If you use this vacuum a lot you'll be spending more than the price of the vacuum every two months on the cost of the bags and shipping! How expensive can it be to manufacture a bag, and why does it cost so much to ship?"
4,Good Vac.,Good vac. The vac does the job we bought it for. Could not find a hepa filter for this unit.
3,Good vac but bags will bunkrupt you.,"I have this vac for a few years now, and it's very dependable, easy to use, and will last and last. I'd rate it 5, but...Cons:1 - bags are impossible to find. nobody carry them or even 4 gallon size in general. to buy online will bankrupt you as shop vac running nice little racket, selling those 6 cent cost items for $6 to 12 per bag. The costs of replacement bags will very quickly overrun the cost of vac.What I ended up doing is buying next bigger size bags of whatever cheapest brand local store carry(5-8 gallons), just making sure they are similar in shape and look. they always fit and work nicely, you just have to bend it a little along the bottom so it fits into the vac. That'll run you about $2 a bag or less if find a deal.2 - there is no good nozzle to efficiently vacuum garage floor or any concrete floor, like basement."
4,shop vac,"I bought this same vacuum about 10 years ago and have loved what a workhorse it is. The motor in mine finally died and I was afraid I wouldn't find another just like it - but I did and I love it! The only problem with the old one AND the new one - the head that you use on the floor has two positions - one is brushless and the other position has a brush. For some reason - the brush mode never stays in place and you are basically forced to use the brushless mode unless you feel like putting it back every 4 seconds! Other than that, I am thrilled to have this shop vac again!"
3,Not Enough Power,"I have over 2000 s/f of uneven slate tile flooring and have a professional floor scrubber that only depenses water, no pick up, so I bought this to suck up mop water, ""not"" enough suction. I'll find another use for it,but hope this review helps someone else make a decision."
2,"Motor burned out, only used for vacuuming car.","Disclosure: I did not buy from Amazon. I bought from a local big box store in Oregon.With one or two exceptions, I only used this vacuum to clean our cars out. It last a little over a year before the motor burned out.Pros: smaller size (nice for apartments, townhouses, small homes). I like the small size since I have limited garage/storage space. The suction was ok, when it worked. Lots of attachments.Cons: Motor burned out. Unacceptable. Even worse, now this vacuum will sit forever in a landfill, horrible.I don't recommend. I replaced it with another brand that may or may not be better."
1,Died suddenly!,"I have one of these E87 series vacuums as shown and have used it infrequently forabout five years. Bags are expensive but I found a site online where they were halfwayreasonable in price and bought a bunch. It has been a very useful vacuum overall andI would have given it a four star rating but it suddenly died today! No warning, justdied shortly after startup. This is NOT acceptable! It the first vacuum I've EVER hadthat just quit working. No fuse is shown in the diagram so who knows what may be wrong?"
4,Unfinished Album?,"I've read through the previous reviews and conclude that this album was really not finished. If you listen to some of the songs, then you might realize that more work would be needed to complete the songs. However, I look at the bright side of this: I'll treat this as the kind of material you would get from a box set. Songs you have never heard of before that may have had the potential to be hits. Thus, I do recommend this to all Carpenters' fans."
4,realy speaks truth in the heart...,i havent herd all there albums but this one an there christmas one realy does voice to your heart ...look to your dreams i like allot because its very hopefull an truthfull and superiotious as maybe one of the stooges would say and at the end of a song ...your enough is what all married people should say to each other so i could go on an on but no red type so an no extra time ...all for now rules an regulations SHDFH...
3,Good but very sad,"This CD has some lovely songs, like ""Sailing On The Tide"", ""Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore"" and ""Two Lives"". I could've done without all the choir parts, and I agree that Karen's solo version of ""Make Believe It's Your First Time"" is superior to the overproduced one on this CD.I DARE any Carpenters' fan who is hearing ""Now"" for the first time not to cry. I still get choked up when I hear it. We miss you Karen!"
2,The Posthumous Tribute,"Just after Karen's death, Richard went back to the studio to record another album, featuring tunes that didn't make previous albums. While a touching album, it really is just a compilation of ""outtakes."" The first song ""Now"" is clearly the best, but there are other good parts to the album also. ""Make Believe it's Your First Time"" became a Top Ten Adult Contemporary hit in 1983, but the version on Karen's solo album seems to be better. ""Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore"" is another highlight, reminiscent of ""Hurting Each Other"", but it never broke the Hot 100. ""Look to Your Dreams"" is a fitting closing, but overall, this album is a combo of some of the group's less than stellar material."
5,One of the Greatest Voices Ever,"I ordered this CD after reading Randy Schmidt's LITTLE GIRL BLUE. Even at the end of her life, after years of dealing withanorexia nervosa, and ultimately not successfully, Karen Carpenter could still sing like no one else I have ever heard."
3,Mixed,"This is a tough album... The highlights are AWESOME -- Ordinary Fool is the best thing they've ever done... But several of the songs are just plain BAD... Two Lives, At the End of a Song & Prime Time Love are just awful!!! I could write better songs. Very unfortunate, this could have been a 5 star CD with a few more good songs."
4,Karen's true farewell album,"Getting the CD of Voice of the Heart had been on my wish list for quite a while & I just purchased it today. It's nice to see that Voice is now readily available in CD format. ""Now"" is truly a wonderful, warm song...any Carpenters fan should get a chill from it. But, that song, as well as ""Ordinary Fool"" are available on the 4-CD set. The real gems, found only on this CD are ""Your Baby Doesn't Love..."" and the haunting and wistful ""Look to Your Dreams"". That's why the album is a win! Enjoy"
4,This is a great CD,"Ignore those negative reviews. This disc stands up well compared to any other Carpenters ""offering"". Thank you Richard for the honor of being able to listen to more of your music. Just listen to the samples! Start to finish, what beautiful music."
4,"So, so sad","I agree with a reviewer below, that this is just a compilation of previously unreleased tracks. Richard Carpenter and A&M Records never should have hailed ""Voice of the Heart"" as the final Carpenters album, considering this fact. I also agree with so many others as this being regarded as the ""funeral"" album. I was a fan of The Carpenters and this posthumous release only served as a reminder of the great loss everyone was feeling at the time. However, there are many lovely recordings such as ""Ordinary Fool,"" ""At the End of a Song"" and ""Now."" ""You're Enough"" is the only song I bag on, in which the intro always reminds me of a bunch of circus clowns and elephants for some reason. I love ""Sailing On the Tide"" which is the only upbeat song on the whole album. I could have done without the ""fogie"" chorus singers on some of the album's best tracks. This is The Carpenters and if you were a fan, you should add this to your collection. But be prepared to get very, very sad."
5,Karen's Last gift to us,"Her final tracks are here...Now, Your Enough, At the End of the Song...beautiful. Now is a masterpiece. Karen sings each word, each phrase as if it holds a special meaning to her. It was the last track she ever recorded, making it that much more meaningful to us."
5,Another Gem,"Funny how we look around for entertainment. How I found this set(s) or why is a mystery. Perhaps to find a song that I once loved and wanted to hear again. Can't tell you how many copies I have of Tainted Love. What I crave from CD's such as this one is that long lost song. You know..... the one you heard only for a second or a minute; a note, a word, a statement. I have found them in this set and the like. Not the top-40 stuff from the US radio. Not the little snippets. Nice to have the full length again. Tracks that you knew and danced to. Music the rest of the world knows and loves. As said, if I find one track thats new (to me) or perhaps I loved from one listen here; well worth the price ten fold. Remember, it was the 80's, no XM Radio or One Word Search. One once waited to hear the title or if lucky on MTV with the info. Still learning about the good stuff I missed! Some here and others are duds. Do buy if you know and love the 80's."
3,"12""/80s mix",I am having something of a 80's revival which has been influenced by my 20 years school union recently.Having recently bought the Omigod 80's box set I was on the look out for something further and stumbled on this.This is a cd that grows on you with repeated listens and and remins you of the early days of techno as these artist try and extend their creativity. The first two discs of this three disc set are well presented and mix seamlessly togther. Stand out tracks in this collection include Talk Talk's Its my life and Visage's fade to gey.If only I can grow my mullet again I will truly feel back in the 80's.
1,Tired,"As if anyone really cares about the Corp, and that includes the new breed of Aggies. It's a tired tradition of a bunch of military wannabe's that couldn't get into U of Texas. Come on...no one other than Aggies will buy this book, just another constant reminder to Aggies that since they got a second rate education they can fall back on school pride. While you Whoop and Holler....the rest of the world says ""WHO CARES""."
2,Not nice as the pics shown in the site.,Built material looks cheap in the real life. Material is not flexible also.
1,USELESS,I saw the registered price and thought it is on Sale.The registered price was more than $150 and this product was for $25 . I bought it to find that the comforter Set I got was no way near to the one which they sell for 200 or 150. Its laying in my basement. Useless.
3,Good at this price,"I guess, its good for this price. Its nice and comfortable but does't really do any good against cold."
2,You get what u Pay for,No way is this set worth the money they said. The boarders on the shams arent evenfilled--i agree with others that the quilt is too short. For the price--what the heck--it pretty enough---i guess
2,Value??,"This set certainly doesn't look like a $250 one. The comforter is too short (vertically) to reach from the headboard to the bottom of the mattress at the foot of the bed. It lacks about 6"" being long enough. If I had been able to see it on the bed first, I would not have purchased it."
2,"Malibu Shores Multi Tropical 4 Piece Jacquard Comforter Set, King","Diappointed with the quality. It dose'nt look the same way it does in the picture when you open the package. The actual retail price is way overpriced.. But, for 30 bucks you cant complain."
2,The suggested retail value is way off.,"This comforter does not have the quality. It was flat with very little padding. I read the reviews prior to purchasing. And what I expected was an inexpensive comforter for the guest bedroom. That is what I got. If you want a descent set for the price, its ok."
1,I do NOT recommend this at all,"First and foremost....it doesnt feel like a $250 stuff.Moreover, its Queen size doesnt fit to queen bed!! NOT even worth 30 bucks. I am disappointed!"
5,Excellent - Must Have !,More and more books are addressing the problems ASD kids encounter in their latter years . Teresa Bolick has written a well thought out and structured book that answers many of the concerns that parents and teachers have. Would you need another book dealing with this area ? I would say...yes. It is such an important time in these kids lives that a comprehensive knowledge is needed by all those that care for these yound adults.reviewed by Special Education Teacher and father of ASD child.
5,Bird bath,"Easy to assemble, with a heavy base to keep it upright. Bowl is cast aluminum which makes it lightweight. Only complaint is that bowl gets very hot in full sun, unlike concrete bowls. I don't know what effect, if any, this may have on the birds, but the water gets quite warm."
4,Clever and Intriguing,"I throughly enjoyed reading ""Need"". This was my first time running across Lawrence David. He is a gripping author, who makes you relate if you like it or not. I recommend this novel to anyone looking for a work worth the time. I don't think you'll be dissapointed."
3,interesting plotline bogged doen by excessive detail,"an interesting plotline that is bogged down by an obsessive-compulsive use of detailed description. For instance, the author went into agonizing detail about a flashing vcr clock. I wanted to scream at the author: ""get on with the story!"" This book would be a great tool for an English teacher to use to use to teach students to embellish their writing.Furthermore, about halfway through the book, I began to lose sympathy for and interest in the ""three blind mice"""
3,"A compelling tale, if heavy handed","Surprisingly, for its flaws, I read this book in basically one sitting. The author, a survivor (remarkably) of the horrific collision of two 747s on the island of Tenerife, tells his story and others in this book. He adds just the right amount of back story to put you in emotional touch with the individuals on the planes.The only drawback is the tendency to repeat himself from chapter to chapter. That, and if you're put off by someone's testimony about their religion, then this book isn't for you. The author weaves the story around his own Christianity and how he believes his faith led to his survival. However, he also addresses the questions (at least, according to his beliefs) of where G-d is when disasters like these take place.All in all, it was certainly enough to keep my attention and put it in my library. A very unusual perspective, to say the least."
5,As beautiful as a pile of mutant sludge can be.,"Hedorah's detail is fantastic. The only moving parts are his arms, but due to his design it's forgivable. Most Godzilla toys aren't educational, but I'll toss Hedorah a few stars for the environmental message (in the movie he appeared in, Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster, Hedorah fed off pollution)."
3,True to Movie,Not a complicated toy. An action figure which is durable and semi-poseable. If you like Godzilla movies this is a nice addition to any collection of monster memorabilia.
2,Not upto Croscill standard of quality,All of Croscill sheets are a very low thread count and quite stiff. I honestly would not recommend spending the money on these sheets. If you do own Croscill sheets you will know the only way to soften them is to wash 10+ times with lots of softener.I would suggest people spend their money on higher thread count and preferably Eygptian cotton sheets. White/Brown/Maroon/Yellow all look great with this Sienna Stripe pattern.
5,Pure uplifting energy....!,"This is the second volume to Blank & Jones ""The Mix"" compilation series, and is no doubt guarenteed to uplift and revitalize every aspect of your heart, of your soul to another lever, a higher state of consciousness..! I was trying to get a hold of the limited edition 3-CD set, which includes a bonus third disc, of ambient chilled grooves, but unfortunately it was indeed ""limited"" and out of stock from all vendors, which I had been searching...however, I still am very happy and pleased to the fullest with just the 2-Cd compilation....Bravo!"
5,cd,gloria estefan has a beautiful voice and the music is wonderful. I enjoy all the songs and I definitely recommend this cd.
3,Doesn't Lather Well,"Doesn't lather well, leaves hair dry (unless conditioner is used afterwards), but still leaves hair drier than most other $5 moisturizing shampoos.However, it makes hair feel very light-weight afterwards, and smells great."
4,Plantar fasciitis better but not gone.,"I bought these in hopes of ridding myself of chronic heel pain, going on 1 year now. I had used Tuli's heel cups in the past and was better within a short time. I am sure that I am at fault for not getting well, I waited much too long to deal with my heel problem. I had tried other heel pads and Tuli's by far are much better than anything others that I tried. Overall, am pleased with heel cups."
4,"A good ""missing link"" CD...","I absolutely love the first CD by Human Clay (Marcel Jacob & Jeff Scott Soto). This one for whatever reason seems under-produced, and not quite to the (very high) standard set by the other. I call it a ""missing link"" as I had some difficulty even finding this disc. For fans of JSS and his wide ranging career, you just have to have it."
2,It's not what I thought I bought!,"Bought this item by the name thinking it was something else entirely! When I got the item I was little shocked on how it looked but also giddy to try it out. After trying multiple times to try and get this toy to ""work"", some which hurt very badly, I gave up and looked only how to work it and found out it was a musical instrument! AN INSTRUMENT?! WHY WOULD YOU NAME AN INSTRUMENT A VIBRASLAP AND NOT EXPECT PEOPLE TO JAM IT UP THERE!gave one star since it works well as a musical instrument."
3,Brush Up on Grammar and Mexican History,This little book puts you in touch with Spanish literature in an interesting but simple way. Its good as a learning or re-learning experience.
5,Good First Reader,"Nicely passed for a beginning Spanish reader. Not too difficult, but it keeps you interested and learning. Just enough new vocabulary in each story."
2,Incorrect grammar!!!,"This book is often missing the correct usage of the third person indirect object pronouns ""le"" and ""les"". There are several instances in which its says ""dar a alguien"" where it should be ""darle a alguien"". This is very bad because I started using it with my students when they began to learn these pronouns. They noticed right away that they were missing.p. 90: ""entonces dijo a sus soldados"" should be ""entonces LES dijo a sus soldados""p. 90: ""y pronto estos ofrecieron su ayuda a Cortes"" should be ""y pronto estos LE ofrecieron su ayuda a Cortes"".p. 78: ""La directora inicia la ceremonia y habla a los presentes"" should be ""la directora inicia la ceremonia y LES habla a los presentes"".p. 78: ""Despues la directora entrega los diplomas a cada uno de los alumnos"" should be "" Despues la directora LEs entrega los diplomas a cada uno de los alumnos.""They're all over the place."
3,CD-ROM lacks Section 2,"This is a very good text for learning Spanish. Lessons are easy and take an hour or less. Answers are in the back. It is identical to the previous edition, but adds a CD-ROM. The CD-ROM gives text in type and voice. However it lacks Section 2 of 3. Disappointed in omission. (Perhaps Section 2 is just Tardy.) It would be nice if it linked with other books-- a verb workbook, a vocabulary book--but there are no indications that it does."
5,Good practice for beginners,"I've been listening to the Pemsleur Spanish lessons for a couple months now and I wanted some reading practice that would fit my level. This book worked perfectly. In the beginning all of the verbs are present tense which matches well with the beginning of most Spanish courses. I haven't listened to the CD yet since I was more interested in reading but I think they will come in handy, too."
5,Easy Spanish Reader,A great book for beginning Spanish learners. Limited vocabulary helps the learner to build syntax skills. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning Spanish or brushing up on rusty skills.
5,Live Like you were Dying: A Story about Living,I loved this book! It was so good! The book was just as powerful as the song. It makes you realize what you have and you should not take advantage of it.
2,Loved the Song - Hated the Book,"I tried reading this book over a dozen times and could not get pass the first 10 pages. This was a selection in my book club and none of the members liked the book either. In fact we did not even bother discussing the book. I love other books written by Michael Morris, but this one was just too sappy to make it worth reading."
3,"Good optics, terrible focusing mechanism","Optics are surprisingly good and software works OK on PC. But the stage mechanism is cheap plastic, and impossible to use smoothly, especially at higher magnifications. I'll spend a few bucks more next time for a better unit."
1,Mac users watch out!!!,"Nowhere in the technical info about this product does it explain that the software one must install works ONLY with PCs, not Apple computers! When I received mine as a gift, I made this unpleasant discovery and tried to contact Digital Blue's support line. In spite of their claim that ""excellent customer service"" is a high priority for them, all I could get was a machine recording. There is a link on their web site that says it can take you to a site to get the necessary Mac software, but, guess what, the link doesn't work. I emailed them and got a brief note with a reference to another company that could presumably provide the software needed, but they pointed out that Digital Blue does not provide any support for that software. Catch 22. All in all, I personally feel that it was a mistake to buy this product."
4,A very science nice toy,"I bought this for my son's 7th birthday. He enjoys it very much. We found all sorts of interesting things to look at around the house and discuss.Overall, it is a VERY good toy.My main problems with it are:1. Lightling is from a single direction, so its not uniform.2. The resolution of the camera is OK, but not great."
5,Fantastic!!,"My son got this for his birthday and absolutely loved it. Immediately he was making movies and magnifying everything. He loves that it comes off the base to magnify just about anything that he can get close to the computer. He asked me if he could take it to school and share it with his class. His teacher loved that they could all gather around the computer and look at the images. It is even better in the classroom becasue she can verify that they are looking at the right things, and when students ask questions they can point to it on the computer screen instead of trying to explain what they are seeing through the regular lens. This is a great item for beginning to use a microscope and helping a child learn the ropes."
4,QX-5 Microscope Review,"I found it a handy device for certain magnification of items(I use it for coins). As all devices it has limitations, the plate area for placing items for magnification is too small by about a 1/4"" for my use. The lighting control is not really manageable as appears. The biggest problem is the table will not stay locked in place very well causing constant readjustment. Even with these issues it has been very useful to me for the price paid. It would be nice to upgrade the next version with a couple of improvements."
1,customer service sucks,"Like many others, I had a broken microscope and required the assistance of customer service to help trouble shoot. They only allow communication through email. Each email took on average 5 days to respond. After 4 emails I had exhausted their trouble shooting algorithm. Never once did I receive anything more than a standard format answer.Here is the last email:Hi,Unfortunately it seems that the software/hardware is not compatible with your specific computer model and configuration. We cannot guarantee that our products will work with all users. We have exhausted all possible trouble shooting steps for this product. Please use the product with a different computer or return to the retailer for a refund. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. If you have any questions, please reply to this e-mail.Best Regards,Digital Blue"
2,Not as good as the reviews - sorry!,"Cheap I suppose, but shaky rubbishy picture almost impossible to focus reliably.Hoping my child would enjoy: it is not user friendly enough for frequent use. I wish now I had not been so cheap and went up market a little :-)"
3,Not a great gift.,"I thought this looked like a fun and different gift for my sisters family who has every game, but loves boardgames. Unfortunatly the parents didn't like the idea of calling someone an idiot even in fun. So, unless you are buying it for yourself, think twice about giving it as a gift!"
3,Fire Trucks,I purchased this book to replace a school library book that our dog chewed up. It is in fine shape but I was disappointed to see that it was stamped discarded from another library and has a permanent library sticker on it. Now I feel that I need to purchase another one because it is not a suitable replacement for the one that was ruined. Future books sold that are discarded library books should be advertised that way.
5,Sleep Deprivation,Previous reviewers promised that this book would keep you up late at night and it does. What a great book with strong characters and a believable storyline that kepts you turning pages to see what could possibly happen next. A must read.
4,pancake repairman is half right,"this record does sound like a banjo being tuned...but what beautiful soul cleansing banjo tuning it is...im familiar with the minimalist con artists that pancake speaks of and all i can say is...yes, on the surface it is easy to fake the sort of thing that happens here, but with akiyama you have the real deal. he is really onto something with his negative space aesthetic, you can feel it...that is the key...you can feel it. a smattering of notes, a long silence, tension builds, ebbs and flows...like being deep in a cave, the eyes are useless so you make do with the nose and the ears and pretty soon you have a cathedral-like sense of the space, things are flitting around that you cant make out and you realize they are sounds falling off the face of the earth. akiyama allows a jaded music junkie like myself to reconnect with the very act of hearing again. recommended if you need that sort of thing yourself."
4,Wrong Color,Color stated was tan but color is almost brown that is why I gave them a 4 and not a 5. They fit like a glove and it's the 3rd set I have owned.
1,Please don't order this.,"It came in the mail, put a CD in it, worked beautifully. A few days later, put a CD in it, wouldn't work at all. It really is a cheap piece of work. I know you get what you pay for, but this wasn't worth what I paid. I was really disappointed."
3,better have a good memory,"if you like to put in a mp3 cd and hit play it sounds great and plays everything, good luck if you want to play in the dark or use the controls. you need a magnfying glass to see the buttons which don't stand out and to see the minute display. I prefer the iriver if you can find one for a few bucks more."
3,Logical Deduction,"This program is great for teaching logical deduction and attributes. However, in the XP version, the resolution should be better. In some of the sections, one or more of the Zoombinis are off the screen and it's difficult to determine their attributes."
2,Wrong toy sent,"I ordered a Sky Totter (stated as 97%) reduced, an item for the water that stated could support 1500 pds and shipping weight was 50lb. I was charged by amazon.com and received a package from Fat Brain Toys. I received a play parachute!! Something is definitely wrong with either how amazon posts, or the order numbers and communication with Fat Brain Toys. The kids love the parachute."
5,Sweet little book,"This was lovely to have as I am preparing my school for a performance of the opera. It was sweet, with lovely drawings...The perfect way to introduce the story."
5,Mama let him play,"Wow! I thought that the Eagles' ""Hotel California"" CD and Bread's ""Best of"" CD were good! Well, this one is AWESOME! From ""Down the road"" to ""Love is gonna find you"" Specially his smash hit ""Mama let him play""! Like Doucette says ""this is serious rock and roll"" Thank you Jerry for all the enjoyment listening to your CD."
2,NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT,"Hey just want to warn people that this is NOT the ORIGINAL MUSIC. Yeah, yeah many people know this but until the original score DOES get released (to the public) I want everyone looking for the original music to keep looking 'cause this ain't it!!! Maybe contacting the company who filmed the movie (Prime Time Productions & Paul Harrington) and requesting that it be released for retail purchase will help?Hope this helps and if you DO find the orginal score PLEASE respond to this review!!! :-)"
2,No songs from movie.....,"Although the music on this CD is ok, it is not any music from the movie. I was looking for some of the back ground music that was played during the movie or even during the menu part of the DVD. This is totally not it. It's still some what up beat music, but having trouble finding the link with the movie, except for the part it's called ""law of attraction"" music. Bottom line if your looking for some ok music the CD is ok, if you are looking for music from the movie, this is not it."
2,Bliss: Tribute to Secret Movie,My error. I thought this was a DVD (movie)not a CD (music). The music is nice but I would not have bought this if I knew what I was buying.
4,Nice Summer Read,What a nice surprise... Josie Pigeon is the owner of an all women construction crew who builds/renovates homes in an island community. Josie has a lot on her plate. She must finish construction on an expensive home before her business goes under. She discovers a body in the unfinished home only to have it disappear. Josie enlists the help of a sexy island newcomer and former prosecuting attorney.We get to know the cast of quirky crew members and a little bit about the handsome newcomer. The author does a nice job of setting up the characters for this series while moving the mystery nicely along. I wish there were a few more suspenseful moments. All in all a great summer read. I will be reading more in this series.
3,A fun mystery with a neat sleuth,The concept of a carpenter sleuth who owns her own all-female contracting business is neat. The mystery is decent and the story moves along nicely.
5,Moondance,"This album came after ""Astral week"" I find ""Moondance"" every bit as good, in fact more enjoyable to listen to. It has a timeless quality about it, and it really dos not sound like it's 37 years old. Overall it has a good fel to it. The first song,""And it Stoned Me"",reminds me a lot of the band, and the brass, which is used throughout. The album has a very soulful vibe. On a couple of the songs there's even a gospel flaver (""come running"" and 'crazy love""). When he sings""iI want to rock your gypsy soul"" in ""into the mystic"", he makes it sound like tere is nothing mor important in the world. The best moment on the whole album is""Turn it up? Turn it up? Turn it up? a little bit higher"" in caravan.If people listen to the album a few times, the songs will stay with them forever."
5,Excellent introduction in Van Morrison,I was only familiar with the Brown Eyed Girl and Gloria Van Morrison but bought this because of the strong 5 star rating with nearly 130 reviews. They are right. This is a great CD filled with easily listened to (not easy listening) music. The lyrics are absolutely heartfelt. The speed of the music fluctuates from not to fast to slow and cool. This would be great entertaining music for a small group of people or just for that one person.
5,"Hard to find better music then ""Moondance""","An album this great is fairly hard to come by. The musical talent and well-developed carefully orchestrated arrangements support Morrison's heartfelt vocal delivery of the touching, introspective lyrics. Morrison's visionary ability to be able to draw soulful, bluesy, jazzier influences and add about a pop mentality widens the appreciation value to encompass a majority of society making this album and others such as ""Astral Weeks"" must buys."
5,"astral weeks and moondance, a delightful combo","I love Van Morrison and this CD along with Astral Weeks is his best work by far. This album is joyful, thats really the only word, joyful. Van sat in a room all by himself and created a masterpiece. Moondance will rock your gypsy soul."
1,Gag! Cough!,"The little guy has no voice! Who told him he could sing???? The songs are stupid, lame, and they all sound alike. This stinks like a pile of bird droppings. He invents the stupidest word on the title track: fantabulous. How lame!!!!! This guy is irritating, stupid, and folk-obsessed. Duh!!!"
4,Moondance,Great music - was great to get back to some found memories of listing to Van MorrisonSome of his best stuff on this ablumn
5,Just what I expected,"Everything came when it was supposed to and in the shape expected. Good price, decent turn around, can you ask for more?"
5,"Van Morrison , Moondance","Bought this CD solely for the song ""Brand New Day"".Absolutely love the entire CD. Great music, and bringsback many memories.Highly recommend it."
5,can I give it 6 stars?,"I wrote a review for Days Like This noting that it seems like people only take the time to review the albums they love, and therefore it's hard to tell from them what is actually good. This is good. This is so incredibly good you won't believe me until you actually buy it. I can't say anything different from the others who rave about albums, only that I'm really, really not kidding. This album is healing for your soul. It's jazzy, thoughtful, insightful, and it's a relief to listen to, plain and simple. Listen to it while taking a bubble bath, or while sprawled on the couch with a cold beer pressed up against your temple. More accessible for new Van fans than Astral Weeks. I don't know how you could not love this album. Perfect."
4,not quite there,"Having eagerly awaited the release of these as remasters, I quickly purchased the 3 classic Van albums , Astral Weeks, Moondance , & His Band & Streetchoir in their new Japanese remastered format . I was slightly disappointed with the results as they are only marginally better then the domestic titles we have had for years. I wonder if they were remastered from first generation Master Tapes or simply a new reworking of the same old masters. there is no mention in the liner notes of having been redone by any person, the only place you will see mention of any remastering is in the Obi strip along the side . My advice would be to hold off on these and see what else comes unless you are a devote Van fan that perhaps the slight improvement is worth it for you"
5,A Fantabulous CD,"It's not often that you find this much fantabulous music on ONE CD! This is something you'll never get tired of listening to, once I take it out of my CD player, I want it back in there! The Bluesy, Jazzy, bopping music and lyrics make you want to dance, sing, sit back and relax and get mellow with your eyes closed all at once as Van the Man spins his tales in your head. It's just great, something I can't imagine NOT having in my collection. So put it in your CD player, put on the headphones, turn it up and sing along with Van, you'll enjoy yourself for sure."
5,Classic...,"The first song says exactly how I feel about this album. It ""stoned me to my soul"". It's classy, jazzy, romantic, heartfelt. It's what great music is all about."
5,Over the moon with moondance,"Maybe there is something in fiction or poetry than comes close to this as a source of pure pleasure, but I havn't found it. Even from another Celt!"
4,Van the Man,"I've always enjoyed his music, but one of my many favorites is Caravan, which I got on this CD. I've seen a video (it may be from The Last Waltz) of him doing Caravan and it shows his intensity and feeling for the song and lyrics."
5,So brilliant that the biggest hit is the weakest track,"This album is packed with Morrison's unique and staggering blend of blue-eyed soul. It's ironic to me that ""Moondance"" was the break-out song here since it's my least favorite song on the album. The best songs here, especially ""Into the Mystic"" and ""And It Stoned Me"" are among the best ever recorded by anyone and the rest is amazing and timeless as well. I guess I prefer ""Astral Weeks"" and ""St. Domic's Preview"" as albums but any Morrison fan needs to own this one, too."
5,Like honey for the soul,"Van Morrison + Your honey lover = one good timeIf you are looking for an album to chill out with, especially in the company of your signifcant other, you can't do much better than this. If the songs on ""Moondance"" aren't enough to convince you to get your groove on, I seriously reccommend you check your pulse."
5,"A wonderful, romantic, walk through music","I walked down the aisle to matrimony 2 years ago, to the sounds of ""Brand New Day"". So many of the songs on the album remind me of times in my childhood, and adult life. This album makes me want to laugh, dance, cry, and celebrate life though the language of music. A must for any music collection."
5,"One of, if not THE best album I own","I cannot believe the number of years I considered myself a fan of music and was not aware of the unbelievable talent of Van Morrison. Every song on Moondance is better than most of the releases of current albums coming out I have been buying. I was happy to hear ""Into the Mystic"" in the movie ""Patch Adams"" maybe more people will discover Van Morrison. If you want an album that does not contain a bad song this is it."
3,Weak lyrics,"I like Van, and this is a pretty good CD,I guess. I just find that I'm not that motivated to listen to it very often. Moondance has been played to death and the rest of the songs are just okay to me. Actually, most of Van's stuff is just okay. This CD's best songs are at the beginning, the songs diminish in quality as the CD progresses. As usual, the lyrics are never beyond servicable. Van has a tendency to write rhymes instead of interesting lyrics. ""These dreams of you. So real and so true"", ""Everyone, everyone, everyone ,everyone"", ""And it stoned me to my soul, stoned me just like going home"". Not very inspiring, or interesting. It's a nice Sunday morning CD, I suppose, but not as good as Astral Weeks--another CD with its share of bad lyrics. ""As I venture in the slipstream between the viaducts of your dream."" Pretentious and sometimes, unintentionally funny. You're better off downloading individual songs form Van's catalog. His CDs are just too spotty."
1,OVERATED,this cd has to be one of the most overated ablbums ever. I am a classic rock fan and bought this album at the advice of my friend. I listened to it many times and i can't believe anyone likes it. The songs are boring and repetitive. It is terrible.
5,A fantabulous night for romance ..............,Sublime. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. So pure. So clean. Unprocessed like a hay field should be. Just enjoy it.
