5,"The real deal, sweet home Chicago",This album is so magnificent and the essence of the blues at it's most primal and magic level. You must hear this unamplified or gussied up studio tricks to really find the heart of the blues.
1,If the devil pooped...,"Yes, we all thought it would be good but it is best to chalk this one off as a loss. If you were unfortunate enough to be someone who actually paid for the album, the going rate on ebay is around 9"
3,Acoustic Blues,"This is a good representation of traditional acoustic, country blues. The playing is great. The songs are a little on the average side."
4,Raw,"...and I mean raw in a good way. This CD is old school blues. The combination of two giants in the blues world is wonderful. The combination of a lone guitar and harmonica is blues at its best. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because I would have replaced a few of the songs on the album with alternates that I felt didn't work quite as well as others. I hate to think what might have been left on the proverbial ""cutting room floor""."
4,Grant Green's Jazzy funky best,"Those of you who are fans of Grant Greens early work (idle Moments, Matador, grant stand ect.) may turn your nose up to some of his later funkier efforts. Personally I love it. Grant green was one of the first artist to start what they now call acid jazz and his work heavily influenced hip hop music. Volume II of the best of grant green contains the best of his jazz/ funk records from the late 60's and early 70's. What's here is the trademark grant green non chord playing and improvisationational style laced with funky beats. The gems of this collection is the incredibly fonkay james brown cover ain't it funky now and the staple of blue note breakbeats sookie sookie. Other tracks that stand out is the effortless ballad cease the bombing and the all out jam session windjammer."
5,So well written...,"Robert Gurval is a great writer. In a field of dry style and stale ideas, Dr. Gurval is a welcome change. If this book is in your field, you really should read it. His book is well organized, complete, convincing and stimulating."
3,Hit Man In The Hand of Buddha,"This was an okay flick - surely not included in my top 5%. The Martial Arts Theater copy had very poor sound quality - far too low and very crappy for a DVD. Maybe I got a bad copy - who knows.Pretty okay fighting scenes - I've seen much better. The plot was simple to follow and also very predictable. Overall, this is a decent flick to add to your old school Kung Fu collection."
3,Great book but...,"This is a great book, with lots of information written in it, but I guess I was expecting more photos, and there are none. There are drawings, drawings of colors, etc. I was looking for more of a ""how to with full color photos"" I guess, this is not it. I was looking for more pictures."
2,"Weird drawings, questionable science.","This book was fun to look at, but not really usable. Lots of stylized drawings and self-aggrandizing tales by the author and not a lot of realistic how-to. Also, the explanations about skin care were clearly not written by anyone with a science or medical background."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book had very few colour photos, no application techniques, and often incorrect statements about hair and skin types. There were no insightful tips or ""insider information"" that would have been useful to back up my current knowledge. Everything was rather juvenile, with suggestions such as ""wear sunscreen"" and the use of a curling iron too often can ""damage your hair."" Who doesn't already know that? The ""advice"" is not worth your money!"
1,Wrong product,"Image shows an LED based bulb, what was delivered was a dual filament incandescent bulb that does not fit a standard indicator socket.I plan to return these for credit."
4,Guitar players listen up!!,"Of Course William Clarke was a terrific blues harp player as this CD well documents. That being said, guitar players will LOVE this CD for the exceptional guitar playing of Alex Schultz. The opening track, ""Lollipop Mama"" is a clinic in west coast jump blues phrasing. If you are unfamiliar with Alex he is out of the Hollywood Fats, Junior Watson, Rick Holmstrom, Little Charlie Baty camp and he is VERY tasty. If you play or just really like blues guitar but do not usually buy CD's by harp players, buy this one!!"
1,Weak microphone.,"Simply put, this microphone is weak. Fed into my Audigy 2 ZS sound card (a fairly poweful card), it barely picks up a normal singing voice. It just doesn't record loud enough. There's not much for a microphone to do except record, and if it doesn't do that, then what?"
2,not worth it to me,A book must catch my attention in the first few paragraphs. I read the first page and even that didnt help
2,Not that good,"Okay book. I really didn't like this book that well, so I was glad that it was free. I guess I thought that it would be more supernatural than it was."
5,ALEXANDRIA . . . WHY?,"""Alexandria...Why?"" is the first film in Egyptian director YOUSSEF CHANINE's exquisite ALEXANDRIA trilogy. This is a drama about a BANK CLERK who dreams of coming to AMERICAN to find fame and fortune. But as Rommel's army approachs at the height of World War II, the young man struggles with issues of NATIONAL IDENTITY as well as of PERSONAL FREEDOM! This autobiographical film was the winner of the Special Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival! You two will be impressed by Chahine's intensely personal filmmaking! Once you have seen this film be sure to check out the rest of the TRILOGY with ""An Egyptian Story"" and ""Alexandria Again and Forever""!"
3,being gay in egypt,"When the society is not that open about it, the story is ok , Im not too trill about the acting"
4,First Steps Into the World of Science,"A beautifully illustrated picture book with just enough text to intrigue the preschooler or introduce the grade schooler to the world of a snail. As an elementary school teacher I recommend this book for use during investigations of animal families or as a motivational tool for writing. The delightful text describes basic anatomy, habitat and predators. Contains an interesting facts page. Great for pre-kindergarten thru 3rd grades."
5,Sweetly Gentle & Informative,"My son is 17 months old, and he loves 'nails-- as he calls 'em. So when we went to our local library to find another book on the subject, (He loves Ruth Brown's ""Snail Trail"") we were coming up empty-handed. Fortunately, this Backyard Book came to the rescue. A good children's author almost makes you feel like they are in the room chatting with you. Judy Allen's story of snail life is gently witty, informative, and beatiful to look at. My husband's interest was piqued, too. My son just kept murmuring ""Nail!"" as he looked at the pictures. He will definitely grow well into this one, and I intend to scout out the whole series. Bravo!"
5,Science for young children,"We have ordered the majority of the Backyard books for our daughter who loves science. Good explanation, fair illustrations. Has been great for preschooler, early elementary age child regarding understanding material and encouraging interest in science. Our favorites are ""Are you a Ladybug"" and ""Are you a Butterfly"" but all books have been informative and fun to read! We have even learned quite a bit as parents and one of us actually has a science background."
3,"Good history, but there is better","Wells manages to write a fairly thorough history of the Roman Empire, however he excludes the era of the Roman Republic and that is my favorite period of Roman history (the Punic Wars ect...). I highly recommend ""The Will of Zeus"" and its sequel ""The Mask of Jove"". Although longer, these books are much more in-depth: by Stringfellow Barr. They detail the rise and decline of Greek culture and the Roman civilization. However, Wells' book is quality and if you are only interested in the Empire and it is a good read."
4,Readable introduction,"I was disappointed when this book arrived to discover that it only covers the years 44BC-235AD. Thus it is a history of the establishment and development of the Roman Empire and does not deal with its division or its ultimate fall in the West. I was also disappointed by the author's disdain for providing details about some of the emperors' more scandalous doings! That said, this is a very accessable introduction that provides a good base for continued reading. I was particularly impressed by the chapter explaining the sources available to historians, which was excellent."
2,Begat,"I loved Colin's book Sailing from Byzantium, which is why I got this. This enirely lacks the delightful writing of Sailing. It's got tedious chapters on political succession, quite boring."
1,Badly misses the mark,"Colin Wells knows his stuff, but this is a poorly written book. Seemingly aiming to appeal to both the specialist and the beginner to Roman history, the book fails to reach either. The book alternates chapters between the chronological political history of the Empire with the wider social history. While the chapters on social history are useful, the political history is awful. Mr. Wells presumes too much background knowledge from the novice, and I can't believe a specialist would care much for his flippant, two-page summaries of entire careers of certain emperors. To understand the basic structure of Roman government, I shall be forced to read another book, and I have no intention of ever returning to this one when my knowledge of the period is more developed."
4,Mike is right - user communication is everything,"Having worked with SW development for more than 20 years, I have finally realised, that face to face, collaborative communication between users and developers in an open atmosphere is the first important step on your way to successfull projects.Many books covers this briefly in a chapter or two, but with this book, you get a complete manual with techniques, that will be usefull to you in your collaboration with the users."
5,Change how you talk with Customers!,"Writing usable requirements in Agile spaces. Yet another well crafted message suggesting how to modify the method of eliciting requirements into something that makes sense from the perspective of the customer. Use the customer's language! Mike makes it simple, uses simple examples, and offers a clear path of application should one choose to traverse. The use of user stories moves the focus of customer relationships from filling out documentation .. to creating and managing a relationship and expectations through customer accessible language."
4,Good overview,"If you a business analyst looking for a solid method for defining user stories or if you are now just beginning the implementation of the agile methodology in your IT organization and need to learn what user stories are, how to write them and why this method *works*, this is a solid reference guide. I have both the published version (for lending/reference) and the kindle version (for reading)."
5,A valuable book that supports any agile methodology,"Every agile methodology advocates iterative, story-driven (although they may call them features or backlog items) development and so one might assume that an entire book on user stories and iterative planning would be redundant-not so. Mike has added both a breadth and depth to the body of information on this subject as his obvious practical experience shines through. Both little tidbits, like constraining estimates to specific pre-defined values, and responses to frequently asked questions (for example the best contrasting of use cases versus stories that I've seen) give Mike's book significant value for anyone practicing agile development of any flavor."
5,Training with NLP is great,"This is a very good book. I have been training for decades and have never encountered a book like this.The systematic explanation of how to do training is great . It will inform even the most experienced trainer. I was also very impressed by the way the author used the NLP techniques in the book. The thought of being able to train with these techniques is very exciting. Buy the book ,Quickly!"
3,Average performance that at times drags a little,"Unlike the Amazon reviewer Edith Eisler, I did not find the performance ""immensely exciting, expressive, and evocative."" At 71 minutes this is perhaps the longest Bruckner 4th I have heard. I thought the 2nd movement dragged a little as did the middle song portion of the 3rd movement scherzo. The orchestral playing seemed average to a little above average. This is strange feeling for me since I cannot remember ever thinking ""average playing"" in connection with the Berlin Phil.I much prefer either the EMI Karajan/BPO, or the Deutsche Grammophon Karajan BPO mid 70s (for that matter lets throw in Barenboim BPO) 4ths over this Rattle BPO rendition."
4,Disagree with editorial review,"I disagree with editorial review. Again the superficial stereotype of Bruckner sounding like Wagner (we are not in the late 19th Century anymore); again the criticism of grandiloquence.What we expect from an editorial review is an objective assessment on the recording and its interpreters, not a personal, petulant criticism on the composer."
4,How Do You Rock?,"Elvin Bishop's ""Big Fun"" is just that. He uses that guitar like a weapon and there are some licks captured here that make my hair stand on end, even after eleven years. I was Elvins Road Manager at the time this was recorded and must have listened to this record in process over 1000 times and it still holds together for me. It is a good time record and I'm just sorry that it didn't sell more copies or be better known. The guy that did the editorial review, Hadley or whatever his name is, has one thing wrong. The persona that Elvin took on, or more acurately was saddled during his Butterfield years with was ""Pigboy Crabshaw"". Just take a listen to ""She puts me in the mood"" and you'll realize why he is not ""Pigboy Crabshaw"" But legendary gutarist Elvin Bishop."
3,The Sound On Vinyl Is Better,The material is good.The CD sounds a bit edgy or shrill compared to the vinyl album which has a smoother sound.
4,another winner by Forster,"It's Italy. Older English woman falls in love with young Italian stud. They marry and have a baby. English woman's relatives disapprove of the match and kidnap baby to be brought up ""properly"" in England. But terrible storm. Carriage flips over. Baby dies. Forgive me if it looks like I'm trying to be too clever or curt. Seriously speaking, if you really enjoyed ""A Room With A View"", you'll enjoy this novel as well.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
1,Kindle version: serious formatting errors,"It's free, so I can't really complain. BUT: each sentence ends this way: "".¿"" I don't know about any of you, but this is completely annoying and distracting while trying to read the book."
3,Depressing,"A bit depressing... By the time you get to the end, you don't know what you want for the characters, which I guess is a triumph for the author. It's not that they aren't compelling and you just want to be done with them. The two main characters are likable. You want them to be happy, but at the end, it's the author's vision that you are seeing. It's not necessarily your choice, or what you would have wanted, but you don't hate what happens either. It's one of the few books that the author really carries the reader where they want them and even, against their will."
3,"Tragic, but strangely appealing","This was quite a tragic tale, so I'm not quite certain why I liked it. Perhaps it is because of the artful prose and insight into human nature. There are many compliments about Italy, where much of the book is set, and some jabs about Germans. I didn't love it like some of Forster's other works, but strangely it did captivate me. It isn't my favorite Forster novel, but I did like it.Most of the characters in this short book are motivated to act for all the wrong reasons, which generally results in unhappiness all around. A good many characters are manipulated or driven by a domineering family matriarch and social snob, Mrs. Herriton. The characters acting either against or because of Mrs. Herriton's prodding generally see unsatisfactory results. In fact, it is her desire to maintain her sense of family honor and prestige that puts the whole tragic tale into motion. It is a cautionary tale about what can happen when one cares more about appearances, than people."
3,Ignore the picture,The goggles did not look like the picture but they do work well.Comfortable to wear.
3,"Peachtree -- good product, poor customer service","Peachtree is a proven product with a long track record. I have used them for years and upgrade every two years or so. But, as the ownership has changed, their focus on revenue means that customer service is short changed. You will never get through to customer service. If you call, you will be put on interminable hold. They will never return an email and there is no mechanism to leave a return phone number. So, if you have problems, you are on your own."
5,Best ever,This is the only sunscreen that really protect my face. I do outdoor sports and this cream is te best!
3,Doesn't Work for Me,"I have skin allergy toward sunblocks. Tried many many sunblocks and I still got rashes and some was so bad it took a whole month to recover. I thought I can finally be out and about enjoying the sun again with Vanicream Sunblock but no, it was not meant to be because a few minutes after I put a little bit of it on my skin as a test, I started feeling itchy and soon after - the rashes appeared. I do have to say I like the fact that it's not oily and doesn't give you an extra sheen of sweat, like you just got out from the shower. I'm just glad I didn't buy the big ones."
5,Works without causing allergic reaction,"Our preschooler is wildly allergic to regular sunscreens. His doctor gave us a sample of this sunscreen, and now he wears it any time he's out in the sun. No more swollen, itchy red skin! So glad there's something he can use!"
4,99 silverado z71,"parts are certainly as strong or stronger than OEM. However on my vehicle it only raised 1 inch, that is enough to clear a 285/65/18 nitto trail grappler which is a 32.8"" tire. the rear end is still a little higher than the front so its not a exact leveling kit.ride quality did not change, it still drives as it did with OEM keys."
4,...Their Kung Fu is Very Good....,"Bought the DVD based on AMZN recommendations. First 20 minutes is so bad, it is almost funny (its appears the actors didnt want to hurt each other so they took it slow and easy). Then things pick up, intensifying. Swordplay is one of the best I've seen - exciting as it is long. Must see. The end however reverts and becomes real hokey - you'll know why when you see it. Overall, its pretty awesome and worth it. BUY!"
2,Too Chop-Socky for Me,"This film though not unentertaining, seemed like a chop-socky movie with swords and blood. The choreography feels staged rather than natural. The swords don't look realistic."
3,Last Hurrah review,This movie starts off a little slow and has an interesting story line though. Sometimes kung fu movies will not have much action and the storyline wont be interesting but this one is. There is an excellent sword fight in the middle of the movie and to me is the best fight in the whole film. The movie drags on near the end and doesnt seem to end the final fight is a bit of a let down. The villian at the end doesnt seem to bring any excitement to the fights and is kind of boring to watch. He is one of those villians you just want to watch die very quickly so the movie will end. Some villains in other movies are so cool you kind of want them to have a good showdown with the hero/heroes but not the villian in this movie. I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars b/c it wasnt awesome but it wasnt horrible either. The only reason why i picked this movie up was to see Venoms (#2 snake) in this movie.
1,Last Hurray Indeed......,"Save your money, and your time. I took this movie out of my player after 10 minutes. I was hoping it would get better, it didn't. It has a good title though, after that it's all downhill."
4,Buyers' alert,"Given the prices that sellers are charging for this book, interested buyers should know that The Center for Children and Theology sells it online, new, for $16.00."
3,"Great Concept, Disappointing Execution","Insect Dreams starts out well but after 50 pages or so Gregor Samsa travels to America. After that the book is a rehash of American history from the 1920s to 1945 with Samsa (like Zelig) meeting various celebrities and politicians. As I already knew how that history turned out, the plot held little interest for me."
4,UUbooks Selection,"Insect Dreams is the UUbooks.org book-of-the-month selection for October 2002. UUbooks is the online reading group for Unitarian Universalists and friends. We consider books by, about, or of particular interest to UUs. Marc Estrin is a former UU minister."
3,Insect Dreams,"The book wasn't at all what I had expected. Was looking for a conversation between Samsa and Dr. Suess that I had partially heard on a public service radio station. Guess this must have been the original idea with the complete world travels of Samsa. Other than that, which wasn't anyone's fault but my own, the book was in new condition, shipped on time. Will probably just donate it to the local library."
4,BBB pedal wrench by chance?,I gave this pedal wrench 4 stars only because its quite heavy for its size. Tends to be on the burly side so it's not a pedal wrench you would want to haul with you. Maybe heavy means its strong? Seems very strong... I took a chance trying an unusual brand name (BBBCycling). Which im actually glad I did and saved a few bucks compared to other brands I looked at. I'd reccomend this to anyone looking for a cheaper pedal wrench! Im sure this will last me many years of use.
5,Excellent pedal wrench,"I felt that this pedal wrench is top notch. It has a comfort handle and the wrench is made from hardened steel. It is not flimsy but thin and strong enough, with leverage to fit and loosen a stuck pedal. Great pedal wrench when compared to Park's and other brands."
4,Good vibrations!,"This album of Ellis is good,consistently full of new musics and shows that he is a great writer and put emotional feelings in his work! I've liked so much the drums of Scott Meeder!Really a good,good job!"
2,gypsy boys,"another boring dvd!! why do so many gay movies involve going to a gay bar, drinking, & wondering why a guy can't find Mr. Right? What a boring way to sort out relational problems!"
1,"bad,bad,bad",this movie was a real bomb. tired men with tired one liners that have been said a thousand times.the queens were obnoxious and the others just plain boring.no real plot going on. I've seen alot of gay movies thanks to netflix and this was one of the worst.
1,This movie is a real piece of crap.,"Infantile, sophmoric and just plain dull, Gypsy Boys tries to match wits with Queer As Folk but comes off as a very bad high school filmmaking piece. Never taking flight, the movie remains as moribund as director/writer Brian Shepp's imagination. Terribly written, horribly acted, and directed without even a glimmer of moviemaking knowledge, the unattractive cast has nowhere to go without a story and without dialogue that makes you anticipate the next scene. The characters that never grow, never change, and really have nothing to say. All I heard through the whole film was ""Blah, blah, blah"". I'm amazed this movie got made. It's a complete mess and removes any credibility that gay filmmaking has achieved."
1,"Minimal Plot, Minimal Script, Minimal Acting","This movie has virtually no plot and what it has seems like a ripoff of ""Queer as Folk"". With one exception, the acting is at a high-school level as is the cinematography. It looks like an amateur film done with poor home video equipment and a self-indulgent script with corney lines from the 70's. Spend your money on better stuff."

2,Cut in half,"I bought this DVD and am very unhappy. Sum of the movies like ""Go For Broke"" were cut off in the middle of the movie. Other's were copied my sources of dubious question."
3,Can't beat the price for these old war classics,My 12 year old son and I very much enjoy WWII films. There are several in this group of 50 that are worth the price of the package.
5,war classics 50movie pack collection,"Highly recommened!I spent the whole saturday sitting in front of the battle action.What a great way to spend a day! To many stars to list ,but I'm sure you'll find someone you like in there.Its the who's who of the 1940's .These film are great for a rain filled day,so you can watch as much as you want,or the wife will allow."
4,War Classics 50 Movie Collection Pack,"The documentaries are great. The movie selections are far reaching, some real classics and some vague titles that leave a bit to be desired. All in all well worth your investment, and own a nice pack of war and war related movies."
5,Unlocked 67 years of questions,"Thank you for making this DVD set available. This unlocked 67 years of many questions I had about what my dad probably lived through and who spent a year and a half in the miseries of Guadacanal as a Comm Officer for the 43rd Infantry Div, 1942 and 43. He also spent many years in Germany and was called back in after 30 years service for the Laos Crisis because he learned Mandarin (Chinese) collecting intelligence for the League of Nations on the Yankze River in the late 30's. What few times I had the chance to see him, he wouldn't talk about the horrors of his experiences."
5,I Love Amazon DVDs Dept.,"This order was sent out 24Dec06 and I got it on 03Jan07...I viewed all 50 DVDs and all were pristine clear as a bell...I rate Amazon.com with 5***** thank you, Amazom.com....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF"
1,Mill Creek rip off,"They aren't actually thieves. Mill Creek movie packs have a lot of gristle. The WarClassics collection contains 20 half decent movies, 5 clunkers, and 25 poorly copied documentaries."
5,vinyl,"disya maan n i-roy beat any rappa, dem talk so fass, dat u can never ever rpt whadem say like speedy gonzalus, riva riva, homre......zzzzzz.these two can 'light up your life'. juss too good. and yes, the back of the vinyl has four fotos, pullin on his coconut made chalice, next one blow thick smoke outta his nose, third one, out his mouth, but can still see his face, and last shot - no can see u-roy, him gowan! totally n absolutely, unda da smoke.gotta dread inna babylon, got keep fightin 4 ur rights."
3,Johnny tries too hard!,"When a man who had an R&B hit in 1957 gets to cut an album for Alligator records in 1991 it's only natural that he wants to show the range of his talents. Unfortunately producer Dick Schurman didn't manage to curb his inclination to show the width of his multi-instrumental talents - and that's the problem with this album. Where he concentrates on playing ONLY B3 or guitar the tracks are strong, but the two versions of ""Tongue"" have him playing flute and Bass Guitar ( as well as the unexpurgated version having J'neen on vocals and a brass section )and it muddies the mix. It might also have been better to have only used his road band of Rich Forman (guitar) Artis Joyce ( Bass) and Big John Evans (drums) because they clearly understand what he does best which is up-tempo driving blues.There's the basis of a good album here, but it wasn't realised by this release."
5,best night lite ever with motion light,"These night lites are great - I use them at the top of the stairs and one downstairs in the kitchen just in case. they only come on when it is dark and when motion is detected, a brighter lite shines for 90 seconds or so, and When you pull them out of the wall - they are an emergency flashlight - how great is that! thanks so much!"
4,Nice,Very nice product. Function pretty well and arrived on time. The price is not too low in comparison with similar products
5,Should have bought more!,This is a great product! It fully met our expectations and we wish we had bought more to put in other areas of our house besides the main corridor.
2,Bad Quality,"My original review was positive (see Great Light!!!, May 3, 2007) I have since then changed my mind:I bought two of these for my house. They were purchased with the idea that they would provide light to guide my family out of the house in the event of an emergency. One has stopped working completely and the other barely works. If you just bump it, it stops working and you need to wiggle it into the outlet just right to make it work again. My take on this product is that they are trying to impress you with a lot of bells and whistles, but fail in the long term to supply a quality product. If you buy this product you will very likely be left in the dark when you need it the most. The concept was good- the quality not!"
3,IF THEY WORK,"BOUGHT TWO ONE WORKS FLAWLESLY THE OTHER LIGHT FLICKERS WHEN IT GOES ONNO RETURNS ON OPEN PACKAGES, BE AWARE !! THAT SUCKS AT $25.00 A POP."
2,"Good concept, weak design.","I like the features of this light - nightlight is a good color and the right brightness, motion sensor is sensitive. The down side: after a week or so one of the 3 LEDs in the flashlight part started to flicker and got very dim. Two weeks later another LED did the same thing, so I am in the process of getting it repaired under warranty, which costs me shipping to them and $5.00 more for them to ship it back. Hope this was an isolated case of a defective unit."
2,"Perfect, if.","I bought 2 of these in January, and liked them so much, I bought 2 more in March. One of the January units started flickering in March, and one of the March units started flickering yesterday. The concept is perfect, but the reliability is poor. It appears that there is about a 50% failure rate."
2,Don't buy it. Use the online version.,I bought this dictionary a long time ago and have never opened it... Go online to the DRAE site. No vale la pena. Not worth it.
1,The least complete Spanish dictionary published,The dictionaries produced by the RAE are extraordinary for the large number everyday Spanish words that are excluded or only partially defined.A fun after-dinner game with friends is to sit down and guess which common words (not necessarily obscene) are not included.Hours of fun for people who enjoy language - and for this reason alone I recommend this dictionary.
4,Dictionary to update yourself,"The RAE (Real Academia Espanola de la lengua) has accepted/approved so many new words into the Spanish language, it is hard to keep track of all of them. This particular dictionary makes you review, revise and check the new words that now exist in the Spanish language. If you are a Spanish teacher or a Spanish professor, it is advisable to obtain this dictionary, when you write an essay, an article or you simply want to know how something is spelled or what's the translation of it, watch out! You may be surprised the different ways something can be written or said now. This is a dictionary that all Spanish instructors should have. It is not a regular Spanish-Spanish dictionary, it is a form of dictionary with definitions just to double check how a new word is written, to update you and to make you aware of the new words the RAE has approved."
5,What I was expecting,"What I was expecting,a really good dictionary for a good price, it have been a long time since i bought this product for one of my customer and I have not receive any complaints about it."
5,Works great on my 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer,"I purchased this here and had Best Buy install it for me. Works exactly like the XM version used to work, but does Sirius instead.We already had Sirius for another vehicle and wanted to just add on another Sirius radio to that account, instead of paying extra to activate XM on the Trailblazer. This did the trick. Works just as if Sirius came factory installed.Obviously this is an older product, so don't expect it to work as well as the newer Sirius radios. The delay is a second or so longer when going under a bridge, little things like that. No major issues.If you want to convert an old Chevy that has XM over to Sirius, this is the product to get."
2,GM Sirius,Product Quality is great. The ease of Installation is another thing. I have a 2003 chevy Avalanche and it has been a chore trying to put it in. I will try again when the weather gets warmer.
3,OK FOR A 2006 and older NOT OK for a 2007 or NEWER,great product for a 2006 and older chevy but NOT FOR A 2007 OR NEWER CHEVY!!!!!
5,Insanely Good,"LOVE IT! Every recipe works and the results are mind bogglingly delicious! Who needs fancy baking books filled with hundreds of recipes, many of which don't work, when this one has a small but perfect collection sweets! Give it as a gift to yourself or anyone else."
4,More than fills the bill.,"I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law, an excellent and generous cook. She is always on the lookout for new, tasty recipes and says she is very pleased with the dishes she has tried from this cookbook. (If I had had the chance to sample the seasoned nuts she made, I might well have given the book 5 stars rather than 4.)"
2,Stuff only a newbie wouldn't figure out on their own,"I just purchased this book after reading the other review for this book. I expected that I'd learn at least something from it, but found that the Killer Tips were actaully largely straight-forward configuration options (that you can find out by just clicking on Preferences for the various apps).If you're a brand new Mac user or really don't like to spend at least a little time getting familiar with the new OS on your own, maybe the book would help. But I couldn't pawn this book off on a friend who's had his Mac for 3 days, so I suppose it depends. Killer Tips, they are not.I wish they had that ""Look Inside"" option for this book because you could then get an idea of whether the book would help you out. For me, it's a quick return."
3,"Clever ""gay"" film with funny turns","Bedrooms and Hallways is not a unique ""gay"" film. It actually delves into fairly well covered territory: gay guy falls for straight guy who gives in only to discover he really is ""straight"". Doesn't sound too familiar? No? Watch this quite well done film and you will find that it is a bit typical of the genre, but it does it quite well and thus rises above the rest.Comical bits abound and are handled deftly as are the serious ones. You can't help hoping that the cute couple survives in the end, but you know they cannot.If I seem to be a bit ambiguous about this film, it's only because the film does so itself more often than I'd like to see. However, the acting is superb and the direction spot on. If anything it's the meat of the story that I'm not nuts about.Check the film out and I think you'll enjoy this tried but true formula presented in a ""unique"" fashion."
3,British friends,"This ensemble comedy is full of dating mishaps and successes. I entirely love how it poked fun at therapy groups and the ideals of masculinity. I thought it a bit awkward when our gay hero began dating this guy who never gave a clue about being gay. It sort of worked in the story, but it seemed abrupt. Still, this film is a definite must for gay Anglophiles and those who enjoy sexy, screwball comedies."
5,now one of my favorites,"Too funny for words. I've seen it so many times, I can't remember which scenes were predictable or surprising; but, it's a treat to watch over and over again."
3,Could have been developed further.,"Film was an interesting take on the boy meets boy genre. However, the plot developement was a little lacking and some of the situations were a bit contrived. Interesting in seeing the actors who have been in so many other british films, especially romantic melodramas, doing modern day roles."
4,bedroom farce,"i really enjoyed this video have seen it 3 times now each time finding it more hilarious.tells the story of three friends looking for love 2 gay guys and thier female flatmate.excellent preformances from all the cast especially simon callow and hugo weaving.if your looking for a good laugh,heartwarming story get this video."
2,film advocates one str8 night cures what ails GLB,"Irritatingly fluffy, and classically indicative of Brit camp, this one will make you want to fast forward to the next decent scene (not rewind as some of these other reviewers said. The eye candy in the men's support group scenes (and the notably brilliant performances by the guru and his wife -- an exception in this flick)can't sustain the whole movie. What really turned me off from irritation to outrage is the nasty ending in which the main character has sex with his high school sweetheart, a woman. Granted there was no indication that this encounter meant much of anything, but it truly offended me that a movie all about coming to terms with the funny poignancies of mature monogomy in GLB relationships could end by sending the message that all the confused and silly would-be monogamous gay man needs is a good roll in the hay with a pretty blonde waitress. Don't even bother renting it."
2,Juvenile and unstructured,"I love color, and i am not afraid of it. However, this book made me cringe. The combinations reminded me of what a trendy teenager decorator would do. In addition, the lack of an index drove me nuts."
1,A bad movie (bad meaning bad).,"Now I think Chris Rock is a good comedian. I enjoy him in most of his roles, but this movie STUNK!!!!! The acting was [bad] and predictable. Where did the script come from..Scripts R Us ? Reginia King was the best thing in the movie and I am not a fame of hers at all. The story didn't match the trailer. You go into the movie thinking that you will see Chris interchanging a lot with the white character he was supposed to be. That happened about three times...maybe. [....]"
3,down here on earth,"An aspiring Black comedian is killed in an accident before his big break. The angels made a mistake; it is not his time to go yet. So begins the process of finding a new body... Until the permanent body is found, he needs to temporarily reside in an old rich White man's body... As a result, most of the movie is revolving around Chris Rock's adventures in his temporary body...This movie falls into the comedy genre and is able to pull consistent laughs from the audience, however, it falls short in the technical field. The script is a bit loose and the acting skills are not up to the par either.All in all and interesting mediocre comedy..."
4,"CHRIS is BACK, but he's not BIGGER and BLACKER...","The creators of AMERICAN PIE bring you CHRIS ROCK (Lethal Weapon 4, Dogma) as a black cool guy who suddenly gets caught... by a bus! In so happening, he dies a little too early, by forty four years... But ROCK comes back, but he's not black this time!!! He lands in the body of a rich white man- already you can expect the humor building up...Well without giving anymore away, I'm just gonna say-""CHRIS ROCK is hilarious, DOWN TO EARTH is super-charged with DIE HARD laughing!!! 9/10 STARS.""- MJV & the Movies"
5,Laughter,This is a great movie I looked all over for it I laughed forever I've shown it to everybody !
2,Down and out...,"Putting a racially political twist on a familiar tale, this film just seems too mild for its own good. The laughs are not big enough and the film barely `goes there' where there is plenty of room to move. Chris Rock loses almost all of his edgy endearment by going too `light' here. The film is fun in a way, but it feels very watered down; almost like an elongated sitcom. Regina King is always great in these roles (and any other role she tackles) but even she can't add the credibility needed to make this film anything more than a `paycheck'."
4,2 FUN MOVIES - 1 GOOD PRICE,"Chris Rock is funny in each of these movies and never fails to poke fun at any stupidity regardless of race. In light of Obama's election to president, Head of State seems even funnier this time around."
5,Head of State: Bernie Mac in rare form,Love Chris Rock but Bernie Mac made the movie for me.Great cast.
3,Very few new things in this film,"It's clear this is the n-th version of ""Heaven Can Wait"". As a remake, not many new things could arise in this film.There are some new things, of course. Some of them are quite reasonably different: the story in this case is about a black man living in the Bronx; the return to Earth is due to the chase of a girl and so this is sort of a (then again) romantic comedy.But some other things make me feel really dazzed. Heaven is... Las Vegas? Gatekeepers seem to be... like gangsters? And the highest expectation of the main character is... to be a great comedy club man? (and of course not to be booed every time he is acting).The romantic moments are given by Chase Rock, but the great comedy moments are for Chazz Palmintieri. At least, his appearance makes this film not to deserve a lower rating.You can have a good afetrnoon at home with this film, but don't expect so much of it."
4,A brilliant example of a well written comedy,"What if heaven had a mix-up and you found yourself dead 50 years before you were supposed to be? Well, that's what happens to Lance Boston (Chris Rock) in this amiable comedy. Lance is a stand-up comic who is on the verge of his big break when he pops his clogs. As compensation, of sorts, he is returned to earth, but -much to his horror- in the body of a fat old white guy. And what's more, the girl he's in love with now wants nothing to do with him. Comedian Rock had made a good job of moving from stand-up comedy to movie acting and brings a lot if energy with him. It's not subtle, but it is funny."
2,NICE TRY...BUT NO CIGAR...,"This is a disappointing remake of a remake. Chris Rock is an extremely funny guy, except in this movie. He has a pallid script with which to work that does not let his humour shine through, except for infrequent glimpses. He is unable to carry this torpid film. Though he tries, he is hampered by the lack of chemistry between him and his female co-star, in addition to a bad script. It is just doesn't work overall, though not for lack of trying. Chris is a funny guy, but when it comes to films, he has yet to prove that he can carry one"
2,Chris Rock can do better than that!,"The movie is quite ordinary. The comedy is also ordinary. I don't remember laughing at all, I just gigled once or twice.Even the jokes told at the stand up comedy scenes were not that good.For a comedy movie, it is disappointing."
2,SOmething is wrong with Rock here..,"The idea is good, some scenes are great, but Rock's acting is weird here. It's like he was not comfortable with the character and his dialogues, or something else... weird..."
1,Weak effort all the way around,It is hard to understand why Paramount even released this movie. Either the actors were just looking to collect a check or the director had better things to do. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I gave it one star because this format wouldn't let me give it a zero.
2,Pretty dull and silly,"I think this movie would have been really funny if the white character (the billionaire) appears more and acts like a black person. I cracked up when he was rapping. Unfortunately, all you see is Chris Rock acting as himself, trying so hard to be charming, but can't do it. I couldn't find myself laughing at any of his jokes or acts. On top of that, the female character is not at all attractive. This movie has nothing special, and I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater. I gave it 2 stars for 'nice try'."
5,Great Aftermarket A/F sensor,"I am very skeptical of aftermarket replacement parts since working for different OEM dealerships for over 25 years, nearly 20 years with Toyota alone and a Toyota MDT since 1998. The first thing I look for during a diagnosis is aftermarket parts. They generally do not work. Denso is the OEM supplier for the Lexus IS300, but even the factory part has had several iterations due to problems with original part. This is a plug & play part. The only difference I found was a harness loom to secure to the the frame rail that was very easy to switch over. The waveform was perfect and the heater circuit voltage is spot on."
3,One of the least interesting live Muddies,"There is a LOT of live Muddy Waters out there, ranging from the magnificent (like ""Muddy Waters Live At Newport 1960"") to the mediocre, and this one belongs with the latter.It's not bad, Muddy never was, but on ""Screamin' And Cryin'"" Muddy neither screams nor cries...it's a more laid-back Muddy Waters than on earlier recordings, and the set is burdened by too many s-l-o-w numbers and mediocre instrumentals, and not enough firepower.There are some highlights as well, of course, like ""Blow Wind Blow"" and ""Hoochie Coochie Man"", but there is really nothing here which isn't available in equally good or better renditions on other live recordings of the Muddy Waters blues band. This rendition of ""Got My Mojo Working"" is disappointing, and ""Screamin' And Cryin'"" lacks the intensity of terrific live albums like ""Mojo: The Live Collection"", ""The Lost Tapes"", ""Chicago 1979"" and of course the Newport album.Go for any of those instead; this one is for completists."
3,Nice tenderness; too much camp,"If you can get to the first scene with Veronica Lake--which isn't easy to do--this movie will take you in. (But can you sit through a ridiculous car chase, a hobo with a bag on a stick, a Negro cook who dips his face into pancake batter. . ? Some stuff from the 1940's cinema seems so campy, so silly, so sentimental. Imagine how absurd films made today will look in about 50 years. Everything will be hatred and explosion and outdated coolness.)But when Veronica Lake appears and friendship and romance and danger and trouble happen (all still pretty stylized), the film becomes likeable and effective.And, of course, as the saying went: Veronica Lake is easy on the eyes."
3,Bizarre sound encoding,"Dolby Digital 1.0Meaning it's all directed to the center channel. Usually most mono titles (often old movies) are DD 2.0, with the mono sound directed to the left and right speakers. This 1.0 business is odd and annoying. Criterion goofed."
2,I didn't care for it.,"I watch movies for entertainment and I did not find this movie that entertaining. Yes, I'm sure it made a big social statement when it originally came out in 1941 about the realities of prison life and the hard times just coming out of the depression but like I said, I don't watch movies for social statements. It's supposed to be a comedy but I didn't find too much funny with it. Sure there are some good scenes but in my opinion not many. I love other Preston Sturges comedies but not this one. The quality of the picture and sound on the DVD, both were very good"
2,Really not that great,"This movie has a couple of funny dialogue scenes, but it never really gels. The characters don't feel very developed. The story just isn't very involving. Veronica's dry/flat delivery doesn't hold up for the full length of the film. The ending is the epitome of Old Hollywood cheese.The Sturges biography included on the dvd was more interesting."
2,Be sure you're a fan,"Before laying out the big price for this superbly reproduced collection, you must be sure you're a Preston Sturges fan. See the first 20 minutes of Sullivan's Travels or the first half hour of Hail The Conquering Hero. Did you think that was funny? If so, you're a fan. Now I love the screwball comedies of the 1930s, and I like Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and the Three Stooges. Most black comedy appeals to me. I have, in short, a large sense of humor. But I cannot, for the life of me, fathom the alleged humor in Sturges. A script with a million words, constant and frantic action, and the crudest forms of slapstick leave me cold. Check out the fire scene early in Hail The Conquering Hero. Did you roar with laughter as people aimed firehoses at each other. Then you're a Sturges fan. Not I."
5,Fun classic in its own right,"This movie is a fine example of movie making in the forties. It has a very vintage feel with the exception of Joel McCrea who has a very contemporary screen presence. There are some very enjoyable pantomime sequences, typical of the era (presumably a quaint holdover from silent film), and lots of fast paced antics that will keep most viewers entertained.Our family wanted to watch this movie because we are big fans of the Coen Brother'sO Brother, Where Art Thou?, which is a title borrowed from the fictional movie in Sullivan's Travels. There are some points of tangency between the two movies but not enough to constitute a bona fide homage, so it is best to view this movie on its own terms."
5,Sexual Attraction Among Bluebloods,"Watch Joel McCrea demonstrate his ability to make women go weak at the knees as he tries to win back his high maintenance wife (Claudette Colbert at her classiest, sexiest best). The characters breeze their way through the film firing snappy reparte at each other, which is smoldering with sexual innuendo. Rudy Vallee and Mary Astor are great as the second bananas, and the rest of the cast is tremendous. Don't miss Charles R. Moore's hilarious explanation of JD Hackensacker's tipping generosity. Romantic comedies just aren't this subtle and witty anymore."
4,THE PALM BEACH STORY,"This is a great comedy to add to anyone's DVD movie library. I have watched it a couple of times because it is so funny and I loved hearing singer, Rudy Vallie's rendition of ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" with a full orchestra. Of course the leading actors, Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea did an outstanding job in their roles."
5,One of the best!,"This is one for everyone's collection, a true classic. Comedy, tragedy and social commentary all in one! Great dialogue and directing!"
3,3 titles are currently available - Universal double-dips again,"""Sullivan's Travels"" and ""The Lady Eve"" are currently available from Criterion (probably much better transfer quality) and ""The Palm Beach Story"" is currently available from Universal (not the best transfer), BUT I'm excited to get the other four....three of which are about as funny as many movie you'll ever see.I recommend you to buy this, but Universal needs to stop with the double-dipping.(for the record, ""The Lady Eve"" and ""The Palm Beach Story"" are also unbelievably funny...""Sullivan's Travels"" is a comedy-drama....the funny bits are histerical and the dramatic bits are very thoughtful.)"
2,Buyer Beware!,"...For my money (I bought Sullivan's Travels without seeing it first), this was the Fatal Attraction of classic films. In other words, the entire tone of the movie changes (mercifully) half-way through, and suddenly we have a new story. The first 2/3 of the movie is badly acted schtick. The scenes in the prison and in the black church are brilliant, despite Joel McCrea's hideous acting. And this from a viewer who likes Abbot and Costello, I Love Lucy, Gone with the Wind, and the wonderful Criterion Video, Children of Paradise..."
2,disappointing,"The movie is a light frothy comedy, too insubstantial for my taste. There is not much story and no depth to the characters. I didn't really like any of the characters in the movie so there is no incentive to see it again. It ended leaving one with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I got it because of Claudette Colbert but it was way below ""It happened one night"". If this is a screwball comedy, I'll be avoiding them in future."
1,A Bore,"A silly, sentimental piece of nonsense from the usually far more sensible Sturges. Unbelievable that it has become some kind of classic. A waste of time. See The Palm Beach Story instead."
1,Don't buy Preston Sturgis Collection,Awful. Don't buy the series. Not worth the money. Wish I could send it back.
3,Film,"It is a great film, but my internet was acting up and I paid from a movie that I didn't get to watch."
4,The Great Sturges,"I strongly recommended these films to lovers of madcap, so-called screwball comedy. (Even 'The Great Moment', a biopic about the dentist who discovered the use of ether as a painkiller, the sort of subject usually given a solemn treatment, is played for laughs.) They are some of the best examples of this cinema form that has had audiences laughing since the 1930s. The settings, fashions and manners might be of another era, but the droll dialogue and effervescent performances that Preston Sturges put to film are as fresh and cutting as ever today. The DVDs offered here are of excellent sound and vision quality."
2,utterly dissapointing,"Honestly, when it comes to the master of funk, i expect so much more. i bought this album to add to my p. funk collection expecting to hear some classic bass lines, and funky grooves but instead got a hip/hop infused, almost completely funkless, soulless album. i actually considered throwing it out the window after a first listen, the second listen saved its life. to say ive never been this dissapointed in an album is an understatement. RIP to the funk...."
4,Funky but Minamalistic,"George and the gang are back....the only problem is where is the gang? Don't get me wrong this is great, but it is such because so much of today's music is crap. The variety is 5-star. George trully loves music and you can tell the variety of different styles and featured artists is perfect. There are some cuts on here that are the bomb. My prblem is ""where are the musicians?"" I mean the real prblem with todays music is musicians or lack of. I bought this CD thinking the whole mob would be jamming out. But some tracks were made just like today's hip-hop and R&B. I was dissappointed....maybe on the next album he'll get the mob together and show these young cats the way the funk is supposed to sound!! Untill then this double cd of various recordings recorded over a pretty vast period of time will have to do. Long live the Funk!!"
3,Sloppy Seconds,"Not quite. FUNK is Funk. Just free your mind. Haters will hate. No, this aint the funk that we grew up on, but nothing stays the same. Although a bit long, this cd does have a lot of bright spots.Bounce to this, Su Su Su ,et al have that familiar Clinton harmony, gravelly funky voice, and all spaces filled. Too bad Bernie and Bootsy aint there. Coulda been better but it aint bad."
2,Not A Great Album...,"I'm a huge fan of all things George Clinton but lately his materiel has been lacking. Crowded with guests that most people didn't buy the album to hear. There are a few gems on here though. Paradigm, You Can Depend on Me, Inhale Slow with Paul Hill, Because/Last Time Zone, Sexy Side of You and Saddest Day with Belita Woods. If you're a die hard fan this will do to have in your collection. But if you are looking for quality materiel....it'd be wise to pass on this."
1,bring back the good funk....pleez!,POSagainGeorge what's wrong?I am an amature but I know I could produce you a cd that would sell.I would like to hear you like I hear you on RHCP CD Freaky Stylee.On that one you WERE on the Groove along with the GREAT RHCP.RHCP blow the pants off your funk now. It brings a tear to my eye why you can't keep the funk in line & all we get now is WAY OVER PRODUCED BS.NEXT!I still love you Gweorge..you mofo.... but come on...bring back the funk. remember the ONE.Call me & I'll produce you...get you back on track you poor misguided ex-funkateer.
1,"Ah, no...","This is not a very good P Funk cd, it's ok, but nothing special. Get their older stuff first, then this one. Get all of the spinoffs of P Funk too. If you like hip hop or drum machines, you may like this. There are a few Funkadelic type tunes, but like I said, nothing special. There is much better stuff out there. I'm a hardcore P Funk fan, I have over 50 P FUnk related cds and LPs, but this is review is only my opinion. If you like it, fine, but I don't think it's worth buying. ""Bounce to This"" and ""Viagra"" are cool. I like Sativa too, but I prefer her live. I prefer the current P Funk lineup live, they still put on a hell of a show."
2,Finally.....The End To P-FUNK,"Wholly disappointing. Hardly any remnance to the old Funkateers. There are talented musicians performing, but that is not what I paid to hear!"
1,"""You remind me of my jeep""",WHAT THE F--- IS R KELLY TRYING TO SAY? I LOOK LIKE A TRUCK? That is his way of saying he likes fat (Fabulous & Thick) girls. I can't stand him.
1,"i wanted a similar copy, but with an instrumental track.",you are a very reliable company. i have purchased alot of copies from you and i continue to recommend you among my friends. the problem is the copy you sent me not exacly what i wanted'
2,Just english,"No subtitles or another languages audio, shame. The season one have spanish audio and subtitles but this season is only english"
5,A Wonderful Sample of Brazilian Music,"This CD from Clara nunes is a unique one in terms of showing how elaborated was the music from Clara Nunes. You can also benefit of listening to a wide range of excellent brazilian musicians singing with Clara Nunes, like Milton Nascimento, Chico Buarque, among others. I really recommend this one."
4,The dealy on day after,"This is probably got to be the best album Ras has dropped to date. Almost every song is on point. Down South gets ya rowdy for Jesus, and Who's the Greatest gets ya thinking. Again though my favorite is the last track. It has to be the singing by the woman. She goes off. A definite good buy."
5,Desert Flower,"Best contemporary biop I've read! Incredible story! I've had my granddaughters read it, especially when they complain there is nothing to do! Nothing to eat! I think this should be required reading in freshman year high schools! She is an amazing woman!"
3,"Interesting, but not likely to happen again",Waris' story is a remarkable one but seems to be quite unbelievable to me. You could see that she did not write the book herself. Flaws in her character (like for example the habit of exploiding other people in order to achieve her goals -> Nigel) are not really shown. The way she talks about FGM make Western readers feel superior to the Somalian culture although it is very shocking to read. Waris' story is obviously interesting but at the same time extremely unbelievable and not likely to happen again.
1,Desert weed,"The premise is outstanding. In reality, this story was like flipping through a magazine on a bus while awaiting to get off at the next stop. ""Not fleshed out"" is how a literary agent would probably put it. Remarkable, but topical."
3,An unrealistic exaggerated story,"The book ""Desert Flower"" is an interesting and fascinating biography. The book itself is easy to read and to understand. Of course I was shocked about Somalian traditions and religion. But in my opinion, every traditon and religion has to be respected. The Western Countries cannot believe that their religion and their system are the correct ones. I also think that Waris Dirie has exaggerated in some passages which seem more ridiculous than serious to me. I don't know if she wanted to write the parts in that way or if the women who wrote the book believed that would be the right way to get a bestseller."
2,read INFIDEL instead,"I had read Infidel by Aayan Hirsi Ali and loved it so thought this would be similarly interesting. But whereas INFIDEL is well written and thought provoking, Desert Flower is shallow and poorly written and as others have mentioned the author seems to be quite self satisfied once she becomes glamorous in America. The two books tell a similar story but Hirsi Ali learns so much from her experience and shares with us her intellectual and emotional growth as she becomes disenchanted with Muslim fundamentalism after having tried to embrace it, whereas Waris Dirie just doesn't have as interesting a mind or at least doesn't express it. I was very very disappointed. If you read this and liked or didn't like it, I suggest you try INFIDEL, a vastly superior book on the same topic."
4,An eye-opener....,"Too many Americans do not understand the culture and traditions in many countries, and the ritual of female circumsicsion is one of those little known things. Waris' story taught me that you can overcome many obstacles, including life as a nomad, and go on to great things. I wish Waris all the luck in her future endeavors. And, I highly recommend this book to everyone."
2,"The journey was extraordinary, but . . .","Surprisingly enough, the author did not have much of a story to tell. The author tells a pretty good story about her life in Somalia. Once she leaves Somalia, her life goes uphill, however the book pretty much goes straight downhill from there. Instead of a storyline that flows, she pretty much compiles some not so interesting stories into random chapters. I have never read a book that was so choppy. One chapter does not flow into the next, so it was really hard to remain interested in the book. The author was certainly blessed to make it to where she did, but her journey didn't necesarily translate that well on to paper."
3,Interesting but muddled.,"This was assigned to me in a sociology of health class as a first-hand account of the practice of Female Genital Mutilation. Readers who delve into this book for this purpose should be advised that a relatively minimal portion of the story is actually devoted to that topic, and perhaps such researchers would be better served consulting more focused books on FGM. Although she does condemn FGM, this is much more a story of Dirie's escape from Somalia and her subsequent modeling career. Dirie's story is incredible; unfortunately, the writing style (ghost-written, I'm sure) is rather simplistic and often confusing. Details often seem muddled and the narrative is incredibly rambly -- as if the ghostwriter had merely sat down with Dirie, said ""Tell me about your life,"" and then simply transcribed and published everything she said, without much editing, rearranging, or polishing. Which is a very honest way to do things, but doesn't make for a great read."
3,Still a good read,"I had read an excerpt from this book years ago and when I saw that I could purchase it, I jumped at the chance. It really is a good book and I would recommend it to others to read. If you'd like an even better book, but along the same lines, I would strongly recommendSlaveby Mende Nazer."
4,Happy it was recommended,"This was an interesting book , because I learned a lot about another culture. Some of it was a little disturbing as it should be for anyone that reads it . I thought it was an easy read and glad I read it ."
4,Eye opening and inspiring!,An eye opening story about a horrific practice in many girls around the world and the inspiring story of a woman that wants to change it!
5,Desert Flower,"Book was great, yet sad. It is a sage that still goes on. I recommend this book to all females out there who need to step up and stop this insane practice."
3,Won't read it a second time !,"I'm innocent ! I did't want to read this book ! My teacher wanted me to do this ! But I want to give an objective point of view of this book, as far as I can. It is really interesting to know how a Somalian women made career in western society. I was fascinated from the beginning when Waris had a fight for her life with an ugly, bloodlusty lion. Nothing for real men !"
2,critical viewpoint,"I do definitely not consider ""desert flower"" as a novel I enjoyed to read. In my viewpoint it is quite horrible and boring. Actually I do not sympathise with Waris Dirie."
5,Brilliant,"This is a book sure to stick in your mind. This is the autobiography of Waris Dirie, who grew up as a desert nomad in Somalia, suffered female genital mutilation, and became an international model and United Nations ambassador. Waris proves to be headstrong and smart, with a deep sense of who she is and where she comes from. She's the best heroine you could find, and best of all - she's real. (A+)"
3,Desert Flower,"Hard to belive unless you have lived in Africa. I think a lot was left out, she became famous too quick. But all in all it was a good story."
5,classic,"perhaps one of the BEST of the 90's cartoons, def something that cannot be remade!! loved it as a child and i will always cherish it!"
3,The title gets it wrong!!,"If you're looking for a starting place for Lonnie Brooks, this isn't it. The basic band of Brooks, Tom Giblin on keyboards, Augustus Taylor on Bass and Kevin Mitchell on drums work hard to hold it all together but there are two main problems. Firstly Ronnie Baker Brookes muscles in on the action, and he's nothing like as good as Dad. Secondly the songs, particularly the Brooks' efforts are pretty forgettable. The best tracks on the album are are ""Temporary Insanity"" and Denise La Salles ""It's lying time again"". The only dual composition that works is ""If the price is right"" and that's because Koko Taylor takes the vocals.Buy the others first!"
3,Take to a baby shower.,"This book was a big hit at a baby shower. Place it unwrapped on a table and watch people, especially the mother, laugh as they leaf through it."
5,Naked Babies,"Quindlen and Kelsh truly capture the essence of ""baby-ness."" It took me months to read this book of photographs because every few pages, I would have to put it down and cry. The poignant writings and the stunning photography make this book a wonderful gift for expectant or new parents. Absolutely beautiful. Buy it for yourself or anyone who loves children."
2,"More babies, less musings please",The pictures are sweet but the text is very heavy and not compelling to read - it overshadows the images. Guess I was looking for something else - maybe not just one writer's endless musings.
3,Kinda like maternal porn-o.,"This seems to sum up our society's obsession with perfect babies as well as perfect women (and uh, maybe even perfect men??? Oops, better perish the thought!) Anyway, for a woman's amusement, there's glossy b&W page after page of exposed infant flesh to sigh (and maybe even moan) over. What this book DOESN'T show is filthy diapers, endless wailing, smelly messes, infanthood illnesses like colic and rash, even physical blemishes, or any other realities...just dewy, love-inducing, breast milk-wet little fantasy about all those intoxicating Kewpie doll-like creatures."
4,One Of The Masters Of The Hammond B-3!,"Richard 'Groove' Holmes was one of the great B-3 players from the 50's through the 80's. His style of funky soul-jazz/bop and grooving with the likes of Jack McDuff, Charles Earland and Shirley Scott and other great musicians proved he had what it takes to jam! This CD just SWINGS! It is so damn FUNKY!His version of the Duke Pearson standard 'Jeannine' really stands out as one of the great tunes on the album. His take on Bobby Timmons 'This Here' is another burner that swings!The classic Blues riff of the Title cut really gives Richard and the fellas a chance to lay back and just groove. It's nice!They also do a nice mid-tempo swing on the standard 'Secret Love'. His cover of Ray Charles' 'Hallelujah, I Love Her So' is another great cooker.I highly recommend this CD for fans of 'Soul Jazz' and the Hammond B-3 Organ stylings A LA Jimmy McGriff and Shirley Scott & The Late Great Charlie Earland."
3,Not a 50 Cent fan,I am a DJ and I do my own mixes. The only reason I purchase this single because of the acapella and instrumental versions. I am feeling the beat but the lyrics are lack-luster.
5,A Film All Americans Should Be Required To Watch!,I must recommend this film to any American who still thinks that we live in a democracy or that this is the land of the free and the home of the brave. Just how far down the rabbit hole you go after watching this important film is up to you... but it is a trip you must make...and soon.Thank you to the filmmakers for risking it all to bring people these painful questions about a day that has been used to justify the murder of far too many people and the loss of trillions of dollars. Thank you.
5,nothing is hidden,"full expose on the actual mechanics of kundalini, describes different techniques and effects, especially the most useful ones for a 'modern' lifestyle, gives an overall view, further reading on specific yoga styles and techniques are suggested"
4,Beautiful book with some damage in the upper right corner,"I am glad with the book. At the top-rightcorner there was some bending when I got it. I wonder if that was also the case when it was sent to me. The Envelope was notvery good. But it can be that the seller told in advance that there was some bending of pages. All the same, I'm very glad with it, and got it for a good price."
5,Great insight into the early days of personal computing,"I really enjoyed this book - lots of fascinating stories about the people and places and drug culture leading up to the personal computer - Doug Engelbart and SRI, SAIL, Fred Moore, Alan Kay, Xerox PARC, the Homebrew Computer Club.I thought I knew about these folks and things (I live next door to Doug Engelbart) but I had NO IDEA! The book is very readable, and John Markoff of the NY Times (he has quoted me a few times), does a great job of winding tales about the era and how lots of disparate ingredients in the Menlo Park and Bay Area petri dish gave life to computers for the masses."
3,Worth a read if this is your bag,"This book is not very well written. It jumps about a lot and often spends a whole page describing someone who then never appears again.However it is worth a read to remind us of the colourful beginnings of the PC age. The shocking part of the book is how advanced systems were in some research labs (mice, windows, email) in the late 60's and early 1970's. It makes you wonder why it took so long for these things to become mainstream."
2,Uneven and glaringly missing treatment of major players,"I'm no Apple fanboy. But Steve Jobs is barely mentioned in this book. Steve is open about LSD being a top contributor to this life views and his creative thinking. As Apple has a market cap now larger than Micro$oft, to give Steve scant mention in this book is really dumb. Steve, along with Bill Gate$, are the major computing culture players in our world today from that era. How do you think it is that Steve was able to come up with ideas like the Apple computer? The Mac? iPod? iPad? His mind had been opened to the higher frequencies of creativity through his experiences with LSD, meditation and so on. For that the book has really failed.The rest of the book has mediocre writing. It is not really engaging, does not read like something you can't put down. As others has said this is mainly a collection of anecdote and is not really crafted like a book. It's more like a really long magazine article."
3,"Good book, used but readable.","Arrived promptly. The covers and pages are in good condition. It is obviously used. Some pages have had a child scrawl in them with a pen, and there are other smudges, etc. All this is forgiven by how interesting and readable the book itself is."
4,"""Its Not the Right Alice""","A nice history of the early early days of personal computing. Course the story is told as though it all happened in Silicon Valley. I know many outside of Silicon Valley contributed. Still an interesting read, if you are into the history of technology. I was hoping the Dormouse would have a larger role in telling this story. Course you have to understand all the connections and connect all the dots traveling through the Jeffereson Airplane, Alice in Wonderland (were the dormouse is born), and O'Reilly's DNS and Bind books. But that's another story."
4,"A good reference, but a tedious read","I've been wanting to read What the Doormouse said since it came out, and finally got the chance to read it this week. I was disappointed, although now I have a lot of other books & videos to dig into as a result of reading this book.Markoff's thesis, that the 1960s psychadelic subculture shaped the ideas that lead up to the first personal computers, is pretty reasonable. The parties and grassroot organizations of the day brought people together, and the dream of a ""personal"" computer was just another example of ""power to the people"". He gives plenty of facts & tales to support this angle.My biggest complaint is that the book lacks a cohesive narrative thread. I like how Fabio Rojas describes it in his review: ""There are so many people that just appear and disappear that it's hard to keep track of them."" Several times, I wished I had taken the time to draw a ""family tree"" of the subjects, so I had some idea who they were and how they tied into everything."
3,Dissapointing,"I had high expectations of this book, sadly they were not met. I found for the most part, that the book was slightly more than a collection of somewhat disjoint micro-biographies of people (mainly male) whose signficance is far from clear, save for a few.One of the most glaring omissions, which should be enought to indicate the casual nature of the work, is the complete lack of discussion of Digital Research, a company that genuinely represented one of the strongest links between free thinking acadmia and commercial software business.Failing to include it's founder Gary Kildall as even a passing refernce represents not only incomplete scholarship, but incredible editorial oversight in my opinion.The book does cover a fascinating and important period and subject, but it's focus upon anecdotes and incompleteness makes it a dissapointment; perhaps there is scope for a proper covergae of this subject by a more thorough author one day."
4,I was there.,"I was there but not in an important enough role to be required by the story. Despite this, I knew some of the people and everything I could remember was true and accurate (two, not necessarily identical things). I applaud a careful and responsible rendition of some very poorly represented(now)days."
2,Amateur,"I've read lots of books on the biz. This one isn't the greatest, but it covers a lot of ground.Tons of misspellings. Strange. The funny thing is that even the author's note to his readers here at Amazon has some typos.The reviews already here hype the book way too much. It won't save your career, or get you signed. There's no way it would ever replace having a real manager. It might answer some questions you have about the music business, but that's about all.Good luck"
1,Are you kidding me?,"I live in NY and I never heard of this so-called band ""Last Tribe"" who he catapulted to stardom. Don't waste your time,instead, practice your instrument."
3,Basic and practical,"I am an industry professional who recently purchased All Area Access.This book is aimed toward the begining bands out there. It takes a step-by-step approach to explaining the various challenges that an up and coming band will face.Strangely enough, there are many typos and gramatical errors in the book. Even the illustrations appear to be incorrectly printed on the pages.If you are new to the business, this is a fine book to have in your collection. If you are looking for a more advanced explanation, I suggest getting Donald Passman's book, All You Need To Know About The Music Business.All in all, this is a very honest book, written by a very normal guy. It's a great place to start, but leaves a lot to be desired."
5,ALL AREA ACCESS Where would I be without it.,"ALL AREA ACCESS Who ever you are Mr. Davison, thank you for writing this book. I have purchased several books on the music business and much to my dismay I have found them to not only to be incomplete but they deal with subjects that do not apply to the daily experiences of struggling unsigned bands. ALL AREA ACCESS is the only book I have ever come across that is hands on and completely applicable to the day in and day out needs of a musician. It has opened me up to so many new avenues for my band including the college curcuit where I have just successfully booked a $1,000 event that never would have happened if it weren't for the book. I am forever grateful."
5,"solid, specific book","If this is your first band, buy this book. If you're in school and think you want to have a performing music career, buy this book. If you're midcareer, this book may also be useful. And if you want to become a manager but not sure how to start, buy this book. The main attraction for all readers is that it has very specific checklists that may seem insultingly simple, but are really helpful in keeping tasks organized and everyone's energy focused. It's worth the $-$ just for the sample worksheets, suggestions as to how to keep doormen honest, and other ""duh"" stuff, when you consider it will probably stop you from losing at least $ on your next gig. It may not get you a record deal, but it will help keep you from pulling out your hair during the day-to-day part of building an act."
2,Neil Was Almost Pathetic,"Could this guy have felt any more sorry for himself? He'd obviously led a staid and wasted life. And once the book was over I realized that very little actually happened in the story, there was not much of a plot. For what we got, it could have been cut in half."
2,Could Have Been MUCH Better!,I knew this story was in trouble when I had difficulty figuring out just who Neil Forbes was and what he looked like. This guy had little confidence in himself and he didn't make it easy for the reader to have confidence in him. What little excitement occurred was relegated to a few pages there at the end when Neil dealt with Reginald.
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I had high hopes for this book after reading The Black Knave, (and the 3rd book, The Diamond King), both of which were outstanding. Neil & Janet's story was too slow, and the events surrounding this story held little interest, maybe because Neil and Janet weren't that interesting.The Diamond King had numerous mistakes in it,which were distracting, but so did this one. Was there an editor anywhere?A man had just told Reginald that Braemoor 'is holding a ball in two days' time.' Yet in the same conversation, a moment later, Reginald says, 'There is a ball in three days' time.'I know it's trivial, but proper dialogue matters."
2,Not So Good...,"What a difference in this book than in The Diamond King & The Black Knave!!! Those were awesome stories but Neil's story was boring. Even the plot was nowhere near as intriguing or interesting as the other books. Come to think of it, there wasn't really much of a plot at all. If Neil had been a stronger hero maybe he could have carried off this subtle, slow story, but unfortunately, he wasn't. And Janet lacked enough personality to make it work."
3,Far from brilliant but pretty O.K.,"I liked the cd as a whole but some of the songs are EXTREMELY boring and unimaginative. Track 4 is a five and a half minute song of what seems to be a tribe chanting ""HA"" ""HA"" over and over again and in the back there are some drums that are beating the same way always. I cant understand how a DJ could put this on a cd. Maybe if he was playing it live it would be ok but if youre in your car it'll drive you crazy, and if youre listening to it at home even worse. Another track i disliked was track 5. Its supposed to be one of the highlights to the cd but i thought it was horrible. On the other hand tracks 9,11,and 12 are pretty good. What i really did like about this cd was the fact that it has a very unique sound and feel to it. It really is different than most of the rest cds coming out. Give it a try, maybe you will like it. Its all a matter of tastes."
5,He answers just like he writes,"Let's face it: If you like Bukowski (Hank, for those who really adore him), nothing is too much. You probably have already read ""Bukowski - A Life"" (by Neeli Cherkovski) and most of his books and, if like him like I do, you have read them all several times. And, every time you finish one of his books, you say to yourself: ""I want more!"" Well, now you got it! Fernanda Pivano asks the right questions, and Hank answers them, just like he wrote his best books. Sometimes, he's funny. Sometimes, he's mean. Sometimes, he's sincere. But, always, you have truth. His truth, at least. So, buy this book, buy some beers and read it. You'll have just one problem: You'll want more."
3,hanging with hank,interesting quick read about a foreign journalist's interview experience with bukowski not great but interesting
2,nothing special,"I do not quite understand why this should be a recommended Buk-Book. It is a fairly interesting interview, alright. But if you're going to spend money on Bukowski: buy HIS books. And if you want biographical information, go with Howard Sounes. To get a real good look on Bukowski you also might want to check out the 'Bukowski-Tapes' - Film-Interviews by Barbet Schroeder. Pivano's Interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money."
5,great!,"It is a great book! Fun to read, exciting to the end - it's got everything a great book ough to have."
4,Abfab in Singapore!,"If you want to enjoy a hilarious ride through modern day Singapore, seen through the eyes of three up-to-date singles, go ahead and read this book. Sophisticated humour is combined with slapstick situations, much like the Absolutely Fabulous TV-series has done for the English style-conscious classes. In this series of well-rounded vignettes Jason Hahn shares an apartment with two single women who combine sarcastic wit with an impeccable taste in shopping (not necessarily in one person). These tales are unique in that they convey a glimpse into the otherwise hidden world of young singles in Singapore and how they combine work and pleasure (leading up to a climactic kiss between Saffy and her boss - oops, I have given away the plot...). Now we just have to wait for the sequel and the television series..."
3,Humorous Account,"I'm sure most of the incidents are fabricated but I love them! Jason Hahn is hilarious and I burst out laughing many a time that people around me thought I was mad. This is one of the funniest book I've read in a while.However, there are several glaring grammatical mistakes which ought eradicated with careful proof-reading.If you're looking for high-brow artistic book, do not get this because it has no whatsoever artistic value in it.But if you want to know about two bimbotic girls and their (male) roommate, coupled with laughter aplenty, you may want to consider buying this book.Not bad for a Singaporean writer, I may add."
1,I read the instructions but still it does not work,"Tried to get it to work with mac os x, but intermittent results. seems to drop the connection a lot. belkin tech support was of no help. Google this product for more information on mac compatibility.Tried on my wife's windows xp box, and same poor result. Back it goes."
1,Garbage,"I purchased this but could never even get it to work. That's because it has no support for Vista, only Windows XP. I moved it to an XP machine, and after finally getting it ""working,"" found out that the range is not the advertised 30 feet, but closer to 4 feet. That's right, I couldn't get anything over 4-6 feet to work with the hub.The hub also feels cheaply made and not worth the currently advertised price. Stay away from this product at all costs."
1,Doesn't work - dropped connections,"Constantly dropped connections. Quality very low. Do not buy. It's a cool idea, but it just doesn't work."
1,Belkin = garbage,"Belkin products are garbage. Hardy even worth the effort when you used to get them free after rebate at Circuit City. (Oh the good old days...) Also, they paid people to write fake good reviews, so you can only trust the bad reviews.[..]"
1,DOESN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS 7 AT ALL!!! Total crap!!,"Won't work in any way shape or form with Windows 7. No idea about any other systems, sorry. Was a total and complete waste of my money."
3,"Ok, but...","This seems like it would be an awesome product, but doesn't work with WIN 7. Calls to the IO support line weren't really helpful, either (but I may have just gotten a person having a bad day). Other than that, it seems like a good enough product -- I just can't tell, since it only works on my computer as a wired-in 4-port hub."
2,Belkin F5U301 wireless USB Hub,"Pretty much a waste of money. Has to have special wireless dongle - not standard 802.11X. Realistic range 10-12 feet, not the 30 ft claimed. Won't work with the majority of USB devices I have tried. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Best kept secret in accounting,"It's now obsolete...or is it? I use it on Windows XP and Windows ME computers (don't want to spend the money on Windows 7). It works great. Here's the thing. You can buy a lot of different accounting programs out there. But Peachtree actually TEACHES you REAL accounting...it is not a toy...it doesn't try to ""hide the complicated stuff"". It will take some time and effort for you to learn it. But it will be worth the effort because 5 years from now it will still do everything you need. If you HAVE TO HAVE the latest and greatest...then go ahead and get Peachtree 2011. But if you are still using windows 98 or me or xp...Peachtree 2006 is the last version that will work on those systems. Another option is the free Peachtree version...but that does leave out many features. However, even the free version of Peachtree is better than free versions from other products...it doesn't limit number of customers or surprise you with other limitations."
5,Excelent Buy,"We was looking for an Accounting Package for our business, and we find Peachtree Accounting 2006 that is great for our use. We currently using to carry the accounting of our business. We reccmmend it"
5,A must for your desert island collection.,"I watched Lonnie Mack play in a bar in Cincinnati, Ohio when I was fifteen years old. He was great then and he is even greater on this album. Attack of The Killer V ranks as one of the best live albums ever recorded. The only complaint I have it is not long enough."
2,EXCELLENT POTENTIAL - NEEDS REMASTERING,"Lonnie Mack's live recording of Live-Attack of the Killer V has a great deal of potential. Lonnie's guitar playing is masterful with plenty of extended guitar solos. His singing voice is also powerful and pleasing to the ear. The songs themselves are all enjoyable. The fifth track, Satisfy Suzie, is particularly compelling. Live-Attack of the Killer V could be an outstanding cd. The single but great big problem with Live-Attack of the Killer V is that THE CD IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF REMASTERING. Such remastering would much more clearly accentuate and separate every note, tone, vocal, and guitar part in each and every song so that the listener would be riveted to the music while the cd is playing. As it currently stands, without remastering, all parts of each song on Live-Attack of the Killer V sound fuzzy, far away, and not clearly separated from one another. Hence the cd ends up being a disappointment that could sound so much better.John"
4,Lonnie Mack Rocks The House,"Live Blues / Rock from one of America's best guitar slingers and the King of Tone & Whammy, Lonnie Mack. My only complaint is that at 8 cuts, it ""ain't"" nearly long enough! Someone please talk Lonnie into coming out of semi-retirement to give us ""Part 2""!"
5,One of Preston's masterpieces,"I'm a devout Preston Sturges fan -- I love all his films, especially ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" and ""Christmas in July"" -- his films have no villains -- plot complications arise from misunderstandings, almost never from deliberate villainy or cruelty -- however, in ""The Lady Eve"" the scene on the honeymoon train trip when Stanwyck humiliates Fonda makes me squirm a bit -- she wants to get revenge and teach him a lesson, but the cruel way she does it is unusual for a Sturges film."
1,Now Playing In Satan's Multiplex ---,"The most tortuously unfunny comedy before the advent of Jerry Lewis. Henry Fonda proves that he has absolutely no sense of comedy whatever. Not a single laugh to be had in this monstrosity, which has somehow gained classic status. A complete and total waste of time. Watch The Palm Beach Story to see what Preston Sturges could do when he was rolling. Avoid this one."
5,What a wonderful film,"The Bottom Line:The film which convinced me that screwball comedies could create actual characters, movies from the 40s could make me laugh out loud, and Barbara Stanwyck was someone I would have wanted to go on a date with, The Lady Eve is nothing but fun through and through while still managing to make you care for the characters and hope they find happiness together at the end; a delightful picture, it has lost nothing of its charm since its release.3.5/4"
5,The Lady Eve,"Preston Sturges' crazy genius jumps off the screen in this movie. Originally a writer, he had an off-the-wall sensibility way ahead of his time. Barbara Stanwyck is at the peak of her appeal here, and Coburn is incongruously cuddly as her wily father. Fonda, of all people, is a hoot in a rare comedic turn."
4,"Great film, good DVD.","I love The Lady Eve, mostly because I am a fan of Barbara Stanwyck, but also because this is a great movie with lots of humor, good timing, great characters and good lines. The DVD has tons of extras, including production photos, the movie trailer, radio theater adaption, a great introduction by writer-director Peter Bogdanovich and a somewhat lame audio commentary by a film scholar Marian Keane who seems to find symbols in everything."
1,Excruciating. Torture. Sheer agony.,"This is one of those movies that has acquired a reputation as a ""classic."" If Mark Twain's dictum that a classic is a book that people praise but don't read applies to films, then this is truly a classic. No one who has the patience to sit through this painfully unfunny movie could possibly think of it as a classic. Henry Fonda, the most overrated actor in American cinema, shows that he has absolutely no flair for comedy. Barbara Stanwyck is rather more fortunate, but she is trapped is a script by the alleged genius Preston Sturges that just goes on and on and on and on, piling unfunny moment on top of unfunny moment, until the whole tedious mix collapses under its own weight. Do not see this movie. Avoid it like the plague. I sat through it no less than three times in various film classes in college. Finally the teachers had to withdraw it from circulation because students hated the damn thing so much. This is worse than not funny. It is downright unfunny."
5,VINTAGE COMEDY CLASSIC.,"Barbara Stanwyck is terrific as a lady card shark who first teases then falls in love with a professor of snakes (!) played by Henry Fonda. Stanwyck plays her role in a refreshingly modern way; her Jean is alternately cynical, tender, vulnerable, seductive and always believable.Charles Coburn is great as her con-artist Dad (he says to Jean: ""Let us be crooked but never common"" and when she falls for Fonda, Coburn laments ""Children don't respect their parents anymore"". The New York Times chose ""The Lady Eve"" as the best picture of 1941. This film proves that Stanwyck was more versatile than is generally remembered (she's better known for her hard-boiled characterizations)."
4,Barbara Stanwyck - what an actress!,Barbara Stanwyck was an outstanding dramatic actress. In this movie she showed she was also very good at comedy.
4,The Easters & Lewis Families Unite,It is wonderful to have a DVD that features both The Lewis Family and the Easter Brothers. It is sad that Polly had dementia by the time this DVD was recorded.
3,"Really cute, but little hard","It's not very soft and the two elephants are attached, so it's not a toy for little kids."
3,"Pretty good, but salty","The flavor is not bad, it's just that it's so salty. I wish there were a way to leave out some of the seasoning. Lots of dehydrated veggies in there - carrots, peas, corn, beans, green beans, and some lentils.My recommendation is to let it sit for more like 10 minutes after you put in the boiling water. Otherwise, the beans will still be hard. Give it a good stir in the middle though. Also, more time gives the couscous a chance to absorb more water so the cup will be more couscous and less watery."
2,Tastes good but...,"I do like the taste of this soup and enjoy the somewhat spicy ""kick."" And the price is not bad. But the contents of the soup do not fully ""cook"" when prepared as instructed. Even after letting the soup sit tightly covered for 10 minutes, I still find that the vegetable pieces are somewhat hard. I am going to try emptying the soup container contents into a bowl after the ""cook"" period and microwave it and see if this corrects the issue. But this will make preparation more complicated at work (I bought this product to keep at work)."
5,This is some really fine Blues......,"I discovered Katie after reading the reviews of many others.Great Blues singers of now are hard to find Katie sure gives her all.She is a Incredible WOW!!A Really great female blues singer, , I have really enjoyed her talent even though I have had her CD but a short time,She is a Keeper.......A real Find....Buy it , you will love it...."
1,"OUCH!!!! This is SCARY, it's so bad!!","The completely out-of-tune vocals only add to the confusion of Manny Albam's Gil-Evansesque retread arrangements and Joe's ""improvisation"" - this is ANTI-music!! They should have taken more that 2 days to record this - maybe they might have rethought a few things and come up with something worth listening to?!!"
3,...not just flat sound...is MONO recording,"Most has been written by previous rewiewers, but if I'm not wrong, no one realized and/or noticed this crucial aspect.To me , sound and recording quality is always a very important standard to consider before buying a cd..... and here we have tracks 1 to 7 originally issued as ""The Montgomery Brothers and five others"" , RECORDED in MONO...!!!!I really would have known this before...hope be useful for next one"
2,Not a Wes Montgomery album,"This should be called a Buddy Montgomery album since he's playing vides all over it. You can faintly hear Wes playing chords in the background, and he plays a full guitar solo only on a handful of songs. This is the reason why I rate this two stars. Otherwise it's a good jazz record played by great musicians.If you are a jazz guitar fan who appreciates Wes Montgomery, then this record is not worth your time or your money."
5,Love This /Coffee,I had been purchasing whole bean coffee in the supermarket but the price has been getting crazy. We like to grind and brew fresh coffee in the morrning and were reluctant to switch to something else. Saw this coffee on Amazon and ordered a bag to try. We now get it automatically delivered and enjoy our coffee every morning. The price is great too.
2,One of his least interesting albums.,"While any Otis Rush effort will always include fine guitar work and great singing, Lost in the Blues is one of his least interesting albums. First time listeners would be better off going directly to the Cobra material which includes some of the finest blues ever recorded or either of his two most recent recordings. Lost in the Blues is a downer for Rush fans on all scores. Alligator Records' lack of respect for Otis in the release ought to motivate blues fans to turn elsewhere."
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: IF YOU LIKE YOUR BLUES MELLOW, THIS CD BY OTIS IS FOR YOU.""","As ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", if I could summarize the categories of blues aficionado's, I would put them into 3 main groups. 1) Acoustic (Not for Shaq.) 2) mellow (Shaq likes some.) 3) string bending, thundering, lightning, earthquaking, TIDAL WAVE, soul shaking, guttural, blues! (My favorite type!) This CD by Otis, is definitely ""mellow"". I rate it 3 stars, but if ""mellow"" blues is your style, it would probably be a 4. This CD is reminiscent to me, of BB's ""Blues on the Bayou"". (See previous Shaq review.) SUMMARY: If you want to mellow out, this CD is for you. If you want to shake yourself up, this is not for you. Hoo! Haa!"
1,How?,"I would love to review this item, but since it has not been sent to me, I cannot. I am very displeased with this situation."
1,1982 DVD PROD SUCKS!!!,"If you thought TV commercials were loud, then you need to listen to this DVD.I was trying to watch early morning with volume turned way down.Whomever did the sound track over amplified the sound.BOO!You woke up my household.:(I watched the first five minutes & was bored.There are a lot better foreign movies out there."
4,Good Information But Could Be Better,Dr. Veltheim shows in his book only some of what BodyTalk can do. In order to really get the most out of it one must take an expensive class and buy more books...BodyTalk really is the most powerful holistic practice I have seen and research on this type of information is my business.
3,The Body Talk system,"With concerns about the future availability of any health care and its self care potential, this modality has some value. However its similarity prompted me to talk with a neurolink professional. He said there is much similarity based on efforts by Body Talk to create its own system through information in neurolink workshops. As a result lawsuits have been filed and the matter is now in litigation. It will be years before this matter is settled. Additionally no forms of recording are now allowed at neurolink seminars. Meanwhile neurolink continues to evolve with new and deeper approaches to health challenges. Finally and to my knowledge the treatment costs favor neurolink. Body Tall System offers limited self help while a superior and evolving system is available.Body Talk system is a fast horse deemed to finish last."
2,Poor engineering for a laser pen,"I ordered the laser pointer with the on & off switch, thinking that would be a nice feature. But I soon discovered it is not well designed and I returned it for a model with no switch, other than a button you press and hold. The problem is that the on/off switch draws power ALL THE TIME, regardless of which position it is in. You have to remove the batteries when the pointer is not in use. How stupid! Why should a switch draw power when it is in the off position?"
3,It was interesting but not what I expected.,It's okay. Nothing special. I don't know what else to say about it. I don't think I would recommend it to someone else.
3,Too Creepy,"I like mysteries, and enjoyed this one, but it got to be too creepy for my taste. I was reading it at night... But still, this book was more than bargained for."
3,It was o k,"So, it wasn't as great as the other novels. It felt like it dragged on a bit and took me longer to finish."
4,Good Book,The writing was very good. Different from the movie. Overall quite enjoyable. I have to write four more (extra) words.
3,A good read,"Good story. Not the best Bond I've read so far, but enjoyable escapist fare. I was surprised at how close the movie stuck to the plot...with one important difference. In the book, Honey Ryder is only about 15 or 16 years old. Bond agonizes over that issue right until the end and then, well James will be James."
2,Dr No,"Ian Fleming at his best is the best, but this book is quite poor. Only this one and Live and Let Die are inferior to the film versions, in my opinion. Fleming's writing itself is superb as ever, but the plot here is weak, as though he is making it up as he goes along. Particularly bad is the scene with Honey and Bond half way through the novel, which is really corny. And you wonder why a trained spy would go so close to the mechanical dragon that he is in the line of its flames. Surely, he would have kept himself hidden at that point?! The desciptions of Jamaica and Quarrel's character are good, but the whole thing lack any real suspense."
5,A Window into the Past,"Like all of Ian Fleming's novels, this book is vastly superior to the movie of the same name. James Bond is much more realistic as his closest escapes come from his cunning not a crazy gadget. He is more lifelike and easier to relate to than the megastud actuion hero of the movies. The plot is tautly woven, and the mystery begins on the first pages with the murder of Strangways. Fleming shoves a lot of information the reader's way, and it is up to you to decide what you believe at the final encounter. Doctor No is also great because it was written in 1958. Its Jamaica is one still part of Britain and untouched by tourism. Nearby Cuba is a friendly nation, and all James needs is a trusty gun and a beautiful girl. There were problems then, but they were much simpler than those of today, and it is refreshing to read about them"
4,A good tropical thriller for 007,"James Bond's return to Jamaica results in another diverting adventure as he investigates the mysterious disappearance of two agents. Bond finds himself in danger almost immediately after touching down in Kingston and soon focuses on an isolated island owned by a madman, a controlling mastermind who holds everyone in his domain in a grip of terror. Bond happens upon a lovely girl on the island whom he unwittingly puts at risk, and here is where the fun begins. Bond and his ladyfriend must find a way to avoid a horrible fate that the mad doctor has planned for them. This Bond yarn is a solid page-turner."
2,WORST OF 007,"Why do all you love that damned book? The plot, I think, is very far fetched (only Goldfinger's is farer); the return to Jamaica is simply a rewrite from ""Live and let die"". And the fight between Bond and the octopus is just TRASH! Well, the heroine seems to be beautiful..."
4,Dr NO is still Number ONE,"The basic frame of all the James Bond books and movies. It was the book chosen by the owners of the film rights to introduce the character to the screen - and they kept rather close to the essentials ... the tough but sophisticated Bond, the alluring female lead who becomes his companion and usually savior, the gruff but proud M and so on. Probably the best example of the movie being as good as the book - certainly not true of the later cartoonish movies which are seldom as good as the original Fleming stories."
4,Another solid novel with great descriptions of Jamaica,Fleming easily delivers here with a novel that is action packed and development of characters and location...he lived in Jamaica and reading of the lifestyle there makes you wish that life was like that now - not commercial.
3,performance date?,"I've only heard the samples here, so no added opinion on the performance or recording quality. Just thought it was pertinant to add that Jeff Carp is listed as the harmonica player. Carp's career was beteeen '68 and his death january '73, w/ not much in '72. Thus it's reasonable to date this between '68 and '71."
3,not what I expected,"Just received the Medi-Paw boot in a size ""collie"" and was amazed that it is sized for a small horse (1 paw for the price). I wanted something lighter and waterproof besides the the durable boots I just received (4 paws for the price). Sorry, but with the 20% restock fee and the cost of return I will be donating this item to the vet clinic. Will make my own extra set this time."
5,Yet another great Marco release.,"This one is on Par with Extreme Drumming (My favourite drum DVD of all time.)Marco's playing has matured in this video and he is stronger than ever! He plays through many different styles of music with ease and makes them sound authentic. The bonus features has a commentary track for one of the solos which is quite interesting as he explains all the patterns and breaks down the sections of the solo.I got my copy personally signed by Marco on his website [...], be sure to pick up a copy of this incredible percussion experience!"
1,Don't Bother,"If you are looking for a good INSTRUCTIONAL video, this is NOT the DVD for you. If you are only interested in watching Marco do his thing in his weird & quirky way, then by all means spend your money."
4,The Uppity Blues Women Are Real,"This is legitimate blues music. The flavor and nuance is of course pro woman, but with a realistic and accepting bent. They find humor in the ironic life of women, while still extolling a womans right to her own thoughts, actions and performance of her own music. Any blues fan, or any fan of the right to self thought and determination, will positively enjoy, and maybe ""chair dance"" along with, this music."
3,A textbook purchase college.,I was not all that happy with this book. It was not a great read. the author does not take into account sentence structure and wrote some of the longest run-on sentences I have ever seen in my life. My professors scold me for doing this so I'm not sure how a PhD can get away with this. Even our professor admitted that he was not all that pleased with this book but that there really are not a lot of great options when it comes to acquiring a text for an introductory class about globalization.I did not keep this book after class. I sold it back.
4,Great from cover to cover,"A master journalist who touches on the human side of events, Galeano's work is something that should be read by all. Having seen and experienced a broad array of interviews, trips, events and even exile, he reaches out in the great narrative tradition of Hemingway or Mailer and covers the topics that should have been covered in a part of the world so very undercovered in the past.Galeano starts off strong and ends on the same note-- to relay the voices seldom heard but that continue to shout, ""No!""-- accounting everything from the Uruguayan Symbol of Evil to the Favelas of Rio de Janiero to his letters addressing Chile and Cuba that finish this work.This is a work to describe an two continents of feeling, savagery and sorrow, but never lacking life. I highly recommend you pick up 'Nosotros decimos no', in English or Spanish!"
3,Barely a romance book,"This book was well-written with lots of character development - too much, actually. However, when I read a romance book, I want, well, romance! The two lovebirds don't even kiss until halfway through the book, and they never have sex (although it's alluded to at the end). When you have so much sensual tension and build-up, it's really disappointing when it culminates in a few passionate smooches and a ""real wedding night"" on the very last page of the book! What a letdown!"
2,A good beginning that slowly grinds its way through.,"I like Dallas Schulze, but this story left me wanting more. The main characters didn't really know each other but for a few weeks and the marriage didn't happen until about three-quarters of the way through the book. The heroine's family seemed a bit one-dimensional; the sister was a witch in tight jeans and the mother was a flake, but the author never really gets into what shaped their personalities. The synopis alludes to the hero needing a wife in order to inherit and meddling relatives, but the story wasn't really like that and the love scene was non-existent. I'll continue to read Dallas Schulze, but if you like a good marriage-of-convenience book, try THE VOW."
3,Not the best or the Worst,"This book contained a lot of valuable information and insight but was poorly edited and at times annoying. I also felt that Dr. Fieve was labeling people who were Bipolar I, Bipoloar II. Anytime the illness affects your daily routine, job, or family in such a way as to cause those around you discomfort, it is more than hypomania, it is manic. I also feel that Dr. Fieve gave too much criticism to psychotherapy, and no, I'm not a therapists. The points that Dr. Fieve critisized pertaining to therapy may not be the therapy that that particular therapists engages in. The therapist may use an entirely different approach, such as education of the disorder and coping mechanism instead of digging in a person childhood. I really believed that Dr. Fieve should have researched different types of psychotherapy prior to passing judgement and making blanket statements."
4,I THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK ON MOOD DISORDERS.,"It was published in 1997 so it isn't the most recent of books however it is a good resourse. I didn't find it to ""techy"" to read. Also it is so important to understand your illness that if you run across concepts or words that you aren't familier with it is really important to familierize yourself with them for your own knowledge. Knowledge is power in managing your own health (and your own healthcare)"
3,Helpful and Informative,"I recommend this book to anybody that struggles with mood swings. My LCSW recommended that I read it. At first, it might sound like some sort of paid promo for a drug, but trust me, it's not. My LCSW also assured me that it wasn't."
2,simplistic and dull--read An Unquiet Mind,"I found this book to be simplistic for anyone who had any knowledge of bipolar illness. Lithium is not the answer for every moodswing, as the author contends. Read other material and save your money."
5,"Man,I dig 'Cheese Cake'","Like a countdown to a rocket launch,'Go' kicks off withButch Warren's bass and Billy Higgins on cymbals,setting up some serious kick ass blowin' by Dexter Gordon on his classic 'Cheese Cake', one of my all time favorite jazz numbers;my only complaint-as other reviewers have stated -is this classic cd's length-less than 40 minutes.In any case,Gordon considered 'Go' his best cd.Tragically,soon after this cd was recorded in 1962,Sonny Clark,the great pianist on this album would die of a heroin od at 31.And in 1986,Gordon,who should've recieved the Oscar for his portrayal of Dale Turner,an expatriate tenor sax player in 'Round Midnight' was ripped off for the Oscar in 'Round Midnight.'"
5,A hard-bop classic,"If you are a fan of ""Our Man in Paris"" I think you'll be thrilled with this equally intense session. A real over-looked find."
4,Good Music - not enough of it,Go Dexter Gordon. The music is most enjoyable but there is so little of it. I guess that's why it was a cheaper CD.
3,Looks nice but not well made,"Shells started falling off within a month of hanging, so is not very well made."
3,Interesting,"Although I found this book interesting, it was not what I was looking for. Just wish one could review more of book contents before purchase."
5,I am a new quilter,Well written and informative. I found many tips and the instructions make sense. Marti Mitchell is well known in the quilting world for a reason.
4,Good Buy for Price,"This may not be the 'best' hair setter on the market but, for occasional use, it works very well... gets the job done. Getting the rollers back in the set is a little awkward (has to be turned to fit in slot)and the 'large' rollers are more 'medium' in size compared to other sets. But, bottom line, I'm happy with this purchase."
3,"Tames frizzies, but not a long-lasting curl/wave","Curlers heat up fast but curls don't last all that long even on the high setting. If your hair isn't pristine clean, won't curl at all. It does, however, do a good job of taming frizzies."
4,MAY THE LORD IN HIS MERCY BE KIND TO BELFAST,"May the Lord in His Mercy Be Kind to Belfast is a compendium of voices, a record of Northern Irish lives from many walks of life, including priests, educators, students, soldiers, paramilitaries, prisoners and working people, speaking about the Northern Irish Troubles, now thankfully in the past.Even on the page, their voices resonate with a variety of emotion, from shock to complacency, from philosophy to urgency. Typical of people in that region, the speakers are often able to tell their story---often of a lost loved one or near-death experience---with a calm detachment that quietly reveals a shock reverberating at a very deep level within the speaker.An intimate look at individual sufferings of the Northern people, and the culture that was everyday life for them during the 30 years of the Troubles.- Caroline Oceana Ryan, author - AN OLD CASTLE STANDING ON A FORD: One Yank's Life in an Almost Peaceful Belfast (Eloquent Books, 2010)"
2,Not even interesting,"Schumann's symphonies are delicate things, as their raison d'etre is easily lost and then they become superfluous. That's what has happened here. It probably was not Harnoncourt's intention, but it sounds like he's conducting Schumann as if it were Beethoven.Where is Schumann in these recordings? Where is the romantic lyricism? Not here. This simply is not Schumann, and even then, i don't think the music works like this but sounds like 3rd rate Beethoven.This a shame. Harnoncourt's recordings of many Haydn symphonies are incredible - my favourites - and his Beethoven cycle is not only interesting but musically wonderful. But Schumann's sensitive romanticism eludes his grasp.Disappointed."
2,States the obvious; misses the less-obvious,"This 125-page commentary on Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" was written in 1988 by an English professor at McGill. Its points (except those quoted from other sources) are all obvious and it sometimes descends to the level of summary. It also dismisses every extreme point of view presented in the novel by saying that ""we"", of course, know that lack of moderation is silly: no argument or engagement is required. A very poor work."
5,Biblically sound Praise and Worship!,"All of Sovereign Grace's Albums are contemporary in style, yet Biblically sound! Their songs are like the hymns (solid theology). The voices and harmonies are beautiful! This is speaking for all of their music!"
4,Excellent Blues Rock from the late 60's,This is a very good rock/blues album from the end of the 60's. Excellent guitar too :) You can hear a lot of the era's influence in their music. I'd rate it 4 of 5 easily. Enjoy!
3,Hillow Hammet - 'Hammer' (Gear Fab),"Originally released in 1970, as this was the [virtually] unknown Washington, D.C.'s band only record. Best described psychedelic or heavy rock. Tunes here that I sort of liked were ""Slip Away"", the gritty rocker ""Home"", ""Brown Eyed Woman"", ""We Want To Be Free"" and the lp's closer - the seven-minute ""Oh Happy Day"". Nothing to get all excited about, but okay. Might appeal to fans of Moving Sidewalks, Thirteenth Floor Elevators and Steppenwolf."
4,An enjoyable read,"Some purists criticize Sandburg, but he tells a good story and has something to back him up even if his standards are looser than those used by some historians. This book's supplementary collection of correspondence from acquaintances of young Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln is valuable. Noted scholar Paul Angle collaborated with Sandburg on this volume."
5,One of the best albums in my collection of Crusaders stuff,"The cut ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" boasts of one of the most soul-full tenor sax solos by Wilton Felder. The trombone of Wayne Henderson is very smooth, too. ""Scratch"" is very upbeat. The way that Felder and Henderson play harmonys, and unisons, with one another is a Crusaders trademark sound. This ""sound"" is well presented on this album. ""Milestones"" and ""Doin' That Thing"" are also great cuts as are ""Blues Up Tight"" and ""Miss It"". On the whole one of their finest efforts. I recommend this album, and the Crusaders, to anyone and everyone who likes good jazz."
3,Swingin safe,Diversely snazzy old-school supper-house smoke music leaves a pleasant enough aftertaste to recommend for aficionados of the era.
2,Not so hot.,"I bought this CD after seeing Saffire live at the 2001 Mississippi Valley Blues Festival. Their set was dynamic, musically interesting and great fun to watch. However, this early recording fails to capture any of that excitement. There are too many tunes that sound too much alike. It's mostly one groove: uninspired blues riffs with not much going on lyrically except for repetitious sexual double entendres that aren't quite funny enough. I actually fell asleep listening to this. Save your money for a live performance or a more recent CD."
3,Another good Saffire album,"Saffire is three middle aged women who may be uppity, but they sure do know their blues history. They do blues standards mixed with (mostly) their own material, always with a sense of humor (""Pissin' on a Skunk"" is a good example). Before forming this group, one woman was a computer analyst & one was a music teacher. The problem is that at times, they play like a computer analyst & a music teacher! There are moments when ""by the numbers"" seems to overcome genuine feeling, & that's especially detrimental to this type of music. Sometimes the singing is too proficient & a note is carried too long; it's not quite rough & tough enough at spots. But it's always likable & it's truer to the blues than most of what's out there today."
3,Celebrate it for its camp contributions,"It is pretty weird that this gets the boxed set treatmemt, but hey, I'm not complaining. This was mondo bizare TV to be sure. This is from Fred Silverman-Era NBC. Silverman took the ""chuck- it-against-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks"" approach to TV programming and, here's just one of the results. (Others include BJ and the Seven Lady Truckers, SuperTrain, Brady Brides, Manimal...oh, I could go on and on, but its too painful.)PL and Jeff attempted to plug into the same kind of hipster vibe that Saturday Night Live and Don Kirschner's Rock Concert did. It failed, but it did give us a delicious sort of camp. Everybody's so earnest in trying to make it work and watching it is the best train wreck you'll over laugh yourself silly over."
1,Are you serious?,I actually really enjoyed this show (it was only a summer replacement series). But I'll be darned if I'll pay a rare books price for it.
1,Atrocious,"I fondly remembered watching the first episode of Pink Lady and Jeff when it first aired. So, I bought the dvd boxed set. I was a pre-teen when this abomination first aired, and I admit I had pretty lousy taste. So now I own this thing. I haven't been able to get through a whole episode yet because it is absolutely horrible. It might be fun to play in the background at a party, but it's physically painful to actually sit down and watch. Beware of those who say it's so bad that it's funny. It's so bad, it's worse than you can imagine."
1,Not worth it,"Hey, I love watching bad TV. I loved The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, I'll waste the occasional afternoon watching everything from Kroft Supershow to Diff'rent Strokes to Saved By The Bell. But I found this to be uninteresting and unwatchable.Jeff Altman's impression-based comedy is stale and uninspired, which I suppose is the point, but that only makes it sadder because he as a comic, unlike Donny and Marie, or the Brady Bunch actors, should've known better.If you love bad TV and 70's Variety Shows, pick up The Brady Bunch Variety Hour or the Kroft Supershow box set, and don't waste your money on this. It's not so-bad-its-funny, it's just bad."
3,"Nice wind chime, but bad packaging.................","Just got this shell wind chime, I chose it because that was the only sound that was missing from my collection. Unfortunatelly some oyster's shells came broken due to poor Amazon's protection.Fortunatelly I could piece them together with some super glue.I would have given it a 5 star rating."
5,Kick-butt BLUES,"Maurice does ""classical"" blues the way it needs to be played, in a perfect blend of hot guitar and vocals. His voice cuts rough when the song is brutal and flows mellow when the song embraces you. A 'must have' for a blues collector and lessons for the blues musician. Yeow!"
5,Killer Blues Album!,"Once in a while I bump into an album that is really worth the money. This album definetely is. Maurice is a fabulous singer, guitar and saxophone player. I wonder why he has done only two albums. This album is full of great songs and playing. Expecially Generic Blues and I Got Money are true blues classics. Buy This. (In The Shadow of the City is great too)."
1,Meh,"I have several of Don's books and have found them very helpful. ""Is There Life After Housework?"" changed the way I clean and has saved me countless hours of drudgery. This book, however, was quite disappointing. I have to say that I didn't get so much as one new tip/hint out of it, making it a big waste of time and money."
4,Dicks Picks Volume 3,I bought the cd used from Starlight Records. The disc is in good shape. It was shipped promptly even during the busy X-Mas season. I love those shows from 1977. I think that was the best sound the band had.
2,"I love the Dead, but.......","I just could not get into this particular show. I bought it when it was released however many yrs ago b/c the setlist looked pretty tight. However, there is just something about late-70's era Dead that doesn't measure up on the whole to previous phases in my mind. The music seems flaccid and lifeless during this show. I was hoping to get good versions of Estimated Prophet and the Terrapin suite to replace my old hissy concert tapes, but both cuts on this CD are pretty weak. I listened to it a couple of times and then put it back on my shelf, opting instead to return to my tapes. Bottom line: this is a good show to hold onto for posterity if you tend to be a completist like myself, however it can't touch some of the better Dick's Picks releases (i.e. VIII)."
5,Peaceful and Quiet,"This is the account of last days of Bhagavan. Mouni Sadhu's narration in a gentle pace lets you travel to that time and experience those last days in peace. He is a gentle soul, Mouni. I find the book to have the grounding effect on me whenever I read a chapter from it."
4,his best effort,"this is my favorite album from tinsley, the guitar solos are spot on and the songwriting is pretty solid"
5,game review,My kids loved this game when they played it about 5 years ago and were very happy when they found it on Amazon and could purchase it. It is a fun game.
2,Falling Star,"All,, i can say, after watching this video, is it left me brokenhearted. To watch such a superstar as Michael, literaly on the road to ruin was sad. His voice was shakey, his antics on stage were awful...it was like he didnt care or didnt know where he was. Sure, in the past he got crazy, but this was just very uncomfortable to watch..the audio was terrible and sometimes it sounded like a jumbled mess. Michael was a beautiful and very talented man being chased by too many deamons, including that witch Paula. I dont think i can re-watch this concert like i do Live Baby Live, its to painful. Im not comparing this DVD to just Live Baby Live, ive seen many concerts by INXS over the years and this was just wrong........."
3,Passable,"If you like your blues with the strained vocal element that Koko delivers, then this is probably more your style. There are some reasonable songs, but many of the tracks have horn filling which immediately says to me that the general sound lacks. Definitely yesterday's blues for me. Criss Johnson on guitar provides the best sounds on the album particularly on the opening track 'Can't let go'."
1,"I need to quit believing these reviews, sheesh this is awful","Are you kidding me? This is just terrible. these guys were sort of innovators in the beginning, but the problem is that music caught up and surpassed them by a long way. Now they are still treading water where they were years ago and the result is incredibly boring. Take some 5th grade guitar player rock riffs mix it with cheesy monophonic keyboard lines and you pretty much have trans am. At the end of their ""rock"" songs, they always pick one chord and just play it until you want to shoot yourself. The vocals are god awful, and the production is weak. I have no idea why the other people gave such good reviews of this record, they must be their friends or something.Trans Am are a one trick pony that got lucky.No sir, I don't like it. I want my money back."
4,sump pump,"the quality of the sump pump looks to be very good, I like the small handle on the top for easy pick up. The directions are straightforward. The directions mention to put a check valve as close to the pump as possible, but the only question I had was whether it is recommended to put a small hole in the PVC pipe below the check valve to prevent freeze ups, this was not mentioned in the directions. Overall, satisfied with the quality and hopefully it will perform well!"
2,"Just 2 years of intermittent service, then dead.","I was initially pleased with this pump. It worked fine for six months. Then it worked intermittenly- I would often find my cistern full of water even though the float was suspended upright. For months I would often have to jiggle the pump to get it to work. Now after just 2 years it's dead. I will replace it with a different brand. Update; after speaking with the manufacturing company, they agreed to replace the float which had apparently leaked water and shorted out. I appreciated the gesture but will probably use a different brand next time."
4,Sump pump a success.,I have installed the pump in my basement. Although it hasn't rained hard enough to flood the basement. I do believe it will be a great improvement to my home.
1,Sump Pump,"Hello, my pool pump box usually floods under heavy rain and the pumps often break - I bought this pump wondering that would solve my problems but in my opinion, it is very fragile and, worse, due to its system this pump does not pump all water ... leaving a large amount of ponded water"
5,Badke hits another home run...,"This update to Badke's previous work on library research is excellent. I teach Language and Research at a Bible college and used to use his first book as required reading for my students. I was so disappointed when it went out of print. Now, this updated version is my new requirement. This book is written with the same humor and simplicity as the first, but with updated information that is a must. Dealing with electronic research is now the norm and Badke explains it very, very well. This is a must have resource for anyone taking on research."
5,Helpful and humorous,"As an instructor myself, this book was extremely helpful. It neatly explains methods and resources for research. Not only that, it was amusing to read because of the author's humorous comments, a rare feat for such a dry topic."
5,"All the basics, with great writing","I'm an academic library paraprofessional who regularly teaches bibliographic instruction sessions to undergraduates, grad students, and even professors. While Badke does an excellent job explaining the tools used in library research, the material really stands out when he explains to readers how to think about research and how to form good questions. His prose is easy to read, and sometimes quite lively (which is exceptional for a volume on research practices), and he continually keeps the focus on how these strategies contribute to answering interesting questions.This is a great volume for beginning researchers or anyone who wants a ""refresher course."""
4,College text - easy reading,Informative - I'm sure there is research paper in my college future. I will be using this to help me along.Katcoo
4,Well written introduction to library research,A little dated but still very useful introduction to doing research using subscribed and open access content.
3,"Many, many typos",The book was pretty good but way too many typos. I also did not like the way it ended. (Review by Matthew Samaan)
2,Wanted to like it,got into the book really easily... then it got monotonous... then the ending seemed vague and out of nowhere.... unfortunately I have to say overall it has a lot more potential than actual...
5,"Susepenseful, addicting, and cliffhanging","This book is highly recommended by me and is absoulutely great! This book is about a young boy named Micheal (Mitty) who is in highschool going through adolesence. He is very lazy and a slack off type of person. But what happens when he has to do that biolioghy report on a human sickness? If he wants to stay in the same class as his crush, he has to do it. So when he discovers really old smallpox scabs, he decideds to do it on smallpox. Later on Mitty gets kidnapped by foreign people after sending e-mails to several people he thought could help him with what he thought he had...smallpox. This book is very addicting and exciting."
5,code orange,"This book has adventure, mystery, and humor. Mitty never did his homework, so why is all of a sudden is he hooked on his advanced biology assignment? Why is he asking himself could I get smallpox from 100-year-old scabs? It only takes seven days for a person to get affected and spread the deise. But Mitty goes missing Mitty didn't mean to or did he?This book is fiction, with some non-fiction. Code Orange is recommend for kids 11 and up, because there are some hard words. This book is great it draws you in. You can't stop thinking about the book. Caroline B. Convey has written many other great books such as; The Face on the Milk Carton, What Ever Happen To Jaine, The Voice On The Radio. My opinion of Code Orange it a great book. So go to your library and get the best book you will ever read."
1,BORING!!!!!!!,uhh this book was terrible. i really wish i could return it! the main idea was really stupid and weird. the charcters were messed up and the writing was worst of all ! lack in detail and twisted plot this book should get below one star! im verrrry disapointed. this author needs a writing lesson! pronto!!!!!
5,"It is not the book, but rather the company","I inadvertantly ordered $330 dollars worth of the subject book. When I realized my error I contacted Amazon and told them of the mistake and asked them to credit my account immediately. They could not do this of course although to my mind it was their convoluted site that caused me to order more than I wanted. I contacted the FTC but they were no more responsive than Amazon. At no time did I speak to anyone other than computer generated messages, a situation probably designed by the Amazon people. I stressed that I had returned the books and that it was a hardship to have over $330 paid out of my banking account--more computer generated responses. I am buying more books however, all from vendors other than Amazon."
2,Good,What i expected for this product. I am very satisfied with it and I have had no problems with it.
4,Not Just Another Jazz Piano Player,"Why isn't Geri Allen (born 1957) more famous? She has several CD's & has played with a lot of famous Jazz musicians: Steve Coleman, Charlie Haden, Paul Motian, & Cassandra Wilson to name a few. Is she too off the top like Cecile Taylor? No, she's not that weird, but at times her type of Jazz can be rather abstract, repetitive, or strong on the keys. One musical reviewer terms her as a Post-Bop, which I disagree. What really makes her music interesting & especially this CD is her multi styles that fade in & out of mainstream melodies. Another factor is this CD was done with great production that can reveal your stereo system's potential or use it as a test CD when purchasing new equipment. Give the 'Listen to Samples' a spin & see if it suits your fancy."
2,FRUSTRATED AS .....HECK!,"For about 5 ringtones after I bought this program it worked fine. All of a sudden I'm getting ""fatal errors"" and the program no longer works. Nothing on my computer has changed. I tried all of the tips on the Xingtone website but nothing is working. Looks like I'm going to have to give Magix a try.XINGTONE R.I.P"

4,Lock you daughters at home for Spring Break,"Wild, wet, and out of control is the best way to describe this voyeuristic vision of spring break. If your parents ever see this tape, then you will be spring breaking at the Grand Canyon with your grandparents. Also, if you were the type that stayed in the dorms and studied over spring break, then this tape will make you sorry that you never experienced one of college's worst kept secrets."
4,"LOVE the show, Like the DVD","I love the show, but i dont like that they keep splitting up the seasons for the dvds, but still a pretty good/great dvd"
5,best series out there,This is the best series out there going right now. only thing is this is only part one. Can not wait till part two comes out.
3,short order,Had to order 2 times. The 1st order arrived missing a boot. Yes we only received 1 boot. It is being returned. The 2nd order arrived with matching boots and they are just what my daughter wanted. So Thank You.
3,Good resource,This was a good resource for a person just beginning in the business. I expected more based on the review from the author however it is truly for a beginner not for one who has been out for several years. I did find the book to be well written and humourously written with great quotes and quips.
4,HELPFUL TIPS,"I found the book to be very helpful and inspiring to me. I'm just getting started with a band, and it has helped my outlook and my confidence."
3,Smaller than portrayed in photo,"This is a cute little bunny, and Folkmanis puppets are always a really good quality, but be warned that the puppet is much smaller than the photo portrays. I know it is a finger puppet, but it's really a FINGER puppet, and I don't know how they found such a tiny hand model!"
4,book,"A little hard to get into, but what I've read so far makes so much sense. I had a mother with borderline Personality, and never really knew what was wrong with her until now."
2,Borderline Personality more mystifying then before,"There were some things I got from this book that were helpful in the terms of understanding yourself better. The problem with this book is, it is very hard to understand the majority of the time. It is as though the only thing the author wanted to demystify was the title. I am an intelligent person who has read many a book on BPD, and there were many times I was confused and didnt feel at all like someone was helping me to understand something. Whatever good you get out of it is overshadowed by how hard it is trying to understand his medical jargon. Extremely complicated prose makes me wish I would have spent my money on something that would have been more helpful."
4,Exceptional information,"great collection of information, including history of the disorder and new medication strategies to apply. I think it's really terrific that there are finally some new meds to help! Very accessible language."
5,Great overview of BPD!,"As a social work student, I was looking for comprehensive, easily accessible information about Borderline Personality Disorder - this book filled the bill! Highly recommended to new practitioners and lay people alike."
4,Authoritative Book On BPD,"This is an excellent book on BPD written by a genuine expert on the subject - not some self-appointed guru.The book begins by defining what BPD is and how it is diagnosed. A table of diagnostic criteria is provided. The book then ventures into the history and causes of BPD. It then gets a little ""academic"" with chapters on the mechanism of the disease. This part will prove very intersting to curious readers who want all the details. For the easy readers, it may seem a bit wordy and technical. The best thing about this book is that it only gives the readers the facts.The final chapters deal with the key elements of treatment, medications and therapy. The book ends on a positive note with plenty of advice on how to cope if a loved one suffers from BPD. Not too much specifics on coping with BPD, but definitely good recommendations for positive paths and directions to take."
3,Just OK,"I have been diagnosed and treated for BPD for nearly 10 years. I have yet to find more than a couple of really good books on the subject. Of course, I have not read them all...but many of them. BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER DEMYSTIFIED..., was just OK. I found only a few excerpts that I could actually identify with. The book did not flow well for me..I was bored, and kept jumping around to find something really interesting. I would not recommend this book unless you just want to read everything you can find about BPD. There are better ones available. One of the best that I have read is ""I HATE YOU, DON'T LEAVE ME""."
4,Straightforward and Helpful,"This book doesn't overwhelm you with a lot of jargon or ""psycobable"", just honest and useful information written by someone who obviously cares about the subject. This is sort of a ""primer"" on BPD that anyone newly diagnosed (or a family member) will find useful. There is even a special section for family and friends to help them understand and deal with their BPD loved one."
5,I learned about music at age 13 from this album!,"This is one of the greatest sounds ever caught on tape(analog!!!!!!). After all these years, it still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, listning to the greatest drummer of all time."
5,One of the best big band albums ever,"I never get tired of listening to this CD, and what a bonus you get on the CD vs. the LP-- lots of additional music. If I had to pick two big band CD's to listen to, this would be one of them. The other would be Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band ""Swinging for the fences"".This band is tight and talented. It's a must for any serious collection."
4,lovely Bi-Continental Historical Romance.....,"Heartwarming romance with a hero and heroine who are good people-no courtesans or rakes here-just two decent people who've been hurt in the past and must learn to love and trust.The story starts in England, travels to America, spends a great deal onboard a ship, to finally end back in England. Mild bedroom scenes, a formulaic but interesting mystery, and lot's of familiar relationships abound.If you are a fan of ""nicer"" or Christian romances, but without the religious aspect, then you'll enjoy this book.4 stars."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I have a large room on a lower floor that is always freezing. The mats really help. They do the job unless it's really cold and then I need a space heater as well. But it does a great job and exactly what I was looking for, I have 2 under a big rug."
4,Rugbuddy,"I bought this rug heater to help with keeping a more constant heat in my poorly insulated living room. The first week I had it the temperature outside was in the 30's, which meant that without heat, my house was getting down into the 30's and 40's. The rugbuddy alone didn't seem to make a dent on the low temperatures inside, but used with a small space heater (oil radiator), the room heats up noticeably faster and stays warm with the space heater on a lower setting. Now the temperatures outside are in the 40's and 50's and the rugbuddy alone does a great job in maintaining a comfortable temperature inside.As other reviewers have noted, the rugbuddy is a favorite of my cats and my 3 year old daughter. On particularly cool evenings, I've set up camp on the rugbuddy to watch movies with a light blanket and it's very cozy!"
1,beware...,"The brondell is very good but it doesn't always deliver on its promise. The hot water heater breaksand the pulsator does not function. Beware most reviews are written shortly after delivery, when the machine is new. I am reviewing this after five months of use.Amazon is great and makes returning an item very easy."
2,Caveat emptor,"Ever see a slew of glowing, gushing, reviews and thought, ""wow, the writing is so similar amongst all these reviewers!""Then you click on their names, and just about all of them have only reviewed either this product, or some other Brondell toilet seat?Bigtime shill reviews. Beware!"
1,If I were running the world...,"I would sentence anyone insensitive enough to sport this bumpersticker with 90 days working in a soup kitchen and with having to read and review Nickled and Dimed by Barbara Ehrenreich.I've known middle income people who became low income by a sudden health crisis and/or job loss. I've also known wealthy people who became low income by misfortunes such as having their store go out of business or finding out their business partner was a criminal. I've also seen divorce dramatically lower people's standards of living. Being low income in our society is really one of those ""there but for the grace of God go I"" circumstances. If you have money, one way to hold on to it is by avoiding foolish purchases such as this one."
4,nice squiter device,the model is great easy install squit device was great added bonus well worth the price and looks on my double sink
1,Kitchen Faucet = Shower,"I just purchased and installed this faucet and with that I would have rated it 5 stars. Then my wife went to turn it on to test and the faucet sends water all over instead of just straight down. I thought it was the aerator so I cleaned, inspected, reassembled and tried again. No luck.... It is very disappointing that you really can't test water flow in the store<vbg>.I will probably try another aerator before taking the unit out and replacing it with another brand. I also submitted my problem to PP to see what they say. I have had Kohler with not great results so I tried a PP. Not recommended at all."
2,Don't waste your money,"Very poor quality dvd. Audio is lousy, video is not much better. They must have made this dvd from a poor quality vhs tape. Not worth the price."
4,Capone,This movie is not the most accurate. However it is a classic to me. I used to watch it on TV back in the 1980's. I like it better than some of the modern gangster films today.
1,Francis in a sand storm,"If you ever wanted to hear Frank sing in a sand storm, this is your opportunity. The sound quality is so bad it's distracting. If you want to hear him before the bravado of that 'ring-a-ding' sound took hold of his life, get the ""Live in Paris"""
5,they have done it again,The four beautiful sisters of sparx have done it again. They have made another hit record. This new c.d. no hay otro amor is full of different music styles. It is a must have if your a sparx fan. I highly reccomend it.
5,Thanks Amazon for coming to the rescue,It's a darn shame that keyboard manufacturers don't sell their keyboards with this piece anymore. I'm a tech with a PS2 style KVM switch for the keyboard and mouse. Thanks amazon for having this. It was excatly what I needed.
5,PS2 Male to USB Female A Adapter,"Adapter worked as described, with these things they either work or they don't and the majority of the time they do!! I used it with my new DVI KVM switch and it worked great!!"
1,"USB A Female to MiniDin6 (PS/2) Male, Adaptor (Purple)",Doesn't Work on my wired keyboard... I used one before that worked fine but I lost. should be simple enough...
5,Caring for aging parents,This book is a must read for anyone caring for aging parents.It is a great source of support and understanding during troublesome and frustrating times.
5,"Great Content, Important Read","An Editor's Guide to Perfect Press Releases.: The Key To Free Publicity For Your Organization or BusinessJudy's book is an important read, especially for the boomer generation that can often be taking care of parents, grown children... and grandchildren. The difference in perspective between the generations is well explained, with heart-felt words well-crafted by an expert author, journalist and columnist. Kudos, Judy- Job well done!Penny Fletcher/ Author & Talk-show hostSoft News"
1,Cageed combat,I bought this dvd under the impression that it was a briliant and brutal event but only the brutal part was true it is a complete waste of money and I couldn't reccomend it to anybody eeeeeever!
4,Lucky twice makes me feel so lucky,"I love the first and third song, the second one is so ordinary. I always put on this CD to make myself feel good and feel lucky of what I have. Lucky is now my theme song."
3,Visually Delightful,"Want to be challenged and take your mind off real life for a while? This isn't your film, it requires no mental capacity. However, if you enjoy the female form this film provides the visual imagery."
2,Naked Japanese chick,I like asain women and this woman is pretty. The video is not from the U.S.A so it is a bit different. It is just Kei Mizutani running around naked. There are really no good close ups and Penthouse and some other companies have made better nude modeling videos.
2,Beautiful soft girl but not a movie,If you r looking for an erotic movie don't buy this one. It is only a strip show. the two stars are for the beautiful soft girl.
5,The King of Dub,"U Roy was the first and greatest DJ/dub-artist of the roots-dub-reggae era. Under the general umbrella of Jamaican reggae he was truly the King, second only to Bob Marley. ""Rasta Ambassador"" is probably his best-mixed and tightest work I have yet discovered. U Roy's dub cadences are hypnotic and when paired with the steady-yet-trippy, bass-heavy reggae riddms it becomes almost its own genre. I might call it ""Space-reggae."" U Roy presented a rhythmic style of dub that others who mimicked didn't seem to fully understand. When his howls and chants seem odd and out-of-place he then drops into a pocket of clever, mellow vocal percussion that plays masterfully against the tapestry of reggae power behind him. ""Rasta Ambassador"" is full of jewels, my personal favorite being ""The Tide Is High."" Get hooked on U Roy. It's well worth the ride."
2,Teaxas Angel?,"No offense, but are all the reviewers of this book blind? This was a BORING book. I could barely get through the first half of the book, it picked up a little bit after that, but not much. One of the main characters, Elise, seemed stupid to me. Trying to escape with a screaming child? Excuse me, but it seems like common sense to shut the child up and then run. I was surprised that the author, Judith Pella, was a bestselling athor. Because this is definitly not one of my favorites. Then I thought maybe this was one of her not so great books, I mean all authors have those. But after reading all of these reviews, I'm not quite sure. The author ended the book too quickly. It was as if she was just trying to tie all the loose ends up, instead of actully thinking it through. Overall, I would NOT recommend thiS book. Don't waste your time on it."
4,Enjoyable Romance!,This was probably one of Judith Pella's best books yet. I am looking forward to reading the sequel. I enjoyed watching the transformation of the characters. Each of them went through major personality and attitude changes especially Benjamin. I do recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian romances with substance.
4,Like it!,"Love this CD. I bought for 1 particular song, but as I listened to it, I like all of it! I very rarely purchase used products online, but I did with this cd. It is in perfect condition except for the plastic case. The hinge is broken. The seller could have easily put it in one that was not."
4,Great book on ARGs,"This is Not a Game is an interesting take on the ARG/Transmedia genre's early years (1999-2005ish) from the perspective of a player turned independent ARG designer. While not exactly encyclopedic and covering every game from that time period, it does a good job of looking at the early foundations and some of the big names as well as their aftermath and a case study of a couple indie-games that came afterwards. Its a great into to people new to the genre, that may have missed The Beast, Majestic, and any others from that time period."
5,Most delicious lotion I've ever used,This stuff smells beyond amazing... I seriously sit at work all day and just smell my hands... I can't get enough. Their body scrub is incredible as well.
5,"Best smelling, longest lasting lotion EVER!","I've tried a LOT of lotions in my life... but this is by far the best. I've only tried the Vanilla Bean... but it is absolutely, insanely delicious. I sit at work and literally smell my hands all day, I can't get enough. And even after one application in the morning, I'll still smell it in bed that night. The scent lasts forever, I've never seen anything like it! I wish they had a retail store near me so I could go in and smell everything in person... it would be heaven!One thing I should note is that a couple of my coworkers have mentioned my cubicle smells like syrup, but I disagree... their noses must be broken. It does have a very warm, rich and sweet vanilla smell... but nothing like a nasty syrup smell, Ew."
2,*sigh*...,"Don't get me wrong, I *love* the original Wayne's World. But WW2 suffers from a classic case of sequelitis: 90% of it is a tired retread of the humor from WW, without the freshness that made WW so brilliant. Of course, that other 10% is worth seeing (in fact, it's worth seeing this movie more than once for the Village People bit alone). But, um, worth buying? Shhhyeah! Maybe if you have this, like, weird obsession with Mike Myers in his underwear..."
2,Not as good as the first!,"Wayne's World was about two guys that hosted a show from Wayne's basement. This time they do the show from an abandoned warehouse. Wayne still dates Cassandra. (remember her from the first movie). If you haven't seen the first, then here's what you missed. Waune and Garth does Wayne's World from his parent's basement.One night, Wayne has a dream. That he is in on a beach talking to a dead rock star. He tells Wayne to put on a concert. And saids, ""If you book them they will come.""Wayne aslo asks if Garth will get a speacil package. And the very next morning, Garth does. Wayne has finnaly moved out of his parents' home and into his own place. Aslo Wayne and Garth doesn't talk to the people very much in this film like they did in the first."
4,Far-out,"It's a great movie with two geeks hwo knows how to rock. And I love the Lepracon part, it's the best."
3,This sequel will appeal more to a wider audience,"Some of the uninspired jokes of the first film are thrown in here, though there is still a lot to like in this more successful teen comedy. Unlike its predecessor, it works because of effective ""in"" material and better performances from the duo. Laugh-out-loud hilarious moments include the martial arts fight between Wayne and Casandra's Asian dad, the part where Wayne posed as a member of the Village People, the Thelma and Louise ""ending"", Chris Farley's outrageous performance, Charlton Heston's cameo, the chemistry between Wayne and Honey Hornee, and the Graduate finale (which ironically the intended youth audience probably might not get). Not to say that World 2 always hits the bullseye, but parody fans should give this one a look."
2,Okay,"Wayne's World was a classic, but this one just didn't measure up. It was funny but I expected more. Of course, I know that most sequels fail but I hoped Wayne's World 2 wouldn't suck. I am greatly disapointed but I think you should see it at least once."
4,A MUST SEE...OH YES! A MUST SEE,"Comedy writers agree you don't write a joke on a joke. Wayne's World 2is an exception. The movie works because Wayne (Mike Myers)( and Garth(Dana Carvey) are among the very few comic actors who get laughs every time the camera points there way. A more likeable comic duo you'll rarely see. They are unpretentious and honestly likeable--like bad littlekids who broke your window but turned it into a joke. So how can you get mad?Ok, you can say the movie's dumb. It is pointless. It goes for cheap laughs. True.But when did you ever get a fullbelly laugh from stoic Charlton Heston?I rest my case."
5,Funny!,"I love this movie. It rocks! But I have to say the funniest line is Del saying:""The shopkeeper and his son, now that's a different story altogether. I had to beat them to death with their own shoes."""
2,Yawn.....are we having fun yet?,"I love Wayne's World. I love Wayne's World 2 more. NOT!!!!! This sequel is nowhere near as much fun as the original. ""Fun"" hardly makes an appearence in this flick. The jokes are weak; basically they just show us that they ran out of the good ones. It may be the change in directors, I don't know. All I know is this movie is not worth watching. It starts out like you would want a sequel to, and it stays that way.....for about 5 minutes. I turned it off about half way through. Thank God I only rented this one."
5,THE BEST OF MIKE MYERS & DANA CARVEY,"THIS MOVIE IS THE SEQUEL TO THE FIRST WAYNE'S WORLD. THIS ONE IS EVEN BETTER. IT STARTS OUT WITH GARTH & WAYNE GOING TO AN AEROSMITH (MY FAVORITE ROCK BAND) CONCERT IN CHICAGO. THEN WAYNE HAS TROUBLE DECIDING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS LIFE. SO JIM MORRISON VISITS HIM IN A DREAM AND TELLS HIM TO PUT ON A CONCERT IN AURORA. NOW THEY ARE OUT TO PUT ON THE CONCERT WITH THE HELP OF A NAKED INDIAN, A OLD ROCK & ROLL RODIO, AND THEIR BUDS."
3,"You're Worthy, Get Up!","Wayne and Garth are back and well, just back. Wayne had a dream about a naked native man who took him to Jim Morrison. He must put together the biggest concert in Aurora, Illinois. Well, it takes forever for them to actually assemble the concert, Waynestock. Because before that, Wayne fights his girlfriend's father in subtitles and he gets shunned by Cassandra's new record producer. Not as funny as the first, but Chris Farley shows up to make things better. Enough partying already."
5,haaah!!,ww2 is awesome perhaps better than 1 it is hilarious!the dream scenes are hilarious as is the scene in which wayne scares the hell outta garth by pretending to be 'the leprecaun'!and the line said by garth 'hey there goes garth and his friend wayne.......the pscopath!'
3,Wayne's World 2(1993),"Wayne's World 2(1993) is a decent sequel. It doesn't reach the apex of the first film, but it's still fun. Wayne Campbell(Mike Myers) struggles to get concert Waynestock off the ground. Wayne's World 2 spoofs kung fu films, The Graduate(1967) and The Doors(1991). Wayne, Garth, and their friends do a Village People homage in one scene. The formula for Wayne's World 2 is similar to the first film. The sad ending, the Scooby Doo ending, and the happy ending are crammed into one film. Christopher Walken played the film's ""bad guy"". Drew Barrymore made a cameo in the film. Myers moved on to the Austin Powers movies in the late 1990's. His career has been in trouble since the 2008 bomb The Love Guru. Myers and Dana Carvey played Wayne and Garth on an MTV special in 2008. Wayne's World 2 is a decent sequel."
3,Better Than The Original,"Yeah, it's a stupid movie but I did get some big laughs out of this in a few spots. Admittedly, I watched this twice, probably to ogle Kim Bassinger one more time. I also thought this ""sequel"" was better than the first Wayne's World movie anyway. From what I see here, most people agree with that.I did not appreciate showing a minister blaspheming. That's Hollywood for you. Without the extreme irreverence in here, I might have held onto this DVD ust to have something stupid to laugh at once every few years....and to laugh especially at that scene when Dana Carvey meets Bassinger in the laundromat ."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Wayne's World 2 is so slight that I couldn't bring myself to really hate it, but it has none of the wit or humor of the original, and thus feels overlong and unnecessary."
5,"excellent, maybe even better then the first.....","THE movie to get for a party, along with the first. but as i've said in another review, do you know what would really be cool?WAYNES WORLD 3: 10 YEARS LATERwell, thats just my opinion, but other then that, BUY THIS MOVIE!"
2,NO LEGEND,"Raful Neal's Louisiana Legend is OK at best. To me, only a few cuts were good. He is good to very good when he and his fellow musicians play instrumentals. The producer should have focused on that strength and been more selective in choosing the songs for the album, staying within a narrower range. It's hard to say what will appeal to other folks, but for me, the quality of the album as a whole falls short, and I was somewhat disappointed."
4,Please try to remember it's for your child to play with not you.,"Cool little toy, wanted something to keep my toddler entertained while bathing and this one did the trick. Actually got hooked playing with the thing until he reminded me it was his toy. Made it a challenge by putting obstacles in the way and making him maneuver around them. After two years and a lot of batteries sub still does what I purchased it for."
3,"Good for sidewalks, Pointless for stairs","The long and the short of it.This product is fine if you only travel with your cart places that do not include stairs. I bought this thinking it would be easier to carry the table up and down stairs, I live in the city, and do outcalls, many of my clients are on 3rd floor walk ups. This cart is not designed for stairs, it is really only helpful for walking on a very flat surface. And by the time you set it up, get the straps on, etc, well...20 minutes later, you get the idea. Not very practical.I do not recommend this.A"
4,Ainsle hits a home run for the knowledgeable handicapper,"Tom Ainsle covers a lot of topics on Horse Racing and he explains then in good detail and with a wealth of personal knowledge.This book may be a few years older then many others, but it is still a very important one on the subject of handicapping.Tom did a great job and if your serious about picking horses, this one should be in your library.Best Regards to all, MC - TheStickRules.Com"
2,Good 1st Reference,"easy to see that this was the predecessor to many guides to follow. Not enough new information that hasn't been rehashed by following guides. Touches every base; speed, pace, class, condition...but doesn't provide his take on which should take precedence. Where is your 'solid lock' angle? All guides should take this leap and provide its First Choice/First Pass angles and this one does not. Good for your first dive into the game, but not for anyone with 2+ years experience."
4,"So much to learn, So little time!","Ainslie takes it to the micro with way too much information for a novice live me. I really enjoyed learning of how the sport as a whole ""works"" and WHY there's so much information printed in the Daily Racing Form."
4,Complete but needs to updated,"The book covers eveything but tends to be complicated at times. The author provides so much info, it becomes almost impossible to remember all of it without reading the book several times. ( I read it at least 4 times ). Also, some of the information is quite outdated and might not be useful at this time. Overall this is a very good book , but needs to be revised."
3,"Amazing Content, Frustrating Form","This is an excellent text on functional analysis. I read a few books through the library when learning the subject and really loved the clarity of Reed-Simon the most. Also, the exercises are great.However, the actual book that I received felt almost like photocopy quality and was difficult to read. The whole point of purchasing such an expensive text is to have it in your hands without the strain of staring at a computer screen. Elsevier did a downright crappy job with the new version (not the old maroon one)."
3,Not their best,Have seen LC & the Nightcats several times; they are a brilliant live band. I don't believe the material included here touches on that brilliance.
3,"For a Blues Fan,2 Fanastic Tracks, rest not exactly my style","Little Charlie Baty is an absolutely fabulous guitar player. 'Ten Years Ago' would have be to one of the best guitar pieces I have heard. 'Rain' also shows his talent. Unfortunately, the rest is a totally different style, being bouncy, humorous but much less intense, and only bordering on blues as I like it. However, the above two tracks still make it a worthwhile purchase."
3,Good solid story,"Three stars seems a little low for this book in some ways, but four is a little high. So I'm really giving it 3 and a half. It's a good solid read but with a few plot holes. The pacing is excellent and the action is told well. I didn't care much for the woman character but, on the other hand, she was more original than the standard ""good woman"" type that you see in a lot of westerns. The most interesting character to me was King Fisher himself, who was a secondary character. I'd love to see HIS story.Charles GramlichAuthor of Cold in the Light"
5,posting about poster,"Having lived in Portland Or when the art was added to downtown and then the future mayor of the city posed for this iconic photo - I have always had a fondness for and appreciation(like some possess for the Farrah Fawcett poster)for the idea - reinforced by its universality of hanging in the studio of a professional potter in Orlando (who did not know the backstory)... included in a picture on a website of how to organize a college dorm room in 2012 (the poster was on the lower left of a stack of cubicles on Yahoo, a n d when visiting my best friend in Or in June'11 the first place we went was Goose Hollow Inn, owned by Bud Clark (said Mayor). The poster went to my friend as a birthday gift which he will frame and put on his garage wall. We are both satisfied with my purchase."
3,Cover art is nice but look inside,"If you like people with wings this book will be perfect for you. If you like faeries in the truest sense, maybe you should reconsider.Though a book with pleasant visuals, offered in bite-sized showcase of several artists, I wasn't entirely satisfied with selections, the impression I get was the seemingly overuse of portrait poses with wings slapped onto the backs of curvy women. Might be attractive to some, but it makes me wonder if that's all to faery art. A couple of the artworks appear to be from amateur artists from the lack of proportion and painting techniques. Some artists offer an alternative take on faery art with sprites and pixies which are pretty but overall I thought this book wasn't too memorable."
4,Nice.,"A good book to compare different Faery artists styles. But not necessarily one that you would refer to over and over, as you may only find a few artworks that you really like.If you like Faery art, a book featuring an artist whose work you really love would be money better spent. Just to see other artists's work only once you can search the net."
2,Some Good some not so good,This is a collection of various artists who are supposedly the best of the fantasy lot. I found a few artists that were incredible. But most of them were mediocre at best.
5,beautifull,This book came in a timely manner. It has a good assortment of artists represented and the art work is georgous. It will be a very usefull reference and source of inspiration for my art work.
5,Good series with a lot of books,"Mary Daheim has written 2 series; both with a lot of books. I've read all of the bed and breakfast ones exc the newest book. Then I started this Alpine series. Where I could buy the books in the Kindle editions, I did. But to start at the beginning of each series, I had to order paper backs. This was one of them. When they've been out a long time, why the publish date for the Kindle is so far in the future I cant fathom. Anyway, I have enjoyed both series; and after about 2 months of reading this author, I have almost completed all of them. I like her characters a lot. The main character in each series isnt exactly a senior citizen, but over the years she has been getting older. And better. Would highly recommend this author and both series."
2,Morality?,"On reading through the book, I enjoyed the characters and the plot. But then it left a bad taste in my mouth. This character is supposed to be a practicing Roman Catholic, but she's spent 20 years in an adulterous affair, hoping that the marriage (admittedly a bad one) breaks up. Of course, that wouldn't leave him free to marry in the Church. And lest you think the author only thinks Catholics don't care about marriage vows, her staunchly Presbyterian, liquor only for the sick, employee, several criticizes her for giving up on the married for someone who is at least divorced."
1,Worse video seen,after watching the fist three video i had to stop the audio and video quality are horrible poorly made as a salsa loverand purchaser this is by far the worst video i seen.RLD
2,Horrible changes to a good storyline,"The storyline of this movie is not anything close to the story of the Illiad. The writer took too many liberties. The original story was good enough, so why change thing so much? If Homer wrote this version of the Illiad, we would never have heard of Homer or the Illiad."
4,A Worthy Adaptation,"As one who knows Homer's stories well, I was satisfied. This kind of adaptation could have easily gone wrong! Perhaps it is not ""great,"" but it is certainly ""very good,"" at least. The heart of the film feels very true to the original. And the whole cast is excellent, especially the two stars, Bana and Pitt.Among the nice surprises is how the filmmakers dealt with the ""Achilles heel"" story -- by poking fun at it."
3,Correction,"Please ignore the previous two reviews of this disc. R. Guentner made a valid point based on the aspect ratio of 1.66:1 listed for the disc. Thankfully, this is a mistake made by the people at Amazon. The Blu-ray disc, like the DVD and HD-DVD versions, is actually presented in the correct aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Embarrassingly, Jesse Vela completely missed the point. If the Blu-ray release had actually been chopped down to 1.66:1 from the correct aspect ratio, this would have been an insult to the film, but it turns out just to be a typo."
2,Changed music?,"First, let me say Troy is one of my favorite movies of all time. I was very excited about the director's cut and immediately bought the collector's edition. One thing I noticed right away is that the musical score is different. I really, really don't like the different score. It completely ruined the movie for me. I thought the score to the theatrical release was perfect. Changing it for director's cut without giving me the option for the other really bothered me. The picture quality is great however."
3,"TROY: IT""S NOT FULL HD","It's too bad that you can not receive TROY in MVC FULL HI-DEF. Yes, it Hi-DEF..but NOT FULL HD..there lies the rub for me...NO DTS, NO 1080P/24 frames...TOO BAD...All the other jive included with the Director's Edition with fancy packaging and pictures, even though pictures of Diane Kruger is worth the buy, leaves me ripped off by the studio..."
3,"A bland, souless movie.","I have to wonder who approves these projects in Hollywood. I guess the execs felt safe retelling an old story using big-name stars. But the end product was just another empty action adventure with cardboard cut-out characters. While Russell Crowe was inspiring in Gladiator, Brad Pitt falls flat as Achilles. Frankly he is not a very good actor and has done nothing noteworthy since Fight Club. I was not bored by this movie, but I was also not moved by it either. Its worth renting, but noting more."
3,A disappointemnt,"Bold and ambitious, ""Troy"" adds little to the historical epic genre. It has all the right moves in the epic area - great battles, great sets, etc. On the human scale, it succeeds barely at all. Still, it has an overall grandeur and sweep that is both entertaining and interesting. It succeeds in spite of its flaws.In the great epics - from ""The Ten Commandments"" to ""Spartacus"" to ""Gladiator"" - there is a balance between great battles for great causes and the love between a man and a woman.""Troy"" doesn't succeed on the human level. The legend is that the Greek Paris [Orlando Bloom] took Helen of Troy [Diane Kruger] away from her husband, the King [Brian Cox], which caused the Trojan War. But nothing in the relationship between Paris and Troy suggests a great passion that would cause a great war. The subplot about the great warrior Achilles' [Brad Pitt] love of a Trojan priestess is much more involving, but it hardly explains reasons for the war."
3,It was not that bad,"While it is no Gladiator this can be a fun little movie if you don't read to much into it.I will say that:- it wasn't an especially coherant or well-thought out adaptation (best bit - Aeneas introduced three minutes from the end; sole character development: ""I'm Aeneas"").- it wasn't subtle.- it wasn't fresh or original.- it didn't have good dialogue.- it attempted to do moral ambiguity and screwed up totally.- it was pure Hollywood.At least when the movie is over you know that you don't have to see it ever agian if you don't want to. You also know that you never have to see Brad Pitt's naked butt agian if you don't want to."
2,Where's David Lean When We Really Need Him?,"Aside from all the historical and mythological errata, Wolfgang Petersen can't seem to handle actors very well. Most performances were over the top - it's a wonder any scenery was left after this bunch got through chewing it. With the exception of Mr. O'Toole and Ms. Christie (both alumni of David Lean directed epic films and both of whom had very brief moments of dialogue/monologue), the other actors could have used a circus ringmaster to keep them in line.To use the most improper English I can - ""Troy"" ain't no ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and Wolfgang Petersen t'ain't no David Lean!"
4,Classic,"A very well done classic tale of Achilles, and the Trojan wars of ancient Greek legend. Not for the pacifist. No good rationale for war either. The story of ""El Cid"" is far superior as it was based on a Christian ethic for war, set during the dark ages of Spain."
4,"Great Quality, but wish it had a little more options","The movies quality and director's cut scenes adds new depth to the characters and story all round. The additional commentary and historical comparison to Homer's original Iliad answers all the questions fans of the poem could ask. The only option missing is switching between the Theatrical and Director's cut. You only get the Director's cut and there is no formal menu that includes scene selection. Despite this, you receive a lot for the money with Wolfgang Peter's commentary, historic reference, and much more. Definite Must Buy for the fan of this interpretation of the poem."
5,Troy,"This is one movie that Blu-ray was made for. If you have Blu-ray, and a dvd copy of Troy, give it away and buy it in Blu-ray. 1080p quality really shines in Troy, I am very impressed."
1,It sucks! Need I say more?,"I've seen this film in theatres twice when it first came out. All I have to say is, I was very disappointed with this movie. I've read Homer's ""The Iliad"", and the film was nothing like that. All that I saw was a Brad Pitt lovefest- to Brad Pitt, from Brad Pitt."
1,The stars,"THe movie was exciting with all the battles and the scenery and music were fine. However, I did not realize what a stone-faced, bad actor Brad Pitt was. Good-looking, yes, but acting NO. The best actor in the movie was Peter O'toole the ony non-wooden character."
1,TROY,"THIS MOVIE WAS VERY SLOW AND BORING TO WATCH. THE ACTORS EVEN SEEMED BORED. THE MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER. I WAS VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED I GIVE IT 1 STAR. THE STAR THAT I HAVE GIVEN IS FOR THE SCENERY. THE DIALOGUE IN THE MOVE WAS TERRIBLE, PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE ACTORS WERE SO MISERABLE"
1,"Should be called ""Achilles"" ...or The Brad Pitt epic","I was so sick of Brad Pitt's puffy face by the end of this movie. He was in practically every scene and it really ruined the movie for me. The story wasn't developed enough, Branna's part as Hector was fabulous and his portrayal was fabulous. Orlando Bloom's character Paris was downright cowardly, foppish and almost dislikable.I really felt the part of Achilles was badly played, and it was very hard to believe Brad Pitt was this great warrior. He's just not the type. He was too small and not believable at all that he could be beating all those men.See another epic, see Gladiator or even Braveheart, over this. I hope it does not kill Branna's career."
1,A shame,"I can understand film makers cared nothing about Homer's Illiad and changed everything, even the unbearable gay relationship between Aquiles and Patroclus, which was ok 4,000 years ago but they had to hide it now a days, who knows why.What I cannot understand, even trying hard to, is the appearence of those llamas walking along over the soil of ancient Thesalia.Wasnt America be found on 1492 and so llamas and other american animals?Make a joke of Homer, who maybe created all these Troy stuff, but guys, not of history and geography!!If Homer Illiad is too hard for you to read, at least watch some on the discovery channel, please."
1,total joto,"good movie except for brad pitt, he is a total joto he couldnt even kill a fly nevermind another human being his character was not believeable at all"
3,The Pitts,"A comic book treatment of a great tale and profound philosophical treatise for the age in which it found voice. Alexander the Great carried a copy with him always and read from it almost daily it is said. Look no further....Brad Pitt for Zeus' sake! Achilles is an insolent punk who is tedious and unconvincing. Warriors of that time were lean and athletic. Brad was simply pumped up and bicepted to a degree. Silly! His armor looked that of a super hero. The support cast was good with the possible exception of O'Toole who languished in prosaic charactor acting. All in all the movie was a light, sometimes interesting, often goofy, badly costumed, contemporary diversion. Homer would have been mildly amused or more likely, completely horrified."
5,Magnifico,This movie was fantastic! I have watched it at least 25 times already and I could watch it another 25 times. Eric Bana should have received an academy award for his performance. The fight scenes were so exciting and the special effects were enchanting. I loved the music. Brad was OK but Eric was the Best!
3,Should have theatrical Version!,"Blu-ray discs can fit so much, yet this only has the director's cut, there is a reason why a group of people told the director that these scenes were going to be taken out and these were going to stay. The directors cut just about ruins the whole movie. Even the fight scenes, he shows them from different angle's and there is no more poetry to them. I would give this a 1 star but the original versions is one of my favorite movies, so i have to give troy 3 stars. if i were you, i'd wait until a blu-ray with both versions comes out."
3,Brad Pitt of Troy,"It is because of Brad Pitt,that this movie has won some accolades (if it did deserve).The history was distorted,but Achilles did a fine job.None,but Brad Pitt deserved and could have executed that Achilles arrogance.Helen (Diane Krueger) was a waste.This movie was'nt Helen of Troy.But a beauty that could wage an epic battle of Troy (and hence the word,Trojan,emanated from here), this role could have been done more justice by a prettier woman - Catherine Zeta Jones.She looked marvellous in The Mask of Zorro.And she did not have too much of a role to play in the movie :)"
3,"Some good, some bad","The movie is pretty good for the most part but has some glaring problems. First of all is the terrible casting. This is a greek epic-with no greeks! I realize the move was made in America but come on! Brendan Gleeson <the big red headed Irish guy from gangs of new york> as a Greek king? Laughable. Brad Pitt as Achilles? I like Pitt but he should be playing Sigfried not Achilles. The main bright spot to this movie is Eric Bana as Hector. Bana comes off as truely heroic, and the most likable character of the film. He fights for his country, his family , and because he has to. That is a stark contrast to Achilles vain quest for personal glory and fame. The moves suffers badly after Hectors death. Oncehe gets killed by the vain peacock achilles I did not have anyone to cheer for and lost total interest. But its not all bad, the action sequences are spectacular and make this DVD worth owning by themselves."
2,Waste of Time,"I was really looking forward to seeing this moving, and as always when there is to much buildup for a movie it never lives up to it. This movie was so far from the actual story, I almost got up and left. If you know anything about the history of the story of Troy, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. Very disappointing and I would never recommend this movie to anyone."
1,Dog Of War,"Watched this for the first time two weeks ago. And I have to agree with the bad reviews here. It was actually an insult to our intelligences I think.After Gladiator and LOTR, this really is an epic on autopilot. The entire film moves along with no real characterisations, 1 dimensional performances....at great speed so we can get onto the next action set piece.Characters saying time and time again through the film how they were going to go down in history...yeah we got it first time, no need to keep repeating it.I could go on....like this film, but I wont. It was boring, embarassing (we laughed many times, but it wasnt meant to be a comedy, was it?). Just a shallow, waste of money. It could have been something, but it wasnt."
1,A Mule in Horse Harness...,"A last-ditch attempt by Warner Bros. to squeeze a few more pennies out of an epic disappointment...and just when I had forgotten the butchery Wolftgang Peterson and his gang of Hollywood henchmen did to the Iliad. Even dressed over again, this film is a study in how to destroy a great story."
3,Troy is not so bad,"Like most reviewers here it seems, I was questionnable about my reaction to the movie, but heck, I was in the mood for some pure entertainment. At first, I was agreeing with the critics in that the movie was slow going, but passed the first 30 minutes, I was into the setting, characters, and plot.Knowing how it ends ahead of time is always a drag, but this time I was genuinely upset because I had really gotten into it. It was the Achilles/Bresias romance that did it. Peter O'Toole plays a very convincing king Priam, and Pitt was believable as Achilles. Brian Cox's Agamemnon seemed a bit too gung-ho tooting at times, but it is needed in order to believe why not only does Achilles call him a ""sack of wine"" but also the pure greed he has to be the sole ruler of all the Greek lands. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised, so if you're in the mood to be entertained and have a good story behind it(albeit not fully accurate)then rent it. Like one of those 1950 epic films but modernized."
2,Not Very Historical,"Although the movie contains some of the most popular actors, the story lacks truth. For example: Achilles never goes into Troy and dies before. Patroclus is sent to fight by Achilles. Menelaus does not die. Etc etc. Incredibly unaccurate and disappointingly so. The lines are sometimes cliched although delivered alright. Helen and Paris play minor roles. Hector is portrayed well and Bana gives a good performance. The movie doesn't compare to LOTR and is a disappointment."
3,"Troy's fallen, and it can't get up","Troy feels like the writing & dialogue wasn't running at full capacity, despite the abundance of resources. The end result is a loose interpretation of The Iliad, spoken in a wee bit too casual English. But Troy isn't afraid to show off its humongous budget to the viewer, and indeed it is an impressive sight. The visuals are stunning, the battle sequences are exciting, and the movie does seem shorter than its actual running time. For escapism, Troy is a great choice, but purists will find plenty of flaws..."
2,Surf's Up!,"Hey, Brad Pitt, the surf's up! Where's your surf board? This is what played in my mind the whole time I watched this extravaganza of mindless boredom. Pitt's pretty, with sharply defined abs and hair extensions and bronzer. But Hollywood's obsession with pretty boys, instead of real he-men, is fatally on display here. To me, Troy was a ferociously charismatic warrior--like Steve Reeves. In fact, if a theater should double-bill ""Troy"" along with a typical Reeves flesh-and-fur spectacle from the late fifties, the Reeves potboiler would probably be a lot more enjoyable. ""Gladiator"" got it right in many ways. It had Russell Crowe as the stern looking, beefy hero who looked like he had been around the block a few times. Watching Pitt, I wondered how much plastic surgery he's undergone so far?"
2,Did anyone read Homer?,"To modern audience where the name Homer brings images of ""d'oh""! destroying this centuries-old story may not matter, but to thoise of use that accually care aobut hisotroy and preserving it, and have read the story of the Trojoin war, will not be able to sit still in our seats. Now I dont want to go into detail for those of you that may not have seen it, but the movie is missing key plot points and even dares to change the end for some on the charicters!!!Now I can see the art that goes in the movie, but destroying Homer brings this movie to 2 stars."
4,"Lighten up! It's a great action movie, if nothing else!","I watched this movie with no expectations. I hadn't read the classic novel it was taken from nor am I some great literature expert. I like to be entertained..taken away from my regular old day-to-day grind..nothing more..nothing less. This movie did that for me. The action scenes were great and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I loved watching Peter O'Toole scenes, especially since he has always been a favorite of mine. His character's unquestionable love for his sons, no matter what decisions they made, was heartwarming to me. It was a great escape epic."
4,"Great to get, but you can't get it here","As a Prime member, and eniticed into the 10% off HD-DVDs deal, I was disappointed to find out that most of the HD-DVDs I wanted were not available at amazon. You can get them nearly anywhere else, but not hear. I tried to talk to customer service, but they don't speak English real well, so that didn't help. What else can't you get on HD-DVD at Amazon, even though they are everywhere else? Let's see....Aeon FluxFour BrothersWe Were SoldiersThe Italian JobThe Manchurian CandidateU2: Rattle & HumPretty big list. Batman Begins will be released Oct. 10th. Would you like to pre-order it? Well you can't from Amazon. But enjoy the 10% off. If anyone that works for Amazon actually reads this, I would love some kind of explanation. In fact, you could put it on the same page as the products that are already released that you show as ""not yet released."" It makes me wonder if I made a mistake in becoming a Prime member. All I want is a little information."
4,Troy,"Michael and I watched this on TV from our room in New York City. I tried to explain it to him and to myself. It is from the Iliad written by the Greek poet Homer. Ilium is a word for Troy. Trojan Paris seduced Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Greece. The Greeks sacked Troy, using a wooden horse to enter the city. Brad Pitt is Achilles, the Greek hero who kills Hector. Achilles dies when Paris shoots an arrow into his heel. Michael asked if the part about the horse was true. I said the story is half true and half made up. The Trojan War was fought around 1200 B.C. Homer lived around 800 B.C."
3,A Good and Entertaining Big Budget Epic,"Troy is an entertaining big budget summer action movie. It's got the big action sequences and big stars. I never read the Iliad or any other greek stories but as a movie in itself I'd say it is good. The thing I liked most about the movie was Eric Bana as Hector. His performance was excellent even though he had to work with a pretty awful script. Also, Brian Cox as Agamennon is worth watching too. Overall, it was a good summer movie. Worth owning on DVD."
2,"Anyone want my ticket to ""Troy?"" Take it, it's yours!","The only thing worse than the dialogue in this film is the musical score. There were a few cool action scenes, and the balls of fire was a nice visual effect, but this movie just falls flat of being the epic it should have been. The fighting and battle scenes were very poorly done and there just wasn't enough action. The trailer shows those thousands of ships sailing to Troy and you think all Hell will break lose in the film, but it's more like all heck breaks lose, and then we go back to some more bad dialogue.I didn't really see any bad acting (although Pitt hammed it up a bit too much with the delivery of some of his lines), buit it just didn't seem like the characters melded together very well. And as I said when you add in James Horner's HORRIBLE soundtrack, which felt out of place during many parts of the film, it just made for a very bad movie experience for me, and WAY too long."
5,Enjoyed the movie!,"My husband and I had just watched this movie this weekend. We are both familiar with Homer's Illiad. Yes, this movie was not exactly the same literally, but this was still a good and enjoyable movie from another perspective. We both thought the actors did a great job in portraying their characters. Eric Bana's performance was great! And Brad Pitt was also good in portraying Achilles. The choreography and scenery was brilliant as well. Frankly, some of the negative reviews I'm reading here, I'm just wondering if these people are just already biased about the film and just want to be vindictive on some of the actors in this movie.Overall, it's an enjoyable film from beginning to end and was worth watching!"
2,Lost in translation.,"But it is supposed to be entertaining whereas The Iliad was homework. A big, flaccid, on location, away from Hollywood flop. Thanks to dvd no Brad Pitt movie ever loses money. Troy just isn't very good. Lots of 21st century guys in ancient costumes talking like 21st century guys. Brad Pitt worked out for this. He is buff & everything. He is a good actor, which is not to be confused with a very good or great actor. His legions will love it (Brad Pitt without his pants). The action & fight scenes are excellent. Production is excellent. But after nearly three hours I wasn't interested in investing any more time, so I passed on the extras."
3,Neither Here Nor There,"Good battle scenes, though few; beautiful sets; exquisite scenery, however... First of all, why does Menelaus die? Why does Paris stay alive? Why doesn't Cassandra ever make an appearance? Why does Briseis kill Agammemnon? Why the heck are ALL THE FACTS from Homer's epic changed? I don't understand why Orlando Bloom (Paris) is featured as a starring actor in epic films, when his acting sucks. Brad Pitt (Achilles) isn't too bad, however I'm sure that most women were mostly concerned with his ""physique"" rather than his acting. And the only actor I was actually looking forward to seeing, Sean Bean (Odysseus), was always in the background. Eric Bana (Hector) was great, and Peter O'Tootle (Priam), as expected, gave a performance worthy of a king. The movie was beautifully made, but was ruined by its inconsistency."
2,BUY THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE A BRAD PITT COLLECTOR:-(,"I LIKED THE BALLS OF FIRE, THE TROJAN HORSE THAT WAS ABOUT THE GIST OF IT!! THE DIALOG WAS DISMAL! REMEMBER GUYS/GAYS, BRAD LOST HIS LIFE FOR A DIZZY WOMAN:-( NOT EVEN A GREAT LOVE SCENE?! RENT BEFORE YOU BUY !!!"
3,More is not always better.,"Perhaps the good deal about this Director's Cut are the prolonged action sequences and the more colorful image, but when it turns to the time given to expand the characters development, the film feels way too slow and long at times. I also didn't like the inclusion of borrowed themes from other movie scores (such as Planet of the Apes) to replace James Horner's at many times of this new version. If any new music was to be included, they should have used the amazing trailer themes which were completely ignored in the theatrical score; this was a perfect opportunity to put them into the film.It still feels like a movie that tries too hard to be epic and serious in so many levels, and somehow fails. In the end it's enjoyable, but its extended running time isn't justified by what is added, yet if what you're looking for is a gorier version of ""Troy"", then you'll be pleased."
3,Epic...but Brad?,Great movie overall but Brad Pitt was not right for the part he played. He was over the top and couldn't compare to Eric Bana who played Hector. But the movie was overall great!
4,Adds Nice Amount Of Gore And Nudity,"I was slightly disappointed with the visual transfer, I thought it could have been less grainy. This director's cut adds in gore during the fight scenes and nudity throughtout the film."
5,Much better,"I watched the two movies side by side with my duel set up screen and paused the original whenever it deviated from the directors cut. All in all the cut was muuuuuch better than the original, the only itty bitty downside is they changed the score during hector and Achilles fight and the original score was better than the random battle music the cut has for the same fight. On that note though the fight is much more well done and brad shines through as a better actor in the directors cut while he seems sorta stale/cool but that's it in the original."
4,Blu-Ray Troy is a... Joy. =),"I remember just thinking the movie was just okay when I saw it in the theater. Eric Bana's Hector was the one thing holding the film together. But watching this new version at home it feels a little more rounded. There is no addition of plot or major sequences it's just little sprinkles here and there. Characters seem to have a little more breathing room. The taking of Troy is definitely a little more graphic which I feel grounds the film a bit more than it's theatrical release. Overall it's a film that is quite satisfying as an epic tale and an action film. The fight scenes were well designed and a little different then the other sword films out there.As for the transfer, it's breathtaking. The detail on the wide shots of the army is astounding. The colors pop and the sound is crisp and clear. This would be a nice demo disc for the adults and not the kiddies."
4,A Cut Above Your Everyday Epic,"Much better than the reviewers rated it. It was critisized for its writing, but I think the dialogue is superb, as long as you accept that ancient Greeks didn't speak like Southern Californians.And great battle scenes.Most importanlty, the acting brought out a lot of the personal drama in the story that Homer fails to impart to a modern mind. ""He died. He fell. Darkness covered his eyes."" Instead you feel how the characters are trapped by the conflict and the tragedy and you actually empathize with them--something of an accomplishment for a film based on a well-worn myth."
5,Love this movie... however,"this movie really is a great epic movie hoewver like pointed out doesnt fallow what really happend to a tee... but unfortunatly there are so many versions... who is to know... fallowing up on one reviews about the events after Achilles death is VERY gloom and would have broght the masses of people to dissapointment. this kinda movie if you would follow it to the teee many ppl would turn away from it. but for what this movie is... its awesome. what these kind of movies do is fuel young kids to read about what Really happend read uponj stuff maybe they woudlnt have touched other wise.All the actors in this moive did wonderfully and unlike ""Helen of Troy"" the Actresss was beautifully casted and acted."
3,"Director's Cut: It looks, sounds, and IS better","The extra footage gives this movie room to breathe and improves the pacing. The many changes in the soundtrack are a GREAT improvement: the ""wailing woman"" is kept to a minimum and is therefore more appropriate when it does appear. Watching this DC of the movie made me wish, yet again, that studios would release the cut the director wanted to start with. The movie also looks a lot better - brighter, clearer and without the ""antiquing"" tint.This is a better version of ""Troy"" than the theatrical release, but it is still the same movie. It has not been totally transformed, like the DC of ""Kingdom of Heaven"", which elevated it to masterpiece status, IMHO, but it is better and more enjoyable. I would say that Odysseus benefits the most from the extra scenes."
3,An improvement,"I thought the original was an okay film, if you know your history and read the books. If not you'll be wondering 'what did I miss?' In fact the original movie did leave out some parts/details and this dvd fills in the void. To me, I didn't like the score being changed and it took away from the film then added to it. But hey, thats what the additional footage was for. They removed some of the original footage and replaced it. In temple scene, it looked like BP was taking a dump in the corner. Personally they shouldn't of changed that part b/c I raised an eyebrow when I saw it siince it looked rather funny.XD Other then that, its an okay dvd to have if you have an open mind a/o enjoy epic war films, Which ever it may be. ^_^"
5,excellent,"Very good product ... I it recommend me great taste. Very good quality, I come rapidly and his quality is surprising..I like it"
4,To Pitt the best Warriors from each side is the way to battle.,"Pitt did a great job in this movie... I thought Bana did very well, but his brother should have been whacked."
3,A lot of violence and a totally misinterpreted story,"The Iliad story has survived through the thousands of years because it was refined to perfection. So it would be a common sense to try to stay close to the original story and not try to ""improve"" it. Unfortunately, the movie has very little in common with the original Iliad.It became a really primitive film with a lot of blood and violence.Pretty much the only reason I finished watching the movie was to see how far the story if off and I wouldn't watch it again."
1,"Inspired by Homer's ""The Iliad""","Maybe, but probably not. Inspired is a word that could not possibly be used with this complete ""mess"" of a movie. If there were to be an award for ""Worst Screenplay Ever Written"" then David Benioff should win that award - absolutely no competition need apply. The other interesting note is how the director of Das Boot has sunk this low - but not surprising since his last outing was almost as bad (The Perfect Storm). Now he has given us ""The Perfect Mess"" - what a waste of time, talent, energy, and money. Even Brad cannot save this movie (even though he does give it a courageous try). Ironic at best (and not even a guilty pleasure). A total loss!"
1,Pathetic.,"This film was given one star only because it is the lowest available. Normally I'm a big fan of Brad Pitt (as an actor), but his pathetic attempts to channel Russell Crowe in Gladiator are painful to watch. Yes, there's a lot of action, but that certainly doesn't make up for the wooden acting, not to mention the desperate grasping for that one memorable catch-phrase (""Is there no one else?!"" comes to mind, among others). Bleh. Not to mention the fact that you should never try to outdo perfection; although this is an adaptation, it seems like a bad high school production. The Iliad is a masterpiece, and Pitt has only managed to mangle it with his hopes of being remembered as an ""action hero"". The only redeeming quality this movie has is Eric Bana's portrayal of Hector. Perhaps he should have been given the lead."
1,It's hilarious how STUPID Hollywood is!,A turd making lazy circles in a toilet bowl is more entertaining than this film. Brad Pitt is UGLY and about as charismatic as Ben Stiller. Orlando Bloom would have been better as the female lead. Both must be taking acting lessons from Jennifer Aniston because they're terrible! Peter O'Toole's hair looks like it was done by Sigfried and Roy. Poor Eric (the ONLY good performance in the movie) Bana's headgear looks like a trash can out of Cher's bathroom. (...)
2,Troy: 50's Hollywood,"Hard to keep a straight face watching this one. It feels like we've retrograded back to 50's Hollywood - clean, modern Americans with lots of hair gel, starched denim tunics, and heavy plastic necklaces parading around as warriors. I keep waiting for Burt Lancaster to show up somewhere; for Kirk Douglas to arrive on a chariot; for Charlton Heston with a Big Beard to trek down from the hills. I don't care if it's historically accurate - if only it would carry me away with the story it chooses to tell. As for watching it strictly as an action movie, well, there's better stuff to choose from. And, we won't even touch the topic of the dialog. Too bad, waste of the talented Pitt and Bloom, but I'm sure they'll go on to better shows."
1,"Wow, This movie is remarkably horrible...","I cannot understand how anyone could really admire this overlong, laughably acted, dreadfully costumed, meandering, Gladiator wannabe, piece of donkey cud ""epic"". It's actually worse than King Arthur and Alexander. Shame on you. Run away.Not only is Orlando Bloom the worst new actor of his generation, but Brad needs to lay off the Botox. The only thing that is impressive about this one is Eric Bana's charismatic presence, before his face is covered in dirt of course."
3,There's ONE reason to see this movie,"I rented this movie on the advice of gay male friends, who highly recommended it. Now I know why. Don't rent this movie for the acting, the plot, the story or really any other production value. Rent it for Brad Pitt. Even if you aren't a Brad Pitt fan - rent it. You may convert.A perfect destruction of the Iliad - almost glorious for that reason. But otherwise a dud. Turn the sound off and enjoy the eye candy in this one."
2,Disappointed,"I saw Troy in the theatre. I thought the production was ok, but I couldn't handle Brad Pitt. I really enjoyed Brad Pitt in Fight Club, Snatch and Ocean's Eleven, but his performance in this was horrendous. I wanted to leave the theatre. This was too ""Hollywood"" and didn't even come close to Gladiator. I was sorely disappointed."
3,"Well, what can I say...?","(...) This movie was good but somehow I think it could have been better. The fight scenes are cool and there's a lot of eye candy for the ladies (no complete frontal nudity, but so much male skin is shown this may as well be a soft porn film for women-and Jesus Christ, I thought to myself in Brad's nude scene, how can a dude be that PERFECT????!!! Ahem, anyway, moving on....). The ending is sort of sad and weird and I've recently discovered that this doesn't do the original story justice-it's innacurate. But I liked it for some reason. I literally don't know how I can describe this movie to you. It's sorta boring but...it's okay. Whatever."
2,Um...,"To be honest, I did not like this movie. At first, it was pretty good...but in the middle, it just got very dull. I seriously was on the verge of falling asleep at some points..."
2,BDAM (Big Dumb American Movie),"What is so wrong with an epic (You know, those stories that have been around for thousands of years that look at the human condition?) that Hollywood believes need improvement? This movie is nothing more than a revenge picture and Achilles is nothing more than a murderous thug. By the end of the movie he has allegedly learned of honor, trust, and understanding. In this we are supposed to find him noble. But, as we all know, thugs do not learn these things. This makes the movie hollow. For the improved version of this movie(...)."
2,Different Musical Score!,"This version of the film has a dramatically different score than the original (some parts of James Horner's score are still there, but many of the key dramatic moments in the film seem completely different with the new score). Nearly all of the vocal elements of the original score have been scrapped, making this Director's Cut seem like your average action movie (the music in the theatrical version is what set it apart from other mediocre action films of the time).The added footage is nice (a lot of the new scenes develop the characters a bit more), but the loss of the original score was a major disappointment for me.I prefer the theatrical version, and I suggest renting this one (or borrowing it from a friend, like I did) before purchasing it."
3,THIS MOVIE IS LONGER THAN THE SIEGE OF TROY,"Peterson does a fine job in getting the epic thing down..this movie is epic...and seriously long. Pitt would at first seem a perfect fit for Achilles, but when you see his petulant, preening, performance, like some bad caracuture of a top runway model, you wonder, would Daniel Craig have been better?..and frankly Pitt's face is showing the ravages of a three pack a day cig. habit, but whatever I always thought his looks where overrated anyway, as for Bana, who played Hector..bravo..he is great, much better that he was in the horrible, Hulk...Brian Cox is great as always and the story is interesting, it is long, yes, but the action keeps the movie afloat so to speek. This movie is not Gladiator, but if all your looking for is a bit of escapism then this may fit the occasion..but think about renting it...if you buy it, im not all together sure you'd want to watch it again, but who knows..your call, your money."
4,The ultimate Greek warrior,"Except for a few flaws, this is a very watchable film that treats the Trojan war from a different perspective.Brad Pitt, in spite of what his detractors may say, is terrific in this film. Nevermind that the film is notan accurate rendition of Homer's epic poem. There are a few limitations between the Blu-ray and the regularDVD. The drum music during the tense combat between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana)is better on the nonBlu-ray version. Overall, anyone interested in an enjoyable, colorful, and exciting film about ancient Greekand Trojan conflict must see this film."
5,Troy history and war and love,"I truly wonder if love and war go ""hand & hand"" through the centuries as depicted in this film. Eve started it all way back at the beginning and so it seems that our lust for a mate creates love which transends rational thought..."
4,Troy,"First of all, I liked this movie. It has a great cast Brad Pitt, Peter o' Toole, and Nigel Terry. If you like the movie Excalibur, I suggest you give this movie a chance. For those who say it's not as good as the Lord of The Rings. If you wait for something to be as good as The Lord of the Rings you'll be waiting a long time. I have no problem saying that this movie is on par with Gladiator. As I said if you like the movie Excalibur, you have a good chance of liking this movie also. Peter O'Toole is great as always. It's nice to see he Nigel Terry again also. (Excalibur, and the TV show Covington Cross.) If you like this movie you might also like Helen of Troy."
1,Disappointing--Don't waste your money getting this on Blu-Ray!,"My girlfriend and I eagerly awaited this release on Blu-ray, since she liked the movie originally, but UGGH--this is so disappointing. For starters, the look on high def is not much different than the DVD release, not enough to be noted anyways. The original theatrical cut of the film was OK, but this directors' cut is so campy--the additions of flowery, CHEESY dialogue did this already poorly rated film NO favors. If you have Netflix and want to support Blu-Ray and encourage Warner Bros. to get off their fence, then add it to your Queue. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS ON BLU-RAY!!"
1,Seriously... why?,"Tell me something: were there really a group of hardcore die-hards of ""Troy"", somewhere in the world, asking Wolfgang Peterson and/or Warner Bros. for a definite edition of this lukewarm toga-fest?I don't know, maybe it's just me, but even rabid Brad Pitt fans don't seem to really care about this flick - not that it's really a bad film per say. It's just... irrelevant. The best scene in the movie, hands down, is that fight between Pitt and Eric Bana; everything else has been DONE TO DEATH in MUCH BETTER pictures.So the idea of another 2-disc edition completely puzzle me... or not - let's face: execs at Warner Bros. would sell out their own mothers to make a buck!"
2,Ex Oriente Lux (Light comes from the East),"Those of you who have seen Troy will probably remember the beautiful sunrises over the Aegean. However when you are actually in Troy-since Troy is to the east of the Aegean-the sun never rises but sets over the sea. We know the movie was not shot in Troy, but couldn't they have as least picked a spot where the sunrises would be consistent with the map they have shown at the beginning of the movie?It is not only the geographical details which have been overlooked in Petersen's Troy. The dialogue is just awful. We watch Greeks and Trojans speak and act like characters from a soap opera, i.e., Helen-who is wearing a Vogue make-up-turns to Paris and says 'last night was a mistake'.I so much wish Peter Jackson took up this very challenging project. I am sure he would have done justice to Homer and would make a great job creating the world depicted in the Illiad."
1,Not even close,"Homer is turning in his grave. The gods, so important to the story, are missing, cutting out most of the characters' motives.The trouble with movies like this, is that children will see it and think this is the real story."
2,Eye Candy,"At the end of Troy I listened to a few young girls behind me weeping at the death of Achilles. I weep for a different reason...I weep for those poor young people who will probably never read ""The Illiad"" and will never really know this movies gross inaccuracies in the telling of a great story. Girls! Paris doesn't valiently kill Achilles then run out under the city of Troy to start over. Hector's wife is taken to Greece as a slave....oh I could go on, but please, take my advice; READ THE BOOK!"
2,Bring a pillow and a blanket!,First let me start off with saying that i love epic films and i was very anxious about seeing this movie. But Boy was i disappointed. The movie drags on for three long hours and i mean 3 very LOOOOng hours. The acting was horrible except for eric Bana who did an excellent job. Brad Pitt sucked and orlando Bloom as paris was nothing but an annoying little wuss. For those who have read the Illiad will find this film very dissappointing for they changed the whole story around to make it more Hollywood. Homer himself wouldn't watch it. He must be turning in his grave.I still can't believe it took 200 million dollars to make this film. they should of concentrated on developng a better storyline and casted better actors with talent.the two stars above are for eric bana and his portrayal of Hector. the movie actually deserves 0 stars.do yourself a favor and don't waste your money to watch this crap film. go watch Shrek instead.
3,Ancient Battles Gap Style,"This movie really has one major flaw...which would be prettified blonde Gap ad Brad Pitt. I've liked him in other movies in the past but here he just seems lost in his character and overwhemed by the stories scope. Eric Bana makes this movie watchable, I feel bad for him for ending up in flops like this and The Hulk because he is actually a decent actor. Orlando Bloom whines like a 3 year old girl the entire film and proves he has little resonace onscreen when he actually has to speak. The cinemotography is excellent and the rest of the supporting cast is good, but there still isn't anything too memorable going on here, this movie could have been a whole lot better, but it could also have been worse."
4,Forget Homer's Iliad and Enjoy the Movie.,"Of course if you look at history and then watch Troy of course you'll see errors. But that's Hollywood for you, they tweek history in every movie.It's a good movie, lots of action and great fight scenes. Brad Pitt & Eric Bana look exceptionally good. Just take it for what is is, good entertainment."
4,Not bad at all,I don't know if this is faithful to the original story or not and quite frankly I couldn't care less. The fighting is sure to keep the guys satisfied and Brad's sex scene is HOH-TT. His face is starting to look a little old but his body is still ripped 'n' cut to the max. So get it. It's good. Mostly.
2,OK Action Flick...VERY loosly based on Homer,"If you are looking for the Iliad, it's not here. The 10 year Trojan war is compressed into a few days. Achilles & Patrocles are cousins instead of lovers, Paris kills Achilles with a volley of arrows instead of just one, Cassandra is not in the movie, etc... The special effects are OK, and some of the casting is well done. I liked the way Achilles fights, but they used the wrong actor to pull it off. I'll probably buy it when it comes out on DVD. The made for TV movie The Odyssey is a better rendition of Homer, if you are interested."
3,Makes Some Excellent Computer Wallpaper,Ok so this film wasn't great. It also wasn't terrible. The most redeeming quality however was the plethora of scenes with Brad Pitt half dressed. I'm speaking solely to the ladies here. I'm sure there were some fine shots of the heroines as well but I really didn't notice. Sorry guys. As for the story I think we all know how it ends and getting to that ending would have been much more tedious if it weren't for all the eye candy.
5,One of my FAVORITES!,"This movie is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES. It actually inspired the names of 2 of my pets. Achilles and Apollo. In this movie Achilles actually chops off the statue of Apollo's head... but..yeah. I LOVE action and ESPECIALLY Greek war movies. Brad Pitt plays a demi-god in this movie! When I heard he was 40!!! When he filmed this I FREAKED out! HOTTIE!! He is shirtless for like half of the movie!! =) Just another reason to love it! Yeah well, its really a good movie for teenage girls (Brad Pitt) and teenage guys (all the fighting). Once again one of my favorites!! Zombieland is tied with this one!!"
4,Awesome Collector's item... lame Director's Cut,"The directors cut is just added footage of the battle sequences and scenes that were cut out for a reason. Sadly, the theatrical cut isn't included. All of this aside, this is an awesome collector's item with plenty of goodies for fans of the film."
1,Wooden,"I rented this DVD before the last blizzard hit, thinking it would be a great way to ride out the storm. Well, what could have been a great epic turned out to be epically boring! I just didn't care about any of the characters and the battle scenes weren't anywhere near as exciting as they could have been, and it was hard to care who won! As far as the story line, where was the explanation for WHY Achilles is such a great warrior and can't be beat? A little detail about his HEEL (hello!) was left out of the story until the very end when he blatently sticks his heel out to take the arrow. It might as well have had a bullseye painted on it! It all seemed so silly! As far as the acting, the only actor worth anything in this movie was Eric Bana. The rest acted like a bunch of wooden horses. Luckily, I also rented ""The Village"" at the same time, but that's another review...."
4,WOW! Great movie with georgous Brad!!,I really liked this movie. I was not a Brad Pitt fan until this movie. He was wonderful in this movie. He seemed so heartless at first then his true self comes out. Wonderful acting. Orlando Bloom's image is tarnished in my eyes now because all the death and destruction occured because of his whinny self. He should have never done this character! He will now be protraid as a bigger whimp in all his future movies even more so then his past performances. I just wished the Trojan King would have listened to his son's instead of the leaders of his whatever you call it and they would have been alive. The ending is truely sad but it is somewhat close to Iliads version (ending only). Overall the movie is a tear jerker and a must watch again in my opinion. I've seen it about 25 times since it came out on cable.
1,An Epic Waste....,"... of time and money, if not talent (said while maintaining Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Legolas in ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy was sublime). One can't help but wonder how much Dino DeLaurentis had to do with this. Yes, it's that bad. Uber Stud Muffin Brad Pitt struts and glares and smolders and generally adds to the charge of ""defamation of character"" for calling himself an actor. Jennifer Aniston, relax: ""You're better off!""""Jason and The Argonauts"" this ain't."
1,What a disgrace.,"Save your money and READ THE BOOK. Achilles is supposed to be wrathful, not a love sick puppy dog as played by pretty boy Brad Pitt."
2,No subtitles in Español,"It's impossible to select the subtitles in Español, like we can read in Main Feature. If somebody know the solution, please help me!"
1,Hollywood Crap,"How did it cost so much to make this movie? The acting, with the exception of Eric Bana was horrible, the music overcame the movie instead of flowing with it. The fight scenes were played out horribly and the directing made the story move along at the pace of a snail, atleast until the end which they rushed entirely too fast. There were maybe two or three redeeming factors of this movie but I was so disappointed. Maybe its because I enjoyed Homer's Illiad, maybe its because I'm a history major. But I think it was because I perfer movies that have smooth dialogue, good acting, and over all a good production, which this one lacked. Brad Pitt can't carry a picture, he's better when he has other actors to lean on and play against. He was definitley miscast. So was Wolfgang Peterson as the director."
1,I'd give this a zero if I could,"Boring.Why does Pitt have a British accent?This movie was a major disappointment. Bloom is ineffectual and the love stories aren't believable. No chemistry among any of the actors. And if I'm supposed to be impressed with digital imagery (the boats, the warriors....) I'm not. The video game is probably cooler. No authentic feel. Terrible."
3,Pretty boy extravaganza.,"Troy is easily an hour too long. Seems they were taking the meaning of epic very seriously. If they weren't going to make a good film, then at least they would make a long one.Not all of Troy is so bad. The action sequences are entertaining. Most of the visuals are pretty good. OK, that's about it. The rest is normal Hollywood summer film fodder. Big stars in a low-substance film. Pretty boys abound here so the ladies won't be disappointed.Brad Pitt is, at best, a mediocre actor. He scored big in 12 monkeys, but that was oh so long ago. No one pouts better than him. No one looks more handsome wielding a sword. Still, don't look for Mr. Pitt around Oscar time.I'm pretty disappointed with Orlando Bloom. The fact that he uses a bow and arrow in Troy doesn't separate him from his Legolas role does it? This elf should try his hand at some serious roles and leave action behind for awhile."
4,Bana Makes this film soar!!!!,Outstanding film thats with great preformances and battle sequences. We have been hit with great films including great battles over the last several years. LOTR put the bar up so high for fims of this type.Troy doesn't disappoint at all. Brad Pitt works well in the title role. The true star to me is Eric Bana he truly shines in his role. I thought the film took a slight hit after Bana's character died (sorry for the spoiler). Sorry not a fan of Mr. Bloom but he plays the weakling brother very well.The movie is beautifuly shot and the action is very fierce.Highly recomended to anyone that likes movies in the same thread.
2,TROJAN MAN!!!,"When my Mom and I went to see this we kept cracking up, the movie was so boring we thought we could make it amusing. Alas, my Mom fell asleep and after about 10 minutes more I couldn't take it, we left the theatre. The only reason this movie gets another star is for Brad Pitt's tasty bod, other than that they shouldn't have used him because his acting was gay. In fact, all the acting was gay, and the cr_p they were trying pull off has been done and done better (Gladiator or Brave Heart anyone?). They tried to make an epic but in my opinion, it didn't work out. Maybe I'd feel differently if I'd seen the whole movie, but I doubt it. I was just glad to get out of the theatre and away from seeing all the fairies on screen."
4,"Historically interesting, Great Action","I really enjoyed the show. It had very good historical information, whether it be myth or truth. The concept of the different types of battles was very unique.I like action movies and this one had ACTION! Brad Pitts was ok Sorry but I am not his fan.But the show over all was Very Good."
2,"TROY, a comedy for the ages.","I had high hopes for this film, considering the cast, but alas, my friend and I made fun of this film out loud for entire 2 hour and 45 minute running time. Funny things was, it was opening night, and the audience was laughing at all our jokes. There should be a revival of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, because this film is great to tease. Best joke invovled the sudden rush of flaming fire balls, and another involved Achilles yelling ""Hector!"" Response: ""Wrong castle, you idiot!""Great movie to make fun of, but in the end, a really cheesy movie."
2,"Tiresome and boring,..","Good special effects but tiresome and boring. If you are a Brad Pitt fan, then by all means ladies, watch this movie. Guys, this means you get a night out!!"
2,"Pleasing, but not an historical account","Two discrepencies are quite obvious. First, the Trojan War consumed ten years. There is no sense of this in the movie. We seem to get around the war in at best a few weeks.Second, where are the gods? The gods were a vital part of Homer's story, but for some reason the gods simply took a hiatus in this movie! First, I wonder whether a modern audience can understand and assimilate the intimate relationship between gods and men in Homer's classic. Perhaps it would have been impossible. Second, I wonder whether modern audiences could take the utter brutality of the Homerian account. I take it not from this movie, since it is certainly a sanatized version of Homer's epic poem.All in all, perhaps no sane person would actually screen the Iliad in a manner that is faithful to the original. But I wish someone had the guts to do so."
2,Peter O'Toole!,"I do not wish to waste too much time telling you what a disappointment this dreadful film was. 5 Stars to Peter O'Toole, once again proving how talentless and un-starlike todays actors are. Rent ""Helen of Troy""!Better yet, see ""Gladiator""."
3,"I liked it, but...","This was quite an entertaining movie, although for some reason I had a hard time with Brad Pitt playing Achillies. I don't have an opinion about him one way or the other, but he just did a lot of...posing.I loved Eric Bana as Hector. When he was killed near the end of the movie, I lost interest in the end of the movie because there was really no one else to root for. There were some parts where I laughed out loud (inappropriately) because some of the dialogue was rather cheesy. But...If you're looking for entertainment, be sure to rent the DVD. It wasn't that bad of a movie, just a little bit long."
5,saw it twice in one weekend and it was awesome,"I loved this movie, saw it back to back days. Brad Pitt was very good. He may be too pretty but he was way cool in this film. The other actors steal the movie, especially the King that Achilles fights for. (...)The action is top notch. The death scenes and fighting sequences are equivalent to Gladiator. Yeah, Orlando Bloom is a sniveling snot. You will hate him because he is such (...). Helen of Troy is OK. I like my women to be more voluptous. Stacked and curvy. She does have a beautiful face. Gladiator #1, Troy #2, Lawrence of Arabia #3 Can't wait to see Alexander The Great next."
2,Didn't like it...sorry.,"I gotta say I love these kind of movies: war, action, complot, romance. I thought this was going to be the best war movie ever. But...everybody makes mistakes. To be sincere, I hated the first 100 minutes of the film, so me and my friends threw candy at each other. I bet all of you liked it, but there are always exceptions. I'm one of 'em."
5,Enjoy,Buy this one will enjoy it very much Enjoy the mythology this one is good as many characters from Greek mythology
3,"Ultimate Edition, yet not available in the best format","If something is labelled as ""Ultimate Edition"" I expect it to have only the best. This set is not available in Blu-Ray. If you want all of the best of Troy you have to buy this AND a seperate Blu-Ray. That's unnacceptable.Beyond that, the extras in this ""'Ultimate' Edition"" are beast."
1,Egad!,"Save your money, unless you want to be one of the few who enjoy guffawing during a serious film. In fact, just that made watching this film entertaining, and there were several of us scattered in the theatre snickering, out-and-out laughing, and lending neighbors some off-handed remarks that spread the giggling. Yes, the battle scenes are spectacular, and the horse/set construction remarkable, but the script, acting, sound track, triteness of the plot, and over-use of 60s tie dyed clothing is bound to make many less critical movie goers squirm with either annoyance or delight, depending on their sense of humor. Enjoy the ride, if you dare!"
1,"WE HATE BIG BUDGET CHEESY, PATHETIC MOVIES",MY GOD! The gates of Troy are 2 inches thick. A 12 year old could knock them down in an instant!
1,Why can't I give it zero stars???,"This film is the most gargantic lump of human-secreted filth that has ever graced anyone's presence. Greek myths are not stories that I enjoy seeing butchered by naked hasbeen Hollywood hunks and new emotionless pretty boys. The actress who played Helen was quite unstunning, and the raving reviews I've heard about this film disgust me. This film disgusts me, and if you like it, YOU ALSO DISGUST ME."
5,Enough is Enough,"Listen I love a Great Sword & Sandal movie and ""Troy"" delivered on all parts, but I get tired of all the Special Editions, Super Special Edition, Directors Cut Super Duper Special Edition and so forth. Release the movie with the Unrated Edition and leave it at that. If these additional scenes were so good they should've been in the movie in the 1st.place."
2,waste of time,"I saw this movie four times in the theaters. I don't know how I survived sitting through it. I only went because my two friends are obsessed with Orlando Bloom. One of the worst actors today. This movie just turned into another hollywood action cliche. The battle scenes, while at some points thrilling, mainly just fall flat. This movie is just a waste of time. I recommend maybe one viewing of it. Then go out and rent ""Gladiator"" and you'll see which one is better."
2,Boring,"I knew that this movie had removed itself from The Iliad, but that didn't bother me.What did bother me was how unappealing almost everything about this movie was.Achilles was a spoilt, egotistical, self-obsessed brat, Agamemnon a boorish braggart, as was his brother, Helen was just plain boring, Andromache looked like she'd just collapsed on the catwalk and was waiting to be force-fed, and Paris was a non-entity (I really don't think Orlando Bloom can act). The only appealing character was Hector.The large-scale battle scenes were okay, but I got sick of the pretty boy posturing and ludicrous balletic moves (of Achilles) in the showdown between Achilles and Hector.About half way throught he movie I started fast-forwarding, which I NEVER do. I just found it boring."
1,wait for it in the clearance bin,"This was a horrible movie. Believe the reviewers on this site that have given it 1 or 2 stars. They are correct in their assessments. What a waste that tons of money was spent on terrible acting, directing, production, etc. etc. I laughed through most of it because of the riduculous characters and the stupid sound track. The female ""wailing"" voice was incredibly annoying...as was everything else in this movie."
1,A 3-Hour Bore,"OK - it was good to see cast members from Braveheart and Lord of the Rings again, Peter O'Toole and Nigel Terry were nice touches, and Brad Pitt had a few good athletic moves as Achilles - but this was NOT the epic movie that the studio and Wolfgang Peterson were hoping for. Had it not been for my husband being deaf in one ear and mistaking my request to leave for an inquiry if he was bored too, we would have walked out of the theatre. Even the young girls who (I'm quite certain) came to see Orlando Bloom were silent.I would recommend seeing Universal's Helen of Troy that was aired on cable over this version. It's available on DVD and tells a much richer, more satisfying version of the story."
2,Poor Brad,"Brad will have to continue looking for a role that suits his talents to get him back on top again. He was not believable as Achilles. The screenwriter(s) took too much poetic license with the story, as was pointed out by my 16 year old son who actually read the Illiad and the Odyssey.Action scenes were hardly worthy of a Saturday afternoon made-for-TV movie.Even my wife, who loves Brad pitt (ala: Legends of the Fall), disliked him in this role."
1,An Epic Cartoon,"This movie has nearly every gladiator-movie cliche incorporated into its lavish fabric, including the ""beautiful woman gets her relatives slaughtered but then in 2 days becomes the lover of their murderer."" Apparently the money spent on the big name stars, special effects, and set left little or nothing for a script and story-line."
2,"A ""Gladiator"" Rip-Off","First of all, American actors suck! They are self-absorbed, immature and the current crop of male actors seem like eternal old teen-agers. The British are by far the best actors in all the world, with their intensity, maturity and strong personalities, but they couldn't save this movie.Brad Pitt was not believable to me. In each scene, he seemed to be preening and posing himself in the best light. With the long blond hair, he looked for all the world like a California surfer dude. With his current success, he seems not to be trying anymore to find the soul of the character as he did in ""Legends of the Fall.""The battle scenes I liked except the director got in too close and it got claustrophobic. The battle scenes in ""Gladiator"" (which this movie emulates) were much better. I was not familiar with this story, but the script made it easy to follow, except there was just no soul in this movie and there was in ""Gladiator."""
2,Blah.....just...blah,"Well, I won't sit here and explain the story to you. By now you know of the ""Face that launched a thousand ships."" But really, WHERE was the actual STORY of the Illiad or even TROY?All I remember about the movie is Achilles (spelling?) prancing around in his almost naked garb. He was so against fighting this war, but then his cousin gets killed, and it's now an all-out battlefield, but remains finding a glorious death? Hmmmm...A little strange. I don't think that Homer would be too happy with this depiction of his incredible masterpiece.This movie was WAY too long for it juvenile plot. I was expecting to see a beautifully crafted materpiece, epic, and adventure. But all I got was horrible dialogue and pretty faces. Now, I don't mind the pretty faces, but I'd rather not have high expectations and with $7.50 out of my pocket."
2,The only good scene in this movie,"I think we'd all be lying, even the staunchest critics, if we said we weren't giddy during the Trojan horse sequence. The takeover of Troy was exciting, and Odysseus came off like a cool guy, and then it toppled downhill when Achilles jumped out of the horse. Ummm...Achilles was dead by then, well, at least according to this book called ""The Illiad."""
4,The Battle of Troy,"Most likely the largest ammount of soliders in a war I ever seen in a movie.It wasn't to bloody but a nice clean movie.Yes they show blood and spears through heads and whatever not , but I woyuldn't own it just for the simple fact it's 162 minutes long and I won't ever watch it again.Brad Pitt played his part very well as the best warrior of the world.He was badd-azz.Rent this movie only."
3,Lots of eye candy but it could've been better,"As a lover of the old Greek/Roman epics it was good to see a modern one. This movie isn't much different from the old Hollywood versions so I won't quibble with the story changes to the Iliad. However to make it work the acting has to be stellar. Eric Bana delivers but Bloom and especially Pitt don't add a lot to the movie. I wanted to like Pitt, he clearly took the part seriously and worked at it. However I found is acting wooden and his character uninteresting. Bloom didn't show the charisma that would make Helen run away with him. The fight scenes were stages well and the scenery was magnificent. Too bad the lead couldn't make the story compelling."
3,3 Stars for cinematography,"1 star for Hollywood ALWAYS making ancient Greeks and Romans speak in English accents. Whay must they also always make the leads blond hair and blue eyed Europeans and keep the dark-haired Euro/Afro-Asiatic Greeks who looke more like the real deal in the background? They do this in all films. In Egyptian movies, they make the leads white and have the Africans play the back. Foolishness!Not only that, but I hate it when Hollywood makes movies such as these and rewrites history and writes scripts to make the characters reference their places in history, as if they all knew it back then. No wonder this flopped.I don't even want to talk about the acting. Pitt sucks. People keep changing their accents all of the time, except for the British actors of course. Greece and Rome is not Britain. The British did not even know who they were or where they were when Greec and Rome were going on."
1,Huh???,"First of all i'm not a kid i'm actually 17 but i didn't want to register. Now to the point, this movie sucked. They totally killed the illiad, first of all they should have called this movie achilles thats the only what they focus on. Ohh yeah and the damn greeks look like friggin asians with oddly shaped shields. What happened to the famous greek phalanx? The greeks in this movie were just an unorganized mob. Another thing, AGAMEMNON IS NOT SUPOSED TO DIE!!!!!!!!! What the hell!! Also the siege of troy lasted 10 years this lasted like 3 days. And another thing they left out the gods, the gods played a huge role in the iliad. Lets see what did i forget oh yeh western Turkey isn't a friggin desert.Troy was by a river not in the middle of a desert. Im sure if i sat here i could destroy this movie more but, i think you get the point. Don't buy this movie. If you must see it rent it."
2,I can see why certain things were cut.,"I wish they would've had this to rent. The comments on here convinced me to buy it, that it was worth it. You guys praised the way the extra scenes ""fleshed out the characters and story."" However, what you guys failed to mention was that the additional flesh wasn't all new scenes. There was more nudity in this extended version than I was comfortable with. Now I'm torn between recouping some of my losses by selling my copy of this product to a pawn shop, or throwing it in the trash. The latter would be the more ethical choice."
2,TROY,"Originally we were sent the wrong movie but told we could keep ""300"" and they would reorder and send us the right one. This took several days to clear up the situation and my husband was not very pleased in the length of time it took to get his birthday present. Though I appreciated their gesture of keeping the first dvd, we did not enujoy it and ultimately gave it away while waiting for Troy. I would question doing business with them honestly."
1,Troy,"This was an awful movie. One of the worst movies Brad Pitt has ever been in. Which is really to bad considering he has done so much in other movies. The acting was terrrible, the dialogue couldn't have been worse, the movie strays so far away from the book. The only good thing that came from this movie was the fight seen between Bana and Pitt."
1,good example of Sturgeon's Law,"Somebody once leveled the following criticism of science fiction against sci-fi author Theodore Sturgeon: ""ninety percent of everything written in sci-fi is crud."" To which Sturgeon supposedly replied, ""But ninety percent of EVERYTHING is crud!""The remark took on a life of its own, and now even has it's own Wikipedia page as ""Sturgeon's Law.""Anyhow, Brad Pitt's ""Troy"" is an good example of it.About 10% is fantastic and really worth seeing, especially if you're reading the Iliad and would just like to get some good visuals:1. Achilles killing the Thessalian hero at the beginning.2. All the ships sailing upon Troy.3. The actual sack of Troy.But the other 90%? Crud."
2,Eye candy for the ladies,"The plot is weak - but it looks good. Gone is the high drama of the Iliad with it's contest of wills between the Greeks and the Gods, all of whom indulge their petty human (and intriguing) emotions. This movie seems designed for one thing - to show off Brad Pitt as a sex symbol. Brad Pitt's Achilles is dark, and even bloodthirsty at times, but not as manly as Russell Crowe's Maximus. Manliness is sorely needed in this film (Bana, Pitt, and Bloom together don't pump as much testosterone as Mel Gibson in Braveheart). Brian Cox as Agememnon and Peter O'Toole as Priam are the only acting performances of note. Diane Kruger's Helen is mute and passionless - and she's the reason for all the to-do? But the musical score is very good - especially for the climactic fight between Pitt and Bana- and the scenery is magnificent. Rent it - one watching will be enough."
3,i agree,"I have read the iliad more times than the newspaper, and this is not the epic trojan war that i know, its a fun movie, but not accurate, except for people names and the setting (that would be troy). upon my saying that, get it, cause you might be intruiged enough to learn and read the real trojan war, and not wolfgang petersons trojan war"
2,Wait for the DVD...,"so you may fast forward through the slow parts. The battle scenes are good, not great after LOTR set the standard. Many slow scenes with repetitive dialogue about the meaning of war, what is killing good for, etc. There are gratuitous scenes of Brad Pitt's physique for those who would get a thrill out of it.There is very little historical accuracy, realizing it would take a 22 hour movie to try and get it right. You would hope they would at least try some of the easy historical depictions...like it took 9 years to get to the Trojan Horse, Ajax commits suicide after Achilles death, Achilles sends Patroclus to fight for him, not the way depicted, but directorial laziness prevented any of historically similar scenes from being attempted."
4,A lot of fun,"First of all this movie is a lot of fun to watch - even at close to 3 hours long it goes by fast. While I know this movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, the one star givers need to lighten up! IT'S A MOVIE not a documentary - if you want that go to A&E or BBC. While I do not know much about the history of the Trojan war, as an educated professional, this movie did not insult my intelligence. The only reason I would not give this movie 5 stars is the simple fact that I seriously feel Brad Pitt was miscast as Achilles. I do not dislike him (I just think he is better suited to the ""Oceans ELeven"" roles), but the fact that whenever he would come on screen, I would think ""oh, it's brad Pitt"" really destroyed his credibility as Achilles. I however did enjoy the masterful portrayals by Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole as Hector and King Priam. Hopefully the seldom cast Eric Bana will get better gigs after this film."
5,Funny and Pleasing to All,"This is a brilliant little book, and I highly recommend it to those who love great artwork and wonderful rhymes to read aloud or sing to your children. The story is wonderful as well. The word ""hop"" is rhymed with a number of other words, and when they get to hop on pop, there is no antagonism from Pop about this all. A great book for all!!!"
4,Hop on Pop is the Top!,"We read Hop on Pop by Dr. Seuss together in our first grade class. While Mrs. Ashley read it to us we giggled because we thought it was so funny. Hannah loved the part where the main character sat on a cat. Jake thought the page where the characters jumped on Pop's belly was funny too. Rylei said the book had lots of rhyming words in it like, ""Red, Ned, and Bed."" We read a lot of Dr. Seuss books during our celebration of his birthday, and this was one of our favorites. *Check out the audio cassette/cd of this book too. I has great sound effects!"
3,Hop on Pop Review,"This is a book review on Hop on Pop .By Dr.SeussThis book to me is very enjoyable. I think this bookis perfect for all kids between 2 and 6.And maybepeople would like to read it to their grand kids.Even the pictures in this book are fun to look at.They're even better than Captain UnderpantsComics. And the drawings are better too.My favorite quote is...""Pat, Cat, Pat sat on Cat"""
2,not the full story,"We asked if these were the regular books and we were told they were, but they don't have the full story because they are the board books. It's disappointing."
1,Not a Suess book,"If you expect to find the real Hop On Pop in this book you will be greatly disappointed. The only nice part about this book is that it pops up. Save your money and stick with the real Hop on Pop, which is a geat book especially for beginning readers."
5,Love this book,I always enjoyed this book as a child and couldn't wait to share it with my children. We love to read together.
3,very tiny book,This book isnt the size I thought it was going to be.... its about 3 x 3....I guess I should of checked the measurements.
2,Hop On Pop,"A Book Review About Hop On PopHop On Pop is one of the greatest books Dr. Seuss has wrote. I think children that are 2-6 years old. This book has so good pictures if you read it to a baby he or she says ""pretty colors."" If you read it , it might make you laugh because one sentence says "" House , mouse house on mouse."" This is my book review about Hop On Pop."
4,excelent,"This book is extremly GREAT!!! This book teaches kids to read even better and helps anoy thier parents with thier ryming. The book basicaly it takes two to three words that ryme and takes and puts it in to a sentence that kind of makes sence yet some times untrue. Yet it is still a great book. Also it teaches, some times, kids when something is in, out, on, or under. it is a great book no matter how you rate it"
5,hopping on pop,"THis is a wonderful childrens story! I read every night when I was younger! this story has to be Dr. Seuss' best work! I love this book and no matter what age, you will fall in love with it to."
1,THIS VERSION IS ABRIDGED!!,"I will have to go get my son the large version of this book before I'll know exactly how many pages have been omitted. There are at least two pages missing, and this is reason enough to AVOID this board book and get the larger version.The two pages that are missing: ""ALL TALL - We all are tall"" and ""ALL SMALL - We all are small"". You will notice (in the full version)that the characters introduced on these two pages continue on to the next two pages playing BALL on a WALL. In this truncated version of the book, the wall is their only appearance.PASS on this edition, or you will not get the full text and images your child should be enjoying in their entirety."
3,Some things just don't translate,"This review is of the Chinese - English edition. My 18-month-old, who lives in a Chinese-speaking household, adores the English version of Hop on Pop. We must read it again and again, approximately one million times a day. So we thought she might enjoy it in Chinese.I knew we were in trouble when ""Up Pup, Pup is up"" was translated as ""shang xiao gou, Xiao gou tiao shang."" It's perfectly fine Chinese, but it has no Seussian style. And it evokes howls of protest.If you're going to buy the Chinese version, check the seller reviews to find one where customers complain about receiving Chinese books. When I ordered, at least one seller had in his item description ""This book is in English."""
4,hop on pop,I liked this book because it was funny i did not like this book because it kept going over and over this book was about hoping.
2,Not Hop on Pop,"Like the other reviewers said, it's not Hop on Pop. I got both this and the ""real"" hop on pop for my husband for his first fathers day. I think this one will be nice while she is little because it is shorter (shorter attention span) but don't think it is the real version."
4,Fun book,I have the longer original book but the shorter board book still has a lot of the original story. It has the cute poems that help teach language. It has fun brightly colored pictures to interest infants. My son laughs at all the silly phrases that his dad and I get tongue tied over.
2,Not the right story line,"Apparently through the years they have changed the story line, I remember Hop on Pop had a distinct cute little story line but this is not the same as I remember."
3,Hop on pop,This book Hop on Pop is kind of like one big poem. This book rhymes like a poem and makes it fun. I would recommend this book for ages three to seven. Because eight year olds would think it was a little childish. The book Hop on Pop teaches you to to have fun and how to use your imagination like a house on a mouse. This book was good.
1,Amazon is overcharging this book!,"I won't order these books, because the cover price is $7.99 U.S. and Amazon is asking $8.99. Look at the preview and check out the back cover and see for yourself!! They might have free shipping, but they're charging a dollar more than cover price. The books are great, but what's Amazon's problem? This makes absolutely no sense to me. I generally have nothing but good things to say about Amazon.com, but this is just ridiculous."
3,"review of ""Hop on Pop""","I reviewed the book ""HOP on POP"" written by Dr. SeussDr. Seuss is a talented man he wrote great stories. One like ""Hop on Pop"" it is a funny book. This book is great for kids ages of 1-5 maybe even for odder people too."
1,Not Bound Correctly,"I just received this book I ordered for my Grandson. It is not bound correctly as the pages are 1/4 of an inch above the book cover. It is also a small book, not the big full sized book I expected. This is the first time I am really disappointed in the Quality of this product.Hop on Pop"
3,The Poems are way too short,"I bought Hop On Pop (1963)at Target drug stores around Dr. Suess' 99th birthday because I totally admire the books by Theodore Suesss Giesl (Dr. Suess)(1904-1991).But the poems are way too short.I don't HATE this book,but it's not really one of my favorites.The illustrations were well done but the poems wern't really much of poems.they just have two rhyming words then a sentance using the words.For example:""All/Tall/We are all tall"".Sometimes there's a word in a sentance that's not in the rhymes(Example:""Pat/Sat/Pat sat on bat."").Sometimes they even use a rhyming wordthat is not used in a sentance(Example:""Ball/Wall/Up on a wall."").If you're gonna go buy a Dr.Suess Begginer or Bright And Early book,buy The Cat In The Hat (1957) or Oh,The Thinks You Can Think!(1975)because I like those two a lot more."
5,Pat is the Bomb,"Much has been said about the merits of this book for toddlers. However, it is little known that HOP ON POP contains within its time-hallowed pages the veritable SPECIAL MAN OF OUR TIMES.Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the extraordinarily talented PAT, who has within him the power to save the world. He does this by SITTING ON THINGS, such as bats, hats, and cats. Even the admonition of ""No, PAT, no! Don't sit on that!"" Will not faze him.But I digress. Buy the book for yourself. Witness the brilliant spectacle that is PAT. Fall to your knees."
2,Not really a large-print book,"I ordered this book for my grandchild who is visually impaired and has low vision. I was really unhappy to discover that the print is no larger than the original version. Yes the print is somewhat bigger than most Dr. Seuss books, but this book should not be sold as a large-print book without that explanation. Also, I believe I paid more for it as a large-print book than I would have paid for the original."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Parental physical abuse recommended.Or, go and jump on the old folks, young 'uns. Dr Seuss is up to his usual old rhyming stuff here, with yet another weird outing of loopy characters, with, of course, a couple of the midget variety being the point here."
4,This is a book review of Hop On Pop,A book review of Dr. Seuss's book of Hop On PopThis is a book review on one of Dr. Seuss's book called `Hop On Pop'. It is a great book for children ages 2-6. Children would think this book is great because it can be good for grandparents to read it to their grandchildren or they can read it to refresh their child memories. It can be a great book for children because it can be fun for little children to read and to read it to other people that didn't read it.
5,loved by this reading specialist,"I'm a children's reading specialist and author. I love this book for all the reasons other reviewers give, and for one more. -""Hop On Pop"" teaches your child about ""word families"". He sees that once he gets the hang of a reading chunk like ""op"" he can read whole families of words like ""hop"" and ""pop"" and, well I'm sure you get the picture. On the inside covers Dr Seuss even lists several nice word families so you can familiarize your child with them ahead of reading the pages. Ta,da! -A great book to have your child read once he's comfortable with very beginning words like ""an"", ""at"" and ""and"". (Remember to explain that some words, like ""they"" and ""was"", don't sound out)."
5,Learning with Joy!,"This book should be a 'must have' in all households with children. Silly, fun illustratins liven up every page as you skip through with pure reading enjoyment. Childen learn, without knowing they are learning. They giggle and wait with great anticipation for the next page. Outstanding book.A true keepsake.Shirley Johnson"
3,FIghter lineups for this DVD,"Again, I'd feel redundant belaboring the on-again-off-again quality of the production on these DVDs, already well noted in the reviews of the box set, so I'll just provide lineups...ALTERNATESMartin v RamierezGarcia v BoninMoskowitz v HarrisTOURNAMENTRosier v DorrLydick v MaciasMcGlaughlin v KnorrGassaway v PacholikHEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIPLober v Fawcett"
4,Easy for beginners,This book was the first I bougth and I find it easy to follow specially I didn't know anything about stained glass craft. The projects are easy-to-follow. In general an excellent book.
4,Blurring the line between Unions and the National State,"Peronism managed to control the Union movement in Argentina. Working from the national state, Perón moved to legalize long-sought rights of Argentine workers (like paid yearly vacations). He also took the time to crush or isolate any dissent with him within the Union movement. And guaranteed to the Union ""bosses"" some privileges (like having only one Union legalized for each kind of workers).The book tells the story."
2,Not What Ernest Jones Taught!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mr. De La Torre is a real gentleman and has been praised by many as a fine golf instructor. However, like so many other ""Ernest Jones"" instructors, including Jim Flick, Mr. De La Torre doesn't fully understand Jones' teachings and the importance of feeling the clubhead with your hands. As Jones stated in his book, Swing The Clubhead, ""Your hands are everything in this business of playing good golf easily."" Mr. De La Torre cannot be teaching students to swing the clubhead with ""the arms on the downswing,"" and, at the same time, claiming to be a disciple of Jones, who I am sure is turning over in his grave! This thought only adds complexity to learning the correct swing. Any golfer, who really wants to learn the simplified method of Ernest Jones, should track down PGA teaching professional, Arnie Frankel, in Hobe Sound, Fl. He is a ""true"" disciple of Ernest Jones!!!"
2,"Pass on this, there are many better books out there","Having read two dozen or more instructional golf swing books, I would have to say this was the least helpful.Not mechanically specific, and not applicable to day to day practice. I would encourage potential buyers to pass and try others.For conventional swing technique try Swing Like a Pro by Ralph Mann & Fred Griffin (excellent illustrations) .For an easier but unconventional teaching, The Secret of the Golf Swing by John Dunigan. IMHO this is the best book on the golf swing out there. (plus the Pelz book for short game)"
3,Lacking just a little...,"Like many other reviewers here, I have read a number of golf instruction books. I bought this one because of the reviews on Amazon. The reason I give it three stars is because to me it lacks visual examples that make sense and are easy to comprehend. The best photos are the ones relative to his grip style which is vastly different from most instructors - both v's pointing to the midline. Also, the explanation of using the hands for the back swing and the arms for the forward swing leaves something to be desired. It all sounds good but when you go out and try it based on what you've read, it can confuse those who have been playing for a while and want to improve. I'm not saying that I don't think Manuel's style doesn't work. What I am saying is that it is still not as easy as Keeping It Simple Stupid. I'm not Stupid and Golf is not Simple!!! If it were, we would all be playin like Tiger."
4,Bad back golf,Manuel presents a simpler swing which I was looking for to help my bad back. Gives practical advice and help for the entire game.
2,Not Really Ernest,"Mr. De La Torre claims to teach the Ernest Jones method (which produced numerous national champions on both sides of the Atlantic) but then pollutes the Jones method by taking the hands out of the downswing. After unsuccesfully trying Manuel's method for a while, I happened upon Arnie Frankel's Golf's One Motion video. It is a much more straight forward presentation of the Jones method. Understanding the Golf Swing misses the mark."
5,Got the DVD too,My sister was given this one....she just started to play golf. Got her the DVD too but she says she took the book with her on the plane when she had that business trip and it was a Great read!
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"After reading the rave on-line reviews about this book I finally bought it and read it cover to cover. I'm now convinced that all the other reviews were written by employees of the publisher or members of the author's family. There is nothing new here, but unlike the thousands of other similarly mediocre golf books this one includes few diagrams or photos to illustrate the swing mechanics or other difficult concepts. Most of the book is a set of bullet lists containing all the trite dogmatic views you might hear from the high-handicappers on your local municipal course. Save your money and buy Hogan's ""Five Lessons"" or Peltz's ""Short-game Bible"", they will help you infinitely more than this book."
1,There is only one Ernest Jones Method,"Mr. De La Torre claims to be a proponent of the Ernest Jones method. Any resemblance between what Mr. De La Torre has written and the ""true"" Ernest Jones method are accidental at best. In fact he contradicts Mr. Jones teachings on several occassions.If you are expecting to find the wisdom of Ernest Jones here you will be rather dissapointed."
3,Not What I Expected,"I am a big fan of Wally Armstrong who was definitely influenced by Ernest Jones and Manuel De La Torre. Ernest Jones taught centrifigal force of the golf swing by teaching his students how to swing a pen knife attached to a towel. Manuel De La Torre used a string tied to a wiffle ball. (He briefly touches upon that in this book.) Wally Armstrong now sells the Tempo Ball. A yellow ball attached to a rope attached to a plastic golf handle. It teaches the proper swing motion and what swinging the club head means. I think it would have been much more helpful in Manuel De La Torre could have expounded upon that concept but then again, swinging the tempo ball grooves the correct swing without having to think about it. In ""Understanding The Golf Swing"" I found it confusing to swing the club back with the hands and then forward with the arms."
3,Not what I expected ...either,"I agree with the previous reviewer that what De La Torre teaches isn't really close to what Ernest Jones prescribes. Not that it's a bad book - it's just that I bought it in hopes of elaborating on the Swing the Clubhead concept - which it just briefly touches upon.Maybe I should start reading the reviews ""before"" I buy the books."
5,Impressive,"How can you pretend to love reggae and not having this album in store or not knowing U-roy? This is for me one of the greatest reggae albums from Natty Rebel, Badie boo, jah jah say, Babylon burning oh my!!!! All these bring back my childhood and I know west africa, central africa, south and east africa would shake their booo boo hearing these songs. Just impressive."
5,Beautiful book,This is a beautiful book - the illustrations add so much depth to the words of MLK's speech - fantastic for reading aloud.
1,I have a dream too,"That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book.This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her."
5,"Great work,Ellis!","Tinsley Ellis,was a great surprise for me.I've bougth his album ""Trouble Time"",but this one,the debut album of Ellis at Alligator,is better and most bluesiest than the other. Tinsley really must be at the side of that special guitar heroes of the blues scenery. I'd liked specially the last track of the album, a new version of a music that i've heard before at Gary Moore's tribute to Peter Green!Only this ""Lucky Lou"" music,pays all the cost of this great album. Really a great blues work!"
1,Not What I Expected,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I am a huge Isaac Hayes fan, but the music quality on this DVD was bad and the picture was very dark. The concert in general was pretty good, but it's hard to enjoy because of the poor quality of the DVD."
4,Girls Gone Wild. Is it it worth it?,"Girls Gone Wild - College Spring Break (Unrated Edition) delivers exactly what it advertises. Girls, gone wild. If you are looking to see hundreds of beautiful women in their birthday suits, this is the DVD for you. However, if you are looking for extremely erotic content this might not be what you are looking for. Although some of the women do get nasty (this being the unrated edition) in front of the camera, most of the DVD is girls flashing their breasts. To conclude, this is a great DVD if you want to see beautiful women in the buff."
3,"Well assembled, but tiresome reading","The author has done a great job putting together historical ideas related to the Great Pyramid. However, the book rambles too much with so many mythological examples. The tables drone on and on, and the reader is left wondering where he has been and where he is going. The text would be better if it had focused only on decoding the Great Pyramid, and not trying to address every ancient symbolism that came to the author's mind. There are so many sidebars that you aren't sure what to read as you turn each page. I was looking for a book that gave me the facts, drawings, figures and historical data about the pyramid itself. This book's predisposition is mostly mythological. In the book, the appendices are the best part for the text. The book does not have a lot of photos concerning the pyramid, but it does have many drawings, illustrations and tables."
2,not worth,"i bought it just by thinking that different shapes of cookies or bread will make my child to eat it by interest,but its too large in shape n the quality too is not so good.its not worth of $10. i'll suggest that pls get it in small size otherwise its just a waste."
3,Good for cookies,"There are lots of great animals in this collection!!! Good for making cookies. However, the shapes are not thick and do not cut through sandwiches .... they get about 1/2 way through and then stop because of the plastic lip on the shapes. OK product."
4,Great Cookie Cutter Set,"The set of cookie cutters arrived quickly in good condition. It is exactly what I ordered. Big plastic cookie cutters that would be easy for a child to use, and in my opinion safer for kids than the metal ones. Sure to provide hours of Cookie Cooking fun for me and my daughter."
3,Huge cutter,"I should say the cutters are unexpected huge. I've not tried using it yet, but I'm wondering if I should use it for doing the cookies. My little one seems to be very interested in it as there're many animals and now it's her toy."
2,Disappointing,"After weeks of rocking out to 100 Broken Windows, I found myself at Best Buy and came across The Remote Part. I figured it was a gimme purchase, since the previous album was so phenomenal and such a clear demonstration of tremendous talent. Well, I got hosed. The Remote Part is so depressingly average, so obvious, so, ultimately, boring. Where 100 Broken Windows had incredible life and energy, Remote Part has tired ideas and uninspired execution. None of the passion of 100 Broken Windows is to be found anywhere on this album. As other reviewers have mentioned, it appears that Idlewild have indeed attempted to go mainstream, and have thus dumbed down both their music and lyrics in an attempt to be the next, I don't know, Coldplay or something. And judging by the 4.5 star rating this album is currently receiving, maybe they've succeeded. But for anyone who's heard 100 Broken Windows, The Remote Part can only be considered a failure. And a shame."
1,Horrible,"This is a mixture of trying to incoporate the Smashing Pumpkins into one song, and a bunch of other bands in the others. Achieving a sound of being entirely uninspiring, predictable, boring to say the least, and lacking any kind of distinction. They have the talent to create something, but they're sort of just sitting around trying to sound like all their favourite influences. That's fine if you're sincere, but the question here is are they or as someone said, do they just want to be featured on the O.C's soundtrack."
5,Brilliant,"Idlewild's latest album is definitely their best yet. A slight change from past journeys, I'd say they matured their sound instead of selling out. Anyone who thinks that they have weakened their sound at all can have a listen to ""Modern Way of Letting Go"". Emotion and melody are all over this album, achieving perfection in songs like ""American English"" and ""Live In a Hising Place"". The shiniest gem on this album though is definitely the closer ""In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction"". One of the prettiest songs ever written, it is already becoming an all time favorite of mine. The spoken poem at the conclusion of this song is so well delivered through the mesh of guitars, it creates this ghost-like effect. More upbeat songs like ""You Held the World In Your Arms"" and ""Modern Way of Letting Go"" brighten up the album. Can I say enough about this album?....absolutely not. So go get this album to see what I'm talking about, and make it one of your favorite albums as well."
3,Greatness comes from within,"Idlewild are a band who don't pretend to be anything they're not.They don't dress themselves in expensive clothes.They don't dress their songs in expensive sounds.The truth be told there's so much honesty in what they write it's hard to understand why they're nothing but an echo in the pool of music.Their third (actually fourth) album 'The Remote Part' is a progression in their songwriting and their sound.The first album was much rawer affair but they're refining themselves into something which can be considered as mainstream with songs such as 'American English' and 'Live in a hiding place', much like REM did during their earlier carrear.Perhaps we will see a similar future for the scottish group.Currently supporting Coldplay on their 'Rush of blood to the head' tour they're well worth seeing if you get the chance.Go and buyThree and a half stars"
3,Overripe,"""Hope Is Important"" was just a little too unrefined. ""100 Broken Windows"" was a near-perfect blend of punk-like musical brusqueness with endearing overtones of harmony and melodicism. And here in Chapter Three we find our heroes apparently heading disappointingly down the road toward radio-friendliness and, as the Amazon editorial reviewer notes, 'bid[ding] for wider acclaim'. The writing's on the wall, it seems, and I'm already planning on NOT buying their next one. Fortunately, this CD has enough appeal for me that I don't regret too badly purchasing it; they haven't completely lost their edge. However their ""edge"" supply appears to be down to about 1/4 tank..."
5,Only one song that isn't 5 star caliber,"Finally, Idlewild have put all their strengths together into a wonderful record from start to finish. The former two records have been solid, but lacked the cohesiveness to be considered in ""top ten of the year"" talk. Roddy's range is evident, but the tracks flow seamlessly. I love the mature and calculated direction they are going, unlike bands such as Ash (who used to be great). Cashing in on the trends has got to be difficult to resist in the music industry, and Idlewild could have fallen victim by catering to the emo crowd and the angst ridden kiddies. I have not seen a release date domestically, but given the right record label backing, it could be huge in the States as well as the UK. By the way, the Coldplay comparison is unwarranted. Writing songs with heart that you need a mind to fully appreciate would be one of few similarities."
2,"good album, but.....","Capital is a bunch of money grubbers who copy protect so that I can't play this on any of my computers or old CD player. I'm not even talking about ripping, just playing. I can only listen to it in my car, or buy a newer CD player just for these copy protected CDs... I'm frankly disgusted and will be avoiding purchases from the Capital label!"
3,this album is alright,"hi. im currently the tour guy with the paladins and this album is alright. its worth buying definately, but its more on the blues side to me than rockabilly. i like the rockabilly more. its still a hard driving record though, but my favorite is still the 1st record, the paladins. years since yesterday is my 2nd favorite."
3,Social smarts,"Little outdated ... The general population of kids today are without courtesy and rude, so this book will only touch upon those that care.I have it for my two kids and they read it, but we are also strong in teaching our children good social skills and courtesy. I find this book helpful, and leave it on the sofa table for them to pick up and read at their leisure.It is sad to say, when you meet kids who don't have good social skills, this book does NO GOOD. My kids feel offended that other kids are rude and this book does not introduce ways for kids to deal with other rude kids, to gain positive responses and learn from manners, or to exhibit to others how the rude child can change their mannerism. Suggestions should be offered to kids to teach them how to handle people with inappropriate behavior in a positive way."
3,Good Trick That Wears Off In Time,"This album floored me when I first heard it, but shrunk in stature over time. The trick is he hammers the strings with his fingers, so he's able to play bass lines and melody at the same time. (Borrowed a little from bluesman Robert Johnson). This works on ""Elenor Rigby"" but grows a little stale on ""Freddie Freeloader"" or ""Fundance."" ""Return Expedition"" is a good sampler as well, in which he flies off in a improvisational solo that defies gravity. But the rest of the album seems too mannered and disappears into the background."
5,THE TRUE AIR JORDAN,Stanley Jordan's Guitar Playing&Vibe Glide High into the Air on this set.His Playing is Really Great here.I Dug His Take on Michael Jackson's THE LADY IN MY LIFE&THE BEATLES ELEANOR RIGBY.HE IS A GREAT TALENT.
1,Now this makes a lot of sense....,"okay, this show is good. However, the DVD is not, and that is why i have given this release one star. Otherwise i would give the show itself 5 stars. I guess if you want to continue collecting the show if you have (or even if you dont' have) the last son of krypton disc. This contains eps. 4-7 i believe, and is a worthless buy. why? well, ponder this. On january 25th the first 18 eps. will be coming out in a boxed set with the following box sets in approximately 5-10 months apart (per release)from the january release There will be three box sets of 18 to equal the 55 eps. this show had. Or you could just wait and get 4 new eps. every 6 months. Your choice. 3 box sets...or 15-20 individual discs...."
2,"Excellent Animated Series, annoying DVD releases","There is nothing better than Animation complete Box Sets on DVD, but Warner and other companies with other DVD titles insist in releasing those horrible discs with random, separeted episodes. It's pretty bad those masterpieces (like Superman, Batman and Marvel 90's cartoons) were being treated this way. But fortunately, the Series Collections is coming out in January, so I suggest to keep your money and wait for it."
5,A must have! Five stars!,"This is her second album! it's a great one too! I own it and I absolutely love it. This album showcases her musical zenith, perfectly matching fashion requirements with creative aspirations. She's in perfect soulful harmony on this album and provides a cutting edge groove for the dancefloors. Although Thought 'Ya Knew didn't earn the success of her debut Finally, still it did serve to establish her as being more capable of straightforward R&B balladry. On this album she co-authored 3 of the album's fourteen tracks. Songs like ""I'm In The Mood,"" ""Anyway You Wanna Go,"" ""Hit By Love"" and ""I'm Not Over You"" are definitive examples of dance soul at its very best. This one's a must have for any lover of R&B, hip hop or dance music. Get this today if you don't already have it!"
5,The most essential CeCe,"One of the cutest, most likeable, and vocally talented dance divas ever, this second album from CeCe Peniston may not have spawned her biggest hit (Finally), but as a whole, it's definitely her most listenable album. Great throughout, best songs include ""I'm Not Over You"", ""Hit By Love"" (her most infectiously danceable thing after ""Finally""), ""Searchin"", ""I'm In The Mood"", and the downtempo, gospel-ish ""I Will Be Received"". An album definitely worth hearing many times."
4,great bracelet!,love this bracelet i wear it everyday its very sturdy and comfortable. i love the differnt color stones i also recieve alot of compliments[= very pleased..
4,I Beg to Differ,"The other reviewer (to date) warned us about the sound quality of this recording. He may well be right, though I come to a 1962 recording with very low expectations about sound. I would instead focus on the glorious singing of Regine Crespin, who I've said many times was among the most underrated singers of teh 20th century. Her voice here is warm, lush, rich, powerful and wicked seductive. She is also in better voice here than in the recording of her performances in London (also sold by Amazon). As far as I'm concerned, for anyone interested in this opera or in Mme. Crespin, this recording is very worthwhile."
5,Best Buy!,"Well this is my second CD burner and I have had it long enough to see all it features. It is a perfect buy for any one looking for a cheap, economical, and Fast CD writer.I have noticed that Sony CD-R have trouble being burned and it would cause the system to freeze but other then that this is a very good CD burner."
5,I feel the need... the need for speed!,"If you're lookin' for a fast CD burner, your prayers have been answered. This CD-RW drive satisfies the need for speed, economics, and features. It can burn in any format at blazing speed and comes with Nero Express, which is better than regular Nero. I was able to install it without it giving me any difficulty, and have yet to have any problems with it.Great CD burner."
3,...Um...It was different...,"I really can't describe ""Maze"" in mere words...it's very different. A lot of the plot and story truly makes no real coherent sense; however, if you want something to laugh with (or in my case, at), then ""Maze"" is certainly a winner. The basic premise of the story is a girl who wakes up in an alternate dimension, has total amnesia, special (phantom) powers, and turns into a guy at night. That's just the beginning, and I'm afraid it digresses from that into something totally weird. Small children, i.e. those under 35 years of age, probably should not watch Maze, and should instead be content with staring at their washing machine for hours upon end. It's not totally bad, but if you don't have a flair for something different, then I implore you NOT to buy Maze."
5,"""Dirt Boy""","Have you ever wondered how to convince some little boys that they need a bath? ""Dirt Boy"" is the answer. This is an excellent book to teach the concept of cleanliness. The use of sensory words makes the reader able to smell, see, and feel the impact of not bathing. As a classroom teacher, I see many ways to intergrate other subjects into a literature lesson. For example, a study of the senses, study of adjectives, and a math lesson on the number of cleaning products necessary to get Fister clean."
3,3 1//2* Stronger Than Dirt,"The delightfully gross tale of Finster Farnello-who revels in dirt-and his mother who calls him ""you smelly-stinky-mucky-gritty-grimy-grubby-little-dirt-boy."" (This book can be fun to read.)In a slightly disturbing twist, Finster runs away from home and meets Dirt Man, who hasn't taken a bath in 1,000 years. Finster copies the giant until his body grows weeds, moss, and slime. Unfortunately, his filth is appetizing to the Giant!There is a happy ending, as Finster discovers that while he ""still likes to get dirty... he also likes to get clean."" 30 pages, and vivid pictures constructed with such media as gouache, acrylic, crackle medium, modeling paste, sponges, fingers, old toothbrushes, and watercolor. The plot could have been more clever, but, judging by the other reviews here, kids just eat this one up!"
5,Slangerup is a Slanger-champ with Dirt Boy,"The Lengend of Dirt Boy is less a story and more a parable. Encouraging little boys to keep clean is as easy as pole vaulting to Neptune. Slangerup's tale of a boy who refuses to clean up (and the resulting consequences) is a welcome means to educate as well as entertain. I'm not sure if it's enough to keep kids clean, but it sure has me scrubbing behind the ears. The House of Harper eagerly awaits Slangerup's next offering."
4,Disappointed,"It was not Active Enough and did not work with a KVM switch. I can use it on other computers, just not my newest one."
5,A rare treasure wrapped in simplicity,"Ms Occhino, unlike bestselling novelists who would seem to follow the polls for every idea, is a person who has been there. She writes from the experience up, not from the fashion down. She is not ashamed to embrace simplicity if that is the path to a greater truth, and she 'gets it right' because she has learned the method of her spirits. It is refreshing to step aside from the wired, the sensational, the falsely complex, the misleading. This book is a blessing, and one can only thank Ms Occhino for having lived it.Hello from Heaven: A New Field of Research-After-Death Communication Confirms That Life and Love Are Eternal"
2,Nothing special,"I thought this book was going to get into more detail about how to enhance your psychic abilities and generally just talk about metaphysics or spirituality in some way. Instead, this is basically just a book of her telling stories of her life over and over again. Every once in a while she added something in the stories about how she followed the signs, etc. and talks about how we need to follow the signs in our own lives. After realizing that she just continually talks on and on about her life stories and doesn't really get into detail about anything regarding actual psychic ability (or anything else), I skimmed over the last few chapters and it was more of the same. This book was not worth reading."
5,I love this book!!!,"I've only discovered Mary in the last few months. I can't tell you how she has changed my morning comute to work, I love listening and learning from her. This is the first book I ordered by her and I just love it!! If you are a fan of Mary then you will LOVE this book! While I'm reading it I can actually hear Mary's voice and her phrasing. She makes me laugh and cry and also realize that we are in control of the energy around us. It is a very positive book with beautiful messages about life! I only have a few chapters left and I find myself savoring them, because I don't want this book to end!"
1,not worth the money,The vibration was too loud and the pillow was uncomfortable. I am going back to the inflatable pillow.
5,"Excellent product, good value",I have used Sandisk for years with no problems. I thought I would give Viking a try. Personally I can't tell the differance in download time and quality. Would not hesitate to purchase Viking again.
4,You really can't go wrong with Grant Green,"This is nice, but it's not where I would start out if I wanted an introduction to Grant Green. For that, I would get Idle Moments--a recording that shot into my top 10 the instant I heard it and is a must have for any decent jazz collection. The music here is solid and quite enjoyable, but overall doesn't stretch musically. There are, of course, some nice solos from Green. This CD is for those who really want to get to know Green's music on a broader level."
2,Buyer beware...,"Amazon advertized three used and one new Dyson... What would you think? I thought I was purchasing a ""new"" Dyson from Amazon as seller. When it arrived it was the reconditioned unit-- I am 63 years old-- (health not great) and old hands tore the box up getting it open-- don't have the resources to get another box and wrappings to return. Stuck-- hope it works and last a long time. Very disappointed in Amazon advertising. Buyer beware..."
5,Picks up pet hair with ease,"This factory reconditioned model was a bargain at this price. Debated whether it would be worth the cost over my relatively new bagless Bissel with HEPA filters. This unit picked up so much more dust, pet dander, and pet hair in the first two rooms, I certainly eased my mind about the price!There are only two settings for floors, carpet or bare floor. No height adjustment which was the only drawback as I have both plush and Berber carpets. Way too many attachments but it's always handy to have too much than too little. The wand is a bit awkward to use at first. When the unit is upright, the wand is activated and all suction flows through it rather than the floor piece, an interesting innovation that I've never seen before as most will continue to run both.Purchased the item on Friday morning, it arrived Monday with super saver shipping. Appeared to be brand new with no scratches or signs of use."
4,"So quiet and boy, does it suck!","I don't have much more to say abou thte Dyson than the other reviewers.It is exceptional at picking up dirt & such from the carpet. Perfect on wood floors. Almost too many attachments, I rarely use any. It's so quiet and the kids and dog don't run when I turn it on. :-)"
4,You won't be dissappointed ...,"The background. Okay, so we've all seen the commercial. Looks like a cool product - but does it work? My old vacuum was a Hoover Wind Tunnel, my carpet is cut pile (stuff is easily trapped), and I have a dog that loves to shed.The story. I friend made the leap, loved it, so I tried the DC14. It worked well and so I got the Complete here at amazon for $350. It works great. Although, refurbished it looks brand new, and came with a 6month warranty (not 90day as advertised). It picks up the dog hair like crazy. Suction is great... Oh yeah, it is also, very quiet compared to the older vacuum.Downside - would be hard to manuever for smaller, less strong people. (and the $350)Upside - suction, disposal of vacuumed material, all the tools, and how quiet it is.99% of reviews you are going to see are from people that like what they bought, otherwise they'd be admitting having made a mistake; however, I truly am glad I made this purchase and would recommend the DC14 to anyone!"
2,Dyson DC14 Complete,"I have to give Dyson DC14 a mixed review. It has very powerful motor and good dirt pickup. Unfortunately, it's extremely heavy, tough to push around and some of the attachments are difficult to attach and operate.I returned this product."
1,product does not match the picture,"The seller posted a picture of the tube, which shows clear amber latex tubing texture. But the tubes I received are very stiff, opaque rubber which has no resemblance to what was shown on the picture. The seller should be a little honest and describe the product properly!!!! The only good thing about the seller is that the products are well packaged and mailed promptly."
3,For the postgraduate,"I do agree with Nessander that it is pretty inaccessible for most laymen. However, I do like the concise but still fairly substantial papers in the rest of the companion, since I do know aspects of the field (cognitive science) well.The book will mostly serve academics, or students at the postgraduate level who require a thorough introduction to specialised areas of cognitive science, but do not have the time to follow up on the literature. I presume that people who read it would have already had at least an undergraduate background in one of the fields covered (AI, psychology, economics etc.)So while its audience base is limited, it still nonetheless serve a useful purpose to some readers like myself. It makes related topics accessible, without reducing it (the level of discussion that is) to the popular science level of discussion like articles in Scientific American etc. Also, it is not meant to be read from cover to cover."
3,"Overpriced, but works like new! UPDATE: BROKE at hinge. Where's the quality??","Replacement for ""worn-out"" original case for my razor. Works fine, just like original. Overpriced for a piece of molded plastic, but it's Braun!"
1,Disappointed,I was very excited when I purchased these shoes. Unfortunately it took 2 weeks for them to arrive and when I opened the package to inspect it the shoes looked dirty. They were supposed to be new. They were also mis-matched. They were supposed to be a size 8 1/2 M. They were one 8 1/2 M and one 8 1/2 N. I don't think I will buy anything from this seller again (Gotham City Online).
5,Worked Well,"I bought these jumper cables approximately a year ago, but I did not have a chance to use them until today. The cables were a good length, worked without any hitches, and fit back into the carrying bag afterwards. I strongly recommend these."
5,They're Jumper Cables Alright,"Not much to say about these. They're quality jumper cables, the length is convenient, they come in a nice little velcro bag, and they work gud. I accidentally ordered 2 but I'm glad I did. One for the trunk and one for the garage.Jumper cables - have them."
5,great stuff,The Tundra comic strip often exhbits the sheer brilliance one normally associates with Gary Larson. I can't beleive that none of the nationally circulated newspapers have picked up on this. I own a few of Chad Carpenter's books and they're all hilarious. I really suggest buying at least one of his books.
1,Get out of the Beltway,"This book purports to be a Dictionary of American political slang but should be entitled ""Washington D.C."" political slang. To test out the book, I looked up some commonly used Chicago political slang terms. None of them appeared in the book. Had the author bothered to look outside the Beltway, he could have found words like ""chinaman"" (a political sponsor/source of clout) and ""fetcher"" (a legislative bill proposed solely for the purpose of generating campaign contributions from an affected industry)."
3,Fiction mixed with reality.,"Then Major Peters produced an interesting work on the counterdrug effort, an effort that the US still remains commited to throughout Latin America. It is evident that when you sort through the fictional relationships established in the book, the complexity of providing these nations support from multiple levels of the US Gov. This is a task too large for any single agency or individual. What Mr Peters fails to paint is the total INABILITY of the US military ever taking an active part in any counterdrug effort, restrictions driven by US Law. The US Govt assists in many ways, but the problem remains that drugs have NOT been recognbized for the WMD they represent to America. In the end, US power and capabilities often appear handcuffed by a multiple groups of drug dealers made up of a mix of wise businessmen, political and military associates, and thugs, otherwise known as terrorist organizations."
3,"Not very user friendly, but works okay","Terrible user interface and non-standard UI design and navigation, and lacks useful reporting like ""how much money did I spend on..."", but it works pretty well otherwise."
1,Not a Cookbook,I bought this book as a present for my mom. I was under the assumption it was some form of cookbook. It was anything but. There is one recipe in this book. The rest of it is pictures of flowers and other decorations. My mom's spiral notebook serves the same function. Why was this listed as a cookbook?
1,not for professionals,"if one is contemplating investing in hedge funds personally,pursuing a career in hedge funds,starting a new job in an institution which invests in hedge funds, or just curious, then this book may be helpful. it is NOT going to be additive to most investment professionals, i.e. if you are already doing it, this book will seem very very basic. I bought it in the hopes of picking up new perspectives on structuring a hedged portfolio. in hindsight, I should have given the money to a qualified charitable organization..."
3,"Pretty Good, But Not Special","McKinty's third novel is the story of Alexander Lawson, an ex-police officer in Northern Ireland who quit the force under murky circumstances. When his ex-girlfriend is murdered in the States, he finds himself trying to find her murderer without the status of police officer or even licensed PI.The writing is fair, and McKinty makes us like Lawson in spite of Lawson's multitude of pretty serious errors in judgement that have nearly ruined his life. The problem with the plot is that it's quite simple to identify the perpetrator very early in the story. The motive is mundane and predictable, and the resolution is dilute and somewhat sterile."
3,Duh,"When a junkie is your protaganist, even the dullest reader figures it out before he does. That is the major drawback to this one. But enough talent makes me look for the next one."
5,Is that thing loaded???,"Sure, its one of The Great Man's best movies, but wher are the Paramount classics, Man On The Flying Trapeze and The Old Fashioned Way??These two Fields movies sum up his character better than any of 'em!"
4,fields at his best,"this is fields in top form! this is one of his best offerings of the movies he made. well written by fields,(under the name,mahatma kane jeeves)and performed as only he can do.this one is a must for any wc fields, or classic comedy fan"
3,a fine example of slapstick comedy,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.W.C. Fields stars as Egbert Sousè (Pronounced as ""Soosay"" but mispronounced as ""souse"" by many of the people in his town though he is also a souse) a husband who is constantly critized by his family for his drinking and smoking. He lated inadvertently catches a bank robber and is offered a job as a guard at the bank.The acting is what one would expect from comedy films of the time, and has a cameo role by Shemp Howard best known for his work as one of the 3 stooges.This is W.C. field's last major film role. The DVD has no special features."
3,"Dated, but amusing movie. Not one of his best.","Contrary to most reviews, this is not Fields' best movie. The pacing is slow, the humor often racist and offensive by modern standards. (Drunk-jokes wear thin after a while). If you are a film buff, you should own it. If you are not, you can do better. (""My Little Chick-a-Dee"" is funnier) END"
1,What Did I Miss,"I am wondering about myself. Everyone here loves this movie, but I found it incredibly tedious and unfunny (is that a word?)A lot of the ""humor"" is violent and abusive, the main character and his family are among the most hideously unsympathetic characters ever, and the ""one-liners"" are rare and not very clever. The so-called plot is feeble, dated and disjointed.After what seemed an endless period of time, I found that only 45 minutes had gone by.I love old movies, but I cannot understand why anyone would call this one of the funniest ever. Come on, this was released in 1940, after some of the truly great and funny movies of all time.I feel like the kid pointing out that the emporer has no clothes!"
5,NOW THAT'S MORE LIKE IT,"CLASSIC BLUE NOTE ALBUM FROM LEE MORGAN IN THE MID 1960'S. EARLIER I HAD REVIEWED ANOTHER LEE MORGAN FROM THE 1960'S ""DELIGHTFULEE MORGAN"", AND DID NOT GIVE IT A GREAT REVIEW. THIS ALBUM IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER, IT IS EVERYTHING THAT ALBUM IS NOT. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR LEE MORGAN RIGHT AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME, THEN BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WILL LOVE IT. GREAT JAZZ, WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A BLUE NOTE RECORD FROM THE 60'S. BTW, JOE HENDERSON IS AWESOME ON THIS RECORDING AS WELL, ESPECIALLY ON THE FIRST TRACK (YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF COLTRANE INFLUENCE IN HIS PLAYING)."
4,Bought for a gift.,I think the recipient will be pleased with his gift. I recieved notification that it shipped very quickly! I like the abilty to include a message for free.
4,"Acid Jazz? Starts here, folks!","The title tune puts the lie to all those jazz purists who say you got to listen and not dance. Here's Morgan with an incredible lineup, including Hank Mobley and Joe Henderson on tenor, and the marvelous Barry Harris on piano, playing music with a serious backbeat. This was a moment in time when really great players didn't feel they were prostituting themselves by playing music that appealed to popular tastes. They were on the money then (to coin a phrase) and they're on the money now, because many Acid Jazz cats are coining it bigtime off this music. Forget art, let's dance!"
4,Playful,"This is a fairly happy date - not a lot of ""blue notes"" for a classic Blue Note release. But that's cool. It's nice to hear Lee Morgan sound so playful, kinda like Brownie. And especially interesting to hear a young Joe Henderson in this context. IMHO, if the rhythm section played just a little less generically, this would be a 5 star session. This RVG edition has excellent sound."
1,its a mess and noise,"I'm a fun of jazz and I have decent equipment to play it on but I've never waded through this CD to the end. I just couldn't stand the quality of sound. Cymbals are terrible (bleeding ears)and instruments are imbalanced. Please compare some older Davis recordings from Columbia or Bill Evans from Riverside where percussion is much more subtle and refined. I asked my friend, audiophile for judgement. He said ""its a mess and noise"". Despite significant upgrades and refinements in my stereo the CD didn't survive in my collectom. I'd say the same about some other RvG Editins (e.g. Cool Struttin' or Blowin' Session). The music itself is not bad, quite energetic but it can't make you tired. Fatigue factor is very, very high in this case."
5,Vimes is simply wonderful..,"..and his performance in this book is no exception. He's been sent to Uberwald as a diplomat, a role he really does not want to play. However, when the dwarfish Scone of Stone is stolen, he gets to play a role he likes so much more- pulp-detective-fiction star. Not that this one's always pleasant- before the book's half over he's been arrested for touching the dwarfs' Low King and is being hunted down by werewolves. Meanwhile, back in Ankh-Morpork, Angua's gone missing, Carrot resigns to go look for her, and Sergeant Colon becomes Acting Captain Colon, a job he totally and utterly botches. How did the Scone get taken? By who? And why is it so important that that clerk didn't catch an orange?"
5,Hilarious!,Quick Synopsis - Vimes is sent as an ambassidor to foreign lands where he runs into vampires and werewolves that don't have his best interest at heart.A great book. I personally found it up there with the best of the series. It has great pacing and fills up the pages with plenty of action.If you are a fan of the series you can't miss this one.
3,Not all that,"I love Discworld, and 5th Elephant was entertaining, but it doesn't stand out as one of his better books. The giggles are few and far between, and you get the feeling the book carried on for a good fifty pages after what seemed like the true ending."
4,"Really, really good","I am a Terry Pratchett fan, not completely indiscriminate, but I have liked everything of his that I have read (about 20 or so books so far). Having said that, I do not consider ""The Fifth Elephant"" to be the best Discworld novel but it is really, really good. Funny, inventive and for all the trappings of fantasy (vampires, werewolves, trolls) filled with characters real enough to care about. I strongly recommend this novel to fantasy fans, comic novel fans, and generally anyone who enjoys well written and well plotted fiction."
4,"Another triumph, but not quite perfection","Well, things are starting to get a little weird on the Disc. Ankh-Morpork has started a communications revolution (wonder if Pterry read ""The Victorian Internet"" for the details on telegraph towers?), and Vetinari has started to manipulate other nations politically. Alas, quite a few parties don't want that to happen. This one's a strange amalgam of social commentary and Die Hard-type movie, with Vimes and Carrot in hot pursuit of various interested parties, being hurt quite badly, and NEVER GIVING UP. For long-time Discworld fans: Death makes a cameo appearance, and Gaspode returns. Nobbs seems to be almost human, and Colon goes completely mental. I'd say this is well worth the hardback purchase. Read and enjoy. My favorite gag: Dorfl the golem's protest sign when he's on strike. Don't worry; that'll make sense in context."
4,A Darker Pratchett,"The Fifth Elephant is a continuation of Pratchett's attempts to become more 'mature' in his storytelling. As the author said, he can't continue writing about incompetent wizards forever (although many of his fans would disagree).This novel set in the City Watch parodies equal opportunities and considers stereotypes. Unlike what others may say, part of Pratchett's success is his continual quality, although with this novel Pratchett writes in a slightly darker, grittier mode than before in his depictions of life in his fantasy New York.I met Pratchett once, and he is very gracious to his fans."
5,The Best Disc World Yet,I am reading the DiscWorld books completely out of order. So far this is my favorite of all. The story is more than just witty satire and quick quips. There is social and political commentary and a great sub plot concerning Angua and Carrot. Carrot's character does quite a lot of growing in this book even though you don't see it until the very end.
3,Affectionate Warning,"I love Terry Pratchett novels and even more than that, I love having the chance to listen to them. This cassette edition is narrated by Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in the Black Adder series; he does a lovely job and the novel is, of course, funny and original. However, I must warn you, it is abridged and that does detract from the delight of it. Anyone considering purchasing this might want to instead consider the audio versions of The Wee Free Men or The Night Watch, also available on this website for reasonable prices."
2,The beginning of the end,"Is it just me who thinks that the Discworld has lost its life? I always loved Discworld- I read and re-read every book up to Fifth Elephant with gusto, and I loved them like no other books in the world. But when I read Fifth Elephant, I found something had changed. There is just no life to this book. It wasn't remotely funny, the plot was confusing and unexciting... I don't know why, but I just didn't enjoy reading this one. I got bored with it after the first few pages, and it was a chore to read the rest. It was awful for me; like having a good friend suddenly turn on me. Every book following Fifth Elephant has, in my opinion, only gone downhill. It's not that Pratchett has run out of ideas, but that he seems to have lost his enthusiasm. It's horribly depressing."
4,Really Enjoyed My Introduction to Discworld,"This is the first book I've read by Terry Pratchett--I know...Where have I been!--and I must say it was thoroughly enjoyable, and I certainly will not wait as long to pick up the next one. Though it sounds like most of you are quite familiar with his work, I found the blend of humor, mystery, fantasy and parody quite refreshing after all the traditional sword and sorcery fare, and look forward now to being able to go back to the beginning with ""The Colour of Magic."" I must say, though, that all the ""stars"" contained herein seem evidence of the usual ratings inflation: As much as I enjoyed this work, it seems to me to lack the depth or breadth of a classic."
4,Pratchett simply rules,"And that's enough to get this book four stars straight off. As a longtime Pratchett fan though, I couldn't give it the extra star because it just can't compare with some of his earlier novels. If you're new to Pratchett, it's probably best to begin with the first Discworld novels ('The Colour of Magic' and 'The Light Fantastic') which are both incredible, or the first book involving the Ankh-Morpork Watch, 'Guards! Guards!', also one of his best in my opinion.Fellow T.P veterans: not as good as 'Feet of Clay', but better than 'Jingo'. As much as I love the watch, it might be good if they were given a rest for a bit. Just how far can Vimes possibly get promoted?Pratchett rocks. 'The Fifth Elephant' is thoroughly enjoyable, as always. Read it!"
2,"A little too 'Hitch-hiker's"" for me","It's not a bad book, it's just...weird. It's so tongue-in-cheek that I spent the first 2/3 of the book trying to dig past that part to get to the actual story. Once you get the story figured out and get a sense of at least a couple of the main characters (there were tier-2 characters who I still had no clue who they were at the end of the book), it's ok. But it's just way too 'out there' for me. My first and probably last experience with this author. If you like stuff like the Hitchhiker's Guide then you'll probably like this, but it's just not my thing."
5,awesome,I got my iteam by the time it was said to arive and in great condtion. I am very happy with this product. good book
5,Yet Another Excellent Book of the Watch,"This is the 24th of Pratchett's Discworld series. Alternatively, it's the 5th book in the Watch subseries (""Guards! Guards,"" ""Men at Arms,"" ""Feet of Clay,"" ""Jingo,"" ""The Fifth Elephant,"" ""Night Watch,"" and ""Thud!""). In this one, Pratchett uproots the Watch and has it visit Uberwald. While there, Mr. Vimes meets and old friend of the Patrician and the family of Angua. Like most of the other Watch books, this one's far more ""serious"" and deeper than standard Discword fare. It reads more like a romantic adventure mystery than a comedy and has a very emotionally satisfying ending. An excellent book: 5 stars out of 5."
5,"Funny, as usual","Terry Pratchett has done it again - as expected. His tour-de-force performances with practically every volume of his Discworld series has become the defacto standard that he has set for himself.Once again, Sam Vines, Commander of the City Watch of the magnificently squalid city of Ankh-Morpork, finds himself in an awkwardly uncomfortable situation. Once again, Sam Vines, Commander of the City Watch of Lord Vetinari's personal chessboard, manages to overcome all odds and finesse his way out of a mess. In the course of all this, there is the whole gamut of humor, ranging from amused smiles, past sudden, surprised guffaws, to helpless outbursts of uncontrolled laughter. Mr. Pratchett has managed to do it again.What can I say? Nobody does the satirical fantasy humor genre nearly as well as Terry Pratchett. May the gods (and goddesses) that inhabit Dunmanifestin save us if anyone ever does: we'd probably all expire from an overdose of laughter!"
4,Great Book,"I'm slowly filling in the gaps in my knowledge of Discworld lore, starting with this book. Vimes and the Watchmen are some of my favorite characters from any story and it's a treat to read about them out of Ankh and out of their element."
5,"I can't think of a good title,so I just put this down.","This was one of the best books I have ever read!!! I've always been a fantasy person, so this book was perfect for me."
4,"Good, but not enough practice...","This book has the basic review for the SSHSAT test for the specialized high schools. However, unlike the Barrons book, it does not have enough practice examples. This book, to me, can only be used to resharpen your formulas and ideas, not to actually practice. The questions are way to easy, even a fifth grader can do it! You should buy this book in supplement to the Barrons book to review what you do not remember. I rate this book OK.The good news is that I got into Brooklyn Tech with the two books. If you study over the summer, like I did, I think you would have a really good chance in getting in. Good Luck to all who wants to take the test. :)"
5,A solid PDU at a decent price,"This basic PDU feels solid. All the plugs feel ""tight"", no wiggly connections. No-frills: there's a circuit-breaker, and a long cord. No surge suppression or other features.The outlets are packed tight; 12 in the space of 10 on theAPC AP9562, so large plugs may overhang the adjacent outlet. A 13th outlet is on the flip side, but isn't very useful for my configuration where it faces into the back of the rack.The rack ears come pre-attached, but can be removed/reversed for inside/outside mounts. It would be nice if it included rack-mount screws and ""cage nuts"" for square-hole racks, since this sort of PDU is really only going to see use in racks.If you have the right kind of rack, one of APC's ""0U"" vertical PDUs might be a better choice, but for a generic rack this is a good choice that occupies minimal space and looks/feels professional.Recommended, a good price per-outlet for an industrial grade PDU."
4,Bill Medley,My Husband is a big Bill Medley fan and ordered this for his birthday. He Has played this many times.
5,GREAT SHOE EVEN BETTER FIT!,"Needless to say I am one of the biggest fanatics of the Nine West brand. My closet is filled with Nine West shoes that I purchased years ago, some worn out and some that have never been worn. I was spectacle about ordering these shoes because my biggest fear was that with the height of the heel that they would run small and not fit my size 11 foot. These shoes are the best! They are comfortable and they TURN HEADS! They run a little big (but not much) I HIGHLY recommend these shoes. If you're looking and you're unsure about them, STOP! Take out your credit card and rush to checkout. You can wear them with a summer dress, cute skirt or skinny jeans. I LOVE THESE SHOES!!!! A+++++"
3,Homegrown Hippie,"I meant to review Traveling Chamber Blues show, which looks similar to this one, so the opinions expressed may not reflect this particular album, but I have a feeling this one sounds pretty much like the other one.You gotta really love the harmonica to be happy with this CD. I've tried it twice now, but can't get through it. It's not bad, I just can't get through the harmonica and violin to get to the groove. I'd heard a couple of songs from him before buying this that had a quirky, groovy feel to them, that I thought would take me to the acoustic crossover between buzzland and hometown organic. A rare place to go I can tell you, but neccessary once in a while. Anyway, I'm going to keep looking for the right time to try it again so I can hopefully appreciate it. But until I can find it, my advice is to buy it only if you love the sound of a harmonica."
3,Good Enough,"I purchased this cooling rack and was somewhat disappointed with it's performance. The legs that make the racks stackable bend easily and so the tiers are no longer level and cookies slide around on them. Also, you need to let your cookies cool on the cookie sheets before transferring them to this rack because the distance between the bars is so wide that cookies don't get enough support and will break and fall through if they are too warm. Nevertheless, they still work and are great when counter space is at a premium, just make sure you let your baked goods cool before using this cooling rack.I much prefer Wilton's cooling grids to these racks even though I can't stack them."
4,GOOD BASIC COOLING RACKS,"These are three tier stackable cookie & pie racks. I have some of these from years ago but needed a couple more. They are good racks not as sturdy or large as my old ones are but so far they work pretty well. Space saving, reasonably priced the legs fold under and can be stored in a drawer or cabinet."
2,Planetary introduction to Astronomy.,"Although this book is easy to understand, its lack of color pictures and dry writing style makes it rather dull reading. There are better books on the market."
2,ok,This product came as it was promised...I would definitely buy from this company again in the future. Glad it's available online it just didn't work for me.
1,Book written full of wrong data,"First of all Lukavica isnt in the center of Sarajevo as this book says. Secondly, the procenteges used to describe population are reverted and incorrect.Very purly and badly written book. It will just confuse you.I was born in Sarajevo, and lived there until 1995 so i was 'living' situation this book tries to portrait and fails at evry aspect of it."
3,I can't believe it's not Mogwai,"Because if this was a blank CD, it sounds nearly identical--except for maybe the first five songs that blend Mogwai with the time signatures of Fugazi. Produced by (uncredited although his studio's named) Steve Albini, this NZ trio pounds out ""angular post-rock"" as the sticker on my copy promised. Being practically indistiguishable from their Scottish and D.C. influences, this may or may not then be a recommendation to you to seek this out. I leave it up to you. Confusingly or obviously, this band was also known as ""High Dependency Unit""--the letters only are on the CD spine, while the band's full name appears on the cover."
3,Slide rattling good,"This is Dave Hole's first album which came to light because he sent the album to US Guitar Player magazine and blew the reviewer away. Ten years on I find many tracks which are still great and many tracks now less than memorable. Dave's slide is still the highlight with none better than the title track 'Short fuse Blues'. Other feature tracks are 'Purple Haze', 'Albatross', 'Travelling riverside blues' and 'the sun is shining'. However, there are too many songs on which Dave's energy exceeds his talent. High energy blues/rock which is still worth a place in my collection."
5,who?,"this the american debut of an amazing artist. since, he has released more great discs. i saw him live in KC. he whipped the crowd into a frenzy and left them panting for more!"
3,A little disappointed with the durability,My 4 year old loves to role play and particularly crawls through tents at every store we find them. So this seemed perfect for him when I saw it online. I gave it to him for Christmas 2009 and have been surprised that he really doesn't play in it much.It was a little challenging to build (but I guess not unexpectedly so)and did fall in on the boys a couple of times they played in it (but they play pretty rough!).I will say it is really cute and big.
1,Not reliable,"I have owned this product for about 2 years now. Over the past two years, we have had frequent disconnections, dropped packets, slow traffic, etc. For a while I thought it was our router or DSL modem, so I kept switching them out, but finally I bypassed this switch and everything has been great since.When the packets start dropping, you can't even access the switch's web UI, and it responds to ping's erratically. I've used both D-Link and Linksys routers, it doesn't work reliably with either.I would never buy another of these switches again."
5,A must read for those interested in Che,Filled with excerpts from Che's own Congo diary and replete with insights into the failures of the Cuban backed People's Liberation Army. A haunting look at some of the same failures that would befall Che and lead to his capture and execution in Bolivia. A great read!
2,"silly and rediculous... and not in a fun way, either","An old friend of Carter's asks him to look into a shady cult that her brother has just joined. Within days, the brother is dead and the sister is kidnapped, sending Carter into the Amazon to rescue her before the cult becomes the next Jonestown.This was my first exposure to the Nick Carter saga, so I can't say how this stacks up against the others. As a stand-alone episode, it's an inch short of absurd. I realize this is the type of book you're supposed to turn off your brain with and just enjoy the ride, but it was too poorly written and ridiculous for me to do so.It probably goes without saying that the ""plot"" is filler to pad between car chases, gun fights, and tawdry sex scenes. Admittedly, the story moves along at a brisk clip, mostly because the author has jettisoned such cumbersome cargo as descriptive detail, character development, words over three syllables, and caulking to plug all those pesky plot holes."
5,An excellent and challenging workbook!,"This workbook is a great companion to any learning theories class - it's challenging enough to stimulate creative thinking in dealing with the issues and concepts in general learning theories, but isn't so difficult that working through the material isn't fun! Also, the extensive use of hypothetical scenarios and circumstances is extremely conducive to applying key concepts to real life."
2,Poor version of Dr. Sarno's,"If you would like to discover or further expand your knowledge of TMS then read Dr.Sarno's or Dr. Schubiner's books. Not this book. This book is like an overly simple version of those. This book should be called ""an addition"" to Dr. Sarno's books. Personally, if this were the first TMS book I had read I would have not taken the TMS concept seriously at all.BUT, my biggest problem with this book is the random suicide story. How was that necessary? That was a giant pointless chunk of negativity."
1,Vile Smell - Very Little Pumic,"I just bought this today b/c I was out of a pumic foot scrub I love that I bought abroad and figured ""how much can can this kind of thing differ?""A lot. OMG - the smell is vile - when was the last time anyone served you Plum/Peppermint tea? Never! For a reason!But more importantly, there was very little grit in this ""pumic"" scrub - nothing abrasive enough to scrape off anything. Total waste of money. Will return if I have the time, though unlikely."
2,Shakers Lost Me,"Friends who are teachers recommended Downing's book as an entertaining picture of campus politics. That part was entertaining, as was the punctuation and grammar lesson at the end of each chapter. The whole story of Celia and the Shakers was needlessly confusing and not very interesting. And what's with this affectation of not using paragraph breaks? The author didn't present that grammar lesson but needed to."
4,Good But...,"PERFECT AGREEMENT is an interesting mixture of stories, parables, and wonderful observations by a professor of English in a small Eastern college. It involves a lengthy Quaker connection, college faculty infighting and a sweet love story between two intelligent men. The author includes great grammar lessons at the end of each chapter. Thanks Michael Downing, I needed (and enjoyed) that. Though the language is incredible, the humor subtle, and the grammar lessons interesting and useful, the format makes for difficult reading. There are no paragraph breaks. The long stretches of print made me wish the author would stop to take a breath. H"
4,Great PWC product,Works great. Keeps the rope from under the PWC. You need to secure both sides. Be sure to NOT use the velcro tab to hold it on. Very versatile and will buy another upon my next PWC purchase.
1,This book did nothing for me,"Although it tries to help, I am still addicted to pornography. I seem to be using it more now than ever before."
4,A Traditional Album,"Niña Pastori issued this album in 2000. Since then, she has moved further toward the pop side of popular flamenco and has twice received the Latin Grammy. If your preference is traditional flamenco, as I, then this transitional album may be of interest. Indeed, she opens with a traditionally arranged bulería, and the album also includes tangos, rumba, and allegrías. She has the typical rough or ""strained"" voice of flamenco cantaors. She and her fellow artists of this vibrant contemporary style, such as Diego el Cigala, have expanded the world audience of flamenco. As with jazz vocalists, success is attained with believability, a sensitivity to the lyrics. Pastori has been honored because she has this ability to convey the lyrics beyond the ear to the heart. The insert contains the lyrics in Spanish. The album is short, which is not unusual for flamenco musicians, lasting some 38 minutes."
5,Too Much Fun,"This is just as the title says! It has slow music. It has upbeat music. It makes you happy and puts you in a good mood! The accordian is the ""KEY""! If you close your eyes, you think that you're in New Orleans."
2,Didn't Get Me,I had no nack for this album. Drum Thunder is not great. The only good tracks are Monin' and Blues March. I'll listen to it closly again though.
5,Remastered! A great jazz album.,"To be a fly on the wall of the Van Gelder Studio on October 30, 1958 would have been a chance to witness the recording of one of the great hard bop albums of the era. Art Blakey and his messengers produced something special here: the title track written by pianist Bobby Timmons simply grooves. The rest of the songs (save for Come Rain or Shine) are written by the talented tenor sax player Benny Golson. The best among these is Blues March which fuses New Orleans marching band styles with blues improvisations and bop. It isn't a straight boring tune, either: it moves unpredictably. Included specially on this remastered version are an alternate take of Moanin' and a warm-up and banter track. These are just gravy compared to the excellent sound of the album itself. Certainly an essential Blakey CD."
3,Great Music - Poor Vinyl Pressing,"The Vinyl + CD may at first appear to be a rather good deal, but unfortunately, after purchasing both ""Maiden Voyage"" by Herbie Hancock and Art Blakey's ""Moanin,"" (both in this format) I have found the vinyl quality for both rather unsatisfactory. Blue Note Records is a subsidiary of Capitol Records, and I have encountered similar problems with Capitol's other new releases of older albums. The new albums come with small scratches on them, smears, and there is generally too much popping noise while listening to these newer pressings. Additionally, I have had similar experiences with some of Columbia's newer pressings like Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" and even a few Impulse records, although not quite as many bad records as Capitol's vinyls. I would therefore recommend buying just the CD, and look for older pressings of these fine albums either from the Amazon market place, Discogs, or retail record stores that specialize in used records."
5,"Wow, what a remaster","The quality of this remaster is outstanding. I have fallen in love with all of the Rudy Van Gelder remasters on Blue Note. This CD is the definitive Art Blakey. Every track makes you tap your foot and smile. If you get any Art Blakey, get this. And second buy his Live at Birdland, you won't regret it. This CD is truly one of Jazz greats and should not be forgotten. This is a great place to start in 50's and 60's accoustic jazz too, so if you are new to the genere this is a great purchase."
3,A bit clunky - very long,"This is a kind of wacky necklace - a bit fun, a bit like a little girl wearing mom's jewelry. I think it is as pictured - very yellow/orange. But, I was not prepared for the length, which I found more than a bit awkward. The wrapped portion fell just below the bra line, so that the necklace end hung, in a particularly awkward location (on me). Had it been a tad longer or a tad shorter (which was what it looks like in the picture) it would be fine. I do not think the clasp quality is very good, but for the price, I cannot complain. This necklace is kind of reminiscent of the 20s with its length, and I definitely think it could be dressed up or down - but probably won't look right with a t-shirt."
5,Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America,This is a must book if you are building a Birch Bark Canoe. It is the holy graille or encyclopaedia for building canoe's. Fantastic book.
4,Harmonica Blues Highlight,"This is the late William Clarke's first and best album. Clarke's harp is certainly the strength of the songs with styles varying from blues, swing, rock and sometimes touching on jazz. His vocals are also a feature as is the guitar of Alex Schultz and the drums of Lee Campbell. My favourites are the slows mood blues of 'Going down this highway' and 'Its been a long time' which highlight how good a harp man he was. The track 'Pawnshop bound' also features superb up tempo harmonica."
3,'a most peculiar novel' (Hermione Lee),"This novel certainly does have a most bizarre theme; when the ruined estate of Brokeyates is inherited by Nicholas, a young Australian glad to leave his homeland for a new start, we sense from the start that there is more to his background than we are told. He marries Alethea and they have a daughter. But with the birth of their son, a dwarf, the family seems to be disintegrating...There is some lovely writing here, beautiful descriptions of the countryside. It kept me reading to the end but it lacks the genius of Olivier's better known 'The Love Child'."
4,Her Best Cut to Me,though Brandy has had quite a few Hits this is the Song that I like Porbably the best of Her's.together with Babyface who Wrote&Produced this Track Brandy knock this Song out.cool Groove& I dig Her vocals on it.
2,Abridged Version,"This is an abridged version. If you want an unabridged version, get the Life of Johnson (Oxford World's Classics) [UNABRIDGED."
4,CANT WAIT FOR MORE,I dont understand what people are talking about. Lisa Rinna's Dance Body Beautiful DVD's are some of my favorite. She is adorable in teaching it and the moves and dances are great. Really gets you moving and working up a sweat. Cant wait for more of her Dvd'S to come out!!!!!!! I will buy them all. IT's A GREAT WORKOUT!
3,"Ok, but not great","I just tried this video, & as a beginner I found it very hard to follow. The only workout that I could attempt with any confidence was the first one (the Super Rumba). The remaining 3 dance steps were broke down very poorly (she shows you the steps way too quickly & with unhelpful screen shots -- if you're going to show us dance steps, show us your feet the whole time, & from angles that actually show us how to do the steps!). And then the ""slow"" versions of last 3 dance steps are way too fast for someone who is just starting out. The bonus abs workout was ok & I'll probably start doing that more often.I'll keep trying it, but I wish the creators of this workout would have chosen less complicated steps, or at least broke down these steps in a more user-friendly way."
2,Coulda been great,"The other reviews convinced me to give this a try. Although I really enjoy Lisa's attitude and confidence, there are several drawbacks to the workout.1) The cueing is spotty. Because the routines are complex and fast, this is an important omission.2) When she says ""turn left"" - to the audience, she actually means, "" turn right."" I was always in the reverse image. EVERY other exercise video I've tried accounts for this.3) There isn't enough awareness about safety when stretching or moving fast.With some coaching Lisa could be a terrific instructor. She has the body, motivation, and good energy to inspire. The routines were close, too, and fun, but I couldn't overcome the drawbacks. The ability to move well and have great rhythm is a huge plus, but she needs to study with instructors who've made successful videos. Till then, I humbly suggest that she not quit her day job;)"
2,Will NOT work with Vista,"I wouldn't know anything about the performance of this mouse because I never got it to work. The driver had an update for Vista but even with help from a computer pro, there was no way to get it working. Cute though."
2,Battery life,It sucks battery like a starving baby!!!Don't forget to buy rechargeable batteries.I'm using NiMH and I'm not able to work one week without recharge it.
2,Worked well for a while but unreliable,I bought this when It had just come out in the market for $80.00 It really worked well for while but has now appears to have died after just a few months (< 1 yr) of use. I think that weakest part is the slide on/off switch which is useful for saving battery power but whose malfunction has likely killed the mouse. Not a good value for the money.
4,Good mouse but poor battery life,"I like the mouse but had to change the batteries every other week so far... seems like a lot to me. I use it as my main mouse at work , and I turn it off during the weekend.Beside that it works seamlessly and is also good to connect other bluethooth devices to my laptop."
3,Arms with no politics...,"This DVD is fine but not all that... you can not take it as a documentary about political, strategical or historical events. Instead you take it as power show-off.If you are after arms, planes, fighters and strategic weapons used in the war... this DVD covers most of it.But if you want fully covered details about behind the scenes policies and in depth covered histroy, this DVD is not all that."
4,Different coverage,Not the ususal footage on the Gulf War. Well done and presented. Relevant to anyone interested in this subject. Good footage and interviews.
4,"Recapture of Kuwait is simple apperanced Battle--- In Behind , many complicated Political Backgroud of US, Iraqu and Kuwait !","Already restricted War between Iraq vs Kuwait, US vs Iraq had thepossibility of Battle between US and Iraq.Formerly,Iran and US Supported Iraq had the battle.Iraq became enemy in later with complicated political background.this tlme,""Gulf War""started from overruned Kuwait with Tank and mechanizedIraq Army ,US Attacked Iraq soldiers with overwhluming Air Strikes, M1A1Abraham Tanks and many Tomahawk Missles and it brought immediate disintegrstions of All miltatary Actions. this limited ""GULF War""immediate recapture of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraq Saddam Husseinand immediately War stopped withought solying political problems.It later become another Entire Battle of Iraq. !"
2,Nothing really interesting here,"Just a standard patriotic show about a superpower's weapons destroying a 3rd rate enemy which had already previously lost most of its military capability anyway after the 9 year war with Iran. There are plenty of documentaries like this on the History Channel, its hardly worth putting in your DVD collection."
1,It did not work for me.,"This item did not do anything for me. This is not a review of the brand-name, but of the supplement itself."
5,GREAT PRODUCT PERIOD!!!!!!,"This a great product for anyone that needs a stopwatch. The pictures fooled me a little bit because the stopwatch looks big in the pictures i thought, but its actually pretty small. I purchased this watch for track and field during the off-season and i have been fooling around with it a little. It has an average amount of features including all that you need in a stopwatch plus more but is not as fancy as the expensive ones obviously. This stopwatch times down to the .001 so it is very accurate. Robic is also the best company for stopwatches if your are looking for accuracy and demandable. It is used by many track coaches and is used for timing at many track meets. Great product and i recomend it if you are worried about the quality."
4,Great B horror movie,"If you like the great old B horror movies, you will like this movie. This is one that I hadn't seen before."
1,stay away,"It was supposed to bright more than the regular ones. Well, the regulars give more light than this one. I just threw away my money. I recommend not to buy this product. It's the worst I've been with"
1,not as advertised...,"Picture is a clear bulb, says it is Super White...what came in the mail was a Hyper White bulb that was actually a blue-glass bulb..."
4,How global is advertising?,"A very interesting book, written by many authors that have lots of experience in different fields/countries. It all comes down to the questions ""how global or local shall we advertise?"", ""what are the success factors for global advertising?"" and ""how global are our consumers?"". There is no black and white, but the book gives tons of examples, hints and suggestions about the different levels of grey, how they can lead to success or failure. Overall I can recommend the book, although it will not give you the simple answer you are looking for, simply because there is no simple answer."
4,Great workbook!,"Found charts, examples, and exercises extremely useful.One improvement I would like to see is either a CD or downloadable audio to go along with the book -- maybe video as well to show the diagrams in motion."
3,Half the book,"Shipping and everything was great, but I only got half the book- chapters 25 and on, it didn't even have a title page. I don't know what it was with this one, but I did expect the whole book..."
3,Nice wire but not UL listed,"Well, this probably won't be an issue for most people but I ran into a problem with the wire. I was using it for a home theater installation in a new addition to the house. The cable was run through the walls. When the electrical inspector came out to check everything he said it wasn't UL listed and made me pull it all out and replace it. :( Lucky for me he didn't have any issues with the other cables (e.g. HDMI).As far as the wire quality is concerned, it's really nice. I'll have to figure out how I'm going to use 250' of it now though.One final note, the wire is a bit challenging to strip. It takes a lot of care to cut through the outer sheath without damaging the inner wires."
5,The Write Match is the right stuff!,"This is a wonderful book! I had been looking for a book that would grab my attention right out of the gate and this was it. I am tired of trying to get into a book for so long that I am half way through it before I decide to continue or put it down... I wanted a book that would engage me from the first paragraph and this was it. The characters were believeable, and the premise of the story itself was such a breath of fresh air. I can't wait to see who plays the leading roles when the movie comes out! I am keeping an eye on this author; this is my kind of novel. What a feel-good read!"
3,"Good read, ending a bit disappointing.","People are mysteriously disappearing in the small town of Rapture, Indiana. Rumour has it that it is an act of God, sending the faithful to heaven and leaving the sinners back on Earth, or maybe it's alien abductions? Whatever it is, Owen Keane is on the case to find out what is causing the disappearances and what it has to do with a man he helped convict years before.This is my first Owen Keane novel, but I found I didn't need to have read the 5 previous Keane novels to know and understand the character. It's very well written and has great elements of mystery. Characterisation was great, and greatly enhanced the misleading factor of the guilty parties for this mystery. The only disappointing aspect was the ending, which seemed a bit too contrived and 'Hardy Boyish' for my liking.Overall, it was a very satisfying read. RECOMMENDED!!!"

2,GREAT AMERICAN BASH is a smackdown ppv-CRAP!!!!!!!!!!,"I do like the idea of new ppv's but why didn't they give it to the best brand which is Raw.Only 1 match has been named for this ppv and it could be a good match but only if it is a different type of match. The wwe ppv's are getting better but what happened to table, cage, tlc,elimination matches, ironman and hell in a cells.They were the most entertaining matches but every match now is 1 vs 1 normal matches.The wwe could make ppv's alot better if they add different kinds of matches. The wrestling is alot faster and longer now than it used to be though.JBL vs Eddie Guerrero-This rivalry is heating up and this should be a good match. JBL is better than Bradshaw because now he can concentrate on using his talent in single matches. If JBL chooses a good match type it will save this match."
1,BOOOOOOOOO!!!!,"Hi its me the guy who reviews all the way to 2008.This review is about the 2005 Great American BashM1 Chavo Guerrero vs. Jaime Noble Cruiserweight TitleWinner=Jaime NobleM2 JBL vs. FaarooqWinner=JBLM3 John Cena vs. Rob Van Dam U.S. TitleWinner=Rob Van Dam (DQ)M4 Rey Mysterio & Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Dudley BoyzWinners=Dudley BoyzM5 Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show Cage MatchWinner=Brock LesnarM6 Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak vs. Undertaker, John Cena & Rob Van Dam WWE TitleWinners=Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak"
1,The not so great american bash,What a rubbish PPV Vince this is not acceptable and raw have got more main event superstars than Smackdown have Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle.JBL WON THE title if their going to let the title change hands then they should not get the GM TO CUM OUT AND SAY THE REFERE WAS WRONG.I watched the event in England were i stayed up till 4am to watch this i would have had more fun watching the rain fall from the clouds how i didnt fall asleep i dont know!
3,It was Alright,"This PPV wasnt that bad and wasnt that good either and it will prolly be one of worst ppvs of 2004 list, well here are the matches I rate out of 41)Cena vs Booker vs RVD vs Rene Dupre U.S Titlegreat opener and great performance by all ***2)Luther Reigns vs Charliewhy Kurt add this match on a PPV, *3)Rey vs Chavo Cruiserweight Titleprolly the best Cruiserweight match of the year ***4)Billy Gunn vs Kenzo Suskiawful another bad match *5)Torrie vs Sablestill awful and slow and sloppy *6)Hardcore Holly vs Mordeachiwell a couple of punches but still awful *1/27)JBL vs Eddie Texas BullRope Match WWE Championshipfinally a good match, better than Jugment Day match ***8)Undertaker vs Dudleyz Concret Crypt matchwhy this main event, it wasnt that long even but still pretty good **1/2Overall: Nothing more than a decent rental"
3,It was Alright,This Smackdown PPV was alright 4 out of 8 matches was good.1)John Cene vs RVD vs Booker T vs Rene Dupre U.S Titlea really great opener with great moves by all 9/102)Charlie Haas vs Luther Reignsuh what the hell is this what is Kurt thinking adding this match a PPV. crap 4/103)Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerro Cruiserweight Titlehigh flying action and a great match 8.5/104)Billy Gunn vs Kenzo Suskiboring and boring 3/105)Torrie vs Sableonly good part is there outfits 5/106) Mordeicha vs Hardcore Hollystill boring but some good hits 5/107)JBL vs Eddie Gueero WWE Title Bull Rope Matchbest match of the night and obvious the first time u watch this that Paul Bearer will be buried alive because that was the main event but this was GREAT MATCH 9.5/108)Undertaker vs Dudleyz Concrete Crypt matchpretty good match but shoudnt been main event and so long Paul Bearer 8/10
1,Worst. PPV. Ever.,"At this point i have completely given up on WWE SmackDown! This was simply one of the worst PPVs from the WWE i have ever seen, I have not seen one as terrible as this since the mid 90's. This entire PPV was a joke with the main event as The Undertaker vs. the Dudley Boyz? dont forget JBL winning the the title from Eddie Guerrero. I hope this PPV gets a 0.0 buyrate maybe it will be a wakeup call to the WWE because Smackdown is sucking bad right now."
1,Unreliable. Defective battery,"I bought this UPS and only have an iMac plugged into it. Shortly after I bought (about a couple of months) this the overload light kept coming on and shutting down. The battery didn't even work like it was supposed to. The power goes out, and so does your computer. I would avoid this unit. Yes, it's cheaper than most but you get what you pay for. Actually, in my case less than what I paid for."
4,Some chooglin' good stuff!,"This is an excellent example of Kenny Neal's downhome blues. Recorded in Florida with his road band at the time, which included the much under-rated Lucky Peterson on keyboards, Ken Johnson on drums and either Noel or Darnell Neal on bass ( best to keep it in the family!) it displays the width of Neal's many styles.Favourites are ""That knife don't cut no more"" in which he gets to stretch out and ""Do I have to go that far?"" Apart from some second guitar from Pat Rush on ""Going to the Country"" the album sounds pretty much like the band on the road did at the time. Finally, special mention for two excellent cover versions which to my mind transcend the originals, namely ""I can read between the lines"" and Chris Youlden's ""You aint foolin me"". Close your eyes and the band are there playing for you!"
3,Access Code does Not work,Book is good but access code to research database does not work. Contacted research Navigator service and simply said code was not valid....Book is fine but just don't count on the access code.
3,broken!,"I was so excited to find this expensive textbook for less on Amazon. When I received it, however, I realized why it was discounted: the binding is broken, and that fact was not advertised in the description that I read before purchasing the text. In fact, the seller advertised it as being in ""good"" condition."
3,not for the general reader,"Not that bad considering it's straight exposition. Since the info is all derived from either first-hand observation or from talking to the Indians and traders as peers it's free from academic stodginess. There's also a fair amount of anecdote which livens things somewhat. I'm a little disappointed that the author omitted certain material because it was too filthy and disgusting. Nothing's too filthy or disgusting for me. There was, however, a couple juicy items in the section about the Crows. For one thing, the young bucks were totally shameless about having sex in full view of others. And the other was a footnote that said the Crows were so horny they'd have sex with their mares and freshly killed animals! Wow! Cool!But you really gotta be a die hard frontier narrative fan to slog through this."
4,"Value for the information, not the prejudice","I entirely agree with the other reviewer that Denig was very prejudiced about Native Americans. For me, the value in the book - and it is great - is to have rare information about these tribes before their near-disappearance. Denig seems to save his harshest criticisms for the tribes that were most independent, and his stories about these groups give us a glimpse into their lives. I would very much recommend this book to people who are interested in the early 19th century world of the Upper Missouri."
5,As Good As The First 36th Chamber,"The thrid film in the 36th chamber trilogy holds it's own, with lots of action and humor that's not over the top. For Gordon Liu fans, even though he is not the main character, he appears enough to sastisfy your excitement about seeing him in another great Shaw Brother's film. If you like old school Kung Fu, this is a must for your collection!"
3,Disciples of the 36th Chamber,"The first one in the series was way better than this one. The only major fighting scene was the one at the end. There just wasn't enough fighting scenes for me in this one. I'm just not used to a dvd with Gordon Lu in it that isn't riddle with fighting scenes. Although it has a predictable, yet decent plot, I was just expecting more from a dvd was supposed to tie up the series.If you're considering purchasing this dvd know that the best fighting scene is at the end. If you are used to excessive fighting scenes, loads of treachery, bloodshed, gore, and guts flying everywhere, this dvd is not the one for you - that would be ""House of Traps""."
2,6000 LOUSY Reviews.,"Obviously the author is over his head here--probably too many tastings for one person. Also, he has a unfortunate tendency towards over-rating domestics, and apparently little understanding of the most interesting, rare styles of beer (he gives Cantillon lambic something like a 20 out of 100 (less than some American ""premium"" lagers) because it's ""too sour."") You might as well criticize Scotch as being ""too peaty."" Frankly, I haven't found any beer reviewer that I agree with more than half the time other than the great beer diety, Michael Jackson. The notes on the tasting process, however, are well laid out and the process explained in clear terms--I guess that's the best thing I can say...It's mostly the beer reviews themselves that are lame."
5,Fantastic,"Amazing control of the battlefield and of your soldiers with a very realistic feel. If you have any doubt about whether or not to buy this game think no more, just go for it. It is a fantastic game and it won awards on IGN for Best strategy, use of sound, online game, and game of the year. In addition to that, Relic, the studio that produced it won the award for best developer due to Company of Heroes. Great game"
5,One of the best RTS ever,"Excellent game, hopefully new patches will be released soon to help improve this great game. I have recommended it to all my friends."
5,Awesome doesn't quite describe it,"I've been working the demo, and the demo shows a tremendous game. The game itself all but matches most cinematics in terms of quality (the cinematics are downright stunning!), and the characters have almost no pixelization or triangulation. Visually, it is, by far, the most beautiful game I've ever seen. The game play is very realistic. So far, my only complaint is that starting in skirmish mode, I'm still struggling to find ways to fight tanks early in the battle (the sticky bombs are limited in effectiveness), but I expect that will come in time. This definitely goes on my wish list."
4,Great RTS Game,"One of the best RTS games I've every played. And you sure can't beat the price. But, the reason I'm writing a review is because when I first got the game, I played through it just fine. I wanted to play through it again, and thought I'd go ahead and patch it. Ever since I patched it, the game crashes. I can't continue past a certain map because it always crashes on me. So, unless you plan to play online, you may want to hold off on patching it till you've had a chance to play through it once."
2,Half a game?,when i got this game i thought i could use all the parts of a game. I know there is expansion of the game but i did not know that you need to bye the newest company of heroes to use most of the game. if you want to play one player you can only play 1/6th of it. and if you want to play multilayer you can but you cant do all that other people can with the latest COH they can customize there army. you can't so over all the part of this game that i played is a good game. but there is A LOT of the game that I Cant play.
5,Sometimes Looks Are Everything...,"This is a great game. Great fun. Certainly the best RTS (of this kind) I ever played as far as the overall experience goes.Realistically speaking, the game is carried a lot by its graphics and physics. Calling in an airstrike for instance blows stuff up so spectacularily that it is hard not to feel a great sense of accomplishment.On the downside, one could point out that it is a somewhat shallow game. There really aren't that many units and upgrades and all that. The gameplay mechanics remain mostly unchanged. There certainly are relatively few innovations here. But considering how well it is all put together, this isn't a bad thing.This game is fun and easy to play, and that counts for a lot in my book. After all, there are other choices if I want more complexity..."
1,bad game,I did not like the game because the action is not in first person as crysis or call of duty and separate operating controls are hard with little player interasion with.
3,"good game, online crash too often","Very good game, but very buggy online, can't finish 1/2 of the games online, keep getting Data-Sync error.One of the best RTS games I played so far.Update: after a few patches, it's working better.I played this on line a lot, 1 on 1 is very playable, beyond that it'scatch 22. I got up to level seven on 1 on 1, the ranked system is very good, you get good matches. Buy this."
3,Company of Heros,This is a good game. A little tuff at first. I realy like that map sizes. There are many types of units to keep your interest and the engineers are a blast! :-)ThanksLance LeClair
2,"fun game, unfortunately buggy for me.","this is a great game that I would not hesitate rating a 5 overall for, but unfortunately it crashes way too much for me to enjoy it. I am playing this game on a new computer, and even after downloading the most recent patch for it (1.4) it still has horrible crashes that prevent me from enjoying it.it will get a 5 from me when the crashing issues are fixed."
3,Company of Heroes,The game itself was disappointing. I was expecting something more exciting. As much as I dislike the game the provider was great by sending the game so i get it on time.
2,Messed up,Freezes up while playing. There is no color. When I installed it it looked like it would be in color but then all of a sudden it all turned into black andWhite. Ruins the effect of the game.
3,Not very sophisticated,Game was easy to learn (which I am still doing) but does not hold my attention as well as Axis and Allies that I had several years ago.
3,Meh,"Itsnot as fun as i thought, its to arcade like how a rifle squad can survive against a tank for like 5 mins."
4,Solid RTS experience,"I picked up Company of Heroes (COH) since I had played World in Conflict (WIC), which was quite a similar game. COH is of a similar style (it came out first I believe). Overall, the single player is quite fun and playing on hard-mode can be very challenging. No comment for multi as I have not tried that yet.Only complaint is sometimes the missions feel a bit tedious and the units not as responsive to your input since it is squad based rather than individual units (like SC2), and I felt WIC was the faster paced action-RTS (but it was released at a later date).Still a solid buy - especially at this price point; great entertainment value for the money."
5,RTS+WW2=CoH,"CoH is a great game.The campaign is awesome, the skirmish let you play against the AI in4 modes from easy to hard, also you can play with friends in LAN-festsor can go online and play against anyone is connected.Very realistic effects, the sounds, you can play it over & over.The fun is always there!"
5,It makes the struggle of learning a lot more fun!!!!!,"As a beginner, this book has built my confidence and given me the opportunity to play songs that I have loved for years. It is very easy to understand and makes all of those long hours playing scales worth it!!!! A must for any music fan."
4,"Good book, but wrong book.",I ordered this book but received the one with 89 songs. Change the picture to the book you're really offering.
5,Excelent pack as good as the original,"This is all you need. I bought this battery for a Canon Elura 100 and I am very satified with the battery life. Do not expect the battery to recharge in a couple of hours, you should do it overnight."
4,drawings of Fragonard,"the book this good for its price and size, but I had liked that had but landscapes and the illustrations to color that he has in the the technique of three crayones. and the impression is something clear, without force, but as I love everything what has to do with this artist, I am very contented"
3,It serves its purpose,The product I ordered was just what I needed at the time and fits my phone just fine. It came in the mail promptly. The color does not match but I knew this when I ordered it because I couldn't find the exact color match at the time.
4,Works Well,"I bought this stuff before and it works well!!!However, I forgot to put it down this past spring and my neighbor decided to use it too.So of course, ALL the grubs from HIS yard came over to MY yard. The bag states that once put down for 2 years and 2 seasons, it would last for 10 years. This is NOT true, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.When you first the milky spore down, within 2 weeks, I saw dead grubs all over the place AND it is SAFE for Pets too!!!!"
4,Confusing,"This page says use once per season, but the bag says use three times per year for two years in a row. Which is correct?"
3,We'll see,"Yes, it is hard to spread. Other than that we'll have to wait and see if it works next spring. First time user."
3,"not bad, but i think powder is better","I think the powder is better in every respect. First in terms of convenience, although this is easier to drop than the powder since you can use a spreader, this has to be repeated on a much more frequent basis. So even if each application is a little faster, you spend more time out there, over and over. In terms of value, the powder based application ends up cheaper as well over the whole program. I've tried both and will stick to powder from now on."
5,I'm lost of all Words,What can I say? All I know that I bought this soundtrack out of the blue (I did not see the movie). This is the first Maurice Jarr soundtrack I have bought. Jarr composed one of the the best themes I have ever heard. If you like good music get this now(note: the soundtrack is fairly short. It is only 36:05 minutes long)
3,Brilliant 'Mississippi saxophone',"Carey Bell gets 5 stars for his harmonica playing ('Mississippi saxophone'), however the album only gets 3 stars for overall effect. It is still quite a reasonable album but only hits the highlights when Carey plays his harp. There is occasionally some interesting keyboards from Lucky Peterson and guitar from Carl Weathersby and Lurrie Bell. However, the album is only memorable when Carey shows his stuff, none better than on 'Must I holler' and on the instrumental 'easy'."
4,This is the blues!,"This the blues plain and simple. In a day and age of wannabes and phonies, its nice to hear the sound of the real blues still shines forth.The harmonica tone on this album is real serious,Heavy-duty! Bell runs the whole Gamut of blues from Funk to chicken-picking. Its well-worth your money and time. Long Live The Delta Blues!"
3,I remember...,This was one of the first commercial DVD titles I authored for this client back in the day.It's good to know it's still being used:)
5,A must-have for any Oasis collector outside the U.S.,"Oasis collectors around the world don't have the chance to see some releases like this in their own country, so that's why this is an important buy for any Oasis singles collection outside the United States because it is different in its content and comes in a standard jewell case, very rare for Oasis singles collectors who are more familiarized with single cases, the slim ones. Beautiful number one single!"
2,Not a hi lift blade,In the description or anywhere else dose it say that there a low lift blade so i assumed that they were a hi lift blade but in receiving them found that they were a low lift. Now what am i going to do with 6 worthless low lift blades?
3,another average release but it's still melodic.,"Too me the scorps never made a average release until 'face the heat' and then this one , which still has some wonderfully played songs on it. But there were just too many ballads on this one for me. The bite was gone here and I think 'eye to eye' was a stronger release than this one was. Still a average scorps cd is better than alot of other metal out there. like most thrash metal for instance."
4,Mellow but good,"After putting out a dozen or so metal albums, the Scorpions seemed to mellow out with this one. I kept waiting for it to rock out, but it just doesn't (well, a little at times, but not like a regular Scorpions album). That said, the songs are GOOD. It's not burdened by a bunch of lame ballads like Aerosmith's 90's work. And it's still the Scorpions - they don't try to jump on the bandwagon of the ""current"" popular sound of the time, which is good for those of us who hated grunge and ""Alternative""! There's a nice variety of feels, with some nice acoustic and keyboard work - reminiscent of some of their earlier songs like ""Is There Anyone There"" off LOVEDRIVE."
2,"Horrible effort, No sting whatsoever","The Scorpions truly miss the mark on this one. For a Scorpions fan who must have everything, go ahead and buy it. For anyone else, this is their worst album, so stay away.It's as though the band wrote no new material and put out an album of B-sides from the almost-as-bad Face the Heat.If this is the best the Scorpions can do, they won't be around much longer. Truly sad, the downfall of a great band."
2,Gold Ballads II,"Sadly so, in 11 songs there's like 8 or 9 ballads. Not that all songs are bad but this is definately one hell of a boring cd. Stone in my Shoe and Wild Child are the only really rockers, as for the ballads: ""You & I"" ,with a similar structure to Still Lovin' You, is actually the only one worthy of the tag Scorpions. Buy this if you are mostly interested in ballads, if you want stings better look at the pre Live Bites albums."
1,Their worst,"The Scorpions are my favorite band but I even thought this CD s*cked. It seems like the scorpions might have permanantly lost their sting since Crazy World, cuz Face the heat s*cked too.Its sad to see a great (and my favorite) band sink themselves to this level.If you have never heard the Scorpions, hearing this will make you never want to hear their best work"
2,Some good songs but boring and lacks power,"Some of the songs on this album are ok, like ""You and I"" and ""But the Best For You"", but overall this lacks the power of the Scorpions. If you think regular Scorpions ballads are too hard for you then this might be for you, otherwise you should look at their older releases, like ""Blackout"" and ""Love at First Sting""."
3,Scorpio,CD came in a couple days 2 songs are scratched and CD player does not recognize. CD was purchased used and a little disappointed by scratches but must be expected when you buy used. Rating on condition gave impression CD was not scratched ?
2,Get another translation.,"This is one of my favorite Platonic dialogues, an analysis of both rhetoric and love which leads to some compelling discussions. However, the translation offered by Pengin Classics is hideously lacking. I can't put my finger on exactly where it goes wrong, but the translator makes it a pain to get through just one page. Everything seems laborous and technical, including the normally exquisite speeches.Get another translation instead. Might I suggest the one published by Hackett? Or perhaps Cornell University Press? Both of those translations take care to make the dialogue as lively annd exciting as it rightfully should be."
4,Good Item,The Book was awesome and its still almost new....the shipping was really fast i got in before the scheduled time.!!!
4,Highly Imaginative and Funny,"Writers have always been attracted to circuses and carnivals. Marilyn Singer is no exception. But in her circus, there's more going on than meets the eye (or claw). Solly, her main character, has been stepped on by life (and especially by his step mother and step brothers). But when the circus enters his life, along with various lizards, the scales start to tip in his direction. Why does the ring master seem to know so much about him? Who is the mysterious little girl he keeps running into? And why does his father have such a strange reaction to lizards? Everything is tied together with wit and humor, making this book a fun and satisfying read."
3,This Circus is Loony,"This is an odd little story with some bizzare twists and turns that ultimately entertains but does not satisfy the reader. Solomon Yanish is the youngest of three boys in a disfunctional family. Solly quickly realizes there is a connection between his mothers disappearance six years ago and the return of the Circus Lunicus. The first half of the book reads like a whimsical mystery as Solly creeps around the circus trying to discover it's secrets. The second half of the book is a science fiction farce. Solly's toy lizard becomes a real six foot tall reptile named Freeble. She helps Solly become a reptile too! Solly finds out that the whole circus crew are from planet Reptilia. Eventually, we find out that Solly's mom is a reptilian and that they came back to reclaim Solly as one of their own. In one of the more ""realistic"" passages, Solly and his stepmother argue and she smacks him. While this is a bizzare enough tale to hold a child's attention, it lacks focus and meaning."
3,"Favorite rainboot, but do not really last :(","I actually bought this exact rainboot a year and a half ago (Fall of 2006) at Macy's. I absolutely love them and get at least 2 or 3 compliments everytime I wear them, a lot of them being from people that you wouldn't expect to like skulls etc.My only complaint is that I have worn them fairly spairingly for the past year and a half and they are totally worse for wear. I started noticing about 6 months ago that my socks would be soaked when I took my boots off at the end of the day, and the bottoms were totally split beyond repair -- I know because I tried myself and it helped for half a day but then they were split again.But of course being a slave to fashion I am buying another pair here on Amazon, I just hope the new pair does not split again. If so they really should lower the price."
2,One season wonder.,"Cute, and did their job for the first season I had them, but by the following spring both boots were leaking... A LOT! Very disappointing for the money."
4,"What You See is What You Get, my review from Barcelona","'What you see is what you get"" simply a fantastic record, Lil Ed who was a nephew and very worthy successor of the brilliant J.B.HUTTO and also follower of the ways of the not less genial HOUND ""Dog"" TAYLOR nowadays is one of the main craftsman of Chicago Blues and the Blues in general. With respect to this wonderful record all songs shine at a same level although for me the three slow Blues ""Older woman"", ""Living room for today"", ""Long long way from home"" and the song which gives the title to the record ""What you see is what you get"" they seem me really fascinating, by the way this last jump blues which gives the title to the record could have called ""What you hear is what you get"" and it have been likewise very good. Well, coming to the point a record for my between 4 and 4,5 stars, first class Blues, highly recommended."
5,Apple Power Mac G4,"The Apple Power Mac G4 is a great computer that is full of expansion and upgrade possibilities and has a wide assortment of ports and features. The super drive allows burning of DVD media two internal drive bays are easy to access with the opening side door. This computer can be used as an iTunes server, file server, web server and runs Apple OSX server software.Apple Power Mac G4 - MT - 1 x PPC G4 933 MHz - RAM 256 MB - HDD 1 x 60 GB - CD-RW / DVD-R - GF4 MX - Mdm - Gigabit Ethernet - MacOS X 10.1 / MacOS 9.2 - Monitor : none"
4,"""If You Want Bud""","This is a 2-CD Set, Disc One is a re-issue of ""Last of a Dying Breed"" with two bonus tracks, Van Halen's ""Take Your Whiskey Home"" and The Cult's ""Peace Dog"" with added vocals from Jason McMaster. Disc Two is an Eleven track Live show from 2000 recorded with the John Schwab Mobile Unit with very good sound, It includes several covers including Alice Cooper's ""I'm Eighteen"" and Motorhead's ""Out of the Sun""."
1,Very Elementary,This book reads like it was written for 5th graders. I was very excited about the story but I couldn't get through it. Very juvenile structure.
3,Well...,"You can't say it isn't good, but you could say it wasn't what you might expect. The change from ""American..."" to ""Eight..."" was pretty drastic to me, and this album seems to rely on what makes Veruca Salt Veruca Salt: softhardsofthard. So if you liked their first two releases, this won't disappoint you. Never heard them before? Try out ""American Thighs."" Far and away my favorite."
3,"Not bad, not special","On this album, Veruca Salt sounds kind of like Hole, but fails to be as good. I did enjoy some songs, like ""Yeah Man,"" ""Hellraiser"" and ""Disconnected."" ""Yeah Man"" and ""Hellraiser"" are fun songs, and ""Disconnected"" has a great melody behind a continuous backbeat. Louise sounds pretty good on the songs with the exception of ""All Dressed Up."" But it just seems like something is missing to give a lot of these songs fire. For one thing, it could have used fewer slow then rowdy-type styles. It also tends to meld together, keeping things from staying fresh."
1,Terrible. Just terrible.,"What a nightmare. It's hard to believe that this band had anything to do with the original Veruca Salt. Same lame tempo shifts in every song it seems. They play soft, and then hit it hard trick has been tired for years before this album came out, and uses it it seems on *every* track. It was years since I had the misfortune of picking this one up, and obviously still leaves a very bad taste."
2,The talent is gone,"After listening to this album, it's clear that Nina Gordon was the real talent behind this band. Sorry, Louise, but you're doomed to the same fate as the other guy in Wham. Go buy Tonight and the Rest of My Life, and see why Nina is drawing comparisons to Amy Mann and Shawn Colvin. And Louise...was Dave Grohl really worth losing your career over?"
3,music fan from missouri,"Overall, a decent album. Doesn't live up to the standard set by their previous two releases though. Seems that Nina Gordon possessed the majority of the talent in the group (check out her solo and you'll hear why), but she's gone. While Louise Post has a lot of talent, it seems that she needed Gordon to help her achieve her full potential. While Veruca Salt is still good, they would be better if the band hadn't went there own ways."
1,"Nina Gordon, Please Come Back!","Life isn't going to good for Louise Post these days. With the departure of Nina Gordon and the rest of Veruca Salt, Louise hoped to bring the band back into the harsh music world with the new VS album, ""Resolver"". Sorry Louise, this CD doesn't quite cut it. I will admit that I am a fan of Veruca Salt's earlier stuff (""American Thighs"", ""Eight Arms To Hold You"") but this...this is just not the Veruca Salt I grew to love. ""Resolver"" is basically the same song played over and over again 13 times. You know how it goes...soft singing, LOUD chorus. How boring! This CD isn't the worst record I've ever heard though, there is one fairly decent song on the record, and thats ""Born Entertainer"". I just hope Louise Post realizes that she does not fit that title in any way, shape, or form. Sorry Veruca Salt, this CD is a major disapointment."
5,Veruca Salt...new style,"I had strong doubts about this album because I love Nina Gordon. But I had just gotten Nina's solo album, and she did good without Veruca Salt. So I wanted to see how Veruca Salt's doing without her. I was impressed! Louise is still as strong as ever. But I have a strong feeling that most of the songs are about Nina's departure (""this couldn't get any better, she didn't get it so f*ck her""). But I still love it, love it, love it! I like all the songs. My absolute favorite is probably ""Used to Know Her"". ""Imperfectly"" is a little sad, but I love sad songs! So, if you're a Veruca Salt fan, don't hesitate to buy this album, it's terrific. But I'm warning you, Nina's song styles are gone. It's pure Louise. So if you're a fan of her songs like ""Shutterbug"", ""Venus Man Trap"", and ""One Last Time"", Get it!"
3,I miss the original Veruca Salt,"This is a good album but I gave it 3 stars because it is no where near as good as EATHY. ""Born Entertainer"", ""Officially Dead"", ""Only You Know"", and ""I Used to Know Her"" are all great songs but they are missing the really catchy hooks that Nina used to provide VS. Let's hope that Nina and Louise can work out their differences and can reunite in the future to continue on with VS because VS is much better with both them working together."
5,Gets even better with repeat listenings,"I bought Louise Post's ""Resolver"" and Nina Gordon's ""Tonight..."" on the same day and, as a die-hard Veruca Salt fan, liked them both for different reasons. Now with the years passing, I feel Nina's album seems too glossy and stale(like a '90's Helen Reddy)and Post's music still staggers me. ""The Same Person""(brief but evocative)is like a quiet fire of inner-empowerment, strong enough to strengthen shaken lives(it's used again as a bridge on ""Only You Know"" to terrific effect). ""Resolver"" (great title!!) is extremely well-produced, affecting, angry but resonant and vivid. Louise's lyrics ring clear and true with fury and bitterness. She may not know where she's headed--or who to blame--but she's in the process of getting her head together, and this multi-layered, hard-rocking effort is the incredible result. A-"
2,Unresolved issues,"I was really looking forward to this album. Really. When I finally got around to buying it, I was also looking forward to listening to it. My only pronouncement is that Louise Post needs some assistance. Without her original bandmates, she just can't hold her own, and the juvenile musings on this CD get on my nerves. It's as if she's trying too hard to sound profound and introspective, with the eventual outcome of just sounding superficial. Come on! Veruca Salt's other endeavors have really set the bar high, I know, but Resolver is an absolute disappointment. There just isn't enough rock to this album--it wavers between soft ballady-type things to the insistent wailing of electric guitar. Ah well. I guess I'll have to find another use for my copy of Resolver. Frisbee, anyone?"
2,Bring in the pall bearers!,"There were hints of this, wrapped in great music, on the last Veruca CD(and I mean ""last""), but let's face it, Veruca Salt as we know and love it is D-E-A-D dead. Bad lyrics, bad voice, bad guitar, at least I'll be able to use the disc as a coaster for a cold frosty beverage while I kick out the walls listening to my original Minty Fresh American Thighs CD while pining for the early years, great hooks, and bad v-grrrrl harmonies."
1,YUCK!,"I read all of these great reviews for REVOLVER...I've had it for about two weeks now and not ONE song has grown on me. And i'm an impressionable guy. To be fair, i bought Nina Gordon's CD on the same day. I can't get her songs out of my head! I used to like veruca salt....they have changed so much since Nina Gordon left. I'm glad Nina got away and worked with new people, especially Jon Brion, who is a genius (and my secret crush). In summary...VS - Bad. Nina - good."
2,Dam the fools.......,"BAH! I just listened to both CD's, saw Nina on Jay Leno the other day, and am in heartache. Neither of these CD's could raise my pulse. They both are missing something...the other girl....I wonder if I play both at the same time if it will sound any better......Oh well, thanks much Amazon for having samples which make music buying MUCH easier and safer."
3,Average,"The writer's many mistakes made while translating and even copying German titles and bibliographical details weaken the confidence I have in this work's accuracy, despite what his mate J Hayward says below. I just read an article by Claasen in a strat journal I subscribe to and it suffers from the exact same weakness (v. unreliable German trans). The very first endnote had an obvious copying error, and so did many others! All this notwithstanding the Claasen Norway book has good photos and a generally interesting narrative. It is worth a read, but grad students and others wanting precision will need to go elsewhere."
3,Average,"The cover is nice, but the contents are unusually average. The author struggles to write well without polemic, hyperbole, mixed metaphors and so on. This fault is common to academics who also want to appear masters of prose. They over-do it. The high number of typos in the German endnotes and bilbliographical entries suggested to me that the writer's German is weak and maybe untrustworthy. But the book deals with a safe and non controversial topic anyway. The book is a chronicle and is detailed in places and patchy in other places. Worth reading but not as good as I had hoped having read three other books in the series this belongs to."
5,Outstanding Military History,"Professor Claasen and Joel Hayward, of ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" fame, both teach in New Zealand. No offense to Kiwis, but what a waste!! These guys are great writers, and this book is more than a look at the Luftwaffe's role in the little-remarked upon Norwegian front. Just as in Hayward's book, there is much discussion on the Kriegsmarine's operations, all of it fascinating. For example, I have read a lot on WWII (believe me), but until this book I did not know the US Navy ran a carrier operation off the Norwegian coast using the USS Ranger! I can most confidently recommend this book to any WWII buff. It is very well-written, and extremely informative."
3,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""SON, I HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH! THE STARS DON'T LIE!""","Son Seals, is what Shaq, ""The King Of The World Blues Reviewer"", would affectionately, dub, ""A Good Road House or Juke Joint"" blues player. No disgrace in that. He's just not a star. This CD fits that moniker. There are some good, cooking, songs, that make you tap your feet, and sway in your chair. Some don't. The best and longest cut on this CD, happens to be dedicated by Son to HIS IDOL, & SHAQ'S ORIGINAL ALL-TIME FAVORITE ELECTRIC BLUES GUITARIST: MR. ALBERT KING!! Son, even refers to Albert as his mentor."
3,Son usually shines,"If you can get past the hideous cover (painted by a record company executive's blind, one-handed, 10-year-old daughter, perhaps?) there's some fine Son Seals blues here, that, despite a couple weak tracks, really grows on you. Certainly not as good as his first two albums, but a cut above, say, ""Living in the Danger Zone."""
4,Great book for young people,"I bought this book for my grandson, but I read it before I sent it to him. It is a good book, although A bit outdated, but it definitely sent a powerful message."
5,"Incredible book, well written.","This book had a lot of action, suspense, and drama. I thought it was a high quality book and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys gang stories or action books. Durango Street kept u on the edge of the seat and would not let you put the book down."
5,slammin the rap video magazine,i really like this video only beacuse it had roxanne shante in it and sisne i really dont get to see shante in a lot of other videos
5,Simply awesome!!,"This dvd is just awesome! It really makes you feel like you're there. I saw this show live a few times during this tour and this dvd totally captures the look and the feel and the sound of the show. Ricky is best seen live, but this is the next best thing. The songs are terrific, the dancing is amazing, the lighting is inspired and the moving catwalks are just so cool! Ricky sounds and looks so hot! The way that the old songs were re-done really gave them a fresh sound. Revolution simply rocks! The newer songs are terrific too - Pegate starts out the show and brings you to your feet. Tu Recuardo with Mari is just beautiful. This is a must-have dvd!"
5,Black & White is the best show of 2007,"Fui testigo del excelente show que Ricky presentó en el Choliseo de PR. Ricky es un artista que ofrece un espectáculo insuperable. Su presencia escénica y carisma se transmite en forma fiel por este excelente DVD. Es emocionante ver la madurez de Ricky en el escenario y su invitación seria a reflexionar de la vida, a ser agradecido y a estar dispuestos a ser agentes de cambio ante un mundo proliferado de problemáticas sociales."
4,It was great if you speak spanish,"I really enjoyed this concert dvd. It had two sections, one for Spanish another for English. I saw it both but was a bit disappointed that the English version didnt have any subtitles or anything to help the English speakers. I didnt need it but I feel for those that dont understand Spanish."
5,The best price fo this unique cologne.,"I am planning to buy this product at Amazon, mainly because this cologne has been increasing its price through the years and now is ridiculous to buy it at department stores when you can have it at Amazon por almost half the price. Guerlain Imperiale is THE ONLY cologne for men! Once you try it, you will never use another one."
5,i cried!!,"OH mY goodness!!! If you are going to see the movie, I advise you also buy the CD! It is one of the best movies Disney has come out with and the song melodies and lyrics are touching and beautiful! Especially ""There is life"" and ""Through your eyes"". It is 100% worth the 12 dollars!"
5,One of Shorter's all-time best,"The all-time peak of Shorter's playing is his work from the early-to-mid 60s. There's a level of creativity and spiritual depth, both as a composer and improviser, that hasn't been seen in his work since. His association with Miles was part of the reason. I suspect that the other was inspiration from his partnership with Teruka Nakagami (pictured on the cover of Speak No Evil). Tracks on his three best albums (Juju, Night Dreamer, and Speak No Evil)were inspired by her and the child (Miyako) they had together. The playing on all three albums is that of a man deeply moved. Speak No Evil was recorded after Wayne and Teruka went their separate ways, but the album is clearly a tribute to her. If only we could all end a relationship so beautifully."
2,Avoid RVG editions,"Like many ""Rudy Van Gelder Edition"" the sound of this record has been deeply degraded by the remastering. The sound level has been pumped up with very unpleasant compression effects in particular on the cymbals. The overall sound has now a vague resemblance to the sound of live Jazz.What a shame that Rudy Van Gelder (the engineer of many fantastic records in the 50's and 60's) gave its name to this vandalism."
4,Haven't spent enough time with the album for final judgement but...,the playing is really solid. Shorter has some really nice melodic runs and makes some cool choices as a composer. Obviously the backing band is the cats pajamas. I don't really know where it stands yet on my favorite albums list- but if you're a fan of Shorter I can't really imagine that you would be disapointed by this outing.
5,Addictive,"Re-discovering this album on CD format was like meeting a dear old friend after a long time. This one keeps spinning on my CD player at least twice a week. This, a true masterpiece among Shorter's prolific catalogue on Blue Note. The formidable line-up does more than ""blowin' through"" Shorter's lovely originals. Noted with delight that Rudy van Gelder's re-mastering has done perfect justice to the analogue magic of the original vinyl. Bonus alternate take of ""Dance Cadaverous"" lets one compare the solos and Elvin Jones's elusive cross-rhythms. Blue Note lives!!"
3,I Recommend Others...,"I'm no jazz musician, and while I appreciate all the musicians and musicianship on this album (what a lineup!), it doesn't stand up to many of Shorter's other albums (for me). It's slow and meandering, and doesn't pack the same punch for me as his other work. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Shorter, both as a Jazz Messenger and as a solo artist. He's one of my favorite sax players besides Coltrane. I recommend the following Shorter CD's, which satisfied me much more than this outing: Adam's Apple, Night Dreamer, and Soothsayer, and any of his work with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. I think the cut ""Mahjong"" off Juju is one of the most beautiful pieces I've ever heard."
1,lost on the way home.,"The Corrs are insanely talented Irish musicians. Their background and talents have for years begged the question that they produce a roots album. Purportedly, this album, ""Home"", is the result.If you enjoy the superscrubbed, sterile, overproduced sound of their pop albums, then you will enjoy this album. As usual, there is not a single spontaneous note on the whole album, and no risks were taken. The Corrs have the potential to make an electrifying Irish roots album, but ""Home"" is not it. For starters they would need to ditch their usual producer, Mitchell Froom, who also produced ""Home"". Froom is a decidedly pop producer, and, unfortunately, a pop album is what he and the Corrs have produced. Given their enormous potential, this album is, thus, a huge disappointment for those awaiting a roots album from the Corrs."
2,Not Ready For Irish Prime Time,"I bought this CD for my girlfriend who has gotten into Irish folk music just recently. She quite likes it but I was disappointed with it.The problem with The Corrs and some other Irish & English performers is that they feel a need to adopt a 'mid-atlantic' accent while singing, which means much of their native tongue goes missing. This works well for pop & rock etc but less so for folk singing.Irish artists like Maura O'Connell, Mary Black or even Enya in a pinch could have performed any of these songs better than The Corrs.I did note that acoustic guitars made in Northern Ireland were used on the CD - that was a nice touch. Otherwise The Corrs should stick to the bubble gum, eye candy pop singing they're used to."
3,Misleading description,"Buyer beware. This only had 12 tracks and despite the description on this page DOES NOT include the extra track ""Return To Fingal"" !! :--( If you don't care then save 50% off this price by buying at your local store."
5,Gorgeous Irish Music,"There will probably be no radio pop hits from this record. Still if you're a Corrs fan or a fan of traditional Irish music, this one is for you. Long criticized for going pop and moving away from their Irish sound, this record will silence those critics once and for all."
1,Good Traditional Irish songs ruined,"Am a Corrs fan, so was eager for this new album ... a trip back to their Irish roots. Unfortunately, all I can take from the album are the ""breathy"" vocals ... you hear EVERY SINGLE intake of breath between notes and its VERY DISTRACTING! I realize breathing is necessary, but it shouldn't be so front and center in each arrangement. As it stands, I can't bear to try a second listen. Move further from the mike already!"
4,Home,"Beautiful instrumentals are showcased on this record of some traditional covers by the band. Vocal harmonies are good too as always. I would have liked the bonus track from the Japanese version rather than new versions of ""Old Town"" and ""Haste to the Wedding."" Beautiful, thoughtful music."
4,The vocals are simply angelic,"The Irish songstresses are back with a less pop oriented affair. Home is a collection of traditional Irish songs reinterpreted by The Corrs. This is an acoustic album that blends in orchestral elements. The songs are ten times better than any Irish pub song (you'll recognize a few of those), and the vocals are simply angelic. When the songs on Home aren't bringing a tear to you're eye, they're sure to make you smile."
4,"Excellent, but different.","The Corrs have been my favorite band ever since I first heard ""Breathless"" on country (yes, that's right) radio.Ever since then, i have bought every Corrs album. When i bought this one, however, I knew i wasnt going to be treated to the same pop that defines all their previous work.This album is very good, though. I listened to it for the first time when i was getting ready for bed, and i fell asleep right after the cd ended, it was that relaxing.All of the tracks are very light traditional Irish songs with somewhat silly lyrics. Nothing like I've ever heard before. The instrumentals, in all their albums, have been some of my favorite songs of all time! The two included on this album, Haste to the Wedding and Old Hag, are more traditional sounding, and truly better for it.Top tracks on this album:1. Old Town2. Buachaill On Eirne3. Haste to the Wedding4. Old Hag"
3,"Great Song Selection, but over-produced","I agree with an earlier reviewer who said The Corrs failed to take any risks with this album. I do however think it brave of them to include two songs in Irish as well as the instrumentals. That being said, I would have liked the overall sound to be indicative of a pub session or a sing along held at someone's home on a cool summer evening in Kerry. The band obviously have the roots to pull off such an album, and it would have been nice to see these songs done in such a manner. My biggest gripe in regards to production is the overly processed vocals that sound very Britney/Christina/Jessica. Hats off to them for including the Phil Lynott song ""Old Town""--a wonderful picture of Dublin in the early 1980s that is long gone in this post Celtic Tiger age."
4,The Album They Just Had To Make,"Generally, I find Corrs albums to be a hit & miss affair. Some great tracks and some mediocre. But this is one that they really deliver on. Every track is beautifully polished and has an updated feel whilst still remaining true to the originals. Yes, it is an Irish-Trad album but it is not only this, it is good songs, beautifully delivered. If you love or even have a casual liking for Irish music, you should buy this album."
5,This is good speaker wire at a good price,"I consider myself an audiophile so when installing in-wall wires for my home theater I wanted to be sure I used quality cables. I do not believe that $10,000 speaker cables perform any better than any other oxygen free cable of the same gauge. These cables are 12 gauge, well constructed, and are very pliable so they are easy to snake through walls for installation. If you are looking for a high quality speaker cable I recommend them highly."
2,Not in good condition.,"This is a great book that is (unfortunately) out of print. I bought this used, but found that the description was very misleading. The last page of the book was torn out. Fortunately the seller handled the situation very well and quickly refunded the money. These things happen. No hard feelings."
1,It's a map.,I'm not happy because I needed a map showing all three states on a single sheet. I already have individual state maps that are better.
4,Feminine jazz,The openness of seasoned women telling it like it is was wonderful. The music is lively and has a great beat.
3,Strange book,"Be aware that this is a sort of extremely bleak magical realism -- almost like Beckett, but with lots more words."
1,Avoid this program - its cheap but you get what you pay for,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. It is almost impossible to make a correction once an entry is saved. In my case, I can not figure out how to change the account on a saved transaction The instructions in the manual don't work because I suspect they are incomplete. So the only option is to contact the company for help and at a whopping price! Some savings! Don't waste your money on this program. Buy Quickbooks or Peachtree and save yourself a lot of grief."
1,OOPS!,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6DWHW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleMeter burned up the first time I used it. Don't know why but it lit up like a Christmas tree when I used it to check voltage. The meter would make a GREAT PAPER WEIGHT. Mailing prices prevented me from sending it back. I don't recommend this meter to anyone.
2,Disappointed,"The concept is great -- the dances, and exercise, would be too, except it is very difficult to follow. I have probably owned 50 videos over the years, attended numerous exercise classes, and have a gym membership. Lisa, and all the others are facing you, cuing you to use your right when they are using their right. I have never had instruction where you do not mirror the person who is instructing when they are facing you, and I found it very frustrating to follow. Maybe it's just me being a creature of habit, but I think not."
1,Lisa Rinna: Dance Body Beautiful - Learn & Burn,This is the first time I've ever shared my opinion. This DVD is terrible. I love Dancing with the Stars and was so excited when I heard Lisa was doing a workout video. The moves and music don't work together. Lisa's cues are poor and the simple steps quickly lose their way.I am sad of the poor quality and returning the DVD today.
1,when will I learn?,"Someone save me from d-list 'stars' who fancy themselves as teachers of dance !! This DVD is beyond annoying... her management agency should be tied down and forced to listen to the whole tape for every voice grinding moment!One season on DWTS and she's a choreographer?...(poor Louie!) ... I guess hubris accompanied by greed knows no bounds! Her voice is hard to take, her cues, when there, are amateurish... all in all it's pretty much a waste of time. If you want to dance and get a workout at the same time go to or buy a Zumba tape!!Once day I'll learn... (sigh) ~"
1,Difficult to follow due to poor camera angles,"I was extremely disappointed. As a DWTS performer Lisa should have known to mirror her moves when teaching. The camera angles showed her hips when what I needed to see were her feet. I would prefer a constant full frontal or back view so I can follow her. Also the camera showed side views that made no sense. I gave up after trying to follow for a full 40 minutes. Equally discouraging was how the hustle was impossible to learn as presented, as was the Paso. I wondered where the director and producer were when this was being filmed. It seemed the camera person had free reign and was bored, so threw in creative shots that made learning the routines impossible."
5,FUN!!,"This is an ultra-fun routine and is a nice change of pace for me once a week! I love that it is something different and the dance moves are easy to pick up. Believe it or not, you actually work up quite a sweat doing this video! I have one of her other dance videos and love it too! Probably not a great video routine if you are looking for a really intense cardio workout and there is no weight bearing exercise w/ this one at all. But it is alot of fun and nice for ""lighter"" workout days!!"
2,Not a dance instructor and not exercise!,"Rinna is likable, has a great body and dances well. But she's not an instructor, and this is not a workout. The slow sections of each segment go on for far too long, and during them, you are not burning any more calories than you would ambling across the room. And the beginning segments are not well taught. Rinna's counts and instruction (or lack of instruction) on ""Fat-Free Hustle,"" for example, actually make what is a rather simple step difficult to learn. I love to dance, and I love cardio dance dvds if they work up a sweat and have clear cueing. For all its bright and shiny production, this DVD was a HUGE disapointment. I'll stick to the 10 Minute Solution cardio dance DVDs for my calorie burn."
2,Average,I love Lisa Rinna - I loved her on Dancing with the Stars...but her ability to demonstrate the steps necessary to use this work out effectively is lacking.
3,"Logic ok, but too many errors","Great book to prepare for the exam. Most of the information is in the right order and fairly well described. But what disturbes me the most are the errors in text and questions. Stupid sentences showing some lack of language skills or misunderstanding (""Reboot your system using bdf or mount""!!)"
3,Get the Braille version...,"If you are an experienced sysad, this is a good, quick read to prepare for the 3h-002 test. It is well organized, and helps to focus on testable material. One caveat, though, is that the Braille version might be better, because it looks as if a blind man proof-read the print version. Thankfully, the errors are laughably obvious, and actually add an entertainment value to the book."
4,Good book ... but many errors,"Excellent book to buy for preparation of the HP exam. You have to know UX very well to pick up the errors in the book, the errata does not cover them all. Anyone know how I can contact the author or someone who could rectify the errors for future buyers. As mentioned, you must know UX - then the book is an excellent well structured and writing guide for certification. I am Solaris certified, and only wish I could buy such a good book for that exams I did."
2,Poor Proof Reading!,Be very carful when using this book as a reference. I've found about a dozen errors just in the first 100 pages. Granted none of them (so far) probably would cause problems for an experienced admin...but...I'm sure not all of us fall into that catagory.
3,good but not great,"I read the book very carefully and found it to be helpful in general but not as in depth as the exam is. Combined with the fact that in several places he actually contradicts himself between what he says in the chapter and the answers to chapter questions...makes learning the material that much harder.In general though, for HP-UX admins and others who simply wish to broaden their horizons or as a reference manual, it is quite good."
4,"If you pay blues guitar, pay attention.","I was talking to a guy at a bar last night about how I used to go see ""this guy"" in my college town in Virginia who used to play with Muddy. Being from Chicago, the guy knew all about Steady Rollin'. I downloaded the MP3 album this morning, and am now on my third listening.If you pay blues guitar, pay attention. Tone, touch and feel, ""this guy's"" got it. Haven't seen him in 20 years, but now I'm starting to realize just how much my own playing is based on his.Bob Margolin's the real deal for sure."
3,Smile was only two-thirds complete,"I agree with Chris's review far below, which states that Priore was operating under a misconception. Brian Wilson has stated that the album was supposed to have three movements, and that only two movements (2/3 of the entire album!) had been completed at the time the album was scrapped. I think Priore was trying to convince himself that the Smile album wasn't actually ""lost,"" and that whatever bootlegged versions he'd strung together at home were close to the real thing. Nice try.Other than that, though, the book contains the most thorough collection of Smile-related essays available, so it gets three stars from this old-school Wilson fan."
3,It's not like new but it's ok.,"The description said the item condition was like new, but it has a bended corner and the back cover is dirty. Anyway it's ok for me."
4,Flawed gem of a book for a flawed diamond of a record!,"I truly, really like this book. It collects hundreds of pieces of news items, press releases, magazine articles, reviews, interviews, and much more, all pertaining to the Beach Boys never-released legendary and apocryphal ""Smile"". If one has never heard ""Smile"" one might wonder what it is/was, and what's all the hoopla for in the first place?The BEST intro to the Smile Sessions is the fan-produced ""Smile Store"" Interactive CDR. Once you've played the hundreds of outtakes, and gone through the day-by-day recording chronology, THEN this book will become worth it's weight in gold. Either the Vigotone or Sea of Smiles Bootleg CDs will also serve as a worthy introduction. THEN buy this book. You'll never hear Good Vibrations the same way again! :-)"
5,Buy It!,"This book should be required reading for any SMiLE enthusiast. Granted, it is not really a book, it is more of a scrapbook of magazine articles, newspaper articles, AFM Sheets, Music sheets, lyrics, pictures, essays, and cartoons. Also included is the famous Jules Siegel piece ""Goodbye Surfing, Hello God"". This is one of my favorite books to pick up and glance at for hours at a time. Also, it is a fairly big book, covering nearly 300 pages and it is chock full of information. Priore did a ridiculously good job of compiling all of these articles and clippings....this has to be the greatest album-related scrapbook of all time.This is mid-March 2011 and SMiLE has just been confirmed to be soon released sometime later this year. In light of this information, I implore anyone even remotely interested to buy a copy (used or new) of this book.5/5"
1,No Keyboard Configuation Makes playing very difficult,"Both my self and a friend (an avid space invaders player) were extemely disappointed in not being able to configue the keyboard keys to move myships with arrows instead of ""S"" & ""F"". Perhaps the Brits are used to thesekeys to play, but, Americans were used to the left and right arrows.Waste of money.Ray Carioscia"
1,Not Space Invaders,"Space Invaders was an old Atari Console game that I played in the early 1980s. I always wanted to have it on a PC micro computer in its original form like it was on the console.I ordered it through Amazon. Other games besides Space Invaders arrived, because I was sent two of the same disk numbers and one of the disks was missing.I sent an email to the dealer. The dealer told me that he was on a trip and would send me the missing disk soon. He was indefinite about when it would arrive. Several weeks have gone by. I have not received the missing disk."
5,A JAZZ CLASSIC,"THIS IS ONE OF THE 3 OR 4 ALBUMS THAT EMERGED DURING THE MID 1960'S THAT SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CHANGE THE WHOLE COURSE OF JAZZ.IT HELPED TO TRANSFORM JAZZ FROM THE MAINLY BOP, SWING FORMAT,AND TOOK INTO ANOTHER DIRECTION.FOR EXAMPLE, THE PIECE CALLED-MAIDEN VOYAGE COULD AND HAS BEEN PLAYED ON SMOOTHE JAZZ RADIOSTATIONS TO THIS VERY DAY AND COULD STILL HANG WITH THE LIKES OF DAVE KOZE,SANBORNE,AND MANY, MANY MORE OF TODAYS ARTISTS."
5,Another.........must have !,"Just as ""In a Silent Way"" is the corner stone of any 1965 to 1975 collection, this is right along side it. It too should never be broken up in pieces. A lot of recording era. was ""sit down"", are you ready, lets take off and create. No overdubbing or retakes. This remastered version is sensational. Nothing is lost or no filler added. This not peanut butter, and jelly, it is caviar. Listen to it enough, and it becomes beluga caviar. It will never be duplicated. Buy it, listen to it through head phones and treasure Mr. Hancock way before he went MTV with ""Rockit"""
3,Excellent album - poor recent vinyl pressings!,"I purchased this Maiden Voyage Vinyl + CD which sounds like a geat deal, but when I listened to the vinyl after the first time, I found myself listening exclusively to the CD: that's not good. I have an excellent turntable, and I ended up selling my Vinyl (only played twice) for 5 bucks! Then I bought the pressing before (I believe it was 2004), new again from a retail store and it was even worse! I think if you can find the 1985 pressing of this record, you will be much happier with it. It really sucks when you buy a new pressing, never before played, that sounds worse than an album that is 27 years old and has been played plenty of times.Fortunately, the record store gave me a full refund on my second purchase.Please discern any new pressing you buy, and if it doesn't meet your standards, return it. Don't allow these Mega corporations to produce crappy reproductions.Peter Lorenz ArtleMusicologist and record collector"
2,Disappointing Remaster,"I looked forward to this new release from Analog Productions. I had every reason to be enthusiastic after hearing Freddie Hubbard on Hubtones, Dexter Gordon on Go, and Lee Morgan on Sidewinder, all SACDs from Analog Productions. However, for some reason, Maiden Voyage just doesn't sound right. It is so very dark sounding. I compared it to my RVG edition CD. On the Analog Productions SACD, it sounds like the top end has been rolled off. I wish I could recommend Maiden Voyage but sadly, I cannot. Take my advice and stick with the RVG edition of this one."
4,Set sail on this modal outing,"This is the perfect introductory album for anyone who knows Herbie Hancock as only a light-funk/fusion player. On this album, arguably the best in his career, Hancock demonstrates what he was learning while working in Miles Davis' group, and even expands on those ideas. Freddie Hubbard, at the top of his game, sits in for Miles, and the remainder of Miles' group sound looser as a result. But this is Hancock's show and he contributes four of the five tunes, including two jazz standards- the beautiful ""Dolphin Dance"" and the atmospheric title track. Equally impresive is the quiet tension displayed on ""Eye of the Hurricane."" Sit back and enjoy the cruise."
3,Great Debut Cool Jazz Album but Needs Remastering!,"This is a wonderful debut for Herbie and clearly shows the influence of Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" as well as provides hints of ""Bitches Brew"" in a couple of tracks as well i.e. modal work plus hints of the avant-garde. Freddie Hubbard does some great work here and so does Coleman on sax with Herbie expertly supporting on piano. The first and last tracks are the strongest although there really isn't a weak track here. However, this version, unlike the clearly inaccurate product description, is not the Japanese mini-lp sleeve remastered version and hence could use this very treatment. My recommendation is to get the remastered version of this worthy addition to any jazz lover's cd collection."
4,An updated version or new edition is needed...,"This book is great and should be part of your CFS library. However, it was published in 1998, a new edition needs to come with upated information. There is plenty of revised and new information that has occured with CFS in the last 7 years."
4,Useful reference,"Erica Verillo presents here a comprehensive, authoritative and exhaustive review of chronic fatigue syndrome/ME. It begins with a history of the acceptance of this condition as a syndrome, the difficulties of both defining and diagnosing it. It explores the frequent co-morbidities of the syndrome: many sufferers are managing other conditions, both physical and mental, along with their chronic fatigue. It sets out a wide range of treatment options, from medical management of the condition to alternative therapies.It is not a book to read through in a sitting, and certainly not a book most sufferers of chronic fatigue are likely to read every word of. It's an encyclopedic reference book, and is best used in this way by dipping into the information about a particular issue or treatment covered in the book.A member of my family and a friend have this diagnosis: this book improved my understanding of their condition and will help me encourage them to pursue appropriate treatments."
1,I couldn't finish it,This book was too long and I just got tired of it all after awhile. Where is it going? What can it do for me? Why am I reading this? I just got so exhausted with it that I had to give up. It's 400 pages after all -- 400! Talk about fatigue!
2,Not for use in public school!,"As a public school teacher in Massachusetts, I find this book almost unusable. I make use of it only as outside-class reinforcement for Spanish speakers in my classes who need to acquire ONLY basic speaking skills quickly. Keep in mind, however, that the Spanish/English version contributes to a dependence on the student's first language, and its format & layout can be confusing. There aren't enough practice exercises in general, and it doesn't address any academic skills such as punctuation, capitalization, writing longer sentences/paragraphs or reading comprehension. Its saving grace is the pre-laminated reference sheet for common vocabulary and phrases. It would benefit from an accompanying CD or tape for speaking practice and reinforcement at the very least. Take care before you buy."
5,Fun girlie music,"I love this cd. If you are looking to get a lighthearted, upbeat girlie bubble gum rock CD, then you are in luck. If you like the movie, then the soundtrack is a good investment. I use the songs for silly dance parties with my roommates."
5,Great Buy!,"Whoever said the song 'Connected' was a remake of RBD's Tenetre Y Querete, you so need a reality check! Hello? Earth to that person! Connected is so not a copy of RBD!Connected is the best song on this album! I mean if you're that type of person who hates bubblegum, stay away from this! But if not, you should really give this CD a try. I would reccomend Connected, Can't Behave and Island in the Sun! Watch the movie first. It's more meaningful that way. 'Cos at first I didn't like Island in the Sun but after I watched the movie, WOW! I fell in love with that song. I love this album! Check out the movie too!"
1,Island In The Sun,The degrading of music continues Island in the Sun is a pathetic cover of the great Original Song by Weezer. If you have not heard it you should. Once again the lure of pre teens and cash far out weighs any artist creativity.
1,okay,"I like all of the songs especially ""Gentleman"" by Teddy Geiger. What I can't stand is how Sara Paxton is using a song thats veryyyyyyy similar to ""Tenerte Y Quererte"" by RBD. I feel like its a rip off, so i strongly dislike Connected."
4,ionic pro,"I purhased this from Wall Mart for $143. It's whisper quiet - even on ""high"". However, there seems to be a faint smell of bleach instead of the fresh air I expected. I purchased it based on ease of cleaning & square footage covered (500) & moderate pricing."
5,You gotta love the finished product even more,"When you hear these unfinished or alternate mix versions, it makes you appreciate the final versions we all know and love."
3,REAL LOVE,"Well, I personaly think that if anybody has the right to go back and get old Lennon demo tapes and use them to make good songs it would definatly be Paul, George and Ringo. I mean just listen to ""Free As A Bird"" and ""Real Love""--they're great. I'm just sad that they didn't remake ""Grow Old With Me"" for 'Anthology 3' like they were suppose to."
4,You get what you pay for.,"I'm a average golfer. Tried a friends quality 460cc driver. Wanted to purchase a big head, however, did not want to spend 300.00. The Hippo performs well, but not like a quality driver. You get what you pay for. Probably a good buy for a starter golfer."
2,Tiny DVD player,"Loved the size & I was very happy with it at the begining, but it started falling apart very soon. Not as sturdy or well made as the larger size DVDs. Not worth buying."
5,Amplifies Theosophic Tenets Admirably!,"Jinarajadasa dedicated his entire lifetime to ""the work"" and this 500 page plus tome is a monument to his dedication and ability to share these important principles with us. A masterpiece of Theosophic philosophy!"
3,I was hoping for more...,"I saw Horton perform with Ben Allison and was quite impressed with his chops and interpretative ability. That came as little surprse since I had felt the same way upon hearing Horton in a sideman capacity on a number of titles by Allison and others.While this disc is not without some very nice moments, too much of it sounds stiff and ""through-composed."" I enjoy ""high-art"" in my music as part of the experience- not high-art just for the sake of it and after my initial listen that is what I came away feeling. Even after shelving this title and revisiting it I just can get entirely past its repertory feel.So all-in-all this is not a bad title, it just didn't live up to my pre-disc expectations. And you know what they say, ""expectations are the building blocks of disappointment."""
3,"Interesting, but unpolished","I'm not entirely sure what to make of this album. Ellington's compositions are brilliant as always, and his playing is deliciously tasteful while managing at the same time to be intriguingly left of center. Max Roach's drumming is powerful and funky, proving once again that nobody swings harder.The one that really disappointed me was Mingus, which is tragic because he is among my absolute favorite musicians. His tone is harsh and trebly, which isn't helped by the odd riffs and fills he plays that sound more like rasping sound effects than a harmonic foundation.The whole recording just sounds slightly off. The rhythms never lock up. The improvisations go to interesting places, but they do so without the professionalism that should be expected of such top-notch performers."
5,Brilliant!,"Money Jungle is one of the most important albums of all time. It is extremely underrated and should get the respect it deserves. This album blends three of the best jazz artists of all time. Max Roach, who is one of the most important jazz drummers of all time, only rivaled by Art Blakey and Chick Webb. Charles Mingus, who is easily the best, most important and most influential bass player of all time. And finally, Duke Ellington, the most important American composer of the 20th century and one of the most brilliant piano players. When these three talents are mixed, the ultimate piano trio is reached. Together, they record 11 of Ellington's most brilliantly arranged compostions, resulting in an incredible album. All of the songs are brilliant, it would not even be worth it to mention individual songs. Money Jungle should be listened to by anybody who is interested in music."
1,Waste of money if you already own released seasons,"This DVD was a waste of money because it only contained episodes already released on the Season 1-4 DVDs. I bought it for my daughter expecting episodes from the entire series (ie ones she hasn't already seen), but every episode is already on another DVD that she has. Don't repackage something and sell it as new."
2,One of the worst... skip it,"Well, if you already had all other Seven Hassel's books and only takes this one to read them all, then go for it, it won't hurt.But be advised: this is his worst book (along with ""The Commissar""). Totally cheap and unimaginative."
5,Buy This Book!,"A fun read! Written with a sense of humor and nicely illustrated, I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in kid's reading material that's not pandering or sugar-coated. Get it!"
1,Dont Buy it!,This book starts out really cute. The little girl see's the sea. Then it takes a terrible turn she gets bit by a jellyfish. Now she hates the sea and wants to go home! Why on earth would you right a book soo scary to young kids! Dont waste your money you can find something better
3,interesting,"In a world that craves novelty, Sugar Blue was that new flavor that caught the public's fancy. When controlled by outside forces, such as the Stones on 'Miss you', his chops can be fit into a musical form. On his own, SB seems more interested in dominating the instrument than making sure the music coming out of it is good. When did 'Miss you' come out, 1978?"
2,Mediocre compared to the live thing,"I picked this album up after witnessing one of Sugar Blue's performances at Legend's. Expecting the same tense, heart-about-to-break blues I experienced at his show, I was disappointed to find that he carried none of his spirit into the studio with him. Sure, his skill is still there, but something was just missing. If you've seen him live on a good night, you'll know what I mean."
3,good herbal guide for pregnancy,"This is more of a handbook than an instructional book that provides good herbal remedies for different pregnancy maladies, as well as herbal remedies for fertility, birth, post-natal, and baby."
4,Caribbean Mystique Aplenty,"I am not ordinarily a reader of 'romantic mysteries'; however,I do like mysteries, and I'm under the tropical spell of St. Lucia. This is a very good read, with an intriguing plot, and interesting characters. But the Island itself and its colonial, Afro-Caribbean heritage, are the main focus here. Believe me, everyone in St. Lucia ends up talking to the birds. Read it. You won't want to put it down."
4,Good Read,"A Dream Across Time By Annie Roger is a novel, set in the exotic beauty of St. Lucia, will make you wonder about mystical possibilities of reincarnation and generational collective memory. The simple story carries you to the end because of the delightful character Jamie and her love, Andre. Their chance meeting, their struggles with their own personal lives, their ultimate destiny to be together unfold in a series of simple events prompting the folklore of the island's secret history to be revealed by the keepers of the ancient secrets. The book is fanciful and light reading and an entertaining escape read, especially if you are a female going to an exotic island, especially in the Caribbean. You never know what awaits you!"
5,Meetings with Remarkable Men,"This is an easy to read introduction to the complex work of George Gurdjieff, perhaps more of an adventure story than a fair depiction of this man's many contributions. I'd recommend it for fairly young readers, as well as to those who simply want to know more about Gurdjieff's early and middle life."
5,Perfect !!!,My book was received in short order --- and is in perfect condition. It's a title that is not easily found - so I was thrilled to see it from this vendor. It's a REMARKABLE piece of writing ---- I'm so glad to have it. Thank you!
3,There is a lot that can be learned from Gurdjieff,"Gurdieff is one of those men, who are hard to understand. They are hard to understand because they are different, they shun the very beliefs that are a part of our everyday living.While there were many instances where I thought ""what is he talking about?"", this book was a good read.If you are to read this book, I suggest that you read it like a fantasy travel journal."
1,Decide for yourself,"Does G.I. Gurdjieff have anything to offer you? Consider the following quote (which is not atypical) from p. 210 of Meetings with Remarkable Men:""In my opinion in employing contemporary maps it would be ideally useful to put into practice the sense of a judicious saying which declares, 'If you wish to succeed in anything then ask a woman for advice and do the opposite'."""
2,Caveat emptor - Unremarkable (all and everything.),"Lots of ""wiseacring"" here. Gurdjieff manages to prove himself a self-aggrandizing whack-job whose philosophy is stolen from Socrates. Socrates boiled down it down to ""The unexamined life is not worth living"" - Such a pity Mr. G was never so pithy."
3,Limited Road Atlas,"It is complete in that it covers the Northwest, but the detail in rural areas is poor once you get outside of the cities."
3,The Harpur Family,"This one gets close to home; in the first line of the book, Colin Harpur?s wife is being murdered. The book continues by dealing with this death. Part is the interaction of Harpur with his two teenage daughters. The other part brings us the actions and thoughts his wife had on her last day. Only in the second part does the story start to take off, ending strongly with improbable happenings to bring the perpetrators to justice.Compared to previous books in this series, it all feels like something the cat dragged in."
4,Almost Too Much Information,"Jesse Stoff describes a broad approach to the treatment of prostate cancer. In fact, it is the most comprehensive prescription for an alternative treatment of prostate cancer that I have ever encountered. The main ingredient emphasized is PC SPES but that is not viewed so much as a 'silver bullet' as it is a necessary part of a multi-faceted attack on the disease.Stoff writes from the perspective of one who personally treats prostate cancer patients in his medical practice. If this book has a weakness, it is that the reader is given so much information it may lead to some confusion."
2,"Follow-up To My Review Of September 15, 2001.","The authors describe a comprehensive approach to the treatment of prostate cancer. Much emphasis is placed on the importance of PC SPES as a necessary ingredient in a multi-faceted attack on the disease.Unfortunately the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned consumers last year to cease taking PC SPES because it contained undeclared prescription drug ingredients. The manufacturer of the product has since gone out of business.Although THE PROSTATE MIRACLE includes much useful information, the apparent demise of PC SPES seems to greatly diminish the usefulness of this book."
2,review,Old book ..2000 ..the suggested supplement PC SPES is pulled from the market !!I made a mistake to order this book..sorry
5,Great product,Searched the internet for a replacement heater for my bathroom This unit was a perfect replacement for my old heater. Word perfectly with easy installation.
1,Not the correct item described or pictured,"The Broan 157 has a SOLID heating element similar to what you would find in an older stove (with the big snake coils on the top.) The image depicted above is of the 154 model which is the one that has the chrome alloy coil (like what you find in cheaper floor fixtures.) The main difference between the two is that the 157 has to heat up longer than the 154. When you turn the 157 on it will have to warm up the coil for a few minutes before it puts out strong heat. When you turn on the 154 the heat will be produced much faster. The trade off to this is that the 157 has at least a 40 year life (we are just now replacing the one in our 42 year old home and it still works), whereas the 154 could burn up much sooner.I want the chrome alloy coil because of the faster heat output. Something to note before you make your purchase."
2,Utilitarian and Overpriced,"I returned this heater as soon as we opened it. It is quite utilitarian and not at all attractive. The uncoated, unpolished aluminum casing and mesh grill simply look cheap. I do appreciate the ease of return to Amazon - better than any other retailer."
3,Not so sure about this,"The Broan Model 157 was purchased to replace one that had been in the bathroom for about 45 years. Identical in looks to the original. It was properly installed with the correct 15 amp circuit, but has shut off several times, and blown the fuse. I am not sure why, but will continue to monitor the situation before returning for a different model. Therefore I cannot give a complete satisfactory report on the new heater."
1,It lasted ten minutes,"Installed the unit,everything worked fine.The next morning started it again.It quit ten minutes later.That was it.The replacement unit has lasted longer but its still to early to say how much longer.I have owned several of the Broan coil wire element units over the years.They are cheaper and lasted years."
3,What ever happened to quality??,I have replaced a 47 year old nutone 9290 with The broan 157. So far it works ok but definitely is louder.The quality of construction looks as if it were made to be installed in an outhouse. Another great china product!!
3,Bought for a homeschool Medieval Caste Unit,"My kids love this castle! Even my toddler likes to play with the knights and horses. It was great as a hands on fun manipulative to our medieval unit. The castle is made to break apart when hit, so it does fall apart easily. I just left it attached with the twist ties it came with so it would not fall apart while they are playing with it. The characters are a nice size. The helmets lift to reveal the knights faces. The weapons, sheilds and the way they are dresses were all great to go along with our study. The price was very reasonable compared to other items I looked at for this use. If for play or for educational purposes, I think this is a great product for the price. ~ A Homeschool Mom"
3,Too many little pieces,"My kids love this castle set, but I'm a little frustrated with it. There are too many tiny weapons and armor pieces, and the kids have already broken the door off. So on balance, it's good but not great."
2,When the boss is away--,"Miles' second ""great quintet"" sans Miles lacks cohesion, focus, purpose, at least on this outing. The ""compositions"" seem to be titles manufactured after the fact as a way of providing dividers to the free-form meanderings that took place while the tape was running. There are a few sparks created by Rivers and Shorter on the first couple of tracks, but the rest of the album is curiously unengaging. Peacock's unfaltering walking bass lines provide coherence and civility, but this would hardly seem to be the occasion for exercising politeness. And for a Van Gelder-engineered session, Williams' cymbals are surprisingly subdued in the total mix.If you're a musician, hearing a session like this makes you wish you were taking part in it. I'm more impressed by recordings that ""scare"" me back into the practice room."
1,the worst slipper i have ever bought,"after only one week use at home, the sole was completely broken. the worst quality slipper i have ever seen!"
4,PCI-E X800XL - Capable yet efficient,"Pros- Fast, Smooth, relatively low power consumption. (aprox 50w) Very capable for Video Editing and Gaming. New LOW Price.Cons- Not the latest and greatest. Not especially quiet fan or fan controller.I used this ATI-brand card for about a year in a video-editing system with great results. It provided a large performance improvement (for rendering) over an x600.I used an AC ATI silencer 5 aftermarket cooler on it for less noise and better cooling, though it required re-wiring to a separate power source as the on-card fan controller caused it to make a lot of clicking noises. (due to electrical ""noise""). Otherwise, the card performed flawlessly."
3,Should be 1000 x better,"So many talented artists & songs to pick from, so why doesn't this, Alligator's major Christmas showcase, blow me away? I don't like over produced tunes, but much of this is way under produced. If you're looking for a CD that you'll grow more fond of through each passing season, as I was, look elsewhere. Mind you, some of it might grow on you, as it has on me, and granted mine is just one opinion, but I sure don't hear any future classics on here... even though I should be able to, and from a mile away!"
5,This is awesome!!!!!,"I really like these oil pastels. They were a great bargain, but they're just like crayons! They are a bit better, but there's not much of a difference. Oil pastels are just wax crayons. Still, I think they're really good because they are much prettier than crayons for their brightness!"
2,Left me wanting a lot more!,"I wanted a great set of oil pastels to work with and this was not it. I promptly shifted to Sennelier and I think that was money well spent. My advice, when it comes to your oil pastel or any other art material, don't skimp. There are several artist grade pastels out there which are economical compared to the top end brands but provide their value in quality of your art. This site is a good start[...]"
1,Warranty? What warranty?,"I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable ""due to customer abuse."" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as ""customer abuse""), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works. After that, you're on your own."
5,great fit,These really fit well and the price was exceptionally good. I highly recommend these bike shorts.
2,Light and not very interesting,"Al went through a drastic change in his playing/writing when he went from the rocker Electric Rendezvous to this, his next studio release.The end result shows potential but overall just doesn't keep much interest and this is a very weak effort compared to his later works.Al did two more albums under the Manhattan label, but unfortunately neither of them are still in print (Cielo e Terra is better than this, and Tirami Su is the best of the three easily).Therefore, I'd recommend getting ""The Best of Al DiMeola"", which features more or less the best pieces from his 3 album stint with Manhattan... and interestingly enough, there is only 1 track out of 9 from here (Traces of a Tear comes from Cielo e Terra)."
5,Fixed my mixer cheaply,"I keep these little beauties on hand since I make a lot a bread with my mixer and have 3 daughters who are learning to make bread. My husband can change out a worm gear in under half an hour, but I have a hard time taking the mixer apart and putting it back together since it takes some amount of brute force, so it takes me about an hour (with a coffee break in the middle - lol). Still, a great little gear that's made to break to save the motor on my very well-used KitchenAid mixer."
5,"Worked as expected, good price",This gear is designed to fail (safety feature). The plastic will eventually wear out.This part is easy to replace if you watch the youtube video.Product was exactly what I expected and it fit perfectly. Good price
5,awesome,awesome keeps me on the end of the chair and happy to see people out there to stop drug dealers etc.
3,Border Wars?,"Border Wars? - drugs in every corner , not only in the border , in your city , don't look or will be the next.You don't need turn on your tv on the news to watch the war , because , war are here!Who kill more people in a day : drugs or a F18 ?"
5,When Calls the Heart,This book is wonderful to read. It takes you to a time that life was simpler.It encouraged me to live more for God.
4,Awrsome,It was very en lightning. It made me want to be right there with the characters. Think how they lived in those days. I loved it.
5,heartwarmer,"This is a beautiful story,wonderfully written. The characters are so real,I can't wait to read the next book in this series."
5,Great,Great rating. I would recomend this product to anyone. And I hope you enjoy it as much as i do.
5,Absolutely awesome.,"A snapshot in time that transports the lucky reader back to the late 1890's. Typical good read by One. Her books always feed your spirit without preaching at you. Her characters are relatable, loveable, and engaging."
4,Sweet,"This is a sweet romance. It ended a little abruptly for my taste, but it was sweetheart and sweet nonetheless."
4,like,Sometimes you just want a book to read. Not one that teaches you anything just one to enjoy. This book does that for you
3,Sweet book,"I read these books many many years ago when I was in jr/high school. I loved them and Janette Oke inspired me to become the avid reader I am today. I was so excited to see my favorite Janette Oke book 1 of the Canadian West Series on Kindle and FREE! I was somewhat saddened that I didn't like it as much as I did a long long time ago. Maybe because I've grown older? It was still a wonderfully sweet book, and Wynn and Beth will always hold a special place in my heart."
3,good book but could be better,liked the story and beth but this would have been a better read if the love story was deleoped more. The book often felt like a quick explaination of what happened instead of a well thought out and developed narative. The love portion of the story started late and then the book was over. the beggining of the book was slow. overall however it was a unique read.
2,I could not get into this book,I was very bored with this book from the beginning. Perhaps it was the setting or the slow pace. I couldn't identify with the characters or their feelings. Just overall not a book I would recommend.
5,Great Book,I read the whole series and I couldn't put this book down. The series flows well. You will enjoy these book.
3,"Such a disappointing ending, ruined a great book","I was happily engrossed in the book, enjoying it, when to my surprise I realized that it was 85% done and the romance between the two main characters had not even really started yet! The author did not develop the romance at all, just threw the two characters together at the last page and ended the book. The end was so rushed, it just ruined the entire story. Such a shame, because it was a great book otherwise."
3,It's hard to take the characters seriously,"This had the potential to be a good book, but the main character was not believable. I found her to be a prissy, goody-two shoes that annoyed me throughout most of the story. The plot and relationships development was also weak, and at the end of the book I was asking myself ""that's the ending?!"" I gave this book 3 stars because it wasn't terrible even though it was somewhat disappointing."
4,When Calls the Heart(Canadian West Book #1),Enjoyed the book very much. Going to read another one of her books. (Canadian West Book #2) A must read.
5,When Calls the Heart/ 5 Stars,FIVE Stars! Solid Christian values woven into an intriguing romance story. I would say a good read for ages 14 and up.
3,Predictable - not much of a story,It was ok. I read it in a day so it's a fast read. I wouldn't read it again though. It was just the standard story. Got bored with it but still wanted to finish it so I did.
5,Great book,"I have read all of the books in this series more than once, and I highly recommend the whole series to anyone who enjoys a good book with real life circumstances surrounding the characters. This book is well written with some action and unexpected turns."
5,Good read,This is a touching romance. I think it would be enjoyed by many no matter what age you are. Can't wait for the next one.
5,enjoyment,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had all the things I personally look for when I sit down to relax with a good book. Most of all a nice clean read, with a bit of romance without ""pages ""of unending sex. Humor which I feel is always important. Information about the area the story takes place. Also, importantly, the importance of God in our lives. Thank you for including this book in your selections."
5,great book,This was a nice relaxing easy reading book and has a nice interesting story that hadMe following the LOVE COMES SOFTLY series. Its nice to have a little history in it too about life in the olden days.
2,a little dull,"I found myself skimming a lot. There were only mere moments that were good. The lead male wasn't even introduced until 1/3 of the book, probably later. There were hardly any interactions except towards the end. It was just a disappointment coming from Janette Oke."
4,Sweet,"This is a gentle love story, not just about romantic love but about a frontier school teacher's love for her new home and her new students.It's a bit too heart-warming to be realistic. There aren't really any bad guys, and religion plays a big enough role that it might annoy you if you're not religious at all. However, it's one of those great (and rare) clean romances.The historical details are interesting and the writing style is smooth. I would read more by her."
4,good reading,"When Calls the Heart is a wholesome, well-crafted tale about a young woman who courageously goes into the Canadian wilderness to teach school. In the process of adjusting to a new culture, she becomes the student. The story is full of good humor and is easy to read."
4,When Calls the Heart (Canadian West Book #1),"This novel was very well written and interesting because of it's hitorical nature. I especially appreciate books that aren't centered around sexual encounters and swearing. It's refreshing to read a great book, with a well developed story and entertaining."
3,ok,This book was ok...good plot poor execution??!! Would I buy it definitely not. Not what I usualy read but was ok.
2,Lacks depth.,"""When Calls the Heart"" had absolutely no depth whatsoever. The character's were one dimensional and predictable. But, thankfully, there was hardly any religious preaching, which I was thankful for. The chapters were very short, and were written as if they were from a child, with no meaning. And, as always, the ending came up so quickly, and ends so abruptly. If you're looking for a mindless read, then this is for you. If not, then I do not recommend."
5,Great books,"These are a wonderful addition to any library. It is a pleasure to read good ""CHRISTIAN"" novels that contain Morals and I would strongly suggest our teenage daughters being exposed to this type of romance verses all the vulgar, graphic writings in today's world. There is still PLEASURE in a wholesome loving God given relations and our teens today need to realize that."
5,Surprisingly enjoyable,"I say surprisingly because it was not what I expected. I had never read anything from Janette Oke, but this book made me a fan. It was romantic but not steamy. I really enjoy bits of Christianity thrown in there too. Even though I had to wait a while for the love interest to be exposed, the story had so much more to it that I didn't feel like I was missing anything. I look forward to enjoying more of her books."
3,Wholesome and Good,"Nice girl ends up with the good guy. Not a lot of in depth relationships or character. But a lot of great moral character and faith in God, not often found."
4,LOVE IT!,I can't imagine teaching school in rural areas. I have daughters that are teachers. They might survive that kind of teaching. Geat job describing everything.
3,Cute story,"Nice, easy read. Predictable but a nice story and a wholesome view on romance. Leaves you wanting to know more about the characters."
4,Great,It was a very entertaining book. it told a very delightful story .I am ready to read the next one!
4,The world as my grandmother knew it,"A fun read. Kept looking for opportunities to read a little more. Growing up along the more remote segments of the US and Canadian border I found many familiar and believable life situations and neighbors illustrated in this book. As shared in the book, the journey of growth and development of self reliance that comes with being alone in a ""wilderness"" can be amazing."
5,Fabulous,"I have always loved Janette One! I have read ""The Love Comes Softly"" series and couldn't put the book down! This series is no different!"
3,A good read.,"Loved the book. A very good description of someone in a new culture, and all the things that you don't understand and how to overcome them,with a love story and life thrown in for good measure."
4,I love this type of story.,This is the type of story that I love to read.Women in pioneer days. Sometimes on their own.Highly recommend this boodk.
3,Great,Very nice..will continue to read more books and let friends and family know to read because it was nice reading.
4,Love Janette Oke's books,This book was a wonderful story. Just wish the wedding had been included. Looking forward to the next book in this series.
3,Good but annoying at times,"A good book from about half way but before that really frustrating. You wait almost to half way to have any interaction between Elizabeth and Wynn and all that was before seems trifle and frustrating. The best part of the book is Wynn. His character is strong, godly and really an inspiration. Elizabeth annoyed me at times and the second half of the story ploughed through too fast for adequate development between Elizabeth and Wynn. Wynn saved this book for me and that's the only reason I'll continue to read the next one in the series."
5,When Calls the Heart - Canadian West Book @1,"I have read all the the Love Comes Softly books and now am reading the Canadian West Books. I particularly enjoy the story lines, the way Janette weaves in the beauty of Canada and the West, the references to the Bible and the many spiritual references and the faith of the characters."
4,Timeless read,"One thing I enjoy about reading historical fiction is that the story is timeless. I read this book for the first time several years ago. I had forgotten the details, but remembered how it ended. However, that didn't thwart my enthusiasm to finish the book. I have read several books by Janette Oke and enjoy them all. This book was no exception."
4,Slow start but worth the finish,I had trouble getting into the book at first. But it's an endearing book and had a wonderful finish. Worth the read. Now on to my next Janette Oke book. :)
4,Excellent,"I loved this story. It had success, tragedy, suspense, romance, all rolled into one. Written in such a way that I couldn't put it down. The only drawback I had was the detailed intimacy that goes against my moral values. That could have been eliminated and still been a great story."
4,Great read,I loved the story; reminded me of an elderly aunt who taught school in Colorado in about 1910. She lived with a local family and rode her horse to get to the schoolhouse. Well written and entertaining.
4,Canadian West #1,This was the first book by Janette Oke that I have read but I have seen pretty much all of the movies made from her Love Comes Softly series and loved all of them. This book was a very easy read and a good storyline. I will buy more of the series and hope to buy other series by her.
5,Most Wonderful Book Ever!,"If I could, I would give this more than five stars, but since that wansn't an option, I picked the top rating. This is most definitely my favorte book and if you haven't read it yet, you absolutely HAVE to. It's wonderful, as well as all of Janette Oke's other books. I repeat- READ THIS BOOK!"
3,good story,The characters are good but I feel there is not enough conflict. I want to read the other books .
5,When calls the heart.,I really enjoyed this book the era it was written in and land in which the words painted such a beautiful picture. The storyline was one of charm and family love great story for us who love a good love story.
2,Yawn ho hum,This book is so predictable it was almost a sleeping pill. I'm sure I won't be buying book #2 in the series.
2,A long read,"The plot of this book was good, but I didn't like the first person style. I just finished a wonderful series of books that were all written in first person so I was expecting a great read. I was disappointed in the style of first person with this book. I felt like I was bouncing between a journal, a narrative, the present, and the past. I liked the story, but it was a slow read for me."
4,When Calls the Heart (Canadian West Book #1),Good read. Kept me interested and wanting to keep reading. The setting was tranquil and the way the main character delt with the wilderness and the challenges it presented was entertaining.
4,Enjoyable,"I had not read a Janette Oke book, but I will definitely read another one and another one. So rich and pure..."
1,what's with the price?!?!,"The one star isn't for the product, it's for the price. I've been using the Melitta Coffee Javapods for over a year now and I LOVE them. However, I usually buy an 18-ct box for under $5. Where did $15 come from?!"
1,Black Mold Health Risk,"I bought this pillow 9 months ago from my chiropractor. I did not notice a slow leak or any water at all draining from the reservoir. This past week, I noticed a strange odor. Then came a sore throat and cough. I looked under the pillow case to find a small area of black spots, but enough to cause a strong odor and health hazard. To make matters worse, my pregnant wife would use the pillow after I left for work! Don't risk it."
2,Loved the Pillow...until the mold Beware,"I loved this pillow. It did last me a couple of years. Last week I noticed that I was coughing and had what I felt was a chest cold or slight bronchitis. It didn't get better. One night I noticed that the bed was wet under the pillow. When I took off the case and the pillow protector I was greeted with a pillow with a lot of black mold on the bottom. It had apparetnly been leaking slowly enough that I didnt notice it, but allowed Mold to grow. Disgusting. I don't know that I will trust this pillow again. I went out and bought a down pillow. I might buy one again, but I will beware."
2,chiroflow leak fungus,"We purchase 2 chiroflow pillows based on personal testimonies from the chiro office our daughter is employed with. They are very comfortable.After a few weeks we started to smell an odor we could not identify, but it was coming from the pillow. After further inspection we saw the dreaded black spots...fungus. Obviously they were leaking, both pillows were in the mix.We will have to go back to form fit,can't gamble with breathing something like that in all night."
2,Neck pain pillow,"Well, i got this on the advice of my chiropractor. I usually use a feather pillow. I still do. For me, sleeping on this pillow was just like having a synthetic one and it was just too bulky to me. i took alot of water out to where it hardly has any. I use it as a leg pillow, works fine for that! Sorry not for me!"
2,Returned Mine,"I tried it, I didn't like it. I see that some people have now commented on something I didn't like about it, which is how heavy it is once it's filled; but I didn't see such comments when I bought mine, a few months ago. In addition, I really didn't find it to be any more comfortable than any other pillows I've used. I tried varying the amount of water in it and it never did seem thick enough. One other thing, I guess my mattress tapers-off a bit around the edges, and due to that, it seemed like the water in the pillow wanted to flow to the outside, upper edge of the pillow, away from my neck and shoulder, which obviously defeats the purpose. Anyway, these were some things I didn't consider before buying the pillow. On a positive note, I had no trouble returning it and getting a refund. I think I bought mine directly from Amazon.com."
3,A little difficult to get set up,"The product arrived very fast considering it was right before Christmas when I placed the order. I followed the directions step by step. I used the recommended amount and found that it was not enough. The problem I had during set up was getting the air out (I guess.) The directions state that if you get the air out then you ""should not"" hear water sloshing around when you move the pillow. Well, I heard it loud and clear. I opted to add more water for firmness and I really tried everything to get ALL the air out before sealing. FAIL! The water sloshes around even more now. I love the pillow, it is very comfortable but the water moving around makes a horrible noise when your ear is pressed right against it at night."
1,Mediflow Fiber Waterbase Pillow,The idea of the pillow is great but it is too fat for my neck and puts it at an uncomfortable angle. I tried it without the water and it was too fat before I ever put water in it.
5,Water Pillow,"The description for the 'Chiroflow Water Pillow' is detailed and accurate. The instructions and recommendation on how and how much water to fill the pillow with are very easy to follow.... since I am using this pillow, I don't have shoulder aches anymore!"
3,An Important Compendium,"The medieval, mythological and folklore historian has been waiting a long time for a book like this. Have you ever read a little bit of medieval story or folklore and wondered exactly what its origin was, whether it was Irish, Welsh or English, Scandinavian or Eastern European? This compendium has all this in a Norton anthology font-size that is simply jam-packed with details and information. In encyclopedic form, it is a necessary reference tool for any historian, as well a compelling read for anyone interested in the subject matter. It's all here in one concise book that deserve a place on any shelf; fortunately it doesn't take up too much space!Originally published on March 17th, 2003.Go to BookBanter ([...] for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
1,pinnacale SUX!,"the Pinnacle studio quick start software will not launch. I stayed on the ""preparing to install..."" box for 13 hours and it never loaded. I did it 3 times I even asked someone else to check it just in case I was doing something wrong. the same thing happen to them.I'm not happy with this product the only good thing about this is I only paid a few bucks with your company."
4,Awesome,"I don't understand why many Madonna fans don't like this song or the Humpty remixes. First off, the humpty mixes are WAY better than the Calderone mixes. The Humpty Radio mixes adds more of a dance beat to the song, while the Humpty visits Madonna mix is a kind of dub mix with very minimal vocals. All of Calderone's mixes sound the same and they [stink]!"
2,Like the original in title only,"And I'm not just talking about the sound - Madonna dropped about 40% of the original lyrics. How can you call that the same song?While I like her version, it really doesn't hold a candle to the original."
1,"0,0,0,0 stars","I can not believe out of the 8 reviews, only 2 people hate it. Madonna is a killer. Just like in, ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina,"" she takes a classic and butchers it. Don McLean is the only one who can sing this song. Madonna takes the song, and you can barely even recognize it. ""INCREDIBLE"" the first review says. Well, whoever wrote that needs a lesson in good music. I am really mad that Madonna has once again shown such evilness as to destroy a great song."
1,This is truly the day the music died.,"Hello all. I listened to the Madonna cover of American Pie but twice. Don Mclean, I'm sorry. Buddy Holly, I'm sorry. Madonna turned this beautiful song into a pop atrocity. Every time one of those notes is played, I scream in pain. Now, listen up for all of you who notice why this song has such high ratings here. Traditionally, the only people who rate songs are those who loved it so much, they want to share their love with the rest of the world. You can prove my example by searching for almost anything. Now, i also want to show you something else. Ignoring the two latest one star reviews, take a good look at which reviews were chosen most useful. With the two one-star reviews, one of them was found useful by one out of fifteen people and the other was found useful by only three out of eighteen people. Don't believe everything you read. LED ZEPPLIN RULES. By the way, Britney SPears is doing a cover of Satisfaction by the Rolling Stones. Beware."
1,Artistically bereft and morally reprehensible...,"To turn an all-time rock standard into a piece of disco-style fluff is just like Madonna. Even though I was never a big fan of the song (yes I know the significance of the song and its reference to Buddy Holly's plane crash) I still consider it a rock classic (along with Stairway to Heaven and Free Bird, neither of which are favorites of mine). At least Don McLean put some feeling and heart into the song - Madonna sings it in the mechanical style which has been her norm in recent years. I listened to it on the radio once - now, my finger moves to the preset buttons on my car radio at just short of the speed of sound the second it comes on."
5,good job madonna,"madonna has taken a classic rock song and reinvented it as her own. having removed the verses about buddy holly and early rock, she has recorded a song that is at once brilliant and poignant. madonna's vocals have never been better and i applaud her bravado for even attempting to ""remake"" this song. American Pie has become a classic in both incarnations."
3,Only worth the Victor remix...,"The only reason this single is worth getting is for the Victor Calderone vocal mix. This was the mix played in clubs, and is well done. The single was not released domestically, which was a disappointment. The track is incredible. It's amazing what she did with this song. Unfortunately, the CD-single is not too great. Maybe an unreleased track would have been a good idea for inclusion on the CD."
5,THE FULL REMIXES!,"i have to order at amazon the remixes of american pie. the cd single features two long versions not available in the original release! the 10.34 version is the best. it includes the vocals and the instruments. thisd is the real remix! the other tracks are okay. it also featured a shorter intro with the 9.33 version, the vission remix 5.45, the single remix 4.28 and single version 4.33.not to be missed by hardcore madonna fans..."
3,"good song, but...","..this tracklisting is awful. The 2 Calderone dubs are like 98% identical. How boring. Anyway, it's worth it just for the lp version, but if you wnat some nice mixes, get the one that has the Vission versions or the Japanese import."
1,Boring - A waste of money,The first version was ok not her best work. The next two versions of the song there is no singing at all. If you want to actually hear the song wait until it is released on her next album.
5,A REAL bargain!,"Right,get this: The groovy album version of this track plus the airplay fave and catchy Humpty Radio Mix Plus a swinging dub version with Madonna chanting ""the music,music,the music.."" PLUS the 2 brilliant Calderone Vocal mixes that use the same terrific beats as his previously-released Dub versions,but now all the vocals are featured so you can sing along ""Did you write the book of love and do you have faith in God above.."" etc etc while you dance.. ..And all that on ONE CD.If you haven't already bought ""American Pie"",THIS is the CD-maxi to choose! Happy dancing!"
3,Miss American Pie,"Why they had ""Humpty"" remix this song is way beyond me-his radio remix is..well bad. It removes the charm that makes the song so great. And the other Humpty mix is just a dub. Now the Calderone mix...so good! I love his work and he really did a great job. It sounds similiar to the dubs(wah wah) big deal. He always gets me going and doesn't make the mixes pop(a la Whitney Houston's latest batch of singles). So if you like the song buy ""The Next Best Thing"" soundtrack, the album cut is still the best, and if you love Madonna buy this-it is so red hot."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Clever. First these mixes were unavailable except as DJ promos...allegedly because Madonna did not like the vocals. She was right. These mixes are disappointing at best...with the vocals lifted pretty much intact off the album version and dropped in the middle of the otherwise ordinary dub mix. Lots of potential here, but it doesn't deliver. Only for Madonna fans who *must* have everything."
4,"Great Product, Great Price","Living in rural Maine, about the only place around here to get a hand mixer is WalMart. I was very unimpressed with the quality of the mixers that our store carried. I bought my last mixer there, and it didn't last a year. I have other Sunbeam products--an iron, a breadmaker--and have been pleased with their performance. I read a lot of the reviews here on Amazon before ordering my mixer. I agree with what most people say about it. It was well worth the price. It is a nice handling mixer, has good balance, and doesn't feel cheap. It has plenty of power to do anything that I need it for. I don't think I've even used the highest setting yet. The biggest test for any mixer I use is a big batch of chocolate chip cookies. This will work one up with ease. The only reason I hesitate to give it a five star rating is the fact that I haven't had it for a long time yet. If it lasts, it will be worth a 5."
2,too fast,This mixer is very frustrating to use. As other reviews noted the lowest speed is just too fast. Go with a kitchenaid!
2,There is no low speed!,"I give this 2 stars, but that is for looks and durability ONLY. It sure is pretty and it sure is strong. But...The lowest setting is far too fast! We got this for a wedding shower gift and I absolutely hate it. There is no way to slow it down. Not only is it too fast, but there is barely any change between the lowest speed and the highest speed. Honestly, don't waste your money on this. Go with something else entirely. I'm buying a new one this weekend."
2,Not a good choice,"Where do I begin. I've lived with it for a year, and I'm moving on. There is no slow speed - so get ready to clean. No matter how deep the bowl you use, the batter will fly. The stand is a good idea, but in reality, rolling the cord under the stand is a hassle each and every time. And finally, the blades. They are nearly impossible to release. It takes monumental effort and actually hurts my fingers. My friend was my helper in the kitchen at Thanksgiving, and she too couldn't believe how difficult the release was. It mixes great! But there will be a mess, a hassle, and sore fingers."
1,So many things wrong with this mixer,"I'll admit, I bought this mixer because I liked the look. Never again will I make that mistake.#1 Like other reviews have mentioned, there is no slow speed. There are only very slightly varying degrees of high.#2 The button for releasing the beaters is AWFUL. For one thing, it is VERY hard to push in and hurts my thumb every time and if you forgot to unplug the mixer you end up turning it back on because it is much easier for the lever to slip upwards than it is to get it pushed in.I'm also not a fan of the display stand because it takes more time than I would like to coil the cord & get it to stay underneath, but that part is my fault for not realizing that it wasn't a retractable cord.All in all I have wanted to replace this mixer since the first time I used it and have been attempting to rationalize buying a new one even though it's only a year old and my last one lasted me 15 years."
4,good deal,"works well, better than other pumps i have used. priced right.blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,blah, blah, blah, blah"
4,Sump pump,Was easy to install and conect. Has multiple settings to set the tethered float distance if you have a smaller bucket to set the sump in. Very fast ejection of water.
4,Used for lake runoff,Given that I have only had it in use for a week it is working fine if it last 5-10 yrs I would give it 5 stars the last one lasted 20 yrs
2,Sorry..but they're no Pentangle,"I've tried very hard with this album since its release, but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here. The incredible string band, pentangle, Bread, love and dreams comparisons are, in my opion, wishful thinking. This isn't due to Espers ability as song writers, but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere. This ruins what is otherwise a nice album."
3,Good but only 30 mins,Good tips - ended abruptly after 30 mins or so...No wonder I couldn't find out how long it was before I purchased...So yes content good - but paying too much for such a short video...Shape-up Bennett Marine Video!-Joe
5,AMAZING,"If you like movies, you'll like this. If you enjoy foreign movies, you'll LOVE this.I watched this movie in theaters back in 02 or 03.. and it is still by far one of the best movies (not just foreign movies) I have ever seen. It has love, betrayel, corruption, religion, and many other subjects that just make this movie complete. I won't get into details.. you can read the plot summary yourself.Buy it, rent it, netflix it, whatever. Everyone should watch this movie. It really is an incredible experience from beginning to end."
2,amateurish,"After being pleased with ""Motorcycle Diaries"", I thought I would check out more of Gael Garcia Bernal's work. This movie was a huge disappointment. It was so amateurish that the darker aspects seemed silly, and the ending that could have been poignantly tragic, seemed sordid and pointless. As a practing Catholic myself, I was curious to see what the Mexican Church found so scandalous about this movie. At the end of the movie, I was left thinking that philosophical differences with the Church should be explored, but sophmoric mudslinging might just deserve repression."
5,una historia muy dura de creer,", bueno esta es una histora, que creo que le podria pasar a cualquier padre."
3,No big deal,"so what was the big deal about this movie? yes the acting is fine and the story is ok, but shocking and contraversial? yes somewhat but nothing that amazing. Compared to the movie Priest which was out a few years before, this is alot tamer. Watch out for the Magdalene Sisters which is coming to theathers this year for more contraversy."
3,Kind of a disappointment...,"I felt the characters were underdeveloped. You would think that a priest would be a little more anguished about betraying his holy vows. I would have liked to see a little more process and maybe some distress. It would have been different if he was someone who was struggling with the idea of staying in the priesthood, but he talks about devotion to the religion the whole time. I also wonder if it was such a big hit in Mexico due to the shock value of seeing a priest commit adultery in such a devoutly religious, primarily catholic country. I really thought the move had potential and the actors were good. There were some beautiful scenes and not just the ones showing the very attractive priest. I just wish it was a little more psychologically complex."
3,Above average melodrama,"I love Bernal in almost everything he does, but I felt that this vehicle lacks one crucial element: credibility. I never quite believed Bernal as a priest, nor did I believe Amelia to be a pious virgin. As others have observed, no one's hands are clean. Point made, point taken. However, the film devolves into melodrama and is resolved far too easily.Certainly the film is more complex and provocative than the trailer would have you believe. The production is good, as is the cast. But the film never quite rises to the level of being a great film, settling instead for a focus on taboo-breaking rather than genuine introspection and repentance. Does Padre Amaro learn anything except everyone is corrupt? We'll never know."
3,Artsy?,"This movie does in fact make a hit at the Cathoic church.However, you have to remember that this is a movie.Movies are made for entertainment purposes.This movie left me with quite a bit of anger, not because of the fact that I'm catholic, but because he was basically a character that has no idea what he's done. He cant seem to graps that fact that the's done something wrong, the fact that he has taken something away from others.I was furious to be quite frank with the character...so i would have to say that it is a good movie, for those that speak spanish it will make more sense."
1,HIGHLY OVERRATED!!,"I rented this film after seeing that it was nominated for an oscar for best foreign film, and because it stared Gael Garcia Bernal, who was excelent in both Amorres Perros and Y tu mamma tambien. But what a let-down! This movie is confused, disorganized, and sometimes just silly. It's a bad movie, plain and simple. Especially the way way it starts out with political intrigue and corruption within the catholic church, then suddenly becomes a dramitic love story! I found the villainous religious old bag character particularly cartoonish and out of place. But the most surprising is all the beaming reviews! But then, when people write ""it will make you think"", or finish their loving review by recommending ""swimfan"" and ""lawn-mower man"" you know there's something up...."
4,A Price Too High To Pay...,"Father Amaro (Gael García Bernal) has recently been ordained as a priest for the Catholic Church in Mexico and he has been sent to a small Mexican village where he is suppose to help Father Benito (Sancho Gracia). In between the daily responsibilities Father Amaro meets with other priests and the people of the village. One of the girls of the village, Amelia (Ana Claudia Talancón), seeks Father Amaro's attention as she falls in love with him. These are feelings that Father Amaro desires, but they come with a price that he does not want to pay. Crime of Father Amaro is a strong film that displays some of the many opinions and notions that rest within the Catholic Church. In the end, the audience is to experience a good cinematic event as the story unfolds."
5,"Um... I love a less popular, older candybar?","I had a tradition, when I went to my hardware store - buying a Whatchamacallit from the only store in town that carried them. They stopped. I grumped, and bought a box. Honestly, the description is sufficient. Crisp with caramel and then chocolate around it. Love 'em!"
1,If you want to hear good blues...save your money.,"If you want to hear a good Blues CD, save your money. Go get some Charlie Musselwhite or James Cotton, those guys play the Blues. I don't know what this album is. It definitely doesn't know whether it wants to be pop, rock, R&B or Blues and succeeeds in being none of the above. Just a bunch of contrivances trying to be pop hits. Nothing real about any of them. I'd give it no stars if that were a choice. Ugh!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Large print, about 100 pages of written material. There are terms, appendix and other written matter to stretch the book out. The book has very small chapters and seems very cut and paste. It appears alot of repetition in the book. Sounds like Young had to enter into a poor first marriage and didn't get all the assets he hoped for so he is trying to profit off the book. Anyway, I wouldn't waste your money. I actually requested a refund and got my money back for the book and shipping and handling."
5,Tells it like it is,I've never been married and divorced but I read this book out of curiosity. The author tells it like it is and being forewarned is forearmed. The book explains that any benefit of doubt is given to women and better be prepared. There's a lot more details that is worth more than the price of the book both financially and emotionally. Highly Recommended!
2,Cynical and negative,"This book seems to be outlines from presentations pasted together in book form. It is very short, and sometimes repetitive. It has at least one typo per short chapter.If you are parting on amicable terms, this book is not for you. It is cynical of human nature and at times lacking in values.There is a chapter on pre-nuptual agreements, which was probably added to give the book some length. Isn't it a little late fo a pre-nup when you are considering divorce?There are a few helpful tidbits, but this book is more of a booklet, and is not worth $20 or anything close to it.Chaplain (Major) H.

5,ESSENTIAL TRAVELING COMPANION,"THIS ATLAS IS THE MOST COMPLETE YET EASY TO USE TOOL WE HAVE EVER OWNED. BEING OVER 70 YEARS OF AGE AND ON OUR FIRST 5000 MILE DRIVE THROUGH NINE COUNTRIES, WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING LOST, UNABLE TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AND PLOTTING THE NEXT DAYS TRAVEL. THE MICHELIN ROAD ATLAS-EUROPE MET ALL OF OUR NEEDS AND MADE THE TRIP EASY AND FUN. WE HAD NO ACCOMODATION RESERVATIONS BUT WITH THE AID OF THIS BOOK WERE ABLE TO FIND SUITABLE GUEST HOUSES EACH EVENING WITH TIME TO SPARE. WE CANNOT PRAISE THIS TOOL ENOUGH---IT IS EXCELLENT AND WELL DONE."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping that this book would be very helpful, since it got such great reviews; however, I was disappointed by it. I recently discovered I had PCOS. I was prescribed metformin and told to follow a low GI diet. The book does a great job of explaining how and why a low GI diet should work for women with PCOS, but it does a poor job of explaining the actual diet. It makes it very confusing to follow, and although it gives a table of foods along with their GI, it is very vague about telling you what you should be eating. I followed the diet in the book the best that I could, and gained 5 pounds before the first week was over. Also, the recipes in the book were no help to me... each one of them had an ingredient that was either very exotic (lamb meat was one of them) or something that I had never heard of. They cannot realistically expect people to make these recipes on a regular basis. I recommend PCOS and your Fertility by Collette Harris. This was a much better and more helpful book."
5,Need Answers? Read this book!,This book was the answer to years of questions that my pool of doctors failed to answer adequately.
2,Not very helpful,"As a PCOS sufferer, I've done lots of research since being diagnosed. This book may be a great starting point for people who have yet to do any research, but for those have, you will not receive any new information. The recipes are nice, but if I wanted recipes I would have bought a cook book! Not worth the money in my opinion."
2,Tiny & thin book,Decent info but not at all what I was expecting. There are many better PCOS books out there and the G.I. diet info was limited.
4,Informative but repetitive,"This book was a good overview of why a Low GI diet is so important to those suffering from PCOS. It went into a lot of detail regarding the way our bodies process things differently. It was dry, and I thought could have used more recipes, but I'd recommend it as a resource."
