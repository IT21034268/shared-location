5,Le Creuset 2 3/4 Quart casserole - magnifique!,It's a fabulous casserole that is just the right size for a small casserole for two people. I love Le Creuset and can only afford a piece at a time! I bought this one on sale and love the cast iron cooking method. Easy to clean up and the Flame Orange is so cheery!
1,I Love Lucy--but--hate this 5 box set.,"As a Lucy fan, I was rather disappointed in this 5 box set. The first four videos are redundant and simply show the same material with a small piece of something new thrown in every now and then--with each consecutive video. The 5th video is a double feature (60 minutes) and this is the only reason I gave this review 1 star. The `Goodtimes Home Video Corp."" did an awful job putting together a documentary of Lucy's career."
3,FROM FULL HOUSE TO THE DOG HOUSE,"I was jacked to read FULL HOUSE 3, and was pleased to see the venom between the two lead characters continues to escalate.Lies, deceit, and petulance mark this volume, as Ryder's Master of Disguise plan is found out, and he's gone from Full House to the Dog House!This volume seems to really tell it all when it comes to Ryder. He becomes more than the celebrity everyone knows he is, and what's worse Alley has to suffer through the dinner from hell when she has to meet Ryder's family! UGH! But discovering who Ryder really is may not be a person we want to see, especially when we find out his own plans for Full House"
5,A gorgeous visual display for any library strong in either interior design or Chinese art and architecture,"Chinese art, architecture and design has a long history and blends many elements from a tradition of wooden courtyard structures, evolving to blend different styles. Modern Chinese interiors are here presented with full-page color photos - many documenting eclectic mixes of old and new styles, while descriptions document choices and discuss how these different choices blended in. It's a gorgeous visual display for any library strong in either interior design or Chinese art and architecture, holding a wide range of contemporary examples."
4,Organizing the Public Sector Economics Study,"This guide is usefull to organize the studing of public finance. Due to the large amount of practice questions and review notes, this book serves as a complete guide to the reading of The Economy of the Public Sector.In my personal point of view, its ideal to complement the reading of the book with this complete study guide."
4,Check it Out !,"This is one book which can help you to unleash your creativity with PDF. Even if you are a guru of PDF, this shall make you better..."
3,hello i am not sure about this,hello the picture showed a usb wireless adapter. i got a adapter for a laptop well can't say much after that.
4,Fantastic portrait of a leader,"Mac Butler was a citizen soldier, an ordinary guy who was called to active duty. He served in the tradition of his fore-bearers, including General John ""Mac"" Alexander McClernand who was commissioned by President Abraham Lincoln. He served and inspired his men, and this book tells the story ably and humbly. That their unit was the only one not to give ground during the Battle of the Bulge is ample testimony of Col. Butler's leadership. (The book reports that at times enemy artillery came in from nearly all points of the compass.)In my opinion this book describes in vivid detail why our citizen-soldiers won the war against the professional soldiers of Germany. This is a great read for an up-close perspective on one ordinary man's willingness to give all for his men and his country.In reunions after the war, the men showed their continued loyalty and respect for Mac when they presented him with a plaque commemorating the ""Battlin' Blue Bastards."""
2,BEWARE !! All songs previously available !!!!,"Putting aside the fact that the songs on this disc are great tunes , I bought this based on the title . Shame on me for thinking that these were ""extended versions"" of the cuts when in fact they are the exact same versions from ""Twenty"" and ""Live from Steeltown"" . I can't understand why the previous reviewers are going so crazy over this . Don't you guys already own the aforementioned two CDs ?"
1,Not what I wanted,"When I first saw this CD I thought it was all the hits on one CD until I played it on my computer so I could hear ''Sweet Home Alabama'' and when it started to play it, it was LIVE!!!! It said nowhere on the case it was live, and I am not a big fan of live CDS! So if you think this is a ''greatest hits'' CD with the original studio recordings, its not."
1,Be Forewarned!,"This is not an album of extended versions , but instead a live album (I guess it was recorded from Pittsburg, but I'm not sure if all of the cuts are.) The songs sound terrible and this is a complete waste of money except for very select Skynyrd fans."
5,Grand,"I love love love this musical, and this songbook is just a must have when you feel like belting all by yourself! I played Mary in this play five years ago, and to Dean from Houston, I know what you mean about those Shelleys! Why are they hanging out with dead people if they are alive? I'm glad someone else out there shares in my frustration! The Secret Garden is a very emotional musical. The lyrics are absolutely beautiful, and the music is just wonderful. i love it!"
1,Ordering glitch?,"I'm a HUGE fan of Amazon, and this is really the first time I haven't been happy with a purchase. I was TRYING to buy a copy of the script for ""The Secret Garden"" by Lucy Norman published by Samuel French Co. Unfortunately when I went to purchasing options hoping I could download the script onto my Kindle, it sent me the easy piano version of the show! My biggest complaint is that I wasn't able to double check or amend my order; it all happened automatically when I clicked on the button for Kindle. So, I haven't opened the book. I already have the piano score for the show, and definitely don't have any use of easy piano music, especially on my Kindle. That's the only reason I'm upset by this transaction, especially after having had such positive experiences in the past. Maybe someone at Amazon can look into why this happened. Did I do something wrong? I can't imagine that I'm the only one with the problem. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"
3,Does not include chords,I was dissapointed to find that this sheet music does not include the chords/tabs for fake book style players. If that is something you look for in piano music - just a heads up.
5,Please let the book be avalible!,"Well I'm looking for the full score of The Secret Garden, so I search everywhere in amazon and this is the most possible one to be the full score. You should buy a record of this musical and you can see there are 28 people's reviews there, everybody loved it after hearing it, and I did.One day I found out a record in Tower which is another version of The Secret Garden, it's a comic-picture-covered CD and it's expensive. So I ask my father bought me the CD from Amarica, and he bought me this version. I think it great and I can't got ths CD out of my cd player. After that I bought that expensive one of The Secret Garden.... Compare to this, it's like a cheap, soap musical with too much laced background music. ....Mnnn... it's great, I bet..."
2,"The Secret Garden had a slow start,","The Secret Garden had a slow start and gave too much detail, butit got better when Mary starts to be nicer to everyone. Then it got slow again. I would not recomend this book because it is too long, gives too much detail, and the author uses too many unfamiliar words for younger readers. This is why I gave this book 2 stars out of five."
4,nice!!,i think the richest song of this cd is In Awe of a Painting that song i think its magical and i can heard it again and again. its a real pleasure to listen to ana!!!
1,"horrible, cheap","I paid full price for this toy when it first came out, big mistake, one of the wheels flips up all the time, and then it topples over frustrating my youngest all the time, and then I have to go and pull the wheel back out again so they can push it, plus the wheels don't turn at all left to right, so they are constantly scooting it and dragging it into the walls, it really isn't worth more than $10, don't waist your money, you are better off buying an actual doll buggy or stroller"
1,Shame on you Fisher-Price!!,"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous review!! I bought two of these for my twin daughters for Christmas yesterday. They were so excited to use them & the first one broke right out of the box!! If left in wagon mode, these might be okay, but the girls think it's fun to switch back & forth from teeter-totter to wagon. And it should be easy to do!! It was difficult for me & if it's not done just right, the wheel mechanism breaks & won't go down all the way or come back upright. Save your money on this one ~ a stroller is definitely better. Mine will be returned & I'll have two sad little girls....."
1,hi,the 3 in one little mommy I bought it for xmas I hope I am more happy then the other familys we will seee this xmas thats why I only paid 8.00 I dont pay full price for toys becouse I know they are not worth it smile
4,ADORABLE!!!!,"I got this newborn kitten for my birtday in June.I play with it a lot and I have not have to change the batteries!! My fav. Furreal product so far was the newborn puppy and Luv Cub.This one is good also! The kitten is sooo cute and has soft vevlty fur!! It is fun to play with, but not like all the time!!Good job Furreal Friends^_^"
4,Really Cute!!!!!,"The kittens r soooo cute and have such real sounds!!!! Just don' get the white ones, they look dirty after a while!"
5,I am getting it!,The only place I have seen this toy is the Argos catalogue. I'm getting it. I have a Furreal Friends Cat and I was SO satisfied I want this one. It comes with a carrier. It opens and closes its eyes. I don't know whether to get the grey or yellow or cream. Probably Cream. (Thats the colour of my cat you see) I love kittens and cats but I am allergic to them so I like the toys because they are the only ones I am not allergic to the toys. I love all kinds of the cat family. I am sure I LOVE THIS TOY!Bye!
3,It's okay but not as good the cat,"I have a white Furreal cat and I just got my clalico kitten today. So far it's okay. It's a good idea. It's really hard for me to turn on my cat, but that might just be my model! This cat does NOT have tons of noises and it falls to sleep very quickly. You have to hit it's back slightly hard to wake it up but don't pound it too hard. This kitten is cute but not as much fun as the Furreal cat.[...]"
2,This thig is ugly!,"If you are planning on getting this toy for your child change you mind!It is the ugliest thing,it just meows when you push on it's back,and the only noise it makes is meowing and purring.It also goes to sleep every five seconds whether your playing with it or not!"
1,"ugly! THe idea is good,but a new bron is never cute.",THis cat is so ugly!It looks like a toy that was made in a day. (Thats not a good thing)
1,Bad Design,"I do not recommend this product.This case screws onto the bottom of the camera. It wraps around the front and back of camera and offers no protection for the sides, especially when in pocket with keys or in purse. When taking pictures, you either have to deal with the case hanging from the bottom of the camera, or take the time to unscrew it."
5,I liked this book,This is a good story. All children do things that they aren't suppose to do. The character isn't any different and in the end the character realizes the error of her ways and we would all hope that children will do the same. I highly recommend this books. It is well written and fast paced.
5,Journal of a Trapper,"This is by far one of the best books that a fur trade re-enactor can read. It is also a must read for the modern beaver trapper as well. Osborne describes the everyday events of the fur brigades in their heyday. If you are a buckskinner, living historian, trapper or just an old west history buff then this is a MUST have!"
5,Very good older horror flick,I agree that this movie is awesome and who would have thought as cheesy as it sounds that it would be so good?? I love the older Italian horror movies and this one is right up there with them. I just wish they would bring alot of these older movies out on DVD.....this one and Deathship is at the top of my list for movies that need to be on DVD. Great movie!!
5,It will teach you and tickle your gills!,"Few can capture the mystery and peculiarity of science like Ray Troll. Whether he's painting the his favorite piscine pal -- the ratfish -- or he's sketching a paleontological history of a distant Montanan basin, Troll has a knack for mixing the perfect amount of fact with the perfect amount of fancy for an unforgettable experience. He's got a great sense of humor, too, as evidenced by some of his zanier and darker works. ""Rapture of the Deep"" is a great introduction to Troll's work, and gives readers a perfect notion of what it is that makes this artist so unique. It is a must for any fish- or science-lover who is passionate but doesn't take him/herself too seriously. Enjoy!"
3,"You'll have to sift through some fluff, but it's a fairly swift read with some good advice.","There's good advice in here. It's basic advice, but it's good. Throw things away, take it a bit at a time, and so on.Unfortunately, it's also, uh, ""funny.""Hypothetical situation: If you got a gift subscription to Reader's Digest from a friend would you beA) happy, because it's a publication you respect and enjoy?B) Indifferent, because you can at least skim the headlines and humor and then chuck it? OrC) secretly annoyed because it's written at a fifth grade level?You'll feel the same way about this book once you start reading it.I'd give this fewer stars, but the advice wasn't actually bad, and maybe it'll do you some good. I'll be abandoning my copy in a 'free books' pile; none of the ideas therein will be new to those of my acquaintance who might want the help."
1,Frustrating.,"Bought this, brought it home, won't play. Apparently learning from above reviews it has something to do with a video card? Trust me, i have no idea what video card i have, all i know is that i can play anything else. Very disappointed; so is my 3 year old. Opened, can't return. [...]."
1,Beware the requirements!,"I can't recommend this game...because my kids can't play it. It has a specific video card requirement that apparently my children's new PC does not have (according to Namco) - and of course since it's been opened it cannot be returned. I understand reading the requirements and being aware of your processor speed, your RAM, OS, etc., but what average consumer goes into a store aware of video card driver compatibilities?The company's response? Get a better video card. I'll stick to Xbox from now on."
1,Warning! Contains copy-protection malware!,"When I installed the game I noticed that it installed StarForce copy protection software along with it. Needless to say, I have had to replace my DVD/CD-Rom drive and reformat my hard-drive. I now know to stay clear of software containing StarForce.The game itself isn't so hot either. I made it about a third of the way through before I was stuck in a loop and unable to continue. Steer clear!"
2,Curious George - PC Game Review,"My 5 year old son and I have played this game numerous times. WHile the graphics are quite impressive and the concept very cool....It does have some major issues. (For e.g. unable to change the controls on the keyboard, unable to save your current progress so one has to start from ground zero everytime you quit, unable to get past one jungle scene...we have tried everything and cannot get past a certain vine jump....we are unable to access the other levels so the game is virtually useless past a certain point.) There is no help options...DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE."
1,All of the negative reviews are correct,"I wish I had seen these before loading this game. Way to dificult for my six year old to play, or even for an adult. Very frustrating to say the least -- stay away from this game."
1,Dangerous Malware,"I have never before posted a negative review of a product, but felt compelled to do so after my experiences with this ""product.""I gave this game as a birthday gift to my young nephew, but his parents were unable to make it run on their BRAND NEW HP laptop (running Windows 7). I helped them uninstall and re-install the software several times, but no luck; still got the same ""Starforce"" error messages.Foolishly, I then tried to load the software on my own Dell laptop (also running Windows 7). The result? System crashed, and my computer would no longer boot. I had to run system restore to get this horrible program off my computer and recover my original configuration.I should have Googled ""Starforce"" before trying to load this MALWARE on my own PC. Apparently I'm not alone in having problems with StarforceAs for th game itself; I can't comment on how good it is, since I haven't been able to make it run."
4,The Katrinas Timeless,This CD is a very soothing to listen to. Each song has a special feel and sound. It is upbeat and enjoyable.
1,another failed eye cream,fell for yet another claim for the best eye cream. i've used it diligently and according to the instructions for several weeks and still no noticeable changes or improvements. when will i learn? I had to give it one star in order to post. so i guess i can say it's worthy of one star because the gel has a nice cooling sensation when applied.
4,Ole Henriksen Ultimate Lift Eye Gel,Thank you for sending a second product after I complained about the first. Well done.Sandra McCormick
4,"EFFECTIVE, FRESH, LONG LASTING","Love products that do good things for me when I sleep, so this Eye Gel from Ole Henriksen is at the top of my ""What's Best When I Rest"" list!Only a tiny amount is needed for application under the eyes and moving toward the temple. It's a smooth, refreshing gel, ice blue in color but transparent when applied. Fragrance free the Gel doesn't do aroma battle with night time skin treatments.Additions of cucumber and calendula erase under eye puffiness while also discouraging laugh lines (aka wrinkles!).My 1 oz. jar is a month old and it doesn't even look used. Another plus for this product is the expiration date of 2010 - it came fresh and stays fresh.- Gail Cooke"
1,Did not live up to expectations.,Have used this product for several weeks and have seen absolutely no difference. Definitely will not purchase again. On the other hand they sent me a sample of Truth Revealed Super Creme which has been phenomenal! Within about two weeks of using it I began receiving all sorts of compliments in regards to how great my skin looks (I am 50). I am not kidding - my skin looks youthful and glowing. Ordered more immediately. Thanks for the sample Ole!
3,Eye Cream,This is nice eye cream. I've used it now for three weeks and I'm not sure if I notice a difference yet. But I use it every day - morning and night. It's not sticky and smells good.
2,Very uncomfortable,I can't speak to the long term effects of this eye gel as I only used it once. I did not think that it dried well. My under eyes were left feeling sticky to the point of discomfort and it burned my skin. Definitely try a sample before you purchase this in case you have the same reaction. I agree with the other reviewer--Oil of Olay is better and for a much lower cost.
5,One of my favorite face products!,I just love this stuff soooo much! It just feels good instantly and no matter what it never irritates my eyes!
4,Entertaining & Enlightening,"Jig is an exciting look at the world of Irish dance from the dancers' perspective. Having a dance group made up of primarily adults (20 and older), this will be a movie the ladies can watch in their homes and maybe learn a step or two, but more importantly, understand a little more of the history of Irish dance.Would highly recommend this film for dancers as well as anyone who loves Irish culture."
5,Wonderful and Adicting,"I love this movie. I literally watched it three nights in a row. It showcases the true work and dedication that goes into this sport. I love the age range, 10 to mid 20's! Super inspirational. Would give this to any Irish dancer!"
5,Awesome,"I absolutely love this movie. As a former Irish Dancer I thought the movie was amazing. The family commitment, the dancers love of dance and the teachers demand for excellence were illustrated so precisely. Love it. Love it. Love it."
3,Great fun but...,"I bought this on spec and had no idea what to expect. The presentation is outstanding and the young dancers quite wonderful. Why only 3 stars? I was hoping for a bit more about Irish dancing, its history and technique but this is for those that know all about that and for them this is a 5 star film. It basically follows a collection of quite delightful and charming dancers as they prepare for the World Championships in Glasgow. How it managed to follow the winners is a bit of a mystery and it is not at all clear how much was filmed before and how much afterwards as it implies it is all before but it is hard to believe they could forcast the winners so well! Anyway take it as you find it, delightful stars and well transferred to disc"
2,Not what I expected.,"I was expecting a presentatation similar to a ""Riverdance"" performance, by student performers. I was not interested in the commentary, and the ""limited"" competition type presentation."
3,Wings of Sorrow - Issue To Be Resolved By Vendor,"The images for these wings were far from accurate. When the wings came in, they were tiny (small is an understatement), poorly made, with a bunch of the feathers off the cardboard base laying in the bag the wings came in. We had to re-glue the feathers back on the cardboard to try to make them work for a Halloween Costume. Our disappointment was great to say the least. I could have made better wings myself. Fortunately, upon calling the Vendor, Costume Hub, they explained the wings have been pulled from inventory, that they were sent the wrong wings by the manufacturer and would be issuing a full refund and not require the wings to be sent back in. They stated they will no longer be offering these wings due to the manufacturer problems. Which is why there is a 3 Star Rating Verse a 1 to 0 Star Rating - Their Customer Service."
2,Blackness,"I liked the price of these, but the quality left something to be desired. About a dozen or more of the feathers fell off. The black dye rubbed off on the back of the shirt I was wearing with these. Some of the dye also got on my hands when I handled the wings (turned my fingers grayish). I probably wouldn't buy these again but the price was right for a once a year Halloween costume."
5,Great buy on soon-to-be-obsolete cables,"I still have one application where I needed component cables to hook up my DVD recorder to my non HDMI television and these cables certainly fit the bill. I have quite a few hundred dollars tied up in Monster Cables - but when I replace my TV, everything will be simple HDMI connections. Another era has come and gone (I guess for the better)."
2,Very bulky,"I thought I'd get these guys to see what all the hubub was about, but found myself disappointing. I felt silly after buying them because I didn't notice a difference in quality.Pros: It works?Cons: They are so bulky and thick that my TV mounted on the wall will not angle down enough because they stick out of the back so far. You need a solid few inches of clearance from the plug. This is a problem if you need to have it close to the wall or need to loop them up from the bottom. Big issue for no gain and higher price. This bulk is completely unnecessary."
3,Monster,"Monster - great cables, however I was unaware that I should have ordered another cable with these for sound, as you have no sound with these 3... But I am sure they would be great if you had all the cables..."
3,Edition--The Normal Christian Life,"I purchased 5 copies of Watchman Nee's, The Normal Christian Life because reading my old copy was bringing much spiritual understanding of the book of Romans. The yellow paper back copies I purchased were the same size as my copy but with much smaller print. I think this is unfortunate, as the difficulty people may experience in reading it may cause them not to continue to the end."
5,superb. should be considered essential reading,"I have read this book three times in the past three years and God continues to use this to draw me into a deeper, more loving, more obedient, more joyful relationship with Him. This is not a must-have just for your bookshelf. This is a must-have for YOUR LIFE. This, IN ADDITION, to the Word of God, should be considered essential reading!"
5,A truly wonderful book,"You can approach this book in two ways. The first is just read it. Contents will bless and amaze you. It is, in a sense, the most straight forward presentation of what Christianity should be. Second, you may want to take the time to actually look up and ponder the scriptures he references. The book can easily absorb and direct a bible study of significant length. I'd say that if I were to teach a foundations of Christianity class, this would be the textbook. Yet, I read this book nearly 20 years ago and when I read it recently, it amazed me and at times, blew me away."
4,clear explanation,"Nee gives the best explanation of the Book of Romans in the Bible that I've read. A must read for those who are studying the Book of Romans. He is a bit long winded, and I thought some examples could have been shorter. However, he makes the point of his teaching well."
5,awesome,"Somewhat of an exposition of the book of Romans. Truths are clearly presented and related to the Christian experience. The last chapter, ""The Goal of the Gospel"", is golden."
5,A classic book that lays out the path to victorious living,"Watchman Nee takes the reader through principles taught in the book of Romans. The focus of the book is Jesus Christ and the believer's life in Him. At times Nee seems redundant and repetitive with his message and with his illustrations. But by the end, you thoroughly understand the concepts he presents. This book was an important key to my growth as a Christian. In my opinion, it should be a must read for every person serious about living a God honoring life."
5,"Illuminating, guilt destroying, Christian exhortation","""The Normal Christian Life"", next to the Bible, is one of the most fundamental books for spiritual growth and peace. It will cause an awakened awareness of the love of God, and the true nature of the paths of righteousness for His name sake. It sheds the light of reason with the Word of God on -- SIN -- and the -- SIN NATURE -- and the Work of Jesus Christ in our lives that delivers us from them and all condemnation and bondage to them."
5,recommending this book to the seeking Christians,"When I read the first chapter, my eyes was really opened up. It is a great enlightenment for the seeking Christians on earth. When we come forward to God what we do notdepend on our behavior(regardless good or bad), it depends on the precious blood of Christ. Watchman Nee really helps us to see and experience the genuine spirituality."
3,ok,"Well reality is I have not yet started reading it, eventhough I am going to a Bible study class for it. The discussions have been good of the chapters we have read so it must be OK."
3,Not As Heavy As Expected,"While I am satisfied with the overall quality of this Le Creuset Spoon Rest, I was a little surprised to learn that it wasn't as heavy as I'd hoped. I thought, like most spoon rests, that it would be heavy enough not to move around too much while one is picking up and putting down whatever kitchen tool is in use while cooking...this is not the case. It does move a little bit due to its lack of weight, and thus I have debated whether or not to put a suction cup on the bottom to prevent this. I was not expecting that, but that is my only complaint. The cherry color is absolutely stunning and vibrant, and adds the perfect splash of red to my stove area."
5,Beautiful heart shaped dish with nicely detailed rim!,"I purchased this item on a whim from Amazon.com, since there really wasn't much to go by (lack of photo and description). I searched online and found this exact item through the Le Creuset website...Very durable, microwave, oven and broiler safe (up to 500 deg), and simple white color takes you beyond just a Valentine's Day dinner - and white really highlites the beauty of the food you're cooking in it. Bake a cobbler, brownies, cake, bread, or a casserole! I used mine the same day I received it to bake stuffed baby portabella mushrooms. Excellent presentation!"
5,A solid nancy drew title.,"This game is good like all other nancy drew games but, this one is more creepy and erie. I recommend this to anyone who wants to play a nancy drew game or any adventure pc game that is quite easy to get into. This was one of my favorites. Hope this helped."
5,nancy drew lover,love anything ND havent played it yet but i bet it will be awesome just like the rest of her games.
4,Like my '94 Camry,"My 1994 Toyota Camry is hopelessly out of date. No heated seats, no GPS, no CD player. It also has more than a few signs of wear. But it is a car that's firmly attached to the fundamentals: getting you from here to there in comfort and safety at a reasonable price.There may be a lesson here: things that are built on fundamental concerns about function don't go out of style. The Greengrocer is a bit out of date:there are many more varieties of produce available today than in 1972. The attitude towards food is distinctly contemporary, even prophetic. Here was a guy-Joe Carcione- who loved the things he sold and took them seriously. He paid careful attention to the fundamentals and, what a surprise!-his book is both useful and charming as a result.Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The and the perennially up-to-date bang BANG: A Novel"
3,Starting Point,"I was pleasantly surprised by this volume in Osprey's Essential Histories series. In a scant one hundred pages the author does an excellent job of capturing the essential facts relating to these conflicts sprinkled with useful maps and chronologies as well as some superb representational pieces of period art. I enjoyed the two interesting sidebars, one on a British naval officer and another on Nelson's ladylove, Emma Hamilton. The short bibliography lists two of my favorites, Paddy Griffith's ART of WAR of REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE and T.C.W.Blanning's THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS. Fremont-Barnes has done a very good job on supplying the interested reader an introduction to an extremely colorful and fascinating period."
4,Great for pretend play.....accept,"We ordered this set to go with the wooden dolls we purchases our kids for christmas. They emediatly took to the set and loved it. It didn't take much though and one of the doors on the little entertainment center broke off. I probably should have sent it back but the kids still like playing with it and there are no sharp ends so we just kept it. I was disappointed though since I just ordered it at Christmas, it lasted about 2 weeks. The rest of the set has held up fine."
5,doll furniture,it looks nice in my nieces doll house. i thought it was really cute and it added fun to her doll house.
2,Ryans Room Relaxing In style Living Room,Fantastic detail.. My Grandson is fascinated with all the room pieces.The cord on the lamp actually pulls! Great fun
2,Could be longer...,"I purchased this plastic mat for my son who's in kindergarten and unfortunately, the mat was too short for him."
1,DO NOT BUY,I had it for only 1 month...then the thing froze completely. It only had like 41% filled and it froze. DO NOT BUY. It is a waste of time and money.
1,CO K,The acting in this movie is Pathetic.... The Props are horrible.. Don't waste your money on this extremely crappy movie..
1,Would not play,"I tried 3 DVD's of this title, in 4 players. None would play. Amazon was prompt in furnishing replacements & the final refund. Other DVD's from Amazon, before & after theses attempts, played. I don't know why Company K wouldn't play."
1,Company K,"DVD was not formatted for the USA. I was authorized, after many attempts, to return the DVD at my expence. The cost to ship it back was not worth it. Since The item did not specify what code the country was, I assumed it was the USA. I should be able to return the item at their expense shouldn't I?Please advise.Thank you"
4,Very cute and durable.,Only draw back is that the accessories (shelves and toilet paper dispenser) don't actually stick to the walls at all....you have to use your own wood glue to get them to stay.The toilet is the best part and the mirror gives a surprisingly good reflection! Very chunky and sturdy - perfect for my 2.5 yr old
5,Very stturdy,"My kids love to play it , I would buy more of this from the future, very sturdy ,good quality"
5,Homage to the great Garland!!,"It cannot be described, but experienced. If you have any questions regarding Judy Garland's talent as a singer, you must buy this collection. It spans a lifetime of her recordings. I have two of these, I love it that much!"
2,there's much better Judy stuff available,"Believe it or not the people who put this together actually CUT part of a song from the Carnegie Hall album because they didn't like it! When people are disrespectful in that kind of way to the integrity of the material you know you're not getting top quality stuff.There are some good things scattered through the album--maybe some of it is not available elsewhere. The book that comes with it has some wonderful pictures and a hodge-podge of essays, some good/interesting, some poorly written."
2,Aw man!,So much promise but so little effort! This really could have been done well but wasn't. My love for Adam West and Burt Ward were the only reasons I got this. Frank Gorshin's Riddler was a delight to see again as well!
1,"From an Old Batman TV Show Fan: 2.5 Laughs, 1 Star","I grew up in the '60s watching the great old campy Batman TV series, and so I really, really, really wanted to like Legends of the Superheros. I laughed twice and nearly laughed a third time, all during the second half, the ""roast"" of the Superheroes with Ed McMahon. The rest of this dreary DVD wasn't clever enough to be campy; it was just bad. The talents of Frank Gorshin and other great actors were just wasted, and the actresses got to do virtually nothing at all, serving primarily as window dressing. Because it featured superheroes, and especially superheroes I like, including the very same Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward) from the original Batman TV series, I made myself watch the whole thing, and even the DVD extras (including a villainously unfunny blooper reel). I'm sorry to say that this is the worst thing I've ever forced myself to watch from start to finish."
5,its a fun show,its a fun show and i a great deal.its just as good as i remember seeing it as a child
1,Aweful,"The plot is bad, the acting is bad, and the jokes are worse. It's not even campy enough to be fun."
3,Over the top Campy,"Nice trip down memory lane - back to the time when special effects were wiggly lines hand drawn on final film edits. Back in the day, though, there was no way to get a super hero fix but through this cornball type of costume characters.If you're under six. or over sixty, it'll bring a smile to your face. In between, you'll probably feel short changed."
4,a 70's classic!,So glad to have this near perfect quality dvd copy to replace the glitchy multi generation vhs copy I have had for 20+ years!
3,Silly and Hokey Fun,Just awful but silly and a bit fun too. Save your money. Look for the original Batman movie instead. Now that one is a classic.
3,Borish,"This book was boring. It took all I had to stay awake past the anecdotal tellings of witchcraft of past. This subject is a sensitive one, and I feel that it would be best told straight out, no running from the obvious as the author clearly has."
3,Brief but well written.,This is a great book for someone who is looking for more information on Paganism or someone new to it. The essays were well researched and easy to read and digest.
3,"OK video quality, but 40% shorter than described","The video quality of this DVD was a little better than 'Cami - Sweet Nudes', probably because it was shot indoors. The camera angle was at times inept, obscuring the very nudity the video is trying to show; but at least there was enough variety to get in some good shots.The video's run time is actually 46 minutes, not the ""75 minutes"" of the description, plus 5 minutes of ""slideshow"" video of pictures taken during the shoot. (At least the product description of this disc doesn't mis-characterize this slideshow as ""HD"" when it's SD. :-)And the soundtrack of the video has a mellow version of the stereotypical-porn-movie quality, with not as pulsating a rhythm.The video took up less than 3.3 Gb of the DVD-R, which leaves well over 1 Gb of free space (where copies of the slideshow images could have been placed, for instance).Just realize that there's not 75 minutes of video, and that the David-Nudes.com website is promoted."
3,First DVD did not load,This DVD did not load when I received it. Customer Service sent a replacement and after a couple of tries it loaded and played just fine. Good product. Will return defective one.
1,I feel that this item is a rip-off.,I bought this mattress a week ago. I observed that the price is the most expensive brand in Amazon for similar items. I was hoping it's better pad than other competitor.My opinion is it's a total ripp-off. The mattress is so thin with very little magnetic on it.
2,Killed my Koi,Once I installed the filter a film of oil or grease seeped into my pond (I presume sealant for the lid). All of my koi died within 24 hours.
3,"Covers different ground, yes...","The Italian Campagian is often overlooked by many military writers, this book fills a gap. I did not enjoy it as much as other WWII titles. I found the first few chapters quite boring, with sections of fact that were new to me. Until more books on the ""battle for the boot"" are written, this book is a good addition to your collection."
4,short but essential reading,"There are many introductions to linguistics; Henry Widdowson's book not only provides an excellent overview of the basics it does so on only 80 pages (main text). For those who want (or need) more, the author provides excepts from other books, a list of references and a glossary.Because the book is short it is necessarily dense. However, the concepts are explained clearly and'without being overly verbose. To say that Widdowson ""calls on the reader to define what the subdisciplines of linguistics should be studying"" (an Amazon reviewer) is only partially true. In the main text the areas of inquiry are clearly outlined. In the extracts from other books, however, Widdowson shows that different authors draw the boundaries between the various sub-disciplines differently. Of course, this may be difficult to accept for those who demand one irrevocable academic truth."
3,Worth the quick read ...,"This book contains a few errors that affect its credibility (e.g. John Glenn was 77, not 65, when he returned to space in '98). The errors don't ruin the positions that the authors take, but they do undermine an arrogant stance that they choose to adopt in places, often directed at NASA; the authors criticize others for such sloppiness and hypocrisy, ironically. Let's raise the bar for everyone involved in the pursuit of space, including the prominent authors of this book. Most readers do want the book to succeed, for space's sake. Have a quick read and provide constructive feedback for the 2nd edition. It needs an index, a bibliography, a more positive balance in places, and some general polish to rid the feeling that the book was rushed to press. It does have interesting content: a look at companies and technologies and trends in the space industry. Download the first chapter for free from Dobb's space.com and go from there ..."
1,Lou Dobbs should stick to what he knows best,Poor explanation of the industry. Shows a complete lack of understanding of the space industry. Was amused by the other reviewers (Lou Dobbs as NASA Administrator--I guess wasting tens of millions on Space.com wasn't enough for the reviewer). Seems that the other reviews were written by people more interested in space as an idea than as a business. Lou Dobbs should stick to what he does best -- being a business newscaster.
1,The Truth behind SLAVE.com,"After a procession of inept Upper Management Lou 'writing' a book 'profiting from his experience' there is a joke.His continued micromanagment and focus on things that didn't really matter in the long term run of the company proved to be a complete waste of time.And some of the Upper management that allowed him to do that were just as guilty of the inevitable failure of the company. While he can be a very charming man, his penchant for megalomania proved to be the detriment of the company.If this is an example on how to run a company, then this should be rephrased on how not to run a company."
1,Unrealistic,"Mr. Dobbs's personal interest in space is genuine. So is mine. But to claim that space and business are on the verge of an explosive boom - well, that was over-optimistic even before the Columbia disaster. Now it looks as unlikely as ever.........unless of course American companies are willing to out-source satellite-launching to foreign countries like China, at a fraction of the cost in the US. That's the only hope for a boom in space-related businesses, and the more down-to-Earth solution.A handful of super-rich space-tourists willing to risk their lives on a Russian rocket are simply not enough to make an industry. Besides, manned spaceflight is now on indefinite hold in the US, which renders space tourism stillborn, at least in the US.Mr. Dobbs ought to plant his feet firmly in the ground of reality and make a choice at some point which scenario he prefers. The premises of this book are at best premature - at worst totally unrealistic."
1,China: the Next Hope for Space,Lou does not have the wits to realize that China is the only hope for future space business. Otherwise his scheme is totally out of this world. Save your money - don't buy this book.
2,Gemini shouldn't touch this song,"This is without a doubt a great song, except for the Chipmunks who are scatting on it. The REAL version from Scatman John is far better. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,This is the positive song of the 90's,"Folks, this single was not originally by Gemini...it is actually by an artist called 'Scatman John', a 56 year-old Jazz/Techno artist from the States, who, since 1995, has become somewhat of a European dance sensation with his unique style.Yes, the song is catchy, loud, and infectious. What you hear is John's skill at 'Scat-singing'...something he perfected by accident as he is a person who stutters. He decided to use his stutter as a positive asset, instead of the problem it used to be.He has done a lot more work, (many of his CDs available here), but 'Scatman' was his creation and debut song that took the globe by storm. Buy it, and you won't be disappointed. It's kinda an infusion of Jazz, pop, and techno...very original.Contact me if you want any further info! :-)-Gina W. (actually a 'biased-as-hell' friend of the artist!) :-)"
4,Great early work by one of Australia's finest,"I've been a fan of Something for Kate for awhile now seeing them twice in concert and owning the later albums Echolalia and Official Fiction so when I saw this album on sale I thought I'd give this one a go as well. The first thing I noticed was how raw it seemed compared to their highly polished later works. Far from making this a worse album than those it just makes it equally good in a different way. It struck me how much Dempsey's voice resembles Bush frontman Gavin Rossdales in this album and even some of the music was Bushesque which I loved being a huge fan of that band. If your only into Something for Kate for their radio friendly pop songs then this album probably isn't for you but any true fan of the band should definately get this. Album highlights include Captain Million miles an hour), Paintbrushes and my favourite Soundczech."
3,Good introduction to diabetes self-care,"This book is a great overview of the basics on how to deal with using insulin. At the same time, there are a lot of individualized issues for staying out of trouble that each diabetic learns with time for him/herself that the book doesn't quite get to. With the upcoming availability of continuous sensors for blood sugar monitoring in conjunction with fingerstick testing, this field is going soon to expand into a whole new world of improved management that will require the next edition. I'd recommend this edition right now, though, for a thorough start."
5,Still learning,"I have been type 1 for over 20 years and have always tried to stay as well informed as possible. That being said, I still learned things from reading this book. Most of it was an overview of things I already understand, but I did discover some quality tips to tighten my control. I really hope that there will be another version some day that includes more information on continuous glucose monitoring systems."
3,Now somewhat outdated,"This isn't a bad book if you are new to using insulin, but just FYI: this book still talks about Lente/Ultralente, which is no longer available, at least in the US. There is some info on Lantus, which has taken over as a basal for many insulin users, but not enough. It has a lot of info on NPH, which many users have stopped using now that Lantus/Determir are available. So the insulin info is dated.Also a caution: the writer uses a pump. Expect to read pump-biased therapy. If you want a good book that is more up-to-date on insulins and methodology, as well as dietary guidelines, get Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution (the 2007 edition). With the Bernstein book, you'll learn how to inject insulin in minute doses to approximate the results from a pump without the pump hassles or the pump cost."
3,Good for beginners,"So far, I've only read part of the book. It has a lot of information for beginner diabetics, but I've been Type 1 for over 20 years. I've picked up a few pointers and things I want to try to control my diabetes better. With the price, it's worth it if it helps me get better control."
2,way too complicated,The book is way too complicated--nearly rocket science. I am glad I have read others that take a simpler approach and not so clinical. Most people would be totally lost or discouraged by this one.
5,Great Information,I ordered this book after reading the good reviews on it and I found it to be an excellent read. My 5 year old daughter is Type 1 diagnosed a year ago. I read as much as I can on diabetes and found this book answered those little nagging questions I have always had. We have a great endo but they can only give you so much information at each appointment. I think alot of learning about handling ones diabetes is trial and error and Gary Scheiner brought that up in the book along with ways to try to figure out what works for you. I highly recommend this book!
4,"Informative, user friendly, and easily understood.",As a newly diagnosed diabetic I needed to learn as much about diabetes as I could. This book did the trick and was fun to read. The helpful hints in the shaded areas on many of the pages pushed home the important concepts to be remembered.There weren't a lot of complex ideas that needed head scratching and rereading to understand. Things were explained in a simple manner that made sense and were easy to conceptualize.I would definately suggest this book to anyone needing to take care of themselves or someone they love.
5,Words rarely fail me,"And they don't even when they should. In this case there should be no superlatives fit for this album, but truly this album is one of magnificence in simplicity.My personal favourite is the opening track because being overseas and missing my home town...well it just the the most vivid imagery of St Kilda. Almost brings a tear to the eye. This is a must for anyone who enjoys the acoustic and the gorgeous noise one can make from playing it so quiet."
3,Intoglow does not work..........,"It's a nice watch...Sure wish the ""light up"" feature worked on this watch. Will give it time at the beach this summer to see if it really holds up!"
2,ehh ...,Although the price & appearance seem pretty good ... I say 'ehhh'.1st one I got leaked in 5 ft of water. The company sent a replacement ... and the metal edges were very sharp (unpolished) ... so I do not recommend this watch.
4,A comprehensive resource guide that is easy to use.,"An experienced practitioner will find this resource book easy to use. It is very well organized, making it easy to spot interventions that are relevant to a particular organization or client engagement. It offers an extensive menu of approaches to consider, as well as what appears to be a comprehensive list of resources and references that will provide more detailed information. For one who does not have time to keep up with all the literature, this is a valuable resource.In addition, many of the chapters have samples, models and other useful exhibits that convey a lot of information as well as provide good summaries of the approaches offered. Managers and others who are considering how they want to develop their organizations would find these useful."
4,What a great way to expand your own toolset.,"I've been in the performance improvement world for 15 years and found the book a wonderful way to expand my knowledge beyond my set of experiences. I especially loved the case studies with the positive and negative examples. As someone who helps other performance technologists around the country, I will certainly recommend this as a great way to get the big picture do's and don'ts for an impressive number of tools."
1,Dinosaur Chess is a Dinosaur,Dinosaur Chess will not properly load or work completely with any operating system newer than Windows XP. This product has not been up-dated.
3,Chess on my Own !,GREAT resource - but it would not download on three computers that we have at home and in my classroom... Newest model with Windows 7 XP - did the trick - Kids love it - and so do I ... I'm learning right along with them !
5,Best cleanser at a great price,"I really love this cleanser it is quick & efficient & not drying I bought it first in new York whilst visiting my son I am very sorry it is not sold in the u k , although I bought it at a really good price from amazon. I must say too that it removes make up well."
3,Where's the Foam?,"The word ""Foaming"" in the label is misleading as there is no more (maybe even less) foaming action to it than the average liquid soap. Three stars because I normally trust Neutrogena and have no reason to believe it's not a good product otherwise, I'd be interested in a foaming version if/when they come up with one."
3,Burns your eyes,It says you can use it to remove eye makeup but I haven't been able to do so without it bothering my eyes. I thought I could use this to replace eye makeup remover. It's okay for my face but I probably won't purchase this again.
5,face wash,This is one of the best makeup remover/cleansers I have tried. It even removes mascara and heavy eyeliner. Good for dry skin too.
2,Not for me,"Been using this for awhile now because I refuse to waste it. My skin type: combination dry/oily areas/fair/sensitive/acne-prone. This face wash drys my skin out terribly. I hate that tight dry feeling I get after using it. Sure I feel like it is taking the makeup off, but at the loss of all my skins natural oils and moisture which it really really needs! Lately my skin has been so dry and flaky so along with the colder weather and dry indoor heat this stuff is wrecking my skin! I hate it. Definitely does nothing to clear my acne, if anything it makes it worse. I will not be repurchasing this product."
5,"Surprisingly Gentle, Super Effective","I must admit, I was a little concerned about this face wash (it came with the anti-wrinkle kit including the eye cream and day creme). I really didn't want the wash because it isn't fragrance free and I was worried it would sting or dry my sensitive skin out.I was pleasantly surprised! Not only did it NOT even irritate my eyes, I can get it all around my eyes and wherever to get eye make-up off, plus anything else on my face (powders, cremes, blush, pollution, etc.) and NO stinging or drying at all.What a great multi-purpose product at an amazingly low price. I had bought the rather expensive Peter Thomas Roth daily cleanser, which was gentle but so $$$ and could not be purchased near me conveniently without paying full price. I loved it, but knew it wasn't practical.Bottom line? Found my happy solution in Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser!"
2,Smells Horrible!,Did not like this product. Smells awful and it after using it I did not get that fresh clean feeling.
3,"Wet dog smell, stings eyes",I am trying lots of cleansers for their ability to take off eye makeup without stinging the eyes. I also happen to like a nice fresh smell; not real sensitive to that. This fails on all three counts.
4,okay,"Been using this cleanser one a day for over a month. Works ok- still get breakouts, but nothing really major since using this. Shipping was quick."
4,Graphite powder,I bought this to lube a Marlin model sixty. It works OK but use it sparingly. Of course for it's intended purpose which is lubing lock sets it is wonderful stuff.
3,"It's ok, wish it was cheaper and bigger","I used this product on my garage door hinges. It seems to work good for metal on metal. You hear good things about graphite powder as a good lubricant that doesn't attract dirt like grease & oil. But it doesn't penetrate as good as a liquid. I also don't think the squeeze bottle is the best way to dispense the graphite powder, you end up using too much or too little and it gets on everything. I'm happy with this product so far but the bottle is so small I ordered 2 of them. These seem to be somewhat hard to find in local stores, so I'm glad Amazon carries it."
1,Disappointed!,I was very disappointed in this set. One pair was very loose in the crotch to begin with and a second pair became loose in the crotch after just a few times of wearing and washing.
5,Hanes Brief review.,"I will keep this brief. The product is just as I expected; fit and comfort exactly right. Color immaterial, as I don't wander around in my underwear. The main benefits of shopping with Amazon are the fact that I do not have to GO Shopping! I know when I need something and I simply turn to Amazon, find the item and click it and forget it! In a very short period of time, the product arrives and the deal is done. I like it!"
3,Not quite what the picture indicated,"We expected the pack to have three different colored briefs- all three were the same shade of blue. No big deal, the functionality and quality are still good."
4,Great but case doesnt last,"I got this a while ago. The Potato Heads are great, but plan on finding something else to store the parts in. My Daughter ruined the case in 3 weeks. We now have them in a large bag."
4,"Interesting historically -- and yummy recipes, too","I thoroughly enjoyed this book - has lots of interesting facts about southern food and history. Many of the recipes sound scrumptious, too.Recommend for anyone who is interested in southern food and culture."
4,weight matched for easy handling,"It may be odd , but the handles seem weight matched to the rest of the cookware. I am pleased with the purchase. I found that my sister has a set like it only she preferred stainless."
4,Emeril pans,Emeril pans are good pans. I use them daily. The frying pans do not last as long as I would have expected. After approx one year usage they start to stick and I have to throw them away. That is the reason for only four stars and not five!
5,Great for the money!,"I love this cookware!! Got it for Christmas and use it every day. It looks great, cleans up with ease and the food cooks faster! Pan/pots stay flat on my flat cooktop and the see through lids make cooking a lot easier."
4,Emerilware,"So far I am very happy with the Emerilware that I purchased, I have had no problems with it."
3,"Okay but, not great","Emerilware Hard Anadized non-stick is attractive and seems fairly durable. Browning is similar to any non stick pan. You won't get as nice a sear with non-stick as you would with a metal surface. I have many pieces of the discontinued Calphalon Commercial (both anodized and non-stick) which I think is 5 stars. By comparison, Emerilware is less expensive and lighter. My reason for only 3 stars is the handle. If you are not careful, the first time you use them you can get a rude awakening. The heat travels about half way up the handles. This occured while cooking eggs over low heat. I would hate to have grabbed it unawares if I was doing a sear. Not the case for the Calphalon ""Cool-V"" handles. But for the handles, I'd give it 4 stars."
4,"great pots, lousy lids","I cook all the time, and these pots are great with the exception of the lids. The pots are truly non-stick and easy to clean. However, the lids have a seam between the glass and the metal frame. Whenever you take the lid off a steaming pot, the condensation drips through the seam and makes a mess. Even worse, food gets stuck in the seam and you cannot clean it. I regret the purchase."
2,new pan set,"My husband and I chose this set because we wanted to get a healthier cooking set for our family. We both love the set. We have only had it for two weeks but have been very happy with the pieces. As written before the handles do get hot--they are not covered with a heat resistant material. I expected that. We cannot put them in the dishwasher, which I prefer and they still wash very easily. Yes, food gets stuck around the handle rivets--I would rather have that than handles that are merely welded on and fall off easily. Wanting to keep the pans for more than a year, we only own wooden spoons and plastic spatulas. Tonight while washing the skillet, my husband noticed there are the beginnings of scratches on the bottom. Considering how careful we are--these were an expensive purchase for us--we are shocked. If these are going to scratch that easily, I don't know what we did wrong, we're going to return them and get the same thing but the Costco brand at a much lower cost."
3,Lovely for a Little While,"My husband gave this to me for Mother's Day when I was pregnant with our first child. It was such a lovely ring and wonderful gift. I have worn it every day all day for nearly 2 years and it still looks great! The picture definitely does not do the stone justice; it's a really pretty shimmery color that picks up and reflects purple, blue, pink and a hint of yellow. The MOM engraving is tasteful versus tacky. The 2 little diamonds on either side of the topaz are trivial and not really a focal point of the ring. *UPDATE* The main stone fell out when it was about 2.5 years old. Guess it's back to the drawing board:P"
3,pool hustlers stories,"A really neat book for me because I had met and watched the players. Interesting stories of a long gone era, one I miss. Well written and easy to follow."
4,Wanted to be a professional like these guys!,This is a great book for all the baby boomers out there that loved to play pool (pocket billiards). The book explains where the word pool comes from. Anybody that wants to know the history of the early days should read this book! Really anybody with a interest in pool should read it.Buy and enjoy. I know I did.
2,AND WHAT A HUSTLE IT IS!,GREAT SUBJECT.GREAT PERSONALITIES.TERRIBLE BOOK.TERRIBLE WRITING.ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A GOOD IDEA FOR A BOOK GONE COMPLETLY SOUR.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
5,Johnson City 1962,"This book is outstanding! It garners that rating because it accurately depicts the character and lifestyle of the three spot-lighted players. I know; I played Wimpy and the Squirrel in 1962 in Johnson City. I wasn't in the tournament per se, ( I had a real job) but came down on one weekend from Chicago with other Bensinger and 20th Century players ( Youngblood, Mexican Johnny, and Billy the Kid) for the action. I saw Fats there but never saw him play. He was side-betting and looking for prop plays. I saw Jersey Red at 20th Century in either the fall of '63 or '64, I can't pinpoint which. I'm ""Inky""."
2,Like White Bread,I love Sesame seeds and Whole Grain Rye. This is however all Wheat flour and tastes like white bread. It is also a smaller 7 oz instead of 9.8 oz.Less of an inferior product. Notice it is manufactured in Germany and not Sweden.
4,Crunchy and delicious,Great crackers for a snack. Could do with more sesame seeds. I understand there is a shortage of sesame seeds this year.
5,Best Bread on the planet,"I was first introduced to Wasa Sesame Crispbread in Sweden last year, and when I came home to the US found them online and ordered a case. My wife has Croan's disease and has a hard time eating any bread products and is able to have these with no ill effects. This is not only my favorite bread now but also my wife's, and 1 year old granddaughters. These are excellent with meats, cheese and most every dip we have tried . We have tried the other Wasa crackers and have found them to be just so-so. The Sesame crackers are always in demand and will keep ordering cases."
3,flimsy,really flimsy and missing the needle to blow up the balls. the horse shoes are just plastic. we liked the one we got at walmart better.
4,Great Variety,"This was a Christmas gift for the kids. Great variety, but a everything is plastic. I'm not sure how long the net will stay up when the older kids use it, but if they enjoy the games enough we'll buy a better quality set."
1,More than 400 USD for a rubber strap??,"This has to be the joke of the year, right? More than 400 USD for a rubber strap. And this is even the cheap one - there is a blue rubber band for 675 USD!! After paying more than 4000 USD for the watch, they should be throwing this bands at for free - for life!"
3,"Solid, if Somewhat Disappointing","I read this book after playing Call of Duty: World at War which contains battles that take place on Peleliu. Wikipedia indicated that Peleliu was the scene for one of the most difficult battles in WWII history and so it piqued my interest. After completing this book, I left somewhat disappointed. The book is clearly well researched and I actually like the pains the author takes to be ""fair"" with regards to not being a Japan bashing tome. But overall, I left without any particular takeaways after reading it."
2,Misleading Title,"The labelling for this CD reads:Electric Light Orchestra Greatest Hits Live, Part II:The Encore CollectionIf it readElectric Light Orchestra, Part II Greatest Hits Live:The Encore CollectionThere would have been no confusion. I was expected the Jeff Lynne version of ELO when I picked this up. As soon as I heard the first vocal, I knew I'd been had. I would only recommend this to diehard ELO fans who want to hear different live versions of ELO classics.If you like ELO Part II, then you may be satisfied with this disc. Personally I only like Jeff Lynne on vocals so I give this disc:1 star for misleading labelling3 stars for satisfactory performance.End 2 stars."
3,not too bad,"The title is misleading,unless you've already listened to some of part2's music.Eric Troyer can sing if he will just take the clothespin off his nose.Seriously,I've listened to part2 in every version I could find.There are only 2 songs of their own that I really like,and if you are like me,you'd rather hear the studio versions than live.Those 2 songs are ""Honest Men"" and ""One More Tomorrow"",the one that's included here and I believe it to be their masterpiece.But Jeff Lynne this isn't even though I suspect he gets a cut of the profits just the same:he's a shrewd businessman.If you want to hear part 2 at their best look for studio work,not live."
4,Good....But not Great,"I bought this cd a couple monts ago and have only listened to it once since. Mabey its just the fact that these songs are live and lose some of the more important ELO factors. You can't here many of their instruments and that takes away from this cd. I got it for 5$(new) at my local hastings and didn't know it was live until I popped it in my CD player. But still this is ELO(to me the best band of the 70's) so it was still worth it. I just don't think I would have spent more than that on it.This includes alot of their classics including my personal favorite ""Livin' Thing"""
4,A must for living in the city,"Pure and simple: If you live in a large city and have stairs, this is an easy decision. The carrier is light, compact, and easy to use on city streets and mildly bumpy areas.Although this has been a good purchase, it's not perfect. I am somewhat leary that the car seat isn't securely fastened enough. I don't know what would happen if we accidentally jolted the carrier or went over a bigger than anticipated curb. Unlike most strollers, the car seat carrier doesn't lock the car seat. I think they could make some modest modifications, which would ""lock"" the seat and carrier."
4,Unique item,"I have looked for many lightweight strollers for NY subways and buses, and only found this product. I'm wondering if anyone can confirm for me that it is compatible with the Graco Snug Ride LATCH Blackwell? That's the car seat I ordered."
2,Not safe for Graco snugride car seat,"I agree with a reviewer about the Graco snug ride car seat. I'm a fairly competant person, and read the instructions with great care... and as far as I can tell, there is no ""snapping"" with this car seat and this frame. The car seat just rests on top of the frame and you have to rely on the flimsy little strap to keep the car seat in. That's fine for level sidewalks, but not much else. I love how easy this is to fold and store in the trunk, but am I doing something wrong? Is there a piece missing?"
1,Useful Alternative,"As I have already written a real review for this item stating how displeased I was with it's compatability with Graco products I won't go any further with that.What I did want to let people know is that Graco has just come out with a new product called the Snug Rider. It is an alternative to the snap n go that is made specifically for Graco products. I LOVE IT. I am so impressed with how sturdy it is. Please people, if you own a Graco snugride consider this before the snap n go. Trust me you will llove it too. I can pick up the whole system from the one handle and not feel as though my baby is going to fall. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find the product on the Babies R Us website. They are carrying it in stores though. Good Luck :)"
2,"Graco Snug Ride does not ""snap"" in????","We bought this stroller last night and just like a review on Jan 30. have found that the Graco Snug Ride does not ""snap"" into place securely... there is about 2-3 inches of play and you can actually remove the seat without using the red handle to depress the lock!? With the safety strap in place, it seems to be stable enough but we are perplexed by the amount of ""play"" in the fit. And yes, we have read the directions a dozen times and are confident that all the bars, etc. are in the proper place as the directions are very clear and everything is labled as well. We really like the concept of this stroller and love it otherwise, just aren't sure how safe it is with the fit."
1,Not for SnugRide,Don't bother wasting your money if you have the SnugRide by Graco.Graco now sells a frame called the SnugRider Infant Carseat Frame. You can find it here by name for whatever reason.You can find it by searching for the part number B0007KMUH4.
3,Snap-N-Go LX by Swan is better for Graco Snugride,"I tried out the Baby Trend Snap 'N Go with the Graco Snugride that we got and never got the bars to fit right, even after trying to reconfigure the bar. I gave up and ordered a similar carseat carrier made by Swan off the internet. The price is just a hair higher, but I found that with the Graco Snugride, the fit is great. It took me just a few minutes to put together the Swan brand one. Also I found the Swan Snap-n-Go LX to be made of more sturdy material and just as light."
5,Do not buy big bulky strollers for an infant,"This is the best thing for transporting infants. The first time i got the car seat/stroller set and I got into a huge fight with the stroller everytime i had to put it in the trunk. Forget about fitting in the isles of the supermarket, pharmacy or mall. This one is the best, with one hand i can unfold it and put it in the car. Use the strap for security."
4,"Great stroller frame, bad cup holder","This stroller frame is a great product. It is very easy to unfold and fold with one hand. It handles very smoothly on bumps and brick paths. The one negative is the cup holders are too shallow. I had a hot cider that spilled on the baby's blanket thank god, and not her skin. So beware of putting any drink without a secure cap in the cup holder."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!","My son is 2 now, but I have a couple friends with upcoming showers and this instantly came to mind for both. Having had a c-section, the first couple weeks were a little tough and this was so easy to open and operate. I can't imagine having gone without it. I Highly recommend it."
5,I LOVE THIS STROLLER,"Being a first time mom, I thought it was imperative to own an expensive travel system. I'm glad I didn't waste the money. Most experienced Mom's will tell you that they really don't care for the travel systems because they are so bulky and heavy. The Snap N Go is perfect. It's lightweight, maneuvers smoothly between aisles and narrow spaces, and it folds up with one hand. It's better than the lightest travel system. Once you try it, you will fall in love with it! Ask anyone who owns the Snap N Go."
3,Just OK,We purchased the Snap N Go to go with the Baby Trend Car Seat. The instructions were not so clear if you purchased the Baby Trend Car Seat. Also the long strap the makes sure the car seat does not fall off was too short. I had to call Baby Trend for another strap. They were not very friendly. Overall the Snap N Go is working for us.
3,Navy Blue and some assembly required.,"Once I recieved the carrier the first thing I noticed was that is was navy blue. The picture that I looked at seem to me to be black. When I called the Baby Trend company they informed me that they could not garentee that I would recieve a black one even if I sent it back. Being color isn't everything, I was still excied because it's light weight and easy to move baby, I started to put it together. My husband is in the military and is not around to help me put things together right now, so being 33 weeks pregnant I still havn't been able to get our Snug Ride car seat to snap on. This may be do to my own errors but I don't really have much of a choice but to send it back if I want to have a stroller for when our baby arrives."
4,don't register for anything else!!! this is what you'll need,"This item is worth every penny!!! Have it w/ the graco snap n go and it really is fantastic!!! there's no need to buy any other stroller until they get too big for their carrier...really easy to use, cart in and out of the car, not too heavy...only drama was the poorly written instructions and a little plastic part was broken when we got it, but it assembled nicely...just take your time and you'll get it together..."
4,"Easy, light",It is very convenient. unfortunately I use it only for 4 months because my son outgrew his infant seat. the only thing i did not like was the cup holder.
3,Horrible instructions,"We're using the Snap 'N Go with an Evenflo On My Way car seat. The assembly instructions are horrible, especially the part that deals with the snap bar. There's a nice table that provides the values for three parameters for each car seat, but then the instructions do not refer to those three parameters. And moving the snap bar from its factory-installed position to one of the other 4 positions is not an easy task."
2,Zata,"This stroller has nothing to attach the car seat to beside a simple strap with a buckle. After I realized it, I returned this stroller and bought the Greco Quattro, which has many more features to offer."
2,Beware of Car Seat Compatibility,"I was given an Evenflo Discovery Infant Car seat as a gift and was under the impression that it would work with the Snap N Go-- after all, the product claims to be compatible with Evenflo seats. It doesn't work, not only that, the chart that indicates which models are compatible is located near the end of the instruciton manual--AFTER the assembly instructions. So, now I have a fully assembled Snap N Go (I can't return) that won't work with my car seat.My advice? Call the Baby Trend customer service number (800-328-7363) before buying this product to make sure that your car seat will work!"
5,absolute must-have,"This is one of the best purchases we made with our first child. Still going strong after 3 babies! Lightweight, folds flat easily with one hand, very sturdy. Great if you are in & out of the car a lot - doesn't wake the baby. This stroller has been everywhere with us (beach, park, store, school, airport, etc). Highly recommended."
4,Great product !!,"I would highly recommend this product! It is light weight for those who have back problems, and SUPER easy to use! Folds easily and is very compact! The only thing i dont like is the basket. We have a Graco carrier, and when placed in the Snap N Go, the basket is blocked! You'd have to lift the carrier out of the way to get to the contents in the basket - What a hassle! Best thing to do is just to hang a diaper bag. The cup holders are great though. All in all, the product is still worth having and the price is very reasonable."
1,Do Not use with Graco Snug Ride!!!,"Despite claiming their product is compatible with Graco's Snug Ride, the GSR just sits on a metal bar and relies on a strap to hold the whole thing together. Frightening for a parent to rely on. Very poor instructions and even worse customer support. When I called to express my concern that there seemed to be no ""snap"" in the snap n go, the person I spoke to even agreed that the product worked poorly with the Snug Ride. Friends with other car seats indicate their product works well with the Snap n Go, but why support a manufacturer that continues to claim their product works with the Snug Ride when it so clearly doesn't?"
5,Very awesome,"This stroller is so easy to use, I could even fold and unfold it when I was 9 months pregnant. Considering I'm a very small lady, and was in a lot of pain during the last part of my pregnancy (due to my huge baby), that's saying a LOT. My husband has been very impressed with this item as well. It turns easily, but the wheels are big enough not to get stuck in gravel or grass. Plus, I got to choose the carrier I wanted. I love not having a bulky stroller to push around or try to shove into the back of my small car. Definitely a great buy!"
3,Good with Reservations,"Yes, this base makes is lightweight, easy to use, and simple but one strong precaution - it only works well on smooth surfaces. I live in an older neighborhood whose sidewalks have lots of bumps, edges, and rises where tree roots have pushed the sidewalk up. If you try to go over these bumps and don't maneuver and lift the stroller correctly, the stroller jams and comes to a sudden halt. This can be dangerous because the force of you pushing the stroller can cause it to topple over. I have had two close calls and now have taking to walking on the edge of the street. So, if your sidewlks are smooth or you are going to the mall, it's fine, however, I can't wait until my baby is old enough to get a proper stroller that can handle rougher terrain."
5,SO EASY!!,"MY mother-in-law insisted on ths item for me. I was hesitant to stray from the traditional ""travel system"" as a first-time mom but boy am I glad I did! My friends are so jealous of how lightweight and maneuverable the snap and go is! You just adjust the bars to fit your car seat then you never adjust them again! It is very lightweight and folds and unfolds so quickly and easily! I highly recommend the snap and go instead of the travel system heavy strollers for when the baby is rear-facing, then graduate to an Umbella stroller for the forward-facing baby!"
3,A Necessity - But I wish there was a better one,"I like the Snap'N GO best out of all the universal car seat carriers/strollers.That said my car seat (the Graco) does not truly ""snap"" in. It is secure enough for quick trips - but I would never want to have to use this as my every day stroller. Also, I am sure someone else has already posted this, but the printed instructions that my Snap 'N Go came with had the wrong instructions for attaching the Graco. The Baby Trend web page has the correct directions that you can download. Even installed correctly, it is not that secure.But I still say this is a necessary product because those car seats are so heave to lug around, and this snap n' go is so light and stays nicely folded up in the back of the car.The cup holders also get a plus :)"
4,Nice little record!!,If you like canterbury prog rock you will probably love this as the music is composed in that particular vein of prog...(complex time changes yet accesible melodies and harmonies) . This also has a particular sound. Sort of Penguin Cafe Orchestra meets Phil Miller or late Gilgamesh. Also mid seventies Pekka Pohjola came to miind. Good and recommended (just like the label says!)
1,Rubbish,"This toasted sandwich maker only heat the bread wont toast it very thing comes out soggy,if any one can tell how to toast with this tell mepaul"
4,Memories,Watching this brought back memories of my childhood. Introducing the Thundcats to my children have insured bonding to be fun & meaningful.
5,Hammett's Best,"Above all of his other books, Red Harvest is the essential Hammett read. Dark, gritty, thought provoking and even humorous, this book delivers everything you could desire from a classic detective text. To not enjoy and appreciate this book is to dismiss the genre as a whole."
4,Vintage Noir,"This is vintage noir and Hammet at his best. However, that being said, David Goodis still rules the nest in this genre form...for while Hammet created the form and excelled at it...Goodis took it a step farther, elevating the form from being about detection to the dark gravel that exists in the grime of the human spirit..."
3,ultimately an ordinary gangland crime novel..,"'Red Harvest' starts off so well, much like a Raymond Chandler novel. A man is murdered under strange circumstances, with his intriguingly strange family members being either suspects or wanting revenge. In waltzes a private investigator, ala Philip Marlowe, who seems tough, street-wise, and does well with the ladies. Oh, and the lingo throughout is very 1930s tough guy talk. However 'Red Harvest' ultimately sinks into mediocrity. Why?Firstly, Dashiell Hammett spins an overly complex story with way too many characters ... into what is a very short book. Too many killings, too much action, very little coherence. While the story sort of pulls itself together in the end I find myself ultimately bored, and disappointed, with the entire effort.Bottom line: not an enjoyable reading experience."
1,Disappointing,While this novel may have an important place in the history of crime fiction it is simply an awful read. The plot is convoluted and the violence is over the top. If you were going to read only one Dashiell Hammett novel please make it The Maltese Falcon which I have read over and over.
5,Great Read,Hammett at his best. I have just begun to read Hammett and this was a real delight to read. The Op is a great character.
5,Dang can Dashiel Hammet write!,"Red Harvest inspired a number of movies and is a classic story of one man versus an entire crooked town. It twists and turns like nobodies business! If you like hard boiled, if like noir, this is required reading."
5,I LOVE This Book,"Bookstore shelves are full of Apologetic writings trying to prove stories in the Bible are literally true. If that's what you are looking for, get another book. What the Bible Really Says is thought-provoking, appealing to the intellect of the beliver. Yet the book is surprisingly readable.As we journey through the Old and New Testaments, Barthel digs through the controversial stories in the Bible and the similar myths in ancient religions without ever questioning the authority of the Scriptures. He constantly shows us that the Bible is more than a collection of Sunday school stories, but he never leads us to question our faith.Highly recommended!"
3,"Ok, not great","This book does not contain many true recipes for a bread maker. It has one chapter devoted to bread maker recipes, 31 in the chapter, but not as many ""everyday"" type breads like I was hoping for. The other chapters contain ""variations"" on how to use the recipes in a machine, but I haven't tried any of those yet. The recipes from the machine chapter I tried were all dry and kind of tasteless, not impressive at all, really. I'm still new at this, and I could have done something wrong, but, who knows. I will keep trying but I was just hoping the breads would be soft, moist in a way, usable for sandwiches, etc...I ended up using the breads for making breadcrumbs and stuffing since they were dry and stale-like in texture. They were perfect for that!"
1,Get this book at Amazon.co.uk instead!,"The book offered on the US Amazon uses volume instead of weight. This is a very inaccurate way of baking. Things will come out too dry or too soggy because a cup of flour can be too densely packed or too fluffy. Weighing will always be more consistent, so get baking books from the UK and buy yourself a decent inexpensive digital scale."
2,Not what I thought,It's my own fault for not checking the size of this book before I bought it. I was hoping for a usuable cook book but this is more like a coffee table decoration. Fortunatly this is a gift from my 5 yr old and this person has coffee table-type books lying around. The pictures are all like charcoal sketches. It's ok but I probably wouldn't spend $10 again.
3,A mixture of good and bad,"You get four cartoons:Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor (D. Fleischer), Ancient Fistory, Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba's Forty Theives (D. Fleischer), Cookin' with GagsThe two Dave Fleischer-directed cartoons are classics, and Jack Mercer's (voice of Popeye) mutterings are hilarious. I didn't care for Ancient Fistory and Cookin' with Gags - too much slpastick without a good supporting script.The scene selection menu is pretty good - all four cartoons appear in animated frames, and Popeye zooms around the menu on camelback!The video transfer is mediocre and probably limited by the source material. There's a good bit of jumpiness in the frame and I noticed some digital artifacting in certain scenes.Worth having just to say you have Popeye on DVD."
2,"Buy this for the History, not the Quality","I was very unhappy with the Tech Quality of this DVD. The master they used for the ""Popeye meets Sinbad the Sailor"" short was very bad. It almost looks like they found the film in someones basement.If you want to see some history making animation this might be worth the $10 but don't expect any better quality that you get on TV.I give it 0 stars for the quality and 2 for the animation history."
3,"Great album, vinyl not in top condition",Unfortunately this vinyl record did not arrive in the condition I thought it would be in. Feel somewhat mislead by condition.
5,a stone cold classic,"I admit I got into the B-52's around '89 when Cosmic Thing came out. Loved that record so much (well, actually, i bought it on cassette). Then the inevitable happened, I had played Cosmic Thing out big time. Time to go find more B-52s, so I bought this album along with their sophmore effort, Wild Planet. This album is stronger than the aformentioned two releases. Best songs are: 6060842, Lava, Dance This Mess Around and the classic Rock Lobster."
4,Great Album,CD was great. Too bad it has taken me so long to update my cd collection. A must for every 80's-90's fanatic.
4,Ladies disappear,"The B 52's-52's BI arrived in London in 1979 for the first time to see Todd Rundgren / Utopia at the Knebworth Festival, and in every street I turned I saw a lot of posters with this bizarre group, which reminded me of the 50s. What a stupid record I thought, and it must suck hard.I wonder why then arrived home, after 6 months I bought B52's and I fell in love, I found them innovative and I followed them in many stages of their careers,still today ............Never say never"
5,Another great story,"L'Amour does it again. Not only a captivating, well-written story but he shares a bit of history from the physical location of the story. Much overlooked, L'Amour is a tremendous writer who can create character, plot and drama in an efficient and exciting way."
3,I Enjoy L'Amour,"Good L'Amour read, makes some very enlightening points about what was lost when the First Nation (native americans) peoples were taken from the land. Great story telling between good and bad without preachy-ness."
5,"Westward the Tide, L'Amour","Very good reading. All of Louis L'Amour books make for good reading. It's a western murder mystery, well written. Could not put the book down. Intend to order more of L'Amour's books. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,"Thin soup, decent flavor","This soup was much thinner than I expected. I also agree about the lack of a visible expiration date, although with dried beans and spices the worst result would be blandness. Fair value for what was received, but not worth buying again."
1,amazon purchase,"the thermometer came with a reading of 100 degrees, that did not change even after putting it in the refrigerator in cold water. I asked for an exchange , the 2nd one was ALSO stuck on 100 degrees and did not read an accurate temp. would not buy that type again."
2,Average Advice,I guess I was expecting more from this book. I didn't get a lot out of it other than standard journal-writing advice like using free association and looking back at older journals for patterns. The author seemed more concerned with working out her own problems with writing by putting a lot of her own entries into this book. I can't think of a single thing that I will use from this book in my own journaling.
3,Really easy!,"If you like those old-fashioned Tetris rip-off games like Doctor Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine or Doctor Mario then you'll probably like Meteos (a pretty lame title) but I finished playing it re-eally quickly and I wouldn't recommend buying it. Just rent it.There's really nothing that new about the gameplay either. If you've played any one of the above mentioned games then you pretty much know what's in-store for you as it's almost exactly the same only with a nonsensical, who-REALLY-cares story behind it and some touch-screen interaction. Despite the colorful graphics and the fancy bells and whistles this is old-fashioned stuff and doesn't show off the Nintendo DS to it's full potential. I wouldn't recommend using this as a demonstration game to those unconvinced by the DS coolness.Graphics B+Sound B+Gameplay CLasting Appeal D"
5,Absolutley Delightful,"One of the greatest games i have ever played. Addictive and very very quirky. From the creator of the amazing game Lumines, how bad can this game really be? Let me start by saying, im not too avid at puzzle games. As a matter of fact i tend to hate them. But this one instantly hooked me with its cleverness and unique style. I urge you to go to a DS download station and try this game more than once, because at first it seems stupid, but then you are hooked. Trust me. I havent gotten a chance to play multiplayer with real people yet, but playing against the computer is simply amazing. My DS lite has never been more fun to play."
3,Why is it rated so highly?,"I bought this game strictly because of the awesome reviews I have read about it. When I got it and popped it into my DS I was slightly disappointed. The story mode is absolutely useless. There are 3 modes where you travel to different planets, but it's generally all the same thing. There is nothing motivating you to keep going. I enjoyed playing against my friend who owns a DS, but other then that, this game doesn't really hold it's own. I tend to gravitate toward puzzle games that have story lines like 7 Wonders of the Ancient World. I am a huge puzzle fan and Meteos just doesn't hold it's own in my opinion. The graphics and sounds are cute though. Not horrible, just not the best."
4,Over-rated,"This game is a puzzle game. I personally feel that the reviews are too over-rated for what it's worth. It's kind of like Bejeweled except you can only line up blocks vertically, and not horizontally, which kind of bothers me. There's not really a storyline ... it's not incredibly fun, but will probably last you a fairly good ten minutes of game play. It's really the effects when you line up the same colored blocks and the sounds and graphics that give you that ""high"" of the game."
3,Uncertainty remains,"It is a well researched peace of work, but that is unfortunately all that I can say about it. My questain remains: What does the Bible say regarding the topic? We cannot weight biblical prophecy on a historical scale. I still believe there is more Biblical evidence for a Pre-trib rapture than a Post-trib (and I am not a dispensationalist)."
1,Too much obsolete information!,"Everything here was written before the actual Gigabit Ethernet we use today was finished,, so this book is just too old to be of much use today. Most of the technical facts are about things that might have been, rather than about things that are.This would have been a great book in it's day, and a re-write in the same style describing Gigabit Ethernet as it is actually implemented would be much appreciated."
1,AOLtv? why bother,"having been a WEBtv user for a couple of years I thought I'd take a shot at AOLtv.An usb port,to send pics and such over E-mail.Oh, not so. Bwana!!! Turns out you can't send anything to the box.Seems to me search engines are woefully lacking.Expect my new WEBtvPlus box soon,where i can everthing as advertised"
1,AOL Wont let you connect to tis service.,"I just received a new one (to me) in boxbut AOL tells me I cannot use this setas they no longer are available for this service?So I guess its absolutely worthless, I cant even sell it if I wanted.!Too bad, it is brand new in box never used......AndI guess it wont be.Nce gift.......NOT.!"
2,pretty bad,It took to long and the book has liquidation damage and highlights not like new. Price was good though. Customer dissatisfied.
1,"Reveiw on ""Behavior Modification, What it is and how to do""","I am a student at Ohio University and I have had the unpleasant experience of having to use this particular book for 3 quarters now and I absolutely hate it I think it is the most ambiguous mess I have ever seen it is confusing and redundant. My professor who is using the book for this term is now dropping the book also! He feels the same as myself and all of the students who have had to endure this book. I am so glad future students will not have to struggle with this in the future....by the way I was a 4.0 student until this particular class and the use of this book my average has now dropped to a 3.8. I am a straight A student in EVERY other aspect of my college career. I will bring my average back to the 4.0 I am used, to with no thanks to this book and its rediculous content."
1,Save your money,"A badly written historical romance trying to disguise itself as an historical novel. Ellen James takes a defining moment in English history--the struggle between Maude of Germany and Stephen of Blois for the English throne--and turns it into a love story, even implying that Maude's son Henry was fathered by Stephen and not her husband Geoffrey of Anjou! Readers who know nothing of history may enjoy this, but for a much better overview of these events read Sharon Kay Penman's ""When Christ and His Saints Slept."""
3,Lacks depth,"I bought the book because the table of contents showed that the book covered the topics comprehensively. However, there is a serious lack of depth. I think the book is good for students who are just learning about linux and embedded systems, but not as useful for the more serious and experienced developer."
5,How Much Is Enough?,"This book is amazing. Something here for every parent, grandparent, educator, employer, etc.I was impressed with this research driven book. It contains countless interviews and real-life situations. The stories tell great lessons.I see this as a window into the family dynamics of many children today.I experienced self evaluation and a greater understanding of people I encounter in my daily life.Worth every penny...buy it. emk."
5,An ideal instruction manual and guide,"The collaborative and very highly recommended work of parenting experts Jean Illsley Clarke, Connie Dawson, and David Bredehoft, How Much Is Enough?: Everything You Need To Know To Steer Clear Of Overindulgence And Raise Likeable, Responsible And Respectful Children From Toddlers To Teens is an ideal instruction manual and guide for anyone wanting to establish firm and fair rules and structures for their children at each stage of their childhood development. Of special utility is the advice on what to do when friends or family (especially doting grandparents!) overindulge the children. There's even counseling on how to break a generational cycle when the parent was overindulged as a child."
5,Necessary information for effective parenting,"My first impulse is to say ""yes"" to my kids when they ask. I thought that was part of what being a parent was about. I want them to have fun, I want them to be happy, but I also want them to be functional, competent adults. This book gives me the information I need to be able to say ""no"" and have it stick, to establish boundaries, lay out expectations, and reward appropriate behaviors. Now I know that doing so gives my children what they need, not simply what they want. I think all parents should have a copy of this book. It is so very useful, and written in a way that does not blame, but shares information."
5,Overindulgence: a plague on our society.,"I have found this book to be extremely practical in its application to everyday life, both as a parent and beginning-therapist. It provides readers simple ways to identify overindulgence and methods for avoiding or overcoming it. This is a must-have for parents who believe that children benefit from clear boundaries. WARNING: it may cause you to rethink your parenting style and increase self-awareness! :) More work from these authors on the subject matter is requested."
4,The introduction of three great voices,"Peter Paul and Mary (Warner Brothers): This CD is a delight. Here is where we were introduced to three great voices and the selections of songs are very good. Here is a mixture of classic Folk songs and the ""New"" Folk songs. The early 60's Folk revival is in full bloom here."
5,Ageless Perfection,"I was 14 when this album came out, and I remember that it was the only thing I wanted for Christmas. I recall putting it on my record player, and dancing around the house in total ecstasy, singing along with the harmonies.Today, Mary died. My heart is so heavy, my memories so full of this wonderful group and all the years of happiness and enlightenment they have given me.This is the best album--so fresh, so vibrant, so full of heart. I'm playing it now, as the tears cascade down my cheeks. I was shaped and fashioned by this music, and so very much of who I am today as a person is because of the impact and conscience PP&M; gave me."
1,Very Disappointed,"The music and songs are great except on every song, the recording stops before the song (and/or music is finished) and after paying almost $19.00, I am not very satisfied with the recording."
4,Pretty Good First Effort,"Overall, I enjoyed this book, from the setting in a small coastal town, to the memorable characters who live there. I was, however, surprised that at times the writing struck me as a bit mundane. Some descriptions were rather repetitive or unimaginative, and some of the things that the characters said almost made me roll my eyes and think, "" Oh, please! "". I was also a bit disappointed that many issues were left unresolved, such as the fact that Sara never did tell her birth mother, whom she became friends with, who she really was. Obviously, this leaves the door open for the sequel, which I do intend to read. The people are interesting and mostly likable, and you want to get to know them better. But I would like to see the writing become a bit more original and imaginative. Still, this is a pretty good first effort, and I look forward to more from Kinkade and Spencer."
4,Cape Light,"This book was a very enjoyable reading book. I love getting to know all the people in this little town. Like so many of us, they have secret lives. Makes you want to go there to meet these people. Was fast reading and keeps your interest. I am so glad we have authors that can write without using sex or violence."
1,More branded product masking as substance,Yet another offering from the Kinkade art product assembly line. Pass on this -- Read real books and buy real art instead.
5,Have read 3 so far...,I have read the first 3 books in this series and they are wonderful. I couldn't put them down and look forward to reading #4 soon.
1,Yuk my teeth hurt,"I would have given this zero stars, but Amazon's system doesn't work that way.I suppose there are people who are happy to make Kinkade rich off their hard earned money, because he certainly isn't working very hard for his. It's like the book was written with a Thesaurus -- let's look up different ways to say exactly the same thing over and over and over.I'm glad I didn't pay for this, but sorry that someone else did."
2,This is not Jan Karon,"This book came highly recommended and was extremely disappointing. It was obviously written with the idea of sequels in mind - there were just too many unresolved issues at the end - all waiting for another book. I don't t hink Mr. Kinkade probably wrote this book but leant his name to it. He should stick to his mediocre paintings.I was expecting something more along the lines of Jan Karon's Mitford books and this doesn't even come close but it will sell well because people like his paintings. That makes no sense but it's my opinion. If I choose to read the next book in the series, I'll take it out of the library and not waste my money on it. In the meantime I'll wait for the next Jan Karon book to appear."
1,You can't judge a book by it's cover.,It really is true. You can't judge a book by it's cover. The cover of this book is very pretty. Thomas is a great painter. I would not however recommend him as an author. This book at best was predictable. I should have spent my time time napping because I kept falling asleep anyway.
1,"Look up the word ""dreck"" in the dictionary","...and you will find a picture of this book. We have been assaulted with Kincaid in every shopping mall in America and NOW he has a book? This is not even as good as his sycophantic paintings (which are really Hallmark cards on posterboard). I implore you to stop supporting this machine. It is robbing humanity of thought and reason. Besides, it is really poor writing."
3,Good Reading for a Rainy Day,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Jan Karon's ""Mitford"" series, which I have read twice, I decided to read the Cape Light books by Kinkade. I have read the first three and probably will read the sequels, mainly because they are clean books if nothing else. Like Mr. Kinkade's paintings, which are very predictable, so are the characters and the plots in Cape Light. When I read Jan Karon's Mitford series, all of which I own, the characters evolved until I was able to visualize them in my mind--not so with these books. There is too much repetition of phrases, often on the same page, and too little character and plot development. So you're wondering why I stayed with these through the first three books---hey, it's November and it's cold and rainy. And I didn't buy them, I got them at the library."
5,THE CAPE LIGHT SERIES,"THE CAPE LIGHT SERIES, I HAVE READ MOST OF THIS SERIES OF THE FAMILIES OF CAPE LIGHT AND HAVE ENJOYED EVERY ONE. THOMAS KINKADE WAS A GREAT AUTHOR."
5,Heart Capturing!,"Cape Light reminded me of my small home town when I once lived in New England. It was hard to read at first but past the first chapter I couldn't put it down. You almsost feel as if you know the characters. One of the best if not the best book I have ever read. The lead characters Jessica and Sam have a very powerful relationship that you can't wait to find out what happens. I love that it gives you a realistic story one that many can relate to in their own lives. Easy reading, but enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple realistic LOVE not LUST story. I also enjoyed the great deal of faith the small town had.A definite must read! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!"
3,Cape Light,"Gay issues? ...Come now, the young lady had a beautiful marriage with a man she adored. His death left her devastated and she has a ""secret"" from this marriage that has haunted her for years. She is not able to give herself to anyone most likely because of this issue. ...The book wasn't great, but enjoyable. A ""let's listen in on someone's everyday life"" type novel. It addresses tolerance, forgiveness and giving of one's self to friends and community."
5,A little slice of life in a small town,"Kincaid captures the slightly hidden lifestyle of a lesbian in search of a fulfilling life. That rascal is quite subtle, but I think everyone will get the ""real"" message from this painter of light. I highly recommend it to anyone needing a glimpse into ""another side of the light"" BRAVO!"
1,A non-reader originally from the Midwest.,"A horrible painter, an even worse writer. I can't believe this man exists, let alone gets published. In response to the reader in Florida who cannot spell ""merit"", let me just say that the midwest does not have the corner in bad taste. This coming from someone from the ""sophisticated enclaves"" of the Everglades - where trailers are king - who actually had to read a sentence of this book in order to write a review."
4,formulaic,"Book arrived timely and in the condition stated. However, I was disappointed to find it read very similarly to the first book in the new Angel Island series, The Inn at Angel Island. Basically, it's the same story-line with different characters and a few of the same ones woven in.I actually had purchased the remainder of the books in the Cape Light series at the same time because I'd enjoyed the first two books in the Angel Island series so much. Had I known at the time that these storylines were so similar, I likely would not have bothered with this series. Now that I'm invested, I am reading the Cape Light series despite the formulaic writing."
4,NOT a lesbian novel at all!,"I enjoyed this book a lot. The characters were interesting and real, and I felt like Cape Light was a place I'd like to live in. But the previous reviewer must be mistaken or maybe joking-- the mayor is an unmarried woman-- but there isn't the tiniest indication that she's a lesbian. What book was that reviewer reading?!? Anyway, I hope Kinkade writes more Cape Light books. This was a totally enjoyable read."
2,hard to grasp,"I love to read christian fiction but this was a bit disapointing. For the first time I actually wished that the main character, Jessica, would just go away. I mean I actually wanted to throw this book out a window a couple of times. I didn't even bother to finish it. And I don't think I would call this a christian faith based book. In fact it said in very broad terms that all you need to do is go to church and pray and everything will work out in the end. Not a single mention of the plan of Salvation, which christian faith is based on."
1,Very basic advice. Heavily geared towards women.,"The basic message of this book seemed to be: Rather than go to bars and sit around at home waiting, join activities you're interested in and just work expanding your social circle and having fun.This book was mainly just that one point and was rather uninsightful. It also felt very centered around the author's own experiences and very targeted to a certain type of women. It was totally useless to me and I would expect it would be the same to most other men as well."
1,Pass on this,"I ordered this book and ""The Temptations of the Single Girl"" also by Nina Atwood. Well, do yourself a favor and just get the other book, which is fantastic. This book was written by the author ages ago and contradicts the other book. I wrote to the author and she agreed that this book is not nearly as good and that she has ""grown since writing"" this book. With the author's blessing, this book went right back to Amazon."
4,Extremely comfortable and blows up fast,"I had a fantastic air mattress that popped and I never knew the name of it. My old one would charge by plugging into the wall and then you could blow it up anywhere, such as camping without having it plugged in. I thought this was the same but it must be plugged in to blow up. that being said it is incredibly comfortable and I am fortunate enough to be able to plug it in to my car for camping purposes. I would definitely recommend this."
5,First rate air mattress,"This is an excellent product. It inflates and deflates very quickly, and is quite comfortable to sleep on. The velor top, and slight ridge around the sides, enable fitted sheets to stay on this mattress perfectly without slipping off. This is almost like a portable ""Select Comfort"" mattress for comfort, and has not leaked any air after 6 uses."
5,Very Happy,"I am very happy with the Queen Sized Mid-Rise Comfort Rest Airbed w/Electric Pump by Intex Model# 67701! Easy to set up and easy to put away! Just the way I like, no problems.Thanks,Walter P.Orange, Texas"
1,Leak problem,The first day i inflated to see if it worked and like in 5 minutes of inflating i noticed that it would lose air. This Air Bed Sucks it Doesnt WORK!!
1,Problems,"When my husband and I layed on it we had to wake up in the middle of the night to air it back up, it leaks out of the side where the pump is so there was no fixing or way to glue it."
3,Size is wrong,"I've seen this product on other web sites and noticed that the other web sites say the size is 60""x80"" (instead of 64""x 82"" the normal size for a queen bed.) I just thought if anyone else has a husband or partner who would appreciate having his/her feet hanging off the bed you would want to know. I'm glad I found out before I bought this. I didn't see another way to get the info corrected so I just put this note here. Enjoy!"
1,Permanent air leak!,"I bought two of these mattresses in less than three months. It never pumps fully, and it never holds the air for long. You sleep on it for less than four hours and your back starts hurting because of the air leak making it softer and breaks your back! I insisted to believe in this mattress because it is high up like a bed. But unfortunately it is a big disappointment!"
1,do all airbeds have holes,this is my second airbed the first one would deflate while you are sleeping and you wake up on the floor this one also deflates in the middle of night.If you want to buy an airbed spend alot of money and buy a quality one.
5,Easiest Set Up I've Ever Seen,"We were expecting company to stay, and nowhere to put them. Amazon was the first place I looked for Air Mattresses. We actually bought two at the same time. I was familiar with Intex, but had never used their brand before. I was thrilled at how easy they were to set up. Then the fact that they stayed inflated for 3 days without needing additional air, that was an added bonus. After our guests left, it took my husband and I about 5 minutes to deflate, roll up and store away each mattress. I would recommend this brand to anyone needing a comfortable, convenient, reliable air mattress."
5,THIS MIX ....da bomb!!!!!!!!,"If you haven't purchased this CD then you are missing a great ""FREESTYLE MIX"".The song selection is great and the MIXING & EDITING ARE INCREDIBLE,Track 21 will ""BLOW YOU AWAY""This is the CD that stay's in your CD player and you leave it on RE-PLAY ALL DAY."
1,Bad Boy Joe ruined every song,"Don't buy this CD with the intent of getting the original songs.... the DJ chose to perform some of his own ""freestyle"" scratching inside every song.... you're not getting what you remember from the radio when this material was new. Pass on this CD with a quickness!"
4,GOOD START....,"This CD definitely has a lot of good freestyle songs. However, a lot of these songs should not be on volume 1. They were decent hits but not some of the super hits you expect on a first volume compilation like this. The mixing is excellent and everything flows like you would expect from Bad Boy Joe. Being 4 other voulmes are out it doesn't pay for me to say the other songs I would have rather heard on here, but if you are only buying this cd because it is the first volume then that would be a mistake, you need at least volumes 2 and three to get A LOT of hits."
1,Don't waste your $$ !!,I bought this cd based soley on other reviews. I was extremely disappointed!!! I'm 31 & still have a great interest in dance music. This cd reminds me of a very bad techno club!! It was a waste of money!
3,"Songs good, but quality is lacking","The songs are well chosen, the mixing is good, but the sound quality is lacking something, not sure what. I was also disappointed that it plays in my discman but not my PC. And.. my PC supports all sorts of CDs/DVDs etc.oh well.."
5,WOW!,All I can say is BUY THIS CD! It is the best compilation I have ever heard of Freestyle!! you won't be dissappointed.
5,REAL MUSIC,FOR THE PRICE AND BEATS IT IS A VERY GOOD CD TO BUY.I LIKE THE MUSIC AND IT SOUND ALL ORINGINAL. FREESTYLE IS THE WAY MUSIC SHOULD BEEEEEEEE.
2,A few interesting concepts . . .,"Steffen makes a few interesting observations, but he also has made a number of glaring errors.First and foremost, he is rather insistant in his feeble defense of Blum's ""Wyrd"" (blank) rune theory. There is no ""blank"" rune. If you are given a set of runes, the ""blank"" (of which there should be several) is intended to be inscribed by the owner in the event that a carved rune is either broken or lost. There is NO reference to a ""blank"" rune anywhere in the history of runelore (encompassing multiple systems).Secondly, he adds odd correspondences and attributes to each rune (in addition to the ""traditional"" ones found in most other books. Apparently (as he is a ""quantum shaman""), Steffen seems to have come up with these new concepts himself, and wishes for them to be accepted as valid.If you've read Aswynn, Thorsson, and Tyson, you might consider taking a look at what Steffen has to say for himself and form your own conclusion."
3,Runic States,"I found Runic States informative. Steffen goes into depths about each rune and its relationships with the other runes. The only drawback I found was the fact that It was written from a scientific veiw point(this is not necessarily a bad thing, Its just abit odd to read). Over all i found it a good read and very informative."
2,fluted pie pan,"The picture was not sharp enough to indicate that the edge was not deeply fluted, as I had hoped. Chantal had produced what I was hoping to find, but the two that I bought were not it. I was disappointed but decided to keep them, thinking that the older model may not be available any longer."
4,Dusty Chaps: Tucson Home Town Heros!!!,"Any compilation that includes a Dusty Chaps track is automatically worth at least 4 stars! The Chaps were songwriter George Hawke's showcase band in the late 70's and early 80's. In their element, a grimy beer joint attached to an old motel down on the Benson Highway, they kicked butt. ""Don't Haul Bricks"" may not be their greatest track, but its very worthy and makes this album a must for me, as their various albums are completely unobtainable."
2,VERY NICE,"ERER IN MY MIND I HOLD THE SPECIAL ROUTE FAREAWAY. IN MY TV IN MY CHILD I CAN SEE THE SO SPECIAL ROUTE 66. NOW, I CAN'T SEE MY HEROS AGAIN(MARTIN MILLER& GEORGE MAHARIS BUT, I CAN LISTENTHE THEME ``ROUTE 66''"
4,awesome,This was a gift for my husband..he is a huge fan...he has played it over and over! great tunes on this one
5,Both inspirational and eminently practical!,"Whether the team with which you work is in a large or small business, in a non-profit organisation, or in a community group, you'll find this book a wonderful resource. As the introduction says ""Nearly every significant accomplishment in human systems today comes from the cooperation, positive energy and learning that result from a real team effort."" Appreciative Team Building explains the power that results from positive, appreciative questions. Using the strategies, suggestions, sample interview guides and 48 'starting point' questions provided in this book, you can help your team to shift from conversations that are problem-saturated (as they so often can tend to be in our current society) to conversations filled with new creativity, hope and possibility. Also clearly explained is a step-by-step process of Appreciative Inquiry that you can use to guide your team to achieve its own and its members very best potential. Highly recommended!"
5,Resource for anyone building a team,"If you are tired of the same old ""problem"" solving techniques and need to build a team and create a high energy environment, try the easy to use suggestions in this book. I gave it to all my sub team leaders."
3,No grommet holes,"The floor mats that I received did not have the grommet holes at the bottom of the mats, which are used to secure the mats to the floor of the car to prevent the mats from sliding and getting stuck under the gas pedal.."
5,Evangeline by Longfellow,"Evangeline is Longfellow's masterpiece. The poem begins withthe famous ""forest primeval"" . The reader is taken to the homeof the Acadian farmers and the famous village reminescentof a variety of tradespeople. The work describes wholecommunities dispersed and separated from the homeland in themid-1700s. Evangeline and Gabriel flee home and experiencethe pain of separation despite the fact that Gabriel seems tokeep a step ahead during a major part of the story. The workattests to the beauty and strength of a woman's devotion.In many ways, our fate and destiny tend to be random events which are out of our immediate control. This work traces thefate of important characters living in a state of uncontrolledflux and uncertainty . Readers of the poem will discoverhow the story unfolds and the difficult choices presentedat various stages of Longfellow's journey. The work iswritten utilizing an advanced vocabulary typical of thewriters during this period ."
5,"For all who love Evangeline, this will not disappoint!","I have a passion for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's lyrical lines of Evangeline. Therefore, I was uneasy in the purchase of Evangeline, A Novel. I shouldn't have been. Finis Fox's insight into the lives, loves and losses of the Acadians is remarkable. He adds to the story lines rather than detracting from them. His words are at once romantic and colorful, lulling you into passive reflection. The emotions are all there, the joy, the pain and the suffering. He does not stray far from Longfellow's poem, using the same names of people and places. It is a story worth reading! It would be worth the price if it were twice as much. I wish it could have been longer, but in staying true to Longfellow, the story moved much the same as did the poem. If you loved Evangeline, you will love this novel as much or maybe more!"
2,Not really,"This book honors brave Americans who went down with their ships or who survived their sinking. It doesn't contain anything on naval strategy, evaluation of doctrine, characteristics of leadership, strengths and weaknesses of destroyer design, or any basic or advanced questions. The bibliography is thin, although the book took ten years to write. Its language is that of the patrol report: hits on targets give ""satisfaction"" to crews; fires are ""holocaustic;"" explosions ""volcanic."" Those looking for sea yarns or details should read first-person accounts of those who served on ships of interest. This is not a definitive book on destroyer operations in the Pacific War, but it does show how good men suffered."
4,An excellent overview of an exciting subject,"I purchased this book to learn about a subject I knew little about. I have since become fascinated with the subject.It is story in brief, of every American Destroyer lost during the Second World War.It is the kind of book you could read at one (very long) seating, or read on the hurry - one ship at a time. If you like tales of the sea, you will love this book."
2,what is this novel even about?,"The main character thinks too much to herself... I mean that's how alot of novels carry on their story lines but this is just ridiculous - she seems to be having constant breakdowns and freaking out about everything! I find the main character really annoying because of that and the fact has a really low self-esteem. Eck.Also the main guy and the his backstory... was pretty dang ridiculous. I was on chapter 11 and with like 2-3 more chapters to go, I just shut the book."
1,Save Your Money!!!!!!,"This snooze fest is not even worth checking out of the Library. I wish I could get a refund. This book belongs in a town called ""Boring USA."" There is no plausable plot and after learning Nick Snow's ""Big Secret"" I finally decided to put myself out of misery and return the book to my bookshelf. Sigh!!! Call me Ms. Dissappointed."
1,Totally Boring,This book is really boring and I love chick lit. It is so boring that each time I pick it up I forget what I read before. The story line in this book is going no-where fast. I'm up to chapter 3 and I just can't face reading anymore. It is a mystery to me why it is coming out in paperback. Maybe so less people will be hurt when it's flung across a room in disgust?
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I visit a website by the same name and had been looking forward to reading this for some time. What a disapointment!I am so sick of books that are by the numbers! I wasn't expecting too much, just an entertaining read, but this had a wafer thin plot, a cliched cutesy heroine, and no wit or originality to commend it."
4,frantic fashion antics,"Rebeccasreads recommends SOME LIKE IT HAUTE for those who want an insider's look at the workings of the world of fashion & reality television. It has it all: a handsome hunk, Americans abroad, wardrobe malfunctions, maddening misunderstandings.As is often noted by the charming & frenetic Alex, she's both ""smart and shallow"" with a sharp sense of the absurd.SOME LIKE IT HAUTE is a breathless romp & a wish list for the fashion-challenged, & in the end, the gal does get the guy, sort of."
2,Disappointing,"I have had a hard time getting into this book! It reads like a badly written blog. I just can't relate to the character who is addicted to haute couture and...? That's about all I could get from the character-- who IS she?? It's reads like a 2nd draft, rather than the finished edited book."
1,Couldn't get into it...,"Simply boring. I make it about a third of the way through, and kept waiting for an interesting plot or something to hold my attention. If anything exciting happens later in the book, someone please let me know."
1,Plotless,"This book is one of many that never should have been. You'd think that with Julie Dam's education, she would at least have had the ability to see that she had no story, and that a novel without one is a sorry thing at best. Add to that the usual forced humor, and you have one very miserable reading experience."
2,Cute But Does Not Do Much,"This puppy does make puppy sounds, lifts its head, opens its eyes and will go to ""sleep"" quickly. My daughter loves animals but said ""is that all"" after getting this puppy. She expected the puppy to do more but I guess it really is being a newborn and not doing much."
3,Not what I expected!,"It's a cute puppy, but its not what I expected. Alot of the reviews I read said that they wore so enjoyable and that there kids love it, but when I got it, my daughter had it for a day and hasn't pay much attention to it."
3,Good creative play,"I do not have this particular item. I have the house that the garage attaches to. The set is sturdy and allows for hours of imaginative play. Although, $50 is a bit pricey for this add on, it makes a nice addition to the house and offers additional venues for creative play. They do make a car that is made to fit in it. I would measure the interior before I'd buy a different toy car to put inside."
3,THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD THESAURUS,"As far as pure volume of words goes, this thesaurus is kind of weak. I have had many occasions when I was looking for a particular word and could not find it in this book. The book is, however, sturdy, convenient, and just full enough that I'd have to suggest it. If you do a lot of thesaurus work, then perhaps this volume isn't for you, but if you're on the run a lot and need only a fast, convenient source of similarly defined words than this is more than enough thesaurus to do the job."
2,A bitter disappoinment! :(,"As a HUGE fan of the original adaptation, (still feel like a kid when I think about it)I was sadly very disappointed with Tim Burton, Depp and Elfman. The Acting is un-believable and quite silly really. Why is Depp so uptight about kids? We never learn why he seems so put out by them. His ""okay"" was even more troubling than Pesci's in lethal Weapon 26. Elfman lost his way here, the scores and musical numbers are so uninteresting I nearly fell asleep with boredom. I could not understand half of the lyrics and the single ""oompa"" was not cute, interesting or anything you would want to emulate. I am of the opinion that Burton is a genius, thank heavens for a risk taking eccentric. Here he became mired in the backgrounds and lost himself in the substance. I disagree that the author would be proud of this work, wholeheartedly.Not worth buying, rent it and wait until someone dumps their copy on ebay for a buck if you want your own copy."
2,A morass of ego.,"A lousy, unengaging script. Characters that go nowhere, and/or disappear for great lengths of the film. Trite flashbacks. Bad one-liners...To those who say ""it's just supposed to be about nonsense"", I respond, that even a film that is supposedly about nonsense needs to have structure and an engaging screenplay to succeed as a film. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory cannot hide behind its overweening fantastical settings; the screenwriter and director are LAAAAZY. Then again, Burton has never been strong on scripts -- look at his Batman films (plot holes ALL over the place) for some perfect examples. It blows me away that a man approaching 50, and a highly respected director, does not understand these things."
1,Simply Terrible. No Humour. No Mystery. Nothing.,"This awful awful remake of an absolutely perfect movie known as ""Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" reminds me of the equally insufferable ""Cat In The Hat"" starring Mike Myers and ""Toys"" starring Robin Williams some years back. Just wasted, empty time. Johnny Deep's character casts Wonka as an effeminate sociopath emotionally and psychologically crippled by a repressive childhood. It's just not believable. It felt like the incredibly overrated Johnny Depp trying to act weird and creepy instead of the character being so. There's no laughs. There's no warmth. There's no suspense. The musical numbers are plain dumb and desperate. It's a complete fail. There really was no need to remake Wonka. Gene Wilder's performance was pure genius. Depp's Wonka is simply a case of bad acting to a poorly written script. I don't care about the book and whether this film sticks closer to it. It STINKS."
1,Terrible,"Pales in comparison to original. Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder, there was just something flat and missing from this version. I tried watching it again recently only to remember just how terrible it is."
3,"An Okay, Movie...","This movie doesn't compare to the original version. If Tim Burton thought this was an improvement, he's probably certifiable. The music doesn't hold the same charm, Johnny Depp is just strange in comparison to Wilder's genious, and though I like the Charlie character better than the original, he's really the best part about the movie. Why he had all the oompa loompa be the same man, I don't know, but their songs are completely incoherent in which case defeats the purpose of their singing in the first place.So since they don't compare, let's not compare them and accept this for what it is, a decent children's movie with a good moral to it. The importance of family. The original is a charming classic that will last for ever. The new one is acceptable."
2,ahhh!!!,i hated this movie! me and my friend couldnt finish watching it. i thought it was bad. i loved the original. this 1 was too weird. it had a couple good parts but no that many. the oompa loopa songs were not the same. oompa loopmas were not the same. the were not orange with green hair. wat was up with that!! i def would not suggest this to any of my friends or any lovers of the original!
1,Boring and Bad Acting,This is not as good as the original.Johnny Depp makes Willie Wonka look like an stupid idiot. I watched it with my 7 year old. I kept falling asleep and she ended up leaving the room to go play. Fortunatley I rented it for free. I still feel cheated though.
2,Gene Wilder...,Yes....Johnny Depp...NO...not even close...BUD...its just that simple. The reviews can actually all stop here. Depp falls down....the remake with him...whereas Wilder PROPELLS the original!!
2,Joke,Wow wear to begin. The movie had some hope untill johny came on...With the lame jokes...Horrible performance....And must i say they got rid of the good oompa loompa look? Instead they use only ONE person and multiply him a hundred times. Yes the same exact person. The songs continuesly interupt the movie which they suck badly. The only way you will enjoy this movie is if you are stoned completely.
1,Another classic destroyed!,This movie was actually pretty good up untill Johnny Depps performance! Don't get me wrong I think he is a good actor but his performance was horrible in this movie. When will hollywood learn and leave classic movie alone and stop making them into S**t movies. Plain and simple: THIS MOVIE SUCKED!
1,disapointing,Strays from the book and becomes a morality play about estranged parents. The original is still the best.Dep acts creepy like a child molester in this film and he bears an uncanny resemblance to a mix between Michael Jackson and Marylin Manson.
2,It was craptastic!,"Gawd that movie was annoying. I blindly thought it was a sequel where Charlie had grown up and was ready to pass the factory on to someone else. That would have made perfect sense a generation later. But no-- it was a freakin' remake of a classic. And a sad one at that. Johnny Depp's performance was stilted and lifeless, unlike Gene Wilder who was eccentric and endearing. No wonder he's bitter! I guess the original had some deep meaning to me as a kid, and probably most of the kids today won't know the difference. But man did I sit there bored stiff. In fact the best part was the preview for Tim Burton's Corpse Bride."
1,"I would smile, but the chocolate has rotted my teeth.","Well what kind of message is this sending to our children? 'Charlie and the Chocolate factory?' I wouldn't be suprised if we see a surge of child obesity and a decline of dental hygiene! Why not 'Charlie and the apple tree?' That'd be wholesome!Also the obvious undertones to the story left a less than sweet taste in my mouth.The children who won the truckloads of chocolate would have died of obesity, or a massive heart attack.Wonka's obvious peadophilic intentions of drawing children into his enclosed factory, treating them and dazzling the parents with chocolate waterfalls and tiny clones.And the blatant ploy by Wonka to get up slumped sails by sending out golden tickets was such a transparent marketing technique.Overall, i give this movie a one. Although i did enjoy the puppets getting incinerated. I hate puppets."
1,"It may have Johnny Depp in it, but it can't compare with the original",I think the original is better. That's all I have to say. Johnny Depp looks totally spooky.
2,Weird!,"Not a family film in anyway. This film is just weird, scary and not really entertaining. Why film makers of now-a-days think that they can outdo something as wonderful as the original production is way beyond me. I was not impressed, if anything the film was extremely distorting. I should have realized that Tim Burton does not have a grip on reality anyway. Hollywood gets more weird each day and i believe that i will be staying away from Hollywood/american entertainment of film making. No wonder less and less people are viewing american films. It seems that whatever is produced in Hollywood should stay in Hollywood. It would be a blessing if someday the state of California just breaks off and falls into the ocean."
1,POINTLESS REMAKE FROM THE 1971 ORIGINAL!!,"Save your money folks!! Or better yet buy the 1971 ORIGINAL starring Gene Wilder. This Johnny Depp hokum fails in every department. Nothing can compare to the 1971 classic which is superior to this disaster. The 1971 classic even has one of the most beautiful and engaging musical scores ever with the haunting tune ""IMAGINATION"". Hollywood fails again trying to top a classic that CANNOT EVER BE TOPPED!! Watching this made me want to get the original even more...which is exactly what I did!! That one merits 5 stars and more!! This Johnny Depp film is pure garbage!"
1,Tim Burton did it all wrong!,Oh my god this is no Willy Wonka at all! The songs sounds terrible and that Willy Wonka theme is annoying. Johnny Depp looks awful as Willy Wonka. Why the hell did they choose him? The original Willy Wonka is better the new one looks crappy and those Oompa Loompa guys don't even look the same as the original. It almost looks like another movie of The Stupids. It looks horrible!
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","That's the only way I can describe this remake with Johnny Depp. This version lacks the charm, warmth and humor found in the original version with Gene Wilder. Johnny Depp comes across cold and unfeeling without any enthusiasm thru out the whole entire movie. The rest of the cast stunk just as well. I can't even imagine how this movie got the ratings that it did but I for sure will never watch this version again."
1,Saccharine,"This reminds me of Gus Van Sant's remake of PSYCHO...what little there is that is any good here is lifted wholesale from the original (Burton claimed to greatly dislike Mel Stuart's version, yet he borrows quite liberally), and otherwise adds absolutely nothing. Johnny Depp is awful, and the woeful addition of a backstory, to put it diplomatically, defeats the purpose of Wonka by humanizing him. This version robs the Dahl book and Stuart movie of all the precious moral and otherworldly ambiguities of Wonka, turning him into a pathetic recluse whose cure can only be provided, in Burton's version, by the magic of family. Nauseating."
3,Dark & weird,"Very quirky. Very colorful. Lots of imagination. But weird. Johnny Depp did a good job with what he was given. I was never a fan of the original movie, so I was looking forward to something new. Adding Wonka's back-story gave it an even darker side. I'd recommend this movie only to 7 to 11 year old boys that like gooey, gross stuff."
5,Forget the past!,"Forget Gene Wilder. Forget Jack Albertson. Forget Michael Jackson.Just go to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with NO preconceptions -- and no ""baggage"" -- and you will have a wonderful time. The direction, the music, the acting (everyone), all facets of the production were great fun and very entertaining.Before I saw the film, I had read every critique and interview I could find and the ONLY valid (in my mind) criticism I found was that the music during the Oompah-Loompas (sp?) songs was a little too loud to hear the words.So to reiterate: Go to this movie to enjoy THIS movie -- NOT the movie others would have you see."
1,This world is going to the dogs,"Johnny depp sucks,he's about as unperfect for the roll of willy wonka as Micheal Jackson would be to a james bond movie,lol anyway... I think the only reason he got the roll for willy wonka is cuz the evil director known that all his stupid girls fan club would go see the movie and it would be a hit, thats the problem with the modern mainstream society, everything is done without passion and is done for the sake of making millions of dollars instead, or just compare this version of willy wonka to the orininal one and you'll see what i mean."
2,This fell flat to me.,"This movie just wasn't all that great. It seemed more like an excuse to give Johnny Depp screen time than to actually tell the story. I'm rather neutral towards the actor, as I am about most actors, the movie itself just really doesn't hold up. It seems like it was weird for the sakes of being weird without a whole lot to redeem it. Depth was lacking where it was needed, and depth was added in areas that could have been left alone. I did read the book BTW, a long time ago - the whole Willies dad angle could have been left out, it didn't seem like it really added anything to the story. I'm not one of those people who expects a movie to exactly follow a book, but I am one of those people who expects a movie to come out well."
4,Strange but delicious,"I loved this movie as a child. It had a magical aura about it, with all of the crazy creations in the factory and the eccentric and fascinating Mr. Wonka.This version is a good modern-day representation of the movie. The sets are outstanding and creatively done. The Oompa Loompas are slightly more disturbing in this version (which may have something to do with the fact that they're all played by a single actor), but they're entertaining. There is a slight twist in plot in this version, as you get to delve a bit more deeply into Willy Wonka's childhood, but I feel it works within the story.This movie certainly has the Tim Burton stamp on it. Even if you didn't know he was the director, you would be able to draw similarities between the feel of this movie and his others such as Edward Scissorhands. It's worth a watch."
4,Johnny Depp at his best,"I love this movie...Johnny Depp is always good at what he does...I personally think he's great in this movie. I would have preferred if they had a ""making of"" in the special features section, but whatever...I learned how to dance like an Oompa Loompa..."
5,A Wonderful Film,"Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is one of those films that gets better every time you watch it. The first time I saw it, I thought Johnny Depp's performance was a little too awkward and bizarre for the film, but now I totally get it, and I think he was brilliant in the role. The film looks incredible on Blu-ray. I highly recommend this movie!"
4,As Good As The Original,"I really didn't want to see this movie but my kids begged to go. So, I took them and I am SO GLAD I did. I LOVED this movie as much as I did the first one. Johnny Depp did a wonderful job as Willie Wonka. This movie is a MUST SEE for ALL ages. Watch it and enjoy!!"
2,The Ups and Down of Charlie and the Chocalate Factory,"Maybe if I didn't read the book and watched the original movie I would have given it 2 stars, but I did too much. It was different then both of them. Both of them were better.The oompa loompas (I hope I spelled it right.) are not like the original ones. There songs are good, but I absolutely love the one in the original movie. I think they had the hardest part in the movie which is pretty sad to me seeing as Johnny Depp or whoever plays Charlie should.The part about Willy's childhood was sad but made no sense. How do you love teeth better than your own child? Did the dad only search for him when he made candy? Why could Willy just let them live in the factory in the first place? His family is not all that bad. Just because he didn't get enough love that doesn't mean he can't either.I liked how they showed the outcome of the other Golden Ticket winners."
2,"No joy, no fun","In general, I enjoy classic movies and I also generally hate remakes. Unfortunately, this is no exception.There is very little magic in this movie as there was in the original. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willie Wonka is very different than Gene Wilder's. It is dark and mysterious, sometimes he comes off as downright cruel. The entire movie seems rushed and forced, and the unneeded sub-plots don't help. Also, the oompa-loompas did not impress me.In short, this movie is strange, and very different from the original. Stick to the classic version that we all know and love."
4,Burton and Dahl are quite compatible,"The Bottom Line:This fusion of two subtly-sadistic auteurs in director Tim Burton and children's novelist Roald Dahl makes for a much better film than I expected when I saw the trailers back in 2005; I don't think it's as good as Gene Wilder's version, but it hits enough different notes that it can be treated as a separate film rather than a remake, and a good film at that.3/4"
5,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2 Disc Special Edition) DVD,Interesting version of the original Willie Wonka. The kids wanted to watch it over and over again.Updated graphics and songs. Loved the little boy who played Charlie--sweet spirit.
3,Pretty Good,"this film would have been even better had there been some Editing of a few things here&there.I enjoy the many elements&Direction of the film.Johnny Depp does a good job. there is a Michael Jackson influence here in the sense of a Successful Man doing his thing, just as with Edward Scissorhand had as well.but this film bogs down with the Music parts where the singing parts kick in.still a interesting film nevertheless."
5,Great Movie,One of my 3 yr olds fav movies since she was 2 or so. She scratched the first one and so I came here to find a new one. Didn't have to pay full price to get the same thing!
5,A Delicious Adventure,"This movie was a delight. It was much better than the original and had a lot of emotional moments.The acting, special effects, and songs were amazing.Interestingly enough, this is the second movie Johnny Depp was in involving chocolate."
3,Weird Movie,This is a great movie but it is so weird. Don't get me wrong or anything but when Willy Wonka tals and does all that stuff he just says plain o WEIRD things.
3,3 1/2 stars - A weird version of a film that didn't need updating.,"The movie isn't bad... there are some neat visuals and most of the special effects are outstanding. Deep Roy as the ONLY Oompa Loompa, though, got a bit annoying.... he was in the film more than any other actor... over and over and over... just kinda creepy. The original film has definitely not been surpassed here in terms of creativity, originality, or the story.Not a bad film at all, just super weird and the whole movie felt unnecessary, and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wonka was the ultimate in bizarre, but I liked it."
4,Fun,"My daughter is 5 and loves Tim Burton. This is visually fun, off-beat and entertaining. I certainly don't mind having it on in the background and love that it is visually more interesting than a lot of stuff out there."
1,Awful adaption of a good book,"To open this review I have to say that this movie was a awful movie to a very good book. Also the book did not have the ending that this one had and the original was much better, and here's my thoughts about it.Acting in the original was much better.What the heck is this, Oompa Loompa come out in stylish black suits, Oompa Loompa's have a rock band?And in the original at the end charlie hade to prove himeself a good person, in this film""charlie youre the last one, youre the winner""!I hope you can see what I mean about this movie,Rated Goverall: an awful film"
1,sucked horribly,"My critique of the movie:Johnny Depp's acting was horrible, as ever. The Oompa Loompa's look was redundant and uncreative. True, it was nice to see teh songs put to music, but this film, IMHO, sucked A LOT. My cousins and I were making fun of this movie after we saw it, and we were trashing it, that's how bad we thought it was.The original owns, at least Gene Wilder didn't make Willy Wonka seem like he was out of touch with the world. GOD! The original was better on EVERY level, it was funnier too.But this is just my opinion."
4,*,"A remake of an old classic. It has redeeming parts through out and Depp's performance is well done. If you are looking it to follow the old movie - it does not. It you are looking for the connection to the book, there is very little. Enjoy the movie for itself."
2,Boring and creepy,"I'm a big fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp... and Danny Elfman. But this movie is incredibly terrible. Sure, Johnny Depp's interpretation of Willy Wonka is very interesting and unique... but this movie and its music is completely unmemorable and offputting."
2,Not as sweet as chocolate.,"Well, I love the original version. I watched the new version of the film and then re-watched the old one and the old one was so much better. The child actors played the parts especially better than the children in the new version of the movie. The new one is just over-the-top and seems to force computer technology in our faces to make up for the lame acting. If you loved the original, this will be fun to watch and compare, but you will find yourself being loyal to the old version. Worth a rent, but that's it."
2,This film is a slap in the face.,"I didn't rate it one star, because honestly (and upsettingly), I've seen worse.However, I'm afraid I have to offer you some age-old wisdom:If a remake comes out, just watch the original if you want to be reminded of it.To me, casting Johnny Depp where Gene Wilder once was is raw and uncut sacrilege. Anything such as that, which would even suggest Depp=Wilder, is an immediate contrast of common sense.I think Tim Burton would probably be better off shooting himself before he has the opportunity to destroy his own work as well."
4,"I liked it, but minus a star for the oompa loompa","I really like this film. However, I have to disagree with Burton ,that the guy who plays the oompa loompa is a very interesting person. he isn't at all. The songs are awful and hurried. Especially the teleport TV song. It was the worst..and that creepy little oompa loompa was just awful in that number.The only decent loompa song was the squirrel song.They should have found a better songwriter for the film.The first puppet song was cute though, and when the puppets caught on fire, well that was splendidly twisted...For some reason, Willy Wonka reminded me of the woman from ""Strangers With Candy"""
3,Faithful to a fault,"This version may be more faithful to Roald Dahl's classic tale, but there wasn't as much life in those everlasting gob stoppers as I would have imagined. Depp deftly captures Willie Wonka and Burton creates a vivid set of images of the novella, but the movie looked too much like a picture book and failed to create the tension and thrill of the story the way the original version with Gene Wilder did. This movie is amazingly somber and dull, with the characters walking gingerly over the sets, afraid it seems to touch the world Burton has created. He turns each scene carefully over, like one would do in a pop-out children's book. The kids are faithful restorations of those in the novel, when Burton could have updated them and given them far more spunk. Anyway, the film is a visual treat with some fun side stories like Wonka's discovery of the Oompa Loompas."
3,Is Michael Jackson the real Willy Wonka?,"Who's idea was it to make Willy Wonka look like Michael Jackson? Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson, but I'm talking when he was younger and still black. I also love Johnny Depp, in almost every movie he's been in, but I really feel he was miscast in this movie! Or at least they should have made him look a little more normal. The movie had good special effects, and decent acting, but overall it was nothing special."
3,I Still Love the Oompah Loompahs!,"I enjoyed this movie very much; more than I expected, actually. I thought Johnny Depp did a great job portraying Willie Wonka. I do not understand the comparison to Michael Jackson.The story line remains unchanged in this movie. A poor boy wins one of only 10 tickets to tour the Willie Wonka chocolate factory. Throughout the factory tour, the less well-behaved children begin to have negative experiences (such as blowing up as a huge blueberry and falling into a vat of melted chocolate).The Charlie character is sweet and lovable as is the grandfather. The Oompah Loompahs are still cool, though they're all played by the same actor in this version of the movie.I would recommend this movie to relax. Nothing to take too seriously."
2,Ehhh...,"It might be the face that the orginal Charlie and The Choclate Factory was so good that the remake by Tim Burton didn't live up to my standards. I like Tim Burton and the movies he makes but, tampering with a classic is just wrong. Everyone who had seen the orginal loved it but people who went back and saw the remake were less than satisfied. They left out parts of the orginal like the everlasting gobstopper and the bubble scene. These two things were not in the book but made the first movie that much stronger. The movie was appealing visually but that what Tim Burton does best. Overall this movie was a so-so makeover which left critics and fans frowning."
1,Can never beat the original,"Though Tim Burton is a great director of magical movies and Johnny Depp is a terrific actor you cant beat an all time classic at all. the original will always be better because it was great, a remake would be pointless. But I haven't seen it so it could be good but not like the original."
1,worst thing to happen to film since gilgi...,"...and it hasnt even come out yet!!!! It seems nowaddays the only movies to make are ones that have been already made, this is where you gotta draw the line though. The orignal willy wonka was bananas! How are they gonna top the tunnel scene? Do you really think Johnny Deep can do a better willy than Gene Wilder?Plus, you know they're gonna change all the songs (bad move). Not to mention in this Bush-era, with all the censorship and what not, you know they're not gonna have all the little adult jokes that the original had.but what really has me down about this movie was i reading about the writer, who had never seen the first prior to writing this film, and he said that he was surprised how DARK the first in comparision to his.this one is gonna be strictly for the kidsits a shame"
1,Tim Burton and the crap movie factory!,"I haven't seen this movie but I can tell just from the trailers it sucks. Look at this list of Tim Burton films: Batman, Batman Returns, Edward Scisorhands, Beetlejuice, Planet Of The Apes - just to name a few. All bad!I find Johnny Depp to be an unlikeable actor. Just because you are willing to dress up as a bunch of weird characters (Edward Scissorhands, Captain Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka) or talk with a weird voice doesn't make you a unique or good actor.Tim and Johnny why don't you both quit whilst you are behind!"
5,BURTON DOES IT AGAIN,This is the movie based on the original book. Charlie and the choclate factory is about a little boy named charlie who finds one of the 5 golden tickets in a bar of choclate and goes to the legendary Choclate factory run by Willy Wonka. Excluding the oompa loompa songs this movie is one of my favorites. This is nothing like the original movie staring Gene Wilder. Willy Wonka is played by Johnny Depp. I loved JD in this movie. I loved him in this movie alot (Even though he kinda reminds me of Michael Jackson abit). Even so this is a really good family movie and is slowly becoming one of my favorite movies. Don't rent it. Buy It.
1,Commentary,"I must say that I really am angry that the HD DVD of this film had an audio commentary that the regular DVD didn't. I really hope it is just this one time and that this trend doesn't continue, because if it does, I and many like me are screwed"
1,A major disappointment!,"Ugh what is everyone talkin about sayin that this movie was awesome? I thought it sucked big time. I was about to leave during the middle of it. The new Oompa Lompa's were NOT Oompa Lompa's and Johnny Depp looked terrible as Willy Wonka. This movie can really put me to sleep. The songs were terrible and not funny. The movie should have been PG-13 and everything in the movie looked so fake and unreal. If you hadn't seen the movie yet don't because it's boring, crappy special effects, terrible acting, and bad dialogue. The original is much better."
2,Dull reproduction of a classic.,"I had hopes in going to see this film. I have loved almost all of Tim Burton's work. I thought that the twisted imagination of Tim Burton would really help to capture the quirky Willy Wonka. This movie was disappointing at best. A few of the visuals were very good (the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but the overall movie production was horrible. What especially disappointed me was the fact that there was only one oompa-loompa. Come on Tim, was there not enough small people who needed work?. The sound of the oompa-loompa musical numbers I would compare to scraping nails on a chalkboard. There is no better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder in the original 1971 version. Avoid this movie unless you want a headache."
3,Not that good...,"I just went and watched the movie and was VERY disapointed by it. Most of all Johnny Depp was horrible as Willy Wonka. He was creepy and physochotic. Gene Wilder was 100 times better, he was more eccentric and magical and more true to how I pictured Willy Wonka from reading the book.All in all the movie was fun to watch but nothing spectacular. I liked the actors/actresses in the older movie better, one exception being the part of Charlie."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!,i wish i didint give this movie one star it deserves none this movie wasint funny at all it was boring from the beggining but i was hopeing it was gonna be a good movie since i love freddie highmore and all that but no it was the wrost movie ever they made plenty of mistakes and it was just plain boring!!!! there is nothing like the oringinals... and by the way no one can make an oringinal movie better cuz then it comes out worse!
2,Left me oddly unsatisfied.,"I wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't open my heart to it. It is strangely cold and unwelcoming. I like Depp normally but this performance missed the mark somehow. It's like he couldn't quite find a rhythm for the character. There are very few laughs and a hackneyed storyline involving Wonka's father that seemed superfluous. The effects are neat, but without a compelling story it really doesn't matter. Burton managed to squeeze the humanity and fun out of the beloved Dahl story, and left us with something chilly and bizarre. And not in a good way."
2,weird and twisted,"I watched this when I was little, so I wanted my kids to see it. I remember it being strange, but I don't remember it being that strange. It was so twisted that the 5 year old got bored and fell asleep, which he never does during a movie. The 8 year old asked me to turn it off after watching 3/4 of it. If you just gotta see it, rent it and return it."
1,Not for young children,"Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is a disgrace. This once-beloved character has been turned into a psychotic, parent-hating, extremely juvenile, WEIRDO.My young daughter has had nightmares about ""little squirrels"" EVERY NIGHT since seeing this film over the summer. In this version of the film, squirrels attack Veruca Salt and throw her into a hole.Finally, a brief, yet totally unnecessary, scene of two homosexuals walking their dog is a part of this so-called ""family film"".I am extremely disappointed in this remake. It really could have been done in a much better way."
3,Well It Started Good,"I won't be a spoiler...but having said that I was not happy with the ending...or how Tim Burton interpreted the ending...Now that that is out of the way, Johnny Depp was, as usual, great. His portrayal of Willie Wonka was amazing...although the haircut was left over from the Dutch Boy paint can. And the casting of Charlie was spot on. Although I liked the first grandpa bucket from the Gene Wilder version.It was a good film, but like many films based on books, it could not fully recreate the magic of the Dahl book. Better than the first film?...maybe, but I don't like musicals!"
1,Beyond bad....,"This movie was such a disappointment on so many levels. It turned a belved childrens story into one describing a twisted psychopath who isn't warm or endearing just nuts. Depp's portayal of Willie Wonka makes the character out to be the type that yo'd tell your kids to stay away from and definetely not to take any candy from. The Oompa Loompa songs have been changed to ""Rap"" and the lessons learned are lost in a sea of political correctness (Won't call a kid a brat, etc). Doo yourself a favor and forget this abomination and get the 1971 version."
3,Had potential but fell short,I grew up with the original version and there are some things you really wanted this to have. The biggest let down to me was the Oompa Loopa. I feel ripped off that this movie only had 1 and the rest were computer generated. I a sure there are plenty of little people in Hollywood that would love to be in this movie. If anything the movie company was being cheap and trying to save buck. Johnny Depp was great as always.
1,One Oompa-Loompa,"While watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I kept wondering why there was only one Oompa-Loompa, sometimes made into several using what looked like 1960s trick photography. Tim Burton's other effects were good, as usual. Depp's acting was all right - he always goes for something original and he usually succeeds - one of the all-time greats; but Depp did come across as acting in this one, rather than as convincing. Gene Wilder was too hard an act to follow without doing Willy in drag, or something. The reason I would not bother to see this film a second time was the odd decision to use one actor to play all of the Oompa-Loompas (165 of them). What motivated that decision? Every Oompa-Loompa scene (and there are many) got monotonous. I can find other ways to be bored ... for free. I give this film one Oompa-Loompa. That's all Tim Burton gave us."
5,Willy Wonka as Mr. Dahl wrote it!,"This movie has what the original movie lacked and the book had in spades, a dark side. Mr. Dahl never writes down at children and neither does this movie. Totally crazy and great. Johnny Deep does a great job at being lovable and creepy. Give the movie a go. I really can't believe it only ahve 4 stars right now."
1,totally creepy,Depp's take on Willie Wonka was totally creepy. They obviously purposefully took Michael Jackson as a main model for the role. But he's even much creepier. The special effects just didn't make it for me. A shame. Aweful movie.
1,HORRIBLE REMAKE,This movie was the worst and I was looking foward to it. This is was a real disappointment. I saw it once in theaters and once at school about 8 of 24 kids in my class fell asleep. No one laughed. They made Johnny Depp look gay and they did a bad job on the ompa lompas. They were all the same. At least the first one had real people do the ompa loompas.
1,"Yes, I grew up with the Gene Wilder version - I TRIED to like it...","but I just couldn't. I kept an open mind during the beginning of the movie, but the movie kept getting darker and darker. Very disappointing to my husband and myself. My daughter loved it however... but she didn't grow up with the Wilder version.I would NOT say that Johnny Depp did a bad job... I just did not care for this version of the character of Willy Wonka."
3,Yet another remake,"Here Burton goes again remaking a classic. What's with that? In my opinion, he's overrated as a director. Why can't he and his team come up with anything original? Johnny Depp gives a great performance as usual though. Unfortunately, that's probably the only reason to see it. It just doesn't come even remotely close to the classic from 1971 - Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. In C&TCF, the Oompa Loompas are played by one guy wearing a red jumpsuit. The Oompa Loompas were much much better in the earlier version WW&TCF. And painted a much different image for the viewer. They had orange skin and green hair and had the charm and charisma lacking in this later version of the story. I chuckled a couple times though, so I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,Nice Family Movie,"This a nice family movie both kids and adults can enjoy. Kids will really like it.I thought it was a nice movie I'm not raving about it though. If you are trying to cut candy and chocoalte out of your diet don't see this move, you will have massive cravings for it. And those songs are very catchy as well."
2,First one was better,Kids wanted to watch and I usually like Johnny Depp. He was too creepy and there wasn't enough of a difference between the old and new movie. Stick with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.
3,What's With The Crappy Ending???,"This film did not need to be made. I guess that is my main problem with it. I wanted to enjoy it, because I loved the classic, but this is a far cry from that. The original was a dark comedy...this film just made everything too right at the end.The beginning was also way too drawn out. Come on, we all know that Charlie eventually gets a golden ticket...let's get on with the story already.Depp had me laughing at a couple parts and the obsessive sports-mom had a few good lines, but otherwise I was unimpressed. How about originality out of Hollywood? Wow, does every film need to be remade? Can't you people think of anything new?"
5,Two thumbs up,"According to my son ""It's the best, the really really best. Wow. Good acting. I loved the tunnel scene."""
2,Original Movie is much better,"This movie cannot hold a candle to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Gene Wilder simply outperforms Depp as Wonka. Nice visual effects, but the older version is simply much better."
1,A Big Waste Of Time!!!!,"I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder."
2,strange and creepy,"i found this movie to be nothing what i expected. obviously hoping that it'd be a fun, updated wacky (Burtonish?) version of the original... I instead came upon a strange, unfunny retelling of our beloved first film. and please don't misunderstand... i absolutely love Tim Burton and his films, and am one of Johnny Depp's biggest fans... yet i found Depp's performance awkward, and the film itself not warm, endearing or funny.and what was with the single computer-cloned oompa loompa? and the overly serious child contestants? in the original they may have been brats, but at least they were funny. everything has such a serious, somber overtone here...i guess it's worth a look, maybe a rental, but overall for me, this was a real disappointment. please go find Gene Wilder instead. that's your true Wonka story."
1,Weird,"This movie was definitely weird. It freaked me out. The first one was outstanding. I tried to watch this one multiple times and I still did not, do not and will not like it. Nothing looked real in the movie. Everything was computerized. The only thing the movie was missing was robots. I am surprised the children weren't robots. The contrast of the movie was dark and silver. There was no brightness or color in the movie."
2,"Mediocre, at best","I have enjoyed most, if not all, of Johnny Depp's work in the past. Not this time. His interpretation of Willy Wonka is horrible. Depp's Wonka is annoying, whiney and just plain unlikable - Depp seemed to be going for that tired Jim Carrey goofball routine here - if I wanted to watch Jim Carrey do Willy Wonka I... wouldn't.Beyond Depp's lousy Wonka the movie does have some redeeming qualities - Charlie is a very likable character and sticks pretty close to the original. Violet and Augustus are also pretty good - although the latter's gluttony was pushed just a tad too much. The other children were quite forgettable. Some of the factory/oompa loompa scenes were quite good (the boat scene), while others were poor (finding the oompa loompas... why?).Overall, a movie I was very interested to see is one I will never watch again. 2 stars is probably generous."
3,Cynical Charlie,"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was quite an acceptable movie. Johnny Depp was fantastic as Willy Wonka, as was Charlie, Charlie's Grandpa, Charlie's family and most of the other kids who win golden tickets. The movie has also been updated well for today's audiences. Unfortunately that is also the biggest fault. For my personal tastes it is ever so slightly too cynical, therein losing the magic. It's a little too real for my liking, but that may appeal to some. I guess you should make up your own mind. Either way, definitely worth checking out."
3,This movie just didn't try hard enough to remake a classic,"I thought that all the magical effects that directors can sprinkle on their movies these days would make everything better, but this movie just showed me how unrealistic that can be. First of all the original tops this one, maybe not in special effects, but yes in everything else. The new one had no memorable music like the first one. The storyline didn't improve, and sort of cheap. Johnny Depp was good, but not as good as the old Willy Wonka that he was trying to emulate. If you saw the original (like me) then I'm nothing going to stop you from watching it, otherwise, just skip it, rent the old one, or for your sake, go pick up a book. Oh.. I'm still afraid of Oompah-Loompahs!"
4,"I wanted to not like it, but...","This movie was better than the original (not to take any credit away from Gene Wilder because he was amazing in the first one). I have to say I understand the story a lot better this time around. The first movie had several confusing parts that were explained better in this version, and the story fits better with Tim Burton's warped view as director (as the story is warped in itself). The only criticism, which I am not alone in, is the Oompa Loompas, who were really annoying in this version. Although the songs were very clever, I could have done without them-a cross between rap and Saturday Night Fever. Johnny Depp does a great job as the creepy chocolate factory owner. Charlie is less annoying in this version than in the last. I wanted to dislike this movie because it was a remake, but I really liked it and would recommend it highly."
4,HILLARIOUS!!!!,"I LOVED this movie. I was O.K. about the first Willy Wonka, but this one was the best! It is so funny, and has great music. If you haven't seen this movie yet you have got to see this, it will become a favorite."
5,Charlie and The Chocolate Factory,"This will be diffrent from the 1971? movie. I hope there will be no singing. Johnny Depp wears gloves in the movie,but Gene Wilder did not. The kids are all cute.I'll ask for this on My birthday/christmas BTW: did you know Julie Dawn Cole[original Veruca Salt] that The shooting the scene with the Geese was shot on her birthday? It says so on the Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory DVD."
3,Depp is great and the move is a visual treat,It was a good film but not great. i found the direction to be great and the visuals to be great. The acting my Depp wasa great as Willy Wonka and all the kids did a great job. The story is where it fell i did not like all the flash back scene's and it did not show enough of the factory. I wish they would not focus as much on Charlie and his life and focus more on the factory. It seemend right when they got to the factory they fast forward the movie and it went by fast. The score was another good thing about the movie but I did not liek the ompa lompa's. Overall the movie was good but not great.
1,Depp stinks!!!!,"I hated this movie. All of the characters seemed blank and boring (the exception was the boy that played Charlie).And Depp's version of the character seemed like he was on Valium. The movie lacks the magic of the original, bigtime."
2,I hate remakes.,Especially when they don't come close to original. This one makes up a reason for why Wonka is soooo silly. The author didn't even do that in his book!! Not as good as the original.
1,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"TERRIBLE. This was the worst re-make I have ever seen. It was billed as ""Charlie"" and the Chocolate Factory, which made it sound as if it was a ""continuation"", not a ""re-make"". And, as far as I am concerned, nothing can compare to the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". However, I do enjoy a good re-make - but this was far from it. The characters were WAY overdone. The acting was terrible. Johnny Depp has done SO much better in other movies. He acted totally gay, and just stupid. I like Johnny Depp in general, he has done so many wonderful movies, but whoever wrote his part in this one just ruined it. Even in the original, Willy Wonka was NOT THAT excentric. He was at least ""living on the planet earth"", unlike how this Willy Wonka was portrayed. This new ""version"" of Willy Wonka went way too far, and it was just terrible. Neither I, nor any of the 5 others with me while we watched it, would ever see it again."
1,Stay away!,"Tim Burton should stay away from remakes! This is right up there with his disasterous remake of Planet of the Apes. Both inane and pointless. The differences between the original movie and the book do not warrant this remake. Johnny Depp is just creepy (and I usually like his work), and the Oompa Loompa was just plain wrong! Plus, the attempts to modernize the songs fall flat. Even the young actor playing Charlie, who was wonderful in Finding Neverland, is dull in this film as he whispers his way through. Do yourself a favor, rent the original, as I doubt this one will even be remembered in 10 years."
2,Tim Burton should stop remaking movies.,"He ruined Planet of the Apes and now has ruined The chocolate factory. If you go into this movie without comparing it to the original it's not bad, but if you make the mistake I did then you will be disapointed, and badly. I could go on and on, but I won't. I think my biggest complaint though is the song Pure Imagination isn't there. I can't write anymore just thinking about how this movie was destroyed is making me angry."
3,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition),"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition) being an updated version of the 1971 movie with Gene Wilder and stars Johnny Depp in the role as Willy Wonka. The special effects are ofcourse better and the sound is also better. However, the story line differs from the book in many ways as the 1971 version with Wilder does not. The musical numbers of the ompa lompas are also better in the 1971 movie. I love watching the Gene Wilder movie and watch it any time it shows on television. This movie I am not so sure if I have same affection towards. I wish I could give it 2.5/5 but since I can not then I give it a weak 3. 3/5."
3,Fun to watch,"Remakes rarley are as good to me as the original, but this one is good and I didn't find myself comparing them too much. And this one is actually a lot closer to the story that is in the book. I recomment both book and this movie."
2,I guess I'm not a big fan.,"I have to say that I am not familiar with anything that has to do with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of Willy Wonka prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!The film brings to the screen the story of a young boy whose dream of visiting the Chocolate Factory comes true. There he discovers all sorts of surprises that he never even dreamed existed.The acting is about average, the colors are nice and that's about it.In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top."
3,so so,this movie is nothing next to the original but it is stilla good movie the oompa loompas are a disapointment being oneperson but all in all its pretty good.p.s. love danny elfman!
2,Weirder and creepier than the original version: 2 1/2 stars,"First, I like Tim Burton as a director, I can't imagine any other director who could even attempt re-making Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The problem is that this version is too dark and creepy for kids and too silly for adults.The film has the usual Tim Burton touches: Johnny Depp as the star, Danny Elfman music, very creative art direction and weird characters. However, the musical numbers are terrible, completely uninspired. Also, the entire movie has this dark atmosphere, not really a barrel of laughs.I rented this film, avoiding paying $$ to see it at the theatre and I'm glad that I did. If you do buy it, don't pay too much."
2,Very bad movie!,"I only give this 2 stars because of the special effects and I am a easy going guy. But this movie sucked. Depp is portrayed as an idiot, and the overall acting in this one is a joke. Charlie's acting is at best 3 stars and the music sucked. Very bad film and a huge insult to Gene Wilder!"
1,Why does Tim Burton make children's movies?,"Having read the book, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory many, many times, it is easy to say that this movie does the book or the original movie no justice. My questions for director Tim Burton:Why is Willy Wonka so creepy??In the book he is a fun lovable character who Charlie gets a kick out of the whole story.Why is the factory look like something you would see in a Marylin Manson video?The chocolate factory should have been designed as a place of pure imagination and astonishment, not a place that would be fearful for the grim reaper.Many other questions: Why does Mike Teavee's dad look like a child molester? Why is Grandpa Joe a totally unlikable character? Why do the oompa-loompas still give me the creeps after watching this movie 3 nights ago.I wish that Tim Burton would have tried to make this movie for children instead of the mid-twentys goth crew."
2,Deplorably Uneven,"Stick with ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". I don't know what Depp and Burton were on when they made this one, but neither of them is up to their usual level. The feel of the movie was inconsistent and Depp couldn't seem to decide if his character was creepy, wise, childish...or maybe he *meant* to seem schizophrenic. The backstory bit was mostly a waste of time, the same goal could have been accomplished with about 1/3 of the time devoted to it. Parts of the movie were delightful, but overall I found it a waste of ticket money."
4,It looks good,"I have seen previews for this movie and it looks good. I don't know much about it now, but I will write another review later."
1,Depp Looks like a girl.,I HATED THIS MOVIE IT DID NOT STICK TO THE PLOT A AND JOHNNY DEPP LOOKS LIKE A GIRL.
1,I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD!!,This movie was so much worse then I thought it would be. It was terribly dark and has such a evil undertone that I would NEVER let my children watch it. Stick with the original Willy Wonka and don't waste your time or money on this one.
1,Willy Willy Go Home! Willy won't go home,"I saw the Roald Doal book adaptation of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and I think Johnny should get away from the Chocolate Factory and get aboard the Black Pearl, but he will next summer in ""Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest"" I thought the original was way better, it's a classic. This newis not. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan since Captain Jack Sparrow, but I like Gene Wilder better for Willy Wonka. Johnny only belongs on the Black Pearl from now on. ""Finding Neverland"" was very good, ""Secret Window"" was good and ""Sleepy Hollow"" as even better than ""Charles"" If your a Johnny Depp fan still give it a try and see how you get cinema cancer. As great as an actor Johnny is, I guess they can't be winners can they. He was weird in a gay manner."
5,CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY!!!!!!!!,"Hi I loved this movie when I saw it at the theaters and you should of seen my face when I heard about this movie! I am getting it when it comes out! It`s better then the old one(which really sucks) and it`s based on the book! my favorite characters were: Charlie,Mike And Willy Wonka! And Annasophia Robb(Violet) is soooo adorable! at least that`s what they say at tv.com!"
1,Stay Away From This Horrible Factory!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is absolutely horrible!Who cares if it`s a ""Two-Disk Deluxe Edition""!!!!That doesn`t make it any better,cause theres not a bonus feature that tells you how they made this movie so stupid and boring!Johnny Depp is usually a pretty good actor,but he`s a ridiculus Willy Wonka!And the Oompa Loompas are the dumbest things I have ever seen!They look like a bunch of really old mexican women!And some more things:They totally picked the wrong kid to play Mike Tevee!The Great Glass Elevator looks totally fake!!!Man,the first version was so much better!Buy it!Don`t buy this!"
2,Why did'nt they let Michael Jackson Star???,He would have been perfect...Johnny Depp seems to be doing a Jackson impressionmost of the time..definately for the children alone...
4,Just different... I still prefer the original more,"If you grew up watching ""Willie Wonka"", you may not enjoy this one as much: not as ""musical"" (at least not as romantic and human, so to speak -no ""Imagination"" or ""Golden Ticket"" songs, for example) and certainly not as deep of a message as the one you may take away with the original with Wilder.However, it has its own merits: the kid that plays Charlie is perfect, the movie as a whole comes across as pretty funny, indeed funnier than the original (Depp is able to pull of more laughs, as he was with ""Pirates..."") and also the effects, as expected, are WAY better! Last, there were some parts of the story that were developed a little more than in the original.As for those who have read about a comparison with Michael Jackson, yes: there's definitely something there. :DOverall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
2,I couldn't wait for the movie to end,"This was one of those movies that I couldn't wait to end...but I went because the kids wanted to see it. I normally like movies with Johnny Depp, but not this one! I will give it 2 stars because Johnny Depp's acting was still good (I just did not like the story line...and neither did my kids...they said it was too ""boring""). Maybe younger kids (ages 4-6) might like it better."
1,couldnt sit through it,"absolutely awful! I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, but this movie was so bad i don't have a large enough vocabulary to properly express it. I wanted to turn this movie off 30 minutes in, but my friends kept saying it will get better; eventually after another 20 minutes or so they gave up too(thank god)."
1,Senseless Version with NO Redeeming Qualities,"Saw the premiere. Waste of time. Burton will prob do much better with corpse bride. It is along the lines of a nightmare before Christmas. but about Charlie. Depp was typical Depp. Burton was typical Burton. The story, however, was told better the first time WITH music. don't give me the story how this is not a remake, but a more accurate to the book telling. Who cares?? There are much worse movies that vary from the book that should have been re-made long before this one. At many points I found myself waiting for one of the famous lines or songs only to see this film try hard not to be the first film. I hope the dahl family enjoys their more accurate junk. I feel bad for all the families that will get sucked into seeing this garbage with the whole family. At todays rates....ouch!! Just buy a copy of the old movie, microwave some popcorn, and sing along with the family instead. Sleepy Hollow and Scissorhands it ain't."
1,It may have been good...,I dont know because I fell asleep 20 minutes into it. What a boring scrum-diddly-DUD. I'll take the original with all its flaws. At least it kept me awake and wasnt a shallow reminder of a time when substance was more important than style.
3,Charlie and the Chocholate Factory,This one was not as good as the original and I think Johnny Depp should stick to what he is good at.
2,Poor streaming,"We had several issues with streaming this video. We had to start and stop several times, and the video would get ""stuck"" frequently"
5,Funny,"This film is...different. I mean well, its Tim Burton different. But Johnny Depp does a great job at this Willy Wonka. People say Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka was better, and some say Johnny Depp's is. But the truth is they are both equal. The original movie was great and so was the new one, they are just different movies and they have different charecters to tell the truth. Johnny Depp does a creepier but funnier kind of version, and Gene Wilder played him as more of a man with no background. But that is one great thing about the movie. It actually shows Willy Wonka's background, so you see him as more human, and thats a good thing. This movie is gonna go down as a classic film just like the original."
2,Awesome Tim Burton work! what happened to the deluxe?,"This is not doubt one of Tim Burton's greatest works next to Edward Scissorhands. And I've been so waiting to get the dvd in November, but all of a sudden Amazon.com has taken off the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Two-Disc Deluxe Edition) that is going to be released on November 8th, 2005. Why? It was obvisouly going to sell better than the 1disc widescreen edition. I don't know what Amazon.com is doing. Anyway if it doesn't get back before november 8th, I'm just gonna have to buy it in stores."
5,Don't Listen - Go See It and Enjoy,"Having never watched the Original Film Version or read the book, I have got to say that this movie blew me away. I generally think most Tim Burton movies are wierd and Johnny Depp is overated as an actor and more wierd than Tim Burton, but I have to say that they both exceeded any expectations that I had. The movie was a visual delight and the songs were wierd and catchy. Depp is as wierd as he always is but so what? He obviously hates the other four kids as anyone would and I enjoyed their deserved fates. For someone with low expectations, I was really entertained by this movie. Go see it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed."
1,This is just sad,"I like Johnny Depp. He's played many excellent roles. This is not one of them. It's not that he's not good here, it just that this should have never happened in the first place. It's a poor adaptation and pales in comparison to the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. I watched it with high hopes but I don't think anyone will ever be able to play Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder did. It wouldn't matter how good Depp played the role, he'll never be able to usurp Wilder's version from my mind. This version is mostly fine if you've never seen the original adaptation. But if you have seen it then this version is worthless. If you haven't seen it, then the old version represents a time bomb that you may eventually set off(by watching it) and subsequently ruin Depp's version for yourself."
2,Lame and disturbing,"This was a really creepy rendition of a great classic movie. Even thought the special-effects are many times better, this version of the story has lost all of the charm. Lame and disturbing. The original was much better.Not recommended."
5,Johnny can do no wrong,"I am a DIE HARD Johnny Depp fan. He can make ANY movie glow. This is a really good movie! I was worried it would detract from the original classic (which I have seen too many times to count) But, it was JUST different enough to flow on it's own.I HIGHLY recomend this movie!!!!"
2,An Ok Movie -- Go see the 1971 for a better version,"A typical Tim Burton film. Very big and bold graphically but it lacks the human touch of the original. The musical numbers are pretty good, but again I find that the originals were a bit better.If you only want to buy 1 movie get the 1971 original film. It is much better!"
3,Mediocore at best...,"Tim Burton's remaking of ""Charlie in the Chocolate Factory"" is mediocore at best. The special effects are decent, but Depp is the real problem here. His Willy Wonka is NOT an improvement on Gene Wilder's, and he doesnt really bring anything that special to the character or the film.If anything, he looks to young to play the part and comes off as rather creepy. And Burton's Oompa Loompas are a joke.Kids may enjoy it, but as a ""remake"" that improves on the original, this film fails.Overall, the movie looks beautiful but the original 1973 version is much better and more ""magical"". I did however thoroughly enjoy the ""squirrel scene"". That was the best part of the movie in this reviewers opinion.Average movie that's worth a one time viewing (whereas the original can be watched repeatedly and still manages to entertain)Recommened for kids only. Adults should stick to the original."
1,Don't let your kids watch this bizarre adaption of a great book,"I hate it when hollywood weirdos take a good book or movie and remake them in their own weird image. The book by Roald Dahl and the original movie starring Gene Wilder are wonderful. This movie does not follow the story and is scary to little kids. Basically, Mr. Wonka is a mental case who was abused by his scary dentist father. Avoid this."
3,Wonka is Creepy,"I enjoyed most scenes in the film except those with Johnny Depp,he comes across as a creepy pedophile.I know there are other actors that would have been better in this role(such as Jim Carrey) but Hollywood has some secret contract that says all Tim Burton films must star Johnny Depp.Johnny Depp is a good actor but this part didn't fit him.I still enjoy the original with Gene Wilder more because I grew up with it and it is a timeless classic."
4,Cool DVD enjoyed by the whole family,"My family enjoyed this movie in spite of several bad reviews, it was very cleverly done and never ceased to hold our attention. Our children six and almost three, ended up watching it three times in less than twenty four hours. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan and have to admit that this is the film that I least enjoyed seeing him star in, but it was a good story."
4,A Different Wonka!!!,"To be fair - this is not Gene Wilder's Wonka character, nor should it be confused with Wilder. Neither should it be measured against that earlier version, and I've seen the Wilder version many times. This is a very interesting film, and to the credit of Johnny Depp, he makes it his own. There are some different twists to the movie and other reviewers have highlighted them, and this review will only share that it was an enjoyable film, with an upbeat score, and some twists on the plot. Charlie still has his Grampa Joe, and his background as a former worker in the Chocolate Factory added some different drama to the film.If you're looking for something a little off the beaten path, but with some entertaining characters and music, you may want to check this film out. Recommended!!!"
2,Only Okay,"Not great things in the movie: Unmemorable songs, needlessly protracted ending, decision to have the Oompa Loompas played by a single actor just seemed cheesy.Good things: Looked great, and Johnny Depp's interpretation of Willie Wonka was excellent.So, I thought it was only okay."
2,Marred by Burton's Obsession With Psychology,"Visually, this film is wonderful, and it has many fine moments, right up until the very end.In the novel and in the original film, Wonka sees and appreciates Charlie's good heart and his love of family. When Charlie wins, he excitedly invites both Charlie and his family to live with him, no questions asked.The whole point of the original novel and movie is to show Charlie's big heartedness.True to form, Burton throws in his own dark, twisted touch; he gets hung up on the idea of Wonka as a socially maladjusted wierdo. In Burton's vision, Wonka can't comprehend Charlie's love of family.The story isn't supposed to be about Wonka, but about Charlie's big heart."
2,Not as good as the original...,I watched this movie with an open mind trying not to compare it to the original but it just does not stand up. Jonny depp should of come into this and acted the crazy fun guy he is but instead he ruins it with the crap he put out. Tim burtons whole idea that one person could be all of the oompa's was also very stretched. Some of the songs are very good but again they just try to hard and fall so short.
2,It wasn't that good!,I'm not going to give it one star because Tim Burton tried hard. I didn't really like it much. I can't say it's bad because Tim Burton is a genius and he does good at directing movies. He really did a great job. I didn't like the dialogue much because it was corny. I really did like Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka better than Gene Wilder because his performance was amazing. The songs were kind of annoying and I was about to leave the theater during the half of the movie. The new Oompa Lompa weren't funny in this one. I did like the set to the movie it was awesome but it was getting too long and I was about to fall asleep. I'm sorry Wonka fans I know a lot of you loved it but I hated it. It's not a stupid movie I just thought it was boring. It seemed like that kind of a movie what lil kids would enjoy more than adults.
1,"stupid, dull, boring","I thought ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was very, very, very boring. Everything about this movie sucks. The oompa loompa's songs are so stupid, and the little side story's of Willy Wonka's dad are... stupid. I have no clue if they're in the book or not. Johnny Depp is without a doubt the worst Willy Wonka ever. He reminded me of Micheal Jackson. How can this movie even compare to the 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?"" Gene Wilder was perfect as Willy Wonka. I would suggest that version of this piece of garbage anyday."
1,"Joyless and unfunny, but good for the emotionally handicapped","What this movie has in computerized special effects, it loses in character development, wit, humor, musical performance, and joy. In other words, it is another Tim Burton remake of a 70s flick (""Planet of the Apes"" should be considered a crime against humanity). Let's hope that in another 30 years, a better director comes along who is able to capture the frivolity of the original film, especially with its heavyhanded moralizing. Johnny Depp is forgettable in this movie as Willy Wonka, and all his lines fall flat. This movie has no laughs. Don't bother with it."
5,Review,I think this movie was the best! And this is coming from a kid who loves Johnny Depp. I really like this movie...but he is much hotter in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies...but hes still awesome!I think he did an awesome job playing Willy Wonka. Oh...and who ever said that his teeth look fake???there MUST be something wrong with you! Well anyways i think he looks awesome!
3,Courtesy Three Stars,"I watched this movie with the family and found it only mildly entertaining. Certainly the imagry was wonderful, yet, the story was only okay from my perspective. Sadly, ""just okay"" is not something that I ever expect from the talented duo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.I must confess also that the oompla loompa was pretty creepy and distracted me from the story.A bigger indicator for me {and parents looking for a good family movie} was the overall lack of appreciation and interest from my kids.I give this movie a three stars vote out of respect for Burton and Depp and the effort they put forth, but I think the true mark lies somewhere between two and three stars."
3,An interesting movie but...go with the original,"My family enjoyed watching this when it came out on DVD. However, there's no rush to watch this one the way there is to watch the original. Who could top Gene Wilder? And if the music's catchy, the kids take to it. Sure, the original had a few cheesy effects but at least it did get a treatment from the author of the book, Roald Dahl. What this one lacks are all the sly one-liners that Wonka throws out there, and of course the memorable ""Good day, SIR!"""
4,Surprisingly Decent,"I had expected to absolutely hate this film going in as I love the original and was surprised to find I didn't. Definitely darker in some ways than Gene Wilder's version which I think is why I am able to disentangle the two in my head. Biggest downside to the film was all of the Wonka ""back story"" - totally unnecessary in my opinion and bogged the film down a bit."
5,This Movie was soooooooooooo Good they better do a Movie on Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,"If your Tim Burton,Johnny Depp or any of the people who worked on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, If I were you I would Consider doing a Movie on Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. This Movie was so good and it has a lot of funny stuff. Especialy when Wilber Wonka forbiddens Willy Wonka do eat Candy because it would give you cabbedies. Reminds me of The FairlyOdd Parents Halloween Special were they go to the Dentist at the end. Overall this movie gets 5 stars."
4,mr. wonka,"charlie and the choco factrory was fantastic. i loved the writing and casting. it was a twisted version of the wonka we all loved.the umbas threw me off, them being computer shrunkin and all but besides that, Johnny Depp did an awesome job in showing humor and got everything right in playing his character's role.typed by her daughter colette<------------ x]"
5,Brilliant adaptation of Dahl's dark novel,"Visually stunning (but not to the detriment of the story). Musically amazing. Wickedly demented. Incredible casting. This is a movie to be enjoyed completely separately from the original big-screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's book. Dahl is a dark writer who borders on being suitable for children, and this movie is true to his vision. It's darkly touching, not candy-coated or softened-up in any way. Watch this movie to see a young boy triumph over adversity and an overgrown child come to find the family he never had,"
4,It's good,"It's like Combat flight Simulator, only it's better. It's got new planes and better enemy pilots."
3,Track listing - 2 songs,"For those interested, the track listing for this cd is:1. Legs - Shortened dance version2. Sharp Dressed Man - Promo versionThese songs are not the Eliminator versions. Legs is the same as on ZZ Top's Greatest Hits (and the video), but the end is shortened. Sharp Dressed Man is the full length promotional version that was played on album rock stations in 1983 shortly before the release of Eliminator. It sounds similar to the Eliminator version, the noticeable differences being slightly different drum cymbal tracks and a somewhat different ending guitar solo, which makes this a collector's item for hard core fans."
2,Too fragile,The design is great but the chin rest chipped immediately during installation. Must be not so good or dried out wood.
3,not quite frank,"If imitation is the best form of flattery, then Frank Sinatra would be flattered -- perhaps. A not-so-bad attempt to capture that smooth, upbeat groove-a-la-Frank, although at some points I was almost expecting the music to stop and someone to say ""hey, just kidding!"" But I was tapping my foot alot - and they say that's good for the foot muscles."
1,This book sucks I want to leave negative five stars - *****,"If you are interested in Huna do not buy this book. It is sad that books like this are written. If you want attention, denounce something that is good. How many people will read this piece of garbage before Max's books or other books on Huna and then not read anything more on Huna at all? What a shame. I have lived in Hawaii most of my life. I have read all of MFL's books as well as many others, and it turns out that a Wal-Mart Ouija board and an airhead can destroy a lifetime of research. The sad part is people who don't know anything about huna will believe her.I for one will never read another of Ms. Kaehr's books. How could I ever believe anything she says?Shame on you Ms. Kaehr!"
1,Let it be.,"There are adepts of Kahuna in present existence, and it'll remain so among many lifetimes, BECAUSE ""HUNA"" was/is to remain ""HUNA"", they(true and real kahuna's) KNOW and LIVE ""HUNA"", and it's authentic truth, for their very own life was its pact/bond in secrecy.The ""death prayer"" is alive and well, but brings forth a curse to its USER, 10X worse chaos than the USERS victim(s) suffered. The USER and their Immediate-Ohana lineage shall suffer all thru time, one-way-or-the-other.I personally prefer Ho'oponopono. It's an awesome system which fine-tunes situations, patterns, and negatives stacked on negatives.OK-den, gotta go!! PEACE PEOPLE!!"
4,Cute! Definatly worth the money!,"This video was pretty cool if your a leo fanatic. There is this really cute part where he leans in to the camera and says ""Im a really nice guy!"" it was so cute. That is my favorite part. You have to buy it just to see that part. There is also this wierd part where they are interviewing the principle of leo's high school and the guy keeps calling him ""leonard"" isn't that wierd? The guy doesnt even know his name! Anyway you have to buy it!!!!"
3,This was a informative line of Leo's life,"This document was a great way to really get your facts on Leonardo di Caprio. I thought I knew everything there was to know about him, but this videop taught me more than I ever imagined! Leo lovers, a great documentary!"
3,Arrived damaged,Seems really small. Arrived damaged.I will try to purchase an invertor and buy a regular 120 volt fry pan. Not good if you have a lot of food to cook at one time. Great for one person.
3,Works to an extent,"This is one of 3 circular polarizers that I own for my camera lenses. This filter works, but has a few flaws and drawbacks. For instance, while it will diminish the glare of windows, water and render LCD screens invisible, it does not remove all of that completely. With this filter turned to maximum effect, you can still make out reflections. Moreover, rather than making everything slightly darker, it also gives everything a bluish tint. While it may not be difficult to fix in post, it's annoying nonetheless.I'd recommend another filter, such as those by Tiffen for the photographer on the cheap."
4,perfect,"I read all the negative reviews along with all the good ones. I gambled and ordered it anyways. It came right on schedule and it was packaged good. I went out that day and used it with no issues at all. The only small nitpick, it is a little hard to screw on, and when you are turning the filter, I could see where it could come unscrewed from the lens."
2,Sunpak CF-7062 CP 72mm sold by Celltime Inc.,"Please be careful to check if the item you received is the same as it shown in the picture on the web. In the picture, you can see that ""MADE IN JAPAN"" is clearly printed on the frame of the filter. However, on the real item I received, I could not find ""MADE IN JAPAN"" anywhere. Instead, ""Made in China"" is printed on the box. Also, the list price the seller indicated is $129.95. All mislead you thought the item you were buying was made in Japan. As the item I received is not the same as described on the web, I had to return it to the seller."
4,"Polarizer Filter, Sunpak CF-7062","This item arrived promptly and performs exactly as expected, spinning freely to polarize the light and to protect the lens. I was a little surprised a few times when the lens fell off in my hands because it had worked its way loose from all my spinning. Other times, I couldn't UNthread it because the gnurled wheel against the lens is a little tough to get a grip on. Otherwise, very nice filter - makes a blue scene warm brown and vice versa."
3,"Great, until it fell off of my lens!","I don't know if this was due to my own stupid user error, or a fault of this filter, but it's worth mentioning. I lost this while hiking, with my camera dangling around my neck. I had this filter screwed into a UV filter, screwed into my lens.It worked great until I looked down and noticed it had fallen off. It's easy to accidentally loosen it when turning this filter to get the desired effect. Just a fair warning! If you get this great filter, make sure you keep it securely fastened to your lens!"
2,Sunpak CF-7062 Circular Polarizer,"A must for Digital Photography, especially on standard or longer lenses. Spend a few dollars more and get a good name brand like Hoya or B + W. I exchanged this one for a Hoya, and I am totally happy.After spending a lot of money for a great DSLR, why would you put a ""cheap"" piece of glass in front of your lens? The differences are probably too subtle for the everyday photographer to notice, but if you do start to publish your photos, you'll want the same quality of glass in front of your lens, as the quality of the glass in your lens.I am shooting with a Nikon D90, with a Nikon 18-200 lens."
4,Nice!,I really needed to give my coffee table a Christmas lift! I was pleased with how nice this looks. It really brought the room together. I just washed it and it wasn't in pieces when I pulled it out of the dryer
4,"Misleading name, but it does help get paperwork straight","OK, its an accordion file and they supply the labels. But for folks like me who keep all their receipts and other papers in one big messy bin, this accordion file is very useful. It helps you to get all the right papers sorted out, has neat little labels, and keep the papers together. You can pull just the papers you need out of that bin for tax time, and leave the rest in the bin for later.And getting it for free, hey, I am not complaining!"
4,Tax Organizer for 2002,I found this tool highly useful to pull together and organize all of my tax information. It's straightforward to use and will help those who are helpless.
3,Tomatoe Preserves,"Since Smucker's stopped making Tomatoe preserves avaiable in many groceries, I have missed them for the past several years. This is the first I have tried from a WebSite and they were very good, however, I expected a lot more tomatoe than was present and I would rate them as just a little bit too sweet. I consider the product I received to be Jam not preserves, but definitions vary in different locations. I plan to try other tomatoe preserves from internet sellers, but this product was satisfactory and I will purchase them again unless I find a more ""preserve like"" variety."
2,Didn't work but its alright,"I recently ordered the Peter, Paul and Mary ""In Concert"" cd. It was supposed to be a two-disk album. However, for whatever reasons, I only received one cd and it was the 2nd disk. However, my money was refunded promptly with no muss or fuss. I will try and order this 2-cd set again in the very near future."
2,disappointed,"It's not that I did not like this album. The music was fine. Since the album was from the sixties, the fidelity wasn't as good as albums recorded today. What a shame!"
3,The music is wonderful,I love what I received but I was expecting it to be a double cd and it was only a single....so half of what I was expecting didn't eventuate.
1,These are not JAVOedge adapters,"Was not aware that these are not manufactured or shipped by JAVOedge. These are generic branded adapters. Beware when buying, I'm not sure why the seller put JAVOedge's name on the ""manufactured by"" field. It is very misleading. I ended up buying the adapter again from JAVOedge:Cingular Blackjack i607 Port to 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Adapter"
2,Great Product,Great product. But every time you turn the volume up and down it makes a really loud clicking noise right in your ear. So I used mine for a day and then never used it again.Still a good product minus the loud clicking noise.
1,Adapter broke within 2 months,This adapter didn't last over two months even with the little usage that I had put it through. The plastic casing for the i607 port broke off and left exposed wires that ended up breaking as well.
3,Michael Thompson....not his greatest work,This book was a good information book to read. It did not offer the type of insights that I Was looking for when I bought this book.
5,A discovery you will never forget!!!,"Joe Stoshack (Stosh) always felt a tingling sensation when he held a baseball card, but one night something extraordinary happened - Something that will probably change his life forever!!!Stosh got hold of a Honus Wanger baseball card and wished he could meet Honus...then he woke up that night and there Honus was sitting on a chair. Stosh was amazed. He thought it was a dream, but it felt so real. But then about a day later Honus ask if he could see his time. So Stosh tried and when he woke up he was in a whole other time.Does Stosh get home? Is it a dream? Oh yeah - there is one thing I left out...you'll have to read the first of Stosh's baseball card adventures to find out!!!By Elayna B"
4,Honus and Me,"To start out my review, I would like to point out that ""Honus and Me"" is not correct grammar. It should be ""Honus and I"", but then again, ""Honus and Me"" sounds more like it's coming from a kid's point of view, and that's exactly where it comes from. Joe Stoshack tells the story of a strange feeling he gets when he holds a baseball card, and how it turns into something else. This book contains true information about Honus Wagner. I listened to the book on tape, and at the end, they explained some more about Honus. I'm not sure if that is in the book or not. The ending left something to be desired, I felt, but I still enjoyed it! I would definately recommend this book to any baseball fan!"
4,Great series!,"I am an elementary school teacher with a reluctant reader for a son! Go figure! I brought this book for him to read and he has loved it so far! I have already read Jackie and Me and absolutely loved it! My problem is that it mentions the ""n"" word 4 times. I am an African American and do not feel that elementary school kids are ready for this word. Others disagree with me but just be ready to explain the meaning of this word if you read Jackie and Me. Needless to say, I will not rush to make my son read it probably until at least 5th grade."
5,A great baseball book!,I like this book because I think it would be fun to travel back in time with Honus Wagner. I also liked it when Joe had to bat. I can't believe people couldn't tell who was Joe and who was honus Wagner!
4,I loved this adventure!!,"The book I am reviewing is Honus & Me written by Dan Gutman. I think this deserves four stars. It's a very good book because it is about baseball and adventure. It has the world's most valuable card. This book is about a boy who is not very good at baseball. One day he is cleaning his neighbor's house, who is very old. When he finds an old baseball card and a ripped picture of the old lady When he touches the card he feels a tingling feeling. When he holds the card long enough he goes into the year 1909. When he travels in time Honus asks him questions. Then he takes Joey (the boy) to the World Series game but the manager ripped the card. Honus gave Joey a new card and also gave him the other half of the picture. Last he is able to return to his own time and used what he learned. I'd recommend this book to a person who likes to read about adventure and sport history."
3,quick read,"It was an all-around good book. I liked it, because it was about baseball. I recommend this to you if you like short-quick sports books. I liked how his baseball cards are ""magical."""
3,Average Joe,"The book i read was Honus and Me by Dan Gutman. I thought that this book was an ok book because some parts of the book were not very clear and boring. The good things about this book is that it is a baseball series and and they have very good baseball player in it [Honus Wagner] and thats what makes this book good and interesting. If I had to rate this book i on a five star scale i would give it a 3 1/2 stars for this book because it was an average book cause of the weak parts. So I think that that you should read this book but you don't have too.6th Grader From Orono,Maine Christian Corneil"
5,pageturning fun for the young baseball reader,My 2nd grader has recently started reading this series. HONUS AND ME was quite the pageturner for him; my son really enjoyed it and learned baseball facts along the way.
3,Missing important concepts,"Here is an example of topics not covered: Employee Stock Options, Secondary Offerings and Stock Dilution. This text operates as if IPOs and treasury stocks are the only way to issue new shares. See the Motley Fool website for more details."
1,Lack of professionalism,"It has been five weeks since I purchased this product and there is no word from the seller of when will it arrive, if it does. Can you help me to track it down? I would greatly appreciated, thank you."
5,Days Like This,"Van Morrison is my soul hero of music... and this is my favorite.The lyrics, the music and the feel is all there."
3,"Good album,but lost a step or two on this one",Van Morrison is one of the greats and always will be. But this is for only diehard fans. His voice sounds great but the songs are not. I was disappointed.
2,So Disappointing,"I love Van Morrison and have done so for years. Veedon Fleece, St Dominic's Preview, Into The Music, Moondance, Enlightenment. I can't imagine my life without these albums. I would love to rate this CD better, but it is just so disappointing. Apart from 'Days Like This' and 'Ancient Highway' the dreadful backing vocals and utter, desperate sense of making songs just for the sake of it pervades this tedious, embarrassing album. There is precious little of any worth at all. If you are new to Van Morrison, please listen to something else, or you are likely to miss out on truly wonderful, inspiring music."
5,One of Van's best of the 90's,"This Van release from '95 really has an upbeat feel overall, and the recording, production, and horn arrangements are all very well done. I especially like the Van albums with Pee Wee Ellis arranging the horns, he makes a great musical partner. I don't think Shana Morrison is as bad as other reviewers have expressed, but I do think that the two songs with her are the weakest on the album. I especially like ""Perfect Fit"", ""Melancholia"", ""Songwriter"", and ""In the Afternoon"". I'm not so crazy about ""Ancient Highway,"" it just seems like a rehash of his common themes and is rather redundant. But the few flaws are easily overshadowed by the brilliancy of the other songs. This is a CD to be played over and over again and you don't get tired of it."
3,van knows there are days like this,van is old but he rules his fiancee is half his age and hes a songwriter so in other words hes getting his fancy tickled go van do the nasty buddy boy
4,Gets better with each listening,"The first time I listened to this album I was disappointed. Only ""Songwriter"" ""And Days Like This"" immediately struck me as any good. I gave it a second listen some days later and was surprised to hear some interesting things pop out that I missed the first time around. It's only gotten better with repeated listenings. This album has a way of growing on you...only one or two weak songs."
3,A Museum Piece. Interesting and Useless.,"As a trial lawyer and former assistant district attorney, I read this book expecting to learn the nuts and bolts of cross-examination. What a disappointment. The book is obsolete and contains virtually nothing of any use to today's trial lawyer. It's a fun read, and it's interesting to see some of the examinations excerpted, but using this book to learn to cross-examine is probably close to malpractice. There are excellent books and tapes on the topic if you want practical ""how to"" info. This isn't among them. Still, it's worth reading as a piece of legal history."
4,Great Book,"I purchased this for my fiance, he is in law school. Apparently he refers to it a lot because it so informative."
3,Art of Cross-Examination,"It is a collection of war stories, most applicable but some less so. Though is is of another age, mainly 19th, early 20th century, it does well illustrate basic principles of the craft. e. g., how critical it is to be familiar with the minutiae of a case in order to catch witness efforts to give sham testimony. Some examples are less likely to appear today when medical experts are more professional."
2,Lots of pages with little to offer,"I read this book after reading McElhaney's Trial Notebook. After reading the first book this one read so slowly, with so much wordage that I found it impossible to read. Not worth the money or the time."
5,"Profoundly important, spellbinding, heartbreaking story of a","An all-American boy realizes his life's dream to fly jets as an Air Force Officer. When he is called to action in the Gulf War, he leaves a wife and child and steps up to do his duty. From exposure to chemicals sprayed on his stateside base, then during the War, he develops Lou Gehrig's disease. Expecting support as a soldier and as an American, Donnelly is stunned to encounter government denials, even as mounting evidence grows about his and others' service-connected illness. Beautifully written with great dignity and courage, Falcon's Cry should be the call to righting the wrongs of government denial, before we lose even more good men and women. A must read!"
5,When is the movie coming out???,"Not too many books grab my heart as this one did. I felt like I was participating in the book myself! Both Denise and Michael did an excellent job bringing his story to life. I read the book when it first came out and I still continue to think about it often (two years later). Personally, I could see it made into a movie. At any rate, this is one book that is a must read in my opinion and well worth my money spent!"
3,it's cheap ..........!!!!!!!,reviewer #1 is correct! but any DEVO fan would love to add this CD... to his or her collection if for no other reason THE PRICE IS RIGHT.... for under $6.00 BUCKS you get a great line up of songs 5-live + 5-studio tracks....... its worth every penny!!!! THE MUSIC MONSTER.
3,Ok...,"Product on order, took a while to arrive, but all right, all within expectations, I recommend, it's worth, thanks ..."
2,slow delivery time,"I placed the order for this book on Janaury 11, 2010. When I checked the tracking information it said it was being sent from Virginia on Jan 12th. I did not receive this book until February 1st. I don't know why it would take 3 weeks to ship a book from Virginia to California. This book was for a college class for my son and he had to go two weeks of classes without a book. I would not recommend this seller if you want your order delivered in an reasonable amount of time.KarenPioneer, CA"
2,"Good Start, but Goes Downhill Fast","This movie starts out looking like a half-way decent, campy 80's style slasher flick, but it quickly degenerates into a very silly, not-so-scary yawn-a-thon. I give it two stars just because I think the first five minutes were pretty good (all things considered). But the villian is boring and the main characters aren't anybody you'll miss if they get killed. In fact, you'll probably find yourself cheering."
4,This CD Rocks!,"I figured out what song was missing in response to ojobe, it was Beast of Burden by the Rolling Stones, from when Tea Leoni sang to it in the shower. The talking Heads are awesome and set the stage for this soundtrack. The score Nick Cage sang to was pretty cool too. This is a good collection with a nice variety."
4,Nice soundtrack,"You can't go wrong with a sound track that includes ""Once in a Lifetime"" by the Talking Heads and ""One"" by you too. Hell, when nobody's looking, you can even jam to Mr. Big. To my disappointment though, the one song I really wanted to listen to was not on the soundtrack. It was played when Nicholas Cage sees Tea Leoni's character take a shower the first time. I think it went something like ""pretty, pretty girl..."". Would appreciate if anyone knew the title and artist. Really liked the movie."
3,???,"Does anyone know what song plays when Jack is opening the box with his stuff that Kate gave back to him? It's near the end, before he goes to the airport to stop Kate from leaving... unfortunately it's not on the soundtrack..."
3,HELP IM NOT CRAZY!!!,does anyone know the name of the song that is playing in the minivan when nic cage drops off the little girl for school before he goes to work at big ed's? i belive the verse is the crocidile goes... the reason i need to know is i came home pretty wasted one time from a party and heard someone in my neighborhood blasting this song beyond belief but my roommate didn't hear it and she thinks im crazy! i must find this song it was driving me nuts all morning when i was trying to fall asleep (i have to torture my roommate some morning). thanks!
4,pavarotti help,what is the opera that nicholas cage sings while in his sports car? I would like to know the title. thanks!
1,"Same book, different cover page.....",I bought this book hoping to get more practice given that I had the 2003 edition. This is virtually the same book with a different cover. An absolute waste of cash (i.e. if you have the 2003 edition). You'll be better off getting the GMAT Review book written by the test makers themsleves rather than waste money on this.
3,"Dissapointing CD, mediocre book","This book really adds very little to the information already dispened in the official GMAT guide. The CD is particularly bad. The animation is cheesy, slow and annoying and the content is quite removed from the content on actual exams. In the answers to many of the CAT exams presented on the CD, the author will advise you that your time is better spent ""going back and reviewing the answers you provided to previous question"" which is quite contrary to the nature of GMAT CAT exams where you are not able to go back to a question once a final answer is confirmed.There are some useful tricks and shortcuts on the CD, so definitely go ahead and purchase it, but this should only be used as supplemental material and not as your main study guide."
3,Princeton book is much better,"The 2004 Princeton review book has MUCH better tips and tricks for taking the GMAT. Their review is more in-depth and straightforward than the Kaplan book. I went through the Kaplan book first and often found it confusing or not going far enough with their explanations. Then, I went through the Princeton book and was surprised at how everything seemed much more useful. The CD in the Kaplan book is nice because it helps you to get your timing on questions down, but overall, the Princeton book is much better."
1,Misleading title. Virtually identical to 2003 edition,"This book's keyword ""2004"" is very misleading. I bought the 2003 edition in May and bought the 2004 edition in July, with the intention to do more practice problems. To my surprise, it is virtually identical to the 2003 version. Actually, as far as I can tell, only the cover page is different. I am extremely disappointed."
3,"Good introduction to the GMAT, but unrealistic!","I had no idea what the GMAT covered, so this book was a good introduction to each section with basic tips to approaching specific question types. The CD-rom was helpful and contains a lot of additional practice material.Don't let your performance on the CD CAT exams discourage you. I only gave this book three stars because the practice questions are so ridiculously hard that you consider signing up for their $1250 class. My Kaplan practice test results were as follows (in chronological order):- Paper 600- Diagnostic 590- CAT 1 550- CAT 2 550 (I was ready to give up at this point.)My scores from the ETS CD:- CAT 1 610- CAT 2 720My actual score was a 700. Do as many practice questions as you can, from this book and the ETS Official Guide to the GMAT. Good luck!"
1,"Poor help, if you're looking for new material","Unfourtunetely, I was expecting Kaplan's book to help me and develop my scores at GMAT. But this book didn't help me at all.The diagnostic test is the same as the year's 2000 edition. So if you are lucky and find it in some used bookstore don't even hesitate. All the extras added to this revision are usless. The online help that they promote in the cover are the same examples as in teh CD ROM.Added to this, I write a complain to the client service department, and three month later I'm still waiting for a response. Please consider t buy an older version of this book, it will save you money.If I have to highlight one advantage of this book will be the additional GMAT CAT TEST 4. But be aware if you do the paper based test first. You will find that most of the questions are going to be asked to you again in the CD ROM so one point less to KAPLAN 2004 edition."
5,Superb blues!,"Wow, I found this little jewel in the $5 rack at Walmart, of all places! It's a wonderful blues mix with a killer band that includes Junior Wells. Raitt has fantastic taste in music and chooses some great blues songs, including two by Sippie Wallace. Raitt contributes one of her own songs and it fits right in. Mighty tight woman, indeed."
5,Good Selection,"We used these trekking poles while hiking in theSmokies and they worked great, just as advertized."
3,good ol' pop punk,"The Spitfires 'In too Deep Again' is pretty much your average really-small-label, garage-band, pop-punk. The first song has really good guitars, and there are a few other semi-notable songs. Basically, don't set your hopes too high and you'll have fun listening to this album. If you like Blank 77s, you'll probably like this too."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I bought it so that I could read it to my kids and was excited when the book arrived. When I opened it to read some of the stories I found out that most of the words in the book are blurred and illegible. Not happy that I paid for something that I cannot use and will have to buy again from a reliable seller... I do not like it when individuals, or businesses, are not honest about their merchandize and would sell something that they themselves would not buy as a customer..."
1,Kindle edition no-nos,"The Kindle edition, as of 8-21-2011, has no table of contents, which it desperately needs, and horrible formatting. The html version at Project Gutenberg is better than this one. Hopefully some day these will all be fixed. It really sucks having to click though page after pager after page just to find the story you're looking for, when simply clicking it in the index would bring you there in no time.It's free. Download it and check it out for yourself.*edit*Someone in another color book review mentioned that there is a collection of all of these that is much better anyways. Check it out."
5,One of the best Fairy Books.,We've replaced this book several times over the years as it is a family favorite and gets a lot of use. Delightful stories. Enjoy!
4,Spooky Halloween Kit,"I love the kit! My son can't wait to go trick or treating with his new bag and flashlight. Only one problem with this kit. The flashlight..It doesn't take size C batteries, and it doesn't take size AA batteries...as a matter of fact...we are at a loss. We have no idea WHAT size batteries it takes. I have to tell you that this was a major disappointment. My son has this thing about flashlights, and that was really the main reason we bought the kit!So, maybe you can tell me, how do I get the flashlight to work? What size batteries DOES it take, and where can I find them?I hope that this is read, and that I get a response BEFORE halloween.Thank you,Tami Neff..."
3,Beware Transfer Speeds of U3 Drives,"What's the data transfer speeds? The benefit of U3 Technology is that they can boot/run software directly from the drive so transfer rates are a really important spec. I want a really fast U3 device on BOTH read and write. As of this date, transfer speeds of U3 drives are so disappointing that drive manufacturers won't show them. The only specs I've found shows that initial drives are only 40x or 6MBs. Current non-U3 speeds are as high as 150x or 22MBs. We need to know read and write speeds before buying!"
2,Can't replace U3 launchpad except with SanDisk non secure program,"Nice drive but went to the U3 site to update Launchpad program for Vista as directed. U3 site downloaded a sandisk program -- no indiaction that update applies to SanDisk drives only. By the time I figured that out, it was too late to use the vista update on the Verbatim site. The Verbatim site no longer recognized the drive as a ""Verbatim"" device. Neither Verbatim nor SanDisk support could/would help; both referred me to the other's support site. So, I am left with a U3 (SanDisk Launchpad) Verbatim drive that apparently does not and can not have a hardware ""security"" enable function -- which is what I bought the U3 drive for in the first place. So, I bought a new SanDisk U3 USB drive. Operator error? You bet, but one I couldn't seem to recover from without spending more money. You can research U3 and other flash drive security issues on [...]."
4,Nice little gaiter,Looked at similar ones in the shops and decided to purchase these as they sounded good and were half the price. These are lighweight and fold up next to nothing. They are made from thin material but fit nice and snug and will be great in summer when you need the protection but not the weight or heat from something bulkier.
4,solid gaiters,I bought these for my kili climb...they are well made and did what they are supposed to do. The only annoyance is that they trap moisture...not sure if there are gaiters that don't.
3,Good once you get them on,"Difficult to put on but they work well afterwards. They need to rethink the metal hook in the back, maybe with a snap or something."
3,Good quality hard to get on and off,When we use gaiters we typically snowshoe and have had zipper closures on other gaiters. Way easier to use when you need to pull up a sock or tighten boot laces.
2,Looks cheap,"This has a cheaply made look to it and the back of the frame keeps slipping out with the picture in it. Though I love most of the Malawi line, this item is an exception."
5,Gave as a gift...,"Rave reviews from the recipient, who can be a demanding critic. The hymn arrangements are fresh and a joy to listen to!!!"
3,Not Buddy's Best,I love to see and hear Buddy Greene sing. We saw him in concert and he was wonderful. I guess it is the selection of songs he chose to do for this album that was disappointing or maybe he recorded it before he got to be so good.
5,Wonderful CD,I would recommend this CD for anyone. I told my Bishop about this CD and he loves it too. It makes a great gift and lifts your spirits when you play it.
4,different side of salinger,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYFor many, The Catcher in the Rye is the extent of their exposure to Salinger. This novella exposes another facet of him."
5,A Wonderful Novel by a Gifted Writer!,"J.D. Salinger writes in a style that leaves the reader hungry for each and every page. Two stories that keep the reader interested, focused and wanting more.My high school aged daughter had this title on her required reading list and I can see why.A truly gifted writer."
3,Cynical and sarcastic,"Franny and Zooey was a good novel, but definitely very confusing. I found it interesting to read. It wasn't really a novel I liked, but wasn't one I disliked. It was originally 2 separate articles and was then turned into a book. I think that's why it was so confusing. The transition from the Franny article to the Zooey article wasn't very clear. I think the book teaches you about the insecurities and the obsession people can get when they become tied to some type of religion. The book wasn't very long, but it was very slow, some of the scenes were described very clearly, which made it quite long and sometimes boring. Overall, I would recommend this book, because it teaches you about the sarcasm and cynicism in a person."
1,painful,"I loved re-reading Catcher in the Rye awhile back and when a couple of my friends recommended Franny and Zooey swearing it was better, I couldn't wait to get into it. It started fine with dramatic tension between the neurotic college girl Franny and her ""Holden Caulfield like"" college boyfriend Lane. Then it all derailed with a new character, Franny's brother Zooey (another Holden) and this painful long back and forth wih his mother about what to do with poor mixed-up sister Franny. I wanted to like this book, but oh well."
3,Wise and Funny,"Franny and Zooey is a book is an examination of religious fanaticism and how that obscures the real worship of God, an interesting idea whose time never passes. Franny is a college age kid who thinks that a constant prayer is the only way to find God. Zooey is her older and wiseacre brother who has some thoughts on that topic.Their family structure is a precursor to the family in the ROYAL TENEBAUMS, if you've seen the movie. The book is sharp and funny and even insightful. It would make a good stage play as most of the book is dialogue and it takes place in just two settings.If you are reading it as a follow up to CATCHER IN THE RYE, you'll get a different experience here. It is more talky whereas CATCHER was more of an adventure. I enjoyed Franny and Zooey, but probably more so after I had finished reading it."
3,yawn,This book is good but very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very boring!!!
3,Unsatisfying,"... Plus i enjoyed The Catcher In The Rye and To Esme With Love And Squalour so i thought i'd see if this one was up to the same standards. It tells the story of Franny and Zooey, brother and sister from a precocious family of radio stars. Franny seems to have a nervous breakdown and turns a bit religious, and spends much of the book lying on a couch crying and repeating ""Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me"" in an attempt to find spiritual fulfillment, while Zooey offers her his heartfelt advice. I didn't fancy this book much, I thought The Catcher In The Rye was a far superior portrayal of youthful alienation and dissatisfaction and the way the characters spoke was really irritating me by the end. Plus it was awful short. I like a book you can get stuck right into, not one that you can read in about an hour and a half. However if you're torn between watching crappy daytime TV and reading this book, you should definetely read the book."
3,Reads like a French New Wave film,"If you like New Wave movies and would like to enjoy one in written words, then this is the book for you."
2,"Lacking, wandering: similar to many ""classics""","With all due respect to Salinger fans, I found this lacking. The only entertaining thing, in my eyes, was the references to Jappam and the meditations. Still, as far as the ""story"" itself, there wasn't much of one. Though I'm not a huge fan of ""Catcher in the Rye"" either, at least that one took you through the life of a boy. This one left you in an apartment and let you hear them talk. Oh boy."
1,A Waste of Time,"After disciovering (and falling in love with) ""Catcher in the Rye"" for the first time, I quickly picked this book up next but was sorely dissapointed. The themes here are similar to ""Catcher"" (angst ridden youths, the phoniness of modern day society) but where Holden Caufield was an intruiging and symapthetic character, Franny is underrdeveloped and Zooey is smug and unlikable. I was actually surprised to discover how little I got out of this novel and in the end I consider it to be a waste of my time."
2,What a snooze!,"Wow, two hundred pages of useless banter with no action. Why this is an adored classic, I really don't know. What a snooze!"
1,Is Holden Dead?,"C'mon--this book stinks. It could be so good but is so phony in its ""depth"" that it becomes unreal and unbelievable. It's just more junk from Salinger's post-Catcher in the Rye insanity."
5,Beautiful,"I first read this a few years ago, and, back then, it was just a driveling story about two elitist people talking about how they are better than everybody. I decided a couple weeks ago to pick this book up again. This is social commentary at its best, and it was written more than 50 years ago and still applies today. This is at least as good as The Catcher in the Rye! Read it more than once to get the most out of it like I did. HIGHLY recommended little book."
2,Crimony J.D. Your characters smoke too much!,"""Zooey"" opens with Zooey taking a bath and for the next 68! pages he never leaves the bathroom. Denouement occurs when Zooey draws shut the shower curtain so Bessie, his mother, can enter the bathroom. Zooey and Bessie engage in a Verbal Karate match and accomplish nothing save the lighting, dragging on, and extinguishing of countless cigarettes.Oh yes - the medicine cabinet swings open incessantly, afterwhich, Zooey explains that his sister's hysteria is due to her poor choice in reading material. The entire 68 page bathroom scene is lightly punctuated by a delightful orange cuticle stick and several passive cameos from a blue bathmat. And more cigarettes: On the frosted-glass ledge and on the built-in enamel soap catch.Read ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" by Robert M. Pirsig. It has all the Mystic Flavor of ""Franny and Zooey"" without the Tar and Nicotine."
2,"J. Smith, California","My favorite novelist and short story writer is J. D. Salinger. However, his novel Franny and Zooey was a huge disappointment. His writing is excellent. The characters aren't. I had no interest in them. I became totally bored before reading half the novel. What a shame. The first chapter, however, was a joy to read. The remaining chapters weren't."
1,A Trifle Thoughtful Story,"Contrary to popular belief, I believe this is one story-not two-and would go as far as to say that anyone thinking this novel was two separate stories, or even two interrelated separate stories, must have missed the boat all together. The story of Franny and Zooey is about a brother and sister, whom you are persuaded (rather weakly) to believe were the victims of their older siblings' religious influences. What a bore. Salinger's philosophical spewing is elementary at best. As a side note, Salinger used the word ""trifle"" a trifle too many times (every four pages to be exact-- check it out)."
2,Despite my fear of being accused of...,"not being hip, I must venture out and say:Oh my God!!! What???? Who cares? Franny is pregnant. The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s. But beyond that, what's the point? Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood. Boring in the 50s and boring now.As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey. Holden was familiar. Franny and Zooey made me want to shower. I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of..."
2,"not that great, to tell the truth","this book is in two parts. the first is called franny. the second is zooey. the first part about franny is much better than the second part. i am still on the second part actually, and i can't get through the stupid scene where zooey is in the bath. it goes on for about 50 pages, and it is the same conversation over and over again. I want to scream i am so annoyed. salinger could have showed the reader what he wanted to express in 2/50ths of what he did. one other problem i find to be true about his writing is that he writes about god and prayer and stuff like everyone who reads his books will be a devout christian or whatever. I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD, so sue me. he thinks that everyone in the world is like that, and it is annoying. that's all i have to say about this book."
4,Entertaining and intelligent,"Franny and Zooey is not really a single novel. Rather, it's more like two novellas, though the novellas have overlapping characters. These stories, originally published in The New Yorker magazine, concern Franny and Zooey Glass, two members of the family that was the subject of most of Salinger's short fiction (and also the Wes Anderson movie The Royal Tannenbaums). Franny is an intellectually precocious late adolescent who tries to attain spiritual purification by obsessively reiterating the ""Jesus prayer"" as an antidote to the perceived superficiality and corruptness of life. She subsequently suffers a nervous breakdown. In the second story, her next older brother, Zooey, attempts to heal Franny by pointing out that her constant repetition of the ""Jesus prayer"" is as self-involved and egotistical as the egotism against which she rails. Entertaining and intelligent."
3,Great book - horrible copy,"Don't buy the massmarket paperback .. very bad quality print and awful size/design. Get one of the better versions, or the hardcover.Great book, deserves the best medium and presentation, not cheap paper and runny ink."
5,Beautiful,This book is JD Salinger's finest. The characters are wonderfully crafted. Zooey and Bessie are laugh out loud funny. In this book Salinger encapsulates familial love to an unsurpassed degree. I cannot reccommend this book enough.
5,This book is about a disfunctional family.,"Franny and Zooey is a deep book about a disfunctional family. Franny is a young college student who becomes obsessed with reading and reciting prayers from her ""Jesus Prayer Book"". She has just had a nervous break down after a short visit with her boyfriend, Lane, away at school. During the second story, she is struggling with her relationship with her mother, her brother Zooey, and her obsession with her prayer book. Also in the second story, her brother Zooey tries to help Franny by trying to make her realize that her obsession with this prayer book is unhealthy. He says that it is superficial. Throughout the book, the family members struggle to cope with one another."
5,This book is an American classic!!!,"I think that although it is variable mis-understood it is truely a snapshot into another frame. If you don't like this book thats ok, but keep that to yourself!! You have to read a copy of Salinger to understand what the dialoge is. Not incoherent but a cosmic infident to be relished not ridiculed."
5,Those of you who gave this book a bad review lack insight...,"I feel that this book is fantastic and should in no way be compared to ""Catcher"" because the content is much different. For those of you who said it was too full of ""pointless"" dialouge fail to look into what the book is trying to say (as do those people who criticize ""Catcher""). If you fail to look beyond the surface then the message will be lost on you. For those of you who have the ability to take a book for more than surface value you will really enjoy this book. Those of you who can't will not enjoy this book and I doubt could enjoy any book of any real value. In my opinion it's sad to see people giving this book a bad review just because they lack insight. It's even worse when they decide to not even give a name or e-mail address when they post an unfounded comment like that. I hope future readers of this wonderful book will be more open minded."
4,Not Pregnant,"Okay, let's talk about the whole Franny being pregnant issue and why it is completely wrong. Seymour, the guy that died, was having the same problems as Franny and I'm pretty sure he wasn't pregnant. In his other book, Holden was pretty near a breakdown too, and for some unexplained reason, I don't think he was pregnant either. The whole too long a time between sips or drinks or whatever doesn't prove anything because she is far away from him. All it shows is that she really doesn't like him which is pretty obvious anyway. She doesn't need to be having a baby not to want to be with him.I don't think the book loses meaning either. I think it loses its real meaning when you think she's pregnant. Putting the issue aside for a minute, I think it really is a good book, and I think that if you like salinger it's very good."
4,The Spirit and the Body,"Contrary to your helpful guide, this is a book about a young woman at a moment of spiritual crisis -- not someone in college who finds herself pregnant! This notion has been making the rounds since the story was first published in The New Yorker, in 1955. The first section of the book gives us a fairly objective view of Franny Glass and her life. The second section, thornier and more complex, puts her in the context of a complicated and demanding family, and we can fairly see her crisis in the making. Please reconsider how you present this book to the novice reader"
5,Do you know who the Fat Lady really is?,"If you are a philosopher at heart and immensely interestedin the human psyche, then this book is integral for thought.I am not just writing this because I am fascinated by J.D.Salinger, rather these two stories explore religion,pyschology, the bonds among family members, and theeverpresent quest for a unique vision of life.""Franny"" is the story of a troubled philosophical girl whois struggling to reconcile her thoughts on her world purposeand the conventions of daily existence. ""Zooey"" is the confidentolder brother who understands many things that his sister doesnot. These stories, especially ""Zooey"" have humor, sadness,cynicism, and joy. For anyone who is always questioningand looking for an answer, Salinger speaks to thatquestioning voice and offers his own idea of who the Fat Ladyreally is."
2,Quite boring till the last few pages,"I'm a pretty big J.D. Salinger fan, having previously read The Catcher in the Rye and Nine Stories and enjoyed both but with this book I found it very hard to finish, despite the fact that it is only 202 pages. Its pretty slow reading and not a lot is happening in the book. It all basically takes place in the Glass flat in NYC and there are 4 main characters, Franny, Zooey, Franny's mother and boyfriend. It's all about the Jesus Prayer and finding out about religion for Franny and how she lives her life.All Salinger is doing in this book is putting down some tidbit of his philosophy down in fiction form with characters. Only real big Salinger fans should attempt to read this and if you're only wanting to read a Salinger book stick with The Cathcher in the Rye."
4,Read it for school and enjoyed it.,"""Franny and Zoe"" was an excellent book. J.D. Salinger wonderously described a brother and sister searching for meaning in their lives through religion. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who likes J.D. Salinger's writing."
5,Interesting and Beautiful,"Franny and Zooey is an excellent book that forces the reader to get into the characters' heads and draws the reader into a search within oneself. It is a beautifully written story of two people who know that they are different and that phony people are everywhere. Franny becomes obsessed with the ""Jesus prayer"", and has a nervous breakdown. Zooey shows Franny that her obsession with the ""Jesus prayer"" is just another example of phoniness. This book really allows the reader to get wrapped up in the characters and identify with the characters in a wonderful way. A very incredible book."
3,too much dialogue,"Good, yeah. But the pontification of the characters gets a little tedious, and I found myself losing interest here and there. Good and poignant points are made, and overall a good effort, but not quite a page turner"
3,This book was very confusing,"Maybe I wasn't really paying attention as I read this book, but I found FRANNY & ZOOEY to be very, very confusing. The only things I really understood where the Jesus prayer and the situation of Seymour Glass. I lost the inner meaning (if there was one) of this book along the way, and I found this book to be pretty confusing. But the parts I did understand were good. So, 3 stars."
1,"strange, convoluted book","maybe it's just me, but I just didn't get this book. it's too heavy and deep. it didn't make any sense to me. it's also boring in a lot of parts!"
2,My Rave Review,I gave this book two stars and it' pretty darn lucky to get that much. I couldn't understand it. I found it boring and I felt that the book it self rambled on.
2,"It was very long, confusing and pessimistic","I didn't like this novel. It wasn't very long, but it was so slow. It didn't really have a clear theme or conflict. The characters were very confusing. It was hard to follow their actions. Franny is an immature girl, who needs help and doesn't want to receive it. Zooey is an sarcastic, cynical and very unpleasant. I didn't really like how it was divided up into sections. At first it starts out with Franny, and a couple of pages later, it turns into Zooey, making it a very rough transition. They were originally two newspaper articles. After reading Catcher in The Rye, and liking it, I thought this novel would be worthwhile, but it turned out to be a total waste of time."
3,pretty good cut,i use to really dig this cut back in the day. it was real laid back&it was a cool cut.i dug the basic elements of this cut.this song takes me back to a Lady that I use to like for a while.real smooth cut.
5,Grammar in Use Intermediate Workbook w. Answers,This is a great book for classroom use or independent student use. I teach ESL classes for adults.
4,Grammar in use,This is an excellent book for teaching students enjoy the exercises and find them a good self study and practice reference.
3,disappointing,"I own all of Caron's records, and have listened to them many times. This is the last album I bought. There are some killer grooves here, and the sound in general is really nice and interesting. Great sounds, great mix. On the other hand I can't really find the soul in this album. it feels very mechanic to me and even the bass solos sound very repetitive, with the familiar Caron phrases played over and over again. If I had to give up 1 Caron album this would be it. Again, not saying it's bad, but not up to my expectations compared to the other records."
4,"Good tunes, good playing","I like the arrangements of the pieces, the playing as well. I think on the whole a good set of songs. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I prefer music to be a little faster."
5,Death and Rebirth,"""That's it for the Other One"" is the best musical evocation of death and rebirth I know of. It is trip through the Tibetan Book of the Dead. No wonder the Dead are Grateful."
4,not what most people expect from the dead,"if you are looking for some 'american beauty' kind of dead, this isnt it. however...this is one crazy cd. you will probably enjoy it more when ur stoned or tripping...but all music is better that way...this is some far-out grateful dead stuff...like alligator is crazy, and so is born cross eyed. i dont know, if ur into psychedelic trippy amazing music BUY THIS"
3,OK the Grateful Dead (...) but listen to this,"This is the reason why the Dead are a Psychedelic band pure and simple. I never quite got into them too deeply, (too hippie peace love smell the flowers) but this is very good.The whole CD is a sort of concept album not unlike Dark Side of the Moon, the main thing that makes this so good is the production. Im sure the original takes were much more lazy and slowed down but the finished product got chopped into something that is actually worth hearing. Splices and overdubs actually sound good with this.This is pure psychedelia and even though i cannot stand the Dead this CD gets played from time to time."
4,"strange and delightful, early Dead effort","just reading the names of the songs will hint at the strangeness of this cd. Well, most of the songs aren't that strange, but there are occasional moments that are odd. It has a mellow bluegrass feel, like almost all Dead cd's, and is often thought of as one of their strongest cds. I wouldn't say it is their best, but it is interesting and worthwhile if you have checked out their mainstream stuff first. This was back before the Dead really came into their element; if you are a new fan I would recommend getting Europe 72 or American Beauty or something like that, then check this out. It is strange and interesting. Another good cd from this period is Live/Dead, which is very good and classic Dead that you shouldn't miss."
3,good but not great,"Yes, Anthem of the Sun is a good album, but definitly not one of the greatest unless you are into the extremly trippy music they recorded. Anthem of the Sun is not up there with American Beauty, Europe '72, and Workingman's Dead. The lyrics are also hard to hear even in the remastered version. On the upside, though, Alligator and Caution are very well done. Anthem of the Sun is a good album for any deadheads collection, not for anyone else."
1,Mostly unlistenable,"I have heard virtually all of the Dead's recorded output and generally like them, but isn't this really an album which is more interesting to think about than it is fun to actually listen to? A grand experiment which mostly failed. Needed a rigorous editing job and someone to say ""no"" to the excesses which wreck it. The live versions of these songs on other Dead albums, recorded during the same time period, are far superior."
4,"Writer Donald ""Silver"" Cameron's Tour of Cape Breton Island","Anyone who enjoys sailing, geography, nature and down-to-earth people will enjoy this book. I have never been to Nova-Scotia and, yet, after reading this book, I feel I can smell the scent of the air over there, I can picture the numerous coves strewn along its rugged shoreline and, best of all, I get this sense of having been there and having met its inhabitants. A truely magical book"
4,Her voice woke me out of a deep sleep.,"My clock radio goes off at 5 am. A few days ago i was listening to NPR when they aired a profile of Ana Egge. Her voice was so beautiful that it woke me out of a sound sleep. Unfortunately it wasn't soon enough to catch her name. After searching all over the Web I tracked down this CD. It was well worth the effort. She has a lovely voice. While I don't usually listen to country music, this album is fresh and lively and goes beyond the usual cliches of country lyrics and music. Thanks NPR!"
2,Dsappointed,I bought 3 vintage Mattel electronic hand held games. Paid about 8 times more for the basketball game but since I got such a great deal on the other two and really needed all three I went ahead and made the purchase. Very disappointed. The sound did not work. I changed the batteries twice hoping that was the problem but it was not. Contacted the seller but never heard back.
2,I Guess Only A Collector Would Know,"I ordered this album based on the cover. The album pictured is the original photo, which is uncensored. It's Alice with his thumb through the crotch of his pants. The record company quickly decided this was inappropriate and pulled this printing. They released a picture with his thumb covered up. It's a rarity to find the uncensored cover and I thought I had found one. I received the censored one. Record collectors know better, records sellers should too."
3,Wish It Was Better,"Cant say that this is a big improvement over the original Warner's cd of ""Love It To Death"", Although it is now the best version available"
1,WHERE'S RHINO WHEN YOU NEED THEM?,"This review is for the Audio Fidelity release of this album, not for the album itself.I had been patiently waiting for years for this album to get the same deluxe treatment as Rhino gave BILLION DOLLAR BABIES. What a disappointment it was to discover that LOVE IT TO DEATH, my all-time favorite Alice Cooper album, was in the hands of Audio Fidelity. I, regrettably, purchased their edition of SCHOOL'S OUT when it was first released in 2009 and couldn't believe that that was the best they could do for the price they were asking. Not that I was expecting them to replicate the original paper panties of the vinyl version, but a bonus cut or two or even a booklet with liner notes would've helped justify the price. The barely noticeable so-called improvement in sound quality alone was certainly not worth it. I would love to know why Rhino dropped the ball on further Alice Cooper reissues."
4,Warner Brothers should be ashamed of these releases....,"First off, all of the original Alice Cooper band albums are more than worthwhile. Get them all....on vinyl that is.These low priced CD's that Warner Brothers is peddeling are the original transfers from back when the CD was first introduced. Terrible hiss and poor sound quality make these unlistenable in my opinion. I have MP3's and cassettes of these albums that sound much better than these factory WB CD releases do.I also own all of them on vinyl and can firmly attest that the AC band catalouge is in DIRE need of a remaster. Save your bucks until that happens or listen on vinyl/cassette until then. Don't encourage these guys. Shame on you Warner Brothers for continuing to sell such outdated/poor quality transfers!!"
1,Disappointing!,This is one of my all time favorite albums.There isn't a bad song on the whole thing.I've been waiting for years for a proper remaster.My gripe is with the sound.This is 24 bit map remaster?It doesn't sound any better than the original cd release that Warners put out in the 80's.Only more expensive.The volume is low and the clarity sounds the same as the original.This is the best they could do?Save your money.
5,Love it to Death CD,Excellent Alice Cooper Album. Arrived on time and in great conditon.I would recomend this CD to any Alice Cooper fan
4,worth it,"This was the only Alice album that I had not heard in my 50 years. For seven bucks it contains several great rock songs, plus the classic ""18"", and the standard and weird but fun Alice slower songs like Dwight Frye."
5,a masterpiece,"This disc is a masterpiece, every song is good on this record, if you like this one, you should get their record ""Killer"".."
4,In a league of its own,"This was the first Alice Cooper album I ever heard, and along with Killer and Billion Dollar Babies it is the best work he has done. Love It To Death isn't for everyone, some of the music is a bit strange, and it can't all fit neatly into the rock genre. But, that is why I like it, it set Alice apart, and the lyrics made you think, Imagine my surprise when 20 years later I learned that Dwight Frye was the name of the actor who played Renfrew(asylum inmate who ate flies) in the original 1931 Dracula movie. Add to that I'm Eighteen, which acurately describes the conflicting emotions of boys that age and yo have a grteat album. So, if you want to listen to the album tha launched Alice Cooper to superstardom, this is where he really took of."
5,A Classic That Never Grows Old. 5 STARS *****,"I was thinking it was about that time in which I ramble on about a classic that I gew up with. This was my first intro to Alice Cooper when I was 15, picked up his greatest hits tape he had out back then, and really blew my mind out when I grabbed hold of a copy of, Billion Dollar Babies.Most everyone will remember this album for Eighteen, but for me, it was the ultimate track, Ballad of Dwight Fry! This song is demented, sad, it rocks, and if you've ever seen Alice Cooper do it live, in the straight jacket, you know the crowd goes as nuts for it as all the other old tunes.Every track on this one is a gem to behold. Whether you're into hard rock, hard core heavy metal, power metal, etc. This one's an essential.5 STARS FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF METAL, USA."
5,LOVE IT TO DEATH,Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this NOW. I've had this album for over 30 years and I still can't get enough of it. That is all I am going to say!
3,rate product,"No defects on arrival, but i only gave it a 3 because i didn't use it for its intended use."
4,Hysterical -- and sometimes HOT,"These stories are wonderful -- seems like the pen names used to protect the innocent really let people go all out with the tell-all. And some of the stories are HOT! I keep forwarding snipets to my friends saying ""you've got to hear this one!"""
1,I wish I could give this book a negative rating!,"I would have to rate this book up there as one of the worst I've ever read. The author talks about people speaking freely because they were anonymous, I think it was more along the lines of people exaggerating freely because they were anonymous. I don't see how people in Silicon Valley have the time for sex at all, they are too busy online in chat rooms, playing with themselves while online in chat rooms and taking stupid surveys. Give us all a break, we don't need a sequel to this one."
1,So bad I may have to not use it,"When they packaged this hose, they put zip ties on it and crushed it. You can see this in their own photo. I've had this hose laid out across my floor, hoping these crush spots will come out, for several weeks now. They are not coming out. I've pumped hot water through the hose, nothing. The water flow from my pump is cut in half by the crush zones. If I hold the hose just so, and squeeze a couple of the crush spots to open them with my hand, the pump works reasonably well but not as well as it could. The material of the hose seems to be of a strong, somewhat flexible, and otherwise good quality but the people who package it don't seem to have a clue. I suppose if you were putting 50psi house water through it Those crushed spots might expand but my 2500 gph pump can't do it."
2,so-so,"This book is not what I expected--I had expected an approach from a theoretical point of view. Instead, this book offers a lot of ""general"" techniques/advices that I did not find particularly helpful. Furthermore, this book concentrates on scenarios in a work setting, rather than daily encounters, and perhaps that is also another source of disappointment. I felt a lot of advices are ""common sense"", but then I have some exposure to this kind of books. I would say if you have no working experience (hence have never confronted situations presented in the book), you may consider this book as a starter. If you are looking for something more, try some other book."
4,"Solid, but not superb like his first disc","Glemser's volume 1 is a must-buy disc, but this a tad weaker. Despite this, his performance of the youthful unpublished Eb minor sonata is the best of the four I've heard. The third sonata is played very well, eclipsed only by Ruth Laredo and Vladimir Horowitz. It is tied with Robert Taub and Vladimir Sofronitsky. The tenth is a bit bland here. For that piece, I suggest Robert Taub and Vladimir Horowitz. Vers la flamme is better with Sofronitsky and Horowitz. Glemser is an excellent Scriabin interpreter, but if you're only going to get one of his discs, stick with the first."
2,Ordered the wrong CD,"Ordered this CD in error,listened to it & didn't much care for it. I'll add it to my collection. PS My girlfriend liked it."
4,A Tony Hillerman tale,"A short book and fun to read. Hillerman was always good and this is no exception. It is not the well written and more complex novel we would expect from him, but well worth the time to read it."
5,Great!,For anyone taking engineering classes I highly recommend this tool. It was very helpful when it came to detailed drawings.
3,Not the quality you remember,"These are not built like the old ones, I would look for a second hand one in a flea market. But it is functional."
4,"Good Deal, Great price","This was exactly what I was looking for. In this day of anime violence and off-color innuendo in kid's programming, I have been picking up DVDs of entertainment from my own childhood to share with my grandchildren...and they love it!!! They even go around singing the songs from the movie, corny as they are."
3,cute,What can I say about these movies abbott and costello made in the 50's. They did a cute job on this fairy tale story. Always good to see again and again.
2,silly Abbott & Costello,this movie is typical of the Abbott and Costello fare. Kids should find it amusing.
2,This is NOT a Restored/Digitalized Transfer,"This DVD was a major disappointment! I'm talking about the so-called restored/digital transfer of the movie. If this is so, then my VHS video tape of it was also restored & digitalized. This was obviously made from the same 16mm print that is floating out there in the public domain. The movie itself is entertaining, though."
4,Hilarious for the kids,My 9 year old roared with laughter when we picked up a cheap VHS copy at a drugstore. The much better version on DVD purchased here was much better because the transfer quality was superior
3,A Fun Little Movie,"""Jack And The Beanstalk"" starring Bud Abbott & Lou Costello is a fun little movie for kids and 'kids at heart'. It starts out in black and white and changes to color when telling the story about Jack And The Beanstalk. (Unfortunately, they skimped on production costs.)[Review by 'Ypsilee']"
3,I HAD EXPECTED MUCH MORE,"It was my first experience with IQ. I had read a lot of reviews and I chose the best in terms of reviewers. I confess I'm disappointed. Now, I will forget IQ. Anything catch me, even an only song. The vocals are so high."
2,Subterranea is Subpar,"I'm glad this was not my first IQ cd I ever heard. The only song I ever listen to on this CD with any ""Frequency"" is the title track Subterranea, great song with excellent guitar play. The rest sounds like some concept album that never really had any direction or substance. Fortunately my first two IQ cds were ""Dark Matter"" and ""Seventh House"". Those are their finest works and I listen to them all the time. Skip this one."
4,good,"I think IQ deserves credit for carrying on the kind of songwriting that was mainly dominated in the 80's as far as progressive rock/metal is concerned.Subterranea is a pretty melodic album that is extremely reminiscent of the 80's metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Dio, and Queensryche. There's a lot of melody (something that pleases me personally) and a fair amount of guitar work that's pretty neat.If for nothing else, this album definitely has a cool atmosphere to it that makes you want to dream, expand your mind, and just be free to absorb the magical adventure that awaits. I don't deny there's an ever slight cheesy sound going on, but most 80's metal bands were guilty of the same thing and the quality of the songwriting didn't drop *too* much as a result.I like the album. I think IQ is definitely a band that's heading in the right direction as far as the future of rock music goes. The point is to rock, dream, and hear lots of melody, all of which IQ delivers on."
2,Missed the mark for me,"I found the book to be interesting, as an account of another person's relationship, but the relationship did not convince me as being Asperger's. The author admitted she only guessed her former partner had Asperger's. My relationship is completely different in many ways, so I could not relate to her very much. Perhaps there is wide variance in Asperger's; perhaps he was not an Aspie at all.If you are interested in reading about other people's relationships, this is interesting and might as well be fiction. If you want to really connect and learn about Asperger's syndrome I DO NOT reccomend this book."
4,vinnies tampon case,"Although I do like this case, I think its a little hard to get the tampons out of the pockets. Very colorful..love that it has a zipper to hold everything in. No more having to pull out a pen from my pocket book and instead pulling out a tampoon."
5,have a happy period,"this is the coolest case ever! the wording inside and on the tag are awesome, great gift."
4,I Wuz There & Paid for It!!!,"Here's a little bit of info on this 'Live' CD (never pressed it on vinyl):Recorded for $300 on a mobile ADAT unitMixed and Mastered for $165 @ Zero Crossing Studios in HollywoodConcept discussed over many drinks at the Bomp Records 25th Anniversary show @ the Garage in Silverlake, CA ~1999 (likened it to the 1st KISS ""Alive"" record, recorded after 3 studio records)Recorded 5 days after the Dragons did their usual ""Exile on Kettner Ave"" gig on X-mas Eve @ the Casbah in San Diego, where this was recorded. Little did I know that Mario's voice would still be trashed 5 days later, much to my disappointment after to listening to the rough cutsBut...there is nothing like seeing them @ the Casbah in front of their hometown crowd. And it was packed on a Weds nite. And I was drunk as usual, right in front of the stage, stealing Mario's Jack n Cokes!"
4,UNA CERVEZA,ANY GROUP COVERING THE TEXAS TORNADOES OR THE FOUR HORSEMEN HAS-AT LEAST-GREAT TASTE.ROCK ON.
4,"""For once, Dredd may be out of his depth.""","This is one of the better Dredd novels. The writing is very clean, concise, and free of confusing jargon and technobabble for the most part, and the author maintains a consistent tone throughout the novel.The author uses Armitage, one of the novels main characters, as a solid foil for Dredd, allowing the author to reveal more about Dredd and to touch upon areas the previous novel hadn't explored. With this novel, Judge Dredd evolves into something closer to a real human being than he'd been in The Savage Amusement.In a nutshell, if you enjoyed The Savage Amusement, you'll probably really like Deathmasques. If you haven't read the previous novel, then I suggest you think very carefully about what your limit for gratuitous violence is before reading Deathmasques, because this novel is one long blood-bath."
5,Tupelo honey,"Tupelo honey is the best cut on this album! It is absolutely one of the best songs he ever recorded, right up there with Astral Weeks and Madame George! It blows me away, you will love it! Paula"
4,It's a keeper,"I have all of Van's early stuff. This would probably be number three on my list. Astral Weeks being first and moondance coming in a close second. The FM stations beat to death the title track so I will comment on the others. Moonshine Whiskey is one tune that really flies. It is as close to the other two albums as you can get. The rest of the album is very good, a lot of people rave about ""you're my Woman but I don't feel what they feel on that one. I'll take Ballarnia any day! So, lastly, I would say get this if you already own and like the other two."
2,Skipped,"The Cd skipped, but I'm glad it did not skip on my favorite song! I would have gave it a better rating if it wouldn't have skipped at all."
5,Sweet As ...,"If I'm in a creative mood, I put this album on. If I'm feeling a little down, I put this album on. If I'm going on a long road trip and I need something to carry me through a lull, I put this album on. In fact, I can not think of a time when putting this album on would be inappropriate. Maybe at a rave or something.This is, in my opinion, Van's finest solo effort. Each of the songs on this album tells a different story. From the John Mellencamp covered, ""Wild Night,"" to the title track ""Tupelo Honey,"" the album strikes different moods with resounding accuracy. I know of at least 10 people that consider ""Tupelo Honey"" the most romantic song that they've ever heard.These songs stir emotion and they convey possibility and that says something very powerful. This music means something to the people that listen to it. In the end, that's what music is supposed to do, I guess."
3,weak sauce,"Van has many good songs and albums, and this is not one of them, even though many people really like it. The opening track ""wild night"" is outstanding, and I like the second song, but from there on it gets really weak and petty. ""tupelo honey"" is pure schmaltz (no, thats Not a compliment) and gets very boring and tedious. The other songs are just annoying, because they lack the power that Van Morrison songs usually have. I would recommend that you get Moondance, which is a wonderful cd and his best overall work, and his Best Of vol 1 cd instead of this. There isn't anything particularly memorable about Tupelo Honey, and I have a hard time saying that because I really enjoy a lot of Van Morrison music."
2,2 0r 3 song album,Tupelo honey is a great song and you must have the album for that song. Maybe Van will decide to put it on another greatest hits album.
5,At the Very Top of His Game,"Interesting to read several reviews downgrading this collection because it's not quite up to ""Moondance"" standards. How many albums are? This is Van at the top of his game, without a bad cut on the record. Wild Nights still rocks after years of radio overplay and TUpelo Honey will make a grown man cry. Morrison's voice is as emotive and soulful as any in the business and this is as good as it gets. (I wore my vinyl copy out as a sophomore in college.)"
5,One of the best rock albums of the early seventies,"The title says it all with my opinion of Tupelo Honey. Definitely my favorite Van album. It is probably nostaglic for me, because when I was a kid my dad would sing it to me on road trips in his tone death best. The album kills. 'Nuff said."
4,One more great CD from Van in the 70's,"This is the closest Morrison came to country and the San Fransisco sound of the 70's. He's as good as ever. Although not his best cd, it shows how good he was in the 70's and that 90% of his cd's are better than any other thing in the market."
4,Van can write,"While not as awe inspiring as the majestic Astral Weeks or as forceful as Moondance, this Album shows that Van Morrison, even, not at his best, is a great song writer. Various styles are shown on this work. Wild Night as the first track shows show off that he can still write a rock and roll dance classic like the older Them song ""Gloria.""Quieter songs reaching to ballads and folk songs vary the textures throughout the record. While some of the songs are quieter, there is a spiritualness that emanates from each song.This record and His Band and Street Choir show that Van is ""The Man."""
4,Tupelo Shows Van's Extraordinary Range and Styles,"Purchased on a friend's recommendation, I was somewhat skeptical on how this album can be different from other Van Morrison albums, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. Not only am I shocked that the song Tupelo Honey has not found its way onto any ""greatest hits"" compilation albums, it perhaps ranks up there with ""Into the Mystic"" in terms of a classic soul and song. This album has a country flavor to it, but not overbearing. Songs such as When That Evening Sun Goes Down and I Wanna Roo You have the country bent to it. You're My Woman is a great love song that ranks up there with Crazy Love off of ""Moondance."""
2,"Somewhat useful, but lacks audio","The system is a pretty good one. There are lots of pictures, pages to help you practice saying and writing the words, etc. The idea of doing just a little bit each day is a good one. Unfortunately, there is no audio tape. Audio is always so important for pronounciation, but this is even more true with Chinese where tones are critical to the word's meaning. I would not recommend this book for that reason."
4,book,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read"
3,No Chinese Characters,"This book explains things well, and I like that it comes with stickers to use around the house to label things in Chinese. The reason I gave it 3 stars is it does not have any Chinese characters during the main lessons, only pinyin, except for an infrequent focus on one character. Learning written Mandarin can be intimidating to a beginning learner, but even if you rely mainly on pinyin, I think it still helps to see the characters and get used to them being there."
3,Iceberg,"This is a good introductory book to Mandarin, but by itself it is incomplete. Correct pronunciation of basic sounds is critical to a non-native speaker before jumping too far into the language. Still, I'm a visual hands-on learner and I appreciate the visual association of words with objects as opposed to systems that employ only spoken lessons. What works best for me is a combination of the two. Consequently, an accompanying tape or CD would enhance this book greatly."
3,Pretty used,Good book for learning but was pretty used.Not good since some of the lesson require towrite answers out. You can not do that when they arealready there. No problem with shipping though.
3,"Excellent scholarship, poor writing","Kaegi's book is a landmark study of one of the most important events in the history of the Byzantine Empire. His use of both Arab and Byzantine sources and his insistence on military factors are crucial for treating this subject properly.However, this book is almost unreadable. In several instances Kaegi repeats himself within a chapter, covering the same subject that he has already discussed as if one were reading a draft in progress. He also uses many infelicitious if not nonsensical phrases such as ""victorious defeat"" (p. 259). His brief, choppy sentences are frequently banal."
2,Pretty...until you get up close,"If you are looking for something to sit on your bar as display, this may be the right item for you. It's really pretty at first glance, but once you pick it up you will notice that it is extremely light and almost plastic feeling and sounding. I bought this as a gift for Christmas and didn't end up giving it because of how cheap it felt."
2,Decanter,This Decanter wasn't the quality I thought it would be.. Just a little too light. I would hold out for a better quality one. I was afraid when used it would break. But you get what you paid for and it was pretty cheap.
3,decent purchase,"A lot better than the first one i bought. Still a pain to pour the last glass of wine, I'm not sure that all decanters are supposed to be versatile."
1,Where is it?,"Ordered this item on Dec 31st and it still hasn't shipped? No word, no update? I didn't realize there was a run on wine decanters. I should have bought it at the mall."
3,The Ending Cost It At Least One Star,"I would have given ""Sister"" four or even five stars if not for the final chapters. What started out as an interesting character study of an endearing, believeable teenager struggling for survival and respect turned into a bad movie of the week with gaping holes in the plot. I won't spoil the ending for anyone planning to read this book, but how incompetent are we to believe the law officials in this town are? For heaven's sake, the neighbors' dog even - well, if I say any more, I'll give it away. I did think the title character was one of the most lovably realistic fictional teens I've ever come across, and I was rooting for her the whole way through. I just wish the author hadn't spoiled things for her with such a ridiculous plot twist."
2,Not exactly original Southern fiction,"As with other novels by this author, you feel that she is recycling old plots and characters by Faulkner, Eudora Welty, and others. She has a feel for the landscape but while there is some good writing here and there, the plot is thin."
4,"A ""dance"" compilation","At first I didn't understand this compilation. Why was ""The Secret Life of Arabia"" included, since it was never performed live, let alone released as a single? Why no ""Warsawa"" and no ""Station to Station""? Why were ""1984"" and ""Knock on Wood"" included, if they overlap with the period in the previous compilation? The answer is: this is a ""dance"" compilation. Whoever selected the tracks wanted to show the world that David had been recording ""dance"" songs long before the ""Let's Dance"" album, released in 1983. Even the ballads (""Can You Hear Me"" and ""Wild is The Wind"") are the sort of stuff one would find on David's ""dance"" albums of the 80's. So the compilation flows smoothly. The only reason why I don't give it five stars is that I don't think this is the best period of David's career. But if there were a separate rank for ""track selection"", for the period in question I'd give it five stars for sure!"
5,Certainly the place to start-- the very best survey,"I read this in its original 1967 edition when I was very young, and it inspired a life-long love of horror films (at that time the Science Fiction content was not in the title, though it was found in the book). Clarens' effort is clear and concise-- not too much on any one thing, but he manages to hit all the necessarys and high spots. It's really indispensible for the fan who's starting out in a serious study of the subject-- or who just loves horror."
5,Touched by an angel,"Comprehensive, direct, resourceful.Two thumbs up for anyone looking to start or grow their business."
4,Not Bad and Helped for '91 740,"I bought this for my 1991 740 Sedan because the book for that model was worthless. I found that the information in this book was helpful for the most part for my model. Not always the case but it got me through many repairs. The book covering my model is worthless, focusing more on newer, more hi-tech cars. If you have an early 90's 740, this might be a good addition but it's not perfect."
3,The weakest pilllar in Fitzkee's trilogy,"This book is the weakest one in the very strong author's trilogy including the Trick Brain and Magic by Misdirectioin. It also is the only one, that age has marked.It should be completed with Henning Nelms' Magic and Showmanship, Maskelyne and Devant's Our Magic and Darwin Ortiz's Strong Magic.The Fitzkee trilogy remains the work of a visionary who, ahead of our time, analyzed the essence of what magic is about. It can be supassed in some specific aspect but not as a whole work."
3,Meh,"Semi-ok assembly of songs by The Cramps.""It's a Rental"" at best. In my opinion Real music lovers don't buy greatest hits at all. Most bands worth their salt still release lps and 45s so if you like ""A Hit"" buy a 45. One exception is ""Bad music for bad people"" which is a colection of singles by the cramps and if you are looking at this, Buy that."
1,Outlaw all post-release editing.,"This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned!"
5,Douglas Fairbank's best work,"Directed by Raoul Walsh in 1924, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is definitely the OG Arabian Nights fantasy in Silent Film. A 1940 Technicolored version was released starring Sabu but the two versions are complete opposites. The biggest difference is that the 1924 version starring Swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks does not have a Genie popping out of a bottle to grant 3 wishes.With lavish production sets and great trick photography, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD is both visually stunning and far ahead of its time. Reported to be on of the first Million Dollar productions of the time, you can see that the money was spent on the sets. Douglas Fairbanks gives the performance of a lifetime in this classic tale set in ""The Dream City of the East."""
4,Historical point of interest...,"I remember seeing this silent movie on television back around 1985. Somehow, I remember better picture quality and a different musical score based on music by Rimsky-Korsakov. While I thought it was very interesting as a historical point of interest, I didn't find myself as enjoying the movie as much as I remembered when I saw it on TV years ago.Even so, the sets, costumes and special effects, are quite amazing. At times, the director does create a feel for the exotic. Douglas Fairbanks is also quite talented in his top form and agility. Undoubtedly, the best aspect of the movie is the lovely and all-too-brief appearences of Anna May Wong, even though her character is a shameless Asian stereotype.If you are a person who doesn't mind experiementing with something a little bit different, you might just enjoy this movie. At any rate, you haven't much to lose considering the bargain-basement price."
3,It's Cut?,"Some one here says this DVD has a cut down version of the film. I was going to say, if you have never seen it, it's one of the Classics of the Silent era and Fairbanks. One thing I might add that will completly change the way you percieve this film... Think Gene Kelly. Don't think about Fairbanks as an Actor, think about him as a Dancer and suddenly this film becomes a whole other kind of experiance. I'd hate to see any footage missing from this Master Work of one of the Silent Eras greatest stars. If this version is indeed cut down, go look for the complete version, and one that isn't running at Sound Speed too."
4,Thief of Bagdad,Have not seen it yet -- sorry --- but it did make Fairbanks the ultimate sex-symbol swashbuckler -- so I am assuming it will please me
1,Wrong one!,I had hoped to surprise my sister with a movie of the 'Blue Rosé' for Christmas...one where we had watched together as children in the 60's. Two days after Christmas she called to tell me it was an earlier version that had no talking! I paid for the deluxe version and it was the wrong one...now I have a movie I will never watch.. Just be careful you read everything because I obviously didn't..
1,Too old,"My husband, who is a Movie Buff, thought this was just too old a version. We are returning it."
2,"Cheap, Irritating","I purchased this DVD set on impulse the other evening. It was on the clearance shelf and I thought ""why not"". Was I surprised when I started watching it and noticed that none of the episodes had the original theme song opening, just guitar strumming. It gets irritating after awhile. Its also unclear if the episodes are even supposed to be chronologically. In short, skip it. I see there are more authorized offerings of this show out there. There should be some sort of disclaimer on the box."
3,Cheap guitar strumming?,"That is a splendid version of The Sweet Sunny South! I know it ain't the theme song you are looking for ---I, too purchased the same thing. But---don't damn the song! It is an old-time American bluegrass classic--and well played, in this case! Consider it a treat!"
2,Not bad dvd but disc 2 is defective; all other discs play fine,I notified the seller by email but got no response. I enjoyed the show and was looking forward to sharing these dvd discs with my kids. I was disappointed when disc 2 was not playable.
3,Well...,"Picture quality: The picture quality wasn't so good. It had crackles, and was sometimes blurry.Audio: So-so, kind of muffly.Amount of Episodes: The DVD has 30 episodes which is a lot. Goofs: In episode ""Jed Gets the Misery"", when Mr. Drysdale comes over and is talking to Elly May, right before he sits down on the bench, you see the boom mic shadow appear to the left of the front door. Later when Granny, Miss Hathaway, & Elly May are outside, turn the sound up and listen closely. Right before Granny says, ""Now Elly May"", you hear a high-pitched quick beep. In ""Jed's Dilemma"", after Jed puts gas in the truck and walks over to Pearl, you also see the boom mic shadow. You might have to watch it on your computer to see the mic shadow better."
1,Smashing Shredder for Stamps,"This is one of the worse stamp dispensers I/we have ever run across! We purchased (luckily only 2) to try for our agency (35 to 50 people) and they are horrible. I would not recommend anyone purchase this type...stay away! They smash even a 50 count roll of stamps down into an oval shape then you have to pull really hard to get it to roll/move to get your stamps out. Sometimes the stamps peel off inside and get stuck to the others & good luck getting the stamps apart in 1 piece, we couldn't. We threw ours in the trash. Staples does not carry them anymore, maybe Office Max or Office Depot? USPS has some expensive ones or a white (not see thru) plastic dispenser that is reasonably cheap."
3,not a 'classic' when first listening is 2012,"A few songs were real good but I was expecting this to be life altering. But, I bet I'd feel different if I'd had heard it when it was new."
2,It's slow and heavy,"The self title debut from Black Sabbath was an important release for its contribution to heavy metal as a music genre. The material is overall slow and heavy with Osbourne's voice cutting right through everything in its way But the songs are not that great, with the exception of the title track ""Black sabbath"", ""The wizard"" and ""N.I.B"". The rest is nothing to be excited about. I can't see why this release is so highly praised."
1,"I'm a Sabbath fan, but this quite the crappy album","I've been a fan for a while now, starting with Ozzy's solo stuff then moving on to Sabbath. I just bought this album. I love Black Sabbath's raw sound which isn't over produced, but this album is just plain nasty! Ozzy sounds like he'd just smoked two packs of cigarettes before laying down the vocals in the studio. In terms of historical importance (musically speaking) that title is more appropiate for Paranoid. I'm sure there are some purists up in arms over is---but if it sounds like [...] than it probably is. Skip is album and purchases the following:1. 'Sold our soul for rock 'n' roll' If you like what you hear...2. purchase 'Symptom of the Universe'3. and then Black Sabbath Vol.4 to round it all off.If your new to Sabbath, don't start out with this album. And even if your not........still don't purchase it."
1,REAL METAL DIDN'T START HERE,"what is this? real metal didn't start here, real metal was born in 1995 when the first korn album was released. this is old hippie music, this isn't heavy metal. korn is the real godfather of metal."
4,70's Goth,"Black Sabbath (Self-titled debut): Taking into account that Ozzy was, and is, thoroughly insane, the band did manage to make some spectacular albums (even if they were spectacularly creepy). This, their first, is one of their best. I like the album, I don't love it."
4,Sabbath's first album,"Their debut album made a name for themselves leading into Paranoid and Master of Reality, which I think are the best two albums they ever had."
5,Sabbath fan,"Heavy, classic Sabbath. The roots of the great band start here. Who doesn't know ""Black Sabbath"" or ""N.I.B.""? Nearly everyone who listens to or plays rock 'n roll music is inspired by this band, and this album is their beginning...just look at what followed!"
5,DELUXE VERSION OF WHERE METAL STARTED!,"If you are a Sabbath fan, you will definitely want to pick up this version which I feel is the definitive version! This has the song that started the demonic side of heavy metal with the song BLACK SABBATH. The album is of course amazing and if you are just getting into the classic era of Black Sabbath, this is essential. The sound quality is perfect for disc 1 which also includes Evil Woman which for years was unavailable in the USA. Disc 2 is what collectors will really want this for. This has outtakes of Black Sabbath, The Wizard and Behind The Wall of Sleep. This also has an alternative version of Evil Woman which is quite interesting but it is quickly obvious why the original version was picked. The packaging is great compared to the US version or the mid 90's castle remastered edition. This has detailed liner notes and pictures from the original LP version. If you still need convincing, it is Black F***ING Sabbath! Pick it up, you will not be let down!"
5,A-1 Stuff,"This is an all-time great.Sabbath defines ""heavy"" with this one, as the bass carries most of the album. There isn't one stale tune on it, unlike some of their other ones. While not as popular (you'll never hear any of this stuff on a classic rock station), I really feel it's the best of their first 4 albums, although most people who reviewed the Sabbath albums here seem to favor ""Master of Reality."" I think this one rocks more than ""MoR"" because it features more free-lance guitar, and is not as commercialized as much as ""Paranoid"" (which hurts me to say, because that's the only album to get a lot of airplay)."
4,"great disc, for what it isc","This album truly defines the foetal stages of what is now defined as ""heavy metal"", although it's only rock and roll. ""Spinal Tap"" is truly a graphic novel, if you will, of the Sab. Comic, yes, but also essential for any true music connieseur or eclecticist. Admit it, ""The Wizard"" is an essential piece of rock history."
5,"The best ""out there"" heavy rock album of its era","Black Sabbath has always been a great influence to the community at large now in the rock music world, and even though now it isn't used quite too properly by many bands, their first album is still, to me, the most rewarding despite so many other immitations and re-toolings. While the title song itself isn't one of the band's best songs, all the others are way up on the list, inparticular The Wizard, NIB and Wicked World. For those wanting a repeat listen, or for younger people wanting to dabble in the dark rock region, with a heavy blues mix, disappointment is not in sight in this LP's presence."
5,FATHER OF THEM ALL !!!,"This album is much better than PARANOID, for example. This is a punch in the stomach, the definitive beginning of ""heavy metal"", the first clear use of power chords and riffs together. Ozzy is singing like never, the production is good for seventies' standards. I imagine hearing it when it was originally released, what a shock it must have been. All the tunes are great, Iommi solos are some of the best of his entire career, the lyrics are perfect. What more do you want?"
3,Premier album de Black Sabbath,"Qui ne connait pas Black Sabbath?? Qui ne connait pas Ozzy Osbourne ?? Peut-tre qu'un inculte le ferait, mais la renommée de ce groupe n'est pas que rumeur. Black Sabbath est leur premier album, et mme si ce n'est pas cet album qui a leurs plus grands classiques, il est un album formidable! En tout, 5 pistes forment l'album, mais deux d'entres elles sont des medleys incroyables! J'ai un petit penchant pour la chanson ''the wizard'' avec l'harmonica de Ozzy (cré Ozzy!), mais toutes les chansons valent la peine!Je vous le recommande grandement si vous aimez la music quand mme lourde et de la bonne guitare!"
3,good debut album,"Some nice jamming on this album, great guitar playing. The songs are decent enough...i would say this is better than vol4 but not as good as sabbath bloody sabbath. There ya go. Thanks"
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,This is definatly 1 you can fall asleep to. Its so slow and sluggish it hurts to hear it.
4,Heavy metal started here,"In 1967-68,Black Sabbath came up with a very brutal,unforgiving, sound in rock music which some people called acid rock but otherwise known as heavy metal.This 1970 debut album has the same trademark sounds that metal still has today.Ozzy Osbourne's high pitched tenor voice.Tony Iommi's evil doom and gloom guitar riffs.Geezer Butler's evil bass rumble and Bill Ward's heavy drumming.This album isn't perfect,but it didn't need to be.After all,metal's sound was in its birth on this album.Black Sabbath would soar to popularity from here on and helped to pave the way for other metal bands.Nearly every metal band can trace their sound to Black Sabbath to some degree.This album would help Ozzy Osbourne gain the title of ""godfather of heavy metal"" and defines the roots of metal.Has a very generic album cover compared to what you have today.Heavy metal has had to endure a lot of trends over the years,but if you're new to the genre,this is a good place to start."
5,The roots of metal,"Together with Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple in Rock, this album is the quintessence of hard rock. Being of one the three founding fathers of heavy music, Black Sabbath's self-titled debut failed to achieve the same success as its followers ""Paranoid"", ""Master of reality"" and ""Sabbath bloody sabbath"".. However one thing that is that it made history. The dark and ominous melody sets the tone for the whole album from the thunder sounds of the opening track all the way to the ""Sleepy Village/Warning""...It's here that the band developed their signature sound with Iommi's heavy riffs, Geezer's strong bass accords and Ozzy's sarcastic voice. What a way to start off the great journey into Black Sabbath history"
1,KORN,"These hippie scum bag don't even know how to name a song! N.I.B? What the hell is that supposed to be? These losers may have a few fans, but if you want real Metal you have to check out Korn and Limp Bizkit. Those are the God Fathers of Metal. Fred Durst is the greatest lyricist in the history of thye world. Other great Metal bands like Blink-182, LIT, and Jimmy Eat World are just posing Limp and Korn but its alright: you can't beat perfection!"
4,First-but not Sabbaths Best.,"My father bought this CD and listens to it all the time in his truck. Now I have heard Black Sabbaths other stuff but never the early stuff. Though it has good music it is not anywhere as good as ""Paranoid"" or ""Mob Rules"". Actually I would reccomend Ozzy's solo work over any Black Sabbath album. But anyways, back tho the First LP. It is low budget, and a bit darker than later Sabbath, but things change. The guitar work by Toni Iomi is great and he does some really great solos, but his riffs are nowhere as powerful as they are in ""Iron Man"" or ""Paranoid"". Basically, this album is just like most metal bands first, such as ""Kill Em All"" by Metallica and ""Cowboys from Hell"" by Pantera- its good a good start, but it gets better."
5,A GREAT DEBUT FOR THE GREATEST BAND EVER,THIS ALBUM IS SO AMAZING IT ABSOLUTELY BLEW ME AWAY! FROM THE OPENING CHURCH BELL TO THE CLOSING GUITAR RIFFS IT JUST DOESN'T STOP. CLEARLY SABBATH'S GREATEST EFFORT ASIDE FROM PARANOID!
4,Sabbath + Deep Purple = Metal,"After 30+ years this debut from the Birmingham quartet still sounds fresh and chilling. And this, my friends, is how heavy metal was cast upon the world.ALong with Deep Purple in Rock, Machine Head, some of Zeppelin's works, Black Sabbath started what would soon become a mainstream."
5,Changed Everything,"I was 11 years old when this came out. The spooky cover, the sound of evil coming out of the speakers. LOVED IT!!! If you think Ozzy is famous because of his tv show you have a lot to learn childrens. This record, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol. 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, are all part of the education. Get them all now."
4,Black Sabbath/Black Sabbath-Birth of Modern Metal,"Although the group did not have the benefit of the experience of having recorded a previous album, it displays the powerful stirrings of an awakening metal Titan. The guitar riffs are very close in quality/inspiration to the soaring archetypal metal motifs that were to be born on the groups followup ""Paranoid"" album. Toni Iommi's guitar licks were shockingly different from other guitarists of the day. Ozzy's voice was huge in it's panoramic sonic range and his ability to inject beautiful melody into this growling aural ""barrage band"".All in all, this album is a must for the serious Sabbath fan who wishes to have complete understanding of the evolution of this elemental superhuman metal juggernaut."
5,THE SH*****T.,"ALOT OF PEOPLE THINK PARANOID AND MASTERS ARE THE SH*** BUT REALLY THIS FIRST SABBATH ALBUM AIN'T BAD AT ALL...IT'S GOT THE WIZARD WHICH IS A SONG THAT ROCKS OUT FOR YOUNG DRUMMERS AND GUITARISTS EVERYWHERE TO JAM ON TO TIGHTEN THEIR EARLY CHOPS WITH...IN 84, THE 19 YEAR OLD ME WOULD PLAY IT ALOT..ON BOTH INSTRUMENTS...THE FRIGHTENING COVER AND THE SPOOKY OPENING SONG HAS TO GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES IF YOU BELIEVE IN JESUS AS I DO ! THIS IS SATAN , PEOPLE...! PACKAGED AND PUT ON A DISC TO SCARE THE LIVING SH** OUTTA YOU...IT'S GOT NIB (SOME OF MY FRIENDS USED TO SAY THAT STOOD FOR NUNS IN BONDAGE)...BUT I DON'T THINK IT DID...ANYWAY, THIS IS A GREAT SABBATH ALBUM...I WOULD SAY IT IS THE BEST BUT PARANOID AND THE DIO LED 'HEAVEN AND HELL' ARE RIGHT THERE WITH IT...THIS IS A CLASSIC THOUGH...FIVE STARS; BUY THIS NOW !!!!"
3,"Considered a classic, but it's NOT !","I'm being honest: BLACK SABBATH, JUDAS PRIEST and DEEP PURPLE (in this order) are the real fathers of all the metal scenario whe have today and since the mid-70's. It's not LED. But this debut by Sabbath is clearly overrated by fans. The technical possibilities of that time did'nt permit a good producing job, and the resulta is that the songs doesn't envolve you nowadays. It's totally out of time, contraty to other SABBATH albuns like ""VOLUME FOUR"" and ""SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH"". IT has, of course, a historic valor as the debut of the great Birmingham band, who showed the world one of the greatest rock stars of all times. Mr. Ozzy."
3,Nativity In Black,"I myself am a Black Sabbath fan. I find music I like and listen to it over and over... some I come to like. This album is the beginning. I call it ""the intro"". This album preceded 3 of the greatest albums ever created. Its interesting and cool to see how the greats began.If you are interested as far as a fan is concerned. Buy this album. N.I.B. is a great song... but, if you are in it for ""Iron Man""... you may be disappointed.If you really believe Korn and Limp Bizkit qualify as a couple of the greats... please go away, you don't deserve to touch a Black Sabbath album. Show a little respect for the people who got where they are without releasing pop music with a grundge pedal.Enjoy all who will. I thought it was decent enough to add to the collection."
4,Awesome Debut,"1970. Black Sabbath's debut CD and they come out rockin'. I don't like Ozzy but I do like the Sabbath stuff. And this CD is classic Black Sabbath. The first track, which is the title track, excellent way to open the album with the rain and the bell tolling at the beginning. This sets the mood for the rest of the album. And of course two other classics N.I.B. and The Wizard."
5,Awesome Debut from the Metal-Masters,"This album is truly impressive. There are a few things about it that count against it though. First of all, the version of ""Black Sabbath"" on this album isn't all that great. The best version of this song is on Ozzy's greatest hits album entitled ""The Ozzman Cometh"" (It sould be noted that the sound quality of this particular track is not that great but the performance of ""Black Sabbath"" is excelent, much better than on the original studio recording). The only other weakness the album has is the song ""Warning"". It's not a terrible song by any means but it's not as great as the other songs on the album, it is a bit too long and it can get boring at times. My favorite part of this album is the guitar solo on ""Wicked World"". Overall, a 5 Star Album."
2,Interesting,If you like RV's and women's issues then this is the item for you. Otherwise you will have to search for the laughs.
3,one man' s treasure,"Several years ago, Burton traded in the wayward garage-rock of Nebraska for the even-more-wayward twangtopia that is Austin. Like most artists, the fact that he'll never be a major unit-shifter has nothing to do with his talent. Although the steel guitar and shuffle beats suit Burton's wordsmithing better than the crash and burn stylings of his former band, I couldn't help but pine for a blast of Phil Shoemaker somewhere in the middle of this record. Nevertheless, few musicians can make you laugh out loud upon your first listening like Burton. I thought about stealing this from my local library but think I'll actually purchase my very own copy. Three stars when compared to the rest of my record collection, five stars when compared to Ashley Brittney Courtney Rickey Judd Spears Love Martin."
2,Not as pictured,"Careful - the picture and description are misleading. All this seller seems to be selling is the interior plastic dividers, not the box itself, despite what is pictured and described. I ordered two, and when I asked where the rest of the order was, I received no reply. It was a Christmas gift, and I didn't have time to pursue the matter before Christmas, so I let it go, but I was left with a slightly cheated feeling."
5,Gorgeous product and very fast delivery,"I would give this product and company 10 stars if I could!I ordered 2 of these bento boxes and they arrived within 3 days of placing the order. They were wrapped in plastic, bubble wrap, and peanuts so they were in perfect condition upon arrival. And they are lovely :)"
5,Genius,"I don't even know if anyone really needs to review this on Amazon. It's a classic, it's mind blowing, and it's wonderful. Dostoyevsky wrote it, what else do you want?"
3,"Slow, but Good Values","Much like the title suggests, story was incredibly slow, had hard time getting through it. The redemptive quality by the end though hits so hard it is almost worth the painstaking hours put in to get to that point."
3,A psychological journey,"I first read this novel at university in the mid 60's and decided to re-visit it after travelling to St. Petersburg. I read somewhere that reading Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment faithfully re-creates Russian society of his era in the city from his own experiences. While this is no doubt true I found that the greatest appeal for me was the way the reader is taken on a psychological journey inside the mind of the main protagonist. Starting from the shock of the brutal murders he commits we are led through his vacillating self-justification, guilt, seeking love and redemption to the final resolution. I had forgotten how the novel ended exactly and so was kept interested to see how it would all turn out for Raskolnikov. At times a touch pedestrian Dostoyevsky's writing nonetheless kept me interested during this psychological journey. A classic read of one of Russian literature's great novels."
2,unreadble,The whole story was jumbled without a story byline. Could not finish the book after reading approx half of the text.
2,Surprisingly boring and vapid,"I expected this book to be an incredible read, a mind-altering study of guilt and conscience and other philosophical issues. Boy was I wrong. This book was just plain boring. At no point was it gripping, at no point did it force me to think, at no point did it introduce any ideas that contained even a hint of originality. The content was no more intelligent and thought-provoking than an episode of ""Friends."" And the actual structure of the writing read like a second-grader's short story for English class. Maybe it was just the translation, but it was horrible. How many times did I see the combination of letters: ""Aach""? That's not a word in English. Nor is it even a common expression. Nor is it the phoenetical spelling of a noise that I've ever heard. Couldn't the translator have come up with a better translation? A very disappointing book..."
4,Crime and Punishment,I read this book in one sitting and thought I'd brag about it to a wide-scale audience. I recommend this book.
5,Constance Garnett!,"After reading a number of the new and celebrated Russian translators, I came back to this old version of Crime and Punishment and realized what I had been missing. The newer translators may be technically more accurate. And from time to time the may seem more colloquial. But they never capture the verve and the passion that epitomizes the great Russians. This novel especially flourishes under the hand of Garnett, who got not just the language and the culture but the essential frenzy of Dostoyevsky."
2,What translation is this? AVOID until that info is provided,"The price is pretty steep for a book you can dl for free -- even from Amazon for free. And there is no info as to which translation this is. C'mon Amazon! Information, please. Avoid."
5,Hilarious,"I'm a big Dostoyevski fan, but Crime and Punishment has a special place in my heart: when I was a student (and flat broke), a friend and I took turns reading the book aloud. We laughed our asses off, especially during the scene in the tavern with Marmaladev. (there's also a very funny comic book edition of the book, which reads like one extended non sequitor. example quote: the police inspector tells Raskolnikov, ""I know you killed that little old woman and her daughter, but I trust you, and know you'll do the right thing."" look for this edition in your finer bookstores)"
3,Criminals are bad right?,"This was one of the thickest books I had ever read when I was just finishing high school. This book talked about how a criminal goes about committing crimes and what they think when they are planning a crime. This book was written through the eyes of a criminal mind and I think it makes the criminal the protagonist. It was too long and too much extra info that we didn't need to know just for the sake of using up words, most of the descriptions were unnecessary."
1,"Demented,Demented, Demented","Okay, Okay, anyone who has read this book knows I have to admitt it is excellently written. So that I won't even try to deny. I mean, after he killed the two ladies I felt guilty!! As well written as this book is, it is demented, and the things that he says and feels(especially the things that are true)should tourcher any sane person down to their very soul. There are people like this man in the world, of that I have no doubt, but through their pains, sufferings, and guilty consience, things will not be alright, and this is something that should not even be suggested to the weak and fickle minds of today. (Post Scriptum, sorry for any spelling mistakes, I can read well, but spelling, that's a different subject.)"
5,i love it,"There is only one book, and it is from the same author,which is better than ""Crime and punishment""-it's name is ""The brothers Caramasovi'"
5,A timeless classic.... a must buy.,The writer goes deep into the character. He describes the deepest emotions of the characters. They are very real. Very impressive. This is a very powerful and potent book.
5,I absolutely loved it,"This was one of the most entertaining stories I have ever read. I was immediately taken in by the plot and fascinated by Raskolnikov's ""experiment"". I know a lot of people don't think that long Russian novels are going to be a lot of fun, but this book was. It had an odd, dark sense of humor that I really enjoyed, and one of the most interesting debates over the morality of various life choices I've ever seen. It was really accessible to the modern reader and I think all that speaks to its timelessness."
4,Emotionally exhausting,"When a book has a visceral effect on the reader, the author must be doing something right. My father complained of actually feeling sick while reading this, and I had a similiar reaction. There is a pervasive darkness here which is little to do with Raskalnikov's crime and punishment and everything to do with the grime and general despair of St. Petersburg. You can almost breath the coal dust in the air; physical and moral squalor taint everything. Even the supposedly good characters live in a state of degredation, and poverty is everwhere. Given this, the pure moral which Dostoevsky seems to try to draw out of it seems a bit ridiculous, and is the main flaw of the book in my eyes. He tries in the last stretch to uplift, but he's shown us too much squalor to make it believable. This book is a bit of a chore to read, I found, given its length and unremitting tone, and while it's clearly the work of a master author, I don't reccomend it unconditonally."
1,Audiobook version narrated by Heald is not the Pevear translation,"Amazon says this Blackstone Audio version, available on CD and from Audible, is the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation. It is not. If you go to the Blackstone Audio site, it clearly states that the unabridged version narrated by Anthony Heald is the Constance Gardner translation from 100 years ago. The cover art on the Blackstone site even shows that Garnett is the translator but not when seen on Amazon or Audible. Very misleading."
3,It was kinda psycho,"Hi everyone.....I need help I have a book report due and I need to know pages in the book. For part 1,2,3,4,5,6...please e-mail me roxy311_98@yahoo.com Thanks"
1,I hated it!,"I felt like my crime was buying the book and my punishment was reading it. I bailed out mid-way when I could no longer ignore that the characters constantly reminded me of the ""two wild and crazy guys"" from Saturday Night Live. The idea for the book was good but, at least to me, the characters were idiotic and boring. Given the acclaim and popularity of this book, I'm sure that my opinion is in the minority, if not altogether alone."
1,Wish I lived near the Red Sea,"Although I'm sure this book is wonderfully written in many ways, I cannot help but say that I absolutely hated it. I'm certain that persons with more scholarly inclinations will completely disagree with me, but I cannot help but envy another reviewer who has tossed his copy into the Red Sea. Although I cannot pinpoint exactly where this novel and I got off on the wrong foot, I will say that there was too much repetition, and I could not identify with or even like any of the characters. By the time I got to the end, I was thinking that I wished someone had jerked the book out of my hand and slapped me with it before I ever opened it."
1,Awesome,"This book was hard to read and is for serious readers only. That being said, it was a fantastic book. It is not a light beach read and takes effort to get through. When you are done, you know you read a masterpiece. It really goes into the mind of a man who makes a terrible mistake then tries to redeem himself, or rather how he gets t to the point of being ready to. Not for the faint of heart who like light books, but if you consider yourself an educated person read this. I have since went on to read The Idiot and am about to read Brothers Karamozov, that is the best recommendation I can give."
4,A must have for any russian lit fan,"Dostoevsky is one of literature's most vivid writers and C&P is one of his best examinations on the individual conscience. Alex Jennings, a brilliant stage actor whom I had the pleasure of watching in the RSC's Hamlet, does a magnificent job of manipulating the characters and the voices. The reading is very believable and utterly entrancing. You won't be able to turn this off. I'm a 17 year old senior in high school and if I can find brilliance in this, anyone can. Enjoy. I highly recommend this audiobook."
5,Understanding the Criminal Mind,"This is the classic psychological novel of our time! Dostoevsky examines every inch of the human mind at its most horrific moment. It will take a good hour before you are fully taken in by the story. Once you are there - you anxiously await the outcome. At the end - you will probably feel more sympathy for the murderer than the murdered, because the author gave us so much insight into the criminal mind. Dostoevsky made us believe that the main character could even be you or I."
5,Realizing the Crime,"""A man with a weak mind, kills his landlady. He who is afraid of consequences, but doesn't realize his own sin until he understands the power of love......"" Dostoevsky surprisingly and amazingly describes the mind of a human discriptly. I recommend you to read this book. It's a life time experience."
3,"A Disappointment, AGAIN..",All through school and university I had effectively avoided Dostoevsky. Reading it again now has confirmed my disappointment five years ago; as much as I dislike stereotypes I am now utterly convinced that D. did suffer earlier in his life from insanity and was pitifully riddled with self-doubt. The moral dilemmas Raskalnikov faces are thrown at the reader like so much leg in a tawdry burlesque show. Introspection guidelines for Idiots.
2,over-rated,"This is a mal-shaped book structurally. Raskolnikov suggests to the lawman about mid-way through this long book that he is the killer...and then the book still has hundreds of pages to go! The second half seemed to me a lot of filler. I think THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV a masterpiece, and it is also about a murder. But CRIME AND PUNISHMENT doesn't deserved its classic status. And Nabokov detested Dostoevsky, because he didn't like the idea of characters coming to spiritual awakening through horrendous acts. And, while I think Dostoevsky was a better writer than Nabokov thought he was, that's one of the problems I had with this book: In the end you're supposed to feel uplifted by Raskolnikov's ""awakening,"" but all I could think was, ""But the guy murdered two women! He should be drowned in the river he is standing near!"""
5,I dug it the most Daddy-O,"Is it just me, or does it seem that almost everyone who gave this book a really bad review posted with horrible misspellings? I mean what the hell does psuedo intelectual mean? Tourcher instead of torture? Man, get a clue before you criticize. I think some of you people need to go back to Tom Sawyer and start over before you try to hit the heavy stuff."
3,Profound thought...difficult to read,"Crime and Punishment offers the best of Dostoevsky'spre-existential existentialism, but is mired ...(by) its length and unnecessary details. Raskolnikoff's character is portrayed in the best literary tradition, as are his arguable polar sides, Sonia and Svidrigailoff. This Wordsworth version, however, is not very well put together. There is one partition that only contains one chapter. Names are spelled differently than any version my classmates read. Choose another version if you purchase this work. Thought-provoking, but slow and plodding."
5,Crime and Punishment,"A complete Crime of murder: punishment by the consumption of the guilty man to the point of confession. Throw in a mix of emotions and shifty characters, and you have the highly regarded Dostovesky nove, ""Crime and Punishment""Intriguing, but intense. Good leader for War and Peace."
3,o.k.,still in process dont know if I will ever complete.. written in old prose and dry too boot.. redundant at times .. good luck ..I also found it had a very depressing effect
4,"A long haul, but worth it","Yes, it is a classic. Definitely a long read, demanding attention, but well worth it. Be sure to get the larger paperback (with slightly larger print) so you don't go blind! Also be sure to get the edition with the character descriptions in the front of the book--this is helpful as the characters go by first names, nicknames, last names, first and middle names--can get confusing. (Boutght two versions, not sure which version I am reviewing here, as the image associated with it does not match either of the paperbacks that I bought.)"
4,Required reading,"This is one of those books that should be read by every literate adult. Not because of the literary stature of the author, nor because of the country and culture in which it was written - simply because it is the type of book that once read is always remembered. I first read it almost twenty years ago and I still think about it from time to time."
4,Worth reading if you can be patient...,"What a wonderful, or horrible, mirror to my soul. And of course, the price of all actions."
4,Poe meets Lt. Columbo,"Surprisingly relevant, entertaining and ultimately inspiring. Reads a bit like an Edgar Allen Poe novel until the original prototype for TV's Lt. Columbo enters the story."
1,I did not order this book.,I never ordered this book. Please make sure I have not been charged for it!! Please let me know as soon as possible.
2,Crime and punishment,I am sure this book is quite good.Just found it pretty hard to get into.Hav'nt finished yet.Hope the book gets better
2,Poorly Abridged!,"The book does not even make sense due to the poor abridgement. I would not recommend this edition, though the book is a wonderful classic."
3,rather difficult,"I read this book when I was a high school sophmore, and found it to be one of the most boring books I have ever read. The book was quite difficult, and it became rather confusing at times. Perhaps, this is because I am too young to truely appreciate a novel such as this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the themes of the book, and the symbolism included.It is a book that can really make you think, and ponder the themes. Overall, it is a well-written book, and well thought out."
2,Are you depressed?,"Very depressing book. Life is extremely hard. There is no hope. To fall into the life and action of this book, which to me is the only way to enjoy a book, feels much like wading into a liquid manure pool. Very vivid images.Read at your own risk."
5,The Most Exciting Novel of All Time,Easily the most exciting novel I have ever read. What gripping drama and what unforgettable characters! I though Tolstoy was great but Dostoevsky is even better. Now on to The Brothers Karamazov. I hope it's just as good.
3,Classic work that should be read by all,"I read this book because it is a classic, and I'm very glad I read it. At first I didn't like the book that much; the story is not that captivating. But wait until the last chapter -- it will truly knock you on your bottom! The book is a translation from Russian, so I often times found the language a little dull (or perhaps it was just straightfoward). I would recommend reading the last chapter of the book at least several times. It is here that Dostoevsky drives home an important point for humanity -- Jesus died for our sins, no matter how great they are. If we accept him in our hearts and repent, then we are cleansed and made new again. This is what Raskolnikov realizes at the end of the story, and thus the ""subject of a new story"" can imply his rebirth in Christianity. Looking back on that lesson, the book is worth the read, even if you have to trudge through it at times like I did."
4,Readers will at once empathize and despise lead character.,"What's most fascinating about Crime and Punishment that I have not read in the other reviews here is that Dostoyevski has the incredible ability to make the reader feel true empathy for the main character while simultaneously experiencing disgust, pitty and at times extreme frustration. The setting is bleak beyond reality, yet the author creates a a world in which the reader can smell the the dank, desperation of alcoholics, lost souls, and those who have completely given up hope, yet accept their lot in life without taking recourse against their oppressors, except,of course, R. The late 1800s in Russia was a very harsh, lonely and fearful place to live. In light of the tragic life that Dostoyevski himself lived, this work of art all the more important. In many ways he's been in R.'s shoes."
5,Dark and Compelling,"This is a heart-wrenching novel about a man lost in his own theories. As a Napoleon, a superior to those ""ordinary fools"", he feels he has the right and motive to kill an old woman money-lender and free himself from poverty. The hideous guilt that builds up and somewhat destroys the young man's soul creats a web of intimacy and tension. This novel haunts and disturbs. How can a murder be justifiable? This one is.If you're a sensitive and easily frustrated person, I do no recommend this book to you. Dostoyevesky's depiction of this murder from the opening pages thrills the reader to a somewhat unbearable degree."
3,Ok Book,"I'd never read this before and was a little bit saddened by how boring the book was. They start are nice and quick with the crime, but the punishment is almost an afterthought. The book drags on. However, this particular version of it was fairly well formatted, which helped make how difficult it was to read slightly more bearable."
3,"Compelling in parts, but not an easy read.","This took me a long time to read. I stopped and started. There are three or four brain searing scenes where the madness of the central character comes to the fore. For these, the book is worth reading. I found the rest a bit tedious - perhaps a modern translation would increase connection with the material. Also, I didn't like any of the characters enough to care about the eventual outcome, which made it more difficult to wade through the slow bits.I feel like a philistine for saying so, but losing track of the names probably didn't help either - given names, patronymics and nicknames for everyone, so sometimes I'd get halfway through a scene before connecting some of the participants to their back stories. Perhaps that wouldn't have been so bad had I finished it quicker.In the end, everyone is flawed, no-one escapes tragedy, and we define our own punishment."
4,a classic but a long read,"Ohboy, is this a hard read or what?A magnificent tome, very very full.something to savor slowly, ideal for a bog book to dip in time and time again.it makes other writers look and feel vacuous"
5,Heartstopping and Powerful,"No novel brings the tension of the accused to a reader better than ""Crime and Punishment."" Although I prefer ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" this is a pulsing read that brings to light all the great questions of good and evil."
5,Prompt service,The book I ordered was in the exact condition as described and item was shipped to me promptly!
5,If you ever want to get into someone else's shoes without the pain,"This book really puts me on the edge as I sympathize with the main character over his misfortune, agonize with him over his actions, fearful of his punishment that seems inevitable, despairing over the repercussion it will have on his family and loved ones, all the while, hopeful that things will workout somehow and that all is not lost. It's like watching a disaster happen slowly before my eyes without the power or the will to stop it.The writing style, character and plot development are all perfect. The only thing I'd complain about would be that the book started off with an interesting moral debate over ""If you can kill one bad person but save many innocent, should you do it?"", but that was left hanging as the main character no longer concerns himself with this philosophical debate. But then again, it maybe better left to a different book as it was more of a catalyst for the plot and not meant to be a center piece."
5,A Living Nightmare,"The sensation this book may give you is that of a nightmare. True to nightmares both the reader and the protagonist eventually wake up. I guess there are many different things that people can take away from such a classic piece, not least of which is the concept of redemption. Although not religious, Raskolinov reaches the point where he can either melt down completely or come clean and pay for his sins.Still, the greatest accomplishment in my opinion was in creating a mood so successfully it almost seemed to affect my physical surroundings."
4,"I barely know why I liked this book, but I did","When I started to read Crime and Punishment about a quarter through it I decided to stop...or so I thought. As it turned out, I picked it up again. This book can be gory and even boring, and the main character is a murderer, and yet something about the depth of emotion in it kept me reading it.In most modern novels I've read the author tries too hard to show the characters emotions by spelling it out for you. And it comes across mediocre. Dostoevsky doesn't make that mistake, the raw emotion is mostly implied by physical reactions and leaves you to fill in the feeling yourself, almost like a good movie, I think that's one of the things that held my interest."
4,"Great book, would recommend","This book met all my needs for school required reading, but had a few typos and certain phrases still weren't translated into English, but no real meaning was lost."
4,A great read.,"I really enjoy the Russian Novelists. This classic will not disappoint, but it is not quite as good as ""The Brothers Karamazov."" It is a bit long, but engaging. Dostoyevsky addresses big questions, ones which will always be asked, though this postmodern age discourages self examination which dares to moralize. Dostoyevsky takes you inside the mind of his characters (which seems to be common to the Russian authors of the period), and you begin to compare your own thoughts. One does well to use such a book as an occasion for reflection on motives and values. A little self judgment can be good for us, and if you read it seriously, Crime and Punishment will help."
3,"Good book, but hard to read.","Having tried to repeadetly to read this book, I found it somewhat hard to get into at first. However, after I trudged my way into it, I found it very intriguing and facinating."
5,One of the greatest books of all times,"Crime and punishment is one of the most engrossing books i have ever read. Anyone who claims the book is ""boring"" ""to slow"" ""lacks plot"" ""sucks"" ""etc"", surely read a different book than I did. With that said...buy this book."
2,Tony the Tiger says Great!,The unsettling story of a sultry young man with unbridled passion fell into his own state of deprivation.
1,Didn't Like It,"It's probably me, since this is a classic but I just could not get through it. I even had my Kindle read it to me on my way to and from work but it was just so boring and hard to get into."
2,What translation is this? AVOID until that info is provided,"There is no information as to which translation this is. So AVOID this until that information is given. The paper version and the Kindle version appear to be different translations. I bought this ""Kindle version"" of this, but I received the usual Constance Garnett translation. I called them and got my money refunded."
5,My Favorite Novel of All Time,"I love Dostoevsky, which is something of a curse. I read Crime and Punishment 13 years ago, and have spent the following years looking for something akin to this book.Dostoevsky has the rare gift of not just writing; but truly entering the mind of his subjects; every psychological nuance. Every fear; the paranoia, guilt, hatred, persecutiion, and angst of tortured souls (Maybe it was his stay in Siberia that shaped him).Everyone should read this book. It's an open letter about the human condition. Then read The Brothers Karamozov; then The Idiot.It's not happy reading. It's literature with soul. Someday I'll find a writer this good. Until then, I'll keep rereading Dostoevsky and continue the search."
3,Crime and Punishment gets a little confusing,"This book has it's interesting parts. Then we go to these strange parts where you don't know if he is dreaming, or if he's just daydreaming? This book needs to be reinterpreted, because there was so much that I just didn't understand and the English is incorrect. I'm very glad I didn't have to do a report on this book. Glad I dodged that bullet."
2,"Warning, very long-winded!!","As an avid reader, I was told that Crime and Punishment was one of the best books written. I found it to be very long winded, though, and after suffering through it once, do not wish to read it ever again. I agree with the reader before me who said ""if you love Tolstoy you'll hate Destoevsky."" I'm am now finishing Anna Karennina and absolutely love it!"
1,Overrated,"This book was very well written, yet unbelievably dull. I didn't want to finish it because I was so bored. What is so great about this book? True, there were certain parts that were very real and interesting. Yet the book drags on and on while not keeping the reader interested. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a page-turner."
4,Very hard to get through....,"I did not read this book on Kindle, which is what this review is supposed to be about. I read a paperback since my son had it for required reading in high school. It has a very good story, that of a killer regretting his crime, IF you can get through the Russian names and get the plot! Needless to say I was quite proud of myself when I finished successfully and ""got it!"" Perhaps that I majored in history in college and took Russian history helped me through it."
1,"I'm 17, Can't do the normal review, but I have thoughts on this trash",This is so boring. This is down right trash. Don't waste your time with this garbage.
1,Search for Norton's Critical edition instead!,"I posted a one star review in hopes that it gets read.I urge you to seek out the Norton's Critical edition of this book, ISBN: 0393956237That edition has portions of Dostoevsky's notebooks, many essays in criticism, and a list of all characters so that you can keep their different name iterations in order.In other words, Norton's Critical edition is the most thorough available, and if you value this book you should seek it out."
5,Philosophical beauty,"Usually, I am skeptical about the classics. They typically bore me with a lack of plot or boring imagery. Not this book. Dostoevsky masterfully draws you into each and every character in the book, providing uncanny detail in every interaction that takes place. In reading this, before I knew it, I was immersed in a web of philosophical and psychological interchange that can excite any reader. Everything bad I heard about this book was not true at all."
5,G. Gordon Liddy? Not Raskolnikov.,"The poor boy lacked the intestinal fortitude to live with his actions. The book is typical of the excellent 19th Century Russian abilty to create interesting, larger than life characters and a good plot. To me, this book was a look at Napoleon, another 19th Century Russian obsession. Raskolnikov is the Russian Napoleon. He is not the average man, but a young demi-god who has the right to take his just desserts. However, unlike Napoleon he cannot bring the moral reality into line with the intellectual superiority. In classic Russian fashion he second guesses his actions and questions his right to take action at all (after having committed the act, naturally). The subject matter and the writing all come together to make this book what it is recognized to be - a classic"
4,Pure intellectual torture...,"""Crime and Punishment"" is a painful, but worthwhile read, as it explores the mind of the kind-hearted Raskolnikov and his psychological journey to hell amidst poverty and corruption. Somehow, Dostoyevsky's magical ability to play with words forces the reader to like Raskolnikov and to attempt to justify his evil actions. Suspenseful and exhausting, the reader will find Raskolnikov's sins and redemption to be overwhelming and awe-inspiring in this must-read-classic"
2,Not A Good Idea...,"The price is tempting, but this is a poor selection and the arrangement isn't very well thought out. I don't even see the need for a compilation, as their early albums were consistant from start to finish. If you want the Milkmen's career summed up concisely, see 'Death Rides a Pale Cow'. As for their most solid album, my pick would be 'Big Lizard'."
3,not really the best,"Death Rides a Pale Cow is definately a better way to get a wide sampling of the various styles that the Dead Milkmen used.If you can't own all of the albums they made, go with that one."
3,"Not Quite The Best, But Close","While this album is not as good as ""Beezelbubba"" it is close. And since ""Beezelbubba"" is no longer available, this one fills in well. If you are a fan of The Dead Milkmen or of any punk music, this is the album for you. For those who are not familiar with The Dead Milkmen, listen to ""Punk Rock Girl"" and you'll get the gist. Overall, good music for a good time."
2,dont bother- get DEATH RIDES A PALE COW,"there's a much better collection of ""hits"" called DEATH RIDES A PALE COW, get that one instead, it has every song here plus many more."
3,Good resource but a bit easy for those with some experience.,"This audio set is a great resource for picking up Spanish after not speaking or studying it since high school. I already have a pretty good grasp on the language and just need to be able to converse while traveling in South America. I think this set will do a good job of putting me back on track, but it's still a bit too basic for me. I've had 5 years of advanced Spanish education so I need something a bit more advanced, but for those with little experience who want to pick up some lingo, this is a great resource!"
2,Excruciatingly repetitious and boring...,"I bought these cd's for my 3 daughters(ages 11, 8 and 7)who I am trying to teach spanish. I used some great cd's to learn the basics while driving my car to work and back and we have a 15 min drive to and from school each day so I though these would be perfect. Three trips later and my children are already begging me to not make them listen to the cd's. The man's voice is especially annoying and makes my 8 yr old cover her ears and beg me to please shut it off. I am sure that if you listen to the cd's you might learn spanish, if you can keep awake. But they are definately not good for children. I remember the cd's that I had, years ago, were much more lively. I wish that I had them now."
1,Read the fine print,The problem with the entire Pimsleur system is that producers fail to be 'up front' about the total costs.Read the fine print on this program.
4,I like it.,It really does help you have a polite conversation. I love the fact that it is all audio. I can listen to it on the go.
4,Well Worth the Money,"There are already many other detailed and helpful reviews, so I'll keep mine simple. Buying this product for $25-$35 is well worth the money.No, you're not going to become fluent from $30 software. But they do a pretty good job, albeit at a slow pace. Now because of this slow pace and focus on core vocab and repetition you don't get very far (but you do get somewhere, don't worry).For this reason I would not recommend this course for someone who already has some Spanish background. This course is truly for a beginner or near beginner."
1,HORRIBLE customer support and bad product,"I bought this product hoping that I could learn spanish quickly, as advertised. It would have been easier (and cheaper, I'll get to that in a sec) and more effective to actually pay for lessons. First of all, CD's. Had they sold it as a digital download, it'd be less of a hassle to copy it down to your ipod or mp3 player, and even then skipping the parts you've already done takes forever.Secondly, they send you a second box, one which, if you dont return it, they charge you an additional $300 dollars. I cancelled mine and asked them for a shipping address, but they just extended my trial and said they'd send me an email before the extension ends so I could call again. No further email came and I was charged all that. I called them up explaining the situation and they said they couldnt help me and i'd be charged regardless. I'm selling that box on amazon to make up for the loss. All in all DO NOT BUY THIS!"
5,Great Spanish Program,"This is a very good program. I am able to listen every morning on my drive in to work, and I find myself learning quite a bit. It is a little difficult if you're a visual learner to get used to listening, but I've found that if you can concentrate on it, you really do learn well. I think it's a great product. I'll probably buy the next level after I'm completely through with this one (I'm about 80% of the way through now)."
1,Terrible customer approach,"The teaching approach is fine, but they sent me a ""free"" cd which I did not request, which would be charged to my credit card if I did not return the package within 30 days. It cost $15 to ship it back. I feel this kind of merchandising is not only immoral, but should be illegal."
5,Pimsleur spanish cd,"these are really great for those of us who did not know any spanish prior to getting the cd. I think its great.I rec. this very much. the repitition is well thought out. It is just for conversation which is why I'm taking. I really don't need conjugation, etc."
4,spanish 101,I received this product frm Amazon hoping 4 some quick lessons before my daughter & I go 2 South America. We found this method very good 4 us & I feel we won't make fools out of ourselves. I lov the people that r doing the dialogue. It has been clear & concise. We agreed w/some of the reviews that 30 minutes is a long time but now it is getting harder we need the extra time 2 get the words & pronunciation in our head. Part of the 30 mins. is used for review. I recommend it if you are an auditory learner & you can concentrate for 30 mins.
1,misleading book display,I wanted an English Spanish parallel reader. this book was displayed as such on your web site and it was very misleading since this book is not a parallel reader.
2,Only for the Novice,"I bought Pimsleur's Conversational Spanish in hopes of addressing my greatest deficiency in the language: the art of conversation. After reading so many positive reviews, I certainly thought that the product would help to that end. Sadly, though, its sixteen lessons stay on a very basic level, culminating with learning how to say ""seventy"" and ""We want to eat with you,"" words and phrases I did not need a cd to teach me.If you are starting without any Spanish background, this may be a good, practical item to buy. If not, I would recommend looking for another product."
3,"Expensive for FULL course (which this isn't), and a rip off of FSI's work in the 50s","As other reviewers have pointed out, you can get the same essential materials in the public domain (your grandparents tax dollars at work!).Check out fsi-language-coursesDOTorg or search FSI Spanish course on Archive.org ... these are programs the US govt made for workers going overseas. They use the same technique as Pimsleur does and you can get the entire 600 hour Spanish course for free."
5,Excellent purchase...,"The Pimsleur Conversational Spanish Course is an awesome buy! It does exactly what it's advertised to do, and that is to teach a person that has no previous Spanish to be speaking ""Conversational Spanish"" fast & easy. I highly recommend it!"
4,cute,"Grandson thought it was the greatest being RYAN's Pet""s. the set is cute with the doll house his sister received from Santa."
3,Great for ages 3 and up,"Amimals are very small so I would give it to a 3 or up age child. My daughter is four so it is perfect for her age. She doesn't play with the bowls since they are too small. She just plays with the animals which are very small too, but that is what she likes about them. This set is well made with wood. I bought it in addition to Plan toys barn."
1,JUNK!!!!!,"After looking all over the place for this piece of (....), I finally found it at (....). Well, I just opened it, and it's useless! I got it to switch the head out with another doll, so much for that! You only get a plastic or whatever face, and the rest is plush. I guess that's to makeit ""safe"". Don't make me laugh.This thing is stupid and useless!! DO NOT buy this JUNK!!"
3,Doll clothes not removable,"This doll is cute, and the little lamb does light up and play a lullabye as advertised. Our doll looks just like the one in the picture. Our one disappointment was that the clothes are not removable. My daughter likes to dress her dolls in different outfits and was very surprised to discover the clothes are sewn right onto the doll. I think this makes the doll a great purchase for toddlers and young preschoolers, but not as appealing for older girls."
3,poor design,"These dolls' arms and legs are fabric coated wire with the feet not very securely glued on to the legs, and not secured well to the wooden block that is the doll's body, or trunk.Our family came with a dollhouse and the mother came with part of the body broken so the leg and arm on one side swing around unnervingly when you try to pose her. The son's feet both came off after two weeks and we're not sure if we can glue them back on so they'll stay.I'm dissapointed and expect the rest of the family to deteriorate in turn. I will have to look around to find another doll family about the same size for my little girl to use in this dollhouse. ..."
3,Unable to play yet,"I know I really enjoy this game .. I've been a mech fan for years.. However, I was not able to get this up and running on my 64-bit Ubuntu ""Gutsy"" computer as of yet. The typical issue of getting the right libraries."
3,Avid Glass Fans only,"The music in this opera is superb, I have the soundtrack and listen to it often. Howerver, the sound quality is not just poor, the orchestra seems incapable of playing the music as it was meant to be (unlike the wonderfuly done soundtrack). The picture itself is also often grainy and too dark. Why then am I giving this three starts? Even poorly played, Glass's music is excellent, and the visual part of the opera is interesting. Since I am an avid Glass fan, I feel it was worth it to own a copy of this, but for others, I suggest getting the soundtrack, and then re-thinking buying this DVD."
1,Terrible quality DVD - better listen only to the CD,"I had great expectations for this DVD. I just love the opera, and wanted the visuals to make the experience greater.And what a let-down !The quality of the video is horrible (it skips from time to time, and it is not the DVD skipping), the image is sometimes blurry and sloppy, the camera takes are rather bad, never really showing the whole action on stage or specific important details.The image is also too dark.The orchestra interprets the music in a horrible way, or at least the audio in the DVD makes them sound like a junior high school children orchestra. I'm sorry, maybe a high school orchestra plays better.Being a real Philip Glass fanatic this DVD is just worth throwing away or getting your money back.Just buy any other DVD !!"
2,Breaks easily.,"I bought two of these. I gave one to my brother, and kept one on my keyring. I tend to be a bit hard on my keyring, but this thing starting having trouble after about a month. Its construction is a bit cheap."
5,Let the light shine,I bought several for Christmas give aways. Everyone appreciated the size and that it fit so nicely on their keychain. It was a great hit.
2,This didn't last,"I put this on my keychain, and it broke off after about 2-3 weeks. I repaired the link, but then the button stopped working reliably. This just isn't worth buying. Spend more money for something that will last."
1,Poor quality,The light stopped working after just a month with very little use. The ring that hold the light fob on to the key ring separates easily and the light then separates from the key ring. Poor design.
4,Heartsongs of the Universe,"HEARTSONGS OF THE UNIVERSE by Dawn Ferguson has lightened my heart and encouraged me to walk with a more energetic step. I feel as if Ms. Ferguson is singing to me. This CD is filled with healing songs, songs Ms. Ferguson created as she followed her Great Star around the world and into the hearts of her beloved dolphins, whales and sea turtles. In this spirit, I recommend her music to anyone in the process of awakening. If you are a fellow traveler, I think you'll find HEARTSONGS OF THE UNIVERSE sings to you as well, and that almost magically, the world becomes a happier, better place."
3,From Back Cover,"Rich girls do it best! At least, that's how Victoria Whitford's selling it. Sure, she's triumphantly returned home to take over the family empire, but before everything get settled, she's treating herself to one last no-holds-barred fling. And she's got the Man To Do all primed and ready - the gardener's son. She's beenhaving this fantasy since she was sixteen. Now Tori's up for the sexual challenge... She'll convince him to do as she pleases - he'll be her last best conquest...Jake Conners can't believe his eyes. Tori, sleek and sophisticated, buff and beautiful. Full of promises, full of potential. When she backs him into a corner and offers him the sexual experience of a lifetime, he can't resist. She's hot, unstoppable and better at this game than he'll ever be. He knows when he's beaten. But what's really worrying him is Tori. How long will he have before daddy's little rich girl talls him: time's up?"
3,Reasonable substitute,"I bought the battery because one of my others doesn't hold much charge. This battery doesn't last as long as the original equipment did when new, but it is much better than the one it replaced."
2,stick 2 tha Suave House albumz,This album had about 35% good songs...tha onez that r good r REALLY good but tha songs that suck are absolutely horrible. I really looked forward 2 thiz album but i wuz disappointed a lot. EVERY single suave house cd they released wuz off tha hook...i listen to each album daily but this one makez meh not wanna listen 2 it az much
1,What the %$&*...is this?,"(SMH)...ok..I did not order this one through Amazon although, they have amazing speed in getting your items to you which is great. Anyway, I picked up this cd.... I was so disappointed in this cd...it's too commercial and I feel as if they have really gotten away from their roots and love for music with this cd. It's like they just needed to put a cd out instead of having passion. It gets NO airplay in the ride! I would not even suggest it to complete the collection unless you want to waste your money. YMMV. NEOSOUL06"
5,great collection,I really enjoyed the selections on this CD. The recording quality was very good/excellent and the order of the selections added to the enjoyment as well. Especially liked the Piano Concerto No.3. A nice release by Naxos.
2,Did not reach.,"Perhaps it could be ignorance, but it was too abstract, too modern for me.Not for a learner. Lacked some information about Bartok."
3,Somethings fishy in Denmark...,"I've enjoyed W.E.B. Griffin's books over the years but I'm none too sure of this or any of his newer books in the series (after the Colonels). While it's fiction and Griffin is allowed to rewrite history but it's annoying when he rewrites his own fictional history. Case in point, long time readers know how Craig Lowell received his promotion to Lieutenant so that he could play polo just after WWII. Yet in this book we're told that he received it as a battlefield commission in Greece. It's as good a read as any of the other books he's written but it seems he wasn't paying a lot of attention to his own source material while writing it."
4,Brotherhood Series,"I purchased and have read and enjoyed the entire Brotherhood series. Griffin is awesome. His storytellling prowess and skill at bringing characters to life is second to none.I spent 21 years in the Army and I met many of his characters in my travels and work. He does a super job and I recommend his work. The editor should be chastised for some poor effort in polishing the final effort, and for that I give four stars to the whole series.The storytelling and characters therein clearly deserve five stars!"
3,Good but not what I thought it was,When I ordered it I thougt it was an unabridged but it was the abrided copy. Totally my falt the seller was clear I miss read the email. Having said that it is a perfect copy of the recording & a fun few hours.
5,Brotherhood of War Series,The Brotherhood of War series is excellent. W.E.B. has an excellent knowledge and very easy to read style. I've read the Presidential Agent series and The Corp series and they are all good.
3,I'd give it two-and-a-half stars if I could,"This series is still nothing more than an Army soap opera, but this particular book is saved from my fiercer wrath because it deals with one of my own personal areas of intrest (the Cold War as it effected sub-Saharan Africa) which is usually unreported and ignored. At least Griffin put the effort in to know the background and some of the players involved in the chaotic atmosphere that was post-colonial Africa, even if the story is as syrupy as the rest of the series."
1,Not worthy,"Sorry!I am not sure what everyone is writing about in these reviews. I read it for work and couldn't shake the sophmoric tone of this being one long and boring NPR story. Judging from the regional bias of the reviewers - most likely family members and friends of the author, I may not qualify as a mariner, but I do know when an author needs to take a couple extra expository writing classes - stay far away from this one!!!!!!!"
2,No Joshua Bell,"I have heard Corey Cerovsek in performance twice, and I have this CD. His intonation is faulty, his tone is mediocre, and his playing does not have the same spirit or passion that Joshua Bell's has. He is not in the same class as the other violinists of today-Joshua Bell, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Midori, Maxim Vengerov, Lara St.John, Hilary Hahn, ect."
5,A Tree Never Grown....,"This record was made for the hip hop world to step up and take notice of Police brutality at its worst. Amadou Diallo shot 41 times, black man, unarmed, no real reason. These rappers step up and take a stand. The known and popular rappers include Black Star, Rah Digga, Common, Pharoahe Monch, Dead Prez and Posdnous from De La Soul. They, along with other known underground rappers, address Amadou Diallo, solutions, knowledge, and facts. There's really nothing else I can say, it just must be experienced. A real hip hop fan should possess a copy. A very important record."
5,Grace We Need As Death Approaches,"Around 1985, Judson preached for me in my little church. As usual, he was a powerful expositor of scripture and a worshiper of God. But what I remember most was the gracious man who sat in our home. This book confirms that he died as he lived, with God's grace. Judson's books have mentored many young preachers, including myself.Now, I'm not so young. I was drawn to ""Dying with Grace"" and have felt the touch of eternity on my soul as I've read it.A beautiful, anointed, simply read book that I'll cherish and pass to others who are ""Embarking for Heaven."" I feel that it's even helped me prepare for my own journey whenever that will be."
3,"weak scent, thin lather that drys fast","I was expecting a thick foam that smelled strongly of pine. What I got was a thin lather that drys too fast and does not provide as much slip as my Proraso Creme http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JHEY14/ref=oh_details_o05_s01_i03Also, I was expecting a strong pine scent, this is a weak scent ... I would like it to be much stronger. I will not buy this product again."
1,Terrible,Terrible. No lather. Decent smell. A bit strong for me as I prefer no scents or scents from my aftershave. Threw it out. Everybody's got their likes and dislikes but I hated it.
2,Onr of the worst shave soaps I have tried!,This is not a very good shaving soap at all. Lucky to get one pass when you whip it up- and that pass will not be a very good lather. Overpriced body soap maybe- but not for shaving. I will have to use it with a shave cream combo- maybe that will help. But honestly- this stuff sux. Nice pine smell though!
4,Taft,"I'm a big fan of Ann Patchett, so I stuck with this book and was happy I did. It wasn't as wonderful as some of her other books, but I enjoyed it and passed it on to someone else (which I don't do if I don't like the book). Certainly not a waste of time."
3,Interesting read,"I'm not certain why Ann Patchett considers this her favorite book, but I didn't feel that it was my favorite of her books. I'm a big fan of this author, and her talent definitely shows in this book. However, it has an unfinished or loose-string kind of feel to it, that isn't intentional. It is a good read, and I will always read Patchett's novels for her excellent writing."
2,"A beautiful voice, but the story doesn't gel","I was completely mezmorized by the first quarter of the book. Even though Anne Patchett is writing as a white woman, her characterizations of John, the black male ex-drummer and bar manager, and of the other bar employees ring true. The little details in the relationships between the characters, their idiosynchrocies and habits, are intriguing. The theme of loyalty and love surrounding John's longing for his son is equally compelling. BUT - when we get to the heart of the story, where John is pulled into alove-lust relationship with Fay, my stomach had a sinking ""oh-no"" feeling. And this instant reaction was correct. This plot line was flat and unbelievable, even repellant. So, too, are issues with Carl, Fay's drug-dealing brother. Anne Patchett is an incredibly talented author. I highly enourage you to read Bel Canto or The Magician's Assistnat instead."
3,Not Nearly as Great as Her Others,"I loved the author's other books - for some reason this one didn't resonate with me at all. While I finished it, which means I didn't hate it (ha!, I would just say it was my least favorite."
4,patchett fan,"not my favorite of her's, but interesting enough to kill some winter time when it's too dark and cold to go outside."
2,disappointed,"I read Bel Canto years ago. Knowing nothing about Patchett at the time, I was enchanted with the novel in every way. Just finished State of Wonder and loved it too, so moved onto Taft. So disappointed! I only finished the book to ""see what happens."" Nothing happened! Not a believable plot or characters. What was that nice guy doing with the crazy chic? Silly. Read Run instead and see Patchett's real talent."
2,Not the best Ann Patchett,I really like Ann Patchett as a writer so I decided to read many of them. I should have skipped this one!
1,unbelievable voice,"this novel is written in the voice of a black male blues musician. who speaks completely differently than any black male blues muscians I've ever met. its like reading a bad translation of a french novel or something. First of all, musicians don't refer to blues as 'blues music', or to what a guitarist plays as 'guitar music'. Similarly, black men in 1995 are not so afraid of being seen with a white woman that they sweat and panic. Perhpas if this book had been set in the 50's, she might have had something more than a trite and quaint race novel. then again, she might not have."
2,Not her best,"I think Taft would have been more believable if the story was actually written by a black man. I think it's arrogant for Patchett to think she can write in a black man's voice. I loved The Patron Saint of Liars, but Taft was a bit of a mess."
1,Poor source for understanding this controversial subject,It is a shame Brian Morris missed an opportunity to analyze and expose the lack of unbias objectivity in almost all the papers written on the topic of circumcision. Almost every source referenced in his book is slanted somewhat by the authors of the study. Too many of his references have conclusions that are not supported by the data presented in the paper. It is a shame he didn't bring this to light in his narrative. Probably he wanted to continue the myths that the medical community wants to protect to allow for their continued financial rewards for doing unnecessary surgeries.
1,I would give it negative stars if I could,"Brian Morris is a circumfetishist who pushes his sexual preference on little boys. For those of you who don't know a circumfetishist is someone who gets pleasure out of the idea of circumcising. Yes, they do really exist. I think that about sums it up how sick and twisted his point of view is. Skip this book. You'll be glad you did."
1,One sided rubbish.,The author has made no attempt to justify his arguments with a balanced view of all the evidence. He has only used the facts that helps him and ignored the vast majority that does not. Very poor book.
1,Overbearing and one-sided,"Getting straight to the point, this book is terribly one-sided and not very well written. It does not show the whole truth of this matter. The real truth is that most doctors do not recommend circumcision, especially ""routine"" circumcision. All the top pediatricians in the world have found circumcision to be totally unnecessary and painful and carries many dangerous complications. Just in the same way one doesn't go about pulling out all one's teeth just to avoid brushing them, one does not go hacking off body parts to avoid washing them. That's what this book is about: silly excuses for an unneeded procedure. If you're into fiction, this is the book for you. If you want the truth, look elsewhere, this book isn't happening."
1,This book stinks,I didn't like this book one bit. Ir irritated me how little the author cares about uncovering the truth of this subject. It belongs in the fiction section.
5,About time we were given some unemotional facts.,"It seems that with the contoversial topic of circumcision the facts are replaced with emotion. I work in the field of medical research and understand the need for all sides of a topic to be analyzed and discussed. Finally a book has been written that focuses on the pros of circumcision, to balance the anti-circumcision literature.This book has been well written by an internationally known medical researcher, who has done thorough research into producing this up to date review. The author is obviously ""in favour of circumcision"" but does not ignore the other side of the argument, which most people who are anti-circumcision do.If you are going to have to make a decision about circumcision, it would be best to make an informed decision and this book gives you a great insight into the topic."
1,I usually enjoy a good comedy..... but not this,"The cultural obsession with removing flesh from the genitals of children has come under increasing attack in recent years. Perhaps that is why the ghouls who actually favour the practice feel the need to step up their efforts. Brian Morris' book is a case in point.Brian Morris' book ""In Favour of Circumcision"" consists of much outdated and/or invalid evidence which has not been taken seriously by the medical community for some time. Therefore, when one has waded through all the mumbo-jumbo, one is left with the rantings and ravings of a very disturbed man with an apparent mutilation fetish and a sick desire to promote the genital cutting of children.Although I admit to laughing heartily several times while reading this book, I found my laughter interrupted by the sobering consideration that many foolish parents will take in this nonsense. I'm afraid I can't recommend this book to anyone."
1,Alarmist Drivel,"This book is unmitigated rubbish. Poorly written by a moron. He says on his website""I married at 42 and have had a lot of sexual experience""Who with? Yourself?DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,"All These Documented ""Benefits"" Can't Give Me Any Pleasure","Despite what Mr. Morris writes about the benefits of circumcision, it hasn't been so in my experience. I was hoping to be encouraged by what I read, but none of it rang true for me. I am a middle-aged Amercian, and have watched my penile sensitivity decrease over the last 10 years. Thankfully (to other books, not this one), I now know the cause, and through restoration efforts in just 5 months, I've already regained some sensitivity (Believe me, you know when you feel more.). Based on my experience, I cannot in any way, shape, or form, recommend circumcision to anyone. No amount of case studies or facts in any book can persuade or distract me from seeing the wisdom in nature's protective foreskin. I think it's ok to read this book. But it won't help circumcised men recover any of their lost sensitivity. And this is the real issue and the sad truth about circumcision."
4,Workingman's dead,"Workingman's dead being the 4th studio album from the Greatfull Dead and contains two tracks that have crossed into mainstream, i.e., ""Uncle John's Band"" and ""Casey Jones"". No lyrics are included in the booklet and the photograph is quite grainy. We get short liner notes written by Warner Bros Records. The album has received great reviews from Allmusic and Robert Christgau. 4/5."
4,Great Folk/Country Tunes,"For this album, the renowned psychedelic band the Grateful Dead took some country, some folk, a bit of blues, and fashioned some great tunes. Its execution is fairly laid back, which is typical of the group, but less typical are the consciseness of the tracks. I'm not a great fan of the Dead, but I really do like this album."
4,Where the Heck is Bobbie's voice?,"I'll tell you where. Just about non-existent. Allright I know Jerry was da man in this Gratefully Great Band from him to get the lead vocal on seven of eight tracks is a little out of balance. None the less, these are quality songs if not quite my all time favorites. Very much an acoustic driven album so keep that in mind when deciding if you want to make the investment. None the less, Jerry turns in some find guitar playing and a nice vocal on New Speedway Boogie. And Pig Pen is in top form on Easy Wind. I would pick up American Beauty and other recordings before this one. None the less, its well worth having."
4,Decent Collection of Songs,"On this record, the Dead make a turn towards folk and country forms, probably influenced by The Band and probably influencing the Rolling Stones and others. It follows on from Aoxomoxoa's better parts (especially ""Dupree's Diamond Blues""). The playing especially the drumming is minimal here.It's a good record because Garcia and Hunter came up with enough good songs to justify the approach."
5,Ballin' that jack...,"The 8 track version of this lived in my player for 3 months back in the '70's! Great production, Great arrangement, Great MUSIC! You don't have to be a Deadhead to enjoy Workingmans Dead. Favorite tune: High Time ...livin' the good liiife. Best tune: Uncle John's Band ...Come hear Uncle John's Band playing to the tide... Coolest tune: New Speedway Boogie ...It's got no signs or dividing lines and very few rule to guide.Jerry we miss ya!!!"
2,Hasn't Aged Well,"I was a *huge* Dead fan in high school and college and still like some of their music, such as ""Live-Dead"" (best effort, I say) and ""Europe '72,"" but I think ""American Beauty"" & ""Workingman's Dead"" are merely pleasant. In fact, Workingman's Dead verges on hippie easy-listening. Musically, there's nothing special here at all, and the lyrics are forgettable.I put this one in the ""how did I ever think this was a great album?"" category."
3,So Much More Potential,"No matter what the fate of his earlier works, Priyadarshan has reached a stage where audience still remembers his glorious days and patronise his latest outing in a hoping for a gratifying experience. You & me fall into the ""Khatta Meetha"" trap for this very reason. The product is not too bad, but then not up to the mark either. The audience has a disconnect as there are many places where the plot loses steam. A little bit of sincere effort could have turned the tables. The product is glossy and music is peppy but that doesn't help much. Comedy is good only at certain places."
5,A priceless gift to mothers and their children,As a mother of three anything that soothes my children and helps them calm down at the end of the day is priceless. Christine's beautiful voice and the wonderful music and lyrics are something my children look forward to drifting off to sleep to each night. It is a part of our bedtime ritual and will be for a long time to come. We too look forward to the next cd by this artist.
2,Pleasant but monotonous,"As stated in another review, it appears that this CD was made with the best intentions. Unfortunately, the musical and vocal performances on this are simply not of the calibur that one would hope. The music sounds all ""midi'd,"" or performed by uninspired musicians. This IS an independent release, so I do urge you to buy it, if only to support Independent music."
5,Music to start Dreams with,I love listening to this cd with my children. It creates a warm thought for them before they go off to sleep. My boys are 6 and 10 and choose this to put in at night! It never grows old! Thank you for a giving us such wonderful music.
5,Quite Lovely,"Beautiful; ethereal, enchanting--I know the woman from childhood and the music is truly heartfelt--"
1,lost opportunity?,"This is a sweet, sweet CD, but I don't much care for the voice and skill (unfortunately, more the lack thereof) of Christine Giuliano. I really, really like the background music, particularly on ""Tick, Tock,"" though. I would not buy this CD as a gift, as someone else suggested, not because it is bad, but just because I think there is better out there.That said, if Christine Giuliano's voice were more developed, I bet I would like the CD a lot more."
4,Psychologist,"As a psychologist working with adults healing from trauma or simply learning to love themselves more, I have used this CD very successfully for self healing. I find it to be a very important and unique tool for improving self esteem and for learning to sit quietly with oneself. In this country, contemplative practice is scarce but so necessary for finding inner peace and Christine's CD proves invaluable. Valerie Maxwell, Ph.D."
5,HEAVEN ON A DISC,"This cd is beyond precious. If audio stimulation is the key to tranquility for the human condition, this album nails it! I only advise that you not listen to it while driving as you may go into some sort of trance which could be dangerous. Listen to this when you are pregnant, giving birth, and for years to come with your bundle of love. Everyone's ""inner-child"" can benefit from these peaceful tracks. The healing power of this album is relevant for all ages. Thank you for making such a sweet and timeless treasure Christine!"
5,"Spiritual Lullabies, Songs to Honor the Child Within","I played a few clips from ""Spiritual Lullabies, Songs to Honor the Child Within"" on my morning show... what a response.. it's a must have cd for EVERYONE... it touches places in the heart.. that have been vacant for years.. and will make you smile... feel good and bring back those fond childhood memories..www.star1019.com"
4,worth the money,"I lost a barrette like this swimming last winter. I searched all over - stores, the web, amazon, to find it again. after a great deal of hunting i found it! or something very close. these barrettes are expensive but they are worth it. they last for years and look like new because they are made of extremely good materials (and well put together). i gave it four stars instead of five because of the price."
4,Classic Look.,"Classic is the best way to describe this barrette. I have a lot of hair so it takes some doing to squeeze all my hair into the clip, but once all the hair is tucked and the barrette snapped, the stay lasts. I really like the way the tones of color smoothly blend together."
3,eh,"This book is tedious. I wanted a book that told about Audrey Hepburn's personal life; instead I got a very mechanical description of the productions she was involved in. On top of that, the author's language is extremely contorted and not easy to read at all. If you're interested in learning about Audrey's movies and you're a film producer, you would probably like this book. However, if you wanted a personal story about Audrey Hepburn the person, you may well be disappointed."
3,Great Example of Progressive,"Although this CDs song choice wasn't the greatest, it was mixed well and depicts the Progressive sound!!!! If you are a fan of any Electronica genre, you could quite possibly Love this CD. Great potential!!! Check it out before you buy!"
5,Beautiful performances of terrific music,"There are some great performances here of well-known flute pieces like Honegger's Danse de la Chevre and Poulenc's Sonata for Flute and Piano, but the other tracks are also enjoyable. It is interesting to have all of the compositions of Les Six for flute solo and flute and piano on one CD.We found the album enjoyable to listen to sequentially.Recommended"
2,Totally shapeless and flat...terrible for your feet,"I'm stunned by reviews here saying that they're comfortable.They are not.There's ZERO arch support. Maybe if you have a flat, chunky foot like Fred Flintstone, they'd feel OK.And the ""window"" to return them to the shady outfit was only one month!"
3,Cute but not comfortable,"Size is true but several parts of the shoe started rubbing against my feet. After several blisters, added tape to cover some rough spots and they feel much better. I discovered I'm not a flats weaklings person - just doesn't feel comfortable and I feel too close to the ground including feeling every rough spot on the roads and sidewalks."
3,Aluminum Wire,The 17 gage spool aluminum wire is standard but the spool should have a guide that would keep it from kinking when drawn.
5,Shock wire great price,"installs so easily, just enough for smaller animals, and will give the larger animalsa nice ""bite"" also without hurting them. works exactly as statedeasy to work with, and gets the job done quickly !"
1,Very Frustrating Toy,"I don't usually review items, but I was so frustrated by this toy. My kids really wanted to play with this toy, but all they kept saying was ""uh-oh"" and ""help."" The slide and ladder don't stay on, the people don't fit well if at all and are hard to place on the pieces, and it's constantly tipping over. Very disappointing."
4,Needs a little glue,"This is one of the more fun pieces in the Ryan's Room set. However, the slide and its ladder are not connected and never stay on. Just use a little wood glue & the Ryan's Room people will really enjoy this set"
3,Swing broke very quickly,"Swing broke easily and the slide and ladder are not attached, which can be tricky for small hands. We did like the variety of items in the set. I had to glue it all back together!"
4,I think I like this more than my child,"AWesome toy, very cute, but I think I like it more than my child! She doesnt seem as enamoured - maybe she'll grow into it?"
4,Ego Friendly:,"Albeit it's almost a classic now, The Beloved had it going on with Happiness; it's dreamy, soothing, and melodic. The vocal style is sensual and deep, the lyrics, positive and real. Musically, it's mixed with a cool balance of guitar and synth, with upbeat as well as slower tracks. It has a certain moodiness that is unique.Some of my favorites are: ""Hello""-Jams!/""Your Love Takes Me Higher""/""Time After Time""/""Don't You Worry""/""Wake Up Soon."""
4,Very good family viewing,"We have watched all of the movies and found only 1or2 that were not quite as good as all the restnot bad when you get them in such a big pack, would reckamend to any family"
4,Exotic yet elegant,"Ippolitov - Ivanov, like Glazunov and Borodin, exceled at meshing the European and Oriental influences of Russian music to create beautiful melodies. This CD contains most of his famous works, outside of his symphonies. Many of the tunes are light-hearted and easy to hum to, hinting at their folk inspiration. For movie fans, some of the Turkish fragments were used in the movie ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"". The sound quality is great, along with the orchestration; great to listen to while driving thru the Arizona desert."
4,Addictive,Gameplay is smooth with X4.01 and Nvidia's 94 linux drivers. Gameplay became addictive during a rainy weekend. There was some crash issues though. Be sure to download the new patch at [the website].
1,A typical shabby print of UTOPIA,"This product is listed as French with English subtitles, which raised the hope of it being the original French version of ATOLL K. Unfortunately it is just another shabby looking public domain disc. Avoid it and get the Goodtimes version, the only half-decent version available in North America."
1,Disappointment,"It is quite rare that I do not like a book, I just can not even get thru this one.....I hate the way it is written and it just is not at all interesting."
5,Go ahead indulge! I won't tell!,"Kudos go to NAXOS for producing this sweet box of musical candy. How can a Czech conductor, Japanese violinist, and a Ausie orchestra pull off such a satisfying program of Russian folk songs? These miniatures by obscure or annoymous composers are given colorful, full-blown, lavish, orchestrations by arranger conductor Peter Breiner. To offset all the Hollywoodian sonics he has written in delicate solo violin parts especially for the esteemed Takako Nishizaki. She affectionately accents each piece.They appear together on a couple of other NAXOS compilations too! Anyone who enjoys the music of Tchaikovsky, Rimsky Korsakov, or for that matterBrahms and Dvorak, will relish this disc. Several of the selections heard here are quoted in famed Russian compositions. The sound engineering is one of NAXOS best, spacious, lush, and clear in detail.I'm sure the purists will have a problem with this, but this CD is an orchestral feast for anyone who wants one!"
1,Cannot be mistaken for a Rachel Lee--NO emotional intensity,"Whatever caused Rachel Lee to metamorphose into Sue Civil-Brown was a BIG mistake! Her three contemporaries as S. C-B. have all lacked the intensity, sensuality and emotion which made many of her pre-Conard County and Conard County books outstanding. Perhaps because I treasure some of her older books so much, my disappointment in her new work is even greater. Although I did not find her Lee books consistently good, C-B's Avon books are less enjoyable even than the Lee misses. The characters are plastic and the story is thin. I will not buy any more Avons. I hope she gets back on track. I know she can write novels that are memorable."
2,A Big Let-Down,"I was really disappointed in this one. I had heard such great things about it, but it was too wacky. Too many characters, and you didn't care a fig about any of them. It just went on and on. Rambled....and, didn't focus on anything. Not worth the time."
4,This was a very good book.,This was the first of Sue Civil Brown's that I have read. It made me want to read her other books. I hope Sue Civil Brown will keep on writing as I want to keep on reading her books.
4,this is not Rachel Lee....but....,"This is not the same type of book that Rachel Lee is acclaimed for. She is writing under the name of Sue Civil-Brown and, therefore, one expects a different type of writing and plot. In this book, she has created characters and situations which are lighter and more given to comedy than the most popular books she writes under the name of Rachel Lee. I found her characters to be engaging and very human. The ""ghost-busters"" with their dust buster ghost vacuums were pure whimsey and delightful. I, too, prefer this author's more serious books but I also understand that she fulfills the publisher's requirements and demands. Read her books under both her author names and you have variety and enjoyment. After all, she is recognized as one of the most popular writers in these fields today."
3,Way too many characters,"This book is fun and reminiscent of those early JAK stuff. However, problem lies in Ms Civil-Brown putting in too many characters - the hero, the heroine, the over-the-top mom, the plain sis, the eccentric tenants of the condo... there is little space for any emotional intensity, much less breathless passion.Also, the hero behaves like a jerk at the beginning of the book and I waited for a nice long begging-for-forgiveness session. Alas, it never came.This book is light, frothy, fun, but light in emotional intensity."
3,Beware This Willin',"This album has much to recommend it. I, for one, could not be satisfied with a Little Feat collection without the first album.But there are two songs I cannot seem to get in the mood to listen to. The first of them is the surprise -- ""Willin'."" This rendering of the song that (legend has it) got Lowell George fired from The Mothers of Invention is too jokey and silly for those of us who learned to love it through the versions onSailin' ShoesandWaiting For Columbus [Live Deluxe].The other one is called ""Crazy Captain Gunboat Willie."" I'm just not feeling it."
5,Best little feat by far,My favorite little feat album by far. I like the simplicity of the recording sounds like the are playing a single cut without a lot of mixing.
3,This album is worth buying!,"This album is worth buying if only for Forty Four Blues: How Many More Years. People go on and on about how no Feat album can match Dixie Chicken. Well, I loved Dixie Chicken, too, but if you like Lowell George, ANY of the albums he was part of are worth the price, if only to really experience his growth and change over the years."
3,Likely to Disappoint,"Buyers beware: this is not ""Dixie Chicken""! On their debut album, Lowell George & Co. had not yet found their signature funky sound. Instead, this is fairly straight-ahead country-blues-rock - think ""Exile on Main Street""-era Rolling Stones without a horn section or memorable hooks. Even the original version of ""Willin'"" lacks the clarity or beauty it would acquire on ""Sailin' Shoes.""This is not a bad album, but it's not great either, and certainly not essential."
4,A Real Charmer,"This only just misses being worth five stars. Perhaps it needs its charm to carry it over a few weak spots; maybe it looks like it was made for television - which it was - maybe it's just too easy to enjoy. Those might be reasons enough to deny it a fifth star, but it is winning in every way and extremely touching. Walken and Sarandon are amazingly good, and the story, simple and straightforward though it is, gives them endless opportunities to shine, especially when they share the screen. There are no fireworks and no great sets or settings. This a timeless small-town fantasy that a city person can enjoy many times...that's why we own a copy."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I rented this movie, and as soon as I was done watching it I went online with fingers crossed to see if it was by any chance available for purchase. I'm so glad it was! This is a charming, touching, beautifully acted movie. The characters are treated with great affection and the evocation of small-town life is wonderful. Sarandon and Walken give beautiful performances, full of subtlety and nuance. This really is one of the best things I've seen in a long time--I can't believe it's 25 years old. I'm going to buy a couple of extra copies to give as holiday gifts this year!"
5,Walken and Sarandon: So Charming!,"Christopher Walken and Susan Sarandon make a sweet, believable, and completely charming duo in this little gem of a film that is based on a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and directed by Jonathan Demme. I showed it to a group of my students recently and they were completely won over. Don't pass this one up!"
4,A Sweet Surprise,"I remember watching this movie in English Lit class in high school. Great romantic story...I think this might have even been filmed before Susan Sarandon made it big. And a fabulous performance by Christopher Walken. Tony Shaloub from Monk should rent this and take notes...anyway, great rental for anyone who loves a simple romance or just to see two great actors chew up the scenery."
5,Laughed out loud!,"My girls loved it! PLUS, they get credit for it as an AR book at school! FANTASTIC!!!"
1,Poor design,"I love Bosch tools in general but this tool is poorly designed. There is an exposed flange where the armature shaft exits the tapered bell housing near the collet that is the full diameter of the bell housing. It spins with the shaft. The bell housing is too short for an average male hand to hold the tool without contacting this spinning flange. When I hold the tool, the flange rubs against my hand and burns it from friction. It is very painful. I want to throw this tool out the door every time this happens."
3,The previous reviewer is getting boring,"As I search for texts for learning geostatistics, this gentleman's standard rant appears everywhere, copied verbatim, as welcome as a stubborn pop-up ad. He seldom discusses the specifics of the book in question, rather, he just dismisses the whole field. Well as long as we're at that level, I'd remind him Kurt Godel showed that it is impossible using usual methods to be certain that the axioms of arithmetic will not lead to contradictions. So I guess we should can anything based on arithmetic. I wonder if he also haunts the theology book review pages touting the lack of empircal proof for god's existence? It would be better to post one's intellectual grudges elsewhere."
3,Why must they sing?,"First of all, I am not a Deadhead, but I am a fan of adventurous improvisatory music. There is some beautiful guitar/bass counterpoint on this disc (notably on ""Dark Star""), and Jerry Garcia's tone is often spine-tingling. But let's be honest - these have to be some of the worst ""vocals"" ever preserved on tape. Seriously, the vocals on ""Dark Star"" are almost Shaggs-esque in their wretchedness. Also, much of the drum/percussion work is too laid back and sloppy to really kick the jams into a higher gear (though there are some exciting moments in ""The Eleven""). ""Lovelight"" is way too long, and it isn't ever intense or soulful, in my opinion (though they seem to be trying like hell). The highlights of this disc are mostly Garcia's, and the main reason I return to this album once or twice a year is to behold his mighty fretwork on ""Dark Star""."
5,The Dead at the peak of one of many heights,"If you only buy one dead album, make this it. I've had this record for quite some time now and it has been the most prevalantly listened to dead item despite my vast bootleg collection. from Phil's opening notes of Dark Star to the last goodnight this album never fails to entertain me. This record is glorious."
4,Be Grateful LIve Dead!,"If you ever attended a pre 1970 Dead concert, you know this is what they were about. 'Dark Star' is great. Turn out the lights and use your favorite consciousness altering method (meditation included) and you'll see what I mean. If you dont own this album, buy it now!"
2,Not deserving of 5 stars...,"In my opinion, this cd...well, read on. I am a fairly big Dead Head, but i did not really like this album. The dead were supposed to be great in concert, but this album still does not catch the same feeling as seeing a band in concert, just as most albums don't. Very select albums do, some are Allman Brothers, Clapton, and Frampton Comes Alive. This does not hold a candle to these albums. In a book i recently read, it votes this album as one of the worst albums ever made. I don't know if it is the worst, but it is not one of the best ""jamming"" albums. If you want a good Dead studio album, get ""Workingman's Dead."" But i'd stay away from this album, unless you're a dead head"
5,"""if it doesn't get your tail to wagging, then Jack, you a Zombie! ""","Yeah, I know it's not a complete concert but, for my money, i cannot think of a cheaper, concise, way of introducing yourself to this fine band. My favorites on here are: Dark Star, The Eleven, St. Stephen, Death Don't Have No Mercy, and capped off wit an acapella We Bid You Goodnight. Highly recommended."
5,Stage Presence,"Although not a complete show (as most enthusiasts prefer), this recording stands out mostly for its historical significance. This was the first successful attempt to capture the essence of a live show and share it with most of the world who had never seen them on stage--it was the stage that made them legendary not the recording studio. Subsequently this recording helped in the later successes of ""American Beauty"" and ""Workingman's Dead.""For me this one is special because it was my first experience, way back when, with ""Dark Star"" a classic the withstands the test of time.""Turn on Your Love Light"" is the full length version that was shortened for their first greatest hits album, ""Skeletons from the Closet."" I'm sure this was to make it more attractive for the radio. When one hears the full version one wonders why someone would ever think of cutting it!"
5,Worth it for Lovelight alone,"One of the finest reproductions of the band live in tape/disc/LP. Not just for ""Heads"" but for anyone who can appreciate improvisation, and a jam (DS>St.Stephen>Eleven>Lovelight) over an hour long."
3,Where's the Internet Programming part ???,"I had read ""Programming Python"" (Mark Lutz) befrie getting this book, and I expected a lot more on network programming than what this book provides. I would definitely call the title ""Internet Programming with Python"" false advertising.Aside from this (very annoying) shortcoming, the book might provide a good overview of the Python programming language. I didn't go over all the syntax, GUI and other topics as I already had covered them in the other book.I would recommend Programming Python over this book."
3,The weakest of Conroy's books,"I love Pat Conroy, but I just don't feel this book. I've read it over the course of several months, with many other books in between. I didn't want to abandon it completely, so I kept reading, but wasn't taken by the charackters. I loved Prince of Tides, BEach Music, The Lords of Discipline, so I was very excited about this book. But it makes me feel better that it was his first book, not last, it means he became much better writer since that first book."
4,Epitomy of Love/Hate Relationship,"I loved this book and I hated this book. Especially Bull Meecham, who I despised at times as much as I could not help but love him. All of the characters, no matter how minor, are so integral to this book, that with out any one of them, this book would not have been such a fascinating and hard to put down read. Well written, although occasionally I found myself having to go back and re-read parts because it would get a little confusing. Other times I had to go back and re-read parts because I would get so involved that I would skip over words in my haste to read more. A somewhat gritty and harsh book about an egomaniac of man, his wife and their children growing up under the highs and lows of his mood swings, in their latest home in the South. As another reviewer mentioned, Bull's personality only made him more human, something that he and other characters, especially his children, had to deal with. He was aptly named."
4,The Great Santini,"Those of you who have grown up with a military parent, or forthose who are in the military, this book will have special meaning foryou. One aspect of this book is its realism, some where in America there is some family being raised by a military parent that is dealing with the same issues this book deals with. This is a story about real life, which is why I liked it so much. Having military in my family I was able to have a special connection with the characters in the story."
2,a little disjointed,"I read this book at the suggestion of several friends, who thought it was Conroy's best. I'd just finished ""Beach Music,"" which I feel is much more developed and well-rounded. This book, with many similarities to ""Beach Music"" (both in characters and in setting), seems to be more of a rough draft of the book that Conroy later wrote.There were many scenes that were Big Scenes -- deaths, rape, violence -- and then the chapter would end and it was on to the next adventure, with little or nothing said later to tie the loose threads together.Perhaps it does take a military background to truly appreciate the book, and while the language is (as in all of Conroy's books) beautifully written, the overall story didn't hook me."
5,A Tale of Parental Abuse,"This is the third book written by Pat Conroy and his first novel. Like all his books the themes are semi-autobiographical. In this book the author's childhood suffering at the brutal hands of ""The Great Santini,"" his father's nickname for himself, is described in sickening detail. But the reader is left with admiration for this boy who finally can fight back and is on his way to a new life at age 18.I am married to a fighter pilot(who calls himself the world's greatest fighter pilot)and in all the years of his service I never saw or heard of the kind of drunken and obscene behavior by the Marine pilots that is depicted here. I can only assume that Santini himself was often the instigator of these events and proud of himself for arranging them.As a new fan of Pat Conroy's work I intend to read all his books in chronological order. So you may see another review by me before long! In the meantime, why don't you join the club?"
5,Great book!,"I have read all of Pat Conroy's books, and this one rates up there as one of my favorites of all his books."
2,Too repititous!,"This book became too ""ho-hum"". Not enough change from other books from the author. I don't believe I need to read any more of Pat Conroy's books."
5,"Thoughtful, powerful book about family dynamics","As a military brat I have surprised myself by finding ways to avoid this book over the years. I have enjoyed Mr. Conroy's other novels but for some reason assumed that the life of a military family would not interest me because I had already lived that life. I could not have been more wrong. This book was amazing. The character development was intense, the action compelling and the flow wonderful. Please pick up this book."
5,A Journey into Marine Family Life,"This classic novel takes a look at a Marine family's life. It takes place on an Marine Base in South Carolina (As most of Conroy's works take place in SC)Bull Meechum is a tough Marine who runs his family as he would a group of Marines. This is evident in the events that happen to his oldest son Ben. Ben is dealing with the conflicts of being a Marine like Col. Meechum's son. This book is a fine novel, which is meaningful not only to real Marine families,but to all families. One of Conroy's finest."
4,What a great writer Pat Conroy is....,"I haven't read a book of his since Beach Music and his writing style is just awesome. I know this one is older, but I just never picked it up, but I am glad I did. There is not a ton of action, but the character development is top notch, just awesome."
1,Beware of Blackstone,"While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very ""nasal"" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare!"
3,The Great Santini,"Although I am quite taken with Pat Conroy, I was not particularly fond of this book. The characters were not believable enough to develop feelings for and Bull Meecham was not a likeable character at all. I love the descriptive ""poetry"" he uses in his novels, though. Many other readers seem to love this book- maybe it's a military family thing."
3,Powerful but flawed,"Just like the title character of this book, the novel itself is powerful but flawed. While I was caught up in the maelstrom of family relations and spellbound by the character of Bull Meecham, there were too many times where events where whipped up and then cut off, leaving the reader with no resolution. It was ridiculous the way Conroy skipped describing the after effects of traumatic events on the family dynamics, which is the reason we're all reading the book in the first place.Also, while the descriptions of Bull's experience while flying and his thoughts of what a fighter pilot is were poetic, they really didn't add to the story and became repetitive by the end of the book.I would recommend this book if you haven't read a real powerful novel before (and Sheldon and Steel don't count) but if you've read about real family dysfunction in other good novels, this one doesn't really go all the way."
4,Insight into life in a military childhood,"This is the second book of Pat Conroy's that I have read (the first was ""The Water is Wide"", which was his first book, I believe). It was gripping, disturbing, uplifting, all the more so, because he based it on his own relationship with his father. I especially found it admirable that he was able to be so brutally honest about his feelings towards his father, mother and institutions like the Catholic church.This all hit home with me, having been raised by a mother who was a devout Catholic as a child (and carrying all the attendant guilt that goes with it) and also having a husband who, after 17 years in the Army, can tend towards being a bit heavy-handed with my (and his) children and unable to express his feelings. I can see parallels in this book with the experiences my sons must have gone through trying to relate to their step-dad.This is a well-written book which I would highly recommend."
3,Bird didn't really love it or hate it,"She didn't really love it or hate it. Picks at it a little, but she is a 20 year old lovebird."
4,McDavid Neoprene Sleeve,I purchased these pads for my younger brother. The package contains two pads. They fit great and offer superb protection. Highly recommended for all the football lineman out there.
4,light and protective,its light and protective. It's very good. It just seem to become stuck to the arm when I begin to sweat
3,Forearm protection,This forearm device is a bit too thin to offer much protection for sparring and blocking. It has a snug fit and if all you need is a little protection then this is a good choice. It does cause sweating.
3,GOOD album,"I'm a great SP fun,but i think this is the worst album they made.That doesn't mean this is a bad album,but i found it overworked,too many effects,the sound is not clear always distorted,and i prefer the other albums because they were less complicated.But they are the smashing pumkins and they remain great"
4,SIMPLY SMASHING,EVEN THOUGH THEY DISBANDED THE PUMPKINS STILL ROCK.EVEN THE BALLADS ARE GREAT.THE PRODUCTION IS SOLID. ALL I CAN SAY IS BILLY CORGAN WRITES GREAT SONGS. GOOD LUCK TO HIM.
5,Pure Rock and Roll,"Amazing. I don't know what to say that no one else has already. This album is amazing. I love all of their albums. The Pumpkins have a nak for capturing a moment and so whenever you hear a song, you instantly get transported to the moment in your life when you first heard that song. I loved Mellon Collie. I loved Siamese Dream. I loved that other one I can't remember now. Machina is a great last step in the progression. It's the top of Everest. I love this album. It nods my head and swings my arms and keeps me wishing I was Jimmy behind the drumset banging out all those incredibly sick beats. Buy it. Buy it."
4,The Pumpkins at the blandest,"this cd is pretty cool. i mean, some of the songs are really good, but many of them are just...eh. If your looking for a good pumpkins cd, get adore or mellon collie and the infinite sadness. If you like em after those, try this one. It is a good cd, but i expected more from the pumpkins."
4,"Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy,Jimmy...","What I actually have to say is very little. For thoose of you who found that Adore CD entertaining, start your engines. It's back, with a new upgrade. Here's the recipe: one(1)sick drummer named Jimmy Chamberlin. one(1) almost back to normal pumpkins album. there it is, Machina. I like the album, but not like I enjoy pisces iscariot and previous albums. this album is for the true pumpkin fan out there thatis willing to listen to those really long songs so that you get the whole mesage(yes, I am talking about glass). power to them, but lets hope for more ""stand inside..."" on the follow up to this one. that song has some sick beats and the workings that grew on us from MCIS. ""What I choose is my choice""-Billy Corgan"
2,i am the iscariot,"i refuse to believe this is a pumpkins album. adore was considered a ""failure"" but to me, it was very lyrically and instrumentally beautiful. i don't listen to it much, cause it depresses the hell out of me, but i think it's a damn good album. i was looking forward to machina, but i still can't believe what a disappointment it is. though billy remains one of my favorite songwriters, the songs did not match the music. i rather just read the words and put on some headphones and listen to some gish. and i've been hearing this album being compared to a mix of gish and siamese dream. that's an insult to the genuistic past that the pumpkins had. and christ, get d'arcy out of rehab and bring her back."
2,My Review,"This CD was not the pumpkins' best. The only songs that I really liked on this CD were ""Heavy Metal Machine"" and ""Everlasting Gaze"". Where did all the ROCK go? Most of these songs are soft rock."
3,BILLY STILL TRYING TO GO ELECTRONIC,HES LOST THE ZEITGEIST. OVERLONG AND DULL. SOME SONGS ARE WORTHY . COULD HAVE TRIMMED TO 11 OR 12 SONGS FOR A GREAT ALBUM. SEE HE IS TRYING FOR ALBUM SALES AFTER DISSAPOINTING SELLS OF ADORE
2,Disapointing,"The hype was about Billy return to his rock roots after the commercial flop of Adore. This to a part is true, the album does indeed rock far more than it predecessor, but that does not nessasarly make it a good album, for good album we need good songs, Machina does have good songs but way to few of them. The major problem is that just to many of the songs sound the same and tend to drift by without making an impression, i've owned the CD for a few weeks now, but still can't place all the titles to the songs. So on a whole I found this quite a disapointing album, with few highlights......Must do better."
2,"Good background noise, not good listening","I'd like to qualify this by saying that I'm a huge Pumpkins fan. I particularly like Siamese Dream and Melon Collie. But with Adore, they started to sound a little stale, and I think Billy set out to prove all critics wrong at that point. Machina makes use of the talented new drummer and brings a much harder edge that adore was lacking. But what they haven't managed to right is the feeling that they don't have anything more to say with their music. The lyrics here just aren't the beautiful lyrics I remember - and miss - from the earlier albums. I play this in the background while I do other things, not to listen to directly"
2,Just buy the single,"To me this album was a desperate attempt by corgan to regain the stature the Pumpkins gained with Melancholy and Siamese dream. The detuned guitars, vocals, and novel lyrics seem forced. The only real jem on this album is Stand Inside Your Love. It is a one of the best ballads Corgan has ever writen. It's beautiful lyrics key in perfectly with the soaring guitar solo and detuned harmony. Other than that songs like ""Heavy Metal Machine"" a terrible attempt at that same title and ""I of the Morning"" a failed ballad ruin the rest of the album. On the bright side: at least they got their drummer back."
3,The Great Album That Almost Was,"well, having listened to smashing pumpkins for about a decade now, i can say this album is their worst effort. The problem is not as much the songs as the production. This whole album suffers because it sounds too saturated. I think Billy reworked just about every song on here to sound more ""radio-friendly"", which explains ""I of the mourning"" (maybe the worst pumpkins song to date). Hardly ever on this cd does the music go off in a weird direction or have a chance to breathe, which are tricks the pumpkins used to do so well. There are a few highlights here, like ""blue skies bring tears"" and ""age of innocence"". This turned out to be a decent album for modern rock standards, but way below pumpkins standards."
2,not their best,"this cd is definitly not the smashing pumpkins best work. the songsare so slow to develop in to anything and when they begin to have agood moment something else gets introduced that just ruins it. i liked siamese dream alot, along with Mellon Collie, one of the best cd's i own, but WHY does everyone bash on adore all the time? it's their most MUSICAL cd, it has so many good things about it, you just have to sit down and give it a good listen a few times, cause it doesn't just do the pop radio formula to a hit song that everyones used to; with a little riff and a verse, a bridge, verse, chorus,verse, chorus,end. the try to do the music art thing a little bit, but i will admit the cover book is really, really stupid. By the way, if you want a good, musical band, DAVE MATTHEWS BAND!"
1,They're finished!,Time to pack it in Mr Corgan and get out while you can. This cd is long and boring. It is sad that not one song on this disc is memorable and is torture just to get thru one. Fond memories of Siamese and Gish I will cherish for years when they were such a powerhouse back in the old days. The sound on this disc is terrible and the songs are too long and pointless. I never thought I would say this but another Adore would of been better. D'arcy had the right idea to bolt. It's over.
5,A new twist,"I was intially skeptical and nervous when first popping oven my new cd. However, this fear was erased when listening to such songs as The Everlasting Gaze and Wound. These two songs typify the beautiful mesh of the album. If you like softer songs off of Melancholie such as Tonight, Tonight, or other instruments such as violins utilised inthe pumpkins music like Disarm, you will love this cd. If you are interested in total hard core---this cd doesent have it. It falls more along the lines of adore in that respect not Siamese Dream. However, if you ever liked the Smashing Pumpkins, this is a must have."
5,Excellent,"I have been anticipating this album for a long time, and when i picked it up it didn't disappoint. The highlights of the CD are: Everlasting Gaze, Stand inside your love, I of the Mourning, Heavy metal machine, The imploding voice, and Wound. However, every song is good, and i would urge anyone who is a fan of the pumpkins (or even if you're not)to go pick this one up, it's great"
4,Pleasant,"This CD Is OK- i liked all their other albums better (though I havent heard gish yet...) Siamese Dream was the best. And this comes in 4th.But I still really like this. My favorite song is Stand Inside Your Love- the lyrics are very moving. I also like Glass and Ghost Children, Wound is really cool, With Every light is peaceful. Most of the songs are listenable, some are extremely likable. Hopefully Everlasting Gaze and Stand Inside Your Love will be popular on the radio so the backstreet nsync thing wears out and the pUmpkins can be the gods of TRL and the radio. That would be schweet. Machina is worth a good listen. Possibly good music to sleep too. I thought the album would be heavy rock like everlasting gaze and heavy metal machine. But those are the only two songs. Most else actually sounds similar to Adore though Corgan say's it doesnt and nobody else does. I dunno, maybe its just me. Anyhow, give Machina a shot."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,Man were the pumpkins something back to the albums Gish-mellon collie & the infinite sadness and look at this garabage! the Pumpkins were awesome back in the day and now they are just has-beens. they should have broken this band up after Adore.
2,BORING!,"this album is dull, it is boring, and, most importantly. it sounds forced. say what you want about ""adore"", but at least then the pumpkins were doing what they wanted, and then, when it is recieved poorly, they are forced to take back jimmy chamberlain (who has gotten pudgy in person and just plain BAD as a drummer) and play sonic guitar rock, and that's exactly what they don't want to do, but they are being forced to, and so it seems contrived, and they are not happy. this album is a phony, a desperate attempt to win back fans lost to the synth-lidden landscapes of ""adore""...no wonder d'arcy left...melissa auf der maur is going to have to BEG courtney love to get her job back, and i hope she doesn't get it, just because she was a part of this mindless drivel that is ""MACHINA""..by the way, HOLE ROCKS! billy corgan should lick the tar of of courtney's boots..."
1,TOTAL TRASH,i guess expect to much. But i grew up listening to Eddie Van Halen. But these guys realyare deadhead's.My cat sing's better. Van halen will alway'sbe my king of ROCK.
2,Smashing Pumpkins Paint-by-Numbers,"Wow. Easily the worst Pumpkins album. Machina II, available via Internet only, is so much better, and it's free. This album is a formulaic, uninspired, as subtle-as-a-jackhammer ""effort."" ""Everlasting Gaze"" sounds like a Pumpkins self-parody. Corgan's a cappella bridge borders on the ridiculous, and the song contains none of the swells and sways that characterized their seminal songs, such as ""Tonight, Tonight,"" ""1979,"" ""Zero,"" or ""Cherub Rock."" Those who say this is a better album than ""Adore"" need their ears re-examined. Those expecting ""Adore"" to be a typical Pumpkins hard-rocking effort are bound to be disappointed, but in my opinion ""Adore"" rocks so much harder than Machina in its subtlety and emotion. In fact, ""Adore"" is one of SP's best albums. Machina sounds like some second-rate poseur band trying to copy the Pumpkins formula and failing miserably."
2,Forgettable,"I was reading about this disc on Amazon just the other day, and thought to myself, ""Hey, I'm a big Smashing Pumpkins fan. Why don't I own this album?"" I went over to my CD collection and behold, I do own it. So I listened to it again once and it's back on the shelf. The first 3 or 4 songs are pretty good, but the rest of the tracks are uninspired. Billy Corgan can whine or scream. I like the screaming best. But he whines through most of this album and the music either whines along with him or drowns him out. If you're thinking about this, get the greatest hits instead. I think it has a few of the good songs from this one and all the [bad] music is confined to the second disc so you can just throw it away and never have to listen to it."
1,time for a career change,The Pumpkins are well past their use-by date. Their songs are so meaningless and repetitive that the album is not even worth reviewing. Please don't waste your time or money on this NOISE!
2,After this I'm glad they called it quits,"Pretty much garbage. Touted as their ""return to rock"" but it's more like their ""return to sinking deeper into the mire of our overwrought angst."" Kind of surprising after ""Adore,"" which was really kind of an upswing for them (them being Corgan, D'Arcy and Iha then). The funny thing is, the music generally shows promise, as with the first few bars you're tapping your foot along with the melody, then BAM in comes the cracking whine of Corgan, much more whiney than ever (and I thought it wasn't even possible!). You then realize the music is generic and uninspired, at best. Oh well. At least all of the other Pumpkins releases are worth owning."
1,Among the most painful CDs of recent memory,"If you enjoy going to your dentist you'll have no trouble loving this album. Not only is the music totally unoriginal, but the Pumpkins insist on drowning it all with heavily distorted bass chords that seem to be a pet peeve of the recording engineer. Add to that the self-consciously and mostly impenetrable nasal voice of Corgan and you get a band who seems to be making a quick point of entry as your garden variety vegetables."
1,Worts up?,"I thought Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"" was the worst album ever made, but this one takes the biscuit. Billy Pumpkin once again squirts out some more pretentious, pompous rot for the masses who forgot (or never knew?) what good music is. Thusly, this is not (good)."
4,Pumpkins Last Hope,"This album is very good but the only problem with the album is that it felt like the Pumpkins didn't care about this album as much as there other album. For example it doesn't fell like Billy wrote the album with his heart, more like with his fans hearts. But beside for that little problem it is still a great Underated album that any rock fan well like. So do yourself a favor and pick up this album and dont listen to jackass that tell you that tell you the Pumpkins are dead because they are still around in all there fans hearts."
4,Prelude to a Zwan,"Most commercial release? If I remember correctly it was this release that led to the eventual breakup of the pumpkins. I thought their label felt it was less marketable than '1979' and 'Tonight Tonight's flavorings. Personally, I think 'The Everlasting Gaze', 'Stand Inside Your Love', and 'Wound' are three of their best tracks ever. The production is down right thrilling in its shimmering noisiness. Flood obviously has reached a new level of artistry in his production. However, Corgan's exploration of his divine conduit delusion does get a bit much in some of the lyrics and especially in that one drawing that portrays the ""machines"" resuming their...ahumm...sermon. But I give him credit for even admitting it, and then having the guts to find out where embracing it would lead him. There's a special magic that touches quite a few moments on this disk and I'm glad I own it."
3,"So close, but yet so far","This, the last properly released Pumpkins studio album, could well have been classic. The first five songs indicate this--""Raindrops + Sunshowers"" and ""I of the Mourning"" are two of the best songs Billy Corgan's ever written--but then the album falls prey to Corgan's usual excess. ""Heavy Metal Machine"" is a good example of this, an overproduced, underwritten, six-minute monstrosity that oozes and seeps but is too weighted down to actually go anywhere. Things don't get much better from there, either. ""Glass and the Ghost Children"" is another ten-minute prog-rock experiment, in the vein of a much less successful ""Porcelina of the Oceans Vast"" from Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.Unfortunately, the band never regains its early momentum after these two songs, although the faux-Broadway ""With Every Light"" gives a valient effort. It's too bad that this will be known as the band's swan song--a little bit of trimming on Corgan's part, and it could have been a lot better."
4,It's almost over....,"This record, the final Pumpkins release is surprisingly heavy. While ""Heavy Metal Machine"" has too many layers of distortion, the thunderous melodies crush everything in its path. There still is the bizarre (Crying Tree, my least favorite), the mellow (With Every Light), the electronic (Raindrops and Sunshowers), and the moderate (The Sacred and Profane).Yes, I will admit, this is partially ""Die-hard Pumpkin"" material, but I admire them for all they've done. Never failing for a good album, the Pumpkins bid farewell. We will miss you."
5,Another Perfect Album,"What else can I say? An album that will blow even the non-avid Smashing Pumpkins listener away. It's one of the higher points of their rocky career. It's fast, slow, loud, quiet, beautiful, whiny, and everything else you love about them wrapped in one big bundle of love."
4,"Inspiration Yes, Trepidation No","The Pumpkins are a legendary band. All their albums have some musical merit, regardless of the extremists contentions. Machina, taken as a singular production detached from SP's previous work, is a excellent album. Rife with riffs, muddled with melancholy, this last album by the Pumpkins (presumably, D'arcy is out) will please."
3,Not better than Mellon Collie,"I don't think this is better than the '95 Album which would be the so call final of the SM. Actually there are some good songs I could call my ""in mood songs"" like 'Everlasting Gaze', 'This Time',....and my favorite of all is 'Sacred and Profane' what do I think about this album? Billy is still whinning and showing rage of the rat in the cage, but less bombastic and heartbreak notes and music instrument (like in the Mellon Collie), and more rock. It is maybe I am not yet in the mood to grab all the songs in here. And this album more confirms me that ""Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"" is so exclusive and unique. There is none higher than that."
2,My Personal Opinion,"Although I'm an extreme Pumpkin's fan.. I don't think that I care very much for their new sound. I'm a fan of their old work such as Gish, Siamese Dream (one of the BEST albums), LOVED Pisces Iscariot.. Meloncholy & Infinite Sadness was beautiful, but after that I feel that they went to a whole different level when they really should've stayed where they were at musically and not have tried to follow the continuous changes that the ""mainstream"" was going through. Their new stuff doesn't sound a bit like their past unique sound, which had made them (in my personal opinion) one of the best bands out there. Too bad."
1,goofball,the pumps first CD was dope. now they are even cornier than that goth sketch on sat night live. this is a bad cd. a bad rock cd. a bad pop cd. a bad smashing pumpkins cd.
1,THIS ALBUM BLOWS,I like the Smashing Pumpkins. I saw them live in 1996. Some of you revewiers were probably 5 at the time. Anyway they clearly went down hill. They should have stopped after Adore which was good. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is clearly their musical peak. What happened to this band. They became too dark. I actually like Zwan better then this last Pumpkins album. Most of the album is too weird. Compare it to their last two albums and you know I am right. They went down hill.
2,1 good song,"Everyone told me to buy this cd. So I went out and bought it. I liked one song only. ""Stand inside your love"" My money was waisted. I WAS MAD."
2,Reeks of desperation,"Oh Billy, Billy. What are you doing? Are you that desperate to regain the spark you had? ""Machina"" is pretentious over-achievement-not a good thing. Why is it this is the only Pumpkins album I found absolutely nothing to grasp onto? When ""Adore"" came out you were so hyped about it and it's new direction, as was I. I liked that album a lot. Now all I hear from you is how much of a misstep that one was and how this is a return to form. I don't think so. Absolutely no chances were taken on this one. All I hear are a bunch of fuzz guitars and pretentious lyrics hiding non-existant songs. Besides that many of the slower-tempo songs sound straight out of 1985, but I digress. Come on Billy. Remember that little contest you had in your head with Trent Reznor? Well, with the ""Fragile"" out the score at this point is Trent-4, Billy-4 with the clock of relevance ticking rather quickly. Irrevelance-fear it Billy."
2,Over-rated like the rest of their stuff,"Sometimes I think the Pumpkins developed their fan base, just because they're so awful. (Believe me, if you've ever seen one of their concerts, their utter lack of talent shows in every regard.) Kids go for it, simply because their parents hate it. This album continues that trend with (what's supposedly the best songs) the dreadful ""Everlasting Gaze"" and the equally lifeless ""Stand Inside Your Love."" They have the best production money can buy, some occasionally interesting guitar riffs, and Billy Corgan's usual none-too-pleasant-for-the-ears vocals. Stay away bigtime from this album and, if you insist, opt for the Gish or Siamese Dream. Better yet, get real rock n roll like Zeppelin, Van Halen, or Montrose."
3,Pumpkins disappoint again,"Just like Adore the Pumpkins hit us with a great first single only to disappoint us when the full album is released. Have the Pumpkins forgotten how to rock? I think so. I long for the days of Siamese Dream. This album will completely put you to sleep after the first 4 songs. It was a good beginning but a poor middle and end. I guess I'll just have to be satisfied with Gish, Pisces Iscariot, Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie."
1,How could anyone like this,I though when there last album came out that they could never make anything that bad again Gee Whiz was wrong.machina is clearly the favorite for many as the years worst album unless nsync makes 2 or 3 albums even then Pumpkins still might have the worst album.Dont we all wish for the glory days od Siamese dreams
3,Their second worst album yet - but still pretty good,"The first six songs constitute a solid start to the CD. ""Everlasting Gaze,"" ""Stand Inside Your Love"" and ""Sacred and Profane"" are excellent tracks (especially Sacred and Profane). However, the CD trails off after song #6. Try Try Try is too sappy and has no rock heart to it. Heavy Metal Machine is abominable. I really think that is SP's worst song ever. After that, the songs are arty and not rock-solid or catchy or anything good. This album is better than Adore, but does not beat out Gish, Pieces Iscariot, Siamese Dream, or Mellon Collie (then again, which albums do?)."
4,you'll either love it or hate it,"I Loved it! How did he get the best elements of 80's music, the best ingredients in mellon collie, and his awful vocals to blend into such an excellent cd. I think a lot of the songs sound almost exactly alike, but I can tolerate it because they are good songs, and besides, the SP's always do that. I love this cd, I dont skip any tracks, I just listen to it straight through. (Serving suggestion: listen to it with mellon collie, maybe make a mix tape)"
4,Another great one by the pumpkins,"This album is a little more obscure than normal, but it also has beautiful melodies that you will surely like."
5,Good Follow Up From ADORE.,"This album makes Adore look terrible. Songs like ""The Everlasting Gaze"" and ""With Every Light"" give this album a typical Pumpkin feel. Jimmy Chamberlin has made a huge differance to this band. His drumming makes these songs incredible. Its almost worth getting the cd just for the drumming and the artwork, which is sensational. Best Tracks: The Everlasting Gaze, Age Of Innocence, Stand Inside Your Love, Wound and With Every Light. Buy this album. Its worth the money."
3,This review is purely a gut reaction,"If you check my past reviews, you will find I am always open to an artist's reinvention of themselves. Adore was something I just didn't adore (sorry about that, it was easy to take). So I was excited that they could be reverting back to the psychedelic/loud-soft-loud/alterna-rock kings that were the Smashing Pumpkins.So here I have it, playing it, and it is not a return to Siamese Dreams or (especially my favorite) Gish. A condensed Mellon Collie is what I have. Which isn't bad, but not what I had hoped for.Songs like THE EVERLASTING GAZE and GLASS AND THE GHOST CHILDREN will undoubtedly grow on me and I'll like some others along the way....I'm not that opposed to this effort....but MAN OH MAN I wish Billy would let that guitar rip a little more like he used to. I also think he is using too many effects on his voice. I don't know, it just didn't give me that anticipated rush I needed. Not like Siamese Dreams gave me after Gish. Oh well, it's pretty good."
3,higher fidelity version of their older sound,"This is not a bad album, it's not a landmark either. It sounds like the band returned to the formula that put them at the top of the heap, polished up the sound a little, and put some workmanlike songs behind it all. Presto! While they probably could have done much worse and gotten away with it, at least they haven't completely abandoned pop sensibility with this set of songs, so despite Corgan's ever-annoying pubescent voice and attitude and almost too much high frequency info in the mix when the distorted guitars are cranked up, it's a listenable release. But beware, there's no ""1979"" here..."
5,astounding,"this is a marvelous album, and a huge departure from Adore, although that was a great album as well. The thing about the Pumpkins is that their songs vary wonderfully, and Adore was great for what it was:a pop album.On Machina, Billy is once again gripping the music industry by the balls in his pale hands. Strong, tight songs like, ""Stand Inside Your Love,"" and, ""This Time,"" meld into languid, neo-psychedelic jams like, ""Glass and the Ghost Children.""But while Billy's songwriting is still as fresh as ever, one of the main highlights of the album is Jimmy Chamberlin's drumming, which is phenomenal. He totally goes nuts on, ""The Everlasting Gave,"" and, ""I of the Mourning,"" but still remains in the background.This album is proof that the Pumpkins can do anything. They are excellent as a pop band, but if they truly want to rock, the only person who can keep up with them is Jimmy."
4,Mostly good,"This Pumpkins album takes a few listens to get into, but the rewards are worth it. Yes, Billy Corgan can be an egomaniac, but at least most of that energy is directed into the music, instead of the lame bad-boy posing so prevalent with the so-called metal-rap genre. My favorites so far are the first three tracks, but most of the rest has grown on me. The two exceptions are the overlong, needs-to-be-deleted 'Glass and the Ghost Children' and the meandering, tedious 'Blue Skies Bring Tears'. Methinks the album would have been much stronger without them. As for the listeners that disliked 'Adore' and liked this CD - there is quite a bit of 'Adore' influence here. Quite strange. For casual fans of the Pumpkins, this CD will grow on you.P.S. The Philip Welsh review further down appears to be from someone who is very impressed with himself and his collection of phrases. Would be truly impressive if his review actually had a point..."
4,Wish they'd have gone back to their roots . ..,"I will admit to being an ardent SP lover. I have been since Siamese Dream, Pisces Iscariot, et. al. I thought this album would build on where they went with Adore, which I liked very much. Unfortunately, this was not to be. This album is a plateau, with many of the tunes largely forgettable. ""Stand Inside Your Love"", ""Raindrops + Sunshowers"" would be the standouts, and ""Age of Innocence"" a one-off worth listening to. The rest of the album could have been left on the floor, so to speak. I hope they plan on coming together again sometime in the future to rectify this. A throwback to the Gish/Siamese Dream/Pisces era would be nice."
5,The Pumpkins really rock again,"I have just finished listening to this cd for the first time and it rocks. Its not too often I listen to a new release and like the whole thing after on listen. I am a long time Pumpkins fan, and I hated the departure from the standard Pumpkins the last 2 albums were. In fact I missed the Pumpkins. I glad to have them back in my life rockin my gourd."
3,it's not their best but it is good,"i think that machina is a good album do to songs like stand inside your love, everlasting gaze, and wound but the mixed music is too loud and some of the lyrics suck but otherwise it is good."
2,Adore is much much better,"This thing has some unabashedly radio-friendly BS and then a couple of mediocre axe grinders, all in all a very tepid last poof from what was once an exciting band. Adore was so wonderful...too bad, an opportunity really lost here. And they [were bad] in concert playing these songs."
4,"well, 4.5 actually, great album","just wanted to be the first to review this album. this is a great cd of melodic rock and grungey pop. while being too long and self loving there is some classic pumpkins. They return with some of their best ever work moving away from the last album, Adore, which sucked big time. they prove beyond a doubt that they can still rock better than anyone."
2,the pumpkins have lost it,"disapointing, jus disapointing, I've listened to this album almost every day for two months and it isn't working, sp are in a music free fall, corgan can't write a good riff anymore, or even write a song that you can listen all the way through without wanting to shoot yourself, I'm talking musically here, he still writes some good lyrics here or there, but I can't stand his big ego, he should listen to pearl jam or the pixies a little more so he can remember how to make a great song, so good bye to sp, once a great band now a pretensious and commercial product. that's what you get billy for trying to copy cobain in everything: total musical block"
2,A drama whose plot is lost...,"In which our tortured hero retreats from the front lines and takes refuge, battered and withdrawn, in past glories. Pity he listened to departing fans and zealous critics after Adore, a glorious battle whose victory was one of integrity rather than bounty. Surely he can't miss the irony in his own words - ""what is it you want to say?"" This time, sadly, he says nothing. Methinks he punishes us!"
1,The Worst of 2000?,"Unintelligent, contrived, commercial-dollar-begging,pretentious, overproduced, underwritten, egotistical, desperate: all words to describe this reprehensible recording. Billy Pumpkin's worst and thankfully last album that Billy paints himself to be some kind of rock and roll martyr: HE WAS RIGHT. He deserves a good martyring after this. I didnt want to give in to my dislike for this album so I waited to write my review for a motnh after so I could give it a chance. It obviously didn't work... The one half-way salvageable song: Stand Inside Your Love. This is a single with a collection of throwaway b-sides. Billy will not be missed even though he's gonna return with his new travesty, The Marked. He's so deep."
2,I LOVE the PumPkiNs that are in the process of SmaSHinG . . .,". . . but, back when this came out, I could only bear a few listens to MACHINA before I knew I'd never go back to it. Don't be fooled by the cool title. There's a reason why this is their last official release: the magic is M.I.A. This is the last album a new collector should get by the Pooompkeens (as the Brits say), and really, only if you're a die-hard fan. The talent is here, dying to cut through, but I have to say, not a single tune here truly turned me on. Disagree all you want, it's my honest opinion. (hey, my review is #666 - fire!)"
4,Highs and Lows...,"While I think Machina is the Smashing Pumpkins' least strong album, I do enjoy much of it. Age of Innocence, for example, is one of my top-ten favorite Pumpkins songs, period. I also really like I of the Mourning, Stand Inside Your Love, Sacred and Profane, Blue Skies Bring Tears, and Glass and the Ghost Children. I must say, though, I am shocked that people like the Crying Tree of Mercury. I think it is, without a doubt, the worst Smashing Pumpkins song ever, and furthermore has the distinction of being the only Smashing Pumpkins song I truly hate (and I am a pretty passionate Pumpkins fan). Furthermore, before reading the reviews on Amazon.com, I had never met a single other person who disagreed on this matter. Just goes to show ya, different strokes, I guess. But, man, I can't even bear listening to Crying Tree..."
5,Amazing,"This CD has to be one of the best CD's ever made. I admit that I am a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan but that's not why I like this CD. To me Billy Corgan is able to place his feelings onto the tracks which makes this is by far the most emotional CD the Pumpkins have ever done, even more the Adore. Its the romantic side of Billy in the sense of loss and longing. Many people don't like this CD as much as older Pumpkins work, because it is different. The song aren't earth moving rock songs with powerful rifts. These songs are soul crashing rock songs. I highly recommend this CD for everyone who is open minded. This is the perfect ending CD for the Pumpkins that leaves the listener satisfied."
2,Disappointed,"Well I am have to disagree with most of the reviews. This album is not a great one. Let me start by saying that I am a huge pumpkins fan, I have all their stuff and love most of it. I even love Adore. Machina doesn't come close to any of their old greatness. The songs have forgettable melodies and not too much new in terms of sound or composition. I was very disappointed. While I listened to the album only 2 or 3 songs stood out as good and that is not enough to carry an album this long. Sorry guys but this is not a good album."
2,not worth it,"pure NOISE! there is at least 4 great songs on this cd. they are all monotonous, same guitar noises all throughout. there's not a lot of variety. Mellon Collie is still the best and next to it is the Siamese."
1,"""let me die"" instead of listening to this record","i'm a huge SP fan and i saw them on their resume the pose tour but i'm so embarassed for the smashing pumpkins man. this is an atrocious record and a betrayal for those who really idolized Billy. i am starting to not like billy because he thinks that HE (not even his band) can save rock and roll. the only thing this album does is put rock and roll out of its bloody misery......billy, it's time to retire......i liked gish and siamese dream, this just sucks (i don't recall songs as bad as sunshowers and that heavy metal song since freakin adore)"
1,third rate self-indulgence,"this is by far the worst pumpkins album ever. yes, it is a lot like adore, but adore sounded good live. here the the instruments give way completely to billy corgan's nasal (but lovable) voice. why is this a mistake? it isn't necessarily. but he is no james labrie; he lacks enough control of his voice to carry any song properly and/or at least interestingly. this album, instead of being far from modern pop, is closer than he has ever come. being simple is fine and good, being simplistic is not, which is what we have here. if you're looking for the pumpkins at their (his) best, check out gish and maybe pisces. this is a step further in the direction of adore which is another step backwards for the band. this album will make peace with u2 fans and disappoint anyone looking for the musical proficiency and talent that once separated the pumpkins from the rest of pop."
1,"If you want to respect the SP, forget this album.","Their first albums were powerful and they will be legendary. Adore was awesome, deep, dark, and it kind of announced the death of the band. ""Machina"" is some kind of over-produced, well-tamed, meaning-less effort to remind people they were a rock band, with a concept that interests nobody. Even the cover of the album looks stupid. And what's that song ""Heavy-metal machine""? Billy once said it was a condemnation and a glorification of the genre. Come on, that's non-interesting and pathetic. They should have ended the Smashing Pumpkins after ""Adore"". Now, they just look like ""Aerosmith"", after Permanent vacation. I'm gratefull of Billy Corgan for breaking the band after that album!"
1,A DISASTER. SMASHING PUMPKINS GO OUT WITH A WHIMPER.,"Smashing Pumpkins have been getting worse and worse with each CD. All I can say is thank god they are breaking up.""Machina"" is an absolute mess. The songs all sound like garbled productions. The vocals are weak at best and the production feels rushed.There is not one stand out song on this CD. The worst of the songs are ""I Of the Mourning"" ""The Imploding Voice"" and ""Wound"".The only imaginative thing in this CD is how they titled their songs. They should be titles for Anne Rice novels.A definite miss."
1,BIG A present,My Ted gave this to me for theBIG A. And I did not like it.We Love Ozzy and we thought itbe great to hear something abit new. Low and behold it wasnot to our liking. This groupneed's some lesson's from OZ.
4,Falls a bit short.,"I listened to this album and I started wondering where all those bad reviews for it came up. While the album is not perfect, it is still worthy of the Smashing Pumpkins name. It has a big epic feel in it, and only during ""Glass And The Ghost Children"" does it drag. If you a fan of the Pumpkins, then you should definitely check out this album. P.S. I still don't see why people thought ""Adore"" was such a travesty. It was a very gorgeous record."
4,This is not Siamese Dream 2,"...but it's still a quality Pumpkins release. Sonically, it's the offspring of Mellon Collie and Adore; structurally its songs are more complex than Siamese Dream's or Gish's, but it's easy to tell this *is* a Pumpkins release. There are hard songs (Gaze, Heavy Metal Machine, The Imploding Voice), slower songs (Glass..., Try Try Try), and ones in between (Stand Inside Your Love, This Time), like their other discs. After listening a few times, I began to appreciate each song, and finally decided that there is no filler. If you're a Pumpkins fan, you probably already have this. If you're borderline, you owe it to yourself to listen. A richly textured work."
3,Machines Indeed,"Corgan and team are proficient at what they do, but this album lacks heart and soul."
3,Machina blows away Adore,"This marks a return to better things for the Pumpkins. While not anything close to Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie there are a few songs on this CD that really pack a punch. ""The Everlasting Gaze"" and ""Stand Inside Your Love"" are easy classics and will get huge radio play. You'll have to dig a little deeper to get lots of enjoyment out of the other tracks, but it should be worth it. If you're a pumpkin fan, buy it for sure, if not you'll like a few songs on it but that's all I garuntee."
3,Quantity over quality,"An over the top outing for the Pumpkins that left me exhausted. They are unquestionably talented as all get out, yet I can't understand why they insist on wearing you down with, at least on this recording, 20 minutes of pure filler. Corigan's ego gets in the way of just letting this superb band play. The Pumpkins are in a slow decline; they peaked with Simaese Dream eight years ago and Adore and Machina are arguably their weakest efforts. I wouldn't be so harsh if I didn't believe that this is simply not as good as this band is capable of delivering."
5,Sad to see how old Pumpkins fans don't get it sometimes,"This album is not necessarily a return to rock, but is still one of the 20 greatest CD's ever as is every Pumpkins CD ever put out. This is a sad album in that it reflects the emptiness that rock music currently holds in its 'punk' quality. If you turn on the radio today, chances are, you'll here something that is not very intelligent and definitely not a beautiful piece of music. One of the things that attracts me to the Pumpkins is the incredible sense of beauty and meaningfulness in their music. While Machina is full of georgeous music, the rock songs are meaningless and sad because they are perhaps the goodbye songs of the Pumpkins. Hence, I think that the harder songs on Machina should not be criticized since they reflect the intelligence of Corgan."
3,Less than perfect,"I bought this CD in anticipation of more great music from one of my favorite bands. What I got was definitely SP, but the distortion and other effects seem to detract from the cleaner sound of older material. It seemed like they were trying too hard to appeal to rock-only fans that rejected Adore (a good album in my opinion)."
4,What a surprise!,"This is an incredible cd! I purchased this cd because of the single"" Stand inside yourself"". I thought this would be like all of the other SP CD's. I was wrong! I have had this cd for three days and I can not stop listening to it. It is very melodic and is completely diffrent that any of there other ones. The music is great and the singing is incredible.The only complaint that I have is that it should of been produced diffrent. It is very melodic but, you lose some of that because of the excessive noise in the songs. One of the best Cd's I have heard this year. I would recomend picking it up today!"
4,Un disco Maduro,"En este disco Billy Corgan y Compañia, llevan el sonido de los smashing pumpkins a un punto de equlibrio entre los sonidos estridentes de los primeros discos al sonido elaborado de Adore y parte del mellon collie and the infinite sadness, el sonido es muy bueno, un buen disco de Rock-pop, con el sonido fuerte cuando debe estar y el sonido calmado donde debe estar, canciones bellas, una bateria muy buena (se nota que jimmy esta de vuelta), un gran disco de una banda que no deja de sorprenderme"
2,"Not up to expectations, sadly...","I had high hopes for this album after the first single, ""Stand Inside Your Love"", which encapsulates everything that the Pumpkins do best. Unfortunately, the single proved to be an exception. Which is not to say that the album is terrible - those fans who appreciate the heavier moments of previous Pumpkins albums will probably find much to their satisfaction here. If, however, you are buying it with hopes that there is anything with the majestic beauty of ""Tonight Tonight"" or ""Thirty Three"", don't waste your money - instead, buy the single. The artwork is amazing, but unfortunately the album is overlong, bloated and ultimately unnecessary. A great shame and a wasted opportunity, alas..."
4,Not For Headbangers,"When I heard ""The Everlasting Gaze"" on the radio it rocked my world. When I got this cd i was disapointed that it was the only good headbanging song on this cd. There are a few good slower ones but I just wish they made more fast ones."
4,A Great Album,"I think the above review is unfair and innappropriate. Smashing Pumpkins made it big with 'Siamese Dreams' and 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'. Unfortunatly, after those 2 albums, the general population thinks they'll release something similar. And as we all know, people change and people fluxuate. If you enjoy a heavy metal sound AND you like Smashing Pumpkins, I'd suggest this album. For hardcore SP fans (like myself), this album is just another change in feeling and mood of SP."
3,more of the same,"unlike all the other reviewers, i liked adore, it was a step in a different direction. Machina, well, it is a step back. From what i have listened so far it seems to be like a rehash of mellon collie. a band has to change or it gets passed by (See Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam). the pumpkins earlier work is amazing, but they should not try to release the same music over and over again."
2,"A few good songs, a lot of boring songs","This album feels a bit like Billy Corgan is running out of melodic ideas. For all that Adore was criticized, Machina has no songs that are as instantly catchy as Perfect or Appels & Oranges. There are a few good songs, like Try Try Try, Raindrops & Sunshowers, and Age of Innocence, but on balance, the album is pretty melodically minimalistic and boring -- in stark contrast to some of the great stuff out there now, like Moby, Beck, or Radiohead. Unfortunately, the album mostly sounds like pale, uninteresting imitations of previous great Pumpkins efforts."
4,Solid,"After Adore the Pumpkins had nowhere to go but up. Luckily they came up with a real good record. Two songs that stick out are Heavy Metal Machine and Everlasting Gaze, they rock. The opening riff from Everlasting Gaze is a great way to start off an album, pure energy."
5,Their best,"I have never been a Smashing Pumpkins fan, but when I listened to that CD, I began to think differently. I don't know why tough. Maybe it's the atmosphere of the album, or their new sound... All the songs are so appealing. Anyway, I love this CD.I must admit that I have a terrible crush on Melissa Auf Der Maur, but the album's great too... well almost as great as she is."
5,The Smashing Pumpkins are fully polished.,"True musicians. They bring me inspiration on life. This album is amazing. Poetic, in fact. Just take a moment to look at the progression they have made. They have learned so much musically. Truly moving."
4,Very strong songwriting thoughout,"Its disappointing that most of the reviews I have seen of this album, especially published ones, review more the band and how this CD fits into their history than simply judging the music. I guess that's the hazard of trying to follow previous success. In my opinion this CD contains the largest number of great songs of any Smashing Pumpkins albums. While there is no single track quite as good as ""1979"" or ""Today"", there are, by my count, 8 tracks that are almost on that level, which makes for a much more consistant album than any of the band's previous work. Standouts include ""Stand Inside Your Love"", ""Raindrops and Sunshowers"", ""Try, Try, Try"", and ""This Time"". I also really like ""I Of The Mourning"", ""The Sacred and Profane"", ""Wound"", and ""With Every Light""."
5,Why the [Heck] Wont Anyone Buy This CD,"The Smashing Pumpkins have done it again and nobody knows about it.After hearing the Pumpkins previous albums I was blown away by the fact that this was the only band around that was not afraid to do something truly unique and different and this album just confirms my belief.The album seems to just speak to its listeners and it has an accurate message on how people actually feel,not how society thinks they should feel. Sadly people would rather listen to [stuff] like Nsync and The Backstreet boys whose songs are basically just the same [stuff] recycled every 2 years. The songs on MACHINA are amongst Corgans best ,and I think that ""I of the Mourning"" is the best SP song ever.But if everyone wants to listen to the same old [stuff] go ahead and let them but if you want a great CD then go out and buy MACHINA you will not be disapointed."
4,"Good, not great","The Pumpkins come back to much more weary '95 sound with Machina. ""Everlasting Gaze"", ""Stand Inside Your Love"", ""I of the Morning"" and ""Heavy Metal Machine"" are the best of this album. After ""Heavy..."" the album starts to lag but the first few songs are worth a buy anyways. There arent any hidden gems on this album like, say, the last few songs on ""Siamese Dream"". But like I said its still better than any other Major label stuff out there now. It good to see the Pumpkins back when rock needs them the most, in this day of teenybopper pop, and aggro."
2,A Sad Day,"I love the Smashing Pumpkins, I love every album up to and including Adore (which I personally thought was incredible), but I cannot stand Machina. It sounds as if Billy, who I have always touted as a true modern poet, is attempting to copy his own style, randomly mashing together succesful bits of other songs in an attempt to relive past glory. The result is a collection of songs that sounds confused, unsure, and unoriginal. Adore represented a step forward, a breakthrough in Billy's artistry, but this album disappoints by attempting to recreate the angsty, hardcore sound of the earlier albums to achieve greater commercial success. Listen to Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie, or Adore, and be amazed by the beautiful progression of an artist, but skip this album, and wait for the next, which will hopefully place the Pumpkins back on track and back at the top, where they belong."
5,A Machine of beauty,"Although Adore is a very good album, I was insisting as a fan that the next album would be more a return to the Pumpkins' signiture sound. And although I would have liked a couple more faster songs, the end product overwhelms that desire. Most songs are not slow like Adore's slow songs, but more mid-tempo. Subtle melodies here are perfect for Billy's voice - his voice drones as if it was in the background, and it creates a mesmerizing effect. There are many highlights, but I'll mention a couple - I found ""Sacred And The Profane"" to have one of the neatest string effects that I have ever heard, and the closing song ""Age Of Innocence"" sounds like a folk-rock epic. Non-corporate but still not foreign, the Pumpkins and this album are a cut above."
4,The Return of the Smashing Pumpkins,"The Smashing Pumpkins have always been one of my favorite bands. When I heard ""The Everlasting Gaze"" on the radio a few months ago I could not wait for this album to come out. I have been listening to it for about a week straight now and I haven't been all that impressed, but there are some excellent songs here. ""Stand Inside Your Love"" may be the standout track on the album, but my darkhorse favorite is ""Glass and the Ghost Children."" Its just a realy unique song. I also love ""Heavy Metal Machine,"" it just really rocks and hope I get a chance to hear it live. For the most part this album is just a progression from their last ""Adore,"" but their are a lot of new things that the Pumpkins throw in the mix. I think it is their most creative work to date and anyone who likes the Smashing Pumpkins should be listening to this album."
2,"Billy, what the blazes have you done to the Pumpkins!","The return of the addict drummer helps spring them back from their last tragedy (Adore), but not far enough. I like electronica, but I've never liked what the Pumpkins have done with it. I'd rather Underworld and FatBoy handled the synthesizers. Billy, D'arcy and James belong on guitars. Next time, OK?"
2,The Great Pumpkin Never Did Come,"I have yet to sit through the entire CD. Billy's voice reminds me too much of Cartman from Southpark. And he looks an awful lot like Pinhead in the Everlasting Gaze video. Some artists improve with age and some worsen. The Pumpkin heads have been rolling downhill for sometime. Do something else with your hard earned money, like invest it."
3,good idea but sadly wrong,"Well I have listened to the album for a million times.All I can say is that it is a unique album.The everlasting gaze is a good start to the album.The second song has got good drums but it is a weak song. Next one Stand inside your love is one of the best pumpkin songs.Next two are solid.Number six on the album Try Try Try is the worst video single of there career. Heavy Metal Machine is one of the rear bright points of the album.This time is a average song.From this point the album gets worths and worths.The last two song are solid.I must compilmant the cover and CD design.I advise you to download MAchnina II for free, cause it is much better.Ok that is it for me.ROCK ON"
2,Boring,"With everyone saying that Machina marked a return to good ol' rock and roll for the Pumpkins, I couldn't wait to go and get this cd. Unfortunately, I was hugely dissapointed. There are only three or four tracks out of fifteen that truly rock and that's including the two singles. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy slower soothing music but nothing on this album is soothing. All of the slower songs are just full of electronic nonsense or boring, repetitive riffs. There is no musical exploration like on SP efforts before Adore. Most of the tracks are 4-6 minute long torture sessions. My last complaint is that Machina drags on way too long and lacks diversity. There a few good songs such as ""The Everlasting Gaze"", ""Stand Inside Your Love"", ""Heavy Metal Machine"", and ""The Imploding Voice"", but overall this is a pile of pretentious musical sawdust. If you enjoyed Gish, Siamese Dream, or Pisces Iscariot, do not waste your cash on Machina/Machines of God."
2,Great album bad mix,"Great Album, great songs, the only bad thing isthat it's mixed by yet another deaf soundtechnician"
2,Want good electronica? This isn't it. Go buy DM instead,"Machina sounds like a second-rate Depeche Mode album that The Pumpkins stole and dubbed Billy Corgan's voice over. The Pumpkins even stole Depeche Mode's producer, so go figure. The Pumpkins were excellent in their heyday, but everything after Mellon Collie didn't have the vibe that made the Pumpkins special. If you want an album that is dark, brooding, and does electronica the way it should be done, then get Depeche Mode's Ultra album. If you want an album that does alternative the way it should be done, then get the Pumpkins' Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie albums."
3,Eh...,"MACHINA is spotty at best. Upon first listen I was like ""This is cool! It's like The Pumpkins on soft-rock radio""! But not too long into my love affair, I realized that MACHINA is actually just kind of crappy. Crappy, corny way way over-produced sound, insipid lyrics and embarrassing self-references all combine to make a not so smashing album. ""The Everlasting Gaze"" may sound good at first, but it gets annoying and intrusive upon multiple listens. Download ""Try, Try, Try"" ""The Imploding Voice"" ""Wound"" ""This Time"" ""Glass and the Ghost Children"" and ""Age of Innocence"" and leave the rest to the discount bin. It's sad but true.If you're looking for an extremely awesome Pumpkins experience, definitely obtain Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Siamese Dream is all right as well. And Gish is pretty cool."
2,To all the 5 star reviews...,"I don't know what the big deal is. This album is exactly the same as all the rest of them; only one or two songs rock and the rest put you to sleep. This album isn't redefining rock, showing a new twist, and certainly not receiving 5 stars. The Pumkins need to give us what we expect from each album we will purchase anyway."
2,Consciously confined,"2 1/2Most know already going in that after Mellon Collie albums essentially became techno-tinged Corgan projects, but don't let disgruntled fans convince you this is anything less than competent, if bloated."
1,A work of genius,"Thank you Smashing Pumpkins for all the great music you've given us over the years. This is your swan song and now you've gone, but I'm pretty sure Billy will continue to open the beautiful kaleidoscope of his tortured soul as he does so passionately on this phenomenal record. I like all the tracks, but my favorite is the 3rd one."
3,NOT A GOOD END OF PUMPKINS' CAREER,"most peoplp are glad for their come back on this MACHINA,but i guess ADORE is far more better than it,as billy himself said he wanted people to tell him ADORE is the best. the only song which can stir my heart is [GLASS & GHOST CHILDREN]. i suggest u to check out SIAMESE DREAM,pumpkins' best is u're want the best out of them"
2,"Buy ""Adore"" instead.","It is quite possible that MACHINA is the worst album by a good band I have ever heard. It is Billy Corgan at his most pretentious, and the guitars all sound as if they are being played in the same studio where a lawn is being mowed. The only reason I gave this CD 2 stars instead of 1 is the triumphant return of Jimmy Chamberlain. His drumming is, as always, fantastic. However, the CD as a whole is really quite mediocre, and it's a shame this will be their final album. Let's hope ""Adore"" is forever remebered as their last album, and MACHINA is looked upon as the enigma that it is."
3,The Machine is beginning to leak oil.......,"Machina has a great deal to recommend it as an album. Solid lyrics, a human being (Chamberlain) back on drums, and a tight sound give the album a good measure of power. The final song on the album is one of the best Pumpkins tunes to date and gives hope that the evolution of the band will continue in an always interesting fashion. Still, there is much missing from this album. Adore, while lambasted by many, represented a sincere effort at something different with surprisingly good results - Ava Adore is probably a better straight rocker than anything on Machina - but it couldn't stand up to the Pumpkins' past. We're all waiting for the next Siamese Dream or Gish......but that's not gonna happen. Better to relish the first four CD's by the band (including P. Iscariot) and keep an interested eye on the future. As the line goes ""As you might have guessed we won't make it home"" - a good effort for a BAND still seeking a new identity."
5,the aeroplane continues to soar,atmospheric yet still rocks yet still makes you want to dance. this is the smashing pumpkins. to really appreciate the songs on this record one must hear them live. check out ARISING tour bootleg or christmas chicago shows on 12/21-22/99.
4,A very different yet intriguing album,"I'm a big Pumpkins fan. ""Cherub Rock"", ""Today"", ""1979"", and ""Tonight, Tonight"" are all among my favorite songs. The Smashing Pumpkins are definitely an original and unique band, and that's one of the things I like about them. On Machina, the Pumpkins, more than ever before, show their willingness to divert from traditional rock. Machina, though it may not be as enjoyable as previous Pumpkins' albums, is an interesting listen. The grinding hard rock of ""The Everlasting Gaze"", the moving ""Stand Inside Your Love"", and the gentle soft rock of ""Try, Try, Try"" make for three very good individual songs. But the main feature of Machina is how the songs seem to flow together, especially towards the end, as if they are all acts of one big play. Though the album (which is pretty long) starts to drag towards the end, it is still a rare piece of alternative rock art."
3,Things Fall Apart,"Machina was recorded as the Smashing Pumpkins were in the long process of breaking up, and it shows on their final studio album. Despite great tracks like ""The Everlasting Gaze"", ""Stand Inside Your Love"", ""Try Try Try"", and my favorite ""The Age of Innocence"", fifty of the seventy minutes of this album are filler. I suggest their free internet download double album ""Machina 2: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music"" over this one."
4,BILLY IS BACK WITH A CORKER,"Machina is what the world has been crying out for. like spring is to the year, machina brings a fresh wave of rock that has been lacking for a while. hard hitting tunes such as heavy metal machines and everlasing gaze are vintage corgan and melodies such as stand inside and try try try are sung from the heart. somewhat dispondant towards the end but nothing is perfect. a must have for die hard fans and others alike"
4,RO&Eug slot players,This video has a variety of video poker machines. It is a lot of fun to play and the payoffs are very similar to AC as well as Vegas. We are spending time playing these games even though I do not always agree with what they tell us to do. Fun for Video Poker enthusiasts.
4,Gems among the rocks,"I bought this record sight-unseen (or heard) based on what was written by people I don't even know. I have to do more of this. Gilt-Flake is a wonderful, indy-sounding work that will make you laugh out loud for its wittiness, and will make you (almost) cry the way looking at old yearbooks does; the message is carried home by the tuneful, jangly vehicle of Anglo pop. Every song is good, some are great, and at least one is an untouchable masterpiece.If you like Jellyfish, Cotton Mather, and the Rhino Poptopia series, just buy this CD. You'll be glad you took my word for it."
4,She's Looking Out A Window,"If anything buy the cd for the last song, ""She Looking Out A Window."" I don't know how to put this into words, but this has got to be one of the best songs written in the last 15 years, and sadly enough it sits in obscurity. The rest of the album which consists of demos, is very listenable. But the prize in the ceral box is ""She's Looking Out A Window."" A song that encapsulates longing and regret so well it should be used as the definition in any dictionary in any language. Who hasn't looked back at old photographs when a relationship seemed invincible, only to have it crumble before their eyes? You have that moment forever, frozen in time, but you can't touch it, you can't feel it, you can only remember the smell of their hair, they way they looked when they slept next to you, the way they laughed, and how they cried. This song hits on all those emotions. Truly an amazing piece of music."
5,An Overlooked Masterpiece...,"In my many years as a musician, few people have moved me as Mr. Jones has. I've had the privilege of playing alongside the man several times and yes, I played drums on this very CD. Being his first real foray into the realm of music and production, I can see where some people might slag this one a bit. In fact, some of his more memorable songs (to me, at least) don't appear here. But the power and passion of his melodies and lyrics are all too apparent here. The Blunderbuss and Goodbye still slay me to this day with their clever lyrics and great guitar riffs. Anyone who had the chance to catch his earlier band The Dig Mandrakes will recognize the signature harmony guitar solos that band was renown for. But to me, the wonderful sentiment and passionate musicianship is what pulls me to this CD again and again. I'm still waiting for Brad to call me up to work on the sequel to this album. I guess he'll start on it when he's good and ready!"
2,I'm Frankly Lamer,"I can't say on other portions of Frank's life, but with respect to the Bonnie and Clyde material this book is full of inaccuracies. The authors make the dire mistake of reprinting contemporary newspaper accounts as fact. For example, Bonnie had nothing to do with the grapevine killings, but this book states she kicked one officer over and shot him in the head, as was misreported at the time.Other items also make one wonder if they know what they are talking about -- the book identifies a very clear picture of W.D. Jones as Clyde Barrow! This is unforgivable and makes everything else in the book highly suspect. This book might make a good drink coaster but it's a little large."
5,Edifying and Instructive,"Since Wesley wrote in a different era, his style requires some adjustment but once one gets past that there is a lot of edifying content in this book. The key point of this book is the issue of ""perfection."" He sees it as living what Jesus said was the greatest commandment and its accompanying commandment, i.e., to love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your mind, all your strength, and to love your neighbor as you love yourself. Wesley's life demonstrates that he reached the goal. He traveled extensively, read widely, wrote inspiringly, and influenced many people to believe in Jesus as their Savior. Thank God for his legacy in words and deeds. He truly practiced and preached."
1,spend the extra $0.50,Apparently there was no editing done on this edition. Spend the extra $0.50 and get the other Kindle version that has been combed over to ensure accuracy.
4,an important and necessary book for the manager or supervisor,"This book by Kenneth Sovereign is a very readable book on personnel or Human Resource Management law.The Human Resource Manager, manager, supervisor or others conderned with managing and supervising people should have a book such as this at their fingertips. It is a necessary part of being a real manager or supervisor.A good read for those in business.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,Hodgepodge of mismatched topics,"Sovereign seems to skip around often in a half-hearted effort at being comprehensive. The cases are not very recent, despite the publication date, and the book has a definite lack of flow. It is almost as if the author threw together several mismatched segments and forgot to edit it for comprehension and cohesiveness."
5,Hours of playtime fun,"We bought this dollhouse at a local toy store for my daugher's 4th birthday. I really like the frame style and the way the children can reach in from all angles. It is much more durable than allowing her to play with my ""look pretty"" dollhouses. I did not buy any of the furniture sets designed for it. I bought the two complete sets of IKEA dollhouse furniture and they fit perfectly and filled the rooms. That cost me about $28 total. Instead of people, my daughter uses the Calico Critters animals that used to be called Sylvanian Family. She loves it."
5,Ryan's Room Review,"This is an excellent, well built toy. It was easy to put together and directions were easy to follow. Glad that I got it and would recommend to others."
5,Very pleased with purchase...product exceeded expectations!,"This is a good quality dollhouse. Our granddaughter loved it and it is so durable. Lots of imaginable play ahead. Thank you, Tom's Toys for such great service and packaging!"
4,A Lot of Beautiful Music for Little Money!,"This two disc set is an incredible bargain, considering it contains more than two hours worth of wonderful chamber music by Mozart expertly performed by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. The first disc features the famous Gran Partita, and also a short but charming rondo for horn. The second disc has a couple of neglected but very intriguing serenades for wind instruments composed by Mozart during his first years in Vienna. The rich and somber tones of serenade no. 12 are particularly memorable. The sound quality of these cds is first-rate. The extensive liner notes provide listeners with an understanding of the compositions and the historical context in which they were created. A welcome addition to any Mozart collection."
5,A great way to spend some spare time,"This book is a great way to keep the people around you wondering whats going on in your head, for the rest of the day. Inside are great ways to keep your roommate, boss, co-workers, and even people you don't know, wondering/worrying about you for the rest of the day. Mabye even longer than that. For example: Cook only one meal in the presence of your roommate: Lime in a toaster. Ask people at the gym for a good forehead exercise. These are just a few of the many great ways the screw with peoples heads that you will find in this book. It is deffinitly worth the money and timeto read it."
5,So funny I got heartburn,This is really funny. I was reading it lying down and realized how hard I was laughing when I unintentionally coughed up some bile. Keep up the great stuff!
1,A bunch of stoners trying to make a buck!,Stupid! I don't know how I got suckered into this. I thought it might be fun for my ESL class but I'd be too embarrased to read or more or less show it to anyone!
4,Dtv on your laptop,Good picture quality with a small antenna; it gives sharp images and the record functions great too. I always have to Reposition the antenna though. So I decided to use this tuner with basic cable tv. Its really nice because shows refer to websites; you can visit theses sites on your laptop as your watching the show. Very interactive watching!
3,OK for the money,"The hardware seems to work fine, its the software that isn't all it could be. I'm still using it, but periodically the software will crash my computer while changing channels. its bothersome, I paid 30.00 for it and I think I should have coughed up a little more for one that has better software (if it exists)or maybe find some 3rd party software or something. in summery, I'm not that disappointed considering the price, but I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend."
4,wowo5,The only channel I can't receive is 55 (FOX) as the scan only goes to 50 this is more than certain the cause of not receiving 55. CanAvertvhd Volar (A868R) provide a download to correct this problem?
5,This book is fiction,"This book is poorly written,edited, and at time reads worse than an R.L. Stine Goosbumps novel.I feel sorry for people who buy into these ghost stories without doing any research.The Pearl Bryan legend is just that, a legend. I am researching the subject as a history major at the University of Cincinnati. There is absolutely no primary documentation or evidence in general to support the satanic cult theory suggested by Hensley. None. In fact, every website that posts the Pearl Bryan murder legend fails to accept the simple historical facts. People just can't seem to accept that the two mile proximity of the murder to what is now Bobby Mackey's is just a coincedence.GET OVER IT!"
2,Don't buy this book...,"Don't waste your time on this book. This book reads like something written by a high school student who didn't do very well in English. The author uses way too may adjectives, and the story gets lost in poor writing and sensationalism. I might add that the pictures in the book are absolutely terrible. It looks like this book was home published. Don't buy it!!!!"
