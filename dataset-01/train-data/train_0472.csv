1,Won't Work for Centurylink (at least for me!),I read previous reviews and decided to purchase modem to replace Centurylink modem/router I am renting. Could not get this modem to work. Called tech support twice and could not understand the technician because they don't speak English!!!
1,Defective,"After spending hours on the phone with both D-Link and my internet provider, we concluded that the device was defective. It did not work at all, and I ended up returning it. I have no idea if this is common with this product or if it was just a fluke. Also, the D-Link customer support was not helpful -- they assumed that any problems were because of my internet provider and did not work hard to help me solve the problem. I did get a prompt refund, though."
3,We've heard it all before ... and it's a CDR not a CD ... with a paper label,"This is a very pleasant album, but as a collector with hundreds of Beatles cover albums, I would say it brings nothing new to the genre except a clever title. And I was extremely disappointed to find out that it was a CDR not a CD, with a glued on paper label to boot. Who knows if it will even be playable in 10 years?! CDR sellers ought to at least warn potential buyers that it's not a pressed CD ... which is really what it was advertised as. And how expensive is it to print on CDRs directly these days anyway?"
4,Cali LOve,"I think this album was good. I didn't like everytrack, but the majority was good. My favorite songs are ""I'm so tierd of you doing me wrong,"" and ""PineY Point trail."" Beau Jocque (Andrus Espree) was an exceptional accordion player, and he will be missed. From the BOSSHOG BABY! (L-TOWN LOVE) while i'm here i might as well give a shout out to my people who might see this. All my aunties and uncles in Lake Charles and surrounding areas and to My boy ALOICIOUS in tyrone. Saving the best for last to my girl SAAB who is moving to Lake Charles this summer I""MMA miss you. I'll holla!"
4,Mammouth indeed !,"Very lengthy (like the title claims : ""mammouth"") book devoted to the prophecies of Nostrdamus and many others. Recommended for fans of this genre of literature. Reads easily and holds interest. Well constructed."
5,side-splitting,"Have you ever had a laughing fit while reading on a bus? It was almost enough to have me committed.Although not personally aware of any Irish in my blood, the way this erupted in me makes it a strong chance.It has never been better explained why so many Irish ended up in America and elsewhere abroad. A true story!"
1,hated it,"I didn't like this book at all. I read it for english class. Whenever I picked it up, I fell asleep. It was so boring. I guess it would have been OK if it was more inleresting to read."
3,Reality TV with a Splash of Da Vinci,"It's a fun Discovery Channel show, but don't expect Mythbusters. This is first and foremost presented as Reality TV. The focus of the show isn't on the cool contraption the guys are building - it's about the people themselves and how they interact while building each machine. Do not go into this show expecting a documentary or something like Mythbusters - you'll be disappointed. With that said, this isn't a bad show. If you like Da Vinci (or just medieval machinery) and don't loath reality TV, you'll enjoy this short-lived TV series."
3,Great starter book,"This book was really helpful when I was first getting up to speed on Embedded Visual Basic development. The chapter discussing what could be done in VB but not in EVB was very useful. The samples in the book are useful.Once you have a good grasp of EVB though this book seems to be lacking the more advanced issues you'll run into. It doesn't cover near enough of the API calls and how to use them in EVB. It doesn't talk about building an install. It doesn't discuss the remote API. It doesn't discuss tricks on how to get your application working across different platforms.If you're getting started check this book out, if you've been programming for awhile and need a good reference book on all topics look elsewhere."
4,Another recording with substance from Greater Vision,"If Greater Vision is not the premier trio in southern gospel music then they should be. ""Far Beyond This Place"" is filled with substance, class, tight harmony and passion; all of which make Greater Vision a force to be reckoned with in gospel music. If you have never heard Greater Vision before this would be a great place to start."
5,UNBEATABLE!,"GREATER VISION HAS HIT THE MARK! ""My Name Is Lazarus"" is AWESOME! YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR SEAT! They have great harmony & exalt Christ! I also loved ""Just One More Soul"" & ""He Left It All!"" Jason is a GREAT singer! Their voices blend beautifully-thank God for talented Christian men who devote their life to sing for Christ! EVERYONE NEEDS THIS PROJECT!"
5,excellant book by an honest authority,This is a very good and informative book by an honest man with knowledge about the subject that he writes about. Somewhat long in tooth. I wish more from this author would be forthcoming.
5,Just wanna be your friend!!,"I think that this CD is pretty good but the best song on here is #5 (I just wanna be your friend). If you like the band THIRD EYE BLIND, then you will like this song because lead singer from 3eb, Stephan Jenkins is the singer on track #5. This was when he had his old band ""Puck and Natty""."
5,Buy this for the theme song.,"I bought this soundtrack and set it as my alarm clock. So every morning when I wake up at 7:15 a.m. I hear "" duh nuh nuh nuh, duh nuh nuh nuh!!! CLAP!! CLAP!!"" and then I do a ninja flip out of the bed into my slippers and pick up my autographed red and yellow hulk hogan guitar (custom made) and bust into a 3 minute long solo. It's become such a spectacle in my neighborhood that the children at the school bus gather around my front lawn and look into my window to witness such a display musicianship. When I'm done I yell at them to get off my lawn or I'll run them over with my 88 Le Sabre, life is sweet."
1,Not for an experienced dancer,"I found Rania's hip moves excellent, but she has stupid arms that just flop around. Not very professional at all."
3,Early Chuck Norris Film Sends The Bad Guys Down With A Roundhouse Kick,"Length:: 1:18 MinsBreaker, Breaker"
3,Good for a Laugh,"Chuck Norris's brother is hauling freight through a small Texas Town when the local sherif arrests him on a trumped up charge. The town confiscates the load, kidnaps his brother, and puts him in jail.This causes chuck to go into the town and start opening a king sized can of whoop but. Bad acting, good fight seens, and a poor story line all combine for a pretty good movie. I'd buy this movie just to laugh at the out of date 1960-1970 fasions.Rich"
5,they don't make B-movie action films like this any more,"and it's a shame, these days most direct to video b-movies are not all that great, but back then, they were fun, sure the acting and story are not the best, but it's fun, and really that's what you come for right? fun, good action with some funny scenes in there.the action may not seem like much next to the jackie chan movies or the post-matrix world and that's a shame, Chucks action always seemed more real, down and dirty, his hits meant something, when he does his big kicks, you know that hurt.the movie held up better than i thought it would, i saw it again for the first time in years just minutes ago, it has some 70's styles and look, but really it's more of a timeless western feel they have going on, chuck is the stanger coem to clean up ""texas city"" and save his brother, he faces down the locals, has a great fight or 20, gets the girl and walks off into the sunset."
3,"A Dated, But Okay Effort For Norris' First Starring Role","During the CB (Citizen Band) radio craze of the 70's, Chuck Norris began his very successful leading man career by appearing in this film.Norris plays a trucker whose brother gets caught up in a speed-trap town whose leaders don't mind killing to maintain control. Of course, truckers unite by using the CB radios, Norris kicks lots of butt, and a good reckneck time is had by all.The CB focus, fashions and trends are very dated, and the movie isn't good enough to overcome these limitations. But it works as a cheap action flick and curio timepiece. Breaker, Breaker is far from Norris' best, but he has also done much, much worse."
5,chuck norris = breaker breaker,I am achuck Norris fan and trying to get his movies on DVD - Found some hard to get movies here - great service and quick delivery on all items
3,Bought as a gift,"I purchased this as a gift for a family member, since she loves the Chuck Norris. Not complaints from her about it."
2,Vector 1 million cp light,This light is rated at 1 Million/cp. When I used it along with an older version Victor 1 Million/cp light:It was only about half as effectiveHad a much shorter battery life before requiring re-chargeTook longer to re-charge
2,Not good,"Light has very little battery life. Even after following the instructions of first charge and fully hcarging it before every use, the max run time of the battery is no more than 20 minutes. Certainly it will last longer if you use it periodically but for us, we use it on our boat and it was truly a waste of money. Spotlight is not on for more than 10 seconds at a time because we just use it to see the navigational markers at night and even then we cant use it for more than one hour. Very comfortable grip but does not good to be comfortable if you cant use it. Would never buy this again."
1,Bad Customer Service,"I ordered this product Monday night and I requested a cancellation 7 AM the next day and they refused it saying it was already too late. Now, I have to wait for it to come then return it and they are deducting a $7 shipping fee for the return. To say I am furious at the way this company handles their business is a huge understatement."
3,book,"Item was delivered in a timely manner.When I ordered, I didn't see there was a black ink mark on the books pages at bottom in the description. Oh well."
3,things i want my daughters to know,"The book really wasnt what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting more of a ""life lessons"". It was an easy read however"
5,Great book-must read for mothers,"I read this book in a matter of days. I'll definitely be giving this to my daughters to read when they are old enough. Wonderfully written, full of amazing advice."
4,Four Stars,"I purchased this HDTV about four months ago. Everyone in my household loves it, and so do I. I like the fact that I could still watch movies and other shows while my husband can watch football games at the same time. Before we always fought over who would be able to watch television, and of course he would always win. Another feature that I love is that it has a front panel lock so my one and a half year old child can't turn it on and off and play with the menu. I like all the features it has except that you have to sit almost in front of the t.v. to see the picture on the screen. It is kind of hard to see the picture from where my computer sits, so it's either one or the other."
1,"Nice Pictures, Awful Writing",This book has beautiful pictures from the CDT but I found the text almost unreadable. Mr. Fayhee's prose is both hyperbolic and facetious. He also can't get his tenses to agree. He acknowledges this particular failing; unfortunately the editor seems not to have restrained any of these bad tendencies.
1,Too much trouble,"I look for games to play at family get togethers and simple dinner parties. After reviewing all of the games in the book, I found only one that I could use. The others require too much preparation. For instance, ""Mad Advertising"" has you record 20 commercial from the TV and find an obscure question to ask about the commercial. When the game begins, you show the commercial and ask the question, and see who gets the most correct answers. That's too much time and trouble, and not that fun."
5,We're regularly in the prize line-up since reading this book,"I compete at a novice level in eventing, and ride in dressage and jumping events in the off-season - but never very succesfully. However, since reading this book, and trying to apply Ms Savoie's principles, my horse and I almost always find ourselves lining up to collect prizes. Although this book explains the basic principles of riding in a readable and simple style, Ms Savoie provides as comprehensive an introduction to the subject as I've seen anywhere. The illustrations are pertinent, and contribute significantly to understanding the text. Often, when I am struggling with a problem with my horse, I go back to this book for assistance - and invariably there is something that helps. I've recently bought Ms Savoie's sequel to this book, such is the confidence that I now have in her writing!"
5,review,I'am a beginner to riding and this book was such a great help.It not only taught me simple dressage but helped me with my everyday riding
3,Very Good,"I'm glad I bought this book - it was really helpful. I've used some of the visualization techniques in my own riding, with very positive results - my horse and I are both a lot more relaxed. Jane Savoie writes in an entertaining way and demystifies dressage, showing that the principles are important to all types of equitation. She explains things very thoroughly, and keeps the fun in riding - doesn't take herself or dressage TOO seriously. She explains that with the right basics in place, any horse and rider can do basic dressage. My only complaint about this book is that the cartoon illustrations in the margins were not very professionally done. They looked like they were drawn by a 10-year-old, which was rather annoying - but they still got the point across, and the book itself is so good that it didn't matter. This one was worth the money, and I'd certainly not hestitate to buy another book by this author. Recommended!"
4,essential reading,"This may be the best ""how-to"" books on riding I've read. The description of the rider's experience when things work, and when they don't, are true to my experience. And the key points at the end of each section sum things up nicely. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
5,Most helpful horse book I have ever owned,"I must have 40 books for training my young horse. Most have been a waste of money, at best, provide a little help. But this book is loaded from cover to cover with easy to understand and a very informative approach to increasing skills. It has become my bible for improvement. Thanks Jane Savoie"
5,"Finally, easy to follow instructions and a reason for them","I spent much of my life as a cowgirl. Back then, no one considered dressage for basic training. Now that I am learning dressage, I needed someone to visually explain the maneuvers and the reason for how to execute them. This ol' cowgirl needed plain basic instructions and this book is the only one I consider easy to understand. That's a mouthful when it comes to dressage, but the book delivers. Within a year, we are working on 3 rd level, and I have much to thank the book that backs up what my trainer tries to explain.the author of:Roses and Locoweed: The Life of a Cowboy's WifeandThe Winter Years of World War II"
4,Useful Idea..,"Been a technical trader for some years. Having abandoned all indicators for their obvious lagging limitations, I was pleasantly surprised to find some value in ""Value Carts"" as a tool. It is not the holy grail. There is none in case you're wondering. But together with an intelligent method, healthy psychology, and capital protective plan, it can be a useful component.As to the video itself, it is decently produced from a live workshop he did. Stendahl is quite the ""systems maven"". He goes beyond just explaining Value Charts in the video, going to considerable lengths to outline the framework of a viable system. His is a Tradestation background, and so backtesting and all it's potential strengths and weaknesses are part of his approach. Not a criticism, just a note that he's geared towards mechanical approaches, not discretionary ones."
3,Read it one day - though I didn't have insomnia,"This was an ok book. This appears to be written after the movie (as opposed to a lot of novels that are made into movies). How is this significant? Well, b/c a lot of times movies have to cut things out of books to fit into a two hour movie. In this case, though, the book reads like a movie. The good thing with that is that it was a quick read (I read it one day). The bad thing is that it never really expanded on any of the ideas. I never saw this movie and I bought for ten cents, so I would say I got my money's worth. But this is not something I would recommend. Will Dormer was not a very likeable character in the book and the author (which probably goes along with the movie) never gives us any ""suspects"" throughout the book or any real motivation for the crime. We get only a glimpse into what happened. But the book is pretty straightforward and if you like quick reads, go ahead and read. Or maybe just go see the movie instead."
1,Another stolen idea! :-(,"I really wonder if American moviemakers and authors [borrow] so much European ideas just to make money??? I never read or saw an American ""remake"" that even came close to the original...Is there NO possibility to rate it with zero stars?"
5,Amazing Guidance,"These cards transform your life if you work with them. They are ancient, yet the images and words are galactic, modern and speak deeply to your soul. I own lots of oracles and tarot decks that I love, but these teach you the deeper lessons we need in this time of Gaia's change."
4,"Delightful cards, really good book",I started reading this book as soon as I received the package and didn't put it down until I had read the whole thing. This has been a useful book and I enjoy the cards very much - not as much science as other books on the subject but definitely an asset to my collection.
3,loose weight rapidly,The predigested protein has proven as a quick way to loose lbs. However one must be careful to check with his Dr.
5,SUE`O HECHO REALIDAD,"Lo que habiamos escuchado, cantado, recitado... muchas veces sin poder hacerlo a viva voz y con un sistema de represion gigantesco.Ese dia de Marzo se hizo realidad en ese estadio nacional que habia sido testigo de prisioneros 17 años antes y que ese dia un hombre le cantaba al amor,un poeta cubano que todos lo conocen por las 6 letras de su nombre y que mas de 80 mil personas ese dia cantaron sus canciones algunas sin poder creerlo.Un disco indispensable"
3,Silvio Rodriguez double CD,"This CD took a while to arrive (about 2 weeks) and it did not come with the plastic wrapping that the CDs normally have. I wonder if it was a used CD? If that was not the case, I was not aware of it. Other than that, it was fine.Thanks,"
2,Disappointed,What good pictures are these people talking about?!? Did they buy a different book? The whole thing is in BLACK and WHITE except for a few pics in the middle of the book. If I want only tech data I will get it thru other sources; when I buy a book on a car I like I expect to see great pictures.
4,Well written,"Before reading this book I kept seeing its title in many articles and books, so I decided to buy the book to see what the fuss is all about. Im no expert in poems but this book was very well written and many lines sound so beautiful when you read them. The story is very entertaining and the greatest thing was the way the devil was portrayed."
5,"Top of the line player, bottom of the line sound","I set out to purchase a DVD player to complement my already in place home theater setup. I previously had a second generation, yet ~2 year old Panasonic DVD player with the DTS output. I finally found a dealer with the S7700 in stock and bought it. Once installed, I was thoroughly impressed with everything but the sound. I purchased, along with the player, a 36"" Sony XBR WEGA TV, and, as expected, the picture quality was incredible. Unfortunately, I soon realized that I had a problem on my hands. After connecting the player into my sound equipment, there was something missing. The sound on my older player was much better than the Sony. Caveat emptor: If you are looking for a top-of-the-line player, purchase the DVP-S7700. It's ease of use and picture quality are great. If you have already invested a lot of money into a sound system that works great with your current player, beware... you are in for disappointment."
4,More on 24/96 output question,"I have been considering this player (though am having troublelocating a dealer that has one in stock), and have learned somethinguseful about the fact that the player downsamples its digital output to 48kHz. There is a company called MSB that offers a factory-installed modification that returns the digital output to 24/96.I do not work for this company and am not getting paid to post this message. On the contrary, if anything, it is good for Amazon and Sony at the bottom line for customers to know that there is a ""fix"" available for Sony's ill-advised decision to downsample output. If I didn't know of this myself, I would probably pass on the Sony player for this reason. For those interested, information about the modification can be found ... by searching MSB on the Web. Sorry I can't give you more details."
4,Funny,"Very Funny. Expected it to be stupid funny, but ended up being rather hilarious and identifiable. Not the usual Steve Carell."
1,Mind boggling how many positive reviews this movie got.,"I usually always look on IMDB before I watch a movie these days. I usually trust a movie's excellent rating. Sometimes, especially with comedies, you can't always trust a poor rating, since critics give comedies horrible reviews a lot of the time. However, with ""Date Night"", it generally got very favorable reviews.I cannot understand for the life of me how anyone would give this movie more than 1-star. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with any kind of budget, or star actor attached to it. I am usually pretty good with making it through movies, even when they stink. But I couldn't make it through this movie. I think I finally hit the STOP button with about 30 minutes left. At that point, I just simply didn't care anymore how the movie turned out. It was so bad, that the ending didn't even matter to me."
5,"Funny, great for parents","Funny and enjoyable, enough suspense to keep you glued to the screen. Esp. great for parents of young children. Two thumbs up."
3,"Blah movie, but WOWZA Mark Wahlberg stuns!","The movie is whatever, it's not great, the funny moments were mostly shown in the trailers, and it unexpectedly and unfortunately tries to be kind of heartwarming. But it's definitely worth watching for Mark Wahlberg's role as ""sexy man who won't put a shirt on"". His main purpose in this movie is to look good with his shirt off (and how many men are better at this than Mark Wahlberg?) and to make Steve Carell feel inadequate. This makes the movie worthwhile for me. So rent the movie for the sake of seeing the movie, buy the movie for the sake of owning Shirtless-Mark-Wahlberg video. : )"
1,Colossal disappointment,"Every single person that acted in this film is fantastic, some I would even call geniuses. This movie is not a good reflection of their ability and should be viewed by no one. The pacing is predictable, music canned, script vanilla, and the stakes were forced. Everyone that worked on this film is far better than the sum of its parts."
4,Entertaining,This movie was funny and for the most part family friendly. Pole dancing scene the exception. Good entertainment for adults.
2,NOT Extended Edition,"Bought Date Night from Amazon. The product description says its the extended edition and gives a list of special features. The one I received is a ""Rental Exclusive"" with no special features and is repackaged. Obviously Amazon is loosing their touch. I am very disappointed that Amazon can't even be bothered to send me the version they advertised as having. Buy from someone else, maybe even go to the store, because paying that much for a basic copy from an old video store, is simply not worth it."
5,I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.,"If you are looking for pure entertainment with nonstop laughs and some action and romance thrown in for good measure, Date Night is the perfect movie. I don't remember a romantic action comedy this good since Romancing the Stone in the 80s. Steve Carrell and Tina Fey play a ""boring married couple from New Jersey"" who try to add some spice to their marriage by going on a date night in the city where they are mistaken for a couple involved in blackmail and chased all over town by thugs. The story is mediocre, but Carrell and Fey have outstanding chemistry and do a wonderful job of portraying a very normal couple in extremely absurd circumstances. Nothing profound or artistic here, but there are some tender moments interspersed with the raunchy humor and nearly nonstop action. This movie is a great choice for good old fashioned fun entertainment - especially if you watch with a date."
3,Rent it...,Pretty decent flick. Not the best movie I've ever seen but it did have its funny moments. It's worth seeing for some laughs. A rental at best.
3,CARELL AND FEY MAKE A SILK PURSE FROM A SOW'S EAR!,"Despite some very over used clichés, Carell and Fey really make the most of this funny comedy. Clocking in under an hour and a half including credits, this film is consistently fun, but dwells on the ""hum drum"" marriage thing in the first act. Once the hijacks set in, it is silly fun for the rest of the ride and not to be taken the least bit seriously."
5,Hilarity!!,"I think this movie is HILARIOUS! Tina Fey & Steve Carell make a great comedy team. I love the part with James Franco and Mila Kunis and also the part with the taxi cab. If you haven't seen it, trust me... funny!"
3,Ok for a chick flick,If your woman is going to make you watch a chick flick and you have an option to choose which one. You would be ok with this one.
2,One of the most forgettable comedies I've seen in quite a while,"If you're thinking about checking this one out, I'm pretty sure you'd just be better off skipping on it. I can watch pretty much any dumb comedy and get some good laughs out of it, but almost the whole time I was watching this movie I thought, ""I'm pretty sure there should be something funny happening right now"" and ""Well, I can see how this scene is technically supposed to be funny."" I know most people would think this would be pretty funny because Steve Carell and Tina Fey are in it (I mean, that's why I wanted to see it). But the reality is that this movie is so bland that if Carell and Fey didn't sign on to do it, I can't imagine it ever being made. There are maybe a couple of laughs here, but not much more than that."
2,Not funny...,This was not funny at all... I was expecting something funnier considering Steve Carell and Tina Fey were in it. A total disappointment. I actually want my money back.
4,Decent comedy,"This is a could-have-been-better effort, especially if you consider that the film stars two of the funniest people on Television/Big screen.Still, it's a decent effort and I laughed quite a bit. I am a bit biased toward Tina and Steve, though. The only quip I have is with Bill Burr, one of my favourite comedians.He stars as Detective Walsh and barely says a word in this film. Who zipped him up? What's the point of his roll if he's only allowed to mumble?"
2,Surprisingly dissapointing!,"I hate to say I was disappointed by Date Night! Granted I had high expectations given that Steve Carell and Tina Fey were the leads but it was just poorly written and poorly directed. The movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a crime farce and failed badly at both. Also, Carell and Fey, despite being very funny people had zero chemistry.Having said that one of the best parts of the movie were the supporting characters. Mark Whalberg was excellent especially the parts regarding how he chose to expose himself. James Franco and Mila Kunis were also very funny as the bickering sleazebags. I also think that Ray Liotta is an underutilized comedian and was hysterical in this role. If the movie used the support cast more it would have been great!Sadly this is both weak and lame!"
5,Very Funny,This movie was very funny. I loved the all the characters and I am glad I bought it. well worth the money.
2,I Laughed . . .,I laughed only during one single scene in the whole movie. What a disappointment after reading good reviews on the film.
1,Save your $$$-This movie isn't Funny!,"This movie is the biggest pile of Not Funny, I have seen in awhile! You would think with 2 comic super stars, I would get lots of laughs but not in this dung heap! Save your $$$ This one is a dog with alot of fleas and maybe BED BUGS."
1,Embarrassing,"If this is what Steve Carell left The Office for I feel really bad for him, embarrassed. This is a bad movie. Unlike The Office or 30 Rock I felt like they were ""acting"" - horribly! I got to get this movie out of my mind or I will never be able to watch Steve or Tina again!"
1,"How awkward, Yawn...","I like Steve Carell, but this was just a painful movie to watch. It was awkward and extremely boring. Yawn, Yawn, Yawn."
1,"BE WARNED, this movie should have recieved an R rating!","Despite having jokes that fall flat time and time again, your treated to extremly crude locker room humor that I would have felt so uncomfortable with had there been a teen in the room. I wont even go into the long sex club sequence that I chose to fast foward through. Completely irresponsable and unfunny to boot."
5,hilarious!,I think Mark Wahlberg made this movie! He played a supporting actor to Tina Fey's character. His acting and deadpan humor stole the show from the two leads.kenneth haft
2,Note to Steve Carell - Spares us more bad movies,"What do you get what when you cross some really connected Hollywood backers, desperate actors who will do anything for a buck and a great PR team? You get Date Night. Notice there were no writers in the equation because the story was a severe after-thought in this time sucking piece of Hollywood garbage. The story was disjointed at best, the tempo swung from somberly serious divorce preaching to whimsical humor in a millisecond and somehow there was the meaningless action story tie-in. Steve Carell is such an obvious money hog that it is a waste of time to see his films. He's shown what he can do, now we need a replacement, he is played out.Don't waste your time with this movie it's not a good comedy, action movie or moral story. The only joke in the movie is on the person who paid to watch this."
4,goodmovie,"This was a cute, funny movie with interesting twists. Definitely worth the time and money and reasonably family friendly. Good characters"
2,I Laughed a Few Times,"I could only laugh at the slapstick, though. I don't think the comedic aspects of this film were enough to put up with the terrible plot. Much of it was ridiculous. If you are into that sort of thing, then this movie might be for you. For the talent involved and all the money spent on stupid effects and set props, there should have been a lot more laughter going on. Typical audiences must be easily impressed. I respect Steve Carell and Tina Fey otherwise, but I think their talent was wasted in this movie. There was a poor balance between clever situations and the believable nature of the action. If you want people to laugh at the funny situations, then emphasize them more with funny camera shots and an obviously supportive soundtrack. In other words, the tone, mood, and pace in many of the scenes took away from the comedy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,"""Not Bad Comedy!""","Steve Carell and Tina Fey star in this 2010 comedy.A married couple get a case of mistaken identitywhen trying to have a romantic evening. This isn'tbad and Steve and Tina are great together. Thisdvd not only has nice picture and sound, butrated & unrated cuts of the film plus neatextras. I still recommend this."
5,enjoyed it from beginning to end,"I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Yes the story line was ridiculous and not believable, but I really enjoy Tina Fey and Steve Carrell's style of humor. The dry, sarcastic sense of humor was great throughout the movie. I loved it!"
2,Disappointing,"""Date Night"" with Steve Carell and Tina Fey was disappointing. I love Tina Fey as a comedian and I also love Steve Carell in many of his other movies. With high expectations of both actors I expected this movie to be amazing. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie was good but then as it continued, instead of going uphill, it progressively became worse. Although it was action packed and comedic at some points, these moments were few and far between."
1,Disappointing,"Positives:The 3 seconds of Apple Computer laptop logo paid spot; the usual oldies song; some of the outtakes are actually funnier than any scene in the entire ""comedic"" movie. Except the PSA extras were as unfunny as the movie.Negatives:Very tired script; no story and in fact what might pass as a script was a very tired rerun of the tiresome white middle class married couple telling really weak fantasy sex jokes and being chased by the usual bad guys; obviously a wing-it, ""make it up as we go"", directing style that produces disjointed weak & superficial acting and plot. In fact the movie just seems like one quickly rehearsed weekly Comedy TV skit after another only much weaker because each skit is forced to connect to another thus forming a losing-me sleeper story."
2,Almost all the good parts were in the commercials,"This movie is extremely slow and not very funny. I love Tina Fey and I just could not get past how boring it is, and I really tried. Save your money and watch the commercials for it."
2,Think National Lampoon Family Vacation,"This movie had potential, but never seemed to develop the depth needed. We never really care about this couple, fear the villains, or feel that there is any real trouble here at all. And the humor and gags are painful to watch and never really get more deep than sophomoric Chevy Chase style humor. Suggest looking elsewhere for your date night."
2,Difficult to sit through. Wanna take the challenge?,"After watching some great Carell films like 40 year old virgin, Dan in real life and Little Miss Sunshine - I expected myself to watch just about any Steve Carell film that came along. I made the mistake of watching Date Night.This film is terrible, there is no story and the saving grace is the first scene with Wahlberg who becomes so uncool and repeated the way they've used him.Tina Fey should stick to television though. I can imagine her 20 years from now in a film like Doubt but right now is not her time. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of The Office, Entourage or even 30 Rock, there is no premise to this film and its awful.Avoid at all costs."
1,Filthy Mouths,"This movie had the potential of being really cute. Oh well, some parts were funny, but for the most part it just consisted of a bunch of people with foul little mouths. It was kind of like listening to middle schoolers try to out do each other with disgusting comments. What a waste"
1,Horrendous!,"This movie is painful to watch. Sadly, these 2 actors have irreparably damaged their careers making this film. I would give Fey another chance but I'm afraid the true carroll might have been exposed."
3,"Not bad if you are on a date, but don't watch it alone","Thank God I saw this movie with my wife. I was bored out of my mind, but she loved it. So probably it is a good chic flick. Steve Carell is funny as usual, and Kristin Wigg always whips out a good performance. Worth it for a date, but if I was alone, I would have turned it off."
2,Disappointing,"Thee are moments of sheer brilliance between these two remarkably funny and talented people, but the vehicle was too awful for them to overcome."
4,Great Saturday Night DVD Watching!,"I'm glad I waited to see this on DVD...just because it really translates well to the small screen. I found the movie funny and loved all the little ""skits"" within each story that went on. The table chatter was cute, the whole James Franco scene was hysterical and the on-going ""drawers are open"" was great. The car chases were over the top but were done really well. Steve and Tina have a natural chemistry that wasn't forced or top-heavy. Both held their own against each other. Mark Wahlberg had a great part..shirtless the entire time. Cute movie to rent for you and hubby or partner to watch when you don't want to think too much. Extras included were outakes and some cast interviews. The outtakes were the best parts of course...sometimes funnier than what made it into the movie!"
4,Steve Carell and Tina Fey elevate an average script into good entertainment,"Steve Carell and Tina Fey are two of the most appealing actors working today, and the thought of them working together sounds great. For the most part, this film is a comedy of errors, stemming from Steve Carrell's character's decision to take the table of ""The Tripplehorns"" at a restaurant, only to discover two approaching men, who question Phil and Claire (Steve Carrell and Tina Fey) about a flash drive they believe Phil and Claire stole from mobster boss Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta).The script is completely average; there is nothing offensive or objectionable, but there is nothing really original or outstanding, either. What is enjoyable in the film, however, is the performances from Steve Carrell and Tina Fey. In short, the actors are better than the material. For fans of these actors, this film is recommended."
4,Smart and funny,We watched it for the second time. My son wanted to share it with his grandmother. :) she laughed as much as he did.
3,Eh,"With a starring duo like Steve Carrell and Tina Fey, I was expecting this movie to be better. A married couple with kids wants to go out for a romantic date night, what married couple doesn't want that? So on the story goes, but... eh. It is not without funny scenes, but ultimately, this movie failed to deliver. The writing and story simply were not compelling, and the story just ended up going nowhere with a ridiculous ending."
4,"Light, Funny and Enjoyable","Nothing special about the story line but the performances were very well done, especially the slapstick. Movie fit personas of Steve Carell and Tina Fey to a T. Fun and relaxing to watch."
1,Rubbish,"""Date Night"" is a very bad film. It's touted as being a modern comedy but is, in reality, little more than slapstick. I failed to even raise a grin let alone laugh. People suggesting this is a comedy are in danger of contravening truth in advertising laws.The plot, in brief, centres around a ""typical"" couple from New Jersey who happen to stumble across a criminal conspiracy involving police, organised crime and the potential New York district attorney. It is a far fetched plot that tests the credulity of even the most sympathetic viewer. Indeed, it is simply absurd.Don't waste two hours of your life. Avoid this film!"
1,Horrible Movie -- Forget It,"Within 5 minutes I knew we were in trouble. We gutted it out for 30 minutes, then turned it off. Movie was so bad we couldn't stand it anymore. Wasn't even remotely funny."
1,Worst Movie Ever,The first part of the movie was really bad (including the attempts at humor); I don't know about the second half -- I just couldn't take any more -- six references to penis humor in less than a minute seemed to be excessive. There was no redeeming value in this pathetic attempt...
5,fun movie,"I really liked the movie when i saw it in theater and so buying it was a great plan. The movie arrived quickly (like all my amazon things :)) and nothing was scratched or broken. The story is fun and good for a date night, plus i love the two main actors so together they make a hilarious team!"
3,It had some laughs,But it just didn't have the writing that put it up there as a really good comedy. It was ok.
4,A good laugh,"While not a knock out drag out laugh-fest, Date Night has its moments and is an enjoyable film for your time, but it is more of a one time watch than a go-to comedy."
4,Funny - Light hearted - Feel Good,"I really liked it. I didn't watch it to be inspired but to be entertained, and it did a VERY excellent job. My husband liked it alot too."
5,Crying Laughing...,"It is not often that I laugh through movies, but this movie was funny. It felt good to laugh. I had to go back before writing this review just to watch the scene with Mark Wahlberg. I have tears in my eyes! I laughed so hard."
1,Bad movie,"The only good thing ia the cast, other than that this is one of the worst movies I've ever been"
1,Pass,"This movie looked like it would be a big win with such a great cast, but it was absolutely horrible! There was not one point in the movie where I actually cared what happened and didn't even finish watching it. If you like funny movies - this is a total pass!"
4,"Was what was listed, and came quickly.",The listing was very accurate. The item rrived very quickly. The site was very easy to follow and work with. Will definately buy from here again. The item was not damaged or tampered with when it arrived.
1,"Crude, Inane, Poorly Acted, Boring","Even more importantly, it was so bad it was painful to watch. There's nothing clever, original or funny about it."
3,"Good enough, but should have been so much better","It fails the Siskel test, in that the viewer keeps suspecting that the jokes that Steve Carrell and Tina Fey told each other in the makeup chair were funnier and less formulaic than this movie, but it is entertaining, and Carrell and Fey are both completely game and utterly likable. Plus, I am one half a boring, married, middle-aged couple in New Jersey, so I was required to enjoy this movie."
3,"Not great, but you could do worse","I had heard that ""Date Night"" was terrible, but it wasn't that bad. While Steve Carrell and Tina Fey do versions of their characters from ""The Office"" and ""30 Rock,"" it's a lot better than ""Evan Almighty"" or the really bad ""Baby Mama"" as there are a lot of fun cameos and just enough good lines to make up for the bad ones. Two and a half stars rounded to three."
3,"Funny, but nothing special really...","This is a pretty funny movie. I did laugh on a few occasions, but the comedy was very predictable and if you've seen one of the trailers you've pretty much seen the movie. Jokes about Marky Mark needing to put on a shirt, gun shootout jokes, our sex life is boring jokes, etc. Nothing really original here. And I've seen a lot funnier movies from Carell - notably ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Get Smart."" There was no comedy in the movie that really wowed me or had me laughing more than a chuckle.I liked the pairing of Fey & Carell and I thought they worked well together, I think perhaps though the writing was a weak effort in this film. It's short too at only about 80 minutes. I would wait for the DVD and save yourself a movie theatre ticket price. There is nothing so special here that you can't simply wait for a DVD rental. Make that a $1 kiosk rental too!Final Grade: C+"
2,So so flick,"I expected much more from Tina Fey. I was mildly amused by the film, but silly shallow story.A waste of my time."
3,I expected funnier,"What can I say? It was enjoyable, but in the end ... I expected much funnier. I liked the running joke (""What kind of people DO that???""). The car chase was a dud, and overlong. I expected Mark Wahlberg to do more than ride a keyboard, after they had built up his reputation so much.So, fun and sweet, but a letdown."
2,Uhmmm...I was not enthralled with this.,"This film gets two stars for Mark Wahlberg having his shirt off and my man Common for playing the crooked cop. However, everything else was just some inane film schlock. Don't get me wrong I chuckled maybe twice throughout the whole film. Tina Fey was funny on SNL and 30 Rock but seemed toned down in this. Steve Carell basically acted how he does on the office and clawd have mercy, what in the hot hell happened to Ray Liotta's face. His face looks like somebody threw a brown wig on some soggy wheat bread.And why in the hell was he wearing so much wet N wild eyeliner around his eyes I will never know. But I digress. All in all, it was pretty forgettable and not all that. Could have spent 2 hours trying to rip my adult teeth out by hand. That would have made for a more enjoyable evening."
2,Skips,I did not like this Vinyl. It skips. And the quality isn't what was describes. I would recommend not selling this item.
1,Martial art teacher,I thought the book was terrible. I dont know who he is trying to kid.he sounded like he was responable was the whole war . he needs to get a grip.you can whine all you want. Nothing that happened in viet nam had anything to do with an 18 year old kid. what can you do about the past but forget it.I wouldnt have gave it one star but I had to and yes I was in viet nam in 1968.
1,Worst Brush I Have Ever Purchased,I would not recommend this brush to anyone. As soon as I got it I ran it through my own hair and the pins just crumbled out of the brush. If it does that for my hair how is it going to handle horse hair!!?? It just has completely disintegrated after using it on my own hair about three times. Completely worthless!!!
1,lots of better resources are out there,"Of limited value. If you're a prospective, current or recent journalism student, you'll find little here that isn't covered in course lectures, labs and texts. If you're an aspiring nonfiction writer who intends to circumvent J-school en route to publication, you readily can obtain volumes of superior writing examples and more insightful commentary.Most of Sova's instruction is sound. It often smacks of immaturity in terms of on-the-ground journalism and writing savvy, however. Some of her ""bad"" writing examples are construed. Some of the ""good"" passages are marred by editorializing, journalese and an amateurish approach. Campus-related events or angles provide the bulk of her writing samples and ideas, raising questions about the breadth of her reporting experience. (Possibly it means she wrote the book specifically for college students. If so, the publisher should have indicated that on the cover; I see no such hint.)"
2,A big disappointment,"Plumb's sophomore effort, Candycoatedwaterdrops, was truly a masterpiece, so I assumed that the group's debut CD would be at least as good. Boy, was I wrong.The lyrics are definitely deep and thought- provoking, but the music just doesn't sound very good, almost like a Christian version of No Doubt (Think ""I'm Just a Girl"" and ""Spiderweb"").Tiffany Arbuckle has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Unfortunately, on this CD the instrumentation (which sounds very amateurish)almost drowns out her harmonies completely.Don't get me wrong. I think Plumb is awesome. I just can't believe how bad this CD sounds compared to their second one. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on Candycoatedwaterdrops. It's a million times better."
5,Plumb's Best,"Plumb undeservedly do not get the attention they deserve, probably as a result of being labeled Christian-Contemporary. That they are, but so are Flyleaf and Paramore and Skillet-all of whom get airplay on non-Christian radio. Like Flyleaf and Paramore, there are no outwardly Christian lyrics, just underlying hints. Plumb has a wonderful female singer, who leads a wonderful rock band. Forget the Christian label; they are rock, and the first three songs prove it. This album and this band should be considered by everyone, regardless of religious affiliation or, more likely, lack thereof."
5,PERFECT!,"This is the SECOND time I have bought this CD. I bought it several years ago and I lost it. This CD is so good, I bought it again. That should tell you something! Every track on this disc is really great. I discovered Plumb when they opened up for Jars of Clay at a concert several years ago.Plumb has released other albums since this one but I don't think the others are as good (from the snipets I've heard at Amazon and other website). You know how a band always has one album that is better than anything they have ever produced? Well for Plumb, this album is the one.Musically I would say they sound a lot like Garbage, just with better lyrics."
5,Better than the second one,"i love this album, and it's the reason i name plumb ""one of my favorite bands"" it's definately better than their second one, because it's darker and has originallity musicly speaking, where ""candycoatewaterdrops"" is poppier. although i love this whole album, my favorites are numbers 3, 8, 10 and 6. if you want some alternative that is orginal, get this album. yah yah yah yah yah!"
3,No memory! Where is the 16 Mb announced!,"I just bought the new NZ90 to replace a NR70V/U. My first surprise was during the first HotSync. A message warning that there was no memory space popped up! So what I had in my old machine was no longer handle by the new one? The answer is YES!Looking at the specifications in the manual it is stated that ""User memory range: approx. 11 MB"" This is not what is in the specifications available in the add. They say 16 MB ROM and 16 MB RAM. Where is all this memory that I cannot use?I'm feeling like a fool. I trusted in Sony, I like Sony, and I now have to open hand of some softwares that I like and was used to have on my old Clié. NOT A GOOD FEELING!Also I sent a message to Sony support and got no answer until now. BAD FEELING."
2,Sony Refuses to Learn from Past Mistakes!,"I was convinced that this device or its little brother the Nx70 would be the best thing since sliced bread for the student or businessman. Then I discovered Sony was up to its old proprietary tricks again by utilizing only their memory stick and no other method of storage such as the commonly used, less expensive, and easiily procured CF or SD cards. When will Sony realize this type of marketing only reduces the number of sales and increases buyer animosity. Due to this tactic, I opted for the Toshiba and have not been disappointed yet."
4,An awesome experience,"This is a PDA users dream. Yes the price is a little up there but you get what you pay for.The camera is truly beautifal. OS5 is a breeze to use. Also it has many other extras, built in indicators, bluetooth, Wirleless etc.I highly recommend this product."
5,helpful product,"It's cliff notes. They work. I think a person should use it as an additional tool towards understanding some of the writers intentions in the book and not relying on the cliff notes to replace reading the book. This is a wonderful story, written in a way that I could not put it down after about the first few pages. It is an easy read and a small book and you would miss out on a lot if you use the cliff notes incorrectly but as far as cliff notes go this one was very helpful."
5,Old Man and the Sea,"I think that these cliff notes realy helped me in my report. They made everything clear when after I read the book. I bought a used edition and it was clean and nice. I really think that whoever needs cliff notes at a low price should come her to buy them!! Besides, this is a really good book!!"
3,Not the original,Not the original - un-named studio musicians with some different instruments cover Peter Gunn - skip it and buy the original
1,Very disappointing,"The color was not red, but a light pink. The lead was hard and scratchy. I could neot even see the lines unless I used heavy pressure."
3,Didn't believe it till I saw it,"The reviews before mine didn't lie. This lead is junk. I have blue and red and they both break if they're more than 1 click out. I use them with a uni Kuru Toga pencil as well as a Paper-mate clear point ultra, and they brake all the time. And by all the time, I mean more than once within a sentence. (I use them for notes) Additionally, they are non-erasable, so I might as well use a red pen. Finally, for the price and how many sticks you get (about a dozen) it's not worth it. I would look for something cheaper and more disposable like real colored pencils, though the whole reason I wanted these was because I didn't want colored pencils...For best results, I keep my pencil almost perpendicular to the page and press in a sort of pendulum motion instead of a stroke. (hard to explain but it works for the most part)"
2,Red Lead Refill - Too Soft,"This lead is very soft. If you push out more than a millimeter, it breaks. I find I cannot use this lead without feeling the metal of the pencil scraping the paper. If you advance it any further, the lead breaks.Very disappointing product."
2,mechanical red pencil lead,The idea is nice but the lead doesn't write dark enough nor does it erase easily.
3,fan control,this is a updated fan control from the original. they dont give any instructions about taking the ground wire off and i kept burning out transformers. planet plumbing was very helpful with my problem. if you need this control make sure you take the ground wire off the circut board.
5,First Class Death-N-Roll,"This album rocks. Stay away form Same Difference, and get this. Guaranteed to get the head banging."
1,bad music,looking for self defense book got this music cd. tried it hated the music I think they are just idiotic.
4,check this band out!,"I just saw these guys open up for King's X in Cincinnati Saturday night. I was very impressed with their original sound. Check them out if you get a chance. To me they sound like Nirvana with Stevie Ray Vaughan on lead guitar.The only downside was: they seemed to have no ability to ""work"" a crowd live. They didn't even look like they were having fun. The members of the band didn't even look at each other and they didn't get the crowd involved at all."
1,Horrible,"These are NOT like the original pinkies. They are solid foam and hard.They stink. There is a horrible strong chemical smell....presumably mostly from the ink used for the large logo...and they have a greasy feel. I scrubbed off the ink with some liquid pumice hand cleaner, soaked them in strong detergent, and still can't get rid of the odor.I bought them for my dog. Even with the stink somewhat reduced, he won't go near a ball....backs away from it. If I hadn't been able to get the ink off and the smell somewhat reduced, I wouldn't have given him one in the first place....that is so toxic smelling.I'll be donating these....since they're clean, I guess it won't harm children to play with them.I'll go order the more expensive Spaldings now."
5,Pinky balls to the rescue!,"Pinky balls are fun, my dogs love them, and they are a traditional rubber ball for kids to play with. They also happen to work better than tennis balls for keeping ham radio antennas from rubbing on your car. Good transaction, product was exactly as expected."
5,Just what i wanted,"This product was everything it says it is. These balls are the perfect size for juggling and are just bouncy enough for those learning how to bounce juggle. Also they come at a great price and couldn't be more fun. If you're looking for juggling balls, bounce juggling balls or just high bounce balls these are perfect."
3,not your 1950's-1960's pink ball,"Bought these mistakenly thinking they were the air-filled balls we played with growing up, for handball, wallball, stepball etc, didn't read they were solid rubber. They're a rubber ball with decent bounce, not too hard to be painful to catch, but they have a seam around their equator that can make a bounce erratic. If you're looking for a dog ball, these would do fine. For serious play, buy the real deal Spaulding high bouncers. Hopefully someone will soon be making the white pimple balls again, too, which were a superior play ball."
2,not high bounce,"These are not as ""high bounce"" as are the other pinky balls - can't recommend them, as they are a little ""dead""."
5,pink balls for plantar fasciitis and trigger points!,Fantastic item. Inexpensive for a set of several pink balls.. This will be great to provide this therapeutic rubber balls to most of your clients.
5,ancient egyptian fashions,"ancient egyptian fashions by tom tierney is a great book. in this book you will see what old kingdom pharaoh's and their wifes dressed in, as well as princess's, scribes, painter's, egyptian couples of rank, dancer's, and women. you will also see middle kingdom pharaoh's and queen's, men and women, maidservant's from the court, dancer's and slaves. you will also see new kingdom pharaoh's including hatshepsut the female pharaoh, you will see queen's, noble couples, priest's, soldier's, court musicians, musicians, and a princess and a slave. you will also see gods like osiris, thoth,anubis, and amun. you will see the hair styles of ancient egypt as well. this is a great book on ancient egyptian fashions."
5,Priceless Drama,"This is my first venture into the Curtis Black series. It was outstanding from the first page to the last page. Being a Preacher's Kid myself, I am fully aware of all the drama that goes on in front of and behind the scene in churches. There is more cheating going on there than anywhere else. This was a delightful read and now I have to back track and read about his previous marriages.Zane"
4,Another Bestseller,"This story of the Black Famliy issues are full of surprises...and yes - very well hidden best kept secrets!The author did a fantastic job in expressing the lengths in what people will go through to want to be forgiven and then at the same time ""maybe"" not be able to forgive others for the same sins.She causes the reader to penetrate deep into their pysche for sincere answers about the power of money, sex, lust, forgiveness and family bonds.Pastor Curtis Black - can a leopard change its' spots???I enjoy this author's novels, but it's time to move on to new and different characters. A good book for enjoyment and recommended."
5,"Indeed, ""The Best Kept Secret""!","This was truly a great read. I loved the turns and twists. Kim did a great job picking up where ""Too Much Of A Good Thing"" left off. I'm looking forward to hearing more from Rev. Black and his busy self."
5,The tide changes for the Rev. Curtis Black!!,"Before you read this one, you must read ""Casting the First Stone"" and ""Too Much of a Good Thing"". Within the first two chapters, you are drawn deep into the world of Curtis Black and his now third wife! In this third and final sequel to of the life of the Rev. Black, he attempts to turn his life around and makes an effort to stay on the straight and narrow, but his new wife and his new best friend have ""The Best Kept Secret"" in town!!"
3,Put Curtis to Bed,"Sorry, but there was nothing exciting, moving, or even interesting about Ms. Roby's latest effort. Her writing style has changed drastically, like she's gotta force up a dramatic tale. However, she missed the mark by a long shot. Charlotte son not Curtis' Charlotte a slut, Curtis getting his, could have been executed much better had we seen it coming in previous novels. Move on from Curtis Black. In fact, Ms. Roby can take a break. She's earned it just like Omar Tyree, EJD, Terry McMillan, and even Zane's novels are now wickety wacked as quiet as it's kept! Perhaps Ms. Roby's next title should be The Same Ole Same Ole Must End! LOL"
3,Let's Put Curtis to bed,"Because I've read all of Ms. Roby's other books I give this 3 stars. I particularly enjoyed ""Here and Now"" so fans of Ms. Roby pick up a copy and you won't be disappointed. Back to ""The Best-Kept Secret"", I do hope that this is the last of Curtis Black, although he was a changed man and Charlotte was doing what he did in the last book, enough already!! I wasn't particulary ""stunned"" at the end of the book as mentioned on the inside cover of the book. By all means I would recommnend this book but fans know that this is not Ms. Roby's best and don't let this book stop you from reading her other books and books to come. Can't wait to read her next novel. Keep up the good work Ms. Roby!!"
4,Captivating,"Very interesting, good storyline I'll definitely be reading more of her books as this was a first for me."
1,Adultery Should NOT Be Condoned,"I don't think it is a good idea to endorse a book where a pastor, especially, who is the leader of the church can go from woman to woman and it is acceptable. The Bible plainly states that if a man desires a leadership position in the church, he must be the husband of ONE wife (not one wife at a time). Curtis Black has two wives and who knows how many affairs. The Bible also plainly states that if the leader of the church cannot rule in his own home, how can he lead the church of God?"
2,Been there done that,While I have to admit I love Ms. Roby's books. I did not love The Best Kept Secret. Why you may ask? Because I read this story in Casting The First Stone and Too Much Of A Good Thing. Can you say sick of Curtis Black!!!! Cause I am. I mean come on didn't we go through this same thing once before. Ok maybe he's not quite as bad but his wife is doing exactly the same things he did. And Ms. Roby please tell me you're not setting us up for a forth installment cause I can't take it. How about we revisit the characters in Behind Closed Doors or Tastes of Reality. I would have given this book one star if it was by another author but I love Ms. Roby to much.
4,Curtis got his just dessert!,"I've read all of Kimberla Lawson-Roby's books and have never been disappointed. And that trend continues with The Best kept secret.Charlotte was out cold! I don't feel sorry for Curtis not in the least bit. The way he treated innocent women in the past was just awful. He tried to change but he can't. He's back to his old ways.I think the next book should focus on Curtis' children or child which ever one is true. I think it should focus on the baby Marissa and her possible ""mental illness"". That would be a good story line.Even if you haven't read the first two books of this trilogy you can still read The Best kept secret. Ms. Roby explains what happened in the first two books very well in the beginning of this one. Everyone go get a copy. It's worth it."
1,"Stiff characters; nothing to make you say, ""WOW""","So sorry, but I feel compelled to write this. I picked up this book at the library and was so disappointed. The story is one-dimensional and it goes around and around in circles. I was sick to my stomach reading this nauseating story. It seems like the author was at a loss for words and plot. It was the most simplistically written and predictable story I've ever read. There were no plot twists and turns, just a story about a bad preacher turned good with a cheating wife and cheating best friend/deacon. The wife gets pregnant but doesn't know whether it's her preacher/husband's child or her lover/deacon's child. What a boring book! I couldn't even read a chapter at a time--I was reading 1.5 to 2 pages at a time before closing the book and picking it up later hoping that it would get better. But nope! It doesn't. Usually, I would read a good, pageturning book in one sitting. I just don't understand all of the 4 and 5 star ratings?"
3,Let Sleeping Dogs Lay,"I have kept up with Curtis Black and now I am done. I read this book a while ago but for some reason felt compelled to write a review.Curtis is back to his old ways and tricks. Having moved to yet another city to start over again, his wife has grown tired. When you do wrong it comes back to bite you, TENFOLD. Curtis is getting back everything he has done to any woman in his past thanks to his wife, Charlotte. Can Curtis keep his wife from growing tired and restless of being a pastor's wife? Can Curtis keep his wife, period? How long can Curtis keep being a ""saint'? For some reason I feel that this saga is going to keep going on and on."
4,Better Than What I Expected,The twists and turns in this book took me completely by surprise...I was finished reading within 2 days of getting the book in the mail...
4,Reap what you sow,"Curtis Black is back with wifey number 3, but this time the third Mrs Black is as devilish as her husband was. In this third book Curtis seems to have mended his ways and is doing right by his former teenage mistress who is now 25 years old. However all is not what it seems, Mrs Charlotte Black has some secrets that have a funny way of coming to light. Its obvious that there is another book after this for the ending is too open.I hope they are as enjoyable as this one."
4,A sober and sad look behind the scenes.,"I'm grateful that Mr. Brown wrote this book. Jimi is long overdue for fair treatment. He was one of those people not easily understood because of the depth of his sensitivity and individuality. But the main thing I feel concerning Jimi Hendrix is how much of a complete waste his premature death was. There is no telling what sort of musical pleasures he would have produced had he lived and had a chance to mature. Personally, as a black man that has never let himself be walled in by definitions of what ""blackness"" amounts to, it would have been so good to see Jimi continuing to knock down those stupid self-made racial barriers in ever more creative ways. But, alas, it wasn't to be. Tony Brown shows Jimi to be what we all are; fallible human beings who are driven by many frailties."
1,what a crock of s&*%!!!!,"First of all, jimi did not commit suicide...plain and simple. Even Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox have stated that jimi didn't believe in suicide because he believed that if you committed suicide then your soul would never be allowed to rest in peace. This book only focuses on rumors...it doesn't focus on the facts. So, if you wanna book that realisticly talks about the cause of jimi's death then this book is definetly not for you."
4,Italian Sessions,"I've owned half a dozen Chet Baker CD's and half of them were poorly recorded or the performances were mediocre. This album, however, is absolutely awesome. I've owned it for a couple of years and it is all scratched up but I still listen to it often. Chet is in top form here and the sound quality as well as the musicianship has to be the best I've ever heard. The strength of material wanes a bit after track 5 but this is still remarkable stuff. There is no singing on this album for those of you looking for a vocal CD (try My Funny Valentine-it's great). His tone is so powerful on this CD and really pries at something inside -- a great recording and a fantastic CD. You can't go wrong here."
5,Can't beat a Chilton's Manual,"I work for an auto parts store that offers hayne's Manuals. Let me tell you, they suck. Chilton's Manuals have been around for forever! Their quality of pics and information are top notch! Don't bother with anything but the best! Buy a Chilton's Manual !!!"
4,Good,"Pretty handy, could use a few more pictures but best I've found yet for my nova. Pretty good instructions and covers a range of years."
2,"ok engine rebuild book, but very little info specific to Nova","This manual has basic information on engine rebuilding, but minimal information specific to the Chevy Nova."
4,Marvin Sease Is Unbelievable!!!,"I live in OKC and drove all the way to TX to see this man in concert along with Johnny Taylor. It was a surprise to everyone when Marvin Sease ended up being the show. After performing an awesome show with his incredible band; he came and took pictures, sign autographs and met all that wanted to meet him. If you have never seen him perform all I can say is buckle your seatbelt when you do. He's great!!!"
1,This book is a waste of time,It only touches on the terrible stories and none of the solutions and even the stories are not told well. The book is full of spelling errors and is actually more discouraging to survivors than helpful.
3,"If you're really interested, go for it!","Not for the faint-hearted, find the anthropologist within and spend some devoted time getting into this book about the People of the Coast. If you have any interest in the historic or mercantile aspects of the Swahili civilization and culture, we'd recommend it. Not for light readers, though."
3,Haven't worn them yet...but cute and comfortable,I haven't worn these yet so I don't know how comfortable they are. But they're cute and the heel is low so I can deal. I'll post again after I wear them.
3,"Great illustrations, story could be better..","I got this book for my 3 year old and while he enjoys it very much, I found the story to be just okay. It would have been better if the characters in the book tried to invite all the people they met along the way instead of discouraging them from tagging along. I found the sentences to be a bit long too. The glossary in the back was a nice touch. The illustrations in this book are beautiful."
3,Beautiful Book,"Beautifully illustrated book. My daughter enjoyed reading it.The ""A Word about Mumbai"" section at the end of the book has incorrect factual information though. Hence the 3 stars."
5,B-day gift for my niece,I bought this and a few more books for my niece's birthday. I read this particular book to her the after the celebrations and she absolutely loved it. She woke up the next morning and the 1st thing she said to her mom was that this was her favorite gift!! Whose your favorite uncle!
2,"Nice illustrations, but factually incorrect",The author needs to fact check before publishing. Gujarati is not the major language of the people who live in Mumbai. It is Marathi.This carelessness mars the otherwise nice illustrations in this book.
5,Excellent book for those wanting to understand these special children!,"This book is absolutely wonderful! Having a granddaughter with hyperlexia, this book helped me to understand her special behaviors and also showed me ways to help her develop her early reading skills. I highly recommend this book to anyone who works with one of these very special children!"
3,Still unsure,Still not sure - I find it difficult to apply and doesn't seem to go on smoothly. It is also very difficult to figure out what shade you need online.
3,Very thick and get's everywhere,"This make-up comes out very thick, and if you follow the instructions you end up with a blob of make-up surrounding your hairline. I try and mix it on my palm with some face lotion, but still it is very thick. Not a good product for anyone who wants light to medium coverage."
1,Terrible Product in my opinion,Waaay overpriced and the color is terrible. Turned a yellow color on my beige toned skin. Don't waste your money. Anything from the drugstore is better than this stuff.
5,Beautiful!,"The second I laid eyes on this stroller, I fell in love! It is a beautiful stroller. You can see and feel the excellent quality of the stroller. It is super light weight and to use the matching car seat, is as simple as 1-2-3! The stroller folds very compactly as opposed to other big strollers. The weight is what sealed the deal. It is VERY light weight! Very impressed with the stroller! The price wasn't even an issue when I realized the superb quality of the stroller!"
1,tipping hazard!,"After reading such glowing reviews, I had planned to purchase this strolller. I brought my four year old and one year old to the store and put the one year old in it. When my four year old jumped on the back, she would have completely tipped the stroller over with her baby brother inside had I not held the handles tightly. She is very average size for her age. Even the store employees were shocked. I would never buy this stroller. If our daughter ever decided to hop on it for even a brief second without me, the stroller would definitely tip over backward. One previous reviewer mentioned a good ranking from Consumer Reports. Actually, Consumer Reports gave this stroller a black circle (worst possible rating) for safety. Now I understand why."
3,If I had it to do over I would have gotten a different one...,"I have the stroller, matching infant seat & the Peg Perego Diaper bag. After doing a lot of research on infant seats & strollers this seemed like the best combination. It does fold & unfold relatively easily, it's lightweight & compact when folded. However, it has some faults as well. Sometimes it doesn't feel as sturdy as I'd like it to, I wish the handles were a bar that went all the way across - you cannot steer it with one hand as it is. Also, the handles aren't tall enough. I'm 5'7"" and feel like they are just a little shorter than I'd like and my husand, who's 6'3"" is uncomfortable and slouched over trying to push this. It is really very cute but if I had it to do over again I would have choosen something else."
5,One of the best books on rhetoric and on Lincoln,"Honor's Voice is terrific in two respects: both for its insights into Lincoln and for its insights into effective communication. I recommend it to anyone who uses words for a living, and for anyone who wants a fascinating, insightful look into how Lincoln crafted some of the most important speeches in our nation's history."
4,Shows Lincoln as a rounded person,"The fascinating thing about this book is that it shows you how historians and propagandists, and even well-meaning friends and relatives, distort the historical record through selective memory and small alterations of events. By giving a number of accounts of a few stories about Lincoln as a young man, the author helps the reader come to their own conclusions about what might be the reality or the ""truth"" of a given situation. I really enjoyed this and it made me rethink some of the impressions I got from other biographies I have read."
5,auto repair made easy!,"I couldn't have done it without this book. The easy to follow, simplified instructions, makes do it yourself car repair possible for most anyone. You learn not only how to make your car run good, but you also learn how maintain your car for longer life. There is also a section in the book that gives you the know how to make your car look good too. This book was exactly what I needed plus more!"
2,For old dummies,"Despite the fact it is too basic (you can say: it is for dummies ,Ok?), it is too old, I mean it is out of date. For instance, my car is 2003, and most of the book content is related to cars with older technology. It covers autos with features of the 80s or 90s. If you have a car of this century ( 2000 and later), you need to look in another direction.I am disappointed, I expected more, and I got less."
5,This book is a life saver,"Before this book I didn't know a thing about cars. Now, I would still say that I don't but, I would NOT go to the mechanic for everything."
3,ehhhh your manual will probably give you more info,"this book is ok, but it really dosent help at all. I suggest just reading your manual in the glove box of your car. But if you want to prove me wrong then go ahead."
4,A Great New Album!,"I was lucky enough to buy this one at a concert and get it signed by the boys. I highly recommend listening to ""Come to Me"", along with ""A Place Where We Belong"" and, ""I'll Find You"".When I saw them, they opened up the show with an acappella ""Now and Forever"" followed by one of the best tracks on this album, ""Shadow of the Sun"" which they merged with the ending of ""Sweet Dreams"". It's hard to find a band that won't dissapoint you, but Russell and Graham never will. God bless y'all"
2,Not Air Supply's best,"I love the music of Air Supply and was introduced to their music by a friend. Oddly it was some of their later music that I was introduced to and not one of thier mega hits. This album fails to capture the magic that previous ones did. Their finest album in mind is ""The Vanishing Race"". Graham has taken over the job of lead singer on this album away from Russell. Russell needs to be the lead singer as he has the more dominant voice. The song writing was mediocre at best. I wish Graham would take outside song writers again and turn the lead singing roll back over to Russell. If your a mega fan you will find this album tolerable if you are just a casual fan, avoid this one."
4,Uno de los mejores LP de Air Supply,"Es un excelente disco, cualquiera que le guste la musica de los 80s, este esta buenisimo Across the Concret Sky, Love is The Arrow, Let me Out, estan muy buenas, todo el disco esta muy bueno."
3,BUEN ALBUM... PERO PUDO SER MEJOR...¡,"CONCRETE SKY .. CONCEPTUALMENTE ES DE LOS MEJORES QUE AIR SUPPLY HA HECHO... PERO A MI ENTENDER, TIENE ALGUNOS DETALLES:1)GRAHAM CANTA CASI TODOS LOS TEMAS.. LO CUAL NO ME PARECE PORQUE.. LO QUE DEFINE A AIR SUPPLY, ES LA VOZ DE RUSSELL. 2)LA VOCALISTA QUE INCLUYERON ES BUENA, PERO TIENE DEMASIADO PROTAGONISMO EN LOS TEMAS... LO QUE DESVIRTUA UN POCO, EL ESTILO DE LA BANDA. 3)NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CON QUE GRAHAM ESCRIBA TODOS LOS TEMAS DEL ALBUM.. DEBERIA HABER CABIDA A CANCIONES DE OTROS COMPOSITORES. POR LO DEMAS, ME ALEGRA QUE RUSSELL HAYA RECOBRADO ALGO DE SU TIMBRE DE VOZ CONOCIDO, Y DE SU RANGO VOCAL... SE PUEDE NOTAR ESTO EN SHADOW OF THE SUN, Y FEEL LIKE SCREAMING .. DOS DE LOS MEJORES TRACKS DEL ALBUM... EL CUAL ES AL MENOS... MUCHO MEJOR QUE EL YOURS TRULY...SINCERAMENTE ESTE ULTIMO, ES PARA OLVIDARLO...¡ SALUDOS...¡"
4,Great toy. Worth the money.,"My kids and I are thrilled with this camper. It's so cute, and has lots of accessories. My 4 yr old plays with it all the time. I highly recommend it. Only downside is that there are lots of small parts, little knives,forks etc. My son is good about keeping it together but it takes a little care not to loose the little pieces."
1,What you see is NOT what you get!!!,"The product pictured is NOT what you get. I bought this toy to get ""people"" and the photo shows a family of 4, but it only came with 2 people. I am so annoyed right now. It feels like the old ""bait and switch"". One person's face paint is all smudged so it looks like she's wearing war paint. This is my first and LAST Playmobil product."
3,The commonest hing,"Unfortunately, this is the only asafoetida (hing) that is readily available in the US. It is preground and mixed with edible adulterants to make it easier to handle. Unfortunately, due to this processing, the quality is not high. While it will certainly work for your recipe, it is nowhere as good as the chunks of pure sap that are harder to find in the US. Search out the good stuff if you know a reputable spice merchant.If you're in NYC, I've found better quality hing at Dual Specialty Store in the East Village. It's still not as good as the super stinky chunks of Afghani asafoetida that I picked up in Varanasi, but it will do."
1,This stuff is NASTY,"I knew what it was when I bought it, but I had no idea that the smell could be so foul. I used a tiny amount in one of my recipes and was unable to eat it. I should note that I am extremely sensitive to odors/fragrance, so that probably has a lot to do with it. I had to keep this little yellow jar enclosed in a glass canning jar with a tight fitting lid so that my kitchen did not smell like a rotting corpse. When I finally gave up and threw it out, I had to throw out the canning jar too, as the rubber seal on the lid had picked up the smell."
3,Excellent Buy But Would Be Better With Glass Lids,"This is an excellent product,however, it would be more useful if glass lids were included or could be purchased separately."
4,Good Value and Performance,"I've been using these pans for several weeks now and I've so far had no issue with them. Food seems to cook evenly and the pans heat up in an average time.I would recommend these for anyone who is looking for a non-stick everyday cookware.The only downside to this product are the rivets for the handles are on the inside of the pan. When cooking scrambled eggs, food will collect around the rivets. Not ideal for sanitary reasons if the pan isn't cleaned throughly. However it makes the construction sturdier."
2,Read the standard Oracle documentation instead,"No need to buy this book, just have a lookat the Oracle Database 10g Documentation."
4,Very good overall coverage,"This book is very useful if you want to get overall coverage of data warehousing related features in Oracle 10g. The book does not covers any topic in details but does covers all areas (SQL, Utilities, OWB, Discoverer, ODM) related to the DW/BI space."
2,Nice presentation but...,Nice presentation of the Oracle products and features in the area of data warehousing but TOTAL lack of real world examples.For someone which is new in this area it may be interesting to discover all the new features provided by Oracle. But to someone having already some years of experience I wouldn't recommand this book.
2,oracle datawarehousing,In our IT dept.We are developing a data warehouse project.I thinkinstead of buying this book read oracle database 10g release 1(10.1)part no:B10736-01Almost the concepts are the same .Lots of information but not a real project example:I mean the book consists of lots of queries but has noa real example.
2,Dull book about a comic genius,"It's hard to believe that someone could write a boring book about somebody as funny as Art Carney,but Michael Starr did it.I had to struggle to finish the book.You get almost no sense of what made Carney a comic genius.Starr instead prefers to write at length about Carney's drinking problem and depression.Frankly,it got tedious after awhile.You'll noyice that there's been only one other review of this book in the 3 years that it's been out.Other reader's must have followed the old maxim""If you can't say something nice,don't say anything at all."""
4,"Director, Fusion Standards",I have reviewed this book thoroughly and found to be useful and excellent for scholars. It treats the subject matter with ample algorithms and process diagrams which will be helpful for implementers.
3,"Good idea...but, it all falls apart in the end","Well, the only thing i can say about this film is that its an odd duck. However, it was a very good idea for the movie, but, it just truly fell apart as soon as it began. Bad directing, bad acting, bad story and plot and making the whole movie look like a rush job, is what truly ruins the film, but, like all cheese horror it is a plus to many fans out there. The Alternate ending does not ruin the film, in all honest, you have to watch the alternate ending in order to ""understand"" the whole movie. However, just a note before you buy, this movie has the title ""Zombie"" in it, doesn't really make the movie a ""zombie movie"", in other words, it is but it isn't. I give this movie 3 1/2 stars for at least trying and you should rent it before you buy it."
3,gruesome zombie flicks revenge,"The price is right on this one. It's a french zombie flick , frances first gore flick from 1986. The violence involving genital mutilationboth a male and a females units, kept this from hitting the grind house circuit back then. This made the movie controversial in it's day. In 2004 or so another even cheaper american zombie flick that went straight to dvd had a similiar scene. Revenge is a very low budget flick but it's not all that bad as they go. After all if you don't expect alot of these low budget horror movies then you won't be dissapointed. The alternative ending changes the whole idea of the movie. but without that ending it's still a zombie flick if you want it to be. And the cool 1980's music is always a plus. This movie is not for young kids though and should be seen by adults only."
4,Reservoir Engineering,This is a book which teaches an Engineer how to practice reservoir engineering in the oil and gas field.
4,"Yes, this is a neat chillout CD...","For all of us who would like to have some background music just to hang around the house... this is perfect music.However, if you're into ""chill music"" for whatever reasons, this will do; just turn down the volume a bit.As a compilation, these discs works well. Between St.Germain, Norah Jones singing Bryan Ferry, and the (now)unfortunately named ""Slow Bombing The World"", you'll be ready for Disc 2.Medeski, Martin and Wood open the second disc with ""The Dropper"", one of their classics.You'll almost finish the second CD (which is very good) with US3 playing one of the most requested songs *anywhere*...Cantaloop (""Flip Fantasia""). Warning! This is *without* the ""biddy, biddy bop...funky, funky...""But between the funky tunes are lo-fi hip hop, a bit of soul, a touch of jazz...this 2 CD set is an awful lot of fun and well worth the money!"
4,"""Smooth Jazz"" for Hipsters","This is a tasty, generous, laid-back sampler of some of the best contemporary jazz out there. Sure, there's a lot of cross-pollination with pop and hip-hop evident here, but that only broadens its appeal. And it's a damn sight better than most of the other ""smooth jazz"" compilations I've heard, which usually come off as Muzak with sax. There's enough funk and cool musicianship to keep it above most of that other pap. There are familiar names here: Norah Jones, St. Germaine, US3, Medeski Martin and Wood, and Cassandra Wilson, with the dash of hip-hop provided by Guru (from his intriguing ""Jazzmatazz"" project) and Soulive. And there are some ""classic"" jazz artists too, like Stanley Turrentine, Donald Byrd, Grant Green, and Julie London (!). All in all, it's indeed a chillin' mix, great for background, parties, or late-night listening."
1,find another book,"I'm not sure if the other reviewers have a different outlook on travel, but I found this book to be completely useless. The writer couches critiques without telling you explicitly where to go and where to avoid. I found the book extremely frustrating. For example, one seedy place that we had planned on staying was truly miserable - the book describes it as ""your best option"" in this part of honduras... In my mind a guide should do just that - guide you to the good and help you avoid the bad. This book just fails to give you the straight facts."
1,Fake,"I've had an ear blockage for a while now, and after reading he glowing reviews on this product I thought, what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I burned one in my ear, the other by itself as a control.-Imagine my elation when I cut open the candle from my ear to find gobs of orange-brown wax inside. It worked!-Imagine my despair after I cut open the control candle to find... the exact same orange brown wax.-Imagine my anger when I realize I had been scammed.Don't trust the positive reviews folks, they are either shills for the company or have never performed a simple test to determine the legitimacy of the product."
2,YES--finally found them but not what I expected,"I've used these for years and my supplier (a local health food store) went out of business and I couldn't get them any more. I was so happy to finally find them again. I've used many types over the 15 plus years I've been candling ears and these, by far, are the best. THANK YOU for carrying them.I wrote the above review before I received them. Now that I have them and have used them I'm disappointed. Apparently, somewhere along the line, they started using paraffin instead of the beeswax they had been using. They burned VERY fast so be careful."
5,Bang for your buck!,This was such a great deal. These earcones are large enough to get everything out of your ears in one sitting. Great price and free shipping on my order. How does it get even better than that? I would definitely recommend these.
2,Case,"Although the thought of a protective case was very smart, the fact is that this case seems too bulky. After a couple of days of using it I just decided to go without."
3,Good case but w/ drawbacks,"The case itself is very durable. It has a couple drawbacks. I cant plug the Zen adapter all the way in unless I maneuver the case a bit to fit it in. If I dont it comes unplugged occasionally when going over bumps or corners( I used my zen for my car stereo) The other complaint is that being a flexible case, the screen that is inside of it comes out very easily, it only stays in with two hinges on the bottom, which constantly move around and maknig the screen useless;"
3,GREAT BUT FOR THE PRICE,"THE SKIN CAME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. THE SCREEN PROTECTOR ALWAYS HAD AIR BUBBLES. WASN'T WORTH PUTTING IT ON. THE BACK BUTTON HAD SOME PROBLEMS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD LOOSEN UP SINCE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME PUTTING THE SKIN ON. THE SKIN WAS A LITTLE TIGHT. THE STAND IS A BIT FLIMSY AND SHAKY. AND THE BELT CLIP IS QUESTIONABLE, HOW DO YOU PUT THAT THING ON? OVERALL ITS OK SINCE IT DOES PROTECT THE SCREEN AND THE SKIN FEELS NICE IN THE HAND. IT'S SMOOTH AND NICE LOOKING. BAD THING IS THAT IT ATTRACTS DUST. WOULD RECOMMEND IT BUT YOU GET FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
3,not item shown in pictures...,"this is a decent product. I thought $9.99 was a great price for what was shown in the picture. A nice sturdy looking case w/a nice screen protector. Well, the case is alright but you get a flimsy screen protector...not the flip up version shown in the pictures. I'd have paid no more than $5 for this knowing that.So.... 3 stars for the case protector0 stars for the screen0 stars for having pictures of the ACTUAL product.5 stars for the armband - it does the job tootoo bad Amazon doesn't have 1/2 star ratings, oh well...I'll just round DOWN!"
3,Pretty flimsy,"Product is marginal. Very flimsy plastic. If you put an armband through the slits to attach to arm, any significant movement and the player flops all around. You get exactly what you pay for."
2,Silcone cover for mp3 player Zen,Was missing a piece that allows you to use the belt clip.I still can use it to protect the zen player but i cant use the belt clip which was 1 of the main reasons i chose to purchase it in the 1st place.
3,IT's OK but not the best.,Pretty Much the only thing that you can get from this is screen and sratch protection. I have also noticed that when it is put in anything fleece it easily takes on lint that never comes off. i recomend this only for those who need there MP3 player protected from scratches.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. BUYER BEWARE,"I bought this product, in the hopes of stopping my player getting more scratched than it is now. there are no good points too this product. The cover does not fit the player properly. The cover covers the earplug hole partly restricting usage of this port. The hinges of the plastic screen protector won't fit into the holes as the case won't stretch far enough.I tried to turn on my player while the case was on it, but the player wouldn't turn on due too all the buttons being pressed down at the same time, by the tightness of the case.If I could give this negative rating or even a zero I would do this without hesitation."
4,"Love the protector, could do without the rest.","The protective skin is perfect. It fit over the device without any problem, and it has already provided good protection to the screen and body of my zen. As a comparison, my cell phone which I've carried in my pocket for the last two years looks like it's been run over by a car - I think with this skin the zen will hold up better. The screen protector is a nice touch.The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty. The belt clip is suspect- it's too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with. But the skin allows me to put the zen right in my pocket without digging out a protective bag or other cover. The skin alone is worth the cost."
3,Creative Zen Rubber Cover,This item protects my player very well. It provides great access to all areas of the device without obstruction. The only negative is its screen protector. It creates glare and and has a small imperfection on it that distorts the screen image.
5,Exactly What You Want,"This is a very durable, extremely protective case. The viewing window cover is great, doesn't mess up the screen in the slightest. The controls are all easy to use thru the silicone and it protects great. I even dropped it from my motorcycle going about 15mph and you couldn't even tell.Kickstand is fun while at the office altho you can't use it when syncing (but all cases are like that). Has a nice feel in your hand. It will make the unit too large to fit in a cradle, so I don't use a cradle and honestly haven't missed having one."
2,Protective? Yes. USEFUL..no!,"PROS: Good protection, arm strap is so-so CONS: Adapter doesnt hold when rubber case is on, belt clip is garbageVery good protection; a purposely done drop yielded no changes or injuries.Thats IT for the good though: the adapter piece slips out VERY EASILY when you want to charge or add music. The flip up screen wont sit flush, which makes the rubber underneath stick up or it lays clumsily on top. There are no holes to let the natural light from the buttons show through...and most importantly..that FREAKIN BELT CLIP DOESNT WORK! It will NOT stay on. It doesnt even fit...the circle on the front of the belt clip is supposed to fit between the two side bars of the kickstand thing. The circle thing is not even big enough to touch both sides.Buy it if you want that rubber protection; but if you want to strap it to something (like for exercise), it can only be your arm."
3,Does its job,"The case was of questionable quality, but the arm band and hard plastic screen protector left much to be desired. On the upside, I have dropped my Zen several times and the case kept it safe."
2,"Ok, but don't run with it...","It worked decent, but the first time I tried to run with it, the film screen protector fell off during my run, which I didn't realize until I'd returned home. So I guess I'll try to find something a little more durable for jogging."
2,Tight fit for 60GB,"this case is a really tight fit for the 60GB Zen Vision M, but i'm sure it would fit the 30GB model fine. the case fits too tightly to operate the buttons, since it keeps them matched down. i'm going to try to stretch it and see if it will get better. if it ever gets stretched enough, the screen protector will be a nice feature of the case, which is one thing i was looking for."
1,Does not fit player by a long shot,"I completely agree with another reviewer who said this does not fit the Zen Vision M correctly. I thought maybe because I have the 60GB version, it was too snug. But Amazon and Creative's website both list the 30GB and 60GB versions of the Zen Vision as having the same dimensions. If that's true, I'm not sure what player this case is meant for. It certainly doesn't come close to fitting the 60GB.The case is so snug it bows visibly around each opening, bends the power button to the side, and would barely allow you to hook into the headphone jack. It's so tight that all of the buttons are depressed at once by the case, rendering them useless. The screen opening bends open so far that the plastic flip screen will not hook into the slots for it, and just falls out feebly.Basically, this case does not come close to fitting properly, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. It's straight garbage. Do not buy it."
3,Creative Zen Vision M Silicone skin,"This is a great product for the 30 gb size Vision but is too small for the 60 gb size. I had to cut slits in the sides to allow enough room so that the buttons are not constantly pressed. Without the slits you couldn't even turn it on without taking it out of the skin. If the buttons are pressed when you are trying to turn it on, it won't turn on. The plastic screen cover is useless for the 60 gig since it won't stay on. I can't comment on that feature for a 30 gig model."
4,Zen Silicone Case Review,It works wonderfully to protect my Zen. I love the little stand in the back. The only con is that the charger doesn't fit securely with the case on.
3,Does What It is Supposed To,"This case is a good value and will protect the screen from scratches and the player from falls. Using it is a trade off though: It makes the biggest, bulkiest mp3 player in recent memory even bulkier.If you love your Zen and size and style is not a concern, by all means buy this case because if you were to drop it and damage it, Zen Vision: M's are hard to find nowadays. For most people though, the Zen Vision: M is an out-of-date product that is reaching the end of its life-cycle, and dropping and breaking it would just mean they could buy a newer, smaller, flashier Zen Xi-Fi or a Zune."
4,Good Protection,"A little struggle getting the player in the sleeve. It's a nice fit and it's a good feeling to have the player protected. No instructions, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, you have to unscrew the belt clip and insert in the case hole. Of course, didn't realize this until after I put the player in the case.Overall good. Like the screen protector and the plastic flip window for that added protection. It's a big investment so it's worthwhile to purchase this for the protection of the player."
1,No Good,Well i bought this product and well it was a black one it kept collecting all the dust around and even worse the belt cilp there was no place to put it without making some type of mark on the Zen also the case itself expands so i was really dissapointed with this buy as for now i now have to go and find something else!!
4,Better than anything creative has made for the Zen:M,"This is actually the third case I purchased for the Zen:M player. I returned the other two (made by creative) because they offered absolutely NO protection.It is easy to get on/off and it fits the player well. However, when the plastic screen cover is inserted it does push the silicone away from the player making it less snug. Also, after I put the screen in the case ripped right where the tabs fit.This case is much more slick to the grasp than I expected. The thickness of the case is just thick enough to make using the center forward/rewind button a but difficult.This case offers a great deal of protection giving an owner confidence while carrying it around. I haven't taken it out of this case yet, so I do not know how many scratches may exist because of dust getting inside the case."
4,I like it.,"I like this cover. It fits well, and protects my Vision M. The only challenge is that I don't know how to put the clip on. It's not a big deal, because I have not had the occasion to need it yet."
3,"Decent, but Dated","Although some of the information contained in the book is relevant to the industry today, I always find it a little frustrating when a book from 6 years ago can be given some new cover art and presented as up to date.Bottom line here is that the editor has not even felt it necessary to update relevant statistics that are quoted and only infrequently has added new content. If you are happy with information that was new 6 years ago, then this is still a good source of information."
4,synopsis,"Proud and beautiful, she would be no man's prize! To the victor the spoils...Offered as the delectable prize at a jousting tournament by the King, the proud and beautiful Lady Eloise Gerrard is far from gaining the freedom to command her own destiny that she so ardently desires. Shocked to discover the King has every intention of winning the prize for himself, Eloise turns in desperation to the challenger. Sir Owain of Whitecliffe had once awoken all her youthful passions...and then heartlessly deserted her. Can she truly now wish to see him the victor - the conqueror laying claim to his prize?"
5,symbolic star,"its a worthy listening, politacal motivating for those amid a strugle. but for those driving in a highway is a symbol of hope and home-coming because is unequically explicit, just telling like it is."
5,the big question,"This has nothing to do with the album, but I just want to make a statement: I don't think Tupac's dead. I wouldn't be surprised to see outrage when people see this, but for me, that's the big question right now. I love Tupac and his albums, but I seriously don't believe he's dead"
4,2Pac 4 Sure,"As an older person, I try to keep up with what's going on in the music of our youth because that's where the cutting edge really is. I like this CD because it is reflective of a real world. A world that has sadly remained basically unchanged since my youth.The CD could have been condensed into one CD rather than 2. Sometimes, my impression is that the compilers throw too many pieces into the mix regardless of quality.But there is warmth, humor, anger and a lot of other stuff packed in this release. I enjoyed it and memorized some of his hooks because they are very poetic. For example, ""Quick to smile juvenile..."" These rhymes have strength and comjure other images. Tupac was very good and this CD is, too."
4,MaKaVeLi Da DoN 4 LiFe,"This album is definetely 2pac's worst album after his death besides the albums that eminem produced for pac and nu mixx klassics (But its still a good album). The first disc has good songs like ""Open Fire"", ""R U still down"", ""I wonder if heaven got a ghetto"", F*** all y'all, and ""let them thangs go"". The second disc has good songs like ""Ready 4 whatever"", Fake A** B******, ""do for love"", ""16 on death row"", "" I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (Hip Hop Version), ""When I get free 2"",and the best song on the album ""Only fear of death"".The album has some dissapointing productions but when pac starts it dont matter. His voice for me can be basically played over anything. Some other great albums are ""Me against the world"", ""All eyez on me"", and ""Greatist hits"". I've heard of the new album that came out internationally called ""Ready 2 die"" Jan 31. But united states didnt get it, cant wait til it comes.ALL I GOTTA SAY IS MAKAVELI IS THE BEST FOR EVERR.I.P."
2,my least favorite 2pac album,"this was my least favorite 2pac album. that doesnt mean it wasnt good. it was. but i thought it was a dissappointment. some of the songs were pretty whack. there were a lot of songs that i really liked. disc 1 contained most of the good songs like open fire, r u still down, where do we go from here, ... i wonder if heaven got a ghetto, nothng 2 lose, and my favorite on disc 1 hellrazor. that song was deep and real. disc 2 songs were pretty bad with the exception of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix, when i get free II, ... enemies with me, ready 4 whatever and my favorite only fear of death. i think i would have been better if 2pac hadnt of changed his voice like that. when i first bought it i listened to it for about a week then i went back listening to other 2pac cds. overall i think afeni shakur did a poor job producing the album. i think if suge knight had produced it with her it would have been A LOT better.by 2pacs #1 fan"
2,This Had To Happen Sooner or Later.,"Finally Tupac Shakur has came down from cloud 9, only this has happened after Tupac Shakur has actually visited cloud 9 (Heaven). This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac's early work, most tracks were made around the times of ""2Pacalypse Now"" and ""Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..."", and it shows. Although Tupac (as always) comes with it lyrically (for the most part), this album - like his old albums, suffers from poor production. But this LP is still a solid buy, it is just below average overall as an LP. Records like ""Do 4 Me"" and ""I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto (remix)"", alone are an overwhleming excuse to buy this album."
3,Aiyo,"This albums ok. I got it day it was out, cuz i was a pac fan before he died, unlike 60% of his fans now. But this was the best album that was released after he died. I love ""Hold On Be Strong"", "" When I Get Free 2"". ill tracks right there. Im sick of these new cds tho, they should just stop. I mean, Trick Daddy and Pac?! I like trick, but damn, Better Dayz was...well, the only good tracks were the Outlawz tracks!"
2,What the...?,"This is a bad 2pac album. Do 4 love is the only good song. There might be one or two others that are salvageable, but if you don't already have this CD, don't rush out and buy. Don't mistakenly think it will make a good X-mas gift for someone. They will be thouroughly disappointed."
5,Damn good CD!!!!-A must buy,"I can honestly say that i enjoy this CD as much now as when i bought it in '97- this CD is HOT!!! I have CDs where i skip past traks when i listen, but this one, i just listen all the way through. A must have for Tupac fans!"
3,3.5 Stars,"R U Still Down is one of the best after life 2Pac albums that anyone has put together. It is a hard listener but the overall talent that he must have put into making that much material before he died deserves enough respect, but overall R U Still Down is a must have."
5,L.A.P. (LIFE AFTER PAC),"I read some review where people said it was rushed. Tupac wrote these songs before he died. These songs were never altered, sold, poluted, or reprised by any other producer/artist. Eminem never got a chance to add his voice or 50 cent's to a song or album. I believed it was somewhat of a cry from the grave, or in a sense final words to poets and fans alike, who could benifet from his wisdom. This album is not be appreciated for its abilty to entertain a club or crowd. And not all rap albums arent supposed to. I believe this album to be the true voice of Tupac after his grave. It is familier of his ""Me Against the World"" album. I urger anyone who is looking for a cd to bump in their car, play at a party or while cleaning their house TO NOT BUY THUS ALBUM, But anyone who wants to know what Tupacs real future for his music to do so! Please lets not poision his legacy lets uphold it."
5,poetry,"If any one ever asks you what poetry means tell them to buy this album. all the songs are tight, even though pac wrote songs within 5mins and the beats he went over were not great just goes to show what talent he had. Clasic songs are nuttin to loose, open fire, and only fear is death...go buy it"
4,A winner first time out of the chute!,"Author Claire Hamner Matturro has put together a winner in her first novel. Bringing her journalistic knowledge, legal writing skills and insight into human nature together, she has created a protagonist in the form of Lilly Rose Cleary that will likely last through several sequels.Alternatively exhibiting inner strength, self-doubt and a prickly sense of humor, Lilly is the type of character where most readers can find a component that matches their own psyche.The book is short enough to be read in a weekend or a few evenings and lighthearted enough to leave the reader feeling satisfied with the effort. With a few autobiographical splashes thrown in, Matturro adds realism. Can she carry it forward to future editions as personal experiences fade and Lilly's character becomes more complex? I'm betting yes!"
4,"""Dead"" On","I had the author as a law school professor and also have a lot of first hand knowledge about insular Florida legal communities. Those who share a similar background will have the most fun with Claire's novel. The author actually lived this stuff as a P.I. litigator in a respected Sarasota insurance defense firm; not that the plot isn't fictional, but the law firm culture depicted in the novel is something you have to experience to write about this way. Law students thinking about doing P.I. should read this first. Nice going, Claire. You passed golden handcuffs on the side of the road without slowing down."
3,Review,"Very informative material, however the presentation is somewhat dry and tedious. Could not finish the first DVD in one setting. It will take me awhile to get through the series."
5,china panda,This purchase as with all my purchases from Amazon was without a hitch If there ever is a problem I notify you and it is corrected immediately Thank you for your great service
3,"Beautiful looking, but somewhat slow-moving","After noted adventurer and wildlife researcher William Harkness dies in the field in 1936, his socialite wife Ruth (Maria Bello) leaves New York and sets off for the mysterious bamboo forests of China, where she dares to take up the expedition and disprove the commonly held belief that the Giant Panda is a fierce and dangerous predator. Made for the IMAX screen, this movie was filmed on location using real pandas, including several adorable cubs. Based upon the memoir by Ruth Harkness, The Lady and the Pandas.Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Disappointing,I was realy disappointed with this CD. More than half of the tracks are songs or skits that aren't even funny. I am a big Chris Rock fan and I've heard many of the jokes on other albums. Even die hard fans should stay away from this CD.
2,Not so good`,"I am a big Chris Rock fan but this has to be his worst cd he has ever made, this cd doesn't even start to compair with roll with the new or Born Suspect. He did have some really funny parts in here but if you are out to buy a Chris Rock cd I would go with Born Suspect or Roll with the new."
4,"""Definetly original and fresh,.......DA REAL!!!","Chris Rock continues to bring the humor, to what other wise may be socially depressing. Let's remember trials and tribulations in retrospect can also be humourous!"
2,Quite a disappointment,"After seeing the stand-up special on TV, I had high hopes for this album. There were parts of it that had me in tears from laughter. Too bad none of them are included on this album. ""Table Dance"" and ""No Sex"" are, in fact, the only bright points from the album and each one accounts for one star of the rating I gave it. I'd expected better, especially after hearing ""Roll With the New"" (a six-star if there ever was one), but it seems that he just couldn't deliver. Even the quality of the sound isn't up to par here; his stand-up tracks sound like you're listening to a twenty-year old tape deck. The only comfort I can take is that his next one will be better. It certainly couldn't be much worse."
5,good so far from what i heard in the samples,i thinkit is funny from what i heard so far i might have to go out and buy it from turquoise
2,save your money,"Too bad there is not a such thing as CD recycle, this would or should be the trend setter for such a cuase. It is terrible, Chris Rock a his worst. If you hate it when you waste money then stay clear of this one."
2,Not what I'd hoped for...,"I am a big fan of Chris Rock and have seen him live (he's amazingly talented, worth every penny). I was disappointed in this CD for the arrangements chosen as well as the sound quality, which is very poor. You can barely hear the audience laughter, and it sounds like Rock is shouting through nearly all of the routines. I personally was not found of the ODB inclusions/Fly Girl Nerd Boy stuff because it felt like SNL skits and took away from the stand-up. I will buy Chris Rock again, but I do not recommend this CD."
3,Origami Paper,This is a great product and my only complaint isthe disription does not tell us how many sheets there are in a package.
3,"Songs from ""Loving You"" by Elvis","The best known songs from the movie are great, but I could do without some others that are on the album for who knows what reason."
3,"Okay, but not completely satisfying.",It's okay. Some of the choices are a little hokey. I was expecting something with a more consistent elegance of voice.
4,A Good Read,"I don't normally write book reviews but the subject matter of the most recent review (see below) has provoked me into a response. The Congress of Vienna in which the shape of post Napoleonic Europe was determined was from September 1814 to June 1815. It is important to understand that the congress was organized to ""settle"" things after Napoleon went into exile on Elba in 1814. It continued through the Hundred Days that ended at Waterloo. The egregious error cited below is not an error at all."
2,having some trouble,"I add this product every week per instructions and find that my dogs waste is not degrading. The unit is full and I have doubled the amount of powder and water I am adding and it is moving very slowly. My sister has the same unit and hers is fine...perhaps it's user error? Still, I think I'll try Rid X in future."
5,Nosotros los Pobres/Ustedes los Ricos,This is a great classic mexican movie. Even if you do not understand spanish you will be able to appreciate real acting and singing! Pedro Infante was the BEST!
1,Don't Buy Sony Products,"Sony products are garbage. A $200 player that breaks after 2 years, almost to the date, and costs $130-170 to repair is a joke. Sony should be ashamed of themselves.I have Pioneer and Toshiba equipment that I have been using for 10+ years, that has never needed anything. A DVD player that breaks after 100 uses is trash."
1,Don't buy this DVD Player,"I own many Sony products (TVs, Walkman, etc..) and most last for years without any problems.This DVD player stopped recognizing DVDs about 1 month after the warranty ended. I called Sony, who basically said all I can do is send it in for service, which according to Sony, would cost more than a new DVD Player. I pointed out that many other people have had this problem, and that the design is defective. They had ""no comment"".I'm going to buy a different brand DVD player and will think before buying Sony again."
5,"With the right firmware, this is the best of the bunch","I spent a lot of time shopping around for this player, after having a really bad experience with a Panasonic unit.Sony did have a problem with lipsynch on units with some units which had a firmware rev < 1.21. However, most recently-shipped units seem to have resolved this problem, and in most other respects this is a first class unit.Plus, if you do have problems, Sony seems the best-equipped to resolve them in a timely manner. The Pioneer 525, which also seems to have occasional lipsynch problems, still has no firmware upgrade. And Panasonic builds crappy machines which are prone to failure."
5,Because I had to go with Sony,"Had to go with Sony, along with my telly. Haven't had it for long but it's very easy to set up. The quality and integrity are great. Actually paid a little less somewhere else, but Amazon's price is not bad. It's hard to go back to VHS--it's so nice not to rewind!"
5,My First DVD Player,"So cool! Soooo much better than vhs (you already know that). Lots of funtions with a good programmable remote. I love this thing, the frame by frame is dope, two fast foreword/back speeds. All kinds of setup manipulation etc. Blows doors on the DVD plaver on my PC as far as funtionality. I watch it through the Sony 27"" KV-2727S46, BAMM!!!"
4,A little nervous,"On 2/4/2000 I received the Sony DVP330 for my birthday, I have only used it a couple of times so far and I love it I have not had any problems with it so far, but I have read a couple of other reviews on it and some people have had to return it at least once or twice due to a sync problem with the audio and actors voices on screen. I hope I don't expierence this problem, but I am still a little nervous."
4,Save your money for the Sony DVP-S360 now available!,"The Sony DVP-S360 is the replacement model for the Sony DVP-S330 (which has been discontinued), Amazon hopefully will get this player in soon and the universal price everywhere for the Sony DVP-S360 is $249. Also all the problems reported with the 330 has been 'fixed' by Sony (as they claim) with the new 360. Also even better than the dvp-s330 is that the dvp-s360 comes with component video outputs and a custom parental control for up to 50 DVDs, so you can program what DVDs your kids watch. Also its thinner and a different more refreshing look than the DVP-s330."
1,sticks on every 5th dvd.,My S330 is sticking/stalling on the later chaptersof about every 5th rental dvd. The DVD's do not appear scratched. The store then is able to play over the point where it stalls on my machine (they have a different brand dvd player).
2,this one too has the LIPSYNC problem; otherwise GOOD,"I bought this DVD player from Amazon and I am currently returning it. Like other SONY DVD players (see reviews for other SONY DVD players), it too seems to have the LIPSYNC problem (doesnt always happen, but it does happen sometimes). I am very disappointed, since I didnt expect such a major problem from SONY products. I am going with Panasonic 120 which is great in all respects!"
1,330 Has Lip Sync Problem,"I just contacted Sony's customer service line and found out that all DVP-S330s manufactured before 8/99 have lip sync problems in random players, so make sure your 330 was manufactured after 8/99 otherwise it's a crapshoot. I'm returning mine now. Strangely, Sony has no recall procedure in place because they claim that not every 330 in the batch manufactured before 8/99 has had a problem. I think they should inform the retailers anyway! Well, at least you know now."
2,Problem with audio CDs,"I bought a Sony DVD player. It played DVDs OK, but it couldn't play audio CD's I created from my PC. I returned this machine and I bought a Pioneer DVD player instead. These CDs play fine on this machine. In fact, these CDs work on my car CD players, my computer CD players, and my 10-year old Yamaha CD player. I was surprised that a new Sony DVD machine can't handle this, since all of these other machines could. Maybe future versions will correct this oversight"
2,"Not DVD, but DUD!","My husband bought the S360 because it was supposed to be a great DVD player. We had the player for just over one year when it stopped playing the majority of our DVD's. The player tells us that we need to Insert Disc, even though the disc has been inserted. We have cleaned the player, cleaned the discs, read all of the troubleshooting literature and followed each guideline. Still this player will only play one of our many DVD's.Our redemption at this point is that we bought an extended warranty and can get it repaired.I've always loved Sony products, but I am very disappointed with this one."
1,"Sony products ""ARE BAD""","One year and DVD player is now a paper weight. After two months had to send in to get fix (150dls), now one year later does not play DVD's says no DVD or DVD dirty. ..."
4,Great starter DVD,"This DVD player is a great value. Haven't had any of the syncing problems yet. CD sound is good. Extremely easy setup. You might get it cheaper elsewhere--but you if you're undecided about DVD, this is a safe bet."
4,Good basic DVD player,"We've had this player for a short time, but it works flawlessly, providing all the functionallity you would expect. This is the low-end model, but the only obvious missing feature is the analog 5.1 surround output. Unless you have a receiver that requires that, don't worry about it. (I firmly believe that the surround sound decoding belongs in the receiver, for use by multiple components.)One thing you can't do with Sony DVD players is play CDs that you make yourself with a CD-R drive. So forget about custom audio CDs and video CDs. You'll need a DVD player with a separate laser for CD playback to use CD-R media."
1,Utter Junk,"I paid 9.50 for the red version, as I didn't want to pay $25 for the alternative. However, this will wind up being more expensive as I'll toss it in a few months, whereas the better one will last for years.This thing is flimsy, there was a flaw in the inner metal and the handle will surely break soon.I'd have returned it but I accidentally tossed the box."
3,GOOD FOR THE BEGINNER,"First you build a cloud is an interesting book with a lot of good analogies. I highly recommend it for 7-10th graders depending on their comprehension level. Adults who know very little about science may also find it enjoyable. It is well written and fun to read. For the experts, leave this one behind."
3,"Good, not great","I went into this book with high expectations due to all the very positive reviews. Though I did enjoy the book, I did not enjoy it nearly as much as I had hoped to. Cole is certainly a very good science writer, but somehow I never got the wonder and amazement that similar books usually impart to me. Perhaps I've already read too much quantum mechanics for laypeople. After the reviews, I was expecting great prose. Cole did unleash a great sentence every now and then, but for the most part the writing seemed pretty ordinary."
3,"Interesting enough, but nothing special","This book tries to explain the wonders of modern physics, from relativity to quarks, for average readers interested in science. Cole has a very lively writing style for a science writer, yet somehow the physics in this book never really came alive or intrigued me, as it has in other science writing."
1,HORRIBLE,"This book was the most boring book I have ever had to read in my entire life. It basically put me to sleep. If i didn't have to read this book for school, I would have trashed it the second I started to read it. This book could not be more boring. True, physics is a hard subject to write about with at least a little part being boring, but BORING should be the title of this book. All i would like to say is: K.C.Cole being a BestSeller author MY A$$"
5,The best for new babies,I was thrilled to receive this from my aunt. I have found that watching this video which gives step by step instructions through the massage to be calming for even me. I have bonded with my daughter and helped her be able to go through her surgeries much more relaxed. What a wondeful gift this was.
1,"Awful, Creepy","As a professional massage therapist and Advanced Doula who has seen several infant massage videos, I found this one absolutely awful. There was no reason for the demo to be done with a nude infant. The instruction was awful. Several of the massage techniques were not soothing to the infant. The creepy guy and the creepy moves he did were unsettling. There are many other infant massage videos out there that are better for parent and baby. Amazon should stop selling this one."
1,I agree with others who find this video disturbing,"I was distracted by the fact that they man couldn't keep the bottle of oil out of the baby's reach. Whenever he let go of her I'd get nervous she'd fall. No matter how quickly he might grab for her, she's covered in oil and could easily slip out of his hands and onto the floor. Then she starts grabbing for the cap, which she could easily choke on. He took it from her several times, but didn't put it out of reach like he should have. She even tried to put it in her mouth. If nothing else, this is a great video of what NOT to do during an infant massage.There was very little instructional content to this video. Essentially, what you see is a 30-something minute, low-budget film of a man rubbing a baby down in oil and trying to stop her from spilling the bottle of oil or falling onto the floor and injuring herself."
3,Kinda blah....,"I suppose that this video wasn't too bad. The two guys in the vid are obviously not actors or are not too familiar being in front of the camera. On the one hand, it is quite instructive and the baby certainly enjoyed the massage. But on the other, the monotone of the therapist ran me out of the room within minutes. I will certainly watch it again and use the techniques on my baby when she arrives. But I may also look at some other videos that aren't so dull."
4,I loved the backstage tidbits on the major stars!,"I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed Gerald Nachman's ""Raised on Radio."" I liked the format: each chapter was laid out by writer's name, his recollections and thoughts on the shows he worked on, and his credits by medium; (radio, TV, Movies, etc). You really got a feel for who was a major talent vs. who was lucky in show business. The writers really didn't get their due from the public, now here's your chance to find out who was responsible for ""making"" certain stars legends!"
2,not much,"If you saw this on a rack in a five&dime; store, you wouldn't pay more than $3 or $4 for it.That said, is is not cheap plastic junk -- it's all metal, except the flip-out 'hangers' and rubber feet. It could possibly hold a 20 x 27 board - maybe even bigger - as long as the ceiling fan's off. It's actually 13 3/4"" standing, 9 1/2"" between the legs.There's not much to it, but maybe that's what you want for travel & table-top presentation."
2,Honest Dogs; Harsh Words,"The real problem with this book lies not in his treatment of his dogs, but in his treatment of other mushers. It is odd that he could be so critical of so many of the other mushers from the back of the pack. While not quite an armchair quarterback, he was definitely throwing some cheap shots from the sled runners. I had a suspicion while reading this book that he was searching for a way to justify his utter lack of speed, instead of just reveling in the moment. While it is nice to hear about a musher that cares deeply about his dogs (as most do), I felt that he simply did not have the rapport with his dogs that most succesful mushers have."
1,sbsbs,"the london production has dated considerably, and the customs tax payable (nearly 13) was exorbitant : frankly, given the original purchase price, the product was just not worth that sort of money."
1,pap,"I can't believe this release garners so many stars from so many people. These are some of the blandest songs I've ever had the displeasure of playing.These guys seem competent but the melodies come off as uninspired and cloying to me. If you like most top 40 fodder, this may appeal to you. I'd recommend the Wannadies, the Posies or The New Pornographers if you seek good pop music."
5,Don't hesitate. Just get this CD!,"I did not buy this CD on Amazon. I bought it in Japan. I listened to it, and, in the next moment, I realised that my hand was in my pocket searching my wallet. Well, there aren't so many CDs making me do ""the unconscious wallet seeking behaviour"". In my opinion, if you like twisted pop like ""Space Hog"", ""Blur"", ""Pixies"", ""XTC"", ""Spooky Ruben"", and such, buying this CD is your next move. I can see your big smile on your face."
4,self-indulgence,"This CD was an extremely slow burner for me. It could be the layered styles of jazz, rap, rock, and pop that seemed so overwhelming at first. But after digging into it, I've become very fond of Breakfast With Girls. A high-energy album, no doubt- and if I'm in a calm mood, the ambience fades into the CDs' driving guitars and poppy vocals. Some tracks resemble Weezer (with vocals/guitars) or Soul Couging (with sampling). But, of course, Self could never be a carbon copy. Breakfast With Girls is a blending of musical food groups, and a refreshing wake-up call."
2,WOW!! DID I READ THE SAME BOOK??,"Dorothy gets kidnapped by Hannibal Lechter and then is kidnappedby the Good Witch (who is on some serious drugs!!) and reunitedwith her rabbit at the end. Go and hug a tree and roll in the mulch,and, then tell me what you think, Grasshopper!! I thought thefirst 130 pages was very, very good---I should have stopped.Too much whoo-hoo-whoo mysticism, communing with nature---WHERE WASMR. MYAGI?? And I quote--from page 261--""""IN THAT MOMENT, THE DISHESHAD BECOME AS WONDERFUL AS THE FOREST."""" C'mon!!?? Oh, c'mon!!I was waiting for the blue lights to set ESTHER'S hair on fire!!That would have been something."
5,Love Pimsleur!,"I love Pimsleur! It supplements my Italian classes and I can use it between class semesters to keep me in practice and learn new things, as well."
3,reviews pump up the book,"The CDs are good but not as good as the reveiws. I have been learning some Italian but the retention is not as good as advertized. Since I purchased a used collection and paid much less than new, I think I got my money's worth."
5,Pretty good gift,"Me and some friends bought this as a gift to another friend. He loved it, so far it looks pretty good quality."
5,A trip for you mind and soul,"Reading Eye of the Albatross is a trip into the air --space filled with poetic descriptions of sunsets, storms, stars. The heroine is Amelia, a Laysan Albatross who has been fitted with a radio transmitter which allows scientists, Carl Safina among them, to monitor where she travels. Her base is Tern Island, part of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. Her flights are mapped for the reader and take her as far as the Bering Sea and the Kamchatka Penninsula. Along the way, various characters are described that make you want to know them. At the end I was pleased with new awareness and sad that this wondrous tale was over. Be prepared to laugh, cry and smile--for a long time."
3,Packaged for export market.,Be forewarned. This is not the pure spice but a watered down mix for the export market. I suppose I can live with that but I would have liked to have known it when I purchased it. I had never heard of this Indian spice before until a recent recipe book by Madhur Jaffrey kept demanding its use. I guess it adds a certain subtle flavoring to the dishes but my palate really isn't that discerning. I think you have to use more than the recipes demand since this is adulterated with a filler.
5,Stinky but makes the dish,"Yes, this spice smells bad! Yes, you do have to keep it separated from your other spices, but, it adds so much flavor and new depth to your Indian dishes that it's so worth the initial odor. Once this spice is added to your pan, it takes on an entire new smell unlike what it is in the container. I use this in my Sambar and have even used a bit in my potatoes and bell peppers for added flavor. You only need about a half a teaspoon because it is strong. Wonderful addition to the Indian spice rack!"
3,Even the packaging is different,"I've yet to use this product yet. It arrived in a 100g white bottle, sort of like a medicine bottle rather than a pack of 2 50g. The bottle seems a little worn, maybe from travel. It also isn't pure asafoetida---I should have read the other reviews. Also the bottle is about 1/4th empty. Hopefully it will work for my recipes though."
3,great addition to recipes,"i have been cooking indian food for almost three years now and i always used to substitute for this unique spice that i can never get in local groceries. my recipes are much better with it however, once you get the spice you should transfer it to a glass jar with a tight fitting lid because the spice does have a powerful sulfer smell before it is cooked. adds depth and complexity to dishes. WARNING: the manufacturers add a lot of filler to this asafoetida like rice flour, gum arabic, turmeric and wheat flour.i will likely try to find a purer source next time i purchase this spice."
5,Yachting is fun,"My son received an Amazon gift certificate for his birthday. He loves Playmobil toys, so I found all the Playmobil toys available and sorted by price so he could find something to buy with his gift certificate -- this is what he chose, and he just loves playing with it. There are a lot of small pieces, so we are careful not to take them into the bathtub or to the beach with the yacht. (Note that even if we do lose pieces, Playmobil has replaced other lost pieces from other sets for us at no charge!)"
3,Robbers On SPOON Street,"I think this is a really good CD, but unfortunately, Robbers On High Street sound EXACTLY like the band SPOON (Austin, TX).I was given a copy of Fine Lines and had to remove it from my CD player and inspect the label to assure myself this wasn't SPOON's Britt Daniel singing! Its uncanny!! That being said, I guess its better that ROHS sounds like SPOON, than say, Limp Biskit of Nickelback.For anyone who's never heard SPOON, try picking up Girls Can Tell, Kill the Moonlight, or the EXCELLENT Soft Effects ep (if you can find it). SPOON's been around for more than 10 years & with each successive release has grown into easily the Best Band in Texas (IMHO).Don't get me wrong -- were it not for them being SPOON-alikes, I think this CD would easily warrant 4+ stars. As it is, I'll give it 3. Still a good CD, just a tad too familiar...I can't wait to hear the new stuff!"
2,Yoga and weights do not mix,"Having been both a yogi and weight lifter for half a dozen years, I had hoped this book would offer a program to efficiently combine the two practices to save time. In actual practice, combining them results in the decline in quality of both activities. They should be done separately where proper focus can be given to the form and intensity of each practice. Not recommended."
2,Too Wordy,"I've been taking yoga for quite a few years now and when I saw Iron Yoga I thought it might be a great way to incorporate weights into my yoga routine. I couldn't have been more wrong. You have to be really advanced to use this book. First you need to know how to do all of the postures properly. Then you have to read how to incorporate the weights and I don't mean a short instruction sentence. These people write a few paragraphs that explain how to do the specific posture with weights. That's just one posture. Good luck trying to get a workout with this book, you'll just end up frustrated.However, I see that there is a DVD available - I would go for that and skip the book."
2,Humidifier pad,It was supposed to be new and the seller sent me a used one--stiff brittle and discolored. I used it anyway but will not buy anything else from him.
5,Honeywell humidifier replacement pad-Excellent quality!,The Honeywell humidifier pad came as a set of two for the same price I would have paid locally for only one pad. It's a high-quality Honeywell part. Very satisfied with the product.
5,Deserves Six Stars,"Like another reviewer, I've had a copy of this book since the 80s. As a kid, I practically memorized this book, and I still think it's finest field guide I own. This book coverage of the most common species is quite thorough. The style and presentation are also excellent, so aspiring field guide writers should take notice."
5,Nice product...,Really great OXO product. Was bought as a gift for MIL and she seems to enjoy it. I like the fact that these refills are available.
2,"Another vote for ""Top falls off""","The glue that holds the green to the blue is apparently not very good quality. The top always falls off prematurely. I would understand it if the sponge was actually getting old, but my last batch lost their tops within a week of being attached.Love the wand, it is perfect for my wine glasses. But get the solid blue tops without the green scrubbie."
1,Badly designed,Do not buy this sponge refill. The green portion falls off after a few washes. Update: I've bought the version that is all blue. It is made of one material and will not fall apart.
2,Inconsistent,"Soap doesn't dispense very consistently at all from the sponge. They are very hit or miss. One sponge might work perfectly, while the next sponge in the same package won't suds up at all. Will be trying something new when this pack runs out."
4,The BEST EVER dish cleaning tool!,"Ok, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I had to force myself to take off one star, because it really is true that the scrubbie part falls off. It falls off. It does. But even if I have to run a band of silicone sealer around the pieces (leave a hole in the middle for the soap to get through!) and glue it back on as other reviewers here have done, it is STILL the best dish wand I have ever used, especially for glasses and jars, and it's still well worth the trouble.I will keep buying refills and keep fixing them and keep using this product until I can't find one anywhere on earth. I love it! In my kitchen this is worth all five stars and then some!"
5,Love The OXO Wands,"I saw one of these wands at my friends house and loved it. I found one in the dollar store, and filled mine with Palmolive lavender dish washing liquid. haha Smells good. The original sponge lasted quite a long long time (it was solid blue) and it's finally started breaking down. I decided one day to see what other things Amazon has beside books, music and electronics :D and searched for these. I was happy to see these wand refills and am back to using it for cleaning bottles and jars.Color is great too!"
2,Can't live without 5 under my sink,"They sure don't last long, but I can't live without them. In an effort to not just purchase a new glass cleaning wand, I keep buying the refills even though they fall apart quickly. I noticed they started selling a wand that is all one piece, since it's the top green part that always comes off."
5,"Finally, the answer to a horrible problem","Dr. Grudem presents the problem of evangelical feminism in a clear, concise, easy-to-read manner. He then deconstructs all of the foolish, illogical arguments you are likely to encounter, and allows the reader to finally see clearly what the Scriptures obviously say."
5,Great Book!!,We received this book in perfect condition. It also came within the alotted time-frame. Great experience.
1,Academic Argument With Personal Attacks,"The surface argument of this sounds academic, but the undertone close to virulent.I have read many books on this position, so I know it is possible to have a viewpoint and even to name names without sounding pompous.His argumentation is very simple. Were he to write a book on all other theological topics, the author's positioned would be widely challenged."
1,Disapointed,I ordered this night light thinking it was cut glass & painted. What I received was a square glass holder with a laminated Chin picture slid between the glass plates. The product looks cheap. I bought the night light as a gift & then decided not to give it away because I was so diaspointed. The description of this product should be changed so that customers know exactly what they are getting.
4,Last of the Summer Wine Spring Fever,"Excellent comedy! This gang is my husband's absolute favorite, he enjoys watching this tape very much!."
1,A total deception,"Despite it looking slick and being pretty well built, this product is garbage. It's supposed to work like an ultra-directional microphone, but you can hear everything around you, especially the sounds closer to you (i.e. your own foot steps, traffic noise) that interfere with those sounds you are aiming at. The ""frequency"" dial is nothing but a volume control. Totally useless."
1,Piece of Junk,"I was so excited to get this to try listening to nature sounds. Instead all I hear is a buzz. You cant hear anything over the buzzing sound. The instruction manual is impossible to understand. After an hour I figured out how to use the record and playback features. By trial and error, the instructions were translated to english and make no sense. Do not waste your money on this. The naked ear works better."
3,"""attack the wack, attack the wack""","the album is ok, but i've just gotta mention the fact that the lootpack uses a sample from the 1979 movie ""Disco Godfather"", one of the more obscure movies i've ever heard sampled on a hip-hop record. i give credit to the lootpack for getting creative in choosing samples."
3,i stay true to the underground but yo...,Lootpack is ill dont get me wrong but the beat production is kind of wack. i wasnt really feeling their beats at all. if you are feeling the west then catch defari or dilated peoples.
5,I love it!,I just love this. Why its not more well known is just beyond me cos its got everything I want from an underground hip hop album.
5,Attack the Wack,"Infectious beats are what this album is all about. Nearly every track has top-notch production. There are also many good guest appearances by Oh No, Medaphor, Kazi, and the Alkaholiks. The Unseen is not surprisingly similar to this album. I owned it first before I owned Soundpieces, and they are both great. I would say to get this album quickly."
5,BUY THIS ISH NOW,"Lootpack is and alwayz will be one of the best hip hop crews out there. Madlib and Wildchild layed down some decent lyrics and roams whipped up some nice cuts. Some tight tracks include : weeded, wheniamondamic, and likwit fusion. There were some dope appearences by dilated and tha liks too. This is a must-get......props to the crewpz.."
5,"Yo! If you don't have this,.. You don't have HIP-HOP","To everyone that has bad reviews about the LP (lootpack). This is truly,the album of '99. Only the headless could put this down, I have never heard anything like this. Madlib is the next Einstien on the boards, Wildchild has to be one the next,... well I can't give him too much. There are too many hard rappers out there. Anywhoo, This is in my arsonal, I think it should be in yours too."
1,Disappointing,"If you're looking for a dvd that will help you to start playing music, give this one a skip. You will hear an unconvincing history of the bass, you will learn how to hold the instrument - described twice. You will learn some finger exercises, the major scale, and two arpeggios, but there is no description of just how these principles are applied to real music, and Phil goes on about how he's saving you time, but his explanation of how he does this is very flimsy. At the end of the dvd, you will not be able to play anything vaguely resembling music, so I'd recommend finding something else to get you playing the instrument.I know I will."
5,Great after a workout,I am 50 and I get tight muscles after I skate. I stand on this and it gets my muscles all shook out and relaxed. I like it.
1,Viewer Discretion Advised,"My son cried several times over the week following our reading this book.Having read hundreds of books to my 4 year old son, I found this one to haveuniquely missed the target audience. This familiar story simply failedto sufficiently reconcile the dog Jack's death.I'm sure that adult dog owners, who have lost a beloved pet, will love it.Unfortunately, this is a children's book. Children need to have such storiespresented is a sensitive, better conceived manner. Admittedly, the imageryand illustration are pleasant, but I can only recommend against this bookto parents."
5,A Well Kept Secret,"After Rain is the only Trevor book I've read, but my first impression is of an unpretentious, master craftsman. He shows how to dazzle while keeping to simple language. The subjects for his stories are both, refreshingly new, and, just around the corner from our own lives. With it's tight construction and expert storytelling, this book goes fast, but at the end of each story, you feel like you're in possession of the most subtle and refined tapestry. What's better is that it always feels like a surprise, since you saw the story unfold so efforlessly and elegantly that the resulting richness and power is unexpected. Each of the stories are awesome in their own right, so it is difficult to have favorites."
1,After Rain by Wm. Trevor,"Sorry to disagree, but I found this book to be full of useless, pointless, boring short stories. Ugh."
1,JUNK,Junk - Absolutely JUNKI have had 2 within the last year the second one going junk just recently. Instead of charging my phone it DRAINS the battery. - JUNK!!!I got the piece of JUNK from a JUNK SAMS Store outlet.I tried to get a replacement --That worked like a snowball in HELL.
3,"Very ""trippy"" movie at the end you will say ""What the %$#$ Did I just Watch?""",If your interested in a movie that will leave you desperate to try and piece together an explanation and reasoning behind what you just watched this is that movie. Think Momento and The Cube mixed together add in a strange anti-climatic ending with very few clues to pull from and you have this movie. Good acting but it was tough to follow and the ending made no sense. Strange. Very strange.
1,pretty darn cheesy,"Although I very rarely do this, after about a half-hour, I found this movie so bad, I ejected it and threw it into the trash. It sounded interesting when I read about it; the title and the art were intriguing, but the movie was just plain bad."
5,Great CD,"At first I didn't know what to make or it. It sounds a lot different than their first album. I can confidently say that the depth of their music and lyrics has gone beyond anything they did on their first album. This album is a much more mature attempt in all areas and is extremely pleasing to the ear. Music is key for me and they do a great job. This album is one you can listen over and over again. It's gotten so bad that some of my friends say I try to sound like Dan Haseltine when I sing. It's purely unintentional. Overall, might be the best album in a long, long time. You won't be disappointed. I even give it away as gifts."
3,"Good, but has some low spots.","I think JOC's new album is missing what made them famous. They just sound different. There are no violin solos in this one, and they add an electric guitar in this record. As far as the lyrics go, they are much more confusing than the first album. ""Tea and Symphathy"" is just bizarre to me. If you are trying to reach the lost unsaved people, why would you write songs that even saved people have a hard time figuring out? I think musically overall this is as good as most albums out there. I think some of the songs in the middle of this album are a little boring. My picks are ""Overjoyed, Crazy Times, Frail and Truce."" This album wasn't bad, but I hope the next one if more like the debut album."
4,Musically excellent-lyrically good,"Jars of Clay is my absolute fave. They have an AMAZING acousic sound that can just take you away. This sophomore album though is a little to abstract. If Jars is saying that they are ministering doesn't that mean that they want their songs to be a blessing? How can a song be a blessing when the majority of people can't even understand it. Don't get me wrong. I still really like this album and their lyrics, but they could be a little clearer with them."
4,Great songs and not-so-great songs,"I must admit that I don't like half of the songs off this CD, but the other half of the songs sell this CD and make it worth the four stars. ""Fade to Grey"" is simply amazing -- I love to sing along with it. ""Overjoyed"" is great too, and so is ""Crazy Times"" and ""Truce"".On the other hand, ""Frail"" is too slow and has way too long an intro. ""A Portrait of an Apology"" goes on too long at the end. ""Much Afraid"" sounds almost identical to ""World's Apart"" off Jars' debut album.I am actually not a big fan of Jars of Clay's first album (unlike most people), so I'd say this CD is much better than it!"
5,I love it!,"The song Fade to Grey is reason enough to buy this album. It's by far the best on the CD, and one of my favorite songs. You always knew Jars of Clay were passionate, moving, poignant, etc., but you didn't know HOW much until you listened to the song. It's a cry for help from someone who's hurting but knows God can help them. Just listen to the clip. You'll like it--scout's honor!"
3,"Good, but nothing compared to their first album.","When I first listened to this album, I was surprised by how different it sounded from their first album. I skipped through all the tracks, sampling each one for half a minute then moving on.I have to be honest, I don't like the new sound much at all. I like more upbeat stuff. Their first album was awesome! However, the first four songs kind of grew on me after a while, especially ""Fade to Grey"" and ""Crazy Times"".Four good songs is enough to make an album, but it's a shame they had to stray from the magic of their first album. I loved the acoustic guitar and the way they incorporated the violin into ""Boy on a String"" and not so much the solo in ""Flood"". I thought songs 1-5, 7, and 8 from the first album rocked. They also have a new lead vocalist. The new guy, I think he did ""Flood"" on the last album, sounds softer and frankly, more feminine. Nevertheless, it's worth getting."
3,This album is confusing,"Good music but hard to understand lyrics like this for example in the song Tea And Sympathy ""Cause it's not the way That it has to be Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy"" what in the world does that mean???. Another reason why I gave this album 3 stars is for one dull song that should have not been on this album Frail. I consider this song a extra like in their excellent first album Jars of Clay song ""Four Seven"" (the hidden track after the song Blind). Rest of album was pretty good except for the confusing lyrics. Buy the first album Jars of Clay instead you definetly like it better. For you Jars of Clay for your next album could you please make the lyrics more understanable thank you from a fan of yours."
3,Didn't Measure up!,"Although the musical style is fun to listen to, the lyrics are difficult to understand... there was no striat-forward, biblical meaning to many of the songs... and that makes it hard to understand. If your an abstract sort of person, maybe you can decode this one better than I did... Their first release was much better (and much easier to understand) I purchased this album within 48 hours of it's release (hoping it would live up to my expectations) and it just, didn't. Much afriad just sits on my bookcase... because I don't listen to it all that much."
4,grows on you,"When I first got this CD, I didn't like it. But it grew on me. Each time I played it, I came to like it a little more. The songs on this disc have a real depth (spiritual and musical) to them. Some of my favorites include the introspective ""fade to grey,"" the soul-searching ""frail,"" the prayerful ""weighed down,"" the bitterly honest ""much afraid,"" and the beautiful ""hymn."" This disc is great for leading yourself into worship or for playing when you're entertaining guests. I recommend this disc."
3,Extremely overrated and not nearly as brilliant as the 1st,"What happened to Jars of Clay? One minute they are praising the Lord in their Jars of Clay CD and the next they're hiding their beliefs except in their songs ""Overjoyed"" and ""Hymn"". While "" Crazy Times"" is frankly enjoyable I could not see the point of it at all.This album fell into the Counting Crows category but it's way behind them and Jars of Clay previous release."
3,Good Lyrics,"The first JoC Album was great. I would give it many stars. Although I liked this one, it was not as good as the first. The lyrics are very good, as is some of the music, but I was put back in the beginning when I recognised riffs from other songs by other performers having made there way to this CD, knowingly or unknowingly. Someone in another review heard something that sounded like a beatles song. I heard something like that as well. A co-worker I was listening to it with (a musician) heard something from a Fleetwood Mac song. There may have been more, but it has been awhile, so I don't remember. Judging from the first album, I think they are capable of better.There are some catchy songs. 3 stars is average."
5,I bought this CD about a year ago and I love it!,"About a year ago I bought Much Afraid by Jars of clay.This CD is awesome. It is sooo spiritual; if you are looking for a great CD this is the one for you. The song ""Fade To Gray"" really bugs my step-dad because in a way it is saying that every- body is equal, and nobody is perfect. If we look deep enough you'll see that nobody is black or white but we are all the same color trying to servive in one world together. I have all of Jars of Clays CD and love them all! Thism one is my fave not only because I get to anoy but also because it helps me spread the word of God! The guys of J.O.C did a really awesome job. Jesus Rules!!!!"
1,boring...,"Jars of Clay realize they had a lot to live up to, tried to redo Flood several times on this cd and failed miserably. The addition of electric guitar on this album was misguided at best, removing one of their distinctive traits. The drum machines are still distracting, the vocals are still thin and somewhat whiny... The only saving grace on this album is ""Frail,"" but it won't raise the rating because the song was the title track to their independent release 4 years ago..."
4,Don't compare it to their earlier work!,"I have heard and read many complaints that this isn't anything like their 1st album. While this is true, there is a reason for that. Jars had different intentions with this one and a defferent message. If you stop with the comparisons and look at this one for what it is, you'll see a high quality CD. There are no bad songs on thes album, and Jars has a good mix of slow and fast music. Fade to Grey, Crazy Times, Truce and 5 Candles are particularly good, while the slower Frail, and Much Afraid are excellent ballad type songs, and Hymn is a fabulous way to end it. Once again, the 1st Jars CD was excellent, but don't expect this one to be just like it. Enjoy!"
4,"Good, but the first album was better","I didn't like it the first time I listened to it, but if you give it a second chance, you'll find it very good. Hymn is great! The first album was better. I think I'm buying their next album."
2,"RIght idea, not the best execution","I had one of these a few years back. I attached it to a stationary bike in my fitness room to make grinding out the miles less painfull on my private parts. To some extent it worked, but the seat was never comfortable.For what it's worth, last year I tried a Moon Saddle (google it) from New Concepts. This saddle fit has the support in all the right places and enabled me to increase my saddle time to several hours on day one. I've installed these on both my bicycles and enjoyed about 700 miles of riding during the 2nd half of last summer. I no longer experience numbness down south.If this one doesn't do the trick for you, check out the competition."
5,"Excellent Bike Seat, Great Price, Fast Shipping, Oh My","This is an excellent bike seat. I went off a curb today while on my way back from work (a ten mile mini-commute) and instead of receiving a pelvis-destroying smash from the middle bit of my old seat as my wheels hit the pavement, I comfortably kept riding, incurring absolutely no pain or possible future sterility.Wonderful seat, the product shipped very quickly, as advertised and for a very reasonable price (kind of a steal, actually)."
1,This product was a problem. Es un pesimo producto.,"This item is make with chip materials. It's not easyseat ergonomical. Este producto esta realizado con materiales baratos que se dañaron al momento de instalar. No es comodo, ni ergonomico."
2,Wear a jock!,"I did not like this saddle. I couldn't find a way to be comfortable when riding with this seat. Also, better wear a jock. When you go over bumps it feels like they might fall off!-Ken"
1,"Cheaply made, poorly designed","As someone that has fought my weight from time to time, and started having symptoms of saddle related health issues I purchased this seat. It is really cheaply made, and poorly designed. The plastic does not support that well, and constantly moves and flexes slightly. The biggest design issue is the seat is too long front to back. The hornless seat I ended up liking was short enough that my hip bones can rest comfortably on the seat, and the front does not extent past the crease that separates the top of your leg and your sitting area.There are some good hornless designs on the market that are really well made. This one is not.Just for reference our family of four has 7 different bicycles, a very nice two child trailer, and tag along tandem attachment in the garage that we ride regularly."
3,I had a better seat before.,"I've been using a cruiser with a very upright posture. Commute around 10 miles every day, moderately bumpy path. Since I'm biking over 1hr every day, I'm always trying out new seats. So I gave it a shot. Didn't live up to expectations. I bought it as an improvement over Selle Royal Respiro Moderate Cool Xsenium Bicycle Saddle, but ended up reverting. The Selle Royal Respiro Moderate Cool Xsenium Bicycle Saddle was one of the most comfortable saddles I've had so far."
4,Seat does what was claimed to do -,"I'm overall happy with the seat. Did not feel that it gave specific enough instructions for adjusting. Not sure that I have it adjusted correctly, yet. I would and have recommended this seat to friends."
2,Easyseat,"I chose the seat following prostate survery, was the less comfortable than I anticipated. Went through a local bike shop and tried the Adamo bike saddle which is more comfortable and I would recommend the Adamo to anyone over the Easyseat."
2,Bike Seat,Could not get comfortable using this seat. The was set put too much pressure on legs and never felt right.
2,Very Hard Seat,"I've had this seat for a month now. It's a little odd at first but it didn't take me long to adjust to the ride. I didn't have any trouble with the balance. With no nose, zero pressure on the perineum which is nice but in the end it's an inexpensive plastic seat. Very hard. I rode about 5 miles around town yesterday and very sore tailbones today. I'm searching for an upgrade now. Something that won't leave my tailbones sore."
4,patience required,"I am much more comfortable while riding. Patience is required to correctly adjust the seat, lots of trial and error was needed."
2,Item was returned,"I returned my easy seat. I did not find it comfortable and supportive, just felt like I would fall off the bike."
4,seat performance,"Once adjusted properly, the seat performed as advertised. Like any other seat, it took some getting used to but I'm more concerned with my anatomy than a few days of discomfort. Good job."
1,Hard as a rock!,"I was very excited to receive this seat after reading the reviews. I realized that it was going to take some adjustment to make it work and after several tries found a position that seemed to work. I then went on a 20 mile ride which turned out to be a very painful experience. I couldn't wait to get home and remove the seat! The hornless seat did take the pressure off the groin area but the seat had no padding and was like riding on a rock. It is a good idea but has some bad flaws. I purchased a Schwinn Stress Free Bike Seat, wow what comfort!"
1,Very uncomfortable,"Couldn't really adjust the seat the way I wanted, and wasn't comfortable to seat on. I ended up returning it"
1,"Total discomfort, complete disappointment","The ""Easyseat"" was so uncomfortable I had to go back to my old standard seat. Yes, it took pressure off of the groin area. However, the seat has two serious design flaws.First, the pads are built so that they dig into your thighs (they should be sloped in and in the other direction).Second, the seat rocks as you move. It is slight--maybe 10 degrees or so--but very irritating. I commute in city traffic. Concentration is key. The rocking of the seat made it impossible to focus on what was around me.This seat is, alas, going to be trashed."
1,Cant find comfortable position,"The cushions move too much. They rotate such that the front of the seat can move 1 inch up and down. This seems to be the way it was manufactured, but it makes the whole thing very uncomfortable as there is no way to find a good position on it. Or maybe the one I got it messed up?"
4,Very pleased!,"Bought this seat for my Dad's stationary bike after he had radiation for prostate cancer. His doctor had told him that he needed to stop biking to relieve the pressure points, but with this seat there are no pressure points and he is very happy with it. Installation was a little difficult (it is an older bike), but it did install securely with a little persuasion. Very pleased with the product!"
3,Comfy Seat,"This seat is definitely more comfortable than the one that came with my spinning bike. It takes some trial and error to adjust the seat correctly. You have to figure out how wide or narrow to have the 2 pads. The seat pivots up and down when riding. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your preference. Overall, I am happy with this seat. No more pain!"
2,"It works, but it's cheaply built","First and foremost, I am 6 ft 1 in tall on a large frame. I am over weight not obese. I really think this seat was made for someone of a smaller statue. It did work in getting rid of the numbness in my crotch, however it only lasted three bike rides. Your butt bone rest on two little dimples in the seats. That is what keeps you from sliding off. The seat itself is hard and a bit uncomfortable, but not intolerable. Each pad will adjust from side to side with a thumb screw holding it in place. The problem is the whole pad is kept from sliding off by a plastic plug on the end. Guess what comes out with not too much pressure. Being big as I am, the seat quickly fell apart on me. Someone of a smaller frame might have a better run at it. Anyway the principle works, no pressure in the crotch area mean no numbness. I am giving it two stars for working but nothing more because of the bad design."
3,"Helps the pressure problem, but needs more padding!","I have used this product on my Trek trail bike for about 3 years now. It solved the pressure problem of a conventional seat, but it has practically no padding! I am a thin guy with not much padding back there. Now it feels after about 10 miles like I am sitting on two bricks. It's true that it moves a bit with your body but that didn't bother me. I don't have a problem with balance or keeping the pads in position, but this padding thing has me thinking I should try another seat."
2,Hobson easy seat.....not easy,"Purchased this seat to relieve pressure on prostate and that it did but it was very hard to adjust properly and never felt very comfortable so I returned it. Pressure is all concentrated on your ""sit"" bones in your butt and can be difficult to accept. I returned to my old split center bike seat and adjusted the angle downward more and prefer it to the Hobson. Wish I could have rated it higher but I just couldn't find any comfort it using it."
3,Good for training,"I'm 6'3"" 290, first time out I used this seat on a 30 mile ride (probably not the smartest thing to do!). I used the seat for an additional 2 rides of about 15 miles each. I found the sensation weird and found my balance was way off with this seat. I also felt my hands were under a lot more stress than with a normal seat. On the other hand there was no soreness in the perineum that sometimes occurs after a couple hours on the bike with a normal seat.I had a long ride (5 boro bike tour) coming up so I switched back to my conventional seat. I found when switching back that this seat had taught me how to better sit on the conventional seat so that I got the benefits of both."
1,Didn't work for me,"This seat might work to relieve pressure on the sit points except for it being hinged and each pad being free to move independently. The movement is disorienting and causes difficulty finding center after the many ""get-ups"" during a ride."
5,Great Ergonomical Dual Pad Bicycle Saddle,I bought this seat because of a review that was posted by another consumer. I was not disappointed. It took a little bit of adjusting (just like he said) but it is by far the most comfortable seat I've used. I installed it last night and took my first ever 20 mile ride today. I can feel the pressure (not pain but I knew I was sitting) in the sit area but nowhere else. Wonderful!!! You can adjust the seat in a variety of angels to get just the right position. Because the pads are not stationary a tilt of the hips provides a different position. He mentioned feeling the pads on the back of his upper thigh but I didn't notice that after the first mile or so.
4,Not too hard,"This seat is much more comfortable than the basic seat that came on my Stamina exercise bike. It takes a little time to get used to it, but worth the wait. I've learned to balance on the seat to ride hands free and it's been great for my obliques!"
3,is few uncomfortable but very effective,"if you have prostate problems, or simply are over 50, this seat is really perfect for you: it prevents any painful contact, and allows you to pedal effort only the muscles of the legs and arms.certainly does not allow for a relaxing session, because it requires you to keep both hands on the handlebars, and imposes a sports position, with pressure on the arms, but this position is actually the most beneficial, especially for those suffering from back problems: I have two herniated disc, and the bike gives me great relief."
4,What a relief,"I bought a spinning bike recently and after having to get both a gel seat and a sheepskin cover to make the saddle even remotely tolerable, I finally gave in and bought the Easyseat. I'd had a similar product before many years ago for an outdoor bike, and I have to say it is a great addition to the spinning bike, as it enables me to stay in the saddle for an hour or more with only minor discomfort (which is nothing compared to the full-pelvic numbness I was getting from the old saddle after only a few minutes, in spite of the two layers of padding.) It was even more comfortable after I put the sheepskin cover on it (I used the one I already had, and just put it on sideways.) It takes a little getting used to, and peddling in reverse is a tad awkward, but all in all I have to give this product two thumbs up."
3,Index Tabs that stay put,I could not fine any index tabs at any of the stores I checked including MW. These tabs stay put where ever you put them.
5,A very funny book with a nice moral,"We bought this for our kids in the 70s and read it to them over and over again. The story is cute and children love it, but for adults, the drawings are an absolute hoot!!. Well worth the investment."
2,Poor,"This was listed as in ""good condition"" but it was an old library book with children's doodles, white out(!) and stains inside the book. Very disappointed."
5,Best sausages in the world,"This in one of those aquired taste items. I have more than aquired a taste for them. Try them sliced in small (1"") thick diagonally sliced pieces in fried rice. Yum Yum"
3,Not so small,"This spatuala is made well enough but I was looking for smaller size to use for getting the last bit out of small jars. While this will clean out a mayonaise jar, so will my large spatula that I prefer over this one."
3,"Good quality, but too small","My wife really likes this brand of spatula and that is why I ordered it for her. But when it came in, it was so small you would have thought it was something for my two year old daughter to play with."
4,"Sweet, eco-sensitive","I tend to grade Jewish books, particularly those for very young children, on a curve. Gotta buy 'em, wanna love 'em. And, nu, if they're not fabulous? Adequate will have to do. But this one actually IS good; it's my favorite Jewish board book. The illustrations are painterly and folk-arty, definitely a cut above most books from Jewish publishers. The lesson that Tu B'Shevat is the ""birthday of the trees"" comes through clearly, and there's a nice environmental message about how trees help the planet. Plus it rhymes; my kids strongly preferred rhyming books when they were very small. I'd recommend this title for kids aged 18 months to 3.5 yrs."
1,Stay FAR Away!!!,"Seriously. This is one of the worst produced DVD's ever. I can't watch the movie because the quality is so bad that it's distracting. If you are watching it on anything bigger than a 2 inch screen you will be sorry. The company that put this out (Fusian) should be embarrassed and should never be allowed to put out another DVD again. I only paid a couple dollars for it and I still feel ripped off!As mentioned in the other review they actually put a splitscreen view of the before and after of their ""remastering"" job. It's almost worth buying just to see it because it's such a joke. In fact, it took me a while to figure out which was supposed to be the remastered side.I would like to write about the movie itself as I was looking forward to watching it, but with this DVD that will never happen.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING RELEASED BY THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY (FUSIAN)!"
3,Informative but not what I expected.,"Personally, I have many of Alberto Villoldo's books and I really appreciate what this man has to share with us. ""Healing the Luminous Body"" is very informative in many respects and it would not be a waste of one's time or money to purchase or spend time with it. However, for my own purposes, from someone who works with healing energy, I guess I was hoping for more instruction on how I could apply this information to my healing practice. I really feel that I should watch this again before I make a definite conclusion. Keep in mind that this is my first impression and that it left me bit disappointed. I suppose that I was looking for more hands on instruction. I still love Alberto and will not shy from purchasing anything new he comes out with. I would just like more instruction on how to use the information he gives."
2,Healing the Luminous Body,"A bit shallow I think. It doesn't present Villoldo's work especially good. I've met him on an earlier occasion, and I use his tools in my own practice, but this video doesn't come close to what I think he stands for"
3,interesting video,"There are no directions for healing.. only explanations in a general way about this approach. Nicely done though. Just more general, ad for buying Villaldos books or courses."
5,Wonderfilled,While watching this I went on line & bought several copiesloaned my copy to a friend & she did the same thing... ordered one to own & then others for friendsPowerful images illustrating anchient wisdom
3,Interesting,"If you are new to energy medicine, this may be a great dvd for you, if you know about energy medicine this is a repeat!It is an appetizer to energy medicine, I felt I wanted more when it ended. There are good concepts!"
3,Very Informative and good interviews,"I bought this documentary on a whim, and I thought it was pretty good. I did not know anything about Richie Hawtin and little about the Detroit Techno scene as well. I enjoyed how the film presented Richie through his growing up years and onto Plastikman and then onto the present, the interviews by his parents and friends, and learning about his diehard dedication and hard work to succeed no matter what. The documentary presents plenty of photos from Richie's past. Definitely check this one out!!"
1,missing books,I also wanted to read the two missing books--Anne of the Windy Poplars and Anne of Ingleside. I'm glad to say I found these two books on the Nook.
3,Hummmmmmmm,"I truly admire the instrumental musicianship of Dream Theater. But, I cannot belive they would release a recording with such shoddy vocals. Far too many times the vocalist's intonation was absloutely horrible! Normally I rate the band's work 4 or 5 stars. This time I am generous with 3."
3,Nice Instrumentation but.....,"LaBrie is great on most songs (New Millenium, the songs from train of thought) and overall this is his best live vocal performance without a doubt. But on Pull Me Under and Only a Matter of Time his vocal tone is awful. He for once gets all the notes on Pull Me Under, but his tone on this and Matter Of Time is nasal and annoying. Phenomanal performances by the rest of the band, particularly Portnoy and Rudess."
5,dale jr. halloween costume,"my son loves dale jr so when i happened to come across this costmue while browsing online, i knew i had to buy it for him even though halloween was months away. he loved it! it was also pretty cheap-it wasn'y any more than the costumes they sell in stores. the shipping of the item was really quick. i was extremely satisfied with this purchase!"
3,Volume 2 not much of a bargain,"The good news about the CD reissue of the 1976 album is that there is nothing wrong with the material that is included. If you plan to purchase the CD to replace the vinyl LP, you are in for a surprise. The 14 tracks on the original album are now reduced to 10 on the CD! The 1956 Texas interview, the 1961 presentation of awards to Elvis in Hawaii, ""Blue Christmas"" and the two takes of ""A Cane and A High Starched Collar"" are NOT included. Unless you are seeking the alternate take of ""I Want You, I Need You, I Love You"" (with the reversed lyrics near the end) save your money on this one. With only 10 songs and no track information (the CD does not include the original album booklet) this budget release is no bargain. I am disappointed that RCA/BMG/Sony won't release the four volumes of this series with all of the tracks (as of 2012 only volumes 1 and 2 are available on CD). I would suggest that you seek other offerings that provide more material for the money."
2,def a one time viewing.....barely,"i had never heard of this and came across is in one of those 6 xmas movies for 5.00 so i thought how bad could it be? well...........i do love olivia and thats the only reason i decided to get it and gregory harrison is ok but talk about rushed story and script and no chemistry at all between the two! and olivias own daughter just comes off as this whiny brat who a mother would find hard to put up with. she acts likes she is the mega star in this movie and to b quite frank, if you took her out and just left the other little girl i would have enjoyed it more. as far as xmas magic, i'm sorry to say this movie has none and with soooo many more out there that do i'm afraid i will only b watching olivia in grease or even xanadu before i pop this dvd in again."
4,Old-fashioned love story,"I love this old- fashioned Christmas love story complete with children., farm animals, winter scenes, and a cozy mountain shack and good friends."
3,Not as good as I remember,"This movie was really good when it was first broadcast approximately 20 years ago. While it's still pretty good, I'm not really interested in it any longer."
4,Sweet For The Holidays,"A nice, typically corny movie for the holidays; for the romance suckers who don't need anything deep to watch. Good family viewing when you've got children in the house."
3,Once was enough for me.,"This movie was marginal. It is fair to watch, but not a keeper. I passed mine on. It was a slow movie with an undeveloped plot. The characters had no chemistry."
5,Brand New,"This was brand new and never taken out of the packaging. I took it out, watched it and was very happy with it."
2,Poorly made..annoying...disappointiing,"This movie ""Christmas Romance"" is a poorly made movie. The actors are wasted with such a low budget film. The ""marching"" music is annoying, and the kids and the adults seem to be yelling and arguing throughout the whole movie instead of talking in a normal tone of voice - poor acting. Too bad. I wanted to enjoy this film."
3,A TOUCHING STORY BUT LACKS MAGIC,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Some parts I liked such as the cozy cabin in a snowy country setting but other parts, I was not fond of. First of all, I didn't think that Olivia Newton-John and Gregory Harrison had any chemistry between each other. Also, I have to agree with a couple of other reviewers, some of the yelling an screaming should have been toned down. The other thing I didn't care for was when they show the birth of the lamb in the barn. While I appreciate the magic of a new birth, I felt that they showed too much blood especially for an audience which includes children.It's a touching story but I feel that it lacks magic."
3,I think my expectations were too high.,"I like the actors in this movie, but I felt like the story line did not go far enough. I was disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this Christmas film (great actors), but was disappointed with the poor script writing and low budget it was given. The story had potential. Too bad these two wonderful actors' talents were wasted on stilted dialogue and sloppy writing."
5,a feel good movie,"I love this movie, I had already seen it on tv, and was looking for it for some time now. It will make you believe in magic, and true love."
2,Not too good!,"I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. Bad acting and no ""Chemistry"" make this a movie to avoid."
3,An OK Christmas Movie,"This is a movie that is just fair, in my opinion. I enjoyed it but probably won't watch it again next year. The one thing it had going for it is that the characters do seem to care for the animals in the movie. That is important to me. I wish everyone cared and respected animals more. The world would be a nicer place."
1,christmas romance,My dvd was bad so I only got to see half but would have cost more to send back .Carol
3,Christmas Romance,"This is a nice movie to share with family. A little slow but a good theme. It's hard to see the main characters as a couple, but that is the way it is in life as well."
2,DISAPPOINTED,Great actors!!Great outdoor scenery!!Disappointed with the poor script writing and low budget it was given. The story had potential. Too bad these two wonderful actors' talents were wasted on stilted dialogue!
4,A great family friendly Christmas film,"I've enjoyed watching this each Christmas for awhile and was quite happy to find it available on DVD.It's a charming story of a young widow trying to make ends meet and the banker who arrives just prior to Christmas to foreclose on her home. The story revolves around him getting stuck at her house in a snowstorm and coming to know her and the children.She's clueless about finances and he has to learn about caring for others instead of finances.Okay, it's a corny Christmas movie but it is the kind of story that warms the heart and we can use those stories all through the year. It's also the kind of movie you can pop in the DVD player with the kids and a bowl of popcorn to enjoy as a family."
5,Heartwarming,"A good heartwarming movie, a surprising turnaround of a difficult situation. A hardworking Mother trying to get by. Definitely worth watching."
3,It was an ok movie...,The movie was ok but not really very good acting at times. It was kind of cheesy as my daughter explained it. It could have been better but some things were just kind of corny.
2,hopelessly hopeless,Had high hopes with Oliva and Gregory but after 15 minutes had to turn it off..it was just plain silly with substandard acting and /or directing
4,nice,was expeceting a bit more from it i guess... but enjoyed it on the hole... may watch it again later on
4,A Christmas Romance,A Christmas Romance Movie - I love the holiday seasons and this Christmas Romance in a rual setting with the modern twist is great. I love the animals and some of life's hard lessons of lose and love.
5,A Christmas Romance,"This movie is a must see for anyone who is a romantic. It has everything. Drama, songs, and of course romance. It is a wonderful movie."
3,Not a happy happy movie,"This movie has beautiful outside scenery shots and the little girls have a lot of charm. There are some funny moments in the movie. Don't get fooled by the smile or the title that this is a happy happy movie or a romantic one. In most part the mom is down because of the hardships that have befallen on her and the one daughter is sad. It is for the most part a clean family movie.It is good to remember the ""peace on earth, good will towards men"". As far as the musical c.d., don't expect to be hearing O.L.J. sing the songs."
4,Christmas title,It took a while to get it in but it is very popular and was in good shape. We had ordered several titles and this took the longest to get.
1,CD version,"I ordered the CD version - which turns out to only be playable in a computer. Even though it is probably interesting information, the voice is an unbearable computer sounding monotone that makes it impossible to listen to (if you have any sensitivity to sound) And you have to be willing to only sit at the computer to hear it. Watch out - don't get this version."
5,Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the thought World,Very well writen and if you use the law of attraction properly you can definitly change your life!
3,small but big,"This book is ok. Even though it is small, it shares some big concepts. I found that I had to reread sometimes to get the true meaning. i rated it low because anyone new to Law Of Attraction would have a time reading it."
2,Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World,"Interesting material for 1900's. Although the author keeps saying he will teach the reader ""how"", the instructions are not exactly spelled out. He repeats the same things over and over but in subtly different ways. You have to interpert the meaning yourself.I am pleased to see old works such as these in print again."
2,MP3 version unexpected,I thought I was ordering a CD but it came in MP3 form. I'm 72 years old and not computer literate so can't handle it. But I didn't keep the return form so I'm up the creek!
4,Great basic study of Law of Attraction,"This is one of the more interesting examples of an older book that has some perfect pieces of wisdom but the only problem is there really wasn't the volume of ""great ideas"" that you could get in other books. This is certainly not one of the classic self help books but the ideas about the Law of Attraction are present. The book is short and that doesn't help it's case as a good value in books. There are several books out there that are shorter with much more useful ideas. I'm not saying there aren't great ideas but comparatively speaking it's a fast read and useful just simply not the most useful. In summary, it's small investment but I don't think it's a life changing book."
4,First Missionary to the Moslems,"The reason I purchased this book was to wright a Bio for my missions calss on any Missionary of my choice. After reading acerps from another book, I knew I wanted to pruchase this book. This was very easy reading. A 9-year old could read read it with good understanding. It's fast reading, and left a lot to the imagination. If you are doing research or just reading for fun...this is the book!"
5,FURREAL FRIENDS NEWBORN PUPPY IS AWESOME!,"I bought a couple FurReal Newborn puppies for my daughters (3 and 9), and they just love them. They are so cute a cuddly. They make cute sounds, and movements. My daughters take them where ever they go. They even sleep with them. I have nothing but good to say about these puppies."
1,a overrated Bum,"Bill Romanoski is a smug Arrogant cat who is still trying to justify His Reputation around the NFL. He was a bigot who made alot of Racist remarks,took alot of steriods,beat up a teammate,spit in a Wide Reciever's face&did alot of really lame things&still never got any real suspension.funny how folks jump all over other Players,but Bill Romanoski is a very tacky turkey.somehow despite all that He admits too, because He has a Charisma about him some network will give him another shot,no pun intended."
3,A man with incredible drive,"A good book, but not a great one. Romanowski has written from his heart and that's what appealed to me. The journey of his life so far is all about him - no bashing or tattling on others. He has an incredible amount of drive that's inspiring and he's constantly trying to improve himself. Interestingly, his motivation came from insecurity, and it seemed to me that he wrote the book partly for his own emotional therapy. There's a lot of good nutritional information for active people of all ages, but as a whole, the book might be of more interest to a high school or college level reader and/or athlete."
3,roid nation,This is a book mainly aimed at the aspiring athlete/weekend warrior or someone who is interested in the science of training (including dabbling with steroids) and to push his/her physical limits
1,Subscribe to a tabloid instead,"This book is poorly written, full of his big ego, and generally just trashy. If you want to read a book about how great someone thinks he is, at least make it a book by someone that has done something useful for our world. Romo spends too much time trying to justify things that are inexcusable. After reading this book, one is left guessing that a) he needed a new ego boost now that he's retired and b) he's greedy and wants even more money than he already has."
3,Good If You're a Fan,"If you're a dedicated football fan, fitness enthusiast, or simply a fan of Romo's, you'll definitely enjoy this book. It's actually quite inspiring to read how incredibly passionate Romonowski was to improving himself for the one single goal he had in mind: to make the NFL. I admire him for his dedication to improvement, even though he felt he lacked the genetic skills to be a ""natural"" NFL player. It was also interesting to learn a bit of 'behind-the-scenes' information about life in the NFL. It's a good read, but not a great one. Again, you'll love it if you're a football fan or if you're a fan of Romo's."
3,Not much about Football,"Interesting book about Romo's use of suppliments and his nutritional obsession, but not much about his life on the field.I would much rather read about his life playing the game, instead of reading about what vitamins and nutrients he was taking.The nutrition aspect of this book is a bit boring."
5,A fantastic look into the mind of a monster!,"An unbelievable look into the life of a man who would never take a ribbon for second place.This book actually shows the mindset of a maniac who would do anything and everything possible to get to the top and stay there.""Romo"" is a great book that reveals the life on and off the field of possibly the greatest linebacker to ever play pro football. I highly recommend this book to any sports/football fan that would like to glance into the psyche of a football player.This book had me day dreaming of the days I played football, and wanting to get back out on the field to hit someone as hard as possible. Thoroughly enjoyable and a permanent addition to my sports library."
1,WHAT A LEMON,"Sony really messed up with the 500 series for their DVD players. They all seem to break after 8 months or so. My player stoped reading ANY discs (even brand new, out-of-the-box discs). It would either read ""NO DISC"" or C13:00 ERROR. Both problems make renting or watching a DVD a serious headache. WARNING: do not buy this model. It will only make your ""movie-time"" bothersome."
1,This DVD player has a 100% Failure Rate.,"I bought this DVD, my sister bought this DVD, and my brother and sister in law both bought as well at the same time. After about a year and a half of use they are All NONFUNCTIONAL, displaying C 13 errors and NO DISC for all the DVD's that I try to play, some didn't even last that long. Sony should be ashamed to have produced such a poor product. I would recommend not buying any SONY product based on this experience."
3,Finally dying too,"I guess I've been really lucky. After 4-5 years (?), my player's just starting to give c:13 errors - on about 20 percent of my Netflix rentals. One hint for people having problems: my player's become very sensitive to heat and shuts down frequently unless I give it very good ventilation. So try fanning your DVD player if you can't get through an entire movie. (Talk about being a slave to technology!)"
2,"Another C13/""No Disc"" Victim","""Me too"" review ahead. I was amazed (and relieved, in a way) at how many others here have seen the same thing I am now experiencing with this DVD player. As another person wrote, the player worked well when it worked. I've owned my DVP-S550D for over 6 years, and ""fortunately"", the frequent C13:00 errors didn't crop up until a year ago or so. Since then, the problem worsened: the player stopped playing DVDs it used to, no matter how clean they were. And currently, it just responds with ""NO DISC"" for any DVD/CD I put in. I have not contacted Sony yet; was considering trying to get it fixed, but after reading other posts here, seems better to trash it and just get a new one."
2,Plagued by power sync problem,"I was very pleased with the player for the two weeks it actually worked. Then the power supply problem set in. A slow decline. And instead of banging on the thing to get it going, I've decided to send it back. Wouldn't have expected an expensive Sony unit to have this problem."
1,! WARNING - DO NOT BUY A SONY DVD PLAYER !,"I purchased my DVP-735 back in 2000. It was a wonderful ""flagship"" product, and I even rated it highly on a website such as this. However, since then it has been locking up in every movie that we watch (generally near the end). The irony is that a local agent - Next Electronics charged me > NZ$300 to have the pickup assembly replaced (with a 3 month warranty). Guess what - the damned piece of crap failed after 4 months - even worse than before. SONY, if you are listening, I am not too happy with your product or customer support. The local ""Sony Centre"" in Wellington seems to brush off faulty product that is beyond its warranty date. Every time my flatmates and I watch a DVD, it locks up - MOST EMBARRASINGLY! DO NOT BUY A SONY DVD PLAYER. If I could go back in time, I would have burnt the NZ$1,100 I spent purchasing this DVD player, rather than suffer its problems."
4,Forgetting Some Basics....,"Just received this player for Christmas. Marvellous! Page 7 of the manual, though, says you can't connect the player to a TV which does not have a video input connector. I have an old Sony 13"" Trinitron with an antenna connection only. Nothing in the manual gives any guidance as to how to hook this up. There's nothing about accessories. Amazon's DVD buying guide doesn't mention this issue in the section on video hook-ups. Someone asks about it on the Amazon discussion board, and there's an incomplete answer about needing an adapter. What one? How much does it cost? So after looking all over on Amazon for 2+ hours, I guess I'll just call the electronics store....And Sony's remote doesn't include a TV mute button. No button for muting! Other than omitting these basics, I'm sure the machine will be first-rate, whenever I figure out how to connect it...."
2,Useless with CD-ROMs,"Great DVD features, especially bookmarks (nine for each of up to 200 movies). Sony keeps an A+ for picture quality, and the jog shuttle is easy and fun. CD sound is great... IF it'll play it at all. This unit (my copy anyway) completely refuses to play homemade CDs (audio CDs created in my home PC). EVERY other CD player I own plays these discs fine, including my old Sony discman and older Sony DVD player, Pioneer LD player, many other units. Do NOT assume this player can suffice as your only home CD player if you like to burn your own CDs. I wanted to buy a digital camcorder and my my own video CDs but I doubt the Sony will play these right either. :("
1,Same story...different DVD player,My story is just as others have mentioned. I have always had good luck with Sony products but this one is junk. I was a little bit luckier as mine has lasted almost 2 years. The player just stopped working with the C13:00 error and now won't read a single disc. I am not going to even bother contacting Sony as others say it won't do any good. Do not buy this product!
3,A great player if you don't care about lip-sync,"I've had nothing but trouble with Sony DVD players. This one's audio gets out of sync with the picture after the layer switch on dual-layer DVDs. My previous one, Sony's PBD-V30, couldn't play the second layer of any DVD without skipping. I took that one back and the dealer couldn't get replacement parts from Sony. I love Sony's design and features, but I wonder about their quality anymore."
1,Another Recipient of the C-13 and No Disc error,"I could not be more dissatisfied with this DVD player. I deliberately bought this higher-end (at the time) player to avoid problems like these. Thank goodness I bought a 5-year warranty on it. So far I have taken the player in 4 times, two times ago, they replaced the entire optical laser unit and it still resulted in the same problems. It skips and freezes during every movie now. I have friends who have also had problems with Sony DVD Players. Buyer beware!!!"
5,AWESOME DVD PLAYER,"I purchased this unit about two weeks ago in FLA. Needless tosay the lip sync problem never appeared and the serial number andfirmware confirm that I am safe! The image on this puppy is abolutely amazing. You should use component connections to really appreciate the video quality. I already have a dolby decoder on my amp but the audio has greatly improved with this player. The features are awesome (gotta love being able to load an image as your default screnn). Overall, top-notch player for a decent price. I highly recommend it!"
1,C13 Errors Got You Down?,"Bought this because of the Sony name and reputation. Since then, we have received the charming C 13:00 error many times. The DVD player we bought for $39 never fails to recognize a commercial DVD. Guess which product name brand we will never buy again?!?S O N YBecause they've done nothing to correct this--and they never will."
1,class action law suite,"I am now getting the infamous c13:00 error that everyone is talking about. I WAS a hard core Sony fan, but I know now that I am not going to purchase another Sony product. The classaction if it goes through will give you a cheap rebuilt $60 sony player without any of the functions I now have or did have or a 40 credit. If you go on the Sony repair site they admit that they will not repair your unit, but will ""SELL"" you a rebuilt unit for $300. BEWARE of this product."
2,A good player but Sync Problems,"I purchased my S550D without reviewing other brands and products, believing that I could not go wrong with Sony. I had to have my player repaired due to a sync problem between the sound and video. It gets worse as you watch until you cannot stand it anymore. Sony fixed it, but I am afraid it will come back."
2,it's plastic...why so $$$$?,"This requires both hands to operate. It trickles just fine, I'm just not sure I know why it was as expensive as it was considering my kids get better stuff for 25cents out of the toy machines at pizza hut."
2,CHEAPLY MADE - save a plastic spoon from a take out lunch and make do,This is a great idea - about as cheaply made as possible. Under normal use it comes apart easily. Sort of works if you are ridiculously careful to keep it together.
4,Works fine but I think I can make it better...,Works easy enough but I would like to see a snap on lid and the pipe have a slight incline so the powder doesn't leak out so easily.
4,Rodeo or football?,"I was looking for something to entertain me, and The Scarecrow Murders did just that.The storyline is believable, the characters are likable, and the setting is great. Can you imagine someone wanting to hold a rodeo on a college football field when there's a big game coming up? But there's a lot more to the people involved than meets the eye. Mary Welk has done a great job bringing these two worlds together. And Caroline, the no-nonsense protagonist, will keep you on your toes.I'm looking forward to reading more from Mary Welk."
5,"Amazing Soundtrack, Heavy Bands & Heavy Sounds","Tons of great rock bands. Some old and some new. All the tracks are great. Worth buying for Megadeth alone let alone Anthrax, Ministry, Fear Factory, Static X and Gwar. Great record! I can't wait to see the movie."
5,Best Singer/Actress Since Sills,Saw this live in HD and was blown away by this Diva's performance. Had to buy the DVD to enjoy it again again.
5,Best I've Viewed,"Over the years I've seen many performances of this opera both live and on tape. This currently is at the top of the list. Ellina Garanca IS CARMEN from head to toe and embodies her in everything she does, her looks (beautiful, erotic), singing (lovely), dancing (appropriately exciting and provocative(and acting. Only way this performance could have been better for mne if YOUNG Placido Domingo had been Don Jose. However, Alagna came close and both acted and sang very well. The whole cast is to be commended but especially the young conductor Nezet-Seguin whose conducting was sensitive to cast and music throughout. He's one of the relatively, new young, extremely talented conductors on the scene today. Glibert (NYPHIL) and Dudamel (LAPhil)are the others. Opera and Classical Music fans have much to look forward to."
5,Impecable performance,"Bizet: CarmenCarmen.I wanted to buy this DVD when it came out, because when I saw this production on PBSAnd hearing on the radio when it was performed directly from the Met, I found all the characters very convincing.The behavior of all characters were real, their relationships was very natural, the transformation of the feelings, for instance when Carmen seduces Jose at the beginning of the opera, his love for her that brings him to the point that he is capable of leaving everything behind to obtain her love and at the end ,because she doesn't love him anymore he kills her.The rest of the characters play also an important role in the argument of the story.I have to say that the singing, the chemistry that is shown among the principal characters is outstanding.I found this DVD a perfect example of an impeccable performance of this opera."
5,Carmen,"I have loved this opera my whole life and have always understood it but, this one was not only performed well, the subtitles were wonderful. I loved it!"
5,Great opera,"Carmen is one of the most famous operas ever. By Georges Bizet, it was first performed in 1875. It is one of my favorite operas of all time. Carmen has very popular music, including The Hanbanera and The Toreador Song. This is an excellent performance from the Met. Elina Garanca stands out as Carmen, giving a great performance. The video and audio quality are also very high. This Carmen is a must see for new opera fans."
4,Wrong listing,"These reviews have been assigned to the wrong product. The photo and product information refer to the Arena di Verona production starring Marina Domashenko, but the reviews refer to John Eliot Gardiner's production using period instruments! My rating applies to the Verona production."
1,Please - somebody find me the French version!,Don't waste your time with this dubbed-in-English video. There's no comparison with the original French version with English subtitles...
2,Dubbed in English?? Are you kidding?,"It is one of the most astonishing, attractive, and unforgettable movies. However, I would not buy this tape unless it is dubbed in French(!?)."
2,DVD and VHS miss out. What a pity!!!,"I finally got to see the DVD, and it really misses out. The original blue tinted night scenes are now black and white, the lush bedroom reds and oranges are gone. Most of it remains true, but these serious deficincies really ruin the experience, especially for those of us who saw it in the theatre and remember it very well.The VHS, which I saw but never bought, suffers from a lethargic dubbines treatment and apparently some rough chop. I wonder if somehow the original version shown in american theatres was somehow recolorized back then. No one I know remembers it as clearly as I do, but neither version is very satisfying. Amazing how many missteps occurred in this releasing this wonderful romantic flick."
1,a bad reprint of a great film,"I just saw the broadcast of this version on the ""Speed"" cable tv channel. The audio sounded like it came over a telephone, The English dubbing ruins the romance, and the video almost looked like it was done by aiming a video camera at a movie screen. In fact, the movie screen had some spots on it that didn't move. Of course this could have been the cable channel's fault.I decided to buy my own dvd of the movie on Amazon, and was discouraged to find only the dubbed version. If the French language version with subtitles was good enough for the original American theater release, Why change it? I'm waiting for a re-release with decent production values and the original French language script."
3,A Man and A Woman,"The original movie, which was the winner of the '66 Cannes Film Festival,was MAGNIFICENT in its original language. The English ruins the effect of the entire enxperience. Seeing it in French (with English subtitles)was magic along with the French lyrics to the accompanying music. The terrible ""tonality"" of the voices on the dubbed version cheapens the experience and makes it a totally different, flatter movie, and not nearly as romantic and sensual.Please advise viewers if a new version containing French language (English Subs), and French music comes along. That would be wonderful!!!! Because I, for one, have NEVER forgotten the romance of this movie."
3,Like colorizing Citizen Kane,"Let's be clear about this. I've loved this movie since I first saw it in the late sixties, and when I saw it recently on DVD I was pleasantly surprised to find that it had lost none of its charm; it's every bit as fresh and original as when I first saw it.So why only three stars?Because the transfer to DVD has lost one of the movie's trademarks - the tinted black and white sections.I remember the blue night scenes, and the orangy-red bedroom shots. All gone! Well, not quite gone - it looks like the transfer process did its bit to adjust the color balance but didn't quite make it, so the night scenes are very slightly bluish, and there is a hint of yellow about the interior shots.It's all the more annoying since one of the unaltered interior shots is used as the background for the main menu.Come on Warner. How about sorting this out when you ship out the inevitable 'director's cut'And when you do, I'll give it five stars (or six, if I can get away with it)"
1,Snore!,"I rented this video based on the wonderful things I had heard about it, and I enjoy exploring the classics. I honestly have no idea why this is a classic, or why it is so beloved. What it is is a great cure for insomnia."
4,A Man and A Woman,A Man and A Woman showing love between two people and in a family atmosphere was nicely done. Our group felt the love portrayed and it was so nice to see vs the violence and car chases and damages shown in today's many movies. The background music was fabulous. Plan on buying a cd if available.
5,"Great music, great story, great DVD !",This is a wonderful classic French film for all times about love. The story and the music are superb ! No more words. Don't miss it. Let's include it in our particular stock of materpieces at home.
3,A great score and some great scenes,"I wouldn't buy this version either, I'd want the original French. But one of the very best sequences in it doesn't have any dialogue, just music - the trip in the fishing boat. This is overwhelmingly beautiful, a high point in Francis Lai's wonderful score.At times you might think that the title is 'A man, a woman and a car'. I could have done with fewer shots of the ubiquitous Mustang. Many scenes are absurdly glamorized. But the stars are wonderful, and the scene when they first make love and she is overcome with sadness is poignant and unforgettable."
3,They don't make them like they used to!,"Sure it's heavier duty than run of the mill cheap box fans, but considering the bulkiness of it and the weight which normally accomdates a decent motor **AND THE PRICE** you'd think it would be quieter. See, the smaller the motor the more noise it makes because it's made to work hard, kinda' like a those ear-deafening little motorclyles or bikes that cruise up and down the residential streets using the grass-mower engines; they're trying to do a big work with a little engine, same as this is. The price is too high for what one gets is the bottom line. With shipping it should not cost more than thirty bucks."
2,False Advertising,The fan does not have 2 120 volt outlets for connecting other tools or appliances as advertised.
5,Best ever,This is by far the best box fan I have ever owned.On low speed it is more powerful than most other box fans on high speed
5,great fan,"I've used this fan all summer and it is still going strong. I have a split level house, and the upper level is always warmer in the summertime. I use the fan at the top of the stairs to help circulate the air evenly throughout the house. I have run the fan on low speed all night and the fan noise did not disrupt my sleep."
3,"Good concept, but flawed","The innovation of this case is that, since the belt clip is a holster instead of just a clip, there isn't a huge knob on the back of the case itself. The case fits nicely for the most part, looks good, and preserves the sleek look of the Razr. The big drawback is that the silicone skin is very frictional, and getting it into and out of your pocket (if that's how you carry your phone) is a big hassle in itself. Forget getting it out of your pocket while driving. Smaller annoyances are that you have to take the top half off and hold it down to take a picture, and the part that fits over the earpiece tends to slip off if you talk for any length of time."
3,Hidden Gem,This movie is pretty good.The music is good and i don't really have any real complaints.....
4,A great novel and an amazing ride,"Patriots in Arms is the third book in a series by Mr. Weaver. The story follows Scott St. Andrew through his military career. Mr. Weaver tells an interesting story about a colonial rebellion. With a couple of background stories one of the major side stories is about the intergration of a discrimated class through their roles in the military and the effect of an extraordinary event(an alien device)Each of the novels builds on the previous story leading ultimately to an expected but highly satisfying ending.The only disappointment is Mr. Weaver's use of an artifial device to bring about the acceptance of his main charector. Though, this device is lessened because the it appears that it is more the leadership, character and humanity of St. Andrew that helps him bring about the intergration, and less the extraordinary device.But still I found Mr. Weaver's writing to be exciting and attention keeping, and I look forward to his next adventure."
2,There is no weight to it.,When I recieved the watch I noticed how light it was. It is a little on the big side. It states that the watch is stainless but the middle section of the band is shiney chrome not stainles. A good looking watch but too shiney for me.
5,Enchanting!,This is my all time favorite Hank the Cowdog book! I love Madam Moonshine and Wallace and Junior. It's witty and humorous throughout the book. I'm impatiently waiting for #34 to come out. I recomend any of these books to children and adult alike.
4,Hank rocks!,"John M. Erickson, <strong>Hank the Cowdog, vol. 2: The Further Adventures of Hank the Cowdog</strong> (Puffin Books, 1983)Hank's second adventure (of... I no longer know, but it's a number larger than ""many"") starts out with Hank, after a tussle with something he shouldn't have tussled with, developing a nasty case of crossed-eyetis and needing to go find himself a solution before he gets offed by anything from his girl's new boyfriend, a nasty pinscher, to the local barn cat. Very simple language, straightforward plot, lots of action, and an engaging narrative voice should make this one a winner with reluctant readers and bibliovores alike. ***"
5,Very Very Funny and Enjoyable Books,We are reading the second book....the only problem I have with these books are that they are so funny! I have a hard time reading them because we are all giggling so hard. Really...they are that funny. It is a great bonding experience with the kids. It's nice to share a good belly laugh with the kids. I highly recommend them.
3,"Is this the ""Original"" Soundtrack?","This would be a cause for rejoicing if this were the ""Original"" soundtrack recording from Otto Preminger's 1955 film version of Hammerstein's and Bizet's ""Carmen Jones."" But due to the lack of depth in the CD there are no lush stereophonic sounds of the instruments and voices and this is probably a recording of a recording without any inordinate preparation for enhancement of any kind. Everything has a boxed in quality as if the beauty of the production were being saved for another recording and this one would present a good approximation of what it could sound like leaving one feel cheated. I guess this is the era for this kind of presentation when digital is everyone's claim to better sound. But then for a $1.56 it might seem like a good buy. As for these unauthorized re-issues, this is miles ahead of the recent CD ""import"" of the 1959 film version of ""Porgy and Bess"" that makes no mention of even the word ""stereo."""
3,I'd take Terry Farrell any time!,"I must admit that I watched much of this video with the sound down but could never take my eyes off the screen when Terry Farrell was on camera. Though miscast as the sinister wealthy brunette, she steals the film in elegant clothes (this is not the hashhouse chick from Becker!) and her pure beauty outclasses her supposed rival, protrayed blandly by Jennie Garth. The man in the middle is particularly ineffectual and Terry is probably better off without him."
1,One word - awful,"I am a fan of Danielle Steele's movies and own most of them. This was the worst one I've seen. I found the acting to be very poor, as exemplified by the main character, portrayed by Jennie Garth. I feel she was badly miscast with her Betty Boop protrayal. The best performance was given by the beautiful, status-seeking wife. Personally, I wouldn't waste money on this, but would save it for Jewels, The Ring, to name a couple of wonderful interpretations of Danielle Steele's books."
4,Sensitive and sweet story,Great movie. Very sweet story line.Makes you think twice about what is important to you and what makes you happy. Jennie Garth was terrific as were all of the actors in this movie. Very entertaining....
2,Movie is just okay,"I liked this movie because I like Craig Bierko, he's such a hunk. The acting is mediocre though with the exception of the actress that played Bierko's wife. Jenny Garth is not a good actress, but if you like sappy chick flicks, you will like this movie. I have yet to see a Danielle Steel film that is as good as Lace, which is the best film of all and extremely hard to get. This movie was predictable."
3,good and bad,"like the many sizes and the pans themselves, but wish they had the glass lids so you could leave the lids on instead of having to take them off to check on food."
5,"Kitchenaid Gourmet Essentials Hard Base 12 Piece Cookware Set, Navy",the set was delivered on time.the pots are both stlyish and functionalthey have a nice weight on them and are sturdy and the handles are comfortablebeen cooking on them since december and have had no complaintswashing up is now a breeze
5,Slick looking cookware,"I purchased this cookware set becuase I love the color and the brand. The pans are very sturdy, you can really feel them in your hand. I have been cooking with them for about a month now and I just love it. The Handles are silicone and can go into the oven at lower temperatures. I noticed that if I grab the handle close to the end of the handle it can be a little hot as the silicone tapers a little bit. The non stick coating works great and seems like it should last a really long time. I got a great price on the set and would purchase again."
5,Navy Blue.. but goes well with cobalt sets!,"Although the price on these pots and pans were slightly better when I bought them I would still say they are worth the money. Though watch they do go up and down in price. When buying these pots and pans all I was thinking was buy ""quality"". I skimped the last two years and I bought pretty cheap pots and pans, and the non-stick started to flake off after two months. The Kitchen Aid pans have been in use for three months now and still look and feel like they are brand new. I have to also admit they a heavier, better feeling, cooler to the touch, and very even heated without those ""special rings"" on the bottom of the pans. You can go to Target locally and get them but you only get 10 pieces.. get them here and you get 12 and pay the same price."
2,Does not match picture...,"I was trying to replace two seats with same looking slow closers. The product photograph does not match what was sent. Product that was sent had a very different look. Fortunately, with Amazon, returns are no problem. Amazon could save a lot of shipping costs if their products matched the pictures. These were returned and I purchased others from Amazon. Again, the replacements did not match the picture. This time the look was acceptable and they were installed."
2,Weak summary of the E-Myth Revisited.,"This book is a watered down version of the E-myth Revisited, which is a good book. The E-Myth Contactor - is a summary of M. Gerber's program with ""contractor stories."" There is no true insight into the contactor industry. My guess is this is the 1st of many books focusing on specific industries. My advice is to skip this book, just purchase Gerber's E-Myth Revisited & make the connections yourself."
2,It puts a hook in your mouth.,"This book is filled with wonderful ideas and philosophies. They all make sense and seem to put you on the path to the realization of your goals. The problem is that not all the keys to making the ideas work that you could actually put into practice are provided in the book. The idea of the book seems to be to get the reader excited and then point them to a web site where one can sign up for classes (at a healthy fee) to learn the fundementals of the systems and how to put them to use. The limited scope of the book was no doubt designed to provide the author, Mr. Gerber, with more income than he receives just through book sales. I would be very cautious before getting hooked because the ""rest of the story"" is provided in a lengthy process that is quite expensive."
2,Not worth the time or money,"This book repeats a few of the strategies presented in ""The E-Myth Revisted"", trying to point them at the contractor. Unfortunately, except for a couple of good ideas from that book, there is nothing here but fluff and pep talk. At one point, I think you can actually tell where material was cut-and-pasted from the sister book about medical practices, where they accidentally forgot to change ""practice"" to ""contracting business"".If you found some chapters of the ""The E-Myth Revisted"" to be a bit fluffy for you, you can count on an entire (although short) book of it here. Very dissapointing and not particularly useful."
5,A welcome extenstion to his other books,"Gerber's books on the EMyth should be required reading in MBA schools and should be provided free by all CPA's of the world.He describes how you need to work ON your business (developing franchiseable systems) rather than IN your business (as a worker).This book extends that theme for contractors. There is alot of new material here that updates previous versions. I was able to read it quickly in an afternoon... even after extensive underlinings. I went to his web site and researched other books here on Amazon.Overall, this should be recommended reading for any entrepreneur, particularly those that have been in business for several years and are frustrated."
5,Another Tool for Your Toolbelt,"I have recently finished reading The E-Myth Contractor ""Why Most Contractors' Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It"" (for the second time) and once again Michael Gerber (author of E-Myth Revisited) ""hits the nail on the head."" Not only does the E-Myth Contractor motivate and inspire, it provides simple ""tools"" that will help you put your business and life into perspective -- Michael Gerber suggests, ""that they are one in the same!"" The E-Myth Contractor is well written, to-the-point and an easy read. In this book, you will find out what makes most companies successful and how you can apply those principles and systems to your business."
1,Too Many Chiefs,"I was initially impressed when I first started reading Gerber.He quickly captures your attention with well described scenariosof everyday business problems.Small contractor can identify with time, employee,and cash flow issues.The second one half of the book moves rapidly to conceptualrather than the practical solutions to the initial problems.We all know we need a ""business plan"", and we all knowat times that we need to read ""inspirational material"" to boostour spirit.I found this book somewhat lacking in a more conciseand specific formula that was promised to createthe changes needed to alleviate the common woes.In the very end you are left with the same problem:someone has to be in charge. An office or a businessleft with all the chiefs running amuck isa dangerous situation. I give thisbook one thumb down.C. Billick"
2,The Sequel is never as good!,"I loved the book ""The E Myth Revisited"" so I thought the ""E-Myth for Contractors"" would be a good version for a contractor friend of mine - I was wrong.Spend your money and time on the original E-Myth and consider this book just a cheap knock off meant to capitalize on the success of the authors first book."
3,"Quick Read, Simplistic Lessons that are often overlooked","I finished this book in less than a week and learned some lessons that I have often overlooked. That's the premise of the book, why make everything so complicated, just work on the simple issues and that will usually resolve most of the complicated issues. Since it was a quick read I was happy to complete the book even though it is directed at the Construction industry instead of the general contracting term that I was expecting. With that said, it was still well written and didn't waste a lot of time getting to the point."
2,Fluff,"Wouldn't you like to read to read a book where every other paragraph begins with a rhetorical question? And wouldn't you like to read a book that has all the rhetorical answers you never knew you didn't need? Sarcasm aside, if you are aware enough to be looking for this type of help for your business, then you already know more than this book has to offer. It is a fast read because there is little real information, mostly rhetorical questions, and a few anecdotes."
4,Great Intro Book to the E-Myth for Trades,"A short but pretty powerful book. The trades are probably the furthest behind of the service oriented industries in eveloping a repetitive and replicatable system for delivery. The view of the trades as a guild or craft goes back nearly a thousand years - if not further - and the skills required have been carefully taught through a guild and union system.Now, the trades are seeing the same transformation as other skilled workers such as the chef, the accountant, the mechanic and the lawyer. Technology, information and customer expectations have made consistent delivery and service critical to success, and the challenge of finding qualified trade labor makes systems and training important to meet those increased customer needs.Gerber points all this out in an easy to read, but hard hitting little book. If you work in or consult to the trades, this book is important foundational reading!"
3,the E-Myth Contractor,"Good book with good ""back to the basic"" information which we all need to be reminded of from time to time."
4,Air King,This fan is replacing a 22 year old similar fan. The air king is a bit more noisy than the previous. The air king puts out plenty of air and seems adequate. We run the fan at night in the bedroom.
1,flimsy construction,"We never got to use this fan; it arrived broken at the neck. It's made of a cheap plastic which could not withstand the perils of the shipping. Also, the packing was poorly done. The unit was returned. Fortunately, Amazon.com credit our charge card."
3,BAD MISTAKE,although this may be a collector's dvd for the early era/generation of cliff and the shadows - be aware: THIS DVD IS NOT IN DTS AS CLEARLY ADVETISED. it is not understood how this dvd could have been PROMOTED as DTS - seeing there is nowhere misleading information on the dvd-box. the sound is good BUT ONLY AFTER TURNING THE VOLUME PAST 12 0'CLOCK on the amplifier's volume dial.bad outlet negligence.andre
2,Not as expected,"I was promised 3-d glasses and there were none. I repeatedly tried to contact the seller to remedy the problem, but I heard nothing back."
3,"An introduction, but very little computing","While the book does an adequate job of explaining the purpose to bioinformatics, it wasn't very technical. I had it as a text for a graduate course, and many of us whose background was in computing found a need to find outside references. It's not a bad book for some high level coverage, but it never seems to get to the meat of a subject in much depth or detail. It is more for someone interested in existing tools and databases, but not for a developer who wants to get started in this field. If you're in that category you may want to look at some other text books such as ""Bioinformatics in the Post Genomic Era"" by Augen or ""Fundamental Concepts of Bioinformatics"" by Krane and Raymer. Another potential source is Lesk's ""Introduction to Bioinformatics"" (a bit older, but it does talk about specific computational skills)."
5,Great product; fast delivery,So glad I ordered this. The collar is wonderful. Shipping was very quick. Especially exicted that it will last 5 months. You can't beat that.
1,Junk!,"We live in Texas and have been battling ticks all summer. After trying all sorts of drops, I resorted to a collar. I took a chance on these and they did absolutely NOTHING!! Don't waste your money!"
1,Not working at all,The collar does not work at all. My dog still have the same flea problem after applying this collar. I really doubt where the 5 month control comes from.
2,Not as helpful as I had hoped,"I purchased this book along with several other transistor books. This book is very short and really only has the most basic information on transistors and FETs. When I say basic, I mean basic. It goes over some simple schematic representations of common transistors and FETs, that's about it though. There are a few transfer functions of transistors, but no common use circuits, or their explanations. There are far better books on transistors."
1,DO NOT BUY,"POOR QUALITY AND SOUND, TODDLERS CAN NOT LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS JUNK! THE LETTERS ARE SHOWN BUT NO SOUNDS LIKE IF THE CHILDREN ARE ALREADY SUPPOSE TO KNOW THIS ON THEIR OWN!!!"
2,Forget this one,"I read Judas Virus by David Best and it was a better book than this one. Marti Segerson suffers the loss of her sister to a deranged killer and eighteen years later, Marti is now a psychiatrist who gets hired to work at the same mental assylum where Vernon Odessa, the killer, is institutionalized. Her motive for going to medical school and becoming a shrink is to exact revenge on Odessa. What a stupid plot to begin with and the execution is just as bad. Once hired by Gibson State, Marti immediately launches into her plan and is so obvious about what she is up to, it ruins any mystery or suspense the author may have hoped to have present.The characters in this book are transparent and cartoonish. There may have been a way to make the plot and storyline work, but Mr. Best missed the boat. While not a total waste of time, there is much to be desired in this corny story."
4,Nice story,This is they type of cartonish movies my daughter likes to watch. It has a beautiful story to it. My daughter loves it.
5,its a movie alright,I like some of Tim Burton's films and would put this one on the list of his movies I've enjoyed.
5,kids liked it,both 9 and 12 year old enjoyed it and it made a long car ride much much shorter. I recommend.
5,Excellent in every way~,"Just simply fantastic~ I LOVE all the music in this movie.I have watched this movie at least 20 times over the years it's been around, it just gets better and better as I catch new little nuances in it. Burton is truly a great artist, and this is a great piece of art!"
5,Great Movie,"Big fan of stop-motion, especially with Tim Burton's story telling. Haven't actually watched blu-ray version yet(PS3 died), but the movie is amazing. Favorite idea is the twist on the view of the living compared to the dead. Plus the score is amazing from Danny Elfman."
1,I dont care what any of you say this movie SUCKS!,"Let me start by saying that I love Tim Burton and all of his work except for this.. his only other claymation film was of course the wonderful nightmare before christmas i thought this move was stupid had no point, the music was bad and i found myself looking at the door in the theatre wondering when this boring movie was going to end ...... very sad"
3,Not as Bad as I Thought,"Initially thinking it was just another animated movie that goth kids would masturbate too, I was dragged to it by my girlfriend (well, her friend actually) and was pleasently surprised. What might be 2005's best date movie now arrives on DVD. The story is cute, mildy amusing and non-abrasive. Despite my disdain towards Tim Burton (including the fact that he references nearly all of his films in 'Corpse Bride'), I have found myself to enjoy this movie. Personally, not a mandatory purchase, but worth a rent if you are looking for a decent movie in an attempt to woo the girl (or whatever) that finally took up your offer to see a movie."
2,Tim Burton doesn't seem like he is trying anymore.,"I honestly can't see how this move merits 4 of 5 stars. I have enjoyed almost every Burton movie out there, but this one seems severely lacking. The plot is droll, almost like Burton read the cliff notes version of the fable. The character development (what little of it there was) is painfully easy to predict, more like a fledgling directors work. The score was weak at best. Elfman just didn't seem to put as much into this project as he has in others. It seems to me that Burton and Elfman put in a whole weekend worth of thought into this work. The only reason I gave this film 2 stars was for some beautifully dark visuals."
2,Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a little lacking.,"Before I go into details about what I didn't like in this movie, the characters looked beautiful.Other than that, most aspects of the movie seemed rushed and sloppy. The stop-motion animation was not nearly as smooth as in The Nightmare Before Christmas(TNBC). The soundtrack was mediocre at best, though there was occassionally interesting background music.The movie is just over an hour long and it really seems to have a slow storyline. If I could go back in time, I would not go to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. As a Burton fan, the movie was simply sub-par. Tim Burton can and has done better work."
5,I wish I could vote 6...,"Saw this movie opening day and I have to say that I was pleased, once again, by the mastermind Tim Burton.I see alot of reviews saying that it wasn't as good a ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", but he didn't make it as a sequel or a prequel. So really, it's unfair to this movie to compare it to a totally unrelated movie, or any movie for that matter.I've also heard alot of things saying, ""I knew Depp was a necrophiliac!"" To quote Johnny Depp himself in his autobiography, ""If people are debating my sexuality then they have far too much time on their hands"". The fact of the matter is that Tim Burton started Depp off in his acting career from late teen years all the way into adulthood. He said that if Burton wanted him to stare at a camera for five hours he'd do it for him. So naturally, Depp did this movie.And I end this lesson/review with once again, I vote five stars.Tim Burton, I'll love you 'till the end."
5,A Nicole Review,"Set in a 19th century European village, this stop-motion, animated feature follows the story of Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young man who is whisked away to the underworld and wed to a mysterious ""Corpse Bride,"" while his real bride, Victoria, waits bereft in the land of the living.Though life in the Land of the Dead proves to be a lot more colorful than his strict Victorian upbringing, Victor learns that there is nothing in this world, or the next, that can keep him away from his one true love."
5,Another great by Tim Burton.,"I have always been a fan of Tim Burton and his works, and I would highly recommend his latest Corpse Bride. The plot is simple for children, but engrossing for adults."
4,"Odd, but still charmingly cute!","I do not know much of Burton's work and I decided to watch this movie based on the fact that I like good movies.Victor (Depp) is to marry the beautiful Victoria (Watson), but during the rehearsal he gets the vows mixed up so he goes to the woods to practice. He proceeds to unknowingly ask the corpse Emily (Carter) to be his bride and she accepts; bringing him with her back 6 feet under.It a charming, odd (but cute at the same time) and fun movie. It's not hysterically fun, but the way Burton uses irony to get the message across is thrilling. Burton also makes you guessing which one Victor will end up marrying in the end. This movie is good entertainment without being Oscar material. It makes me want to get into Burtons work and see what else he has done."
2,The animation is great but the story is lackluster in everyway,"This movie is not a really bad film but it's not a good film. The film is overall not a great film so i will say it's ok at times but most of all it's bad. The good parts of the movie are the animation it's great and the movie is very visual to watch and while you watch it you love the animation. The bad parts are the story it's very short only 77 min, there is no point to the story and it's very lacluster, the voices are also very dull and have no life to them. The movie is a waste of time so dont bother watching it you wont be enertained."
3,a rainy day movie,"watched this one in the theaters and several times on DVD. I can't speak on the quality of the blu-ray package. Just for the movie part itself, this was touted as a second 'Nightmare Before Christmas"" when it was originally released -- Not So. This movie is a slower paced movie. While entertaining and original, this is a hard movie to sit still for. I recommend it for a rainy day when you're tired and don't feel like doing anything but lounge. This is a good 'background noise' movie."
2,Disappointed : (,"I am sad to say, that only after watching this dvd once - it wouldn't play for me any longer. I've updated my blue-ray player thinking that it must've needed one. But after all that & trying it again the dvd wouldn't work. I'm sad because I really liked this movie and it's been a long time since I last seen it. But I had to buy a regular dvd and it sufficed.I don't know what was wrong with the product, but it must've just been only mine."
3,joyjoyjoy,mr burton continues his passion for all things gothic and cutely grotesque...an eclectic cast of voices bring great poignancy and breeziness to the whole exercise..with smart tributes thrown in..(the piano depp's character plays is called 'harryhausen'..in homage to the great ray harryhausen)..and the maggot has a strange peter lorre-esqe-ness to it(or is it just me)...ha..all in all a greatly enjoyable fable told with all the luminosity of the wide eyed frizzy hairedness of mr burtons grey cells..
4,pretty cool little flick,"i saw the previews for this movie and said ""it should be pretty cool"". it is cool and good but much too short and the ending of it is kind of sad. this isn't nightmare before x-mas (which is a classic) but it's good enough with nice work from johnny depp, emily watson, helena bonham carter, mike johnson and of course tim burton. you don't have to be into the gothic world to enjoy movie (but i'm sure come halloween all the goth freaks will hail this in someway or another). aside from it being a little too short and a sad kind of sad ending, it's a good flick and worth renting if not owning."
3,interesting&Quick,I watched this film recently&the timing went by truly quickly.now Tim Burton's film takes elements from his past works.I think he hit his peak back in the day.the soundtrack sounds like the usual ones for Burton's films.Danny Elfman's scores still sound the same.it was a interesting wedding.fast paced film.
2,No Nightmare Before Christmas,I'll give it 2 stars for the excellent animation but other than that it was just horrible.
2,Amusing For Once,"The story concept is way above average, the animation is about average, the energy level is corpse-compatible. On the whole, Corpse Bride is entertaining enough to sit through once--especially if you're 10 or under. But if your cake has ever had 20 candles or more, once will likely do it for you."
3,DISAPOINTED BUT OH WELL!,"I am very disapointed in this film... being a huge fan of TIM BURTON and NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS I guess the problem was I expected way too much..I expected NBC part two actually.. knowing it wouldn't be that.. I still expected it..what I think we got here was a side project done completely while he had the actors from THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY on hand.. and was just kinda thrown together.. even the music sounded strangely like the music from WONKA.. ELFMAN never sounded so unoriginal..don't get me wrong this movie is a decent movie.. I just had way too high of an expectation for it..the only song I really cared for was the one the bride sang.. IF I TOUCH A BURNING CANDLE I CAN FEEL NO PAIN, CUT ME WITH A KNIFE IT'S ALL THE SAME.... (that sounds like my own lyrics.. so I loved that one)"
3,Good for what it was!,"It is a no-brainer that this is a good movie. For the most part we never get to see a movie made like this. I feel that the main flaw was that it just doesn't hold a candle to Nighmare before Christmas...I guess I just expected a deeper connection with the characters. Still, a move that the younger crowd can enjoy again and again."
3,My kids like it more than I do,"'Corpse Bride' is good Tim Burton, but a little too much like 'Nightmare Two' for my taste. The characters are a little flat, and the all-grey-thing is getting old quickly. Some very good one-liners, and a few memorable moments, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as my children (ages 6 and 9) did."
4,Movie review,"The kids liked the movie, as an adult, it was okay. It is a good family moviedo of you have nothing better to do give it a watch."
2,Not Tim's Best....,Tim burton...is a great director and creator. But this movie along with charlie and the chocolate factory were by far his weakest movie yet.The movie is about a guy name victor. he is about to get married. but then meets this dead girl emily. She is all like aHH! im deaD! and he s all like.. AHH... so the movie get progressivly worse and then they burst into some cool songs.all in all its an ok film with great animation and some funny jokes.i say go by edward sissorhands starring johny deep and wynona ryder. its a LOT BETTER....jared
2,"Dissapointing, but still fun","As a huge Tim Burton fan, I was expecting more than this. The plot seems awfully familiar...of Tim Burton's other animated film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. It's as if somebody took a plot synopsis from that movie and simply changed a few things around, threw in a few dozen plot holes, and robbed the characters of anything interesting. The Danny Elfman songs also sounded like spoiled Nightmare leftovers.Luckily, there are some plusses. The animation is beautiful and the gags are very funny. This is a Tim Burton movie, so there is bound to be some amazing twisted visuals, and the goods are delivered there. It's still a major dissapointment, though."
1,No Closed Captions or English Subtitles for Additional Features,Additional features are subtitled only in French.Movie does have Closed Captions.Tim Burton is CHEAP not to caption everything! Don't buy...only rent or borrow or wait until appears on TV.
2,"""I LOVE THIS MOVIE"" ""IT'S SO GOTH!""","First off, that title was a complete mockery of the fools who watch this movie and consider it goth, don't enjoy it, and wear the related apparel so they can be considered cool by other ""goths"". While watching this movie I didn't think for one second that it was goth at all. This is mainstream crap that trys to appeal to to many different groups at once, and fails at all attempts. The songs were very boring and forgettable. Plus, the movie spawned a whole horrifying army of prep-turned-'goths' who wear ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride"" because it was the first thing they saw at that one 'cool store', Hot Topic, thus making themselves cool among so called friends who only like them because they're popular. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was and is extremely overrated. While it is a somewhat enjoyable movie, is does not accomplish anything by the end and is just another animated movie."
1,best show,HaHaHa!my mother brought me to watch 'The Corpse Bride'yesterday.I eat a lot of potato chips on that day.This show is very funny;must watch.
2,Didn't like the story.,"Got this movie on a reccomendation from a friend, and huge fan of this movie.It's a good movie, with a great presentation and great effects, voices, acting, etc etc etc.I just didn't care for the story itself. There are no real flaws, mind you. The characters are well fleshed out, interesting, and the plot is original, but I couldn't get into it and I didn't like it. It's kind of odd, because I loved ""Nightmare Before Christmas."""
5,Classic Tim Burton Movie,"The movie is visually and thematicaly very dark. Black, gray, and blue during most of the movie. Tim Burton has an amazing way of making something ugly on the outside, something we shudder in fear at first glance into something truly amazing and unrecognizably wonderful on the inside. Also, he tends to add themes to the story. Here, there's the concepts of marriage for love (not monetary gain), getting to know someone before you cast judgment on them, and again, the concept of inner beauty. I love the skeletons in the movie, because it gives the impression that death is kinda fun, as a new beginning in a different body. Anyone who saw The Nightmare Before Christmas will definetely love this one!!!"
4,brilliant work,this sort of animation is fascinating! you watch it and love it...and then think about all the hard work that's gone on to make this into a MOVIE! it's amazing! the cast is great...Johnny Depp never ceases to impress...special features are a real treat! the music and script is very clever!
5,Hilarious!,"I found this movie really funny and charming with a great storyline. It's visually stunning and I found it amazing to watch. Notice also how the world of the living is somber and gray while the world of the dead is colorful and fun making for an intersting contrast. The ending is powerful and has a great message though I am not sure this movie is suitable for small children. Also if you or your older kids happen to be really wimpy about gore etc, I suppose it could be considered mildly gross. However, my parents were not too strict and I would have LOVED this as a kid. I'm not a parent myself but I am an Aunt and I would love to show this to my neices. I thought it was cute from beginning to end and I loved it!"
3,a different view,this was kinda stupid this man walks into a graveyard i think been a while. any way he puts a ring on a twig to practice proposing. the twig end up being a corpse's finger and she thinks he proposed to her. don't get me wrong this is a nice kids movie. she then brings him to the dead world. and he tries to get out but he can not. until the end.
4,"Pretty good, but be warned.....","I read the reviews before I went to see this movie today. I am glad I did. My wife was expecting 'Nightmare Before Christmas' or something like that. I wasn't. She mildly enjoyed the film while I enjoyed it more (for what it was). It is NOT Nightmare or really anything like it. If you had to relate it to a previous Burton work, I would call it more of Beetlejuice goes to Halloween Town (Nightmare).The humor in this is far more subtle. Don't expect any belly laughs. It is a good story. As may other reviewers have already stated, you will be wishing Victor could have both brides as they have both managed to steal your heart by the end.In the past, I have seen Burton's work first thinking ""Ok..... that was interesting."" Later, I tend to get the movie when it comes out on video / DVD. It really grows on me then. Nightmare was like that. The only one I can say didn't was James and the Giant Peach. This movie is far better than JatGP. I give it 4.5 stars.Enjoy!"
4,"Good, but a little short...","Recently we went to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. It's a stop-motion animation flick, similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas.It's thoroughly entertaining, great family fare. The only knocks I have against it are its length--it is short--and it has a pretty linear and predictable plot. The voice actors turn in good performances. Danny Elfman does a great job, as always, with the music. The movie features a great colour scheme, evoking a grey, Victorian style in the land of the living, and a more colourful land of the dead.It's a great family film, as I said. However, it could be scary for very young kids. Kids under 5 shouldn't be at the movies anyways."
4,Masterpiece...,"Tim Burton has created yet another wonderful peice of work. Seriously, can he go wrong?I love this movie, Its dark, creepy, funny, fun, addictive, and just plain GOOD. It has that same gothic and morbid feel to it that Tim Burton has a way of making you love, and want more of. Its a little creepy, too. Theres plenty of humor, music, and decomposing and/or severed body parts throughout this movie. That's what makes it so great! Good fun for anybody who watches it."
4,Almost A 5,"I hadn't seen this movie or had any interest in seeing it unitl I bought a Playstation 3 and wanted to test the Blu-ray player with movies that were said to have the best conversions. This movie was rated as one of the best from multiple sources. I was a huge fan of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" so I decided to give it a try. It's visually spectacular and the sound is amazing. The story line is growing on me as well. I've watched it now a couple of times and it gets better with every viewing. My television is a 1080i and I am using an HDMI cable. It is well worth the purchase."
5,Good movie good packaging,Good packaging good deal. I recommend it for everybody.. . . . . . . . . . . . .
5,Amazing,"I love this movie of brilliance. How did they make all of the characters come to life? A true story to love over and over again. This is my favorite movie and has been for years. I am always finding new things to love every time I watch it. You don't just watch this movie, you feel it too."
4,Cool,"I liked this movie. Corpse Bride has a better story, a deeper characters and cooler special effects than Tim Burton's other claymation movie, the Nightmare Before Christmas.This HD DVD has excellent video quality. The picture is very sharp."
4,Tim Burtons wedding flick,This was just good fun. We always enjoy everything Burton does. Not scary for even the little kids.
4,A Little Dark,"The stop motion clamation animation they used for this film is terrific. It is also light years ahead of Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas as far as that goes. I liked the twisted little tale, but I think some of the younger viewers might not be up for such a morbid tale. Fine voice work and a really interesting and unique tale are the high points. The flat gray tones are carried throughout the picture, so much so that you almost feel like you are watching a black and white feature. This movie is very short, running about 70 minutes minus the credits. It is worth a purchase if you like off beat and original tales."
1,I'm sorry Tim...,"I love Tim Burton movies, but this one I'm sorry to say was very boring. It was very slow too... The storyline was simple, but I kept getting distracted from the movie because of my boredom. This is not a movie for those that bore easily."
2,Perfect for shallow characters and an emotionally detached audience,"Though the movie had its charm, I was bothered by it. The onset of the film established a gloomy tone which prevailed throughout, which would have worked well if there had existed some kind of comic relief at all. I spent the entire second act feeling sorry for all of the principal characters and without any humor it just weighed me down. Again, if there had been any humor element at all, it wouldn't have been such a downer.The villainous character receives his dues at the end in a last-ditch effort to satisfy the audience. It was so contrived. He brings about his own demise by grabbing a sitting goblet and drinking it, without any real idea of its contents. It felt like a simplistic device to bring about what the audience was naturally waiting for.The songs were forgetable too."
4,corpse bride,"i bought this movie for my 7 year old. She thought this was the best Tim Burton movie she had seen, ""Nightmare before christmas"", has been a favorite movie of hers since she first saw it last year. Great movie for the Haloween season, or Valintines day."
5,corpse bride bluray,"""bluray disc"" pretty good quality, very detailed, nice colors... the sound is pretty good too, I highly recommended it!"
4,"Great movie, though a bit too short","This is a brilliant film but Burton/Elfman/Depp. The animation is astounding, the music is catchy and riveting, and the overall atmosphere is creepy and beautiful. The only problem I had with this was that it was a bit too short: just less than 80 minutes. It could've been a bit better if there were 15 more minutes of film. But anyway, ""Corpse Bride"" is another dazzling accomplishment by Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Danny Elfman. A definite must-see. A-"
5,Excellent on Blu-Ray,"This Blu-Ray version is much better than the dvd. The clarity is SUPERB. It really doesn't do it justice to try to describe it. It's like trying to compare a steak to a hamburger. You just gotta watch it. By the way, I especially liked the behind-the-scenes making of the movie and seeing the clay puppets being put together frame by frame."
2,a chore to sit through,"I saw THE CORPSE BRIDE this evening. I thought it was an absolute -chore- to sit through.Visually it's nice... at times. The character design is uneven, but the Corpse Bride herself is sometimes quite beautiful on screen.Storywise, it's just dreadful. Slow. Predictable. Not funny. Plus there are a number of garish song and dance numbers which are not entertaining.For all the time and effort put into this type of production, they should've made sure the story was charming and compelling. It was just a bore.Keep in mind, I also think NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is slow and boring. Visually, I give CORPSE BRIDE 4 stars. Story gets only one.PS - It's funny how readers give ""no votes"" to negative reviews. But all the ""no votes"" don't make this movie any better."
1,NOT BUYING THIS DVD FOR SURE!!,"Don't get me wrong!1 star for DVD release, 5 stars for the movie..I loved this movie & loved ""Nightmare before Christmas"" both great and very good scrip and animation ...but beware people if u DVD collector like I am, After almost 2 weeks number one in box office. They came out with this bare bone DVD...If u look at the past of his ""TIM BURTON DVDS"" most of them is double disk or special edition ...so means Most likely they going To another DVD version down the road, like ""Double disk special edition ""or ""EXTENDED Cut""! IF u didn't see it, just rent it for now! ""DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!. Guess better be safe then sorry, this is another studio doubledip style of DVD releases these days..and suck up more money from us!just B.S"
1,Need region number next to DVD,"Can't play DVD in Austrlia. I bought it when I was new to Amazon and I would loose money sending it back for a refund. As the page was emailed to a Australian address, I thought I would be able to play it. I have learnd the hard way. It would be good if only 'any region' Blu Ray titles could be emailed out to those in region 2."
3,Realllly Annoying!,"I just watched this a couple days ago and I have been waiting forever to see this. I was sure it was gonna be a masterpiece like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The songs were annoying and loud, it was freaky short, and it was just plain stupid. It was kinda funny at some points but it was just soooooooooooooooo annoying! When I got home I had a headache."
2,"But I haven't seen the DVD, why am I rating it?????","Because - in response to other commentators/reviewers - I will wait for the multiple disc edition (like LOTR, Sin City - and I am still waiting politely for Kill Bill and if a real DVD set doesn't get issued I won't be buying it at all- I have been caught too often in the past to fall for this marketing technique any more). For those who get the January release, you will obviously get the film and a tiny amount of extras more quickly and if speed is the only object that's great!"
4,Fun movie and special features,My kids watched this movie 2-3 times within the first two weeks of receiving it. They love the special features.
1,analytical methods in vibrations,"1. the ""book"" is actually a paperback. at $90 + it is a rip off - but then, most text books are.2. I was interested in using the book for real problems, mostly it is more about enhancing the reputation of the author with elegant proofs ... etc ...3. I was interested in Holzer's Method for Torsional Vibration and after several pages of obscure terminology, it mentioned that the equations could be solved by two methods but without examples or specifics.4. definitly not a Schaum's Outline."
5,The other reviewer is a ton of garbage!,"This is an excellent and serious documentary of Hugh Hefner and the revolution that he inspired. Fascinating insights into his being a man of the 1950s and how we was blindsided by the feminist revolution of the 1960s. He thought he was liberating the ""girl-next-door"" from the ""Madonna vs Whore"" dichotomy, only to be accused of objectifying women. Thought-provoking!"
1,Ton of Garbage,You can listen to the endless rantings of a man (Hefner) and his rise in the adult entertainment business. It's garbage.
4,katrina up close and personal,"After having spent the time between Christmas and New Year's on a mission trip to the 9th Ward, I was curious to see photos etc of the area during the storm and immedidatley thereafer. This DVD showed many areas of New Orelans and Mississippi and the devestation left behind. It gave a good background of the government's response (or lack thereof), however, it seemed to use the same photo's over and over again, instead of new ones. Overall I found it very informative and would recommend."
1,substandard look at a powerful event,"This could've have been so much more, instead it is just a flashy piece of news footage repeated over and over....very repetitive. Spike Lee's ""When the Levee's Broke"" is much more substantive."
5,IT'S AWESOME!,I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL CD! JOHN P.KEE IS MY MOST FAVORITE GOSPEL SINGER! THE NEW LIFE COMMUNITY CHOIR IS A GREAT CHOIR!! WELL GOTTA GO! SEE YA!!!
5,best shoes ever,I bought these shoes because I heard from other nurses how great they were and I needed a leather shoe for safety sake. I am so pleased with them that I now have been recommending them to everyone.
4,Very slow exchange,"The sizing charts on amazon are different than on clogs central. Follow the one on clogs central. I wear a 9 and ordered a 39 which was too small. I sent them back the next day and had to pay a lot for shipping, it has been a week since the company received my shoes and no word that they have processed my order yet. If you need to exchange your shoes, beware its going to take weeks."
3,Poor quality,"I have purchased 2 pair of dansko professional shoes in the past 6 months. They fit differently and the piping on 1 pair is coming off- so I carry a Sharpie marker to hide the defect. For the price, these should wear better!"
1,Not very happy!!!,"I have worn Dansko's for over 20 years and never had any problems. They have always been my favorite most comfortable shoes and well worth the cost. In the last year I have had 3 pairs of Dansko's less than 3 years old fall apart suddenly. It is like the soles just disintergrated. I store my shoes in boxes w/ silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated. I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly. I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also. I gather Dansko has changed the material for the soles in the last few years and it is common for this ""dryrot"" issue to occur."
1,used shoes for new price,Don't buy these from Amazon. My wifes pair arrived packaged nicely in the original box but it was clear that the shoes had been worn before. The leather on the left shoe was stretched by someone walking in them and they missed a spot when they wiped off the bottom. White is a hard color to clean dirt from so it was obvious. There was also a nice sweat/dirt line just inside the left shoe. If this pair would have been offered at a shoe store I would have asked for a different pair or a discount. I will no longer trust Amazon for a new shoe purchase.
2,What is all the fuss about?,"I have heard nothing but good things about these shoes but when I bought a pair and put them on, I just couldn't stand them. I bought a half size larger because I have a wider foot but they just dug into my instep like a torture device. Perhaps they are only for people with narrow feet and low insteps."
2,Shoe it too SHORT,"I ordered this shoe,,, the quality is great... but sizing is WAY off.. I ordered a size 11.... however... there is a discrepancy on the EURO sizing... I have made many attempts to buy Euro sizing in other brands... too risky and not standard. I have an American foot."
3,"Great shoes, bad communication","I love Danskos because of their superior comfort.But, I got the incorrect size and color in the mail - it was REALLY wrong. Turns out, they were out of the shoe I ordered. I guess they just send what they want to. I returned them, and ordered from another Dansko store, eliminating the amazon middle man (sometimes he gets the messages confused!)"
2,Will dye your socks,"I have bought white pair few years ago and loved it so much I wanted another pair. However, I have recently tried 3 new pairs of Dansko clogs (all dark colors) and they all dye my socks. They are extremelly comfortable but I hated to see my white socks dyed after few hours of wearing the clogs. I returned the shoes (black and blueberry colors) and ended up with Dansko Nubuck in light blue. The inside is light brown. That too does dye my socks, but at least it is not black.It is still the most comfortable work shoe I have ever owned, but be ready to see your white socks black."
2,vinyl piping covering is coming off,"first off for $120.00 there should not even be any vinyl on them but the plastic vinyl covering the piping is coming off after 1 month of use so i will need to use a black marker to hide it dansko was great till they left sanita now they are cheaply made in china,hungry,italy,and they dont even fit these are some of the problems i have found over the last 3 months i have tried aprox 50 pairs of dansko cabrio professional i should be waring a 37 (us size 7) but now i cant,i need a 38 and most of the 38 are too small also 1 shoe bigger than the other in some pairs the left is tight and the right shoe feels great and in some pairs the right is too tight and the left feels great then after of 3 months and 50 pairs of trying on the pair i did keep the VINYL piping is coming off dansko is no longer good i will now only buy sanita COME ON DANSKO YOU ARE TAKING THE CHEEP AND EASY and you soon will loose customers"
2,Smh,I like these shoes but recently they have gotten tight!! Or my feet are swollen I wear them with thin socks and they still are a pain
1,Dont buy Dansko's on line!,"Dansko's have a great reputation but buying them on line is a bad idea. Dansko's need to be tried on as they are individually made and sizes are very difficult to judge. I ordered a pair that I thought would fit perfectly, they were too small and I had to reorder my shoes. And return the original pair. I made my initial order on August 29, 2009. Today is September 29, 2009 and I have not received my shoes. All of my friends that wear Dansko's love them but have urged me never to buy them on line again."
4,Inconsistent Sizing,"I loved these shoes and was so sad that I had to return these. I loved the shoe, but the right shoe was noticeably larger than the left - same size. I never have this issue with other shoes. I ended up returning and getting a different color in oiled leather & they fit fine.Only taking one start off because the sizing should be consistent."
2,All Dansko's are not created equal...,"Was disappointed that these Dansko's are not as comfortable as my other pair of Dansko's. These run a little big and slide on my heel. Also, the top rubs the top of my instep and something about them makes the top of the bottom of my left foot sore. Will still try another pair of Dansko's later, however."
1,Made in China,"My wife ordered these to wear to work. She is on her feet almost continually. When they didn't fit as well as the REAL Dansko's she was replacing, we looked inside and saw why. MADE IN CHINA was stenciled on the uppers. We got our money back but no wonder they were such a good ""bargain"". Always make certain they are not knockoffs when you buy. The original Dansko's are great shoes for working people."
4,sturdy Dansko,I have owned several Dansko Clogs and this one like all the others is a great quality item. Just a little stiff to break in at first.
4,Buy some no-show socks,"I've been dealing with so much heel pain for so many months now; I don't even know I HAVE heels in these shoes. My high arches are happy for possibly the first time in their lives. They're awesome. Wish they were a little 'prettier,' but that's a small quibble.The one problem I did have--which was so annoying I almost returned them after about a week, but was thinking they were too 'worn' even by then--is that they squeaked. LOUDLY. I thought it was just the shoes and bad manufacturing, but then a friend of mine suggested I buy some of those no-show socks/peds that are everywhere these days. And BAM. No more squeaking. And the socks are super comfy; I don't usually wear socks because they 'squeeze' my feet and I get cramps. (Yes, I'm a delicate flower.) But these are perfect, and now I wear the shoes all the time and am saving up for another pair. Big fan!"
2,Just not the same,"I just recently purchased a pair of the Dansko professional oiled leather clogs. When they arrived I tried them on, it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller. The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same. I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them."
5,Keepers,"I tore my right achilles tendon 20 years ago, resulting in severely limited ankle motion. I wore backless clogs for years, for comfort, but developed plantar fasciitis, due to clenching my toes to keep the clogs on.Most shoes that felt good were just plain homely.I went into a local shoe shop a couple years ago, checked these out, and figured if they were good for nurses, I would give them a try. They are durable, and actually quite nice looking with jeans and work wear. My days of wearing heels ended with an injury, but I most likely did my other foot a favor by switching to a comfy supportive shoe.My old ones are 3 years old now, and getting kinda worn, but they are so comfortable, I still put them on for non-formal work days. I recently bought two more pairs, and want them in every color. It might take a month or so to wear them in till they feel like a well loved pair of jeans, but they are worth it."
2,"I really, really wanted to like these shoes.","I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel. I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around. They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT, they are terrible for my ankles. When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times. They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on. I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these, but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability."
4,Won't walk without them,"The Dansko Professional Clog is the only shoe I can wear for the entire day and still be happy at the end of the day. I love these shoes and I own them in every color, (almost). Buy and be comfortable!"
2,Not what I expected,"I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color. After wearing it for an entire shift at work, I developed blisters. I felt that the insole were hard. I was disappointed with this particular style. I like the color."
5,Great for medical profession,I'm a third year medical student and spend tons of time on my feet walking & standing. These shoes are fantastic for keeping my feet and lower back happy. A must-have for medical school.
1,Very uncomfortable shoes,"These shoes were advertized as being very comfortable. Nothing could be further from the truth. They were so uncomfortable that I can no longer wear them. I even tried to have them professionally stretched twice,to no avail. They are very tight over the top of your foot. OUCH!! What a waste of $100."
1,Quality has dropped,"I used to buy them for my whole office but, we have noticed a big difference in quality. The company use to be a lot more personably and cared about each customer. I had a very bad experience with one of the managers there. There are plenty of really good shoe companies so, bye bye Dansko."
4,Dansko Women's Clog,"The Dansko product has proven to be a superior all weather shoe for my daughter who lives in New England. Shipping was timely, the delivery condition was excellent, and the price was compelling."
5,satisfied parent,Both of my high school daughters have these shoes and wear them to school every day with their school uniform. They are very comfortable and you can keep them looking great with an oiled brush. One daughter wore them to school every day last year and they still look great. They are also very durable.
5,Perfect...as usual!,"I am totally addicted to Dansko shoes. After suffering with back, leg and knee pain for years, I decided to try them. OMG! I've bought 6 pair since January...love them!"
3,Difficult to obtain good fit for some sizes,"This is a wonderful shoe, however due to the European sizing, each size covers two US sizes. Had to return for next smaller size which was a little snug."
5,The Best for Arch Pain and Long Walks,These shoes are the best ! I have high arches and supportive shoes are hard to find. These shoes provide excellent support and are well worth the money. I do a lot of airline travel and these shoes are perfect when going through airport security - just simply slip them off and put them on again. Great for those long trips through airport concourses. I can't recommend then enough - they're simply the best and are extremely difficult to wear out (I found a place online that can repair the soles). Treat your feet to the most comfortable shes available!
5,SHOES ARE GREAT BUT A RECOMMENDATION,"These shoes are as good as everyone else says. They are worth every penny especially for those who work on their feet all day. However, I recommend finding a store locally that sells these and go try them on. I buy everything from Amazon and bought a pair of these. The sizes vary a little since they are handmade. I bought my first pair from Amazon and based on other recommendations chose a size. They were just a little too tight and caused my feet to ache. I had to send them back. I went into a local shop and the owner recommended trying on a couple pair of the same size. One pair the left was perfect and the other pair the right was perfect. She let me take the best two and said it was common. Perhaps not everyone has had an issue like this, but I am more than pleased with these shoes now that I have proper fitting ones."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"A good old fashioned drop a big rock on the planet type of story. Astronomical, rather than alien-deliberate in this case.Scientist types have to convince people that if this happens, it will be bad, and see if they can do something about it in time."
4,Tension filled book,"Great book. A quick read with a good ""what if"" situation. The characters could have been more developed, but that's a small flaw."
3,"good, but","This really was a good story...However I have become spoilt with my chosen authors...There seemed to be large chunks of detail left out...My father would say ""use your imagination"" but that is why I read...to envision, not imagine."
4,"A quick, yet satisfying read","This is not Matheson's best work. That doesn't mean that it's bad, it just has a tough act to live up to in ""I Am Legend"". Even ""Hell House"" was a better book, especially in terms of pacing. So, what does this book have to offer? A story that's just as good today as the day it was written.This is a fairly creepy read, but not really scary. It raises some good questions, and makes me glad I'm not telepathic. You really feel bad for the protagonist after a while. People can be so ugly on the inside...I've never seen the movie, so I can't comment on that. But I do plan to see it, and expect to be disappointed as always!A great light read, without the impact of a lot of his other works."
3,disappointing,"I read this book hoping it would be scary, but it wasn't at all! There were no chilling moments and the ending was somewhat of a letdown, although unexpected. Despite this, I didn't feel reading the book was too much of a waste of time. It was okay but not great."
1,The movie was better,"I found this book to be so boring and half the time I found myself skimming the paragraphs. Nothing really happened till the end and it just seemed rushed when it finally came. The characters were boring and I didn't like the fact that he kept apologizing to his wife because he was having trouble sleeping and waking up scared and seeing things. Really? I just don't get it, she seemed like an uncaring selfish b*&ch... Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I'd rather watch the movie and recommend that. At least the movie was entertaining."
3,Very spooky and thought provoking,"Kevin Bacon does an excellent job of developing his character and I really feel sorry for him as he slowly starts coming apart because of all the pain that comes from his new psychic abilities. Maybe if people were more accepting of psychic abilities,he wouldn't have some many problems"
1,Don't waste your time with this read!,"The writing was awful, the plot boring, and the whole book was poorly constructed! I was laughing in parts of it...not sure how this author got published in the mainstream...a real disappointment!"
2,Not for Me,"Although I absolutely love the movie, I wasn't impressed by the book. Not quite as spooky, and too many details were so different from the movie that I couldn't get used to it. It might appeal to others, though, especially if you've never seen the movie starring Kevin Bacon!"
2,It's not light reading,I'm trying to get into this book. I just find it rather rambling. I read about 1 or 2 pages a night and then fall asleep. Gripping it is not.
5,No Dissent: This is a Great Book,"No point in blabbing on. Everyone agrees that this is a great book. In High Fiedlity, John Cusack kids that it's ""about girls, right?"" Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. Of the Marquez books I've read, ""100 Years"" and ""Chronicle of a Death Foretold,"" this is the funniest. The story tells of Florentino's decades long love for Fermina. During his long wait, Florentino has sex with just about every woman in Colombia, but remains emotionally faithful to Fermina, who marries the stable but dull and passive aggressive Dr. Urbino. What I took from the story is the lesson of how some people exchange passion for stability, while others do the opposite. And can two such people live a life together? Anyway, that's my humble, non-MFA take on it. I might be missing the point. In any case, Marquez is South America's most famous living writer for a reason. Read this book to see why."
5,Fantastic Book!,"This is an awesome novel, the first I've read by Marquez. The rich language and original phrases are a treat to anyone searching for a beautiful, poignant literary work. It is honest to the point of being embarassing at times, yet still poetic and rich with history. It will captivate you for the entire reading! My first experience with this author was his short story, ""The Very Old Man with Enormous Wings,"" which I also loved!"
4,Enchanting,"Almost everything Florentino Ariza has done in his adult life has been for Fermina Daza, Ariza's young love who shunned him decades ago. Florentino Ariza's devotion has lasted through his rise up the occupational ladder, stagnant disapproval from Fermina Daza's father, several meaningless erotic affairs, Daza's marriage to the stern intellectual, Dr. Jubinal Urbino, and fifty years. This impressive, convincing and charming love story acts as a vehicle for Marquez's vivid descriptive powers. While reading this book one feels as if he or she is smelling the perfumed letters; breathing in the wet, moist mornings; tasting the fried fish and feeling the sticky air. Marquez effectively casts his spell and the reader is ensnared with with Florentino Ariza and his feelings of longing and misery."
4,"Great book, slow burning","This book took a while to getting going and I almost gave up at the beginning, which would have been a huge mistake. It turned out to be an amazing book. Deserving of all its accolades."
3,A Shame after all...,"Note: Spoiler...don't continue if you haven't read the novel.Like most of the reviews I enjoyed the writing and story of ""Love.."" until I came upon the systematic seduction of Florentino's protege. This was child molestation in any language. I thought that for this transgression Florentino would be denied his Holy Grail. I was wrong and so disappointed. Although, I often am not in moral alignment with fictional characters, this particularly offensive form of evil left a bad taste in my mouth. The victim was destroyed, but the perpetrator lived happily ever after."
3,Hmmm....,"Well, when I began this book I was a highschool freshman, and I found it extremely difficult. It's not because I read ""young adult"" books, that's not the case. I've read ""Gone with the Wind"", ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"", ""Rebecca"", ""Great Expecations"", and the list goes on. I just found it kind of tasteless, but then again, I might not have given it enough time. Try it if you're ready for a difficult read!"
3,A little dissapointing,"I have to say that I LOVE Garcia Marquez. I've read ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" about a zillion times. But this book somehow didn't do it for me. I found it too slow and a little boring. Also, in my opinion, the characters appeared too crule for the 'love story' theme to be touching enough. I think Garcia Marquez should better be remembered for his much more beautifully crafted, earlier works."
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING","This is the worst book I've ever read. I put it down half way through and read something else. Then I went back to it. Still awful. I shared it with two friends and they couldn't finish it either. It was boring, the writing is terrible and the story is preposterous. Save your money (and time) read anything by Jodi Picoult and enjoy!"
2,Love it or hate it,"This is the favorite book of a friend of mine, she rereads it every year. She chose it for our bookclub, and the rest of us hated it! I think this is the best example I know of a book that either really connects with you, or doesn't at all. I have a degree in Eng. Lit. and certainly have encountered a number of books written in a unique or poetic style that I loved, but this one was for me rambling, full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and, since I didn't like a single character, I never felt invested in anything that happened to them. For others what was tedium for me, was poetry. I made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub, but it was like taking medicine--still I can see that every word was a joy for my friend. This isn't a matter of being good or bad, its obviously a masterpiece for some, but if it isn't your kind of writing, you will find it more than a chore to get through."
3,Started off good.... but,"This book infuzzed a love of reading in me, for the first 200 pages. Then I grew bored with the details and just wanted to know how the story ended.The beginning is excellent, the middle and end however are left to be desired."
2,Couldn't finish it,"It was a difficult read for me. Due to the time period and wording after translation, I just couldn't get into the book. I'm sure that other people may have had a great experience reading it. Unfortunately, Cholera just wasn't my cup of tea."
1,Love in the Time of Cholera,"Very disjointed book and difficult to get into let alone read through. I must have missed the point somehow. The book seems badly structured, so bad infact, I doubt that I will ever finish reading it. Note: Supplier: delivery and condition of the book were very good."
3,So very long,"I know, really I do, that this is a gifted author. So, it must be my simple tastes that leave me to say that this book went on and on and on . . . Really, every character was described in full detail, even characters who just weren't that important to the story. There were so many times I nearly stopped reading. So many. The story is, of course, lovely and tragic and all. I just found myself saying, ""Please don't tell me all about the uncle. Oh, no!! Not again. This is too much information!"" Then, there was some disturbing pedophilia that maybe wasn't supposed to bother me? So, I finished it. There."
2,Muddied by the author's writing style,"This book could have been great. However, you have to wade through piles and piles of non-essential rubbish to get to the meat of the story (which could have been told in about 1 chapter. Not romantic, but very James Joyce in that the characters are flawed, unhappy people who you're not sure should be together at all. The most difficult thing about this book is the lack of editorial advice. It needs more chapter breaks, less digression, something to make it flow better. Took me a LONG time to finish, and I'm not happy I wasted all of that time when I could have read something more fulfilling."
2,Booooooooooooring,"I really like and respect Gabriel Garcia Marquez books, but I find this one sort of boring and over elaborating.The book is a love story and I did nt like the characters that much. I found them very stupid, selfish and wasted.I think if you are interested to know about the book just watch the movie, which BTW did not do well in box office.and one more thing, the book was not really an easy read I had to open up dictionary few times!"
2,Not with a bang but with a wimper,"This book is the worst type of book; it starts brilliantly, with the premise and smell of unrequited love, but then it just dies. I felt such relief at finishing, not because- thank God- I know ""what happens"" but because in good conscience I can now put it away and not have that hankering orange cover staring up at me from my bedstand. I do not mean to suggest that it is a bad book. It is not. But it fails to deliver on its opening promise. And, we never get to know the characters in any capacity greater than their actions. I have no idea if I like or dislike any of the three main characters. In fact, I don't think I care because I couldn't recognize them walking down the street. I felt betrayed by this book. Why couldn't it have been better?"
2,Slow and not what I expected,I think the book went way too slow. It came highly recommended and I was disappointed. It was the kind of book that I just made myself read because I don't like to just stop a book half way through.
3,"very well written, but at times boring...","Gabriel Garcia Marquez has an enviable ability to describe any banal situation in ways that most of us couldn't even dream. This book was more interesting to read for the writing style than for anything else. The characters were nearly interesting, and the plot was similar. He didn't quite live up to his reputation, however (not for me, anyway)."
2,An unpleasant surprise...,"As an avid reader, I could not wait to get my hands on a copy of a book that had been recommended to me a thousand times. I devoured the first chapter, and admit it had its brilliant points, but as the book progressed I found it to be banal and tedious. The characters, described by some as ""wonderfully flawed"" come across as contrived and ridiculous. The author's extraordinary talent for prose is tarnished by his particular taste for describing the ugly parts of life and failing. If you are looking for a childish endeavour of a novel, veering into sexual activity as an attempt to keep interest but instead insulting intelligence, read this.Don't get me wrong, I know this is a cherished book by many, and I agree that his style has exceptional flair at points. Unfortunately it fell way below expectation; there is nothing deep about this book. The idea was enchanting, I get choked up just thinking about the storyline, but the execution is another matter."
2,Could not finish this book,"This book came highly recommended to me by two friends, whose opinions I respect. I just couldn't get into it. And I tried. I kept hoping it would get better and I would actually CARE what happened to the characters. I found Florentino Ariza to be irritating and whiny. I quit reading a little more than halfway through the book. I just couldn't finish it."
1,Is this really love?,"I persisted through this difficult reading thinking that there must be something, somewhere that would evoke the feelings entailed in all the great reviews for this book. What a horrible disappointment. This book shows ""love"" in all its profane forms: seduction and molestation of a minor, adolescent and unrequited lust, fornication during a time of mourning, adultery, a rape that ""enraptured"" the victim, promiscuity without the reality of STDs and unplanned pregnancies, along with ""love"" resulting in suicide and homicide. I hope the movie is vastly different from the book."
3,"Strong beginning, weak ending","I have just finished reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the first hundred or so pages, which set up a great story of unrequited love. The rest of the book was interesting enough, but had very few dramatic plot twists and an extremely unsatisfying ending. Considering the incredible importance given to Florentino Ariza's unending passions for Fermina Diaz, the eventual state of their romance by the end of the book seemed forced and unrealistic. Almost all of the characters have within them major flaws, which shouldn't be a problem, except none of the major characters seems to have much of a soul despite their constant musings on love and passion. I felt that this book was at least 75 pages too long, and did not find it particularly beautiful or fulfulling. Plenty of colorful language, but the evolution of the story was not to my taste."
2,Adulterous,"Perhaps the translation was not good. It almost seemed like the author was trying to prove to himself and the readers how eloquent and descriptive he could be. The whole book was overflowing with chapter-long descriptions and character analyses made by an omniscient narrator. For every effect, there was a cause that had to be explained for several pages. As if the author wanted to make certain that the reader was convinced of the complexity of the characters and situations. The first half was quite lovely, but when the adultery began, I became so tired of the characters and their actions. I read his novella, A Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor and thought it was excellent."
2,Not that great,"I was really disappointed with this book. I could hardly get through it. The first 25-30 pages have little (if anything) to do with the rest of the book. I have to question what the point was of the first 10 or so pages. Also, I don't ""buy"" the kind of love that this book is about - that someone would wile away the greater part of his life waiting for and being in love with the same woman. Hey, there are ""other fish in the sea"" - most people eventually move on. And the bit about a man in his 60's having and affair with the 14-year-old girl that he was supposed to protect and be responsible for. And then dropping her when the 70-year-old he's loved for 50+ years becomes available. Yeah, right! Some of the description was beautiful but the entire plot doesn't represent ""real life"" at all. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
1,not worth the time or money,"ugh. stupid oprah. should've read the one-star reviews first before purchasing it at the time. forced myself to read it in hopes there'd be some sort of enlightenment, but to no avail. read about fifty pages and quit."
3,This is not a love story.,This book is gross. I don't understand where the love story is. The guy is an obsessed pervert and the supposed romantic ending has nothing to do with love at all. There are so many disturbing images from this book that still haunt me.
2,Difficult to understand the personalities involved,"Recognizing that this author is of a totally different background and culture then I am, it was difficult for me to keep immersed in this as a love story. It had many twists and angles, but as for it being the true, undying love story of which I am usually attracted to, it didn't do it for me, and I am a Senior and can understand that Seniors can still love and feel passion. So I didn't really enjoy it."
2,"Ugh, sorry classic literature....this does not belong in the modern cannon","I really, really disliked this book, found it depressing and not inspiring like most modern classics that I've read. Another reviewer mentioned that it didn't feel ""happy"", I'm ok with that. Not every book can be hopeful, some darkness needs to balance-got it. Still found this dull and felt like I had lost hours that I couldn't get back."
5,A majestic wonder,"This is probably my favorite of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's works. In this book he is able to map out his charactors with idiosyncratic humor and a poignancy. Somehow every detail, no matter how unrealistic, seems possible. when you read this book, think about the differences between how people are perceived and how they really are. Also, think about the differences between our (people) ideals and fantasies, and the realities of our world. just a thought."
4,Stunning ending,"This book reminds me in some ways of East of Eden. While both kept my attention to the end, until the very end neither struck me as a great book. The endings of both books affirm life and love and dreams and humanity. The ending of ""Cholera"" is, in my opinion, perfect."
4,"An timeless love story about enduring love, worth reading.","A beautiful story, the author passionately evokes the scene and the characters are believable. Love that is unrequited is far more intense but the ending is sentimental and unforgetable. Read it."
2,pseudo-freudian analyis,"All things aside, an old man having sex with his young charge is weird to our eyes. This love is not the central concern in the book, but pops up in some reviews. I got this book because I read an earlier novel by the same writer and found that his work was fantastic....if only he chose something else to write about. Granted, the earlier book was much shorter, so when I thumbed throug hwith my right hand on what I had left, I was much more forgiving. This book, however, was hard to read. While GGM is a ""great writer"" in terms of how he writes, I don't care about the ""things"" he writes about. His topics make it hard for me to care."
1,I am so Happy!!!,"I am so happy I am not the only one who found this book repulsive and boring. I have been afraid to say anything because everyone says it is one of the best books ever written. It was definitely the best sedative I have ever experienced. It will be interesting to see a movie with little dialogue, no action and a very puny plot."
5,A Message For Modern Readers,"Here's a message for people out there who can't get through anything more challenging than a James Patterson thriller or a Dean Koontz horror book. Do not read anything written by the following authors:Gabriel Garcia MarquezJames JoyceCormac McCarthyRichard YatesVladimir NabokovLeo TolstoyFyodor DostoyevskyThomas MannWilliam ShakespeareGraham GreeneJulio CortazarWilliam FaulknerAlbert Camusetc...etc...etc......unless, of course, you learn to have some respect for good writing and for the blood, sweat, tears and heartache that go into creating great works of fiction. Have some respect. Try working on yourselves. Try shutting off your televisions. Try using the brain you were born with.And if you don't want to--FINE. Just continue reading crap and laughing over the latest reality junk that's being pawned off on you by cynical executives.But DON'T read literature.Do us all a favor."
3,Too slow!!,"I originally bought this book after watching the movie Serendipity. And then heard everyone say how great a love story it is. I was just so dissapointed. This book is really boring. Yes, it probably is quite romantic, as in true love never dies, bla bla bla. But im sorry, i really dont see what the fuss is all about. Its just too slow, too detailed, and i was actually relieved when i was done with it."
1,Boring...,This book was tedious and overwritten. The book did not flow nicely at all. I couldn't even finish it!!
3,Literary equivalent to being talked into a corner by a genius,"Imagine you are at a party. A man you don't know comes up to talk to you and at first you are very impressed with his story and his language. Then, after awhile you think ""yeah, great guy, but I need to go now"". THEN after an hour more, you want to crawl out of your shoes and go home and watch TV. But he won't shut up...This is how I felt reading this novel. LOVED parts of it but it just beat me to death. One affair after another, one character after another...it may be the first book I abandoned mostly with only 50 pages left (I skimmed the rest).Go ahead, read it, but be prepared for a challenge in patience."
2,"Major bore, Mainstream Pap","I had wanted to read this book for a long time, and when our bookclub choose it, I dove in. I found it only mildly interesting and entertaining. The parrot scence was amusing but I was soon too bored to continue. Every time I picked it up I wanted to put it down. The writing style is awkward and cumbersome, bogged down with excessive detail. I simply found nothing early on in this book to make me want to read further. Books like this kill my appetite for reading award-winners. I admit I didn't read very far, but my philosophy is that reading should be enjoyable and the book should capture my attention. It shouldn't be like trying to get yourself to clean your room. I was not happy with this selection at all."
1,well-written but so depressing,"I cannot even tell you how much i hated this book. Very depressing, and more a novel of sick obsession and loneliness than a ""great romantic love story."" I will say that it was very well-written, lots of detail and description, took a long time to read."
2,Eh....don't waste your time!,"I must say that I was disappointed with this book, especially considering all of the rave reviews. The first 50-60 pages had me very interested, and then...nothing. The book jumps all over the place back and forth in time and in between characters. The more I read about Florentino, the more I realized that he is a pervert who claims to be in love. I was also extremely disturbed with the sexual relationship he has with a 14 year old girl when he is in his 70's. I found myself becoming uninterested and bored very easily. It was difficult to finish, because reading this book became a chore. I won't be recommending this book to anyone."
3,"Vivid writing, slow plot","Several people recommended this book to me, saying it was like taking a holiday in the Caribbean. The writing does bring vivid imagry to my mind's eye and the characters are thoroughly developed, but to be honest, I have been trying to finish the book for months and the lack of plot is just dragging me down. I can only feel sympathetic for the whiney, romantic protagonest for so long with out losing interest."
1,"Dull, over-written and overly sentimental",I read this book as part of my local book club it is boring and the main characters are uninspiring. It is so bad I wonder if the author genuinely thinks it is a love story because I cannot imagine any intelligent person calling this a love story. The main character is over-sexed and super-needy. Why don't we all write about the relationships of the mentally ill and call it love. That is what this book does.
2,Not my Cup of Tea,"Unlike some reviewers in this forum, I have finished ""Love in the Time of Cholera"". I GET what Marquez is trying to do here but the book held little interest and value to me.There is almost no dialogue, the characters are as undeveloped as can be, and much of it is flat out implausible.I look at any book I read at the end and I ask myself this question : ""Was it worth the time invested?"". In this case, absolutely not."
1,Worst book EVER,"As others who rated this as a one star, I had the hardest time getting through this book. I love reading, and I had to force myself to pick this book up and finish it. I counted down to that final page and have never been so happy to be done with a book. It was slow and it really didn't come across as a great love story at all. I had no compassion for any of the characters. Don't waste your money. I'll give you mine for free."
5,Exquisite,"This book made an indelible impact on me. The varying themes and explorations of love were beyond me, above me, all over me... and that was what I enjoyed so much about it. The stunning poetic writing style had me highlighting different sections of the book. I even felt compelled to quote Márquez in my own book about love,50 Something Dates with 17 Mr. Wrongs: Lessons From A Dating RepositoryAnyone who appreciates literature and poetry should have this book at hand."
3,An Acquired Appreciation?,"This was my first read of Marquez. I found it riveting and enjoyed it, and yet I experienced it as a foreigner; i.e. I couldn't really identify with any of the characters even though I wanted to like them very much."
5,I love this book,I love this book and i read it in Portuguese and Arabic also and now i buy it in English so my girl friend can read it :)
4,Challenging but worth it,"This is not a simple beach read, despite its wonderful Caribbean setting. Instead it's a highly literary look at love inall its forms, and it is fantastic. Just don't take it for a rum-fueled escape :)"
1,Disappointment of epic proportions....,Purchased with high hopes of being able to add to my collection of fantastic reads; What a disappointment! This may be the only book in existence where the movie is actually better than the book....
5,Great Literature!,"Truly great literature. Brilliant work by a brilliant author. The book has wonderful narrative and storyline.Rose PresseyAuthor of ""My Haunted Family"""
1,Find something else to read.,"For some reason this book tries very hard to get its audience to be sympathetic to a man who falls in love or so he thinks with a girl he doesn't know. Trying to be faithful to the ""Love of his life"" he sleeps with every one in his town from widows to 14 year old girls when he is past fifty. Not the type of person I am usually sympathetic for. The main character doesn't have any redeeming qualities except poetic writing but even that is over the top. How can you write thousands of pages of love to a girl you know nothing about except for her name? This book is so unrealistic, the characters are not interesting and the plot keeps getting sided track to events that have no real importance at all. The only likable character (and I say that lightly) dies from a pathetic tragedy that seems at first to be relevant to the plot even if it is unlikely but no that too was just more wasted words. If this is what I can expect from Oprah's list I will steer clear."
1,So Oprah had it in her book club. Big deal. It still stinks.,"This book requires NO thinking. It's disturbing and puerile and reads like poorly written, voyeuristic porn. If this is what is deemed worthy of the Nobel Prize for Literature (albeit in 1982), then we are witnessing the downfall of human culture and enlightenment. Yuck."
2,Help! L e t s n o t f a l l a s l ee ee p !!!,"I agree with other who gave this a one star. The story.... eh---- I vacilate between seeing the hero as a dirty old, gieser, and a hopeless romantic. I really had to push myself to get through it."
4,Depressingly beautiful...,"This novel both condemned and redeemed itself in the main characters, namely Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza. Although extremely sad, the story as a whole truly makes one think: Does love like this exist? How many people have wasted away their lives with the wrong person in order to be ""safe""?Although more dialogue would have made it an easier read, the author's beautiful and flowing descriptions kept me interested. I feel that this book is both a wake-up call/reality check and a wonderful concept for the hopeless romantic."
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this book. The method of storytelling, while unusual and somewhat poetic, is rambling and almost painful to stay with. I did manage to finish it, but only because I forced myself to read to the end, not because I enjoyed it. The author slips key parts of the story into rambling text, to the point where I had to go back and reread a sentence or even a paragraph to verify that I had read it right. (Did he just say that? Did that really just happen? In the middle of a nothing paragraph?) Things don't need to be pointed out to me, but I find this style of writing very anti-climactic. I won't spoil the end, but I will say the entire book was just depressing and disappointing."
2,Should have been a short story,"When a brilliant writer has little to say and gets paid by the word, this is the kind of book that results. I always finish the books I start. I usually read them straight through. With this book I read three other books before finishing this one. The story is short and trite. It could be told very elegantly in 10,000 words. The rest is very well-written filler. As well-written as it is, filler is still filler and makes the reader work too hard to remain interested. I ended up not caring about either character (as they were not that interesting). I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did. I will check out some of his shorter titles. He writes brilliantly, so it may be worthwhile to read something of his where he has a story worth telling."
2,Slow ....slow,"A friend insisted that I read her copy of this book. I have honestly tried to enjoy it even half as much as apparently she did but.....slow is an understatement. Also, the lack of chapters and sometimes even paragraphs made it even harder to read.....harder to come back to ...etc. I finally scanned the last 100 pages and considered it a victory that it was finished."
1,Z-z-z-z,"Whenever I read a bad, boring book, I always check to see if I'm the only one with that opinion. I'm glad to confirm my opinion is shared by others. Aside from the bad plot and uninteresting characters, there was, possibly, five total pages of dialogue in the entire book. I have noticed this in other Central/South American authors' books. Too many ""words"", not enough ""talk""."
1,"A deeply disturbing plot, the worst book I've ever read","Maybe some people can argue about the literary value of this book, but there's the bottom line, a self-deceiving lunatic/rapist/child molester does not invoke the slightest sympathy. To sleep with a minor is wrong, period, no matter under what circumstances! To sleep with countless women without protection is also deeply disturbing. All is disguised under the name of "" unrequited love"", but really after finishing the book I still couldn't possibly believe what happenend between Florentino Ariza and Fermina was love. It was a naive childhood crush that never fruit to love. I question the dwindling morals of the society after leaning how many people have highly rated the book. Least to say it is the most disturbing and uncomfortable book I have ever put my hands on."
2,disappointed,"Thought this would be great, probably because of the hype and because I had heard that his other book was terrific. Coulnd't get past 7 pages of boredom. Passed the book on and was told the same thing by someone who also passed it on with the same result."
1,Eh...,"Well, I usually enjoy just about every genre when it comes to reading, and I tear through books once they seem even vaguely interesting...but I had a tough time even making it past the first two chapters. In fact I hardly did. Things seem to me, to be described in a roundabout way and quite honestly, it was mind numbing. I just couldn't bring myself to read any further. Don't waste your time or money. I even brought this on a 3 hour road trip with and I was extremely disapointed that I hadn't thought to bring something else."
5,A wonderful story,"The book is a bit repetitive in places but it is a delightful read. It spans two entire lifetimes. It takes place between the end of the 19th Century and ends in the beginning of the 20th Century. Like all Marquez novels, this one is well written and a joy to read.Marquez's use of fantasy realism is legendary and keeps the somewhat morose plot fun and moving. The main character stalks his lover in parks pretending to read on a bench as she passes by. His love becomes an obsession.Marquez shows that love and the sadness it can bring is not for youth alone. It celebrates the powerful hold that true love can have on a man his entire life. This is a book that a man would enjoy as much as a woman.Highly recommended."
1,Would you consider Hannibal Lector a romantic figure?,"If not, then you shouldn't consider Florentino Ariza one either. This is a startlingly good piece of literature, but, pedophilia is never justifiable--not even by Oprah! Shame on her! Ariza RAPES his ward--seduction in his mind, but it ultimately destroys her soul. So just like all the pedophiles and child murderers, he justifies his actions as love. Borrow the book from the library & read it--don't pay for a new copy wherein a pedophile is touted as a romantic hero. He is a complex character--both good and bad. But for our society to make someone with this much evil in him into a romantic hero dilutes both the original story and its value and allows pedophiles to justify their behavior."
5,Classic read,I've had the pleasure to read the original Spanish version of this book and it read like a poem. It reminded me when I read The Illiad. I bought the English version for my girlfriend to read this classic love poem. She is enjoying every sentence thus far.
3,hard to get into,"While well-written, I just wanted to tell the lead character to grow up and get over it. It wasn't a love story to me, but a teenage fantasy, with some disturbing twists along the way. Not my style."
4,Took me a while to love it,"What Gabriel Garcia Marquez does best, where most fail, is he lets his readers think. I had forgotten how to do that after reading years-worth of feed-it-to-me novels. As a result, I spent the first half of this book hating it. Yes, I am one of those folks that don't give up on a book just because I don't enjoy the first 99% of it, regardless of how long it takes me to finally get through it. I read on steadily with faith that it will eventually impress, and although I am sadly disappointed when this doesn't happen, Love in the Time of Cholera was THE ONE, the one that did finally capture me. Gabriel Garcia Marquez continues to hold a spot on my list of favorites."
2,Love in the time of Cholera,I did not like this book. I found it boring and almost porographic in places.
1,I can't get INTO it.,This is one book i can't get past the first chapter... it's just not interesting to me. I'll pass on it. I wasted good money and no more Oprah bookclub for me!
3,Love In The Time of Cholera,"'Love in the Time of Cholera' is one of the most unique books I've ever read. It's not quite what I expected. When I first started reading, I was expecting a love story and the start was a bit 'off' for me. But then I kept on reading. After about 50 pages, the love story began.I'm kind of torn in my review here, the love story is good, but the oddities were a bit much. I found I kept on reading just to see how the story ended more out of curiosity than anything else.One thing I really liked what that Gabriel García Márquez writes the story like poetry at some parts. It was beautiful to read some passages."
4,A meandering tour de force of romatic writing.,"This work serves as an example of fine literary craftsmanship,delivering a startling message:if you do not detect resonances from the text within your own life experience,you may not yet have embraced enough of what exists to fully appreciate what it means to have lived."
1,Don't bother!,"I have to say, I think Oprah and I have very different literary tastes. However, I have not read many of her selections, either.I found Love in the Time of Cholera to be quite tedious to read. I did not care for the main character, Florentino Ariza at all and felt him to be a disgusting person. However, I stuck with it and continued, very painfully, to read this book to the end. I was hoping that as a selection of Oprah's Book Club, that it might, in the end, have some redeeming qualities. There were none. It ended just as poorly as it begun, and wasn't pleasant at all along the way."
2,Slow Hard to get into,I had trouble reading this book. I love to read but for some reason the first thirty pages did not grab me. I will try to finish but I think it should be known that the book is slow and very detailed so it is a long read.
2,UGH !!!!!,"I think that this book had a few redeeming moments, as with the landscape descriptions but mostly it just droned on and on and on. I couldn't wait for it to finally end and be out out of my misery. Floretino Ariza made me uncomfortable, he was a stalker and had several mental health issues.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Very Slow Read,This book came highly recommended and to say the least I was disappointed. It took forever to read and I almost gave up on it. I really only enjoyed the last 50 or so pages.
3,Not much to say.,"Though a classic, this certainly wasn't a favorite of mine. I love the way Gabriel García Márquez writes and the way this book reads, but I wasn't a huge fan of the story itself. It was difficult for me to feel much sympathy for Florentino's character when he was such a gross player. And it was also difficult for me to feel much sympathy for Fermina, when she so selfishly rejected love and turned her back on Florentino.Overall, I think Gabriel García Márquez is an amazing, gifted writer.. I just wasn't thrilled with the story itself."
2,Interesting View of Love,"García Márquez has an interesting view of love -- to me much more like obsession. An intricate tale of two lives that intertwine for a time, go their own ways, and come together again. You almost like the characters, despite their flaws, but I never quite reached that point.García Márquez tells stories, and gives them a rich tapestry to make you feel you understand -- and he did it again. I, however, prefer to like the characters as much as I like to feel I understand them. Not my favorite of his works."
3,Not a love story,"My book club selected this book thinking it was a love story and thinking that it would be a good read since it was made into a movie, but we were wrong on both assertions. I think I may have been the only one to finish it. Just as The Great Gatsby and just as Romeo and Juliet are not love stories, if you look closely beneath the prose and under what Marquez writes about Florentino, the crazed lover, you will find that this is not a love story either, but a question of the importance of stability in life. I'm not sure if this was what Marquez was getting at but who we side with, may tell us a lot about us but it will not make us swoon and wish we had a lover as crazy as Fermina Daza's."
4,he carves the walls of the heart,"I admire GGM's patience for love both in love in the time of cholera and hundred years of solitude. he is alive when he talks of the waiting years. he thrives in the longing, he carves and carves the walls of a waiting heart and nourishes the memories. that's what makes it breathtaking. the suspense is carefully and patiently savored, its juice came ever so sweetly.excellent,too are his brilliant thoughts on ordinary ircumstances. there were things one would not thnk of verbalizing but there they were blinding you with the simple fear or discomfort of truth.there is however a part that left me rather lost, maybe out of misinterpretation. there is a portion in the book i found unresolved. I believe, in a book, all holes must be covered."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"The book had a lot of potential and got off to an interesting start. It began as a sweet but strange love story, hit a number of slow spots, and then deteriorated into pointless perversion. While there were some endearing and poignant moments, the debauchery that the story became completely ruined this book for me. After the main character loses his chance at his ""one true love"" he debases himself by sleeping with hundreds of random women, ultimately to become an elderly, incestuous, child rapist. Although the author allegedly uses the novel to describe the many types of love, there is not much love but instead lust, rape, seduction, adultery, molestation, depression, and delusion. I wish I had my four days of reading back. Really not worth your time."
3,Strangely wonderous,"This book took me months to read; there is so much of the story on each page that you can only take in a bit at a time. To be honest, some of the sexual descriptions were fairly twisted, but that is all part of the crazy and enchanting world that he has created. I won't ever read it again, but I'm glad I read it once."
2,Takes itself too seriously and too slow to read,"I admit I never finished this book. After I didn't enjoy the beginning, I made myself read 50 more pages. I still didn't enjoy it, so I quit. The reviews say it is the greatest love story of all time, so I was expecting this exciting love story. For the part I read, it was very slow moving and took itself much too seriously. A big disappointment."
5,the best book ever,"sorry for the late review. the book is fantastic, I love it so much! And also in a good condition."
3,Hard to Rate,"Though overall I liked this book, it wasn't one that I found hard to put down. I guess I'm one of those people who just don't get it. I like a serious page turner and this wasn't the kind of book that did that for me."
1,Thank Goodness I'm Not the Only One,"I found this book, like others to be unbelievably dull and unrealistic. ""Love"" is not the word I'd use to describe any of the relationships created. I was more interested in reading about the cholera and the civil war. I couldn't understand many of the relationships and I found it horrific that rape could be glorified.It saves me the time of reading One Hundred Years of Solitude. I have no interest."
1,Disturbing to Say the Least,"Like many other people, I too had heard that this was a fantastic book. I was actually excited about reading it. It took me about 2 months, just because I had to force myself to pick it up every once in a while. The subject matter was boring....yes, Florentino loves Fermina, but why? Why does he obsess over her for 50-something years? Move on already! That isn't love, that is scary obsession.Just when you are about to fall asleep, you come across disturbing images, such as Florentino soiling himself in the back of a carriage, molesting a 14 year old child put in his care, having NUMEROUS flings with prostitutes, when he claims to love Fermina....the list goes on. I understand that this takes place in a different time and the author attempts to give us a glimpse into what life was like back then, but I don't want to read about a poverty-stricken society living with sewage running through the streets. You see enough of that on TV. My suggestion....don't waste your money."
5,amazing,THis is the best book I've ever read. The style in which it's written totally envelopes you and makes you understand love without him actually saying what it is or how you're supposed to feel when you're in love. Just what it is.
2,slow and sad-long-love?,"It started great, I love Fermina's marriage and husband! that was fun and wonderful and also, a realistic love. But the Florentino? sick, a bit disturbing long love - The author tried to put passion and a strong love, I don't know about that."
5,Wonderful!,"The narrative is moving and powerful, the characters are realistic and evocative. I would suggest this book to anyone as a must-read."
3,Disappointed,"From the outside the book looked as advertised, ""as new"". But once it was openend it looked like it baked in the sun for days. Every page was very yellow and dark around the edges making it hard to read. Appreciated that the vendor offers to replace it if you are not happy but who wants the hassle of that? Besides, I needed to start reading it right away for my book club."
1,Wordy,"Incredibly boring and wordy. I didn't like or empathasize with any of the characters. This book simple confirmed to me, once again, that people have no idea what love truly is."
1,Horrible,"I heard this book was great and given the recent movie, I figured I would read it. I also heard the first 50-100 pages were very slow. So I plowed through hoping it would pick up. What a waste of time...the book constantly put me to sleep and every 50 or so pages not much movement was made in the story. I lost the book after having read 225 pages and trust me, I am not actively searching to find it so I can finish it. I think I am more grateful at having lost the book so I have an excuse not to finish it. So incredibly slow, the translation itself made it difficult to read, and the story was weak. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Misprinted book,At page 180 the book could not be read. The pages were put together allout of order. This has never happened to me with any book that I haveever purchased. Amazon offered to send another book. I had lostinterest in the book so they gave me a $5.00 credit towards my nextpurchase.
1,Sad and strange.,"I so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book. I read it recently for a book club selection, and let me tell you, If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the first twenty pages, and never picked it up again. I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree. I am giving it one star only for the rich use of language."
1,Wanted to Love It,"I really struggled with this one. I thought the writing was decent, but had trouble liking, identifying with or caring about any of the characters. Not something that is necessary, but when the plot moves so slow you start grasping for something to motivate you to finish. Did not leave me wanting more or thinking about it after except to wonder what all the hype is about."
4,What is the defintion of love?,"One may have to be a fan to truly enjoy this book, or one may just hav to be old enough to remember all the things love can be. A loveless marriage that is truly based in love is hard for most to understand, and the flavor of another culture can be disarming, even deceptive at times. All in all, I have been a fan and had a relationship of my own for 46 years so the poignancy of the flash back, though a different tie period than my own, still reaches in to touch a special memory.E. Claverie, editor, ""Forget the Cures, Find the Cause, Books I and II"""
1,I wish I can give it a half star...,"It has been almost a month now and I couldn't finish the book. No, I am not a slow reader. I only have a 100 pages to go and I am still waiting for something that would perk up my interest. In fairness, the description of the places are really vivid. That is just about it. Do not waste your time and money."
1,Love conquers all . . . including pedophilia?,"I'm rather shocked by the fanfare for this novel. The sexual escapades were nauseating, and I vomited in my mouth a little when I read about the pedophilia, which Marquez excuses with a shrug of the shoulders and a wave of the hand. And while the idea of unrequited love can be noble, and the thought of seniors feeling giddy again is sweet, there was nothing of nobility, and little sweetness in this book. Love conquers all? Hardly. Fermina Daza was correct the majority of her life; stay away from Florentino Ariza. Don't waste your precious time and degrade your sense of morality in the process."
1,Disappointing,"Reviewers said it was ""magical,"" extolling the plot and the author. I found it disappointing, after an interesting beginning. Now I just want it to be over and I have 100 pages to go. Seems like 1000.I was afraid I was one of the few who didn't love this book. I'm happy to find some readers agreeing with me.I'm a reader and love books. I told a friend who teaches college English that I thought it was ""tedious and dense."" I wondered if I got a bad translation!"
5,Beautiful book still,"I received this book recently as a gift. I had actually read it many years back - 87/88 - and always knew that I loved it, but couldn't really remember why. I feel like reading this as an adult was a little like seeing ET again as an adult. There was a newness and wonderment from experiencing it again from a totally different vantage point. I have so much more life experience and can relate so much better to the characters. The foolish idealism of young love, the novelty of new lovers, the safety of old lovers, the pragmatism of marital love. I hadn't experience any of these things as a wet behind the ears high school student. I recommend this to anyone as a worthy book to read again and relish."
3,"First half is worthy, second half is irrelevant","Very rich first chapter, detailed, engaging. First half of the book tells a worthy story of exuberant, young romantic love and the reprisal from aristocratic society. Well done. The second half prosaicly details a series of affairs and stultified chronologies of other trivia until the final ending, when of course, the lovers are reunited. The quality of the literature deteriorates until the perfunctory melodramatic ending.This is not great literature."
3,Love in the time of cholera,Couldn't really get into the book. Beginning is too dense and full of details for my tastes.
3,Cool,"This ring is really cool, but a little while after I got it, the inside flame thing popped out. It was alright and I just glued it back in, but the ring is kind of cheap. Not high quality,but alright."
3,golf for the kids,"We took advantage of Amazon[.com]'s/Toys R Us' ""buy one get one free"" deal on board games, and picked this up for our 3 year old son. He was freaking out once we began to put it together and realized that we forgot to get the batteries, so I had to rush down to the drugstore on an emergency Duracell run. Anyway, I got back and we finished hooking up the pieces.My son loves this game, but I have one complaint: the thing just won't stay hooked together. I have popped the pieces of the ""golf green"" together so many times it has become a routine. This can be frustrating to both child and (especially) parent, so you may want to consider this when making a decision on buying this game.""Silly Six Pins"" is a bowling game made by the same company (Hasbro) and it is high-quality and fun. I would recommend it over the golf game."
2,DONT BUY IT,"My sons 2 and 4 played with this toy for about 10 minutes after setting it up. We all hated the way it fell apart when moved,and the balls didnt always go where they were supposed to. When in storage, you need to take out the batteries for the thing to shut up, otherwise you hear it in the closet in the middle of the night. My husband said he turned the switch off, but it was faulty. The boys had more fun hitting each other with the clubs, than trying to sink the balls. My recommendation....dont buy it. Ours found a permanent placement in the garbage."
4,Part II of Frustrating Golf,"I like this toy much better now that I have used 3/4 of a tube of construction adhesive on the underside! I propped and glued the three piece ramp together and secured it with electrical tape to be sure it wouldn't shift while drying. Then I attached the ramp to the gopher part and flipped & glued the heck out of that too! It is not coming apart for anything. I do warn---before you do this--make sure you have room to store it when it is together. I have a toy room/closet, but it fits under a bed too:) The other warning is--make sure your child is not around when you begin gluing. My two year old wanted to sit next to it and wait for it to dry! Now---if I can only shut those gophers up..."
3,rough putting,"This game should be a huge hit. My two sons, ages three and six, love golf and are always 'practicing'. They wanted this for Christmas and were thrilled when it was under the tree. Unfortunately, the excitement ended there as the green does not stay together - it didn't the first day and it has not improved. We are all frustrated with the construction and find playing 'silly' golf impossible."
1,$2 rip-off,"this so called movie should be an embarrassment to AMAZON. SHAME on you for even offering this. the ""movie"" is a collection of pictures with scrolled statements across the bottom of the screen that any two year old could surmise. if amazon had any character they would offer a credit to anyone like me foolish enough to have fallen for this ""dung""!!."
3,Burns my feet,"I am using the Softheat to warm my feet,but it is too hot even on the lowest setting.A thermometer placed between the pad and my feetshows about 100 degrees F, sometimes as high as 102,which is too hot. I tried to separate the pad frommy feet by a blanket, but no use - after sometime the heat penetrates it and my feet burn to ashes.I had 2 Softheat pads over the years and bothhad the same problem, so it is a design flaw, not a defective unit."
5,heating pads,Finally found heating pads that do not turn off automatically. I had to have these for my senior 4 legged loved ones are older and arthritic. These are great.
5,Husband digs it!,He works a labor intensive job and just wants to come home to his comfy bed and a hot patch on his back. This works great for him! More cost effective than a Bengay or Tylenol stick on.
1,Stopped working after 6 mos.,"It stopped working, the switch light is on, but the pad is cold...lame.Also, even when it did work, the switch part would get really hot. Scary!Sure it shuts off after 20 mins., nice auto off feature, but I was afraid it would burst into flames;pLame."
1,heating pad,works fine but not what i wanted....they advertize as a soft heating pad...there is nothing soft about it....it's like a hard piece of cardboard with some cloth around it.
1,Disappointing,Disappointing - bought at local Target store for $13.99 yesterday. Highest heat setting is barely warm and also found it to be too rigid to target specific area (neck/shoulder in my case).
2,disappointing heating pad,"I just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one I had for years. I read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices, price being the primary concern. The saying you get what you paid for is true !! The heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap. Pay more and be happier."
1,Disappointed,I am disappointed because the tag lied. They do automatically shut off. I bought these because the tag said that they do not automatically shut off. Liar liar liar
5,Great for work or reading at home,"I love this product. I use it regularly at work, since they insist on freezing us year around. Works great."
2,Product now has automatic shutoff,"I bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they don't have automatic shutoff, but now they do. I guess this is considered an improvement, but I bought them for an elderly cat, and she can't reset the control every hour. They are a good value if you don't mind the auto shutoff."
1,Fire Hazard,"I bought a 12X15 inch Kaz SoftHeat unit in December 2007. On 12/07/2008 the electrical cord unexpectedly broke at the junction of the cord and the blue stress reliever near the control unit, shorted out, and started sparking. Fortunately, I wasn't shocked or burned. The unit saw almost daily use for a back condition but has not been abused. I've contacted Kaz to request a refund. Frankly, I think that the construction of their SoftHeat products is shoddy and unsafe and I won't buy another one of their heating pads."
1,This is not a heating pad!!!,I followed the other reviews that said that this heating pad got hot enough!!!What a joke! This is not a heating pad! It doesn't even get warm! I wasted my money!So please don't waste yours!!!
2,Trying to find Work from Home Jobs-Don't Use this Book,"My best friend bought this book for me in hopes that I could find a work from home job, as I am totally disabled and cannotwork outside my home. I went thru each page carefully, sent emails to companies that only had emails, never receiving one single response, I visited websites that were listed and found that they no longer existed or were for sale and then I sent viaUS Mail letters of interest to companies that only had street addresses listed, and every one of them (15 in all) came back tome 'address unknown'. If you really, seriously need to find a job or a business to work from home, this is NOT the book for you."
1,take caution,i just bought this book now iam sending it back i didnt buy it from amazon first the part to start your own businness are way to munch money from $200 too 90.000 some dont sound good either then i went to the local state to found a job in my area their was none this is in the book in the back part but their were many in other states i then went to the sales part and tryied a company called pro card they give you leads to call on people to see if they want dental insurace guess what the leads were very old and you have to be a member $15 a month i try to get that back but they never gave me a refund untill icalled the better bussiness burue watch out
1,Oh No!!,"I was totally disappointed by this album. It lacked quality and vocal variety. The music was predictable and there wasn't a ""voice blend"". I was shocked because John usually does such fine work. God Speed anyway."
4,One of the original tec's!,"Had all previous movies which were most entertaining so when i noticed ""returns"" had to jump on that! Ralph byrd was really suited for the job as tracy!"
2,easily the worst of the bunch,I was looking forward to receiving this DVD as I had all the other Dick Tracy serials. was i disappointed!! The storyline dragged almost from the beginning. I actually fell asleep TWICE trying to watch it. I feel that it is easily the worst of the series (even worse that Crime Inc.)I would stick to the first (Dick Tracy VS the Lame one...the best of the four).
4,Feature-length edition,"Unlike the other versions of this video, this one is a condensed feature-length 100 rather than 260 minutes; it was carefully edited from the original 15 serial episodes with the integrity preserved as well as most of the ""non-stop action"" these serials and others by Witney and English were famous for. It starred Lynn Roberts, Charles Middleton, Jerry Tucker, David Sharpe and Ned Glass, was directed by William Witney and John English, and was photographed by William Nobles."
1,"dull, repetitive, tedious and of minimal educational value","This is the fourth semester I have been forced to teach from this book, and I dislike it more each time I use it. The entire Oral Comm series is mediocre at best, but level three is far and away the worst of them all. I hope they don't come out with new editions; that's the best chance I have of getting our school to switch to a different series soon."
3,hmm..,"They said it is just like a new one, but it is not.But the condition is nice and price is reasonable."
4,One of the better preludes...,"I liked Brothers Majere. It is, however, essentially a crime novel set in the DL world. I thought this added rather than detracted to the effect though.I would rate Kevin Stein among the great Dragonlance authors, although I was surprised to learn this is the only one he's written. Surely he deserves more writing assignments than some other DL authors I could name.Brother Majere is one of the much better Preludes, leaving Darkness and Light far behind. It is a must to any Raistlin fan, and though it occasionally differs from Brothers in Arms, the differences are not too important and don't impact too much on the story.Read this book."
2,Pretty poor,"It's pretty hard to make a bad novel about Raistlin Majere... one of the most compelling fantasy characters ever created, but this novel really takes the cake. It's just not good. Does anyone care about missing cats? Thank goodness the 'Cat Lord' comes to help. Caramon is irritatingly portrayed as the stock simpleton, and Raistlin can't decide whether to love him or treat him awfully. You receive no new insights into either character, and like the other two preludes that come before it this should never have been allowed to be included in the Dragonlance Saga. It cheapens every other book in the series. Unless you're a hardcore DL collector pass this one bye because you won't be missing a thing."
1,A poor addition to the world of Dragonlance.,"Brothers Majere starts off well and offers a new and never-before-seen adventure the likes of which I have never seen. However, it quickly degenerates into The Classic Dragonlance Plot, but without the epic feel Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman incorporate in their novels. The author also made two gigantic mistakes which contradict lines located in Tales of the Lance and Dragons of Autumn Twilight. The Soulforge and Brothers in Arms are much better than Brothers Majere."
4,pretty good,"this book was pretty good, nothing really special about it. If you are a dragonlance fan like I am, you need to at least read it."
3,One of the better Dragonlance: Preludes,I know a lot people really didn't greatly care for it but I thought it was really good and truly enjoyed it. It's just one of thoughs that you'll just have to read and decided for your self.
5,Exceptional How-to,"I've used this book to help me in several wiring jobs as we remodel our home. I've never done any wiring befor, but with this book all my projects (from ceiling fans to completly rewiring a new addition to the house) have come out right the first time. The book is full of easy to follow illustrations and is written in clear easy steps. I borrowed 5 books on wiring from a friend when I started working, and kept coming back to this one as it is most complete and easiest to follow. I highly recomend it to anyone in need of a helping hand while doing home wiring."
3,Overpriced,"I found this at three price points on Amazon; $13, $28, and $40 plus another $6 shipping.The zipper bag is well made and has plenty of places for the various tools. The bag alone is available for $13 plus $6 shipping. At $19, it's handy but still over priced.I received the $28 version plus $6 shipping.I wish I'd just gotten the $19 zipper bag without the tools. The flashlight and wirecutters were worthless and I immediately replaced them. There is also a $40 dollar version that includes a maglite and a small stainless fret ruler.I my opinion, you should just get the bag and not waste your money on the ones that include tools. I received it as a gift. It's one of those things I'm glad I have but I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. I value the zipper bag at $10."
3,"Very good astronomy introduction, but now out of date.","We used this book for many years in our college introductory astronomy laboratories. Provides an an excellent introduction to astronomical observing. Well illustrated and includes star maps and positions of objects. However, the book needs updating. The positions are given in 1950 coordinates, planetary positions are listed only for years near the publication date, and no mention is made of Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes that are now popular with amateurs."
3,"Decent Book.. Not ""new"" though","The content of the book is great.. However, keep in mind it's from the 50's and this book I received was printed in the 80's..Super small in physical size, and it looked worn out and had some scratches."
5,"Old, but still invaluable for the amateur astronomer!","I bought my first edition back in the late 1970's. I bought this copy for my nephew. This book covers the basics of optics, teaching you how to calculate magnificaton with your objective's focal length, and the eyepiece focal length; it covers the basics of planetary, and interstellar objects; it covers safe, solar observation techniques; it gives a basic overview of astrophotography (film based, but film offers advantages over CCD's -- many techniqes apply to both approaches anyway); it even includes some star charts to get the amateur started.For the basics of amateur astronomy, this book cannot be beat. I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. Cheers!"
5,Great Way To Spend An Evening,"Asian Gay man who has written his family about getting married to hide his homosexuality has to arrange a fake marriage when his family surprises him and says they will attend. Very funny, good story line and great acting. A good chick flick when the GF makes you watch a movie with her. Unless you are a homophobe you will get a good feeling from this film. Recommended"
5,A Fantastic Film About Family,"This film proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a family can take many forms. The cast is brilliant, the storyline is phenomenal. You'll laugh and you'll cry, and it will stick with you for a long time."
5,Great for those with an asian background.,"This is a great movie about the merge of two cultures. It's about two men, who are partners in life. On of those men is chinese. Because of his mother's constant match-making and his father's need to have a baby, the protangonist is forced to marry. This movies tells about the ups and downs that many asians parents (like mines) have problems when dealing with having a ""happy"" child. I greatly recommend for those people who want to understand the mix of cultures."
5,The mirror of every gay in the closet...excelent movie!,"Funny,Dramatic,a nice love story, a perfect coming out gift for Gay's parents. An aproach to the Chinese Family Traditions in the modern world."
3,Good comedy succeeds without trashing gay or Chinese culture,"This is a cute movie, full of chuckles. The lead actors in the movie, Winston Chao and some White guy, are awful. Fortunately the direction and surrounding cast are good. A solid script somehow manages to navigate the intersection of traditional-normative Chinese culture and normative American gay-male culture without grossly insulting either. The film never really explores the two cultures or takes high risks, but hey--it's a comedy, and this one is good for some laughs."
4,Triumph Over Evil,"This was a story of triumph of a young chinese girl, Adeline Yen Mah, swallowed whole by the fate that left her with the cruelest face of humankind...her stepmother, Niang Yen. As a rose cannot grow without sun, light, and earth, nor could this girl have survived life w/out the endearing love from her Aunt Baba who encouraged and nurtured her despite inflictions from the Adeline's stepmother and father in doing so.After reading this book I feel compelled to hug Adeline Yan Mah and tell her what a wonderful person she is."
3,An autobiography of far too much self-pity.,"It is quite intersting and compelling. It did a pretty nice job in terms of leading the readers through the chaotic era of China. Yet, I found that Mah was filled with anger and frustration that were a bit blown out of proportion. During such period of time in China,a girl able to study abroad and got a medical degree, was no doubt a rare occurance. But she seemed to look at the negative sides of everything. Instead of really treasuring such opportunities, she was continously blaming others, Niang, her first husband,etc for her ""unfortunate fate."" However,I am sure there were people suffering much more than she was in China, both in the past and the present. I was reading the book to fill up some really boring days.If readers are interested in such kind of real life autobiography and history related novel of Chinese, I'd stronly recommend ""Life and Death in Shanghai"" which I found much more impactful. It was the book that I really couldn't put down."
2,"Much to talk about, but not very well told","I found this book disappointing because she is cheated so many times out of family acceptance. She fails to see that Niang's opinion of her can never be changed because she believes too strongly in the wholesome ""Leave it to Beaver"" family attitude. Her memory lacks real emotional substance, she doesn't really say anything other than the plain facts during these tragic events of her childhood. At the end when Aunt BaBa died, I couldn't relate to Adeline's warm, peaceful feeling, so I don't think the ending settled any matters between her and her family. Her writing style is good, but I didn't understand how so much boring history related to her story. She skips around on the timeline, which confused me while I tried to organize each event in my mind."
4,Falling Leaves,"The book truly gives reader the background of how people lived back in the old Shanghai days. Even now, people back in Shanghai still admire the west. They even look down on their fellow chinese and still think people from the west are from highest class. It's still a pity that nothing had changed their values. Adaleine to me has her own selfish ways that even she succeeded with her career, what she so called ""successful marriage"", it's her childhood that I pitied but the hatred and her unforgiveness still inside her heart even to her sibling truly not worth young readers to regard her as model."
3,Love = inheritance,"I can't help thinking that the author measured her parents' love and affection based on the amount of her inheritance. Otherwise, the story is interesting."
3,Really poignant but also...,"I finished Adeline Yen Mah's novel in only two days and then read it once again. I affected me deeply the first time I read it and I considered it a great novel but the second time I thought that Mah was quite biased about her life and I, to put it honestly, do not think that she was treated so unfairly among her other siblings. When she explains how she got the chance to go to England by coming first in a competition, she doesn't sound convincing and her remarks sound like a total make-up, I believe her father would have sent her to England even if she didn't achieve such a success. Mah seems to overstate too much about her stepmother and wants the reader that she was the only one who went through so many difficulties. The question is, was life only so hard on Adeline? How about her brothers and sisters?"
5,I take my universal hat off to Mah,"This lady is truly inspiring. To make of her life what she has from the cards dealt her in childhood is truly amazing. Mah kept me captivated from start to finish. Her literary style is enchanting, she knows how to capture an audience. Without going into the book any further, although I would like to say, it will appeal to all, this book should be compulsory reading for those with the belief that life is too tough. For those that give up too easily, for those that blame everyone else for their own ills, for those that blame government, society, etc... This book will change your outlook. It changed mine. If it doesn't, you have a problem."
3,Interesting account and great history lesson,"I agree with some other readers that the story, while tragic to the author is relative to all of our own family tragedies, however I felt compelled to read on due to the interwoven history lesson. A very fast read and worthwhile."
3,"Interesting, but a one-sided story","This book is well-written and captivating. The descriptions of turmoil in China seen thru the eyes of a child are interesting. All children are self-centered and feel neglected to some extent, but she makes a strong Cinderella case. However, we read just one side of the story. As she reaches adulthood, we see many signs that ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree"": she dumps the university researcher and first husband when their usefulness is spent, buys a new Mercedes on impulse, fights with siblings over the estate, etc. The abused become the abusers."
1,Did I really read the whole thing????,"This book was so boring. It lacked detail and emotion. Furthermore, it was not about an unwanted Chinese daughter. This book was about a complete family being mistreated by a stepmother with mental problems and a spineless father. I lost respect for everyone in the family that kept in contact with Niang AND their father after the way they were treated. Horrible waste of my time - Why did I keep reading it? I guess I thought it would amount to more by the time I was finished. I was wrong."
1,Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah,"I agree with the other person that gave this book a bad review. How can someone feel so sorry for themselves and then think that other people want to hear them whine and complain about it. I also thought that this book would be more insightful on Chinese culture, but instead it was someone telling a story about how bad they had it growing up, and they didn't even have it that bad. Read Red Azalea if you want to learn more about the cultural revolution in China from someone's perspective who was there."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"This was a poorly written sob story by a wealthy American doctor. She desperately desired her cruel parent's approval even with years of evidence that 1) they would never give it and 2) it would be worthless, since they themselves were worthless. They treated her and her siblings as donkeys, proffering and yanking away the carrots of affection and money. She blames all of this on the ""evil stepmother,"" but all complicit share the guilt. Her victim saga is sad, but she had ample examples of strength and independence to follow, which she mainly ignored. Her younger sister Susan and her Aunt Baba were the heros of the story, but the author sadly didn't follow their example. Basically, I should have been paid to read this, as it seems like a whinge to a therapist."
3,Based on a true story,"While I enjoyed the book. It seemed rather repetitious. I couldn't help wondering why the main character endured such abuse from her family for so long after she became an adult. I personally do not like reading about abusive families; however, this was a book club selection. It is worth reading to learn more about Chinese family dynamics."
5,Fascinating story!,The history in this book is so interesting to me. Chinese girls were for the most part unwanted and this books tells of the discrimination they face.
5,Intense and a story of amazing coursge,"The author brings you into the book and you get to experience the despair, the courage and hope. This at times was gut-wrenching but also a book that opened my eyes and taught me many life lessons."
3,Easy Reading,Much to learn about the Chinese culture in an easy to read style. Lisa See's fictional 'Shanghai Girls' is similar but better written.
4,Surprised at the quality,"Lately there seems to be an influx on Chinese attempting to write English novels, and judging by the quality of the majority of those works, my expectations were not high when I started reading this book.I was wrong though. Although Ms Mah is not native English, her command of the language is superb. Very lyrical and captivating writing. I could not put the book down.Behind the writing is a well-crafted plot. Though she cannot take the credit for inventing the story, she has written it in such a way that the many many complex layers of her family life have been presented to the best advantage. I like the addition of Chinese proverbs as the chapter titles and throughout the novel. Not only do they add a touch of authencity to her racial background, to a Chinese reader they also offer a deeper insight into the story."
5,Beautiful Story!,"This was one of the most touching stories I have ever read; it is beautifuly written and heartrenching, yet warms the spirit to hear of such a strong soul! I cried at the injustices Adeline suffered at the hands of her father and especially her step-mother. I was also moved to tears by the injustice endured by her family at the hands of the angry mobs in revolutionary China. I was overjoyed and excited for her in her triumphs. I came to feel love and care for this amazing young woman from China, a place so foriegn to me. I came to better understand what compels others to do things not in their own best intrests in order to gain the acceptance and affection of a loved one. I believe we should thank Ms. Adeline Yen Mah for her courage and strengh and her gift to us, that of sharing her amazing spirit with her readers. I encountered great difficulty putting this book down, and when not reading I found myself thinking of the story! A wonderful literary expierience for anyone!"
5,Emotional,"Falling Leaves is a book that I can recommend to any one I know. I allowed myself to feel the feelings Adeline was feeling and it brought up unpleasant memories of my own. Wonderfully written with beautiful Asian quotes. I am a white American with a huge interrest in Asian cultures, I find them so fascinating and this book reveales Chinese culture in an honest look through the eyes of a woman who lived a dreadful existance brought on by her own family. A remarkable story that takes you away to Adelines homeland and back through history. You will want to swoop this child up in your arms and rescue her from the hatred and neglect, but the pain she endures through life makes her the strong woman she is today. Falling Leaves is a journey...a great read!"
2,"Too ""bad""to be true",Some of the stories are so farfetched and implausible that makes the whole work lose credibility.
1,So what?,"I have a friend who was born in Algeria. Her father was murdered and her mother died of starvation, holding two babies in her arms. One of them was a girl (my friend) who eventually ended up in an orphanage in France. She never had the opportunity to go to University and become a doctor. She never had to fight a will, she never had to fight with her siblings over money... And she is the most generous person I know. MS. Adeline Yen Mah is very lucky; a lot of kids are left alone, abused, mistreated and never have the chance to become American citizens, study and have a wonderful life in California."
2,I don't like this book,"I don't feel that it is a good book for me. After finished my reading, I could only say that it is the reality of a society. I don't want to give my sympathy to anyone in this book, and even the author."
3,The Unwanted Daughter,I read this book because it was the choice of a book club to which I belong. The behavior of the family was so like mine that I felt right at home. It had a sad ending because our heroine wanted acceptance so badly. I found it depressing with little enlightenment for me. She should have found a new way of dealing with her emotions.
3,Real Life Cinderella story,"I really rated this book between a 2-3star. More 3 starThis book is a momoir of a Chineese girl who grew up in China and than in Hong Kong; How she was able to over come a terrible childhood at the hand of an evil stepmother. The story is very moving and I really felt her pain emensely. She grew up with the proverbal wicked stepmother. Her story was very moving and if rating her story alone I would give her a 4 star. The problem I had with the story was that it jumped around to much for my liking. One minute the story was being told about 1952 and the next it was 1969 and than back to 1947. All the skipping around was a little confusing and quite fustrating. But all in all I thought Adeline's story was amazing. She is definitely an amazing woman. This book is worth reading and is a real life Cinderella story.Unforunately this is really not my typical book to read. It is a book club read and I did enjoy it. If you enjoy memoirs, this book is a definite must read"
4,"Well-written, clear and complex, survival/struggle/transform","Well-written, clear, concise, human inspiration of struggle to make sense of deeply negative family setting. Think about - clarity of childhood perception of the family situation v/v the emotional need to be loved and accepted. Can/could be debilitating, yet for some, ie Yen Mah, she found perseverence in herself and ability to not just survive, but to finally find a loving husband and a satisfying and challenging career. A breath of fresh air in light of the ""blaming"" theme prevalent in much of our society at this time. Still incredulous to me how she could still seek/anticipate any acceptance or love from Niang in the last 1/3-1/4 of the book. Human nature? How do we tick? Another observation from her story: the power of gifts that come our way-Aunt Baba-whose deep love and support were critical to Yen Mah's self-perception."
5,"Dramatic, Emotional, Deep, and a Gut Wrenching Saga","I just completed this novel, and it was the first book I have ever read that gave me a feeling of soulfoul emotions. By the end of the book, you feel as if you are a close freind of the author, and right there in China. Each character has its own tableu of sounds and color that echo off into a saga filled with pain, triumph, and respect. The evil Niang, is the most ruthless I have ever read of to date. I found this book to be excellant even though others have not, but it was touching and a true gripping story!"
3,Interesting but not very in depth.,I found this book interesting but not very in depth. I do not truly understand why the characters act as they do nor did I particularly care about the characters. Why is the step mother so cruel? Why does the father allow it? Is money the only reason the brothers follow after the step mother? It leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I had a hard time caring about the author because she lacked emotion as well. She didn't really express how she felt about anyone-very surfacy.
4,Makes you want to cry. . .,"The story was an interesting read. Especially the history of China. It made me incredibly sad to know that in every time and place a child grows up in a loveless and abusive home.I found another reviewer's comments interesting in that they found this book ""drivel"" and wondered why it had been written or a bestseller at that. ""She didn't have it so bad"". Everyone has a story to be told and if it makes her whole, so be it. At least I could get through this book, which is more than I can say for ""Angela's Ashes"". Just because someone's story is not the worst, does not invalidate it."
3,I couldn't put it down!,"I could not put Falling Leaves down, yet I kept wondering what the other side of Adelines relationships were. Her story of being victomized by most members of her family, by her college professor/boyfriend in England, ex-husband, sisters and long lost nephews and neices made me a little suspicious that there is another side to her story, let alone her story of stepmother and father treatment of her. I know there is another side to this story. I also would like to know her own relationship with her own children. Besides these doubts of her one sided account,I found the history very interesting and I do admire her for her accomplishments!"
4,definitely worth reading,this book was more historical than i expected. the politics of china was woven throughout her story from a perspective one would never see or feel otherwise. her life remained hopeless throughout and it makes one see and appreciate just how wonderful the simple things of life in the united states really are. the style of writing is very matter-of-fact and you never feel she is whining or merely looking for sympathy. this is a very worthwhile book.
4,Must read,This was a great memoir. It left me feeling angry at how some people treat children or other people for that matter! I'm thankful to live in a society that recognizes the value of women. Once again it shows that human nature wants approval from parents in all circumstances. This is a heart wrenching story that had some redeeming moments but the are few & far between.The book is well written and believable. A must read.
5,Falling Leaves- FANTASTIC read!,"The heartbreaking story of an unwanted, abused, neglected child who never ceases to try and earn her family's affections. If you have ever experienced these feelings,no matter what your race, you will LOVE this book. It moved me to tears and I could not put it down once I started reading it."
5,good and sad,"this book is well written, and didn't take me too long to get through. mah retells her fascinating story, and includes descriptions of the events in China at that time (the Communist take-over). it is a sad story of family relations gone bad as she tries desperately for her family to come together."
1,Utter drivel.,"This book rates as THE worst that I have ever read and were it not for a belief in the sanctity of the written word I would take it outside and burn it. Not only is the quality of the writing extremely poor, the author gives the impression of being a bitter, immature, whinging, unbalanced and revenge seeking spoilt brat. Oh poor little unloved rich kid! How many times have we heard this theme - get over it!! This book is completely one-sided and fails to address any of the feelings of her family or the enormous advantages bestowed on the author compared to her fellow countrymen. It is with great sadness that I see this book in any way compared to the dignified, intelligent and balanced writing of Jung Chang in Wild Swans. Please do not buy this book and thus give the author any more satisfaction in her self-centered righteousness."
1,Over-rated and over-hyped,I read this book before it was re-released and I think it's a travesty and a pityfest that dies out after a few chapters. The title is basically an attention-grabbing effort to pull at the heart strings of home makers who need to fill lazy afternoons. Wouldn't have given it any stars if I had the choice.
3,"I wanted to hear ""the other side""","I enjoyed this book and was sorry for the children. However I found myself wanting to hear the stepmother's and father's point of view. I find these typed of books very unfair when the accused are not longer around to defend themselves. It smacks a little of ""poor little rich girl"". However it is worth reading."
5,A Fantastic Journey,"I finished reading Falling Leaves weeks ago, and the author's words still haunt me. My heart ached for the sufferings of Adeline as a little girl and yet hers is a story of hope and perseverance. (The book is also a good primer of 20th century Chinese history.) Kudos to the author for the strength it must have taken her to recall and ""re-live"" those painful years."
5,SUPERBLY WRITTEN - COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN,"An excellent example of one who was able to overcome extreme adversity as a child. The resilience evident shows that there's always hope. Hopefully all cultures can see where parental guidance provided in the correct manner can allow children to blossom to their fullest potential. It is so unfortunate that Adeline Yen Mah was pushed to her potential through negative reinforcement. Her success makes me wonder what would have been her outcome had she had positive reinforcement. BRAVA, BRAVA, BRAVAI hope that a director, of the caliber of Amy Tan, will make this book into a book on the same level as Joy Luck Club..... Stick to the book, add nothing, be true to Adeline's plight. No Hollywood gloss, just human spirit."
2,good effort but no merit.,"Being chinese myself growing up in China, Hongkong and the US, I can understand some of the troubles Ms Mah went through. But her story is neither particularly touching nor interesting. There are millions and millions Chinese women out there who suffered more than her and would be dying to have the opportunities she was given. The whole book is basically a reader's digest version of what happened to her over the past 50 years in her own view. There is no details to events and no analysis of other people's action. Nonetheless, it's nice to see such book because it brings out the inners feelings of millions of chinese female readers. The 2 stars is solely for its effort, not its merit"
2,No sympathy for the author,"I must admit, the book kept my interest but only because I kept waiting for the author to stop playing victim and move on with her life. Unfortunately it never came. Adeline Yen Mah details how her great aunt defied her own foot binding at age 3 and went on to open a very successful bank in China and how her aunt works at that bank and never marries; both women defying cultural norms and with obvious admiration from the author. However, Ms. Yen Mah then justifies her own kowtowing to her distant father and vindictive step-mother as ""the way it is in Chinese families"". This is after her step-mother and father are less than filial towards her paternal grandfather. By the end of the book it is apparent Ms. Yeh Mah was only sticking around for the inheritance than never came. And then she cries foul and writes a tell-all book. It was a rather off-putting read."
4,"Good, easy read. I loved it!","Great book and very quick/easy to read. It's amazing that the author was able to have as much success as she has, in spite of the horrible relationship with her (rich) family. It goes to show that money isn't everything. I am not Chinese, nor is my family rich, but I can still relate to this story and learn from it."
4,Heartbreaking and disturbing,"A fine example of how a family can have so much and yet have so little. I believe Dr. Mah was victimized as much by her Chinese culture, which places great emphasis on filial devotion, saving face and family togetherness, as by Niang, who is a human nightmare! To a Westerner the obvious reaction would be ""get over it"", but, as is obvious from the narrative, it seems cultural values as well as the yearning for love and acceptance were a large part of what kept Adeline coming back for more. Very, very sad story."
5,Great story about 20th century Chinese culture.,"Adeline Yen Mah has written an absorbing story about her childhood in China. I found it very difficult to put down. It is the story of a Chinese family and how they dealt with all the political and cultural changes of this century, and how one daughter yearns for love and acceptance from her uncaring parents."
5,an incredable story which gets to the heart of life and love,"It is a well written story, I was unable to put the book down. Adeline Yen Mah writes from the heart and places her own personal stuggles in relationship to the history of China. I am amazed at how strong a child""s need is for parental acceptance and love. I also received an small understanding of the Chinese culture and how they view family and work. Don't miss this book it is well worth reading!"
2,Sour Grapes,"It isn't easy growing up in a dysfuntional family and the times she grew up in were turbulent at best. But she wasn't abandoned like so many female Chinese and she had enough to eat, clothes to wear and an excellent education that prepared her to make her own professional living, plus she had the invaluable support of a loving aunt. So, why write a book spewing out such vitriol? And a pretty poorly written book at that. Better to read the magnificant, vastly more informative ""Wild Swans.""By the way, I bought this book a few years ago in hard cover after reading ""Wild Swans"" and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that this drivel made it the the best-seller list.If you want a memoir about surviving your family, read ""The Liar's Club"" - the author not only survived but overcame and forgave - arriving on the other side whole."
3,"Tragic beginning, whiny ending.","I enjoyed the beginning of this book. It presented a slice of history about which I was uninformed, wrapped in the personal true story of a little girl persecuted by her family. By the end of the book, though, I felt the author was more determined to make her case against her stepmother than to write a compelling story. The book did not hold my interest to the end, although I did finish it. I wanted to celebrate the triumph of the author over her painful start in life. Instead, I read an endless list of family misdeeds. Victimization of a helpless child is tragic. Wallowing in it as an adult is annoying."
4,It was kind of neat,"My opinion of this book was that it was alittle alright if you love to cry. But then many parts of it seemed to be alittle to farfetched. Like how she cried because all she cared about was to be accepted by her father when she lost everything. Even though that is the right thing, she acted alittle to ""good"" and it was just annoying. She wouldn't admit that she was actually hurt that she didn't get that ownership to what her father had left her. But then she could've been AT least telling us that she wanted those things.But then what I had just said was a bit too mean. But sort of true. Plus the fact that if you read this book you would JUST have to give sympathy to her and her childhood. For since she had been through something so rough and hard that you could not believe it. Awesome. Just simply. Awesome."
5,An Amazing story of overcoming a horrible childhood!,"My Grandmother read it and then I did. I am 17 and I had feelings towards it. I enjoyed learning about the culture, the triumphs of the author. A perfect summer book that you won't be able to put down."
5,A pleasant surprise!,"I was somewhat wary about another version of the 'Cinderella' story. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was instantly captured by the storytelling and the easy-to-read style. I could not believe that someone actually lived through such a horrific, soap-opera-like life! The cultural and historic perspectives of the story added a whole new dimension. I commend Adeline Mah for her courage."
2,Works fine as a personal story but...plays into stereotypes,"The author is a fairly good writer. Her narrative is descriptive and flows nicely. However, her books seems to pander to the Western masses who love to eat up stories about poor oppressed ""Chinese daughters."" This book is another one of those ""exotic oppressed Asian girl/woman"" books that indulge Orientalist fantasies that westerners have towards Chinese and non-western cultures in general. I am offended at the way she implies that her story is ""typical"" of Chinese females. I would have given the book more stars if she had just written a book called ""Falling Leaves: The Memoir of an Unwanted DAUGHTER"" which would have worked well as a memoir about a child (not a ""Chinese"" child but a CHILD, a human being) who triumps over her emotionally abusive parents. Instead she chooses to emphasize the ""oppressed Chinese daughter"" angle to cater to people with Orientalist fantasies."
5,Lovely,"Beautifully written story by Adeline. She captures every moment from her life so well and the story is told extremely well. Filled with sad and tragic events in her life from her childhood, but it's a compelling story of someone who could very easily have given up. The background of China's customs, culture, and society are captured well. A must read!"
3,The ties that bind,"This autobiography proves that someone can be very intelligent and successful, yet still be insecure enough to make poor choices (the author married her first husband upon 6 weeks acquaintance and she stayed with him despite battering) and unable to simply turn away from a spiteful, suspicious family. The historical material on China was excellent and I found it particularly interesting that Adeline's father survived and prospered under all regimes. I also was incredulous that she could serve so well in the hospital when her home life was in such turmoil. She is certainly a strong woman, exemplary in her treatment of her aunt (who really deserved her love), yet she could not get rid of the wish to please her father. Readers should enjoy seeing Adeline triumph and attain ""a peaceful serenity"""
4,Engrossing and touching,"This book is well worth reading, as it is both engrossing and suspenseful. The people described in it were so mean and spiteful to the author when she was young, I had to keep reading to find out whether the situation would change when she became an adult. I felt it was understandable that the author kept trying, despite repeated rebuffs, to win the approval of her family. Children who are denied unconditional love become damaged adults who continually seek the approval they were earlier denied. Therefore, I was not annoyed with the author for her seeming naivete in continually trying to please her impossible family. Rather, she seemed very human and vulnerable, and I found her tale heartbreaking. Despite the painful theme, the book is not depressing, as the author does have some triumphs. I recommend it as an enjoyable read."
1,Get over yourself!,"Really? I mean really? She was born into a rich Chinese family with a maid, a home, a place to sleep, and given home cooked meals. The entire book is about how everything in life is not fair and has a huge undertone of self-entitlement. At no point was she ""unwanted""...there may have been typical Chinese family favoritism, but really, her life was not that bad. Her whiny narration and constant ""poor me"" attitude had me rolling my eyes and annoyed throughout the book.There is no development of any of the characters. Her chronological story telling is all over the place and very choppy. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone...there is really no takeaway from her memoir, besides, ""shut the heck up you spoiled brat."" I'm sure some of her siblings have passed away and I'm sure there has to be some revenge behind her authoring this book and painting everyone around her as villians.Yes, her step mother was a witch, but quit your whining and stop trying to change people."
2,Chinese Cinderalla,"The ONLY reason I bought this book is that I belong to a book club, and they decided they wanted to read Falling Leaves. I haven't finished the book (I'm on page 80 or so) and sincerely I have not found the book captivating. The characters are more like caricatures, the print is too small, and I don't like to read sad books unless they're classics. I have my own problems without reading sad books. I guess it's OK for a long trip, but the print is so small it gives me eyestrain, and the characters lack personality. Besides, this is 2009, and it talks about events from before World War II, the Cultural Revolution -- all that is old."
1,Confusing,"If you are someone who gets bored, confused, or lost easily, DO NOT READ THIS!! I had to resd this for school, wich I wasn't happy about to begin with. What didn't make it easy to understand was that it jumped around so much. In one chapter her dad is meeting her mom, then in the next is about her dads youth. I seriously do not recommend this book."
4,"Potent, riveting drama","The harrowing story of Adeline Yen Mah's terrible childhood will stay with me a long time. I have read a number of reviews here, complaining of the whining in this book. Having lived with an emotionally abusive parent, I found her story riveting. I related to so much of her yearning to be loved, wanted and accepted for who she was. The unending plotting of her ""wicked stepmother"" ultimately scarred the entire family. Everyone in that family learned to play the game. While perhaps her view of her own place in this family may be skewed by time, it is very hard to argue with the scenes of a small child sent to an orphanage, while her family still lived. I read this book in 2 days, always worrying about what would happen next, and fearing for what I felt would be a sad ending to a sad story. I was partly right."
5,The BEST Book I Have Ever Read,"Falling Leaves was an AMAZING book. It was touching and heart-wrenching, and I could not put it down. Adeline Yen Mah's story is so sad, and one realizes all the obstacles she had to overcome. I highly recommend this book for all mature readers, as it is an excellent and eye-opening work of art."
2,Disappointing,"Take a good look at the map that Amazon displays with this item, because you won't find it on the CD. Although this CD does contain a large number of works by Richard Francis Burton, including his entire, unexpurgated translation of Sheherazade's famous tales, all of it is available FREE OF CHARGE from the Project Gutenberg site. The seller has simply copied a lot of downloaded texts--warts and all (and some of the warts are doozies) to a CDR, slapped on a very plain label, and sat back to collect the profits. You can do the same and save yourself 25 bucks."
5,Perfect make your own card kit,"This card kit was perfect. We used it to make thank you notes. My daughter is 9 but still needed a little bit of help (she can be a little glue happy). She could have done them 100% on her own but I wanted them to come out a bit neater. We both had so much fun. The glitter is very fine, so it looks so pretty on the card. The book that comes w/ it is cool too. We got a lot of ideas for making cards and it made us think of other things we could use. I am buying a 2nd kit so we can always make our own cards. I hope they make a Christmas one."
2,Little Rascals 2-pack rating,It was not what I expected. So boring to watch. Disappointed. I wish there were small previews for these movies so that I can choose carfully.
1,save your money,I thought this toy looked great but soon found differently. My 3 and 5 year old tried to play but it did not hold their interest at all. The toy is quite cheaply made and I keep finding it apart after it is used. There are so many great games and the price on this one does not warrant purchasing. Save your money!!!
5,a fantasy classic,"the book is probably one of the 4 or 5 classic post-Tolkien fantasies. Convincing world, interesting characters, complex plot. the only tragedy is that nothing he wrote since matched it and the most recent books (demon king etc.) utter rubbish."
5,excellent - a class act,"I already have this series in paperback and have read it a number of timesbut then decided to get them in Kindle.The rift war saga is really well written - the author is a class act as far as these 3 books go.The plots are well developed, the characters very clear - its a really good read.I have tried other books by Feist some years ago - but was disappointed.Maybe I should try some more again........... one always worriesthat authors only have one book or series in them..."
5,Tremendous !!!,"This was the first fantasy book I ever read, and have now lost count the number of times I have the entire Midkemia/Kelewan series. Each time I read it I find the same enjoyment I had when I read it the first time. The way Feist has build the characters/worlds in my mind surpasses the works by Tolkien."
5,Unputdownable!!!!,I dont think I ate for the three days that I read this book! It's probably a good job it wasn't a few thousand pages long or I might have died trying to finish it! I have to say that nothing in the realms of phantasy literature has ever come close to it and I have reade a few books!!I think if I had to be one character from all the books I have ever read it would have to be Tomas... He's one one mean mother and he gets the girl at the end of the day(even if she is a few hundred years old!)
4,Brilliant,Loved this book when I read it when I was about 23. Loved it even more the second time around.Excellent characters that you want to know more about.Brilliant writing.The two worlds are just so vividly painted.
3,Average but entertaining,Maybe I'm not representative of the target audience - I presume the book is aimed at younger readers. A nice book and story that plateaus after the first section.
5,Brilliant Read (Again),"This is the only fictional story I have read more than once, I read the Magician many years ago and decided to download the revised edition. I am not disappointed, reliving Thomas and Pug's journey (in more detail) is just as exciting the second time round as it was the first time.A read that you will not be able to put down right from the first chapter!!"
2,yet another fantasy book...,"I approached this book with, well, great expectations. A few minutes after finishing it I said ""Well! Wow!"". However, as time goes by, I cannot stop thinking that actually the book is not so good. It is rather like a first attempt of the author to write fantasy. Not only is it full of stereotypes (maybe this is a book who generated these stereotypes, I don't know). The characters are so thin that after a few weeks I have forgotten all of them. They are far from having the precise contours of Tolkien's heroes. They are far from having the depth of Ursula le Guin's characters. Even in the Wheel of Time cycle one could find heroes that are better realised than these ones. The story itself? Well, not big deal. Again, the stereotype of a stranger that tries to invade, and intestine plottings to add some (watery) thrill. A lot of scenes are there only to help the book growing thick. All in all, an easy book: easy to read and easy to forget."
5,Magician,"One word to sum up this book: WOW. Of course, for me, the first half was boring. But, once I got into it, I could not believe I had neglected it! I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to try and finish it . . . I didn't that day, but I did the next! The books holds a mystical power that just made it one of the best books I have ever read.And the ending? Definantly my favourite ending of all time. I couldn't believe it. I never, ever, ever, ever, ever find books with good endings. I mean, they're alright, but this . . . its was the perfect balance of an opening for a new book, no second book, it was humourous, inviting, perfect and everything about it just screamed, ""AWESOME!""I got it as a birthday present - one which I now hold as one of the best presents ever. It really was a splendid read."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"Grow up to fight the dark lord with your best mate, but gotta stop that alien invasion first.Feist takes a fantasy epic that it seems grew out of his own fantasy roleplaying games, and gives the standard plot a pit of a tweak. While there is your evil dark lord figure to deal with, there is also an alien invasion (but of humans from a different culture, technology and type of magic).One boy ends up in the other world with a touch of Shogun, learning magic, while the other ens up in a situation a lot more like Michael Moorcock's Corum.An extremely well done fantasy adventure story that even appealed to my dad, of all people, being a bit of the old fashioned type of tale."
4,READ THIS BOOK!!!!,This is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. The follow sequels of Silverthorn are even better.Magician does start of slowly to be honest. Young magician finding his way in the world etc etc. It picks up pace quickly after the first 200 pages. The final book of the trilogy is probably the best of the three.I rate this right up there with the Eddings books. Perhaps not the same poise and delivery that those series' have (The Mallorean and can't remember the other) but well worth picking up.
3,Too much ground to cover.,"The idea of the book is great, but it fails to deliver on some key areas. I was expecting more of a ""cool tips and tricks"" for Visual Studio and less of an overall coverage of the .NET Framework.Yes they do a good job at tying both of these topics together but then the book should have been titled something like ""Introduction to the .NET Framework using Visual Studio .NET""Enough coverage of Debugging techniques and Deployment using Visual Studio .NET is what I would say are the two most valuable topics covered successfully in this book.Overall it could have been better had the content been revised to a more specific topic. I am not entirely happy I bought the book but neither am I totally bummed out that I did... so unlike me, think about what you expect out of it before you purchase."
2,Not what was expecting,I agree with Jeff P's comments. I was expecting something like Beck Zaratian's guide to VS6 - Tips on using all the new features in IDE. This ain't it. Am C/C++ programmer trying to quickly pick up C#/VB.Net Would recommend spend $ on Erik Brown's Windows Forms C# or Karl Moore's VB.Net books instead as you can learn IDE just as well (I thought better) and learn some useful things while doing so.
3,For beginners only...,"I bought this because of the other good reviews, but after reading about half the book, I've come to the conclusion that unless you've never used VS.NET, don't bother getting this book.It spends far too much covering topics that could be figure out in a matter of minutes simply by playing around with the interface, and spends nearly no time covering advanced topics like large scale project collaboration.In other words, if you're looking for a book that will give you the cool hints and tricks that will really make you a productive VS.NET developer, look elsewhere."
5,For Total Beginners Starting VS.NET Languages,"This is my second review on this book but this time I am looking at it form the prospective a brand new programmer wanting to get their feet wet with the overall VS.NET languages and tools.This book is great for the beginner programmer. It is very clearly written and covers enough detail to get you started. From here, you could branch out into the respective languages and have some idea of the overall context.If someone has had some programming background with Microsoft languages, you still might just want to start with a book on the language of choice...but for the beginner...this is a good choice.Just don't expect an in-depth VS IDE book!Earl"
2,"Good intro, lacks depth","I was really disappointed with this book, as it covers much of what you probably would get out of any C#, ASP.NET or VB.NET book. What it lacks (given the insane number of features in Visual Studio) is some in depth looks at the features, settings and goodies included in the product. I know I'm not getting the most out of VS, and this book is partially to blame."
2,Too Small for Price,The item you get is soo not worth the price. They were what they are advertised to be except that the amount you actually get is underwhelming to say the least.
3,StiCkies!,"This is for anyone who enjoys labeling and personalizing everything they own Dr. Who. It would make a nice office gift or gift for a friend who enjoys the show. Matt Smith who plays the 11th doctor is featured on the cover. I personally do not enjoy this image since David Tennant was my favorite Doctor (10th). If you are gifting a friend who appreciates the Rose romance more than Amy's legacy it might be a better idea to look for something else. The bookish binding makes this gift especially unique and cute. Tapered rounded edges on the stickies add to the effect. Very nice. Weight is about the same as a deck of cards and of similar proportions which is not bad... Included on the page / stickies are ""To Do"" ""Time"" and ""Dimension"" which is a nice feature but with limited space it does not serve as well unless you are making party notes or a quick jot for the store. Overall - cute."
4,Cutest little Daleks ever.,"This little book of sticky notes makes a fantastic small gift for the Whovian in your life.The first time we saw the colorful Daleks, I sang ""Go Go Dalek Rangers"" so that's we call them in my family. The little Daleks are very small and cute. The biggest notes in this are the ones with the 11th Doctor. The TARDIS and Dalek notes are faded so you can write over them. I recommend black ink.I knocked one star off because they aren't really sticky, and in fact started coming loose from the book pretty quickly. It's still a great idea and gift."
1,Stay Away,The only thing I learned from this book was the use of the -verbose:gc Java command-line option that prints a report to syserr each time the garbage collector runs.
1,Do not bother,This is a very poor book. It is very much a beginners book and it does not do anything but state the bleedin obvious.
2,Inexpensive but not worth it,"If you need consistent, dependable heat for an aching back this is NOT the heating pad for you. I have digenerative disc disease in my lower back & have quite abit of back pain. If I can use a heating pad at work or when I finally sit down at home in the evenings it reduces the amount of medicine I have to take.I bought this at Walmart for work because of the price (11.99). I used it 2 days & returned it.It does heat up quickly & does have a nice, long cord.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:-While it heats up quickly to the highest setting it doesn't maintain the heat!I don't know why. After only 20-30 minutes, you realize there is barely anyheat at all, like you turned it down to the low setting.-It's small & rather stiff so it's hard to place to be effective.-Auto shut-off. I prefer one that I can de-activate the auto shut-off.In conclusion, I'll spend a little more and get one that meets my needs."
1,Won't work with an extension cord!,"You'd think that the manufacturer would realize that heating pads, more so than most other appliances, may have to be used where there's no wall outlet handy. But NO, this manufacturer has designed a heating pad that won't work properly with an extension cord. It comes on initially just fine, but once it goes into automatic shut-off mode, the on/off/set temp switch will not operate unless the pad is plugged directly into the wall. I'm very glad I didn't spend more on a fancier model of this heating pad. Also, the CSR at Kaz claimed that this limitation is described in the owner's manual. It isn't."
1,Waste of Money--Broken after 2 days of light usage.,This ugly blue polyester covered heat pad broke less than 48 hours after I bought it. I used it three times within my house. Nothing crazy. When it worked it was nice but what's the point? I think I'm going to try a different manufacturer.
5,Useful AND Entertaining,"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book on the plane and trying out things on my laptop. Steve's solution to the ^*&$*& Word numbering problem alone (which has caused me no end of grief with every contract revision I do) is easily worth the cost of the book. More importantly, Steve's sense of humor and style is arguably the best in the industry.I highly recommend this book for beginners and experts alike."
4,A sanity saver,"I am still pretty much a neophite where computers are concerned, so I bought this book hoping that it could get me out of the ""messes"" I'm always getting into. It really DOES help! Thank you!!! Steve Bass, I'm now searching for other books you have written."
5,The Cog's are Back!!,"Oh how I love this group and their unmistakeable sound! I couldn't wait for the new release to come out. Browsing thru the CD rack @ Circuit City in Culver City, Ca, I was shocked to see that they had Adventures in Black Sunshine. So shocked, I screamed in the store!The folks in there looked at me like I was crazy, but if they only knew! It's tough to find Incognito's recordings in Southern Ca. Well needless to say, I love the cd! Hearing Maysa and Bluey together again is so wonderful. I loved the last album, ""Who Needs Love"", but I did miss that ""Maysa"" sound. This is REAL music indeed. Keep up the excellent work Bluey, and keep sending those powerful, meaningful messages in your music."
5,Excellent CD!,"I had never even heard of this group until my husband ordered it from one of those CD clubs. I put it on, and within the first 30 seconds, I LOVED this CD - no exagerration! It is upbeat, jazzy, funky... I haven't stopped listening to it. It's a shame you can't hear music like this on the radio, but then again, it makes you feel privileged having been lucky enough to have discovered it. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Masterpiece,"I am an English man living in rural Germany so not really in touch with what once was lovingly referred to as the Acid Jazz scene in 90's UK. I have a large selection of Jazz/Funk, Jazz Funk etc ranging from Incoginto, EW&F, Quincy jones etc, but was and still am completey blown away by this release. Keep it going, I can't get enough."
5,Tu-tu-tuu,"Great album, but if you are familiar with the Incognito art, you will certainly enjoy in this work of art"
5,Great book for everybody who would like to know more about War in former Yugoslavia,Gen. McKenzie wrote a great book about peacekeeping in Bosnia. He is very honest man with a lot of experience in peacekeeping. He had hard time in Bosnia because beside war on the field there was a very strong media and political war. He did his best. Read it!More things you can find if you read some reports of French Gen. Morion (reading his reports to UN). Useful link: http://www.srebrenica-report.com/
1,"Horrible book! Propaganda material paid by the Serbian Union Congress, a serbian lobby group headquotered in California","While it is difficult to ascertain exactly how much has been directed towards payment for speakers and journalists, the SUC and Serbnet have set up a special fund for this purpose. Based on former UN General Lewis MacKenzie's own admission which was later corroborated by Serbnet -- that he was receiving over $15,000 per speaking engagement -- the amount spent on MacKenzie represents more than what the SUC is paying to PR firms such as Manatos and Manatos, Inc.A complete referenced study can be seen on this serbian website:http://www.freeserbia.net/Documents/Lobby.htmlPlease do not buy this propaganda material!!!"
1,MacKenzie has no capacity to understand events,"General MacKenzie was unable to understand what was occuring in Bosnia. His book shows no sensitivity to the land or people. As a result, he offered failed solutions and rather disgraceful opinions as to how the conflict should be solved, all of which eventualy proved to be incorrect."
4,Dazzling Indeed,"This is an honest and forthright work, particularly for a newcomer to dragonflies. I wished there were more pictures but that only reflects my increased appetite for more.Virgilius DiBiase"
2,"Gritty, but hollow novel about a thug and his life..","From previous reviews, I got the idea that ""Never come Morning"" would be gritty, and a masterpiece. Well, that's not the case. It is quite gritty, with EVERYONE a crook, from a Polish barber who is also a pimp, from the one-eyed police detective. The story follows Bruno, a thug who dreams of well..being the Great White Hope. Of course, we know he's a thug, and will always be nothing but a thug. Bruno and his thuggish friends talk in a Chicago dialect that grates on your nerves. Algren is not Mark Twain, so it further alienates the reader when you want to hear English you can recognize. I felt zero sypathy for Bruno's predicament, and I felt sick that Steffi would see anything in this character."
5,Way to go,"I'm a 19 year old girl, and I thought the book was great, so I know that all the guys out there with questions about themselves, their bodies, and girls will love it. Its funny, its realistic, and well, from a girl's perspective, its all true.Guys will benefit very much from owning this book. And girls can benefit as well, because there is a lot of insight on how guys think as well! A must-read for everyone!"
5,Excellent Product,"I have used this product for almost a year and love it. You can download the books you buy or html files from the Internet. It's a wonderful way to surf the Web. Just download the html files you're interested in to your PC and run them through the eBook program on the PC and download to the eBook. An extra advantage is that you can read this in bed without the light on, thus not disturbing your wife (or husband)! I highly recommend it. Joel"
4,I'm impressed!,"I really love my reader. The BEST part is I can actually read in bed, which was something that really turned my opinion on e-books around. The books are a lot cheaper than regular books, I stumbled on Crossroadspub.com and am amazed at that and other sites decent prices and availability of e-books. No more out of stock books! The only bad thing about it is the weight. It does get heavy after awhile. Hopefully they'll change that in the near future!"
2,BUY A BOOK!,"This video is not worth the time or money. Buy a book with more information. It is a poor quality video. The students demonstrate the poses and the teacher talkes you through them. You will get more information and poses from a book, for less. If you hate books, this is the video for you. There is no yoga routine, just a demonstration of each pose."
3,its cool,dvd worked for a while but unfortunately it got magnetized but had no idea that patti was ronald reagans daughter
3,New and old,"I like the words of the new hymns. Up to date and timely. I am having complaints from my congregation about the ""old"" music and some of the music for the hymns, although familiar, aren't any more singable."
2,Disappointing View of the Summit,"I was disappointed with the quality of this book. There are great descriptions of climbing Everest, it is true, but in light of the finding of Mallory and public knowledge of his close relationship with his wife, it seems crass indeed to have him galloping off to a secret life with his Bloomsbury friends. Mallory was not the sort of man to carry on a secret life- his 1920/1 trip to Ireland notwithstanding; he was remarkably unBritish in his frankness concerning feelings and opinions. This book does great disservice to the memory of Mallory and Irvine."
5,Belue's editing makes this hard to put down!,"I am not an historian, but have read many of the books that used the ""Draper papers"" as their primary source material, and marvelled at breadth of our knowledge of Boone, his time, and his frontier contemporaries. Anyone who has studied this chapter in American history has probably marvelled at the exhaustive trove of material left by Lyman Draper. Now, with TFB's superb editing, non-professional students of history have access to the source material. This is a ""must have"" for any student of the ""Old Northwest"" and its memorable characters. No work of fiction could possibly be this absorbing. And, as a valuable historical footnote, Ted Franklin Belue concisely introduces us to Lyman Draper, to help us put the ""Life of Daniel Boone"" in its proper context."
3,You're gonna need an interpreter,"I was excited when I saw this book, not only is a part of history but I love old school down home recipes. This book was written by people who did not truly understand slavery or post-slavery dialect. Some of the wording simply does not make sense. The afterword is helpful in terms of translating the measurements. But it is still very challenging to understand the recipes. I have yet to cook any of the recipes, because I am still translating them. If you have the time to devote, it would be a fun project."
1,Not helpful at all.,This is out-of-date and too general. I was hoping for more detailed information. It will be donated to a resource cancer center so hopefully it will help others.
3,good book,Was a basic review of todays procedures for application and treatment in a modern chemotherapy treatment facility. Was somewhat helpful as a refresher..
2,She is much more entertaining than she comes across here,"I like Sheri and looked forward to her book. But this was disappointing. I could not relate to it even vicariously, and it left me with a bad feeling. I didn't keep my copy.I would highly recommend her radio show and her blogs over this (maybe she is more effective in a shorter format?)"
3,Just OK,This book just rambles on and on about the same thing for pages. How many different ways can you say the same thing>
5,Exactly as expected,If you are looking for Surf Ninjas this DVD is great. This is a movie that is not for everyone (different tastes) but it was a movie that hubby and I grew up watching. I purchased this as a gag/nostalgia gift but our kids have taken to watching it more than us now.. It was exactly what I expected.
3,It is your destiny!,"Ah, the dude movies on the 90's. You have movies like Three Ninjas, Surf Ninjas and Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles. What do all these movies all have in common? There are just down right fun! I'll admit the story line of Surf Ninjas is a little simple minded, but you can't help but enjoy it. And, it's one of those kid movies that you can make fun of. I watched this movie a lot as a kid. It was one of my favorites. Don't ask me why? But, like I said earlier, its simple. You'll laugh at it in spite of yourself. I'd have to say the Leslie Nielsen and Rob Schneider are the real stars of the show. Rob Schneider is funny no matter what movie he's in. And, the thought of Leslie Nielsen as an evil warlord who will stop at nothing to keep our ninja warriors from reaching their destiny is too hilarious to be true. Throwing in an old beach boy's song with a twist does add to the fun. If you are looking for a fun, ninja crazy good time then look no further, Dude! Its your destiny!"
5,love this movie,"I remember watching this movie as a kid, its still silly but I love it. The comedy is light hearted and the characters are easy to understand. This is mainly a kids/all ages movie."
3,Beer and popcorn,"C'mon. The title is ""Surf Ninjas"". What do you expect?""Surf Ninjas"" is unlikely to win any award -- unless there is an award for movies that don't take themselves too seriously. This is a Southern California martial arts ninja romp. A ridiculous premise built around the martial arts skills and comic timing of a good cast. Don't expect to learn any deep lessons and you won't feel you wasted your money."
5,Surf Ninjas,"I watched this movie several times as a child. When I realized I only had it on VHS, I knew it was time to look for it on DVD on Amazon. This is a great family movie. My favorite quote: ""Money can't buy knives."""
5,great movie,i was a kid when the movie came out and i loved it then and i love it now. I hope to show it to my kids one day.
4,Probably only worth buying if you liked it as a kid,"Well, I'll begin by saying that my review of this movie is somewhat biased, since I first saw it as a young kid, I must have been 12 or 13 when it came out.That having been said, at 22 I still really enjoy watching, and am glad to see it out on DVD now. Sure it's cheesy and all, but if you can just relax and not worry about that, it's got some great lines and situations, and will keep you laughing until the end.If you didn't enjoy the first Ninja Turtle movie, or the Naked Gun series, don't buy this DVD. If you did, then rent it some night and give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised."
4,Horribly Awesome!,"This is a movie you hate to love, but you MUST love it. It's innocent, brainless, and completely moronic, but in the best way. Rob Schneider provides comedy relief for a movie that's ridiculous to begin with. And, I have two words for you...Tone Loc! I mean this is a motley crew of characters, and the plot is plotless, yet it's fun, and has nostalgia merit for anyone fond of late 80's early 90's. Ernie Reyes Jr. is cool as he's always been and it's good to see him working with his father, Reyes Sr. Basically, if you don't take yourself, or life too seriously, you'll find some humor in this movie!"
5,Great Movie,We have loved this movie for many years because it is entirely ridiculous and hilarious! No one will be disappointed with this purchase because the price is so great!
2,Watch For Those Biceps,"""Surf Ninjas"" has one of the most vapid and pointless plotlines in existence in that great place Hollywood. However, it redeems itself with lengthy shots of Ernie Reyes's beautiful pecs. Two stars, one for each arm."
3,Surf Ninjas,"We have not watched this one yet as the other 3 ninja movies we had affected our grandson in such a way as he started kicking and hitting people and animals much the same as he saw from watching the movies. His behavior got worse shortly during and after viewing the movies. For the time being, we are not letting him view any 3 ninja movies. He is 4-1/2 years old."
2,SURFIN FOR LAUGHS,"Made at the height of the Ninja craze in the early 90s, SURF NINJAS is a pretty flat and lifeless movie. Leslie Nielsen is wasted in what is merely a glorified cameo and the movie's youthful stars don't have the oomph to carry the movie, although an early Rob Schneider is a boost to the proceedings. Unless you're extremely fond of the ninja genre, this one's better avoided."
1,CRAP-SHO,"Why are there so many bad horror movies at Blockbuster? How do they even make it past the student film showcase? Side-Sho is god aweful. I don't mean the type of bad that its so bad its good (Troma), I mean the filmmakers of this movie tried so hard and they wasted good money. DO NOT BUY/RENT/OR WASTE the 1 hour 1/2 on this crapfest. It has to be a student film from some community college somewhere, because the acting is the worst and its a ripoff of every good horror movie of the past 5 years. there isn't even NUDITY to make up for any of this. there is literally ONE small boob. thats it. ONE! I'd rather watch my dying grandmother take a dump than sit through CRAP SHO one more time. The filmmakers of this movie should be literally crapped on for an 1 1/2 hours. Amateurs!"
2,Skip this Side Sho,"Poorly filmed, chock full of bad acting (and fat hoochies), Side Sho is a bad idea put on film. The story is a copy of ""The Hills Have Eyes"", which is part of the problem. A bunch of yuppies decide to go off the beaten path and wind up getting torn apart by mutant redneck circus folk.The director must of used old film stock, that probably explains why this cliche riddled film is so grainy. Do yourself a favor - buy something else."
1,Side Blows,"This is just another quickly-made, low-budget, quirky, cheesy horror film. Take it for what it is, and have a few laughs while watching.The reviews that give this movie 5 stars are quite hilarious because this movie is in no way a five star movie.Enjoy."
1,this movie is the worst crap i have seen this year,This is by far the worst horror movie I have seen all year. I watch horror almost exclusively so I have seen some bad movies but this now rates the worst.
1,"So bad, it isn't even funny","Seriously, don't waste your time. I like cheesy, bad horror movies, but this was just painful to watch. Pay attention to the 1 and 2 star reviews. If it fell into the ""so bad, it's funny"" category, I might have given it 2 or 3 stars. This was just bad."
2,CREEP SHO,"A family straight out of a sixties sitcom makes the familiar cinematic mistake of taking a backroad to see the sights and end up at a fallen down sideshow full of inbred freaks who want to breed with women...ho-hum. It's all been done before and better.The ""acting"" is laughable; the makeup is terrible and you won't believe the ""dog/freak"".A pretty bad movie!"
3,THOSE FETUSES IN JARS WERE REALLY THEIR BABIES,"WHAT THIS MOVIE'S REALLY ABOUT IS ONLY INBREDS LIVE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA.THEY KEEP TO THEMSELVES.THEY KILL ANYBODY WHO GO INTO THEIR TERRITORY.HOW THAT CAME TO BE WAS:A LONG TIME AGO,PRISONERS WERE DOING WORK.THEY WERE BEING WATCHED BY THEIR PRISON GUARD.THEY ALL STUCK TOGETHER,AND KILLED THE GUARD.OVER THE YEARS,THEY MADE THEIR HOME AND LIVING IN THAT AREA.THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT-SO THEY ALL STAYED THERE.WOMEN WERE SCARCE-I GUESS THERE WASN'T MANY WOMEN PRISONERS.SO-THEY ALL MATED WITH EACH OTHER,AND WHEN THE KIDS WERE OF AGE TO MATE-THEY MATED WITH THEM TOO.ANY WOMEN TOURISTS THAT GO INTO THEIR TERRITORY-THEY KEEP FOR BREEDING PURPOSES ONLY.THEY KEEP THEM TIED UP SO THEY CAN'T ESCAPE.IT WAS AN INTERSTING MOVIE.WEIRD,BUT IT KEEPS YOUR CURIOUSITY UP.NOT SCARY OR GORY."
5,Side Sho,"I was very lucky to see this great new show and I definitely wasn't disappointed. An excellent plot and very catchy story line. Great actors. Some of the scenes are quite good and will keep you glued to the screen. Check this film out!! Good entertainment for adults, not for super young children. I Highly recommend. If we get lucky, there will be a sequel"
2,Electrical failure,"I purchased the 9102B Air King 12"" Oscillating fan on November 18, 2011. It quit running on 12/18/2011. There is an Open in the electrical circuitry which I cannot locate in the motor."
3,"Cheap plastic, not polished looking","For the price I paid I expected more. The fan plastic looks cheaply molded, feels cheap too. You need to manually adjust the tilt and there is a great clicking sound, which is much too forced, it doesn't inspire confidence in the longevity of the adjustable tilt mechanism. I never adjust the tilt anymore. I prop it up on books. It blows, it doesn't shudder, and it is relatively quiet - not super quiet. I use it in the plant room to move the air for the orchids. Definitely over priced."
3,excellent stories - but not as good as 'Child of Mine',"I read 'Child of Mine' during my pregnancy many times and since then many many times over. I expected to find the same joy in reading this new collection of parenting stories, but although most are well written, sometimes poignant, definitely moving - I did not find that as a whole the book worked well. I think the editor was perhaps a liitle confused as to the true focus of the book, and as a result the stories veer off to strange directions, not really connected and not giving a satisfying feeling at the end of the reading. Still I have to say that I am glad I read it as each tale gives a new perspective omn the daunting joy that is parenthhood, and I do recommend it as an addition to Child of Mine."
3,The Underbelly,"It described New York City well in the 50's. but I guess the 60's 70's and up into the 90's. The characters were strong, between whores pimps, thieves and all other criminals envolved but the plot line lacked in my opinion. It did show street life in all its shambles of human debris and the police were done well like ""Dragnet"" was. I guess I would say strength in background and characters, weakness in plot."
5,A trip back to New York City's past,"A wonderful book, I cannot praise it enough. Sara Gran got it right. Terrific atmosphere of New York City and the days when there was no real treatment for heroin addiction. Her characters ring true and you can feel their hopelessness and desperation. I can't wait to read her other books."
4,A great read,"Dope will take you back to the seamier side of NYC in the 50's. The setting is so well pictured you feel yourself traveling along with the heroine, Joe Flannigan, through the underbelly of the city.I love this young author. She is an explorer of genres. I read her other two books, Saturn's Return, and Come Closer, but I never expected a noir detective from her, and a female no less - think Becall not Bogart. You'll really enjoy this book."
4,Hardboiled with a feminine touch,"Sara Gran has the style of classic hardboiled fiction down perfect, hitting all the right notes from start to finish. What really sets her apart though, from the Hammetts and the Chandlers, is the woman's perspective. Her story of Josephine Hannigan, a former junkie turned amateur detective in 1950s New York, employs most of the standard tropes of these kinds of plots, but she takes more care to show us the ladies on the outer edges of the story that usually take a backseat to the macho gunsalls and dirty crime bosses. There is an added sadness to her tale--given the roles these women often play, their existence is a rough one, and not one where they can play at being the tough guy--but in its way, that just adds to the strength of Josephine's character. A real page-turner, you'll read it in no time flat."
1,Gran is no Chandler,"Dope is written in a faux '50s style that embarrassingly mimics Mickey Spillane. The characters are all losers with no redeeming social value, the plot is a contrived mess, and the ending leaves the reader wondering how the first-person narrator was able to write this novel from her grave. I expected so much more from Sara Gran. She should find a genre that works for her and stick to it."
2,Nothing very new,"Only if you have not recently read Hammett, Chandler and co could you be satisfied with this unpersuasive rehash of the American post-war 'noir' thriller. Gran may love the sassy language of this period, and find echoes of its dark wit, but she brings nothing sufficiently new to the genre to make this exercise worthwhile. Many classic genre novels were actually quite ropy in the plot department, but Gran seems to think this an excuse to follow suit, and hers is thin to a degree that most contempory crime writers would find unacceptable. Being a contemporary novel there is more drugs and more in-your-face nastiness than in noir novels of the past; but all that kind of thing is handled with far more panache and impact by James Ellroy ('LA Confidential', 'The Black Dahlia', 'The Big Nowhere' etc.).I enjoyed Gran's last short novel, 'Come Closer', although that too suffered from a lack of story development, hence its extreme brevity. But this is a step in the wrong direction."
3,Pretty good,"Wasn't the best, but for free I can't really complain all that much. A few tracks that I really liked and a couple I skipped over. But overall, it is a pretty good and relaxing album."
3,Composers,"In case anybody cares, here are the composers for the tracks:1.Canon in D -- Pachelbel2.Air on a G String -- Bach3.Claire de Lune -- Debussy4.Aquarium (misspelled) -- Saint-Saens5.Gymnopedie #1 -- Satie6.Pathetique Sonata II -- Beethoven7.New World Symphony II -- Dvorak8.Nocturne in F -- Chopin9.Fur Elise -- Beethoven10.The Swan -- Saint-Saens11.Goldberg Variations, Aria -- Bach12.Piano Concerto #2 I -- Rachmaninoff13.Recuerdos -- Tarrega14.Song Without Words -- Mendelssohn15.Ave Maria -- Gounod (after Bach)Some of the ID3 tags have the orchestra conductor's name in the composer ID3 field; most of the composer fields are blank.I appreciate all the free albums and tracks from Amazon. I wish they were more careful with ID3 tags.Track 5 seems to have some vinyl surface noise.The price is right. Delete any tracks you don't like. They're mostly old warhorses. If you don't have any classical music in your collection, this isn't a bad start."
4,"Accomplishes its goals, free is also nice!","Downloaded for free through Amazon (still think it's up for grabs for el zilcho). Great selection and nothing hinders it's goal. Pachelbel's canon, Fur Elise, and Ave Maria are the heavy hitters of this album, and have a good supporting cast of other songs for a nice classical mixture. Not a lot of other well known songs in the album, but well worth the price of free!"
3,"mediocre, some songs are hissing and popping","I would expect more for content thats hundred of years old.The selection is questionable, I dont find songs with bad audio recordings in the context of ""relaxing"". There is noticeable hissing and popping on a few of the tracks. I expected better quality."
4,Very Relaxing,"I downloaded this on Amazon because it was free at the time. I personally have not really listened to this, but my parents told me they liked it. So, if my parents like them, it has to be good since they are quite hard to please."
3,Just Too Close To Distortion,"I was hoping for nice, genuine, remixed remastering, but, sadly, not with this CD. Though it does offer some greater detailed sound, it was pushed to its limits, too close to distortion. Spare me the SHM fallacy."
3,"Good Primer, But Not That Memorable","Let's get one thing straight; the Eagles are not the Beatles of the seventies! They weren't great innovators, they didn't invent country rock, and they weren't the most important rock act of the seventies. However, they were a band that drew those folk and country rock influences that were already pioneered by the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Still, Nash (and sometimes Young) into pleasing radio friendly and commercial (if overexposed) hit singles.The Eagles' debut album is a pleasing pastiche of ballads and rockers. There is a slick overall harmonic sound (thanks to Glyn Johns's mixing) that compensates for the lack of memorable melodies and originality. The most memorable tunes here were the ones that became hits: the Jackson Browne rocker `Take It Easy', the airy country ballad `Peaceful Easy Feeling' and the R & B Spinners takeoff `Witchy Woman'.The Eagles' first album may not be their most memorable, but it set the primer for what was to come next."
5,Hard to find but worth the effort!,"I absolutely love this game! [...] My daughter loves farm animals and this game teaches kids how to match the grown animals with their baby animals just by hearing the sounds they make. The baby animals are hidden underneath plastic haystacks which play the hidden animals sound when placed on the stand next to the adult animals (which also emit an adult sound). When a match is made, it plays Old MacDonald much to my daughter's delight! I noticed my daughter also remembered which haystack had which baby animal underneath it based on where she put it back on the board. A really cute game and worth trying to find!"
5,Came quickly in good condition.,Came quickly in good condition. I wanted the old version rather than the electronic version to practice dexterity and I also read the electronic version easily malfunctioned.
5,Old MacDonald's Farm,"I am a Nanny for a family with two preschool children. I also have other children who come to play occasionally. This is one of their favorite games. It holds their attention and it makesthem concentrate on the sound matching of the animals. I would like to buy this game for my two grandchildren, but I can't find it anywhere. Why wouldn't a five star game be more available?"
5,Fun for everyone!,"I love playing this with my little girl, who is three. She loves helping reunite mama animals and babies, and is ecstatic whenever she succeeds! Everytime it plays Old Macdonald had a farm, she runs around the room and dances and then sits back down and plays again. She plays this on her own, and also with her dad and I. This game is educational since she is using her memory and thinking, in addition to concentrating on listening to the animal sounds. She uses some coordination and hand-eye since she has to place the animals right next to their mama's and also learning names of baby animals. I love this game - lots of fun and I'm sure we'll play it in the years to come."
4,It definately was FUN!,My grand-daughter is 3 and we had much FUN layig this game. The Look on her face was priceless when she WON!
4,If your child loves to count,"My 2 year old son has just begun learning to say numbers 1-10, which makes this video perfect for him. He can count along with the visual and audio presentation of numbers 1-10. He also takes time to label the parrots, ducks, fish and other images he recognizes. My five month old, alternatively, was not interested in any part of it. TV isn't his thing just yet. At any rate, this is like a slideshow presentation that allows my 2 year old to practice counting, over and over, amidst images of animals, toys, and actions he alreadys knows about. It gives me a break from counting to ten all day--a nice relief!"
4,Great Addition to Genre,"_Defending Our Dreams_ provides a strong addition to the growing genre of books/anthologies authored by the ""next generation"" of feminists or third wave activists.The book is well-written and includes important discussion about the importance of activism, case studies, discussion about economics, male feminists, and ends with a strong essay about feminist activism in the future. The last entry, a poem, is also provocative and ties up the volume well.I'm using sections from the book in three different courses this term and a few of the student who have already read the sections have shared that they enjoyed the chapters.For my own research purposes, the sections on ICTs and Cyberfeminism were the most useful. The book is written for an academic audience and is probably most useful for undergraduates. That said, I think a lay audience would enjoy the material."
1,Missing Info.....,"I searched and searched for a HEATING PAD...w/o AUTO SHUT off........Low and behold, I thought I had found it here. Well it has auto shut off....wasted money as I now have to go back and search again...I should have read other peoples reviews before buying"
1,do not buy kaz!,"The kaz heating pad I bought was smaller than this one, but it was lousy. It stopped working after 2 weeks. I would never buy anything from them."
2,Not as big as advertized,"The advertizement said this was a 12"" x 22"" heating pad, but when it arrived, it was only 12 X 14. $40.00 is too much for a small heating pad like this. In all fairness, I have not contactd the seller to see if they would make it right."
5,So far works great,"I purchased 2 of these over a month ago. My wife and I both have chronic back pain and use them all the time. Have yet tried the moist heat therapy and probably never will. But, for the price you can't go wrong, Pricing them at local stores I wouldn't have been able to buy one at the price that I got for both of them. shipping was quick, took 6 days from the time I placed the order to the time they we're delivered to my home. Would buy from seller again."
3,Soft Heat heating pad by Kaz,"I don't care for the auto shut-off. The pad does not get hot enough.I run it on high, my last kaz pad would get too hot on high, after a while.The last Kaz heating pad I had came with a sponge to wet.Whatever that thing is you wet, to to get moist heat, I don't like it.I'm still using the old sponge. My last Kaz heating pad worked for years.The thermostat on the new one seems better than on my last heating pad."
4,great for playing and seeing your baby,"great for playing. keeps my baby entertained as she streches her legs to kick the buttons and see the animals pop up. she get's a kick out of it. Also, i'm able to see my baby which is the main purpose for the purchase. my baby having fun was an added in bonus."
2,No worth it,"The idea is cute, but it just doesn't work like it should. My daughter would just kick it from side to side. It should have a better way to keep it secure to the back of the seat so it wouldn't move so much. I returned it and will have to try something else."
1,Not recommended,"I think that this product would be great if it wasn't so poorly made. As soon as I took it out of the box it was broken. I should have returned it right away, however, instead we decided to try it just using the velcro and the thing just does NOT stay in place and even if it was not broken it still wouldn't have worked properly. Definitely over priced and a waste of money.It gets in the way of the infant car seat."
1,Annoying!!!,"This mirror constantly moves when being kicked. Not only that, I have a small car, so I often had to move the mirror toy out of the way, put my son in, then move it back. Very annoying, took it out months ago, would not recommend."
1,Wish it didn't break!,"My 3 month old son loved this toy! However, one of the bunnies stopped jumping within 3 days. I exchanged it for another one which broke in 2 days. How disappointing because he loved kicking them and watching them pop up! If someone could improve on this concept I'd buy it in a minute!"
4,An enjoyable time!,Fun fantasy. The theme of reinventing yourself was timely for me. The characters were likable and the plot moved along well. Will continue to read others in the series.
4,"Slow start, then gets better","This book started off slowly, then got much better towards the middle. If you read the Author's biography, the slow start makes a bit more sense (he was a lawyer before becoming an author).The Kindle edition has a LOT of scanning errors, tons of upside down exclaimation points, words crammed together, and other words torn in two.Now that I've finished this book, I was really disappointed to see the sequel books are not available for the kindle, only the most recent book in the series, which means skipping several chapters. :("
3,good but could have been much better,"There are some very interesting and compelling elements in Magic Kingdom, however, the continuous self-pity exhibited by High Lord Ben for me ultimately kills any positive momentum the author has managed to convey. Ben's fixation on Annie this and Annie that plus his sometimes schizophrenic attitude about fear made it difficult for me to relate to him. As an example of his attitude about fear, he's not afraid to go running or swimming by himself in a strange, unknown land even after being warned of possible dangers, yet in other situations he's positively apoplectic with fear when placed in situations where it is not even clear there is something to be afraid of. Again, parts of the story are very compelling but to me they are weighed down by the protagonist's perpetual self-pity and inconsistent personality characteristics."
4,Rather pleased,"I did enjoy reading the Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold. I am a long time fan of Brooks. It has been YEARS since I read his books and was very excited for a reintroduction. The e-book version had many errors in it (using 1's in place of I's and weird placed, upside down ! where maybe a .(period) was needed and a few other weird typos). But hey, I got it free and will look for the next installment."
3,A king without a kingdom?,"This is definitely not your typical fantasy novel. While others have written stories about people from our world/universe taveling to alternates where magic functions, few place the protagonist in the throne of a land that refuses to recongize his rule. Ben Holiday finds himself in just this situation, and struggles mightily to find away to legitimize his reign. That he will ultimately succeed seems obvious, but the journey provides an interesting character study, as Holiday must face his demons and learn to control his fears. The other characters are quirky and often amusing, and this book is a pleasant read, but not quite good enough to motivate me to go out and hunt for the rest of the series."
4,Just plain and simple fun,"Ben Holiday, a successful lawyer and recent widower purchases a magic kingdom out of an exclusive catalog for a million dollars.A great fantasy done by one of the best. A fun and action packed adventure that is refreshingly unpretentious. What makes this work is that the book never tries to be more than what it is. There is no deep rooted symbolism or abstract concepts to be found here. Just a cast of great semi-quirky caracters in a book with a unique charm. Those who like their fantasy in an epic scale look elsewhere. All others enjoy!"
5,Fun Present day fantasy,"I was pleasantly surprised when I found this book. It didn't look like much, but the story is fantastic. It pulls a normal modern day person into a wonderful fantasy land, complete with annoyances and it's own economic problems. The characters are very likeable and it's a very fun read."
5,Great Book! Really Enjoyable!!,"This book was great, really humorous. I loved the combination of the real world of Earth and the fantasy world of Landover. I also realy enjoyed the characters like the smart ones with no commonsence that really made me laugh every time I read about them. This book also had some good and original villians. This is a must read. Good job Terry, you've really outdone yourself."
5,"A hilarious, fun blend of mystery and fantasy.","Audio narrator Dick Hill has had vast experience narrating gripping stories, which is one of the selling points to the audio version of Book One in the 'magic Kingdom of Landover' series, MAGIC KINGDOM FOR SALE - SOLD!. Landover is a real magic kingdom purchased by Ben, who finds only after his acquisition that the kingdom is in ruin. There's even an evil witch and a dragon wrecking havoc on his new purchase. Add in the contested rights to his assuming the position of King and you have a hilarious, fun blend of mystery and fantasy.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Unexpected Fun,I was surprised that the main character stayed after realizing what a difficult world he'd entered. Rarely am I invested in a character so quickly. I was proud of his decisions and happy with the results.
5,A great place for Attorneys!,"An interesting fantasy. Just what one Ben Holiday Attorney at Law needed but didn't really expect. Only a trick is what he was thinking first. Once reaching believability at one level all the rest seemed just as believable.There were a few slow downs in the plot, though wading through the adventure it did become more exciting to imagine being with this odd group. There was plenty of danger and surprises too.I gave a 5 rating because I simply enjoyed the story and wanted to discover the final outcome from every point of the tale of Ben Holidays trip to a challenging new life."
4,I have read 22 books by Terry Brooks.,"I have read 22 books by Terry Brooks. I'm new to the Landover Series. I found the first 1/2 of the book a very slow introduction to this series, but in all fairness, the book picked up after halfway (A little patience from me was well worth it). Book #2, The Black Unicorn, was much better, and I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars. I'm now reading #3 (Wizard at Large). I have been wanting to read this series because of the soon to be released, ""A Princess of Landover"" (Scheduled release on Aug. 18, 2009).Even if this series isn't the same quality as the ""Shannara"" series (prequels and sequels), I'd rather read Terry Brooks than many other authors out there. I look forward to anything he writes (I even have some books on audio as well as paper/hardback). Terry, keep up the good work! You bring us all many hours of enjoyment."
5,First Terry Brooks Book I ever read,"Way back when I first started into fantasy, this one caught my eye. To buy a Kingdom was a cool idea. Of course at the time they don't explain all the 'bad' things which go with it and that you have to leave this world. LOved it.Exceptional fantasy storytelling.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
4,Weird and wonderful!,"Terry Brooks opens his imagination to a boundless world: Landover. This book is a must read for Brooks' fans! This book is inspiring, funny, action-packed, and (above all), just plain EXCITING!"
2,Very boring for the most part.,I found this book very boring. Especially in the beggining. It gets a little better towards the end. Most of the book just seemed to drag.
2,"Characters are similar to TV show ""2 1/2 Men""","I think fans of the show ""2 1/2 men"" will like this book - but it is not a comedy."
1,Put him out of his misery -- and mine,"The ""hero"" of this novel spends the first three chapters wallowing in self-pity. I didn't read chapter 4; I was afraid Brooks was going to let the guy live."
2,Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold!,This book was very boring! It does not even come close to comparing with his others.
4,Enjoyable nostalgia,"I read this when it first came out and loved it. I didn't know who Terry Brooks was and I picked it up because I liked the cute dog on the cover. I recently purchased for my 13 year old daughter, thinking she'd like it as much as I did. She didn't. After she gave up about 15 pages in (""I just don't think it's very well written"") I picked it up and wound up reading it all by the next evening. Part of it may have been nostalgia for my teenage self, but I really enjoyed this book. The start was a bit slow and my daughter is right -- the writing is not always the greatest -- but once the protagonist gets to Landover (and meets the still-cute talking dog), the pace is quite quick."
5,A great read!,"I picked this book up because I was intrigued by the title -- and I ended up reading the whole series! This book is a rarity among fantasy books: an extremely original plot, interesting and bizarre (but sophisticated) characters, plenty of humor and excitement. I was glad to see that the main focus of the story actually was the plot, and that it didn't get lost in the genre. For this reason it will appeal to a wide range of people, even those who don't normally like fantasy. Give it a read! You won't regret it."
4,Great Book,"Overall a great book. Definitely not the best by Terry Brooks, but thoroughly enjoyable none the less. I've re-read it several times (as I have most of my books) and each time that I read it, I STILL enjoy it... and that's what makes a book a good book. The storyline is interesting, the characters unique. I'd recommend reading al the books in the series to fully enjoy the complete story"
2,I wanted to like this book,"I wanted to like this book. It has an interesting premise, it is by a great writer, and I am really into fantasy and sci fi. I kept expecting the book to get better but it never did. The humor needs much improvement, the story line is very predictable, and the ending was just as dull as the whole. Just about the only thing I liked about this book was the price--free.I was very surprised that I did not like the book. It got good reviews and it is a subject that I enjoy."
2,"Passes the time, but unimpressive","I really want to like this story, but there's a lot to be desired within the pages of Magic Kingdom. The main character is really the only character - we get more insight into the personality of a dragon than from our hero's love interest, for example.There is very little of note in Landover - even though Ben, our main character, signed up for the stereotypical fantasy land, there needs to be something creative or new about it to make it worthwhile for the rest of us to read. It's cute - and nothing more.That actually sums up most of Magic Kingdom - cute, but little beneath the surface."
3,Kindle version,"Enjoyable bubblegum(brain candy as opposed to brain food book) fantasy...brooks tells a good story, and free is an excellent price. The problem with the kindle version is that there are a fair number of typos and scanning errors that pop up throughout the book. I wish that the publishers thought this sort of thing through, because a well-formatted freebie would certainly sell more Terry Brooks books in the future than an error-riddled one. I'd like to have more Terry Brooks, but I think I will be viewing samples before I purchase them."
4,The best Terry Brooks book I have read,Really a charming tale here. Terry wrote a likeable book with entertaining characters. Its lighthearted and fun. You can spend some time wandering in this kingdom and forget the world and just enjoy it.
5,Once A Good Read,"Still a good read. I read this several years back, but it's still a fantastic book to settle down with and enjoy."
2,"Great Idea, bad execution","I bought this book because I really liked the concept of buying a magic kingdom. This kingdom, however, didn't seem very magic to me, but rather full of fantasy cliches. Also, nothing much happens anywhere unless the lawyer-turned-king actually goes there. It appeared to me that the whole kingdom is frozen and only parts of it come to life as our hero appears there. Finally, the whole plot is very predictable.On the up side, brooks has a few funny ideas and knows how to make one turn the pages, hence two stars.With so many good fantasy books left for me to read, after the experience of this book I am glad I don't have to look at Brook's work any more."
1,Great Book - Awful Kindle Version,"This is one of my favorite fantasy series. Unfortunately, the Kindle digital version is really badly converted. A good amount of the punctuation is completely wrong, and many of the words are garbled. You can still make out what's going on, but the number of typos is really embarrassing. You get what you pay for, since it's a free digital download, but still, I'm not going to buy any other of the books in this series digitally.It's a great series, and I'd highly recommend buying the books, but avoid the Kindle version unless they fix it."
4,You never know what's going to happen next,"At frist a angry unhappy lawer in the real world who always feels sorry for himself,next thing you know he's king of a magical land.This novel is the best book I've ever read, it makes you think their must something more out there than the world we know of.READ THIS BOOK"
3,Wonderful Escape from Reality!,This book is a wonderful fantasy and is great for anyone who is looking for a break. The book begins in our present day world but soon you find yourself reading a fairytale. Very well written and exciting. A great plus is that it is clean enough that you could let your teenager read it and not worry an ounce. Terry Brooks is a great author and I love everything he has written.(So do my teenage and college age boys.) You won't be sorry you read this!!
1,Put me to sleep,"I got a bit over halfway through this and I tried, I really, really tried but wow this is boring! Nothing happens at all in the first 200 pages aside from him buying the kingdom. I thought there would be much more fantasy in this book and fun fantasy creatures but you only really hear about them more in passing then anything else. I was also looking forward to the funny parts of this book but I must have missed them because I did not find any part even enough to crack a smile for. I actually had to do something else while reading to keep myself from dozing off so I figured it was time to quit this one."
4,Great Book,I have read the book before and decided to re-read it again this time on my kindle.It's a great story
5,My favorite book of all time,"What a great book!!! I have read all of the books in this series and loved them all. I first read these books as a teen after my mother gave me the book in an attempt to spark my interest in reading, it worked. I have re read them again just recently, and will now give the books to my daughter to read. I could not put these books down, could not wait to get the next book in the series and was sad when there were no more books in the series. I wish he had written as many books in this series as he did in the Shannara series."
3,"I love Brooks books but, Landover isn't his best work","This is just slow and meant to be read at a leisurely pace. If you like books that are to the point with some good action scenes and whatnot, check out Brooks' shannara series. But this, however, well... it has an emotional enough ending that saved the whole book. Being frank and to the point, this is list of some things that was wrong with it: constant swearing which is unusual for Brooks, a slow pace, takes forever to get to the point, we ALWAYS need to know what brand of shoes Ben Holiday is wearing and what brand of cereal he's eating (Ben Holiday put on his Nikes and ate some Raisin Bran), a tad boring in places where you force yourself to read, people who turn into trees, overload on quirky characters, some unrealistic emotions, but aside from all that, it did have a good ending. And, on the plus side, it REALLY helped me fall asleep."
5,Pam Anderson,What can I say. Pam is gorgeous and this will be a cherished piece of my collection for a long time.
4,Earmarked for enjoyment,"What are the limits of your compassion? Listen to an alleged madman who has a penchant for prostitute's ears rave about the culture that locked him up.There can be no doubt that the author has an ear for the nuances of intelligent, colorful conversation. This is a book for the sophisticated reader who isn't frightened of being a fence-sitter in the realm of moral matters! Minus one star for trailing off at the end."
2,"Thankfully short, ridiculous novel.","Reading sleeping with ""Jane Austen"" left a bad taste in my mouth. The narrative was awful, I loathed the main character and found him repulsive and wonder if there really is such a creature so pathetic. Aitken also peppered this 200 page excuse for a novel with highly erudite words that hardly anybody uses, let alone a depraved serial killer with an ear fetish. It's not the worst(That's Kathy Acker's ""pirate"" book), but it comes pretty close."
5,Outstanding book!,"The previous edition of ""New Directions in Solid State Chemistry"" has been my favorite book in our University Library. If you deal with Solid State Chemistry, Inorganic Materials Science or Ceramics you should read this book and keep it on your desk. Then you should read it continuously like a Bible.It covers a lot of topics on materials synthesis, structures and characterization. One certainly can not keep in mind all compounds and experimental data presented in this book, however it is extremely exciting to find that authors forced you to discover a logic hidden in the huge volume of reviewed experimental facts and later to use this discovery in your own research.Once I found a new edition of this book at Amazon.com, I ordered it without hesitating a second.The only problem - it takes long time to process this order."
1,Elton at his worst,"Gridlock is a poor cover for Ben Elton to expound his politically-correct views on the world again. It's a shame, because Elton has a fine sense of humor and the basic premise of the story's not that bad. Unfortunately, the whole sorry scenario is spoiled right from page one with Elton truisms.Why can't Elton stick to what he knows best - making people laugh?"
4,Funny at first...,"Don't get me wrong, I found this book funny the whole way through, but by the time I had reached the end I was beginning to become aware of a handful of serious issues that Elton raises. For example, having a protagonist who is a c.p sufferer to demonstrate the way cars are beginning to disable us all; 'Gridlock is when a city dies'. He comments on various aspects of society, usually taking a small chapter away from the plot to do so. The film-like rapid change of scenes with the 'goodies' and the 'baddies' makes you wonder how long it'll be until someone buys the rights, yet at the same time, there is no way they could possibly show the deep analysis of humanity that Elton displays. This novel is a brilliant dip-in dip-out tale that can be read on two levels. The humour is perceptive and effective to the story. Please read it!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A dead city doesn't move.This book is certainly not in the class of Stark, unfortunately. Maybe due to the somewhat narrower focus, and some similarities to the previous effort.Again, industrial pollution is an element as a city that becomes full of cars as has no functional transport methods dies.Those doing well out of this of course want to keep the status quo and bump off people trying to do something about it."
5,Clever and Funny,"Very well written, much like some of the old audio / stand up, Ben is cutting, sharp, emotive, and provocative. The plot is probably a bit too close to the truth for the oil barons of this world, and the political aspect may well be the same. At times i was laughing out loud, at others i sat and thought ponderously, a good mix from any book. Read and enjoy."
4,Funny and thoughtful,"It was a really clever book, and fun read. If you like the kind of book with laugh-out-loud humor and good commentary, you'll like this one."
5,WOMENS FLEECE VEST,"GOT THIS FOR MY MOM.SHE LOVES IT.TRUE TO SIZE, FAST DELIVERY AND ON SALE TOO. VERY HAPPY.THANK YOU"
5,love this vest!,"I have one word for this vest...comfy! It seems to keep you warm when you need it, but not too warm when you don't. Love the Beet color too."
3,Columbia Vest,This vest is really nice. The color is nice. It fits well and is warm.It is well made also.
5,Nice and warm!,"I bought this vest because I had seen them at a local sporting good store. Unfortunately they didn't have the color I wanted and I found that on Amazon. This is a very nice vest. It is warm, has great pockets, zips up the front. It is made from a very nice quality polar fleece. I am very happy with it."
4,Golf Vests from Columbia,"I like the vests, but the material is a little bit too lightweight.They have to be treated carefully when putting tees, divot tools,golf balls, etc. in the pockets."
3,"Quality looked good, sizing was large","I ended up returning this item because it was too big. The quality looked acceptable, but the sizes seem to run large and the result is a really baggy, drafty vest if you're not careful. I'd suggest ordering a size down."
5,True Genius,"I ordered this small gem on a whim. The idea of having to open a book with a key, allowing the reader to interact with the story from the beginning, caught my attention. Okay, I'll buy and try, I thought. Well, when I received it, opened it with one of the two keys that came along, and began reading, I was hooked. The Vampire Diary is exactly that... a diary! The pages are all ""handwritten"" jottings, notes, screams, and drawings. I could not put it down until I finished it. The length is short, immensely readable, and immensurably mesmerizing. Absolute genius, and 10x worth the price."
2,Leave Clover,"The first single out of three for the ""No Leaf Clover"" song from the S&M album.The song is an old b-side of Metallica, you can also find it in some rare demos as well.The song is pretty cool, but ain't nothing special to write about... The two extra features (video & document) on this single can also be found in the S&M DVD, so if you are looking for rare Metallica's b-sides or live material - this one ain't got it!"
2,Leave Clover,"The third single out of three for the ""No Leaf Clover"" song from the S&M album.The song is an old b-side of Metallica, you can also find it in some rare demos as well.The song is pretty cool, but ain't nothing special to write about... The two extra features (screen saver & document) on this single ain't that great, the document can also be found in the S&M DVD, so if you are looking for rare Metallica's b-sides or live material - this one ain't got it!"
2,Leave Clover,"The second single out of three for the ""No Leaf Clover"" song from the S&M album.The song is an old b-side of Metallica, you can also find it in some rare demos as well.The song is pretty cool, but ain't nothing special to write about... The two extra features (photo gallery & document) on this single can also be found in the S&M DVD, so if you are looking for rare Metallica's b-sides or live material - this one ain't got it!"
3,"Tough read, but worth it","I'm not a psychology major-I'm sure I would get more out of the book if I was, but I am very interested in the relationship of the human psyche to nature. Some of the essays are easier to read than others,"
3,Earth Pink Shoes,"The sole is too heavy for the style of shoe. They are a bit too wide for a medium width. I love the look of them and the pink color is terrific, but they are heavy to walk in."
4,Bubble gum shoes,"These shoes are comfortable enough, if a little stiff. I do like the color--I get mixed reactions and I don't really care. They were a decent price."
5,Clucky but cute.,True to size and width. The pink takes getting used to. I just wear them around the house. I only get teased by my family.
2,I'd skip this one,"The instructions were complex, but not too cumbersome. Getting through the game took about 10 minutes and was not terribly interesting or fun. A big problem we had was that it had to really be dark to see the difference between the night and day markings. Then we couldn't see the dice. In all fairness we played it through only once, and after reading the other reviews we'll try again. But, I really don't think we're missing anything crucial. Maybe it's a matter of preference, but we're pretty easily amused, and this one just didn't do it."
4,FM Wall scroll,"Very nice wall scroll. Large. Covers up lots of holes (ha, ha). Very well made and came packed to prevent damage."
2,For what this cost; I expected something good.,"This was a real disappointment. There are three short indoor rowing sessions where one guy has his head cocked to the side the whole time & another looks like he is in pain. It's not from hard work because these guys are not rowing fast or heavy. The third guy had much better form. The second DVD is for strength but they neglect to mention you need gym equipment to do it. If your looking for a good rowing dvd, try the 7 Indoor Rowing Workouts by Xeno Muller. I wish I could get my money back on The Rower."
2,The mystery of the missing editor.,"There is no denying that Patricia Highmsith was one of the great suspence writers of the past century. However, not everything that glitters is gold.The easiest way to describe Highsmith's final novel ""Small g: A Summer Idyll"" is to say it's a 150 page story trapped in a 300 page book. Having said that, I must admit that this novel is not without virtues: actually, the story is quite strong, the characters are an endearing assortment of straights and gays tangled up in a pseudo-mystery, the scenario is not uninteresting (it could make a first rate film - Rupert Everett would be great as Ricky) - which is why I pushed myself to finish. Unfortunately for readers, the physical writing is so stodgy that many may give up the struggle long before the mystery is solved. But DON'T give up. This book is well worth reading."
2,Small g,"Not sure I'll ever finish this book -- it's set aside just now. Agonizingly slqw in getting under way, repititious, rather dull characters. little action. Rick is no Ripley."
1,Warriors of The RAINBOW,"This movie came to me stopping almost half way through it.It is a very good movie as far as the movie goes.And the part of it that I was able to watch I know I want it for myself .But because of it stopping and after loosing around 15 min of the movie,by moving it foward, I talked with the shipper about it and they said that if I shipped it back to them they would ship me another one.When I asked them if they would send me a return slip they told me no I was to ship it back myself.I am still waiting for a answer as to what is going to happen."
4,Warriors of the Rainbow - Seediq Bale,"An exceptional movie which promted me to research and read more about the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan. There are three other earlier movies from Taiwan, 'Finding Sayun,' 'The Sage Hunter' and 'Waiting for the Flying Fish.' It would be great if these were available from Amazon."
5,Sherlock Holmes meets Count Dracula,"Scarlet In Gaslight tells the story of SHerlock Holmes meeting Count Dracula in Victorian London.This is the 25th anniversary edition the Eisner nominated series originally released by Eternity Comics in 1986. Written by Martin Powell and artwork by Seppo Makinen,Scarlet tells the story of Holmes meeting Dracula which rattles him beasuse he doesn't believe that suppernatural forces exist.Professor Morarity brings Count Dracula(who he thinks he can control) to fianlly rid himself of Sherlock Holmes.Thios was first introduction to Sherlock Holmes and Powell certainly has made me a fan of Holmes. Makine's artwork vividly brings Victorian London to life in gritty black and white. Pulp 2.0 Press released this edition."
3,Lovely music of J.N.Hummel as ever.,"Very interesting experience. All works played on very, very old instruments - they have been made when J.N.Hummel was still alive!!! Not a piece of CD for audiophile-freaks - since the instruments are old, you can hear the sound of piano not exactly the way as we used to hear nowadays when modern instruments are mostly in use. But, for Hummel lovers it is a wonderful piece to complete the collection."
5,Best Multisurface Polish on the Market,"I have been using Flitz for 10yrs now and I have yet to find a surface it does not work on. I originally bought Flitz to polish surface scratches out of my Japanese Swords, but I quickly found that it worked wonders on my handguns and rifles as well. I have tried other metal poishes in the past like Metalglo, but Flitz is a superior product. I perfer the Flitz paste, because its a little thicker and seems more concentrated, and it is easier to manage your dispersion."
2,"For bathtub, only so-so. Would not buy again for that use.","Tried this about a week ago for the first time on a dingy bathtub. It worked OK on little rust stain around the bathtub fixtures but not perfectly. Seemed to do nothing for the overall grayness of the tub, though I used the whole tube in one swoop. (Ultimately, I solved the problem with some Zap! restorer/cleaner.) One plus to the product is that it seems nontoxic and relatively mild. May be a fine product for other uses, but for my needs, it was, overall, a waste of money."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected this book to contain works by poets just coming into public recognition, like Jack Myers book New American Poets of the 90s. Instead, I found an anthology of prominent poets of today--very worthwhile, but containing the same poets available in most any comtemporary anthology. A nice addition to my bookshelf but with little new to be discovered."
4,This book help me finish my Ph. D. disseration in Taiwan,"Firstly, I would like to say thanks to the authors, I am an experimentalist who was lack of the theoretical training, I read the book by self-studying. The style of this book inherit the book ¡Laser physics¡ (by Sargent, Scully, Lamb), which is also my favorite. Especially, in the new editing, Meystre update new topics in the field of modern quantum optics (such as cavity QED) which I think also very good for self-study. However, the new typesetting of the book makes me somehow uncomfortable since the spacing of the lines is too compact. I would appreciate the editing/typesetting of the second editing."
5,Great old classic!,"I first heard this album when visiting north Carolina with my folks on a college tour. I couldn't get over the way the album sounded almost mystic. You can tell it was one of Johns first recordings, the crackle of the mic, the bass in the drums, everything has a great 'vintage' sound. In 'he's coming back' John sings, ""one of these old days, I'm going away to see the Lord, my savior God and my friend,"" the lyrics and the passion in which John sings always amazes me. Even Tina in the back screaming ""sing John...play"" added to the authenticity..I truly enjoy this album. My favorites are: he's coming back, I worship thee, and yes lord."
4,Books for newbie on internet marketing and insights.,"Overall this is a very interesting book on internet marketing,enjoy reading especially on certain chapter which give me some valuable information on ebook publishing and affiliate.Having few of the top marketer sharing their insight on the topic builds up my confident to be in business online."
2,Nothing special,"Didn't like the book and have not used any info that I got from them, loss on the money I spent"
4,e-Code changes and still stays the same,"I bought this book when it was first released a few years ago which now seems like decades.Re-reading it recently, it is interesting to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same.The strategies used in this book are still being used today, some with a different twist. But still enlightening, and shows that you approach it properly and with the right plan. Making money online is still a very viable option.The key is the use of a vivid imagination and making the right choices.Top Ten Power Principles Of Success"
5,It Works,"This is an excellent book. I followed only a few of the tips that Joe gave, and instantly got connected with my niche market. I have so many followers I needed help just replying to the emails."
1,waste of time and money,"this is a waste of time and money. Just telling people to SPAM, and some how-to-spam tips is not worth wading thru the extended sales pitches for Vitale's other products."
4,Practical Guidelines for Internet Businesses,"This book contains a lot of useful content about Internet marketing techniques and the difficult area of Internet business planning. It destroys the idea that Internet businesses are simple quick start, rags-to-riches concepts. Instead, it's about good planning and hard and smart work.DM(...)"
1,Disappointing,"Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader)."
