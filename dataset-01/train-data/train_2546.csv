1,No good for beginners or (1st year) students,"I am a 1st year student at a computer science & management study in the Netherlands where they chose this book to teach us how to program Java. I'm not the only one who doesn't agree with their choice. It is unstructured, giving you assignments at the end of each chapter without enough explanations on how to do the things they ask. They base their explanations on just one example and give unclear overviews of the structure of java. A week after starting the course I went straight to the bookstore for a better book (Java: How to program, Deitel & Deitel)"
1,Over Simplification will do no java beginner any justice,"This book was a horrible guide to learning JAVA. It is riddler with errors, both English and logic. For a book that makes an attempt for simplicity by using such methods as SimpleIO and SimpleGUI, it will really set a bad seed to a beginning programmer. There are far better books on the market that will offer the user a lot less confusion."
1,Terrible book for learning Java,"This book is probably the worst choice for teaching someone new to programming. My copy is a tattered shred from being thrown across the rooms on numerous occasions. Now that I have been programming for a couple of years, some of their explanations still seem complicated. Here is one example of many: ""programmers say that void methods are executed for their effect..."" An experienced programmer will understand it, but if you are new to programming this is probably the worst explanation ever. The writers probably tried to be as technically accurate and concise as possible, and it makes sense to someone who already knows the material, but this book caused me a lot of aggravation."
4,The one of easiest Structure & Algorithm book I ever read.,"The one of easiest Structure & Algorithm book I ever read. It shows you how to build basic programming structure such as Binary tree, Linked list, and others. Also, it covers various aspect of Java programming; Object oriented design, GUI user interface, and Software development method.However, it lacks the detail description of Java language, so I recommend you to have other Java programming reference guide.It was very easy to read; even for me (non-native English speaker). Since I knew other object oriented programming, I was able to finish the book within 4 days. My favorite part is chapter 11 (Recursion)."
1,Cynical Marketing,"The rich lore of Lord of the Rings trilogy is ideal material for fun and challenging games, as the many excellent game adaptations of the Middle Earth world and the Lord of the Rings story prove: most notably the rich and subtle cooperative game by Reiner Knizia (one of the best games available on any topic; ASIN: B00005O0F4) and the much simpler but still quite deep 2-player Stratego-like 'Confrontation' game (also by Reiner Knizia; ASIN: B00006JBPP), both of which, in addition to being excellent games in their own right, are also superbly 'themed': the Lord of the Rings feel and atmosphere comes through during play and one really feels involved in an adventure in Middle Earth. (The 'children's game', again by Knizia, is also worth a look for kids under 8.)But monopoly? Mt. Doom as real estate? This is just ""theming"" to make a buck. Monopoly collectors will probably love this game, but if you want a Lord of the Rings game try some of those just mentioned instead."
2,Cheap playing pieces!!,"Although we love Lord of the Rings and thought it would be fun having a Monopoly version, we were very disappointed at the quality of this game. The playing pieces were extremely cheap, as was the board itself, more like cardboard with paper on it. We hate it!!"
5,Educational value,"Monopoly is a great way for kids to learn about money (counting money, giving change, buying, and selling). This edition is of particularly high interest to middle school and junior school aged children. This would make a great gift for any student who loves the Lord of the Rings and is struggling in math."
5,Another great version of Monopoly,"For a person like me who is a Lord of the Rings fan and a Monopoly fan, this is a great game. The rules are the same, so it isn't difficult to play. It also has the great variation with the ring, which serves two purposes to me. 1. It creates a fun twist and 2. It is a gauge of how long the game will go. Monopoly is notorious for lasting for an eternity. A must for all Lord of the Rings and Monopoly lovers."
2,Not one of Seton's better efforts...,"I absolutely loved Anya Seton's ""The Winthrop Woman,"" so I had high hopes for this novel, which takes place in 19th century Marblehead, MA. Today, Marblehead is a wealthy Boston suburb, but in former days it was a gritty fishing village.Alas, ""The Hearth and Eagle"" was a pretty blah book. For some reason, Hesper never really seemed to come alive for me; her character seemed just sort of strange and annoying. I was much more drawn in by the flashback to her 17th century ancestors, who were among Marblehead's first colonists. Seton would have done better to simply write their story instead."
2,Seton has done better (try 'Katherine'),"Hesper Honeywood's family has lived in Marblehead and run the Hearth and Eagle pub ever since the town's founding around the 1630s, and she has grown up listening to her father extol the family's rich history. Now, at the inception of the Civil War, her simple life is about to change when a local wise woman tells her future for a few coppers: She will have three men in her life, but she will know nothing but heartbreak.This is definitely not one of Seton's best works. Frankly, I didn't buy into Hester's relationships given the reader's introduction to her personality in initial chapters - especially with Porterman, whose relationship is particularly disturbing with nothing leading up to their marriage (they are just suddenly together). Seton is talented, but this book was not satisfying."
3,Doesn't even come close to Blacklisted,"Blacklisted is in a league of it's own. If you like the more twangy country sound that Neko had on her first few cd's, the you might like this. I prefer the darker, haunting, sometimes jazzy sound on Blacklisted, and this just doesn't do a whole lot for me."
5,Oh Yeah!,"Somewhere there is a Hollywood director who will one day use a Neko Case song in some movie that will forever tie her into our minds. Until that day, we will have to content ourselves with albums such as her latest release. ""Fox Confessor Brings the Flood"" continues the string of quality recordings from this truly gifted vocalist. While bringing considerable charm to The New Pornographers, it on her solo albums that Neko Case's soaring voice can reach its true heights. The feud between ""Margaret vs. Pauline"" opens the disc to a solid beginning while songs like the title track, ""Star Witness,"" and the traditional ""John Saw That Number"" maintain the momentum through to the exquisite ""The Needle has Landed."" While one could claim a sameness to much of the other material, I view it as a musical consistency that makes this album Neko Case's finest."
4,Alt.country chanteuse goes pop-ish,Less Cline and more Dusty Springfield and a little Joni Mitchell. There is no voice like Cases in music today and she stands with a select few with the pipes and the courage to do unique and enduring music instead of just phoning it in and cashing a check.
4,Please enter a title for your stupid comments,"...well, I don't know if it's stupid, but this was a very nice, easy listening album from beginning to end. No real stand-out tracks that I could ever see radio playing, but I felt she saved her best song for last, The Needle Has Landed. Other stand-out tracks IMO are Star Witness and Hold On, Hold On.Word. Now do the right thing and say that my review was helpful so that I feel worthy of myself. Thanks, and god bless."
4,Haunting,"Makes me wanna put on a faded dress, sit in a rocking chair on the front porch barefoot and listen to the coyotes howl across the prairie."
4,Fox Confessor Brings The Flood,"As always, a couple of cuts I could live without. Overall, a very enjoyable CD, with ""Hold On"" being outstanding. Great new artist with room to grow."
2,electronic noise,"I first heard Neko Case on a 'folk' station. I purchased this, Fox Confessor' album. It is so electronically modified, it reminds me of some old '60's stuff. The reverb is very over done. I won't by another of her works."
5,One of my favorite albums from the past few years....,"This is one album I keep coming back to. It has a nostalgic, comforting feel to it even when it's at it most macabre. I love the American gothic feel and her voice just does it for me."
4,"A slow grower, but it wins the listener over in the end","I found myself initially disappointed with Fox Confessor, and I haven't quite grasped why. Case has made a fan of me with her Loretta Lynne/Patsy Cline vocals set in modern alt-country surroundings, but this album threw me at first. Perhaps, being swept up in the thrill of finding Case with Blacklisted and The Tigers Have Spoken, it was impossible for her follow-up to surprise me. Fox Confessor ended up being a sleeper for me - I bought it, listened repeatedly, and didn't find it evoking a deep love that her previous albums had, and it wound up sadly shelved and ignored. But then it slowly started working its magic on me, first by snagging me with the hooks of ""Star Witness"" and its lilting, soaring melody, and then uncovering genuine perfect pop songs sprinkled all throughout the album - they're just more subtle than her previous albums would have you prepared for. This was a very strong contender for that number 1 spot by the end of the year."
3,A small disappointment.,"I have been a big Neko Case fan for a while and was excited about her latest. Unfortunately, I found it lacking in the intimacy and depth of her previous works. Hopefully her next will be better."
3,Doesn't live up to billing,"I heard ""Hold On, Hold On"" and read the rave reviews, so I got it. Unfortunately, I discovered the reviews are unwarranted.Yes, she has an incredible voice, but her caterwauling on some of the cuts is just too much. The instrumentalists are adept, but they can't make up for the mediocre songwriting.Take the obscure lyrics. Perhaps they resonate with the songwriter, but they do nothing for me. Instead of coming off as mysterious or enigmatic, they simply fail to connect on any level.Then there are the tunes. At best they are forgettable, at worst, supremely annoying.Perhaps ""Hold On"" is worth buying the CD for. If not, I would recommend carefully listening to all the snippets before making your decision."
2,Vastly over-rated.,"This recording left me cold. Case has a competent, albeit unmemorable voice. I wondered whether it was just this recording and listened to her Austin City Limits recordings as well. It too seems short on passion and far too stylized on such classics as Wayfaring Stranger. Compare Case's version to versions by Emmylou Harris or Mandy Barnett to see the real power in this song and real pipes. Case's vocals are far too clipped. The best female ""country music"" recording of 2006 is neither Case nor the Dixie Chicks but rather Rosanne Cash's Black Cadillac."
2,Not so much...,"Seems with Neko, either you love her or ... not so much. A little on the shrill side for some, but obviously we're in the minority. Just fair warning - don't buy this just because it's number one. Buy it because you've listened to the samples and decided this is a voice you can hear over and over without once being reminded of nails on a blackboard. Enjoy."
2,Polar Opposite of New Pornographers,Don't buy this if you are a fan of the New Pornographers and that is why you like Neko Case. This couldn't have any more difference in sound. Sometimes that's not a bad thing but this time I'm afraid it is. I'm throwing my lot in with Nomenclature below. I really wanted to like this. I tend to like the things that critics says are great. I like offbeat things. But...I didn't like this. It really doesn't have anything catchy or memorable in it. I wouldn't listen to it again. I guess people like it maybe because it isn't catchy? I'm just not sure. Just please listen to the clips first and see if you like what you hear.
2,Big let-down,"Really, skip this one and buy all your friends a copy of ""Blacklisted."" If they already have one, get another.You come for the voice, but you stay for the songs - and the songs just are not there this time out. This has been getting rave reviews (I guess the press has finally woken up) but this pales next to ""Blacklisted,"" which is a masterpiece."
3,Great voice and band but what does it mean?,I am a long time lover of Neko's so it pains me to give her only 3 stars.Her voice has only gotten richer and the band rocks but what is she singing about?There are a few songs that we the listener can relate to and sing along with but the majority are lacking a melody or hook.This album is way to pretentious for me!
2,"Great voice, but what the heck is she singing about?","Sure her voice is haunting and sure one can tell there is obvious genius here, but what the heck is she singing about?! I want something I can relate to, and it seems to be a bit of a downer, kind of depressing and wierd. Wierd? Yes, in the way that it is so esoteric. Nothing bothers me more than an esoteric artist."
3,"Strong atmosphere and action, weak characters","This book started well but soon spiraled into an action adventure before I cared about anybody in the story. To be sure, Odom can write very well. He casts a spell with his gloomy setting and evocative descriptions. Cinematic action. But this matters little when the reader has no one to identify with. And there is little if any humor throughout. Very serious dark creature story."
2,senior reader,"just having read the rover series i was delighted to see he had another book of adventure. feeling sure i would like it i purchased the book. must to my disgust it was so graphic i had to give the book to the resale store just to remove it from my home. i have read many adventure books with violence in them but this was just too much. page after page of it. so be warned by a person who didn't get past the first few chapters that blood, gore and horror or constant in this book. look it up at your library and scan it close before you get it, let alone go buy it. watch this will be the next horror movie for kids-- bet ya."
1,A problem with research?,"Not literature at all, besides to the strange pleasure the author seems to have regarding gore. In spite of this, I did enjoy the detailed information concerning the business of whaling in those days. Still, I believe that Mr Odom failed in his historical research: the story is supposed to happen in 1813, and every time Mr Odom mentions Easter Island he adds ""Chile"" -implying that the island was a Chilean possession in those days-, however, it happens that Easter Island (Rapa Nui) only became part of the Chilean territory in 1888, this is 75 years after the time of the story! Moreover, in 1813 Chile didn't even exist as a nation: it was a Spanish colony fighting for it's independence, which was only officially declared on February 12, 1818."
4,Captive Marine Aquarium,"This is a beautifully illustrated book. Mr. Shang doesn't need credentials for this work. You only need to look at the tank's themselves to see how experienced and knowledgeable about his subject. This is a must-have companion piece to Paletta's Ultimate Marine Aquarium, which contains one of Shang's tanks."
2,Not A Resource Book,"This book is definetly not intended to provide any information on keeping captive marine aquariums. There is little technical information and what information is provided is overly simplistic. While the author maybe talented at marine fish keeping based on the photographs in the book, he does not share any philosophies or techniques. Yes, there are nice pictures of the authors aquariums and this could provide inspiration to begining aquarists but for the intermediate or advanced aquarist this book is not a resource of information."
4,A Comprehensive Overview of Problem Gambling in America,"Dr. Volberg has given us a comprehensive overview of problem gambling gambling in America. This book is of value to both the casual observer and the serious student of this issue. Problem gambling is THE issue for the gambling industry, including the state and tribal governments who are actively engaged in this business. My only criticism is the decision to not address youth gambling. Although I agree that the data are limited on youth gambling problems, I would argue this only highlights the necessity of addressing this issue. However, this minor quibble aside, I highly recommend this book."
3,Beautiful but small,"I ordered this ring in a size 5 and it is beautiful but did not fit. I wear a size 4 3/4 and couldn't get it over my knuckle. Well I probably could have but would have had to cut it off. Definitely order it big. I sent mine back and still haven't heard about my refund. Didn't feel like I should pay return shipping since I ordered the correct size, it just wasn't sized true. Order at least 1/2 size larger than needed. Still waiting on my refund though."
5,An Essential Tome for Anyone Researching California Water Issues,Mr. Kahrl has provided an essential reference work for anyone researching California water issues. Work needs to be updated and republished.
4,Just the Job,"Lightweight, plenty of capacity for adjustments, easy to install and adjust and most importantly, comfortable. This is the first set of aero-bars I have owned so I have nothing to compare to, but I am very pleased with the purchase."
4,A Pediatric Neurology Text with Great Readability,"I thought this would allow you to send me a copy of this book to preview, as it looked like something I could order for my Residents in Pediatrics here at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. I saw this book at a recent Pediatric Conference in Boston, briefly, but as head of the Child Development Center here wanted to review it in more detail prior to making a decision to order several copies for our Residents and also Neurology Colleagues.However what I did see of it looked great! Well set out and very readable. Excellent authors."
4,Sound Integration,This book provides an excellent resource on the fundamental knowledge regarding fish behavior and the environment. A very thoughtful outline to promote your fishing arsenal.
4,Good deal!,I received the boots happily very quickly. They were a Christmas present for my husband. They are nice looking and appear to be well made. My husband commented they were very comfortable immediately. It usually takes a week or two of discomfort to break other boots in. Very happy so far.
2,Misrepresented,"The footbed is cloth not leather and the tongue is made of very uncomfortable stiff plastic. Do not expect much, this is a poorly made product. Very Disappointed"
3,Great books but the printing is too small.,"The Culinaria books in paperback have only a serious inconvenience: the printing is too fine and I needed a magnifying glass to read them. For that reason ONLY I wouldn't recommend them as Xmas gifts, which is a pity."
5,great book,"I realy liked this big book - it is full of information and recipes. The pictures are also very nice. I was too lazy to try any of the recipes, but they seem good."
3,"Great Photos, Tiny Fonts!","I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the fonts are way too small. I feel like I'm reading the ""fine print"" at times. That's a shame because it's otherwise a great book with amazing pics."
5,BRAVO!,"Huge book, full of beautiful pictures depicting all topics discussed in this book. Culinaria Italy not only explains how to make Italian food, it CELEBRATES Italian food. I've been over-joyed with all of the books thus far from the Culinaria series. I just wish they didn't go out of print so fast!"
5,A must have,in any family as a reference. All you need to know and what you didn't know you need to know.
3,Can't complain with price,"Can't complain with the price, but the globe / map of the nations print lacks definition. The continents look more like globs, and some islands aren't even there. It's unfortunate that the upgraded flag (nylon, 3x5) costs at least 8x as much. Whatever, it'll work just fine for my blank room wall."
3,worth it,"well done if dry; print is easy to read and it supplements other works well. I didn't have expectations, so no disappointments."
4,Useful guide for the Bible student,I very useful guide book to better understand differences and similarities between the Gospels. One must remember to factor in who the original authors were writing to.
5,Must have!,"""Gospel Parallels"" is a must have for anyone studying the scriptures. It's very helpful in showing the differences and the sameness of the Synopic gospels."
4,A good resource for studying the Synoptics,"Throckmorton's parallel is a good resource for comparing the Synoptics. There are so few volumes like this one that it is recommended even if it could be improved. First, the NRSV is not really the best translation. I wish this were updated with the ESV. Second, the Infancy Narratives would be more logically organized with the Lucan Narrative first (although I understand the desire to keep as close to the canonical order as possible). This resource is best used with a good commentary or two. One such resource is Gleason Archer's *New International Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties* which will especially help the inexperienced exegete."
3,Ehhh,"They do the job, nothing great or bad to say about this item. You want to hold a cable down, they will do that just fine."
2,Didn't care for it...,I generally enjoy this genre of books but I found this book rather irritating. Perhaps I'd have enjoyed it more if I had older kids.
5,Junior Vasquez and Dynamix club mix is da bomb,"The Junior Vasquez & Dynamix club mix is freakin' hot. It's a dance club mix clocking over 8 minutes. This is an edgy, housey, progressive, circuitry dance mix. This club mix is a universal song meaning it will play at all dance clubs gay or straight, not just gay clubs. Be warned, there's alot of the F word repeated throughout the dubbing of the song, especially the intro buildup in the beginning. a 100 times better than the album boring version. Of course i heard that the Hani club mix of Pink's Stupid Girls is the best mix but it isn't on this import single. But this Junior Vasquez mix will do."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I did not feel this cd to be among her best, She's by far my favoritefemale vocalist, but MOMENTS was a disappointment to me..."
1,Not her best work...,"This album feels like a rush-job to me. It has the effect of listening to someone doing karoake. Too bad she's doing karoake to her own hits. These were new recordings when Vestal was new again in the 1990s--it's truly unfortunate that most of her attempts during this era are marked by productions that didn't allow for her considerable powers of expression.It sounds like she's just doing this by rote here.... The best of Vestal's later work can be found among the Gaither Homecoming CDs and on her own ""Hymns for Life."""
1,I guarantee you will return it.,"Why Amazon would sell a product like this I cannot explain. I read the other two reviews thinking it wouldn't be as bad, but is was. Dry, old, falling into pieces when I opened the box. Spend a few dollars more and get a high quality product."
2,Cheap looking...,"As all of the Prada Nylon bags shown here, it looks cheap. The bag is not worth $60. Definitely is not worth the retail $250 price. Looks like something you can get for $20 or so. I bought the other fuxia bag to match this... I got this hoping to use it as a gift but it didn't look high-quality at all. I had to return it."
1,gave up on it,I gave up reading it after 2 chapters. It's full of mathematical formulas and equations that made it almost impossible for me to follow....Waste of money and time.
5,No fluff--plenty of good information.,"Very impressive material. Covers the philosophy behind the text, nutrition, exercises (with detailed explanations) and workout routines, along with plenty more. One of the great things about the workouts is that you don't have to have expensive gym equipment to perform them; a person can use many of the exercises in this book to get a full body workout with a pair of barbells and an incline bench. I also liked the fact that the authors didn't try to push a specific supplement on you (unlike other popular books on this subject). Overall, this book has plenty of information and not too much motivational fluff (which always drives me nuts!)."
4,It worked for my husband....,"I bought this book for my husband who was frustrated with the yo-yo dieting and work-outs that weren't helping him tranform his body. He was slightly overweight and stuck in a rut. With the help of this book, he lost 22 pounds in 6 mths. and has kept it off for 2 years. He's tranformed his chubby frame into a leaner more muscular one. This book is not a diet, but a lifestyle make-over - that's why it works. I gave it 4 stars because the layout of the book could be a little better and there should be more food choices and sample recipes. It really works!"
5,Great to get started working out,"It's a great book to get started working out. I joined a gym three weeks ago and got two fitness books. This one is good. It gives all the biological background and training theory. Plus, has an extensive section of exercises and the proper form. I find most of the exercises that my personal trainer shows me inside them. So, after my trainer shows it to me in the gym, I can review it in the books to get all the details right.The background section at the beginning was very good and seemed more intelligent and researched then the advice that buddies give me."
3,From a Lifter/Scientist perspective,"This book is a good basic overview of lifting (the nutritional advice is scant and not entirely accurate). None of the exercises are innovative, and the workouts are not adequate to continue gains if you've already been training for awhile. For a beginning lifter, not too bad...most of the books honestly suck, so this is a mediocre 3 star, no better, no worse. There are better books, and once I'm out of medical school, I'll finish mine :) Strength Training Anatomy is amazing (think Netters). I returned this book after reading it, not worth keeping, or having as part of my reference library."
3,Not that much different than the women's version,"An OK book, but not great. Some of the information is outdated and/or not really supported by clinical evidence. But the beginner's routines are well organized, and progress at a reasonable rate to insure progress without too much pain. A good book to get started, but you willoutgrow it rapidly."
5,"Great book , provided me whith what i look for","The most thing that i liked about this book , besides being well written & well readble by those whos mother tunge not english, is it presents 2 routines of wourkout exercises :The first one is by using just a pair of dumbells ,which is more suitble for a home workout whithout complex machines involved ,so a person has not to participate in any gym .The 2nd routine's exercises are based on machines you find it in the gym , very equipmented gym .The book covers all the body parts , whith lot types of workout for each part.Not forgetting the nutrition section , which has very usefull information a person can get .Finally , i would like to thank the aouthers , for thier writting's style ,which has never made me bored .Afterall , a person should know to make the book intersting for the readers as he knows to make his body exercises well performed ."
3,Different approach to working out,"The 14 day program that is talked about in this book is an excellent approach to exercising (body building or any other training for your body).It is not a ""14 days"" and get results program. ""14 days"" is just part of a methodology for body building (and a good one too).If you are bored with your current work out routine, try this book. It may work for you."
4,Very Nicely Done,"I really liked how this book is organized. For a novice looking for a clear fitness path, this is an excellent book. The workout routines are broken up into two ""break-in"" routines followed by more advanced ones. It is written in clear, very readable language and it also addresses broader health issues.I recommend this book for someone who has a few dumbbells along with other basic exercise equipment and is looking for a coherent how-to manual that explains fitness in very understandable terms. The authors have done a very good job at making fitness accessible and the tone of the book is very realistic and enjoyable throughout."
3,not bad,I would not recomend this book says alot of stuff that just isn't true. But there is a few tips but i ended up selling this one back and getting Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding which is alot better!
4,"Should be called ""The Body Sculpting Bible for OVERWEIGHT""","I am a novice to bodybuilding and I wanted to find an all-in-one solution for my workouts, with nutrition information, scheduling, excersises, etc. I must admit that this book answered practically all my questions, and the price is decent, too. The only disappointment for me was that it focuses on overweight people. A good deal of the nutrition section, as well as descriptions of several excercises, are weight-paranoid, and extra weight is NOT (thank God) a problem for me at all, I'm a skinny guy. It would be perfectly fine if I knew about this bias before I opened the book, I would probably buy it any way, but the authors fail to give even a slightest hint that a lot of their info benefits men with several extra pounds."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"This is a beginners workout book that anyone serious about shaping their body would outgrow within weeks of training.The body sculpting programs were briefly explained in under five pages, too little when its really the regimens that should highlight the book. Good descriptions of exercises and how they are performed. Too much erroneous info about working out in general that does not tie in with the brief explanations of the different body sculpting regimens that are almost noted down as if they were an afterthought in the rear of the book.That said I think there alternatives that will offer greater longterm use and enjoyment as well as more in depth training advice."
4,Good book,It was a very good book with workout routines and everything. However i did have a problem with the nutrition with the constant protein shakes and a very limited selection of food. But it is a very good book for a beginer and would recomend it as a starting place.
4,"A couple of grammatical errors, but still great","First off, I liked the book a lot. Yes, there are a few grammatical errors, but hey, that doesn't effect the content!The book covers all aspects of physical conditioning and provides a detailed road map that's easy to follow.All in all the book is a must have for anyone serious about looking and feeling good!"
2,Hmmm Not So Good !,Hard to read and follow. Not set up for the novice. I like the photos however there are so many it's nearly impossible to do everything they are asking. This may not be for the novice.
1,How to overtrain,"If you want to learn how to over train, then go ahead and buy this book. I've just finished reading it and am willing to sell it for $2 cos it ain't worth any more than that. To train with weights 6 days a week and cardio and abs 6 days a week you'll burn out pretty quick. It doesn't mention about recovery weeks either, just train, train and train. If you want better books, try Serious Strength Training by Tudor Bompa, Get Buffed by Ian King (www.getbuffed.net or www.kingsports.net) and for your Abs check out anything by Paul Chek."
1,Self marketing????,"How amazing that the top two 5 star reviews that INCREDIBLY helped so many fine folks, are exactly the same review from the words ""I'm currently doing the 14-Day Body Sculpting ...""!Check it out...The best a man can get..., February 19, 2002Reviewer: timothyigobran from Cambridge, Massultimate in men's fitness, September 4, 2003Reviewer: chefgrad (see more about me) from Toronto, Ontario CanadaI think that you should save your money & purchase from an author who doesn't self promote, & doesn't think that future readers are morons & won't notice those posts. Who knows, maybe the whole book is plagerized."
4,Good Book,This is a great book to get started in the gym. My husband and I bought these books to get some ideas for workouts. You can cater it to your own needs or you can follow their routine.
3,Good guide for the year 2000,"We thought this was a decent guide. It provides 2-4 week home confinment preparedness information. We liked the shelf life information, the 100 item checklist and the different water treatment options. It would have been 4 stars and a steal at $5.00"
3,Spotty,"This passable story of a serial killer in London's West End is rather undermined by the incredibly silly motive for the killings. Told by weaving together the storylines of the killer, the head policeman investigating the murders, and the reporter covering the story, there's not a whole lot of mystery to the tale, as the author gives the reader all the information and lets the story play itself out. In and of itself, it's a decent police procedural, as plodding door-to-door investigation tightens the noose around the killer, who is both arrogant, and unable to control his need to kill. He's a well-drawn character, a pimply-faced motorcycle courier with few friends and a disproportionate hatred for tourists. It's kind of a pulpy story, with an overly dramatic ending, but solid and sordid enough in its own way to entertain one for two hours."
5,Classic and masculine never goes out of style!,"This stalwart should be in EVERY man's repertoire of grooming. I can't understand why many stores no longer carry this (""they don't make it anymore"").... yet they carry every Hip hop, NBA, movie star overpriced iteration of the same old ""watermelon meets rotten leather"" smell!This is classic citrus with a hint of floral currents... buff enough to say ""I am a macho man"" yet discrete enough to say ""I am gentle and bring flowers, champagne, and back rubs to my lover""....... all I know my wife agrees..... and THAT is good enuf for me...."
1,Caution: 2009 Calendar(?),"Clues in the ad suggest that this is a 2009 calendar. Someone may be in the market for this, but not very many. The year for a calendar should always be boldly stated.Sorry that this ""review"" is not as ""fun"" as you might like."
5,Great Item,Knew what I was buying and was exactly what I thought it would be. Showed up at the same time as the other item I purchased. Thanks.
4,Great as a shelf piece but dont play with it,"This figure is sculpted very nicely and has no problems standing on his base. My main problem is that he has trouble holding most of his guns due to the position of his hands (and the lack of grabbable surfaces on the guns) so i really only let him hold a few of the ones that i know wont fall out. other than that, hes great (but i wouldn't recommend him as a toy since he doesn't have any real articulation) and watch out that you don't break his very flimsy tie."
4,Overall it's about what you'd expect for the price.,"It's not the best figurine ever but for the price it looks great and it's nice that you can equip Agent 47 with your favorite weapons from the game. Well, not sure if the tranquilizer gun is there. ;) Thumbs up overall though.As far as educational... doesn't really apply. I don't think the figurine is very durable either, at least I wouldn't give it to a 5y.o. and expect the detailing to last very long. Guarding my gf's cubicle however... I expect no durability issues."
5,"Honest, funny, and (for me) powerfully faith-affirming","Autobiographical reflections of a convert to Catholicism, about her committed struggles with marriage and with faith. (""A Catholic feminist? Dear God, couldn't I please be something else?"") What I love about this and all of Nancy Mairs's books is her uncompromising honesty about the difficulties of living a human life, and the way she shows that joy and gratitude and humor can be found right in the midst of the big mess we're in. I'm on my third or fourth copy of this book because I keep giving it away. This and ""Waist-High in the World"" are my favorites by Mairs."
2,not my style,"i really thought by the title of the book that i would really enjoy it. Even the other review were great. It started out fanstastic, took my breath away, and then left me hanging. I didnt enjoy all the drama, and i finally gave up, returned it.Wish I could be more positive on it, as I said, the story line, had it not had all the drama and the let downs, would have been more enjoyable for me.Zero ice cube review."
1,Couldn't even finish,"I always finish my book, but I couldn't drag myself through this one. The language was pretty enough, but the characters lacked any kind of definition in my opinion, but my major problem with this novel was that the heroine instantly, and I mean instantly, fell in love with her ""master"" with absolutely no reason, and he wasn't even particularly likeable..Shallow at best.. Torture at worst, and not the good kind of torture."
4,Take Time,"Every now and again one comes across a piece of music that deserves time. This octet is one such. It is not the kind of music to use as a background for its gentle complexity takes the mind out of the mundane into realms where one rarely travels. Lost in the sounds I have moved the CD to my ipod ready for a long flight to NZ. With 28 hours at my disposal I shall listen to schubert's legacy many times for I suspect that familiarity will, in this case, enhance respect. I hope it works for you. Brian Maunder"
4,A great value in need of an editor,"This booklet has some inadvertant gems of contextual theory. I bought it as a rank beginner and couldnt make heads or tails of it because it assumes a certain level of knowledge. If you're like me, you've eased into a core staple of patterns and progressions - this booklet helps me break out of that limited universe and expand.There are some pure errors that are a big problem for an instructional book. They can be found very early in the book and diminish it's value, since when I play a progression in the book that doesn't sound right I wonder if it's me or the book that's doing something wrong. Example, the chord chart on the top of page 8 labels an F7 chord as F major.For the $5.95 price however it's a good deal. It'd be a great deal at $9.95 if the extra $4 were invested in an editor."
1,Didn't help this struggling guitarist,"I've been trying to improve my guitar playing for most of my adult life. Put simply, this book didn't help at all. I didn't understand much of what the author was trying to convey, and I've had some music theory in the past. I hope there's a helpful book out there for those of us who are interested in learning more about the guitar, but for me this wasn't it."
5,Does the trick.,"If you are looking for a good,basic,cheep flash drive, look no further you found one."
5,Great,"I bought this over a month ago, I have had no problems with it. Does what it's supposed to do!"
3,Cheap but slow.,Don't expect to quickly put data onto this device.SLOWWWW transfer to but NOT from.Data comes off super quick.Affordable but SLOW!
1,Insanely Overpriced,"Wow...I was looking at ordering additional copies of this publication for my staff, and found this listing. The $360.00 it is listed for is insane. You can order from the publisher for $2.00 per copy."
5,Great book from a Great Man,This is a great book to help you grow in your faith!This book is a must. God Bless and r.i.p. Rev. Falwell.
5,t'ai chi chih! Joy Thru Movement by Justin Stone,Excellent! I wish this was available in DVD form!. The book is well written and the photos are very helpful. I did T'ai Chi Chih many years ago and had forgotten some of the movements but this has brought it all back.
5,Wisom and Meditative Joyful Movements for All to Enjoy,"I found the ancient wisdom and the adaptation of 19 meditative movements that Justin Stone developed for all to be able to do, to be nothing short of life changing and life affirming.This book has visual photos of Justin Stone demonstrating each of the movements, in addition to information describing the philosophy and important principles of T'ai Chi Chih.The beauty of this meditative practice is that virtually anyone can participate and benefit from it. To me, this kind of physical inclusiveness is ground breaking.I believe this book to be a ""must have"" for students wishing to improve their techniques of the 19 movements, plus an ""essential"" resource for anyone who aspires to be an accredited teacher."
1,Tai Chi Chih!: Joy Thru Movement,"I am a taijiquan instructor and would advise anyone to be very warry of this title. The statement, ""...complete information on the background and philosophy of this holistic discipline..."" sent a big red flag up for me. Taijiquan was developed as a martial (fighting) art, not a ""holistic discipline"". Doing taiji will give you health benefits from the physical exersize, and through increased qi (chi) circulation (which must be taught), but it is not the primary reason the art was developed. If you are more interested in health/qi benefits, then get a book on qigong. There are many books that are far better than this one, buy authors that really know what they are talking about. One of them is Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. Any of his books, tapes, or DVS's would be highly recomended."
5,Still We Want More!!!,"It's amazing how Michel Gondry has created one of the fantastic career in the music video & commercial industry. If Volume 1 was a fantastic playhouse of imagination & happiness, Volumen 2 is more adult... perhaps more dark. But there is singular point of view on everthing Gondry has done: It's fantastic & great.Even with this second Volumen of this short work you miss some of his best videos. It's amazing... how Gondry is going to need a third Volume, for put some of his latest (& greatest) videos:1. Kaney West - Heard They Say (a fantastic night in MACY'S)2. Devendra Banhart - A ribbon3. The Poliphonic Spree - Light & Day4. The Vines - Ride5. The Vines - Winning Days6. Stardust - Music sounds better with love (I love that aeroplane story)7. Lenny Kravitz - Believe8. Rachid Taha - Voilà, voilà, qu'a r'commence9. Mia Doi Todd - Open your heart"
5,Must buy!!,This is a wonderful cookbook! My brother has had it for years so I have been able to taste several yummies from it. Finally had to buy one for myself. I highly recommend it!
3,"Breakfast Book, Recipes","This was not what I expected, thou recipes are easy to follow. I like pictures of reach recipe, so it should be noted in description that there are NONE! This would be great as a gift for newly weds, singles venturing out on their own, etc."
5,The Best!,"This cookbook is fabulous. I have given as gifts numerous times, and have been told by each recipient that it is the favorite cookbook! I have even bought this cookbook used to give as a gift when it was out of print for awhile! The pancakes and waffles are terrific, and the other recipes are great, lots of new and old things to try. I am a collector and I have one thing to say: Buy it! This is a must have cookbook!"
3,overpriced,"You can probably find both these games used at a video store for a whole lot less than any online two pack. That being said, the remake of Resident Evil 1 is one of the best games that came out on gamecube. It's definitely worth owning. It's got the awkward camera of the original, but pre-rendering the backgrounds allowed them to build character models that almost stand up today... the graphics look really really clean for how dated the game is. To give you an idea, the opening cinema with the dogs outside the mansion, is the exact video they used in Resident Evil Umbrella chronicles, that just came out for wii. I enjoyed this game a lot more than resident evil 4, it's got a much more serious tone... you get survival horror rather than ninja/action garbage. 1 is great, I never messed with zero at all."
4,Book two of four,"Linda Howard's early works are some of the best series titles Shillouette ever published. Diamond bay (Kell Sabine's story)is the second in a four book thread that started with Midnight Rainbow, and continues with White Lies and Heartbreaker. Sabine is the thread that binds all four stories together. I think Kell Sabine was the genesis for the character of John Medina in the later works Kill and Tell and All the Queen's Men. A shadowy figure whom no one ever really knows, he must give up his natural caution and distrust to open himself to that one special woman. I found Sabine easier to like than Medina, but still, he is one of Ms Howard's harder to love creations. If you can, get all four books and enjoy. I liked them as well as, if not more than the Mackenzie saga."
3,Where's the Bathroom?,"When Rachel finds a man struggling in the surf and rescues Kell Sabin from drowning, I am able to suspend belief. I am even able to suspend belief again when she asks a vet to stitch the man's wound, keep it a secret just in case he's in trouble for the right reasons, and that is where it ends for me. I honestly wanted to like this book, and I didn't mind that it reflected an 80's vibe with head hopping, a stereotypical heroine, and a tough alpha male. I enjoyed the steamy sex scenes and the emotional depth that Linda is known for as a writer. However, what I can't believe is that a man is in a bed for three days and doesn't get up ONCE to go to the bathroom. He'd be septic and near death. And in no way is that sexy. He also hasn't bathed. Gross.I'd really like to give it a 2.5 but we can't do that on this site."
2,Unless you want a project look elsewhere.,"While I still use this bass there are several problems I have had with it.This bass is very NECK HEAVY. I have a 3"" suede strap and the neck will still drop to the floor if I don't control it. It takes unecessary effort just to counter the effect.The WIRING is shoddy. The knobs were not secured and while adjusting the volume the wires fell appart. I gave up on this bass at this point for a while. I've since rewired the whole thing and got it in working order. The wires themselves are very thin and prone to breakage. I replaced and resoldered them all.The PICKUPS are not shielded so expect a ton of crackling or other interference.The AMP is not worth the space it takes up.This is my second try as I returned the first one right away, because the neck was so twisted.There are much better starter/beater basses than this. This one is not worth the hassle if you just want a fully working bass."
2,"Good Bass for the Price, Terrible Amp.",We got this bass as a starter model for my kid. Its working well for that but the amp broke after a month and the Strap for the soft case tore off after just two months. I guess you get what you pay for but I'm disappointed in the cheap accessories. I would not buy this package again.
4,Very helpful resource,Product was received quickly and in good condition. This is a very helpful resource for me as I lead a Bible study group for widows. I'm also lending this book to group members for their further study. Thanks for providing this!
4,A must for digital DJ's,"I picked this and the first volume up the other day and was really happy with both. Most, if not all, the tracks are highly playable, and very well produced. I highly recommend this to any house head, especially if you are looking for a good non-mixed album."
3,It's Okay,This was pretty to look at and the little one felt like a princess but for her first communion it was not feasible to wear as it would not stay on her head. That was disappointment. It just doesn't sit right and you have to use all kinds of extra stuff to get it clipped on and stay on.
4,Very good local history,"I just like oral histories, and this one about an Alabama moonshiner whose son takes his recipe to make a legalized whiskey is particularly intriguing because it creates a human story to go along with the demonized image of the moonshiner. Other books in this ""Conecuh Series"" are equally good, although each one is topically and stylistically different."
1,it didn't work,"I bought it for my brother, he is a diabetic, it didn't make any tiny improve, not at all, so I don't know if others can work with them or what, I take the same dosage that wrote on the bottle"
3,Extremely slow delivery,"The item itself was very fine, it was a present, so according to what I heard, it was dearly cherished and liked. However, it arrived with extreme delay and there was no postal strike in the US, as far as I'm aware of (I live in Canada, and there was a postal strike, and still, an envelope I sent from Vancouver arrived earlier than the aforementioned item, and I had shipped it earlier than said envelope). Other than that, no complaints. The table is gorgeous, and the price is very fair.I really only wished the delivery had been more efficient.Thanks, though."
5,Essential but easy-to-read essays on parenting,"There really are only a few books a parent needs to ""do it right."" Joan Beck's ""How to Raise a Brighter Child"" and Prudence MackIntosh's essays in her trilogy of books: ""Thundering Sneakers,"" Retreads,"" and ""Sneaking Out."" The MackIntosh books are better than chocolate, whether you have a boy or a girl. And on those frequent occasions when I am at my wits' end and rapidly losing perspective, her books bring me right back. You'll laugh with a lump in your throat the whole way through."
5,Will Our Tears Forever Flow,"This book was written from a proud, but griefing heart.This book gives a real picture of loosing and dealing with the loss of a loved one.It brings to reality that a loved one can be lost in a blink of an eye, so every minute in life should be charished.It has brought to me comfort, about bring up a lost loved one's name, the book mentioned that they like to here the name of a loved one mentioned. And that memories are carried on."
5,I did not recieve my Da Questa Parte del Mare CD,Hallo. I was supposed to recieve the CD Da Questa Parte del Mare in Early February. I Did not recieve it yet. Will you be able to tell me where it is. I do not know who to mail. Will you please mail me.RegardsDewaldt de kockdewaldt@doxadeo.co.za
1,Sits on my bookshelf,"Jazz Piano Voicings proved to be a waste of money for me. The exercises are redundant, boring and hard to read for a non-expert sight reader. Some of them, to my ear, just sound awful. The ideas in this book could have been presented in a few pages instead of 202. For the same price, much better books are available that show one harmony, scales, modes, rhythms and all the good stuff that jazz is made of. My favorite book for piano voicings isJazz Piano Concepts & Techniques"
5,Sheer Beauty,"This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime musical experiences-melodic songs, sumptuous arrangements and a voice of pure, molten gold. I don't care if your taste in music is rock, country or classical, if there's an ounce of music appreciation in your mind and heart, this CD will blow you away-gently, with its sheer, all-consuming beauty. This is what music should be-a transcendent blend of sounds that cannot be unfamiliar to the angels."
2,If you just want a bunch of musings and pictures its great,"This is definitely not a how to book. That's OK. But it struck me as a series of 'hey, you might want to try to make this cool wrap around vase'. Ok I might. Now what? There is nothing here but the most basic stuff like 'test to make sure the test tube fits. Keep your cut-offs. Now sand and you're done'. This book shows you how to fold a blade so it must be aimed at beginners. Now I don't need my hand held to build stuff, but cutting compound curves for perhaps the first time require a little more depth than 'keep your cutoffs'.I can ask the guy sitting next to me on the bus what might be a cool thing to build."
5,2001 jeep wrangler 4 cyl,"I ordered this for my 2001 jeep 2.5l 4 cyl. I removed and painted the valve cover, I used this with no rtv (per directions) and it seals wonderfully. The blue looks cool with my red cover too!"
5,I Want to Live Review!!!,"I Want to Live is a really good book. I like this book because it tells you what it's like to have cancer. I don't think this book could be any better. If you were looking for a book I would recommend this one especially if you were a girl.Dawn, the main character, was in remission, but then she needed a bone marrow transplant. Your going to have to read it yourself to find out what happens."
5,I Want to Live,"I Want to Live is the second book in the Dawn Rochelle series. This book was, in my opinion, the best book in the Dawn Rochelle series. Dawn has to get a bone marrow transplant, and her brother, Rob is a compatible donor. Her doctor said that if she doesn't get a bone marrow transplant, she'll die. After she got the transplant, she got really sick. She died for a few seconds. She had no vital signs, but she wasn't completely dead yet. The doctors managed to revive her. Her being alive was a miracle, because she came to close to death. There wasn't anything about this book that I didn't like. Lurlene McDaniel has this way that her books just captivate you. You can't put them down. And she makes you become attached to the main character(s) that makes you feel as if you know them in real life."
4,I Want to Live,This is a very good book!Lurlene Mcdaniel is a very good author!This book is about a thirteen year old girl who has luekimia.She wonders how she got luekimia at such a young age?How would you feel?
5,Very Good Book,This book is a very touching and moving story. I have read the book all the way through 11 times! If you like intensity at the end and drama and excitement then this book is for you.
1,Beaters wobble,"Mixer looks good, has a good slow speed and priced well - BUT one beater wobbled. Amazon promptly replaced the mixer but the replacement had 2 wobbling beaters and no dough hooks!!Time for a refund."
2,low power,"I have to agree with other reviewers, this is a weak mixer. If you want only to mix a few eggs or something very thin, then this will do. However, upon whipping some whipping cream when I first got this mixer, I stood there quite a while waiting for it to do the job.. It just doesn't have enough power at 75 watts, to do much. You need at least 200 watts to get the job done and 250 if your planning on mixing cookie dough. I can't even imagine trying that with this mixer. I won't be taking it back, because I bought it locally and waited too long. Guess it'll go to the thrift store."
4,Gift for Mom,This was purchased as a gift for our Mother. It was mainly brought because she wanted a red mixer. Mom has stated the mixer is light enough for her to use and loves all the attachments. Other than that I can't say anything else because I haven't used it myself.
4,"Finally, A Mixer with a ""Real"" Low-Speed Setting","I don't have the kind of baking habit that requires an expensive stand mixer with a bowl but I still wanted something well-made and sturdy.I also wanted something that wouldn't splatter chocolate chip cookie dough all over the entire kitchen when I go to blend in dry ingredients.This mixer succeeds in both areas.It's nice-looking, easy-to-use and easy-to-store.I agree with some of the other reviews that it's not crazy powerful, even on the highest setting, so don't buy it if you regularly do heavy-duty mixing (though I have no idea what requires this - are people making cement?).For pancakes, cookies, cakes, etc. this works wonderfully."
1,Junk!!!!,"This was the worst hand mixer! It is cheap in quality, but not in price. I now understand why it didn't list the wattage on the box....there is none. Very weak, even on #5. Stay away from this product."
2,Missing parts,"Product arrived in timely manner for Christmas, but when opened was missing one of the beaters so had to be returned."
3,Kinda disappointed,"Of course, it is very nice to have pretty much every Carroll work you could want in one volume, however there is one major drawback here. While the blue leather binding and gold gilt text and page edges are quite nice, I found the actual pages to be a very low quality thin paper. Also, the margins are very small, cramming alot of text on each page, while the paper and print quality actually take away a minor of the illustration detail. Overall, not a bad collection, yet I think ""The Complete Works of Lewis Carroll"" thru B&N; is superior even without the bells and whistles.MK"
5,The Great Alice-creator comes out in person!!,"Wonderful.....wonderful. Lewis Carroll is a genius to behold. Which such books as Alice and Looking Glass (which I like better than Alice) Lewis Carroll has made us have wonderful entertainment for ages. Sylvie and Bruno is in it.... including The Tangled Tale, Sylvie and Bruno Concluded, Alices Adventures Under-ground, Rhyme? and Reason? The Hunting of the Snark, Three Sunsets, and, of course, the two Alice books.A toast to Lewis Carroll!"
5,Great Book!!!!!,I love Alice in Wonderland and I can't wait until I read Through the Looking Glass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Alice in Wonderland,"I reviewd this story as an interesting use of the authors imagination, also the way Lewis Carroll had a great ideas for characters for example : the Mad Hatter, the Weeping Turtle, the Diabolical Queen of Hearts , Cheshire the Cat, Tweedledum, Tweedle, and the Dutchess. All these characters were so interesting because I have never heard things like that berfore and thins like ""Alice"" drowning in her own puddle of tears.These things you don't see in a typical girl's dream basically all that's in a typical girls dream is flowers, playing with their dolls ,and girly stuff like that. This story also tells about how dreams can come true to you but not existing to no one else but you'r self . This story has affected me by looking inside me and others to see how we are in several ways in the dreams that we have . The writer is giving a message on how dreams can come true no matter what will happen. But other than that I liked this story it was very interesting."
2,Better for a child,"I read this book recently because I never had as a child. I love the disney movie and through the looking glass film, so I decided that I needed to give the book a shot. I am 21 now, and the book was a bore to me. Those two films were very similar to the book, I recomend them instead (which is something I don't usually do.) It could not keep my interest because there was to much going on to fast. I do believe a child would get a kick out of it, but as for me, nope."
1,very bad paper quality,"I was expecting a quality product from this 'deluxe' edition. From the outside it looks solid, but the pages are made of see-through paper, thinner than from a dictionary.. Not only does it undo the advantages of a hard cover, leather bound etc, but it also ruins the many drawings inside the book. Of course the internet-customer is ignorant of this quality aspect until the book arrives in his/her own disappointed hands."
5,Lewis Carroll: The Compete Works,"My 15 year old daughter is a Lewis Carroll fan. She loves this book,[[ASIN:0517147815 Lewis Carroll: The Complete, Fully Illustrated Works, Deluxe Edition] the beautiful cover, ]illustrations and the typeface. My husband and I both ordered copies of the ""Complete works"" without telling each other. He spent more for his copy and it is not anywhere near as nice. The seller discription was correct and my choice is the one she is keeping (*wink*) she is going to sell the other copy."
5,Certainly a land of Wonder,Lewis Carols book Alice in Wonderland and Through the looking glass was truly wonderful. It was full of flowing words and vivid imagry. Alice in Wonderland is a great book for all ages. The young and the old would enjoy this books far fetched plot and crazy yet fun tongue twisting dialog. This book will truly get your imaginative juices flowing. If your are a bit older this book will bring you back to those days when your imagination was a bit more active. I was truly amazed that a single person could create such imagry and spark such an intrest. The book was a bit hard to follow at first but one will soon get used to this old fashioned style of writting. The print is small and the book is long but it is definatly worth reading. I gave the book five stars becasue I have never read anything that even comes close to comparing to this book.
5,Lewis Carroll,"its a book, if you dont know who Lewis Carrol is then google the Twilight series instead .."
4,Loves the one with the cases!,My daughter is 4 yrs old and she seems to love all Pet shop pets that come with the carring cases. Those are the ones she seems to play with most. I think it just depends on your child.

4,Thought this was a set,"Thought this was a set of 3. The picture was misleading, but I am very happy with the berry colander (smallest pictured)! This was a wedding gift :)"
2,Bigger issue than I thought,"Well, many people said the bottom is concave upward and I ignored it like many others. The goal of this item is to drain water. You place the wet items there and wait for few minutes to dry. The problem is after half an hour you pick it up and the water pours out from the bottom. This is much bigger problem than you think.Also, I noticed on one of the three, under neat of the outside lip is rusting. Stainless steel does not rust."
5,Really Comfortable strap!,"Really comfortable strap for the price. It is padded and durable. Makes for a great guitar/ bass guitar strap. Once you get a padded leather strap, you won't want to use fabric or nylon ones ever again!"
2,Not for Tall Players,"First of all, I am not one of those player who plays the guitar at his knees. This strap was entirely to short for me. I am 6'3"" and at its longest length, the bottom of my guitar was at my waist.The quality is fine and the padding is sufficient, however, unless you prefer playing guitar/bass very high or you are less than 5'6"", I would not recommend it."
3,dual cigarette lighter outlet,"CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE, BUT IT TENDS NOT TO STAY IN THE LIGHTER. HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING IT BACK IN."
2,Look else where,The item in description is not what I received. I received a cheaper one listed on Amazon as well that looks closely like this one. The item is cheap and the spring loaded tip will push the adapter out of the power / cigarette lighter while driving. Not completely happy I got not what I wanted but to return it will be a waste of time. I have been happy with all my other orders from Amazone so I'll let this one slide.
2,Not worth reading,"Berezin presents his attempts to get into Yale as that of someone striving mightily against monumental odds, but he's actually more a grim, programmed overachiever from Central Casting. The wealthy, Jewish son of a lawyer with a 4.3 GPA and a carefully-cultivated list of extra-curricular activities, Berezin is exactly the kind of person we expect to meet (and in fact often do) on Ivy League campuses these days. Pathologically self-absorbed, smug and humorless people seldom write interesting books. This one is no exception and does Berezin--and Yale--no favors."
1,What Yale is looking for in a student?,"This book was useful as an outline of what a college-bound student can do to make an impression on an Admissions office.That's the best thing I can force myself to say about this publication, a book by an extremely ambitious young man. The text is peppered with a weisenheimer-esque, hyper self-centered attitude. Good to see a kid with oodles of self-confidence get what he's after. But often he comes off as part of the elitist, scratch-your-way-to-the-top, realm that I'd assumed Ivy League schools were nowadays trying to distance themselves from.Reading this creepy book gave me a negative impression of Yale's standards."
2,Nice try but not quite,"If you've read ""Illusion"" you know what I mean. The book is good, I like the settings of 18th century India at the time of the British settlement that were used as inspiration of the story, but the characters were too bidimensional. You never quite got to know them deep inside, its as if they're just actors playing a role, very unlike ""Illusion"" were you could feel the passion and see the souls of the characters. And the secondary characters were used as fillers, just to make it look complex. But even so, it's not boring, it's as deep a reading as the previous books and its quite entertaining, but it didn't leave me thinking like Illusion did at the end, which by the way was pretty easy to find out. But these are only my opinions, and I encourage people to find out by themselves, as I did with Illusion, which is still my favorite. This one might turn out to be yours."
5,Daughter loves it!!,"My 7 year old daughter used birthday money to buy this, and she has been bouncing ever since! She was able to balance and bounce within 5 minutes of putting it together (which is pretty simple). She has a ""pogo moon hopper"", so she is used to this type of toy. She likes us to count how many bounces she can do, and we had to stop her at 1000! Great exercise and lots of fun for the money!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 9 year old daughter at Christmas 2007. She saw the commercials and wanted it really bad. She has never been able to master this toy and none of her friends have either. It requires a lot of coordination and it is very clumsy to try and use. I think she was only able to get up on this thing once but it only lasted about 10 seconds before she was down again. Now it just sits in her closet unused and we've tried to give it away, but nobody wants it either.Don't waste your money on this toy and buy a regular pogo stick. She just got one for her birthday and enjoys it much better."
2,not child or adult friendly,"the picture makes it look like the handle stays up, however that is a bungie chord and very hard to manuever. i could hardly do it and i am 26 years old. it is also not the safest toy being that the bungie chord can come swinging into your face if not able to handle it properly. not for young children. (or adults, unless you are super)"
1,No No No,"I bought this for my 6 year old for his birthday. He wanted a pogo stick. I figured this one would be easier for him to use this one. I do not recommend this toy. It is very hard to get on. The ball that has to be blown up, has to be the exact size or it will not work. The only way he can bounce on it is for me to hold it up."
2,hard to get the hang of,"This item was very easy to put together and seems very sturdy, but it is very difficult to use. My 8 year old who is very athletic has had a hard time getting the hang of getting on this and actually jumping more than a couple of times on it. Hopefully with more practice her and her friends will be able to enjoy it."
3,Not for the begginer,"The author is a very learned man and not a bad writer, but unless you are an expert in the field, this book can be hard to follow. I am a fairly knowledgable amateur in the field of old testament history, but often found this book very tough going. I don't think I got everything out of this book that a scholar would. There are better books available for the layman than this book. Old testament history is a fascinating subject, so find the other books. Amazon will lead you to them, but you can start with Israel Finkelstein and William Dever and that should lead you to the rest very easily."
5,Awesome Book,"I absolutely loved this book. I really enjoyed reading true stories about teachers. Though the book was great, I do wish that more young teachers had been featured in it. As a future teacher this book opened my eyes up to so many things that I know will help me later in my career. I would advise all teachers to read this in order to appreciate how far we as educators have come."
4,An eye opener for all teachers and future teachers,"The author chose teachers from various ages, backgrounds and locations to give the readers an idea of what teachers had to endure; as students and teachers. I liked reading how the teachers used what resources they had to teach the students and ignoring the prejudices of other teachers and administrators. They helped to get more parents involved with the schools and started programs to benefit their students. Great teachers, with good insight."
3,A little disappointed,"I have been a long time fan of Mountain Heart, have all of their CD's, and have seen them on many occasions. I was disappointed in this new album, looking for some great new bluegrass hits. Unfortunately, I felt this CD seemed to be more of a ""New Age"" CD that was not typical bluegrass at all. It seems they are trending more toward the loud, rock-type feeling and away from the traditional bluegrass."
5,Fantastic dock,"I recently started using this docking station with my HP Compaq nc6220 for work. It is incredibly easy to use and sturdy. I dont know why its listed as ""basic"" when the so-called ""premium"" station does not even contain a power supply. The mechanism for locking the laptop into place could not be easier and it pops off perfectly everytime when pressing the release button - very quick and easy. Plenty of USB ports. I am thinking of getting one for home as well and elminate the need to carry a power supply except when traveling. Considering the sketchy luck I have had with HP, I think this particular dock is a home run."
1,Did not receive the correct item & item was poor quality,"I gambled on ordering this item, not knowing which colander I would receive. Not only did I receive the wrong one (I got smaller one with apples on it), but it was also in poor condition. The inside of the bowl had scratches on it, and a couple spots were rusted. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM."
2,Not real steel and sizes and pic is totally misleading,I have this b/c I bought it and it's cumbersome to go through the return process. It's the big size (neither of the med/small comes with it). The quality is not that great. Thin steel that is slowly rusting for me. Not the best idea for long term storage/use.
2,Also got the wrong item,"I also got an ""apple"" colander instead of a ""leaf"" colander. It works just like a colander should work. Even though it is a bit smaller than what I thought I was getting, I decided to keep it. I have had no problems with rust or workmanship. This is a perfectly adequate kitchen tool, nothing about it makes me want to break out in song and dance, but I am not unhappy with it either."
2,Dora won't stand up,"Bought this for a cake topper and they were much too heavy. My daughter likes them- she's a big Dora fan, but she gets very frustrated that Dora will not stand on her own like the other figures."
4,Prima is almost there.....,"Prima guides do lack a bit, but this one is good I would say great if the had a MAP for each level instead of those little snap shots but it does help you when you get lost on some of those difficult levels, and the move list is so convienent I love looking down then doing a double spin kick and shooting the guard behind me (thanks to the book fo showing me the moves instead of going into your ""diary"") but all in all it's a good ""help"" guide but no maps."
3,"Solid Effort, Great Band Live","This band reminds me of a Dinosaur Jr. They make pop music that is just a little left of center. It's very fun, with great hooks, just more edgy, which is good. ""All The World Is Waiting"" is a good example of that edgy pop, it evens borders spacey at times. It's a solid LP throughout, but start with ""...Waiting,"" and move forward from there. You won't be disappointed."
4,Panasonic SL-SX451C Portable CD/MP3 Player with Car Kit,Very pleased with this item. It seems to eat up batteries but since I got it to plug into my truck this isn't too much of a concern. I find the sound is good (of course that relies a lot on my speakers) and I think it is very good value for the price.
4,Story telling in the South on the front porch.,How can you write a story about a man you never even knew???? Talk to everyone that had good things to say about him and a few bad. This book is very good. Let's you know how people really lived in the past. Very believable. Great reading.
5,Not a tacked-on yarn,"One's first impulse in seeing a follow up book by an autobiographer is to figure he wrote it to drag some more money out of his sudden massive readership. But, in this case, one would be wrong. Bragg writes this book about his mother's dad, a grandfather Bragg never knew personally. However, Bragg does his homework painstakingly enough to convince the reader that he was presenting the fully real and authentic ""Ava's Man."" Again, I could barely put the book down. An old alcoholic ""failure"" from the South was captivating me. Of course, part of the attraction was learning more about the mother that draws so much respect in Bragg's first book. If you liked All Over But the Shoutin' I encourage you to read this follow up. You won't regret it."
5,Ava's Man,"I have read all of Rick Braggs books and thia was the best. I felt like I just wanted to keep on reading. He is such a powerful writer. I just wish he had more books out there, but the ones he has written are the best. You will not be disappointed reading any of his books. There is no wondering why he is a Pulitzer Prize winner."
5,I felt like I was at home reading this book,"I just loved this book; maybe is it because I grew up in Alabama. I would highly recommend it , and I can't wait to read ""It's All Over But the Shoutin""!"
4,another good author,I first read Mr Bragg's 'It's all over but the shoutin' a few years ago. When I saw that he had written another book about his family I knew I would want to read it. Although I didn't think this book was quite as good as 'shoutin' it is a good book. He takes us into his family. My favorite line in 'shoutin' is when he questions his mom about being out in the cotton fields picking cotton while she had to pull him along as he sat on her sack. He asks her how she did it and her reply was 'you weren't heavy'....that is a mother's love in perfection. Ava's Man takes us back to mountain life and moonshine and local law. I think the author does an excellent job of telling us how life was years ago even though he was not there. How wonderful that he has all this family history.
5,I am crazy about Rick Bragg,"I was lucky enough to hear Mr. Bragg speak at a writers symposium after I had read his first book""All Over but the Shoutin'""and I have been a huge fan ever since.""Ava's Man"" may be even better,if that is possible.His prose is so beautiful and so haunting.I have never had a more intense experiance with a book than I had with these.Please read them they are truly wonderful.5 stars are not enough."
3,Took too long to receive,"There was a big note inside the package that said: ""Wow, mailed the next business day!"" But it took six weeks, that's right - six weeks for it to arrive. I received it on 23 June 2011. The book is good - wish I had received it more timely."
3,A Shadow of a Man,"Who wouldn't want to go back in time & document a grandparents life? Although it was an interesting read, there is a distinct feeling of still not knowing Charlie Bundrum - Ava's man. The character did not come to life as I expected in this book. Bits and pieces of a man's life & nature come together to form a shadow of who & what Charlie was. A great attempt at recapturing a lost time, that left me wanting to know more."
1,Bragg sure likes to brag,"Bragg loves words. He's very skillful with them. He loves his Southern roots, and this story about his grandfather highlights the man's integrity and love for life. But he cannot get out of the way in telling the story. His clever phrases are so abundant they become irritating. One wants to shout, ""Get out of the way and let Charlie do the talking!"" The author was omnipresent, so full of himself, so wanting the reader to know that he was a Very Clever Writer. It's a good story, and if you don't mind the author's overweening self-consciousness you just might like the book."
4,An Interesting Life,"The author never knew his grandfather. Yet he introduces the reader to him with such stories and descriptions that this reader is left feeling he is someone he has known. Ava&#65533;s Man begins just prior to the birth of Charlie Bundrum in 1907 and continues until beyond his death. It is a story of a man coping with whatever life has to offer. The author captures the language and modes of people living in rural Alabama and Georgia in the early twentieth century while giving a vivid description of their life particularly in the depression and World War ll periods. Though the family suffered hard times, Ava&#65533;s Man brought them through with hard work while earning respect of those who knew him. Since the author was born after the death of his grandfather, his information was gleaned from his older relatives and friends who had known him. A man named Hootie who was befriended by Charlie Bundrum adds color to this family story. A very enjoyable book."
5,A great sing along,Nothing makes Saturday chores go better than singing along with this CD. I sing bass and just have a great time being one of the Homecoming crowd.
1,Don't know much about history,"This is junk history and really poor theology. The first clue is when the author parallels the current US society with ancient Rome -- attacking gays, pro-lifers, and modern times. You have to laugh when she talks about Christians in ancient Rome not being able to send their children to school because they would be exposed to pagan ideas, as if the Romans had a modern public school system. The homophobia and anti-abortion rhetoric is strong -- topics that Jesus never even montioned during his beloved time on earth -- and presented as the core of Christian life and beleifs. Fortunately, this is not history at all, but contemporary fantasy and hate. Skip this dribble and try James Carroll or Gary Wills."
2,"Green Chili ""soup""","This product calls for combining the dry ingredients with six (6) cups of water. After 40-plus minutes of cooking, you have what could only be called a soup. Taste? If you have ever had real ""green chili stew"" in New Mexico, you will know ""this jest ain't it!"""
3,Good idea/ So-So execution: Stories vaguely linked to camping,"I think that Ms. Duane had a good idea, but simply didn't invest much effort in selecting stories. Frankly, even some Bret Hart (like Poker Flat) would have been better than some. I did like Xenos beach (now how does a Greek beach vacation relate to campfires??). Waziah by Joe Lansdale is a very good story about Sasquatch -- so that made sense. But ""death to the easter bunny"" was not funny or scary... it was just disturbing. They even put in a prologue to a obscure novel about wolves.We camp a lot with our kids and I think thatWestern Ghosts (American Ghosts)Western Ghosts (American Ghosts) by Frank McSherry, Charles Waugh and Martin Greenberg is much better for the old campfire."
4,My son's favorite video!,"My 19 month-old son can't get enough of this video and it is the first video he requests. It has great background music and presents concepts very well. It is visually beautiful and educational. The only part of the video that gets tiresome is of the children painting, though it doesn't seem that way to my son. This is one of the best videos we own, and we have many."
1,Should be a catagory for 0 Stars,"The Printer won't pull paper thru straight, manual or auto feed.The plastic parts break, my 2 year old printer is held together with a paper clip so it will work. The Graphics a splotchy at best. Their Service is the worst I've encountered. Don't waste your money. Buy a Samsung ML-1430, you'll be glad you did."
4,Cool collection,"Its a cool collection of interviews, newstories, book excerpts, etc. Really concentrates more on peakcockish mods than hard mods. Definatley makes those early mods extremely fanatical."
4,great book for a great movement,"a wonderful, richly detailed compendium of mod literature and philosophy by recognised experts. comes close to putting a finger on an elusive movement."
5,Maravilloso,I saw this movie while studying abroad in Uruguay five years ago and haven't been able to forget it. A story of a simple journey made marvelous by the eyes seeing it and the feet walking it. Worth the price!
1,"KILLER ""SODIUM/SALT"" ; WAY OVER THE TOP","THE NUTRITIONAL LABEL IS ""VAGUE/MISLEADING"" ; 6 pieces = 860mg SALT/SODIUM= ""OUTRAGIOUS/UNACCEPTABLE"" TOTALLY MEDEVIAL ; THIS IS THE 21ST.

2,Cracked,"I thought the table looked cheap, but then again, it was cheap so I could live with that. I did not like the espresso color. It was too dark but the reason I am writing this review is b/c soon after I assembled it, I saw a crack on one side of the table. Length of crack is about 4 to 5 inches from one edge going towards middle of table. I looked underneath the table. The crack goes all the way to the bottom. I don't know if the crack had been there all along or if it suddenly developed after I assembled it. I do NOT recommend this product."
2,Disappointed,"Expected her usual great DVD's but this one is way too short. The idea for slow workout with weights is good, just not enough of a good thing."
1,DO NOT TOUCH THIS ITEM,"I purchased this item a week ago and it is nothing but a big disapointment. I purchased it for controlling my bike speaker set attached to my ipod nano 2nd generation. The item's spec states that it fits ipod nano and that it has A 30 feet range - even ""through walls"". In reality it does not fit the Nano. I had to disassamble the unit and take out the inside from the fixture of the device and attach it to my Nano - still does not work properly - either does not respond, or shifts volume to either minimum or maximum after you touch it - in short - THIS IS A BAD PRODUCT AND I WASTED MY MONEY."
5,A Great Movie!,I remember seeing this a long time ago as a teenager and have always remembered it. I went to see it because of the music being by Paul McCartney but I remember it being a great movie! I look forward to seeing it again now that I have found it on DVD.
4,good film,"If you like Hayley Mills you will enjoy this movie, It's one of her lesser known roles and you will find it very enjoyable."
2,bulletproof asset protection,"Clear charts, easy chapters, convincing arguments - yet not enough info on ""how to""...I'm not sure that it is really necessary to complicate matters as much as he does. This book is mainly self-advertising and is clearly geared to very wealthy potential clients."
5,"This book is comprehensive, succinct and easy to read.","I liked this book because it gave me the hard information I needed without a lot of unnecessary fluff. It described precisely how these things work, and especially how they work when you get sued. Very comprehensive, yet succinct. Very efficient read. It was also understandable; no legalese, and every time the author used a legal term, he explained it in clear English. I didn't know anything about these things when I started and I feel like I understand them pretty well now."
3,great tea,I love this yea. It is so expensive however. For 18 bags /: but its good tea & im gifting it to a person who absolutely loves it.
5,Sweet!,"Great tea, in fact, this tea was what sparked my interest in green tea, it's very nice!I respect that this tea is organic, and care was taken in production of the tea.Price is fair"
5,Another of my favorite films ...,"The critics didn't seem to like this film. What's not to like? You've got Meryl Streep, Rober DeNiro, Harvey Keitel in a romance about two married people who accidentally fall in love with each other to the dismay of their married partners. It's a serious film, not a comedy, and played with a deep resonance to what makes our hearts come alive."
3,falling in love,"I like the people in the movie, It has a happy ending, but getting there is many times just slow. Its a good movie, but you really have to want to stick with it. I recommend it for a rainy afternoon, when you're on a movie marathon."
2,Thought it would never end,"This movie was very slow moving, thought it would never end. Also was depressing as it was about breaking up a nice family for ""love"". I don't recommend spending your time watching this movie. There are many better ones to watch."
2,Adultry,"Had I know that it was about two married people falling in love, I would have never chosen to watch it."
2,The Editor was VERY hungry!!,"Meryl and Robert are excellent in this film and do the best they can with what they're given.... which leads to the MAJOR complaint.... editing or obscure screenplay? We see how Roberts wife finds out/reacts, but never how Meryls husband does/reacts. We must read between the lines to find out Meryl is free also near the end when they meet again, but never sure if she's seperated or divorced! At one point, it almosts sounds like she's going to say ""seperated"" but doesn't. Even the end is a let-down! View from a rental store and save your money for ""She-devil""or ""The French Lieutenants Woman"" for a Meryl fix. Even ""Death Becomes Her"" was better than this ""decide for yourself what happens off camera"" tripe."
5,Just wonderful.,"This film apparently went completely un-noticed at the time it was made. To watch it now obviously done early in their careers is such a confirmation of their amazing talent (both Robert DeNiro and Meryl Street). Their ability to ""inhabit"" the characters is truly miraculous. So much is communicated by them to each other with few words that it is absolutely fascinating.As artists they both seem to know each other so well and ""play off"" of one another with such ""ease"" that it is truly unbelievable that they didn't make more films together.Everytime I watch this film and it has been many; I am completely caught up in it again like I'm seeing it for the first time. That's why it's a complete ""treasure"" for anyone's DVD library."
2,Not much to it,"The viewers (if they can even care) are left to suppose why passing strangers allow themselves to follow through on an attraction to each other even though they have apparently loving marriages to very nice, supporting people. Maybe it's the influence of society as portrayed by their best friends who are casually unfaithful to their own spouses. Maybe they want a thrill.Streep and DeNiro are portrayed as having happy marriages until they start thinking about the stranger from the book store. Why? And what is it they have seen in each other when they're in love? There is no depth portrayed in their relationship, yet we're supposed to believe it's love? They aren't teenagers who can be excused in seeing a monumental love in a returned admiring glance. No sale here.I gave it two stars for the sake of the acting and filming, but took three stars away because there was nothing there."
3,A wrong choice,"I personally love Meryl Streep and find her the best actress alive but this movie, in my opinion, fell flat and was far from my high expectations. I do not think that it was really the acting that was what made this movie in my opinion boring it was that this plot has been done to death from any and every angle a man and a woman fall in love but both are already married or one is married or one is married and gets caught. Sound familiar? So I say if you want a good Meryl Streep romance watch Out of Africa or The Bridges of Madison County."
1,A complete waste of time,"I think Streep and DeNiro are actually ashamed to be in this stupid movie it is so beneath their abilities. When the music starts to play get ready for the implausable. It happens over and over and over and over...well, you get the picture."
1,did not like it,"i love both the actors in this movie, but somehow did not care for them cheating, whether happy or not happy in their marriages. that's just how i am."
2,Content stinks,I can't support a storyline that encourages marital infidelity! Only watched about the first 20 minutes and I'd seen enough
2,good acting is the only up side,"I gave the movie 2 stars because of DeNiro & Streep. Had it been any other actors, I would have turned it off.DeNiro's character was a happy man with a good marriage and children he adored. There was no motivation for him to stray, and there was no excuse for him doing so."
3,nice sweet movie,it was sort of slow and sweet and 80's. I am not sure I like that both characters were married and not committed to those relationships.
3,Its ok,Just ok in my opinion. Like both Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro so they were actually my draw. Well acted by not a great movie.
2,He's No Troon McAllister!,"Pardon the pun, but the book is simply not up to par. The author tries TOO hard and the laughs fall flat, in my humble opinion. If you want solid golf fiction, shoot for The Green or The Foursome by McAllister."
3,"Not bad - bit too much of the ""mystical""","Quick read - bit like ""Golf in the Kingdom's"" Seamus heads to the states - channels Bobby Jones and helps a lost soul.... I enjoyed the last scene - but am a sucker for a happy ending!"
3,Zipper Rip-off,"I purchased this bag to simplify my 2 hour air commute. I am able to easily carry my laptop, files and several personal items easily. The bag fits in the overhead bin without question on every aircraft but the RJ's.The flaw; the zippers are of inferior quality. After only two trips the side water-bottle zipper jammed and is now worthless. I would have returned the bag but the 3rd party reseller makes it a diffcult process."
3,A great textbook for Crawford Slip Method,"Dettmer does it again: makes a concept ""come alive"" in plain english. Most managers have used this method without knowing the formal process from ""A to Z."" This would make a great textbook for student or professional. Great follow up to Dettmer's ""Strategic Navigation"" book."
4,Data Structures,"good if you need this book for class, i personally think this is a lot of money for a paperback book. but the author is clear enough and gives useful examples."
1,"Too much fluff, not enough stuff","I am using this book for a introductory course in Data Structures. It wastes far too many pages on specifications of ADT's. There are pages upon pages of data structure specifications, and very little on showing how they can be used in a real program. There are much better books out there. I like Data structures & algorithms by Robert Lafore. Lafore gives example programs that use the data structure being taught. To me, the specifications are utterly useless. I had to buy a supplemental book to finish my course, as my professor was bad, too. Look elsewhere, there are better books."
5,Very Good Book,"So far this is the most clearly written and easily understood Computer Science text book that I have come across and used in a class. With most of the attention paid toward ADT's, our class not only learned them, but also the Java programming language on top of it! I highly recommend this book. Little if any bugs too!"
2,"bah, there are better books than this, dude","I have read several books on data structures (3). And in my opinion this is the worst of the lot. I have run into bugs, and if you buy this book you should go to the authors website so he can point them out for you. I had a great deal of trouble with this author's sample code, this is the main reason I did not like this book. Remember to include all his damn packages, when trying to compile his code, of course you have to get them from his website. buy a data structures book by Wiess or standish. Warning: the sample code in this book is overly confusing, and is clearer in other books."
2,80's genre,"Not as good as I thought. I could not afford the other two albums, so I decided to go with the compilation because of the 2 songs found on You Tube that I thought were fantastic. Maybe 3 songs at best (thats including my 2 favorites)on this album. I love the 80's Glam Metal, Hard Rock, Prog. etc. so I have a good ear for what you may think Stone Fury may have to offer. Lenny Wolf's voice is excellent, however, the band sounds like Led Zeppelin meets Duran Duran...need I say more? I am not going to buy any more Stone Fury."
5,Great Intro CD,"I've became familiar with Clara Hill via Jazzanova, my favorite nujazz/brokenbeat group. Both Jazzanova and Clara Hill are based in Germany. This is good music you will never hear on mainstream American radio. It's positive and I dig the vibes. I look forward to more from Jazzanova and Clara Hill"
3,"Interesting in parts,other times a disappointment","I just picked up this book today,after eagerly awaiting it. It is worth reading, but if you are a fan of his older material (""Her"",""European Poems & Transitions"",""Coney Island of the Mind"",etc. etc.) it is somewhat of a disappointment. Also,a few of these poems aren't all that 'new' per se. There is one where he wrote, ""Ginsberg died 49 nights ago"" and well, Ginsberg has been dead for four years now. There are a few memorable,beautifully lyrical lines...""Your heart in a flower pales the dawn"" from, 'First, the News'. Other poems are funny in parts...""You don't get in free, & there's no chicken soup, and this ain't no Frank O'Hara lunch poem"". Sadly though, for the most part this book is somewhat unmemorable."
4,Cute but smaller than expected,I already had a large one that matches this and expected them to be the same size but this one is a little bit smaller. It is still very attractive and good quality.
4,"Once again, Snazzy!",Y do I have to keep writing soooo much about this crap? Done with these reviews! Ugh jed fndjch udj
5,helpful,I would say it's a very helpful addition to Öne Year Bible. Would suggest buying it as a companion to use.
2,No (TOC) Table of Contents,"Why Amazon would sell a book like this for $10 bucks without an active table of contents is beyond me. I got this book yesterday and had to flip through it to the correct date simply because there is no table of contents to navigate with. Believe me it took forever!The content is not all that great either. Each day has a reading from the OT, the NT, Psalms and Proverbs. Yet this book often only comments on 1 or two readings.My advice, save your money. There are a LOT of better organized kindle books out there to study the bible with.I hate being misled. Amazon should have warned us ahead of time that the book has no table of contents to navigate with. Had I known that, I would have not bought the book."
2,"Biased in favor of just one, very limited, interpretation of Scripture","I wish I hadn't bought this. I find the ""answers"" based completely on a material world-view and narrow, literal interpretation of Scripture. This is the view based on the Genesis 2 second account of creation (Adam/Eve) as opposed to the first, and completely opposite, account of creation in Genesis 1, where God (Spirit) creates man (i.e. all individuals) in His image and likeness."
4,New Insight,"The Companion Bible has offered insight into a lot of areas where I have had questions. It offers other chapters from the Bible that go along with what you are currently reading. The only problem I have with it is that about two weeks into it, the verses in my One Year Bible do not match the verses in the Companion Bible."
2,More commentary than study guide,"I was looking for more questions about the text and less commentary. It has been somewhat useful, but I was hoping for more"
2,Not as much as I'd hoped for,"Many of the ""answers"" in this Q&A-format; book are gleaned verbatim from the footnotes in the Life Application Study Bible, so if you have one of those, that's strike one. On the plus side, I don't think you can get a One Year Life Application Bible (yet), so this is a good way to put some of the content of that Bible into the One Year format.Strike two is that there are only 2-4 questions for each day's reading, which means that there often isn't even one question per reading (OT, NT, Psalm, Proverb). And often they aren't exactly the ""deepest"" questions, either. On the plus side, this brevity keeps the book smaller.If you're really into the Q&A; thing, I recommend a Quest Study Bible -- a cool product with tons of good questions in the margins, great for study, devotion, or impromptu discussion/teaching. Or else you can use the One Year Bible blog to supplement your daily reading. Otherwise, just stick to your One Year Bible and let God's Word do its work."
3,A good start,"The One Year Bible Companion is a good start for bible study. It is very brief, however, and many daily readings need more than its one page format. I often go to other texts in order to get more historical detail, and more importantly to seek the scriptures' meaning in my daily life."
4,Add to your daily Bible reading time ...,"The One Year Bible Companion is a useful guide for any One Year Bible daily reading program. It provides simple answers to common questions pertaining to Bible customs, words, and persons that are often unfamiliar to contemporary readers. It is not a detailed commentary but does provide insight and is conveniently dated for each day's readings. Readers who do not have a One Year Bible can follow the scriptural references in the Companion to locate the daily readings. I have found it a very helpful and enjoyable supplement to my daily Bible reading."
2,bad clasp,I have arthritis in my knees and this ankle bracelet has helped. My only complaint is that the clasp does not stay closed and I have to tape it with duct tape to keep it on my ankle.
3,Reality but defective in some aspects,"The book has a very attractive and rather unkown subject. The analysis of different diseases and interactions between social powers, religion and the emergence of diseases is very interesting. But the information given about the Eastern and Islamic world is confined to Egypt. The author makes comments only relying on the Egyptian data and this is rather weak. But as a whole the book gives very useful information and shows that all these medical advances now and in history are not so innocent as in most cases economic concerns suppress humanity."
1,not what I expected...at all!!!,"These cut-outs are flimsy and quite small...The house is only about an inch high and the elephant is less than 1 1/2 inches long, including the trunk....They don't cost much but they aren't worth the money!"
1,Ripoff,"They are not as good-looking as what you see in the photograph. Expensive when you bought, cheap to use. I'll never buy this again."
4,Niece loves it!,My little niece had lots of playdough but wasn't interested in it at all until I gave her these. Now she can have lots of fun with her mommy.
1,Lousy,"Very poor quality copy - so dark it is impossible to tell what color the horse is. We live in Carbondale, where this was shot, so ordered it for our cowboy-loving grandson. What a disappointment!"
5,One of the best CDs I've bought in months,"Bought this on an impulse and really like it. I'm a longtime fan of Western Swing and other classic country music, but I still found unfamiliar gems on this CD. My two favorites are ""Don't Be Ashamed of Your Age"" and ""It's All Your Fault"", but there are many other great songs here. As an added bonus, the musicianship on this CD is stellar. I knew Johnny Gimble and Buddy Emmons set the bar for swing on their respective instruments (fiddle and steel), but who knew relative youngster Brent Mason could go Eldon Shamblin's guitar playing one better? Shouldn't have been surprised. Mason's a phee-nom. Oh, and Willie sounds great too! This one's a keeper."
4,must have for any Willie fan,"great collection of honky-tonk and Western swing--quite hokey and dated, but loveable and every track a gem. Easy listening for working in the garage or drinking beer on the porch. Buy it!"
3,Disapointed,"Deeply disapointed in the sound quality. Perhaps they are pushing volume over quality, but something has changed. the last two years."
3,"Wonderful Story, Poorly Told","What a wonderful, engaging story about the 20th Century's most remarkable public figure. Imagine: a war correspondent who brazenly leads his comrades out of an ambush, only to bravely return -- unarmed -- in a futile effort save more of his trapped colleagues. Captured, he plots and executes a daring escape -- succeeding where professional soldiers cannot. His hunger for adventure not yet sated, he returns to the battle field, knowing full well that his re-capture will mean certain death.They just don't make leaders like this any more!The downside in this book -- considerable in my opinion -- is the poor (I've elected a charitable adjective) quality of the writing. Ms. Sandys would definitely have been well served by having a professional writer as her collaborator."
2,Sense of Entitlement and Arrogance,"This is the first book that I have ever read about Churchill, so I was very surprised to read example after example of his arrogance and his ""at all times"" sense of entitlement. His granddaughter (an obviously biased author) recited many of Churchill's actions during the Boer War as examples of his bravery and courage. I, however, interpreted these actions in quite a different manner. One example of Churchill's ""bravery"" was when his train was ambushed by Boer troops. The author described his behavior as brave and heroic, whereas I viewed his actions as a very calculated tactic for self-advacement. In fact, it was Churchill's fault that the train went so far into Boer territory in the first place--he wanted more information for his newspaper, and his subsequent actions only put the British troops in more danger. The book was also not well written or organized; it reminded me of reading a high school book report."
1,RUBBISH! WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!,"As an English woman, I was insulted by the way this ""writer"" tries to write about an English character living in the UK. Put it this way, this book was so badly written, under researched and pathetic that I couldn't read more than a quarter of it. Example#1: English people do not say things like ""Gee!"" #2: We do not have bridal showers nor baby showers, nor do we refer to nappies as diapers. We do not go to an endo when we are pregnant. #3 We do NOT say things like ""Us Brits...""Do us a favor and at least do a bit of research next time you try to write a book set in the UK."
5,"Witty, sly and subversive","The Thin Pink LIne starts with a very clever premise, and delivers. The ""pregos"" get all the attention. But what about a woman who thought she was pregnant, liked the way people react to such, and wanted it to stay that way? Enter Jane. She pretends she is pregnant and likes the attention. But how long can a person keep up such a farce? Of course, when first we practice to conceive...I mean, deceive...as she has to keep up the myth, the book gets funnier and funnier. She can't drink, and she has to show people a sonogram, so she tries to buy one off the pregos. Hysterical. Can't wait for more from the author."
2,Okay,"The basis for the story is good and I read the entire book because I wanted to find out what happened. The massive amounts of spelling errors and no scene breaks, really take away from the story. I had to reread several sentences every time a scene changed in order to figure out what was going on because it jumped from one scene to an entirely different scene in the very next paragraph with no indication you were leaving a scene behind. This book comes across as though it's a first draft. A little tightening up and this really could be a hit. I found it ironic that the main character is an editor. For the most part a decent story, if you can look beyond the errors and many of the information dumps that aren't necessary for the story. I did a lot of skimming on those."
1,Terrible!,"Do not waste your time buying this book or even borrowing it from the library. It was a terrible! The plot sounds so interesting at the start, but goes nowhere. The author is so boring, she even goes about describing the ""cleaning process before painting"" for 2 whole pages while the main character paints her bedroom-what??? Worst book by far that I've ever read, and because of that, this is the first book I've ever taken the time to write a review about. Don't waste a minute of your life on it. I've already wasted mine, and want to warn anyone who will listen."
4,Fun to Read,The pink line is a quirky book that I just couldnt put down. The character was so funny I just couldnt wait to see what she was going to do next. Honestly ladies this is afun book to read!!!
1,Totally Unbelieveable,"The storyline is so fake and unbelieveable. The main character, Jane, is so swallow and portrays pregnancy pitifully. Nobody likes her and in this book why would they? I kept reading to see how it ended, how she had to tell the truth and guess what the ending was just down right more unbelieveable than the rest of the story and the ending was extremely poor. It was hard to keep my attention in the beginning and by the end all I had to say was ""don't waste your time reading this book or money buying this book."""
1,sooooo bad,"this book is horrible.the worst chick lit I've ever read. actually, the worst book I've ever read of any genre, and I've read a lot of terrible books.the plot, the characters, the way it's written. all of it, just awful.how did this even get published?"
1,Big Disappointment,"The run on sentences were unbearable, I skimmed through the rest of the book after the second page. Even skimming through was torture, I was hoping for a good ending to making in worth it. No such luck. Very disappointing."
1,Save a tree - don't buy this book,Thankfully I checked it out from the library but even then I felt guilty that my taxpayers money was used to purchase this. Horrible book. I skimmed the first chapter and read the last page (and a few others) and am so happy I didn't waste my time. One of the worst books I've skimmed ever.
1,Simply Awful,"The heroine of this book, Jane Taylor, has the most reprehensible morals imaginable. I thought the premise of the book was really clever and that it would prove to be quite funny, but I was disappointed. During Jane's ""pregnancy,"" she gets sympathy for conditions she doesn't have, plays with the emotions of both friends and family, accepts gifts for her imaginary baby without a second thought, and walks away from the love of her life because she is too immature to finally fess up to her charade. Finally, the end of the book is supremely ridiculous and a lovely example of deus ex machina.There are more problems with the book then the ones listed above (trying to trap a man into marriage, improbable reactions from other characters to Jane's insanity), but many of them would constitute spoilers. Overall, I do not recommend The Thin Pink Line."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this book along with others. I finished the first 2 books, in 2 days, which were great (Running With Scissors and The Dogs of Babel). Then I got to this book, I find the writing style annoying. There's a lot of unnecessary run on's that is making it impossible to enjoy. There's a lot of pointless information-at least that's how I feel. The other 2 titles are such great books, I recommend them."
1,A Sad Disappointment,"I hoped this book would be a light summer read, but I was sadly disappointed. The protagonist's lack of intelligence and over-the-top selfishness made this book impossible to finish. The plot is contrived and can be summed up as an unfortunate attempt to imitate Bridget Jones's Diary, only these charcters are even more unrealistic and boring. I actually wanted to like this book, but I felt compelled to put it down after 100 pages."
1,One of the worst red dress ink books out there,I was so disappointed in this book. I have enjoyed most of these books but this one had no redeeming qualities. The main character is so shallow and unlikable (by her co-workers and even her own mother!). I finished it in the hopes it would get better but not so. Don't waste your time on this one.
3,Don't Waste Your Time and $$,"I picked this book up thinking it was going to be a quick beach read that would be over quickly. Not the case!!Although the plot of the story is very intriguing (girl has problems w/ boyfriend, tells boyfriend she might be pregnant, girl finds out she is not preganant yet still keeps up the charade in hopes of keeping her boyfriend around yada yada yada) it falls flat early on.This book had a very boring intro. and although it became ""okay"" after the first 120 pages, I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Ready for Some Serious Book Throwing?,"OK, so this is my first ever Chick Lit novel. Yes, I was forced to read it by my Women and Literature instructor, but after choosing Lauren Baratz-Logsted's The Thin Pink Line, I am now a new fan of this new genre. The best part of this novel is that Jane gets to do what many women wish they could do- She lives out her fantasies in real life. Wacky as they may be, she gets to do it and we don't. This book is not whimsical, breezy, witty (yadda, yadda, yadda)- it is a great read with laugh-out-loud humor. Any woman who has been pregnant will nearly pee from laughing at the bumbling Jane does through her ""pregnancy"" (Obviously she's never really tried to eat curry as a pregnant lady- the heartburn would have killed her!)[...]Definately worth the time and if you're a new-comer to the genre, this is a perfect choice for a first book. You'll start being shocked on the first page and it won't end until you first throw the book across the room!"
5,A Must-Read for Moms,"Anyone who has gone through a pregnancy will appreciate the subtle, situational humor of this book. It's light reading, but it's not for dummies. Jane Taylor is this sort of Seinfeld-meets-Bridget Jones character whom you'll cringe over, while at the same time cheering her on. I read this as a book club pick, and found myself looking forward to it each night, right through the wincingly ""Hollywood"" (yet perfectly appropriate) ending."
4,The Thin Pink Line,"I almost gave up on this book after the first page. It immediately sounded like a Bridget Jones clone, and I wasn't really in the mood for that (for instance, her gay best friend, the snipy women at work, the hard-to-believe sexual harrassment at her workplace...). However, I decided to stick it out and I am glad I did. Jane's character is fascinating and beautiful in her own flawed way. I was a little disappointed in the ending, which was rather sudden and somewhat trite, and left far too many loose ends for my tastes. But other than that, an enjoyable read."
3,Okay But Rather Unrealistic,"Lauren Baratz-Logsted is a very good writer. Her ""voice"" is clear and Jane is a well-developed character with whom the reader can relate. However, the storyline bothered me almost from the start. Why in the world would someone want to go through this?The end is just too pat and there are many questions left unanswered. What happened with Mona Shakespeare (the author from New York)? If the author had concluded the book a little more satisfactorily, I would have given her another star.Still, it was an enjoyable read and I guess that's what's important!"
1,"Reading this book was a ""labor"" itself.","When I picked up this book, the plot seemed interesting. Quite similar to Lindsey Lohan's ABCfamily film ""Labor Pains"". If you have a choice between the two, choose the movie. Her acting is kinda bad, but its much more entertaining to see Lohan preggo, than reading this book.I could barely get through a sitting of the book. After 10 minutes I'd get bored. I found myself skipping paragraphs of mindless details, trying to find parts that actually pertain to the plot. I mean, I don't really care if the heroine's co-worker is obsessed with making copies at the copy machine, 2 paragraphs about it was ridiculous.Usually I love date scenes in a book, but found Jane and Tolkien's romance very very dry.I got really irritated with Jane herself, too many paragraphs about how skinny and in shape her body is. She seemed very dumb too, making up all these facts about pregnancy, and acting like a know-it-all.I don't recommend wasting your time on this book."
5,Not At All What I Expected,"I picked up The Thin Pink Line expecting to mildly entertained; instead, I laughed so hard I cried...and I even cried a little for Jane. I surprised myself by liking Jane, who seems to try very hard not be liked. There's a lot to be said for a woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it, and a little to be learned from her as well. What a refreshing change from all the 'please somebody give me what I want' PinkBooks on the shelves. Three cheers for Jane (and for her creator). I'm glad we're going to have the chance to hear some more of her story!"
4,Lots of fun here,"This book is chick lit with a twist. It is perfect for summer reading on the beach, travel reading on a plane, or winter reading in a big chair by a fireplace. The characters are funny, and surprisingly true to life. The heroine, Jane, is at a crossroads and tries a traditional way to hold on to her man. She pretends to be pregnant.The intriguing twist in the plot is that her plan affects Jane more than anyone else. Potential motherhood becomes her. She often forgets that she isn't really pregnant. In the course of her ""pregnancy"", she begins to grow up.The story is very clever, well-written, and often extremely funny."
5,"Not The Kind of Book I Usually Read, But...","This is not the sort of book I usually read, but I picked it up after buying my wife both The Thin Pink Line and Crossing the Line. She was so engrossed in TPL that, after she finished it, I picked it up and read a few lines. That turned into a few pages, and then a few chapters. I really needed to find out what would happen with Jane, and with the baby, and with Tolkein. And I wasn't disappointed.I'm starting on Crossing the Line next and I hope the Lauren Baratz-Logsted comes out with some more books soon. Like I said, this isn't the kind of book I'd normally read, but it was really enjoyable and I'd reccommend it highly."
2,Tends to drag a little,"I was excited about this book because Red Dress has come out with a lot of really fun single something books.There was just something about this one that I couldn't get past. The concept is fun, the dialogue is witty. But I think part of the problem is that there isn't enough of it. Too much of the book is Jane's thoughts, and this wouldn't be so bad if she wasn't so hyper in her thinking. Rather than humorous, Jane just comes off anxious. Her anxiety was seriously making me anxious as I was reading, and I think paragraph after paragraph of her thoughts tended to just bog down the story. It was just too much. I think this was why I kept skimming the paragraphs of Jane's thoughts (which in some cases was pages).If you want a single-something story with witty dialogue AND hilarious thoughts (but not overly anxious ones!) I would recommend ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" by Sophie Kinsella, or ""Watermelon"" by Marian Keyes."
2,Needs serious editing,"This book is formatted as if written by a teenager, with many random thoughts and no transition to the next scene. Needs serious editing before it could be considered a good read. I had expected to like it based on the description but there is no way to get past the multiple errors and lack of chapters/transition marks."
2,Annoying,I read this book and thought the character was annoying and the plot pretty unrealistic. I didn't like her at all.
1,awful!,"I love chick lit books, but this is literally the worst book I have ever read. Clearly the character is supposed to be the next Becky Bloomwood, but the author falls far short. The writing is horrendous (did no one edit or spellcheck?), and there are random characters and plotlines that are so undeveloped that as a reader, you just don't care. I stuck with it just to see how the main character would work her way out of this ridiculous fake pregnnancy (so, so stupid; in the hands of another writer, this would have worked, but Jane is so poorly written that you are just waiting for the whole thing to end),, and was unsurprisingly dissapointed with that as well. Seriously, I have never written a review before, but felt compelled to warn others. Stay far, far away."
1,Definately not a winner,"I started reading this book because I found the plot amusing...but the middle seems to really drag, and the end is down right AWFUL. As an American, I kept reading this book and wondering, ""are the English REALLY this nuts?!?!""I'm also really sick of every book I pick up being set in London with the heroine working for a publishing house. Is that all they do?!If you are really intrigued by this book, read a few chapters and skip to the end.About the only thing that really made me want to stand up and cheer through the entire book was when Christopher put Jane in her place. He and David were my favorite characters."
2,Not What I Expected...,"When I read the description of this book I thought it sounded like a really interesting idea. Unfortunately, I wasn't thrilled at all with the book as I read it. First of all, I wanted to strangle the main character. I don't know why she didn't come clean with certain people in the book (I don't want to give it away for anyone that wants to read the book). I found the main character to be annoying. The ending left me hanging; which really annoyed me. The only thing that I really enjoyed in the book was her friend David. He was really a great guy. I wish there could have been more about him in the book rather than her."
4,Lots of fun for a non-chick lit reader,"This book is lots of fun. Not a big Bridget Jones fan, I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. But Jane's voice is so funny and so honest that I was totally won over.The narrative is compelling enough so that even though when the tale gets gets zany, it never descends iinto a flat farce. And the ending is well, magical in a most satisfying wayBargatz-Logsted writes with a light touch and easy humour, displaying great compassion for even her most minor or self-centered characters."
1,Horrible!,I was so frustrated reading this book. The main character has no redeeming qualities at all. She is completely unlikeable and her behavior is ridiculous. I found the ending (without giving it away)to be extremely contrived. I do not recommend this book at all.
5,Great fun to read,"This book is quirky, original, odd, funny and unpredictable. I had a great deal of fun reading this book. The protagonist is exasperating in the extreme, but one finds one's self cheering her on. Albeit sometimes reluctantly. Her supporting cast of friends and colleagues are interesting and well written. This is a good, enjoyable, off beat book to share with a friend."
1,Horrible Book,"I'd like to say that anyone who has ever tried to get pregnant would be offended by this book, but since this book was given to me by a friend from my son's playgroup, I guess I can't generalize. I didn't find the premise of this book funny at all. I thought it was a stretch and the prose annoying and simplistic. I dreaded picking it up to finish it. And I feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it out of my garbage can to read!"
2,well-written with a terrible story..,"i NEVER feel strongly enough about chick lit books to review them, but this book brought out some strong feelings in me. yes it's a bit witty, and well-written. but the protagonist is SO ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING that it's difficult to get through the book. she's a terrible cariacature of a decent person, and i worry that the author actually thought people might find her sympathetic. i kept waiting for something to happen to turn it around but unbelievably, the ending is worse than the rest of the book. don't waste your time."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I'm sure the author met well, but I found this book unreadable. Halfway through the book I realized I was still waiting for the funny part. That's when I abandoned hope, read the last few pages, and was glad I gave it up when I did.I never for one moment believed that Jane was English. The constant references to America and Americans became quite annoying and obvious after awhile. (""I'm no Yank, I reckon I'm quite British--right then, yes, er, British."") We were even treated to a bit about a British author trying and failing to write with an authentic American voice. Now *that* was subtle."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"I absolutely loved Thin Pink Line. I thought it was a laugh out loud, well-written, extremely clever summer read! The dialog is hilarious, and is so extremely well written you can actually picture every scene as it unfolds. One scene that particularly made me LOL was Jane's luncheon with her mother, discussing the naming of her ""child"". -True, in the beginning, Jane is not the most likeable character; but I for one actually liked her.....I saw through her catty, annoying, lying, self-righteous, self absorbed facade. I enjoyed watching her evolve and could not wait to see her next antic. Baratz-Logsted wrote a very funny story, one that cannot be compared to....very inventive! - I can see it as a movie."
1,Hated it,"I thought this book was completely unrealistic. This girl is obviously a delusional psychopath and in the end, she gets something that in the beginning, she didn't neccessarily want. It's a pretty big something and she's a pretty big whack job for it to be granted so lightly. I hated this book. It gives men a reason to make fun of chic books."
3,So So on the Facts,"I rented the video as a test before buying for my grandaughter; I'm glad that I did. It's ok for a one off viewing, but perhaps not worth the cost of full purchase. There are several instances where they do not have the correct dates, and the mistake which stands out most to me is the place in the video where they are discussing the wedding dress. While spectulating as to who the designer might be; they draw comparisons between the styles of the Duchess; and Diana, Princess of Wales; even highlighting hers from 1981. They mention Elizabeth Emanuel; but not her former husband David, who did much of the design himself, and when it is time to interview Elizabeth, the name ""Charlotte Todd - Designer"" appears on the screen and not that of her own name. Nice footage of Diana, and early interviews with William during his Gap year; but I wouldn't recommend it for purchase."
1,Disappointing,This movie is really disappointing. There is hardly any information about their relationship. It is mostly boring video with no talking. You can get more information about the couple by watching the Lifetime videos on Hulu for free. Don't waste your money.
2,Guilty of being tacky and terrible,"Judge Bill Gibron, DVD Verdict -- ""As an already pointless relic of a country eager to celebrate something special, this is a ridiculous rip-off contained within an impossible to deny desperation by the British citizenry for anything William and Kate related. At only 45 minutes (with an additional 10 of already viewed Q&A material from the presentation itself as a ""bonus feature""), it's a pointless entertainment endeavor. It's just a cobbled-together collection of editorial tidbits hastily fastened to a fiasco of an explanation. Sure, William and Kate look good, and they come off as cool and confident. Just wait until after the pomp and circumstance. That's when the British press will really take the gloves off and start swinging. For now, they're playing pleasant, even if Prince William and Kate: The Royal Romance is more noxious than nice."" You can read the full review at [...]"
5,TECHNICALITY: FAULT & DEFAULT,"the technique and the time of Bernard Stiegler propose a philosophical analysis of technicality. Stiegler shows that this one is originating. If the Western culture analyzed the technique like a fault (Promotheus), it must now be seen like a defect, the defect even of the originating one. Heir to Derrida, of which he was the pupil, Stiegler starts a turning in the philosophical analysis of the destiny of the technique."
3,Retriever Book,"The book arrived promptly, but smelled very musty. It does contain good information about the breed and is recommended reading for anyone who owns or is thinking of being owned by a golden."
4,True Love,"This was a nice book.However,I did find it odd for African American women/sisters tobe nvoved with same man.But,it did turn out ok! Since,the two sisters really did not know each other.It gives some insight on how candidates and othewr staffers work to raise public eye."
4,Gaither Homecoming,I enjoy this particular CD since some of the vocalists are no longer living. The Homecoming format is one I particularly enjoy.
1,Nerver received it,"I have paid for a product that I have never received and I am very upset about it, understandably. I am hoping/waiting for a replacment or refund!"
4,Sander Vs. Golden,"I take issue with the reviewer who says that Steve ruined this. It is a great recording, and I have to say that Steve and Golden are very different and should not be compared. But if we're comparing lets do it. Steve was an awesome vocalist, who brought a new sound and energy to the group when it was desperately needed. He didn't sing through his nose like Golden does, he sang on key (which Golden often does not) and was glad to be there (unlike Golden the last few years of his first run.)Now to the review. Top picks are Gonna Take A Lot Of River, Too Many Heartaches, Bridges and Walls, and When Karen Comes Around."
1,Oak Ridge Boys ruin by Steve Sanders singing!,A poor album by the Oaks. Steve Sanders is no where near the singer that William Lee Golden was. The other three Oaks still know how to do it though. If Steve Sander wasn't on the album it would be worth buying. Thank God that the Real Oak Ridge Boys are back together now!
5,Absolutely Great!,I bought this mouthpiece for my son who has been playing for about a year and is really into it. The difference in the sound from his Yamaha was amazing. It is really true that mouthpiece makes a difference no matter what instrument you have. The sound is much warmer and richer. It does have more of a tendency to sound flat when he is getting tired. I would definitely recommend this mouthpiece for anyone interested in improving their sound.
5,Sounds better,"I'm not a Sax player but my daughter does sound better with the C star. At first she could only play half the notes well with it, but after a lesson with it and a week of practice, she can play all the way to F sharp. She uses it on a Yamha 475, which also helped the sound improve from a Bundy. Use it with a good reed or results will vary."
3,Not as good as the other reviews would indicate,"I picked this up based on other reviews. I have read dozens of books on this topic as I am a consultant and trainer in this field and this book is just average. If you are looking for a primer on an end to end process, perhaps this is decent for that. If you are a practitioner that has some experience in this process, you may also find some interesting sections to learn from, but you will have to dig a bit.To be fair, finding a good book on this topic is elusive, but one I use in my classes is Managing Software Requirements - A Use Case Approach by Leffingwell and Widrig."
4,Good primer on product development,"A thorough and straight forward primer on developing new products. Where it lacks creativity and a wealth of examples, it provides a solid understanding and approach. Recommended reading, but I would check your local library before shelling out money for this book. A good read but not one that I would necessarily keep on my shelf for future reference."
4,Excellent touchstone,"Every time I get in deep with requirements I stop, catch my breath, and flip through the pages of this book.Practical. Easy to read. Effective. It has helped me numerous times on projects of various sizes and complexity. A definite must-have."
4,Nice Sugar Bowl,It's just what I was looking for and wish I had also ordered the creamer. Nice quality. The only reason that it's 4 star is that it's a little smaller than I had hoped for.
5,Vestal Sings,This is an AWESOME and UPLIFTING CD. For any Southern Gospel or Vestal Goodman fans...this is a must have. Eastern Gate and I will Meet You in the MOrnign are pure Vestal!!
2,False Advertisement!,"I ordered ""The Norton Reader 11th Edition"" by the USBN number. This book was not it. This book is the ""guide"" to it. Nowhere in this profile of the book does it say that this is just the guide. Not only did I wait over a month for this (2 weeks past expected delivery date), but now I have to spend even more money to buy the actual textbook expedited. Thanks. My soon to be F in my online class thanks you."
2,Wrong item,This was not the norton reader... This was the guide to the norton reader which was not acceptable for the college class I was taking... Although I dropped this class to fit another science class it was frustrating to receive the wrong item
3,Not as good as it sounds,"In an attempt to escape the artificial and crazy life of modern life for a more simple way of living, Lawrence Donegan moves from Glasgow, Scotland to Creeslough, Ireland, a small rural community. The book details the year he spent living there, working for the small community newspaper and playing for the local Gaelic football team. Though it sounds like this might be an amusing book about a fish out of water, about a big-city guy adapting to small-town life, it's not really as amusing as it sounds. The author adjusts to his new life and learns the ways of small-town life. Period. And it's not really that entertaining or amusing. There's some funny anecdotes here and there, but not as many as you'd think, and it ultimately took me quite awhile to get through this book."
4,A GREAT BOOK!,"A very interesting book that gets right down to the details about Africa's greatest civilization. It nice to finally read more and more books these days that teaches the history that indigenous Africans created. No more fantasy about some outside imaginary human beings.But it would have been nice if they told the truth about their indigenous name that they called themselves. They never called themselves Egyptians, but called themselves Kamites. The Greeks called them Egyptians thousands of years later. Maybe that will be in the next book."
1,very disapointing,"As a cake decorator I try to buy as many books as I can. As I live in Brazil and we haven't many options here, Amazon helps me A LOT.I bought this book when I saw the cute cover. But inside most of the projects are very unprofessional to my point of view.In a world full of good books to cake decorators of ALL levels, this is one that I do not recomend to anyone."
4,Baja Butterflies-Finally some good information,"This book is vaulable to anyone who has an interest in Leps. No other book covers the Baja California area, and because of the many species that cross the border, it is also a good form of information for Southern California lep people."
3,A Little Dated,"There are lots of tired 1950's devices to punch up the drama, including jarring distorted music (what a modern sound engineer would call ""red lining."") However, there are a couple of very artistic scenes like the girlfriend's unusual dance and the famous ""rain"" scene. I'm afraid the workers and the inmates of the insane asylum seem stiff and boring now. This is that rare story that deserves a remake."
4,"Insanity, Incest, Social Responsability, and... Nymphos!","Like many films from the same time period, Shock Treatment intends to showcase serious and dramatic social/political issues that plague mankind, but attempts to do so in a black-and-white alternate reality of mind-numbingly simplicity. The only thing more shocking than the film's depiction of the mentally ill is it's tail-end of the Hayes Code depiction of ""strippers"". The film is a mixed blessing, however, for despite the inherent and unintended humor in scenes such as the ward full of nymphomaniacs that converge upon a screaming male victim while singing ""My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"", nearly all of the actors involved put forth such a heartfelt and emotionally captivating performance that they make even the most ludicrous dialogue and situations almost believable. Shock Corridor might do for Mental Health what Duck and Cover did for Nuclear Warfare, but it is a film that can be enjoyed on both a serious and camp level with equal success."
4,High Quality DVD -- A must have for Sam Fuller fans,"I like Sam Fuller movies --each one is unique -- some have the big studio backing while most others like Shock Corridor are small films and they're usually very good! Shock Corridor doesn't disappoint. It's classic Sam Fuller. The Black and White cinematography and contrast is superb. The print on the DVD isn't pristine-- you can hear and see some minor defects but the overall quality is excellent. This DVD is by by Criterion (I own several Criterion Laser-Discs -- they are the best) and the packaging is high quality.The cast is from the Sam Fuller casting Mafia -- notably Gene Evans -- the tough Sarge from Fuller's The Steel Helmet. Evans plays one of the many unusual nutcases that you see in this DVD! It has some outrageous dialog and low budget effects that will have you laughing but that's what's fun about watching ""Film Noir"" genre movies."
5,Peter Breck Fan,"This movie is a camp classic, it is funny, though it is notmeant to be. I was actually laughing out loud. It was donein 1963 pre BIG VALLEY days for Peter Breck, but is does showwhat an incredibly good actor he is! And it has the addedattraction on having the lovely Constance Towers who playshis stripper girlfriend. Constance Towers can be seen onGeneral Hospital these days playing the evil Helena Cassidine.The acting from all the actors in this movie is excellent, andI think it looked like they had a lot of fun playing it. Ifanyone wants an example of those B movies they use to show atthe local Drive In theatre then this is the movie that bringsback that Fiftys feel. ENJOY!"
2,Not that great,"It's not olive drab, the reticule doesn't match the literature, it's got a lighted reticle which I didn't want, the switch to operate the lighted reticule is very poor, outer finish mediocre, made in Phillipines. This one is going back, you are better off getting a Leupold when you can catch them on sale."
5,AWESOME BOOK !!!,"I read this book and learned some things about people and how they seem to have a divided heart. The right side of the heart is used to store the Good things and the left side is for BAD things,that they seem to have and are not ready to deal with just yet. I love the writing style of the author. She injects some humor and even tells on her self, then gets to the heavy part of the chapter. I would find myself laugh soooo hard I couldn't breathe then feel at times like crying. I think any one would benefit from reading this book. It could help the reader or help the reader to understand and help other hurting people. I am looking forward to reading more of this authors books and have already passed this book on to a hurting friend."
4,Black Heart,"This is a good book. I like the quotes, especially the one about children. Kinda slow at time, but a good read."
5,Love this.,This book is so helpful when shopping for Belleek. Not only do you get the history of Belleek you get beautiful pictures to compare and identify. The cross reference in the back is indispensable and when used with the price list you can make a reasonable decision on values. Even if you just enjoy looking at it Bellek is quite beautiful and this book does a fine job displaying them.
4,Important reading,"With the current atmosphere, it is more important than ever to try and understand this country's obsession with guns. Mr. Spitzer gives a careful analysis indeed of the past history and 'urban legends' that have resulted in the erroneous belief in our 'wild west' all the way to the present political success and strength of the NRA."
5,Homecoming,This is a good collection of Gaither music. Bill and Gloria Gaither do really good work producing their gospel music.
5,Not your ho hum pasta salad,"Simply the best pasta for a pasta salad in the world. Combine with a light pasta dressing with green olives, kalamada olives, and black olives. Add a smig of fresh basil. It is ready for any special event. Want to impress your friends at a potluck this pasta is the ticket. The pasta is more than a bland foil for a dressing or sause. It has great flavor on its own. Plus Amazon's prices are great."
4,Great untill the very end..,"The book is great. I read it in 2 days and it kept me awake: both for reading and fearing. I liked the plot and the characters although they are a bit too-stereotypical. It kept me up until the end, but I think the end, the 'wrap-up' is a bit far from truth. It could have been a simpler ending, it is just too many coincidences.. But overall, I liked the book and I plan to buy the other books by Jean-Christophe Grange."
5,One of the top five best metal albums ever,"This is the best album by one of metal's greatest bands. The songs range from mosh to total hardcore. ""Fight to Be Free"" is an all-time classic. The lyrics are great. I wore out two cassettes of this album before finding it new on CD a few months ago (I got very, very lucky). If it's back in print, grab it as fast as you can!"
5,awesome,"perfect condition, got it exactly when promised and made my husband very happy. Tortures me with it all the time so I know it's in perfect condition."
2,Nothing Special,"I recently purchased this CD because I am a huge thrash metal fan. I love Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Testament, and Anthrax. And since Nuclear Assault was formed by a former Anthrax bassist, I had to give them a try. Sadly to say, I was disappointed. Yes, this album is thrashy, but there is nothing really special here. No outstanding guitar solo's, no really jaw dropping riffs, its just average speed/thrash metal, with no frills. The vocals arn't great, and overall this is just a blah album. The only thing that got any emotion out of me was the track Got Another Quarter. It made me chuckle. Overall, don't get this CD unless you only live for thrash metal or you grew up with these guys. Nuclear Assault didn't make very many albums. After hearing this, I can see why. Awsome group name though."
3,Too fast for one story.,"Although it does tie up all loose ends from the two previous collections, I felt this, the 3rd and final supplement, moved through the characters later years too fast, rushing towards an end we all assumed would occur one way or another. No spoilers here, but I felt more could have been done, even if it took another 20 comics."
5,Great Story,"This wraps up the Rising Stars story part 17-24 which was delayed for quite a bit of time because of a dispute with the publisher. The 3rd trade wraps up all the loose ends and a nice fashion. The writing is top notch. I like Brent Andersons pencils, but I prefer someone else to ink him. When he does his own, it often looks muddy to me. You can pick up the Visitations trade which collects all the hard to find short tales published. You can also go for the mega hard cover collector's edition which has everyone in one book."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Conflicts between the writer and the company and others lead to yet another comic series being late, and stalled, and everyone lost interest, me included. Finally coming across this, it does seem to be thrown together.Poet, as the last Special, has a destiny, and it involves another planet."
1,Throw up in a cup!!1,"If you can vomit in a cup and then drink it,this is for you.This is the most descusting thing i have ever tried.The instructions say you can mix it with your favorite fruit juice.What they dont say is it floats right to the top and looks just like vomit(believe me it smells like it too).Needless to say it is not worth buying."
1,Did Not Like,Got the Steren Cable Clips for my son who needed to hard wire his computer to out router...FAIL!! These did not work. They are flimsy and the nails bent and even broke while trying to secure the cables. We had to throw these out and use a staple gun. I would not recommend these to anyone. They are awful and was a total waste.
2,Does Not Charge with Canon CB-2LU Charger,"I ordered 2 of these after reading the reviews here. Both of the batteries arrived quickly, fully charged however, when placed in either of my 2 Canon chargers, they were drained. After several attempts to contact Lenmar Technical Support without a response, I'm returning these."
5,OEM quality on the cheap,This battery fits perfectly in the camera and holds a charge very well. For the price it's a no brainer if you need a replacement battery or just want to have an extra to take with you in case you find yourself with a dead battery in the middle of an outing.
4,"Works Great, Slow in Shipping","The shipment arrived almost a week late, but the batteries work as well if not better than the OEM. Note: they ship uncharged."
5,Cheap and powerful,What can I say? It fits in place of the overpriced Canon NB3L battery for my SD500 and lasts longer than the OEM battery. The quality of the battery on the external is very good. No sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts. The battery works very well in the camera and lasts longer by one hundred or so shots. I use a gig card so I tend to shot alot at once. Even with the flash the battery life is comparable to the Canon or even longer. I bought two instead of a single Canon battery and I have not been dissappointed.
4,Does the job.,"Yep, this is the replacement for the Canon's original battery. It is NOT a Canon battery.It works great."
2,Not good,I would better purchase an original Canon battery. Battery life is low and it gets warm very easily affecting my Canon SD500 camera. I will never recommend this product.
1,Defective Product,"I got it, Charge It and tried it.At the time I set it in the camera, it just didn't work, completely dead!I guess that is the reason the manufacturers emphasize in using only canon brand products, it's a shame!"
5,No problem,"Got this as replacement of the OEM battery, which after 3 years was fast fading away. This Lenmar brand battery fits right in and I can't tell the difference from the Cannon one (when it was brand new). Had it for 2 months now and I don't even think about it."
5,Does What You Would Expect,"I needed a new battery for my camera, and this was an absolutely great buy. The battery never dies after using it for a good three hours. Of course I have it off when I'm not using it... but I have not seen it go dead since I've had it... and it's been over a year."
1,3 months,"I lost my original Cannon Battery and charger in the classroom, so I bought two DLC3L and one charger. I thought I could save myself some money, but it turned out that both of them last no more than 3 months.I finally decided to buy an original Cannon battery because when I was going to film my child's graduation, it turned out both fully charged batteries could not do the job within the two-hour ceremony. I had to close to outlet and kept changing the battery in my camera.Anyway, I lost the precious moment of my child.The charger was a pain too. I have to use a small piece of paper to fill in the gap to make battery to closely attach to the electric contact."
3,Works a little,"Having PND for years, along with allergies, I have always been searching for the perfect Lozenge for my throat. My voice keeps faltering and I keep coughing. Makes my throat so raw sometimes, I just do not talk-I whisper. I do not remember how I came across ""Slippery Elm"", but it was touted as being used by SIngers who want to maintain a good clear voice. I tried these, and it worked somewhat. I realize there is no cure-all, but hoped that these tablets would do better for me. The directions are one tablet slowly dissolved every 2 hours. I could use one every 20 minutes, the way my throat/voice is. Hope it works better for others."
2,Helps Sinus Throat Drainage but Only Marginally for Me,While this product is better than nothing I won't be buying any more. It does very little for me .... and a small stick of ginger root in a microwaved cup of boiling water seems much more effective.
4,For hubby's guts,The lozenges are very strong tasting and remind me too much of when I drank the slippery elm tea. Nasty stuff. Hubby has no problem with them. I use another brand which is more pleasant tasting.They do serve the purpose of coating his esophagus and guts and he has had less problems with gerd.
4,"Singer's good friend, but not outstanding","Thayers is interesting tasting and does a good job of keeping your throat moist, but it doesn't seem strikingly better with them than without. What the heck, anything that protects your throat is a good thing, and it sure doesn't hurt my singing."
3,OK,They seem to work but do not taste that good. I suppose because of the zinc in them. I would recommend them to friends.
3,Nothing new here.,"The title ""The 60 Second Organizer"" has no relationship to the contents of the book which is a collection of 60 warmed-over and worn-out tips on organizing and scheduling. Unlike David Allen in his ""Getting Things Done"" and similar books, the author is not offering a system here - just a collection of suggestions, nearly all of which are commonsensical and have been published repeatedly elsewhere.Do you really need Jeff Davidson or anyone else to tell you to ""pack the night before and pack as light as you can""? Or to use rolling luggage? (Tip # 49.) How about this advice on meetings: ""Meet in a room where participants won't be disturbed by ringing phones, people knocking on the door, and other intrusions""? (Tip # 45.) How about this one: ""It'd also a good idea to keep a blanket in your car in case you are stranded someplace where it is cold""? (Tip # 47.)You can safely take a pass on reading this one.Jerry"
2,Bobby Comstock Best of Vol. 1,The selection of songs on this CD is excellent. The problem I have with this product is the sound quality which is unbelievably bad. It sounds as though someone was taping old 45's in their basement. It would be great if a quality CD of Bobby Comstock's music were available.
2,Would be fun...in one piece.,First the thumb on the sword hand broke off. Then one of the other fingers broke off.This was right after taking the toy out of the packaging. It's not a very good likeness of Kain and not the sturdiest of figures. Do yourself a favor and hunt down one of the figures that was released along with the first Soul Reaver game.
4,Kain,"A mostly good figure, though it should have had some articulation in the legs. But besides that it makes a really good statue piece."
4,"A great DVD, great sound.","This DVD is well worth the money. I've seen them live and actually walked out because the performance was very dismal and the sound was terrrible. Florida 1985, what was I expecting?This DVD has great sound and shows the band as best as can be expected. The layering of images does get annoying but does stays true to the their psychadelic style. They really manged to get a great recording from a live performance. As for the Tom Petty comment, you really should get your hearing checked, LOL."
4,A must for all Echo fans,"I have to agree with some previous reviews. The last thing the music of the Bunnymen needs is 'atmosphere'. I didn't like all the fancy visuals and editing at all. The overlapping images were completely unecessary. And at other times there were rapid fire cuts so fast it made my head spin. Still, a worthwhile concert document. The sound is INCREDIBLE. I viewed this without an elaborate 5 speaker system so I envy those that do. Great song selection as well - highlights ""Killing Moon"", ""Rescue"", ""Back of Love"" and ""Nothing Lasts Forever"". However, it would have been cool to have ""Show of Strength"" included."
1,A great band. Too bad this DVD is garbage.,"If you're an Echo and the Bunnymen fan, you no doubt are very interested in this DVD. Well, I love the band, and they sound as good as ever here. And I love concert DVDs (many good ones out there), but trust me, this one is absolutely awful. The rapid-fire editing that others here have complained about is the problem, not to mention the ridiculous overlays that supposedly add ""atmosphere."" The people who made this DVD should be taken out and shot. And the band should have the privilege of pulling the trigger."
4,"Love it but then again I love Echo, Ian & Will","I rented it on Netflix and am watching right now. I have seen them in concert 9 times and have been a fan since 1985. I am enjoying the DVD very much and plan to add to my wish list for my upcoming birthday. It's got a good mix of old songs with new. My favorites: Over the Wall, Villiers Terrace and always have to close with Ocean Rain. It's also got some bonus videos and an audio option in case you have surround sound. I just love them and if you're a fan you won't care about the budget quality. I mean come on, it's not like when they were playing huge arenas."
3,Excellent music... terrible editing!,"Its too bad one of the best bands ever to come out of England has had there live performance butchered by truely amateur editing. I have seen Echo & The Bunnymen live, (in person) six times over the years. They put on an amazing show, but this dvd is unbearable to watch. The overly rapid cutting of the camera angles throughout the entire performance never gives you a good look at the images. Where the editing gets an F the music makes up for it with an A. I do wish they would have included ""Do it clean"" on the song selection, because it is one of Echo & The Bunnymen's most energetic live songs. Go Echo!Paul K.KonaSpy@aol"
2,Great Music - Unwatchable DVD,"You would be better off taking a picture of the band, pasting it on the wall and playing the Liverpool CD. The DVD could have been great, but the camera work is annoying. It switches every half second and you never get a good look at Ian, or Will. There are 1980's effects too. It makes no sense to buy the DVD. Just get the CD for the music, which by the way, is 5 stars."
3,"Fantastic sound, unwatchable video","I cannot say enough good things about the sound quality of this recording: it's brilliant. The video looks like it was edited by my four year old (or someone with an even less attention span). I couldn't even finish watching it and skipped right to the bonus material. I really enjoyed seeing old clips of the band throughout, but it was just not pieced together well at all. The video for ""Make Me Shine"" was great; they should have hired THAT guy to edit the concert footage! It does pain me to write such a negative review for the visual aspect since I am a long time fan, but this is a dvd and I have a gripe with with editor, not the band members. The band sounds great, Ian's voice sounds great, and Will's guitar playing was fantastic, but watching it was not a positive experience."
3,Just OK,My son used it in China this past year. Said it wasn't well made and that most other students used REI products. He did not think it was worth the $$ paid.
4,Well made and very light and handy but also very HOT,It's a very nice poncho. Superb quality. Long enough to keep you dry. The only drawback is that it doesn't breathe and gets very hot even in cool to moderate weather.
3,My addition to my former review:,"I really like this poncho. But when I wore it for the third time the zipper broke. I am returning it, and don't know if I will reorder it or get a different one. I am very disappointed so probably will get one by someone else.It is now a few months later: I have ended up buying it again (dumb me) because I can not find a good poncho anywhere! Anywhere at all! So this time it comes and is even worse, they have changed the material into a really cheap material. The zipper came apart right away, so I am really careful when I zip it. I've just given up finding a good rain poncho anywhere on this planet."
2,So So quality charger.,"I started out really liking this product because I could charge my phone quickly while on the go, but soon found that the wiring link separated and it became useless. I wish that the manufacturer could develop good sheathing so that separation of wires does not occur (due to the plastic cover over the wires breaking and coming off). Well, I guess the old adage ""You get what you pay for"" really applies in this case. :("
1,RIP OFF JUNK,This charger does not fit the LG Chocolate as advertised. I gave it 1 star because that's the lowest rating available. It should be zero star. I threw it in the garbage and lost my money.
3,dull,"This was rated by Gramophone as one of the runners up for best contemporary CD of 2006. As is, this music tells me more about Gramophone and their bias towards English composers and deeply staid music that it does about Mr. Turnage. I may try to listen to it a few more times, but right now I am unimpressed."
4,A Pleasant Change...,"This album is worth it just to hear Ellington play in a different environment. The audio clips are a bit much-mainly in the volume of his voice-but they don't hurt the five main compositions at all. This version of Harlem proves that you cannot beat a jazz orchestra full of well-known, established artists. The frantic, explosive versions of the Ellington orchestra give way to a more rigid, classically-framed verison here. Ultimately, Ellington signed off on this, so it is worth it to hear another side of his vast musical scope."
4,Tomb Raider Lara Croft Action Figure from Tomb Raider Legends video game,I prefer my figurines to be higher build quality and larger scale than this but this is the best Lara Croft figurine I could find so I have to settle for it. It looks right and has multiple weapons that you could choose to pose with. It also has limited mobility with the arms.I would really like one that is similar in quality and size/scale to the Ryu Hayabusa (Ninja Gaiden) that is also available. That one is really the high standard for video game figurines or any figurines really.
4,Decent Statue,"The quality and workmanship isn't at the same level as the game art from Kotobukiya, but for $35, it's a good 7 inch statue of Lara. The face and figure are true to the game (Underworld), but the paint in some areas looks messy and some screws show through.All in all, a good buy and she looks awesome next to my phone on the desk."
5,Great Werewolf Book,"I love werewolf stories and this, by far, is THE best. As other reviewers have stated ... the movie of the same name has a substantially different premise than the book. This is a real page turner. This book holds the potential to haunt every future step you make in a city at night.If you like this book, check out Dean Koontz's ""Watchers."" While not a true werewolf book, it does involve terror from a similar, modern day beast."
2,Movie Was Better,"One of those few instances of the movie being an improvement on the book. While I had no problem with Mr. Streiber's writing, and enjoyed his forays into the minds of the Wolfen, I didn't think the story rang true. The police accepted the existence of the Wolfen too readily, and there were certain instances (like the scene in which they attacked after using the wounded policeman in Central Park as a decoy and Wilson and Becky escaped on the motorcycle) that seemed kind of contrived and a little too hard to explain away. How could oversized dogs chase away two detectives on motorbikes without all the patrolmen at the crime scene noticing, or at the least asking more questions? The Medical Examiner's subsequent motivation for staying away from the larger group where he'd be safe and electing to crawl into the detectives' car likewise didn't make much sense.Having seen the movie first, I missed the Native American angle as well. Communion is a better novel."
3,Food for the beast.,"Much better than movie and very thought proviking, why do so many peopld dissappear each year? Where do they go? A good book to sit back and enjoy."
5,Wolfen - a spellbinding read!,"This book in simply incredible. It is a well crafted roller coaster ride that takes you into the world and mind of the Wolfen, a highly intelligent wolf mutation that lives in and around our civilization and feeds on our outacsts. I couldn't put it down.There is a movie based loosly on the book, but the story of the wolfen is totally lost in the movie version. The movie is a horror-thriller on it's own, but it loses the point of the book, the intelligence and cunning of the Wolfen.If you enjoy a good thriller and a fresh idea and view of our civilization, Wolfen would be a top read for you. I know it is for me.In my opinion, this is Strieber's finest work."
3,Slow moving but entertaining.,"I have just finished reading this book...again. I still had the same problems. The story kept loosing the flow because when things would start to happen, it was over and too much emphasis was put on redundant descriptions and slow dialogue between the main characters. There was a problem with redundant conversations and events among the wolfen also. These really slowed the flow of the story.The only thing that really kept me going was the fact that I had seen the movie several times and I knew things would be happening. I kept matching events in the book with parts of the movie.The last two chapters were the best. I could feel the wolfen's presence, feel their hot moist breath, hear the gnashing of teeth and vividly visualize their attack in the room. This is what the rest of the novel lacked...strong steady flow of events.Would I read it again? Yes, I did find it entertaining. I realize this was a first time novel...onward and upward."
5,A Must Read,"If you have ever seen the movie, then you have to read this novel. The movie pales in comparison to the book. The author is able to depict the dynamics and character of the pack of wolves who are fighting for their very survival. It makes it impossible not to sympathize with the monster (antagonist) of the story."
3,Bad Warrantee Service,"For the first couple of hours, the monitor looked good, but then the display started to shake within a day, and finally collapsed. Called Samsung warrantee, and they said they could only replace it with a refurbished one. If I wanted a refurbished one out of the box, I would have paid a refurbished price! To top it off, after the first year the warrantee says I must pay shipping BOTH ways. I guess Samsung gets so many of these returned that they cannot afford the shipping to replace them. If they built a good monitor in the first place, they wouldn't have to worry about shipping."
4,Thank You AMAZON.COM!,"First, I must thank Amazon.com. I couldn't believe I just found it on Amazon. - No joke, I had checked more than 50 sites to look for 900IFT 19"" monitor. Nobody had it. (...)Anyway, 900IFT gives me more clear and balanced ranges of colors than my old GDM F500. On 900IFT, bright and white color balance with flater screen is outstanding. I was used vivid and yellowish tones with F500 for 3 years, so first few hours were uncomfortible with 900IFT. F500 produces sharper text than 900IFT but 900IFT ""ROCKS"" on 3D images in games.I thought AG could only draw quality pictures until I found 900IFT. I was worng.Again, Thanks Amazon."
3,ok monitor,"I've owned this monitor since it first came out. The only problem is the it scratches very easily, just when using the recommended soft cloth and glass cleaner. I don't know if Samsung has corrected this issue or not, but please check and see. You don't want to be stuck with scratches on your monitor like me."
1,Boring book!,"The author goes on and on about his issues, I found this book very boring. I was hoping to be inspired but instead I was only inspired to throw this book in the bin. Very disappointing."
3,Feels cheap-ish,"Not a huge fan -- I'm returning this because it feels cheap. I was spoiled by a good, solid Revere teakettle; my partner and I are chain-drinking teaheads, and this doesn't feel like it'll stand up to the test--feels like I'll be lucky to get two years out of it. It was hard to even get the fill lid off and back on. Pretty color, though (I got the Granny Smith green) and of course the larger capacity is appealing. But I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Cute but flimsy,"This kettle looks lovely, just like you'd expect from the photo, but it works poorly. The collapsible handle is poor -- it doesn't lock in the up position and ends up folded in the down position most of the time. Unfortunately, this means that the handle gets quite hot every time you make tea -- I had to use a potholder to pour every time. It could be, since I drink several cups of tea a day, that I used this kettle more than most people and overworked the handle. Because of the shape of the handle, I found it hard to hold the kettle and open the spout with one hand, which is a small thing but then I'm used to a kettle with a spout that opens when you push on a switch.Perhaps because of this kettle's light construction, it boils very quickly, which is quite convenient. It's also very large, good if you're making tea for guests."
3,nicely researched,this book is excellent to read if you enjoy myths which might have elements of truth. i treasure this book in my library as its good stuff to spook yourself. i think the author may be telling the truth on some ideas. just read it and enjoy... thats all we can do truly! we can't know anything until the serpents come.
3,Not entirely convincing,"The author's premise - that mankind was created by a race of superior reptilian beings from another planet - has lately been adopted by David Icke and others authors who have tweaked and refined this theory somewhat and made it more plausible. But whichever way you choose to look at it, this idea is hard to accept. Yet it cannot be simply dismissed out of hand, as the material amassed and presented in this book testifies. ALL cultures have dragon or serpent legends, and no amount of scholarship has yet been able to account for this. For my part, although I am open to the concept that humankind was genetically tampered with at one point,I am unconvinced by this author's account of our origins."
4,Near Greatness from an Unexpected Source,"Everybody knows Robert Russell Bennett, right? Broadway, movie arrangements, a few original works, a violin concerto, etc. So thought I until I heard Sights and Sounds. It's a work of extraordinarily high quality and inventiveness. I first heard it cold, coming into a radio broadcast just seconds after it began. I had no idea what was being played but it was riveting. My surprise was complete when its composer was announced. I've since heard it again and my initial impressions were confirmed. Sights and Sounds is a fantastic achievement, and based upon that assessment, I'd say it's incumbent upon us to examine in detail Bennett's large legacy of original compositions. He was no journeyman, but a true creator, a real composer.I have not heard the Lincoln symphony yet."
2,How did they get here?,"I bought this when it first came out and couldn't get through one listening. I couldn't believe that the band that recorded such classics as ""Handsworth revolution"" and ""Tribute to the martyrs"" somehow progressed to this.I recently tried to listen to this again and I have not changed my mind. None of these songs captivate me like thier other recordings. The songs themselves are not really bad, they are just plain uninteresting to me. My main issue with this recording is that the instrumentation is so late '80s and sounds like a lame attempt to jump on a disco bandwagon that had long since past by."
3,Words cut deeper then a knife,"With These Hands is a murder,mystery, suspense that starts off slow but will keep you turning the pages. Derek Vitatoe will capture his reading audience attention as he narrates' what would push the average college student over the edge. You will find out just how deep words can cut a person. Black Dawn Publishing is on the come up don't blink cause you will miss a good book. www.coast2coastreaders.com"
3,"A sideways review of ""A Sideways Look at Time""","Jay Griffiths is a great writer, but is so detailed in her every word that, for me, she takes extreme concertration to totally understand each and every sentence. Not an easy book to read fast, but full of facts and laughts. I read this after reading her book ""Wild"". Both are written in the same intense way. Both are books that you could read a second or third time and discover things you missed before. Read her if you love interesting facts and details. Do not read her if you like page turners, as a few pages a day are all I could degest."
1,Wasting Time ... Reading about TIME!,"This book represents the WORST kind of ""mental masturbation""!The author forces readers to endure ENDLESS, unbroken, unnavigable prose, which is occasionally interspersed with some (obviously) well researched factoids about how different cultures and different historical periods view the measurement of time and their relationship to it. Unfortunately, there is NOTHING to break up this relentless diatribe, save for an occasional quote: No subheads, no photos, no imagery at all -- just 360 pages of regurgitated research into time, separated only by 13 chapter titles!Reading this book is worse than slogging through a text book. I suppose that readers should be grateful that the author saw fit to use appropriate paragraph breaks and a few quotes, or this book would be one LLLOOONNNNGGGG paragraph -- which is how it reads!!"
5,Great Country Singer,"I remember Lionel Cartwright from the late 80s. I recently came across this CD on the secondary market and I am so glad I got it. It brought back fond memories. Lionel Cartwright is one of those great singer/songwriters who got lost in the rise of the careers of George Straight, Alan Jackson, Clint Black, etc. It's too bad he did not get as much air play on the radio as the others because he really is a terrific singer and songwriter. Some of the gems on this CD are Like Father Like Son, Give Me His Last Chance (my personal favorite), and Blue Fiddle Waltz. If you like Good country music, you will love Lionel Cartwright!"
1,completely disappointed,I ordered the cd and I was very disappointed when my father opened his gift Christmas morning and the case was right and the cd was wrong. If I could I would give no stars...just completely disappointed.
2,Returned this item,I bought this item because of its size--I needed a really huge pillow to use as a barricade for my toddler to stay away from certain objects. But I returned it because I was disappointed with it. The colors aren't as bright as pictured and the surface fabric is of a sort of suede-like quality (though the item is supposedly 100% cotton) which I didn't like.
5,My Favorite Bollywood Movie,"This movie is beautiful. It is a long movie, but you will never know it because you become so engrossed in the story. The actress is beautiful and you really feel for her character. The gentleman who plays her father is great! The singing, dancing, and clothing are wonderful. I watch this one as often as I can.The only thing I did not like - the special features did not have English captions, so you really couldn't enjoy them.I also purchased the soundtrack to this movie. It is excellent and has more songs that were used in the movies."
1,Cleopatra myth,"I wonder why the author is so keen to claim Cleopatra as one of her own people.She was certainly not black, she wasn't even Egyptian except by birth, she was Greek, her father was Ptolemy XII Auletes and her mother,as was customary for Egyptian pharoahs, would have been a close relative, probably a sister.Cleopatra would have owned black slaves like any other ruler of ancient Egypt which makes her an odd choice for this list.I'm afraid such lack of regard for accuracy discredits both the author and her, no doubt, well intentioned book."
1,Not good,I bought this mop because I liked that it had the brush to scrub up gunk stuck on the floor. I like that. But the mop head isn't at all absorbent.The proper way to mop is to put the wash water on the floor with the mop. Scrub up the gunk. Then dry the mop and soak up the dirty water.This mop does the first two parts well. But it doesn't soak up the dirty water. So after scrubbing I have to use a towel to soak up the dirty water.And the mop head has some kind of scrubby surface on it. With the brush it doesn't really need it.I wrote to O'cedar about my comments. I was told I could send the whole mop back for a refund. Mail a mop??? I just wish it would have sounded like they listened to my comments.I wish I could get a different mop head.
2,Poor replacement design,"I just finished changing the head on this mop. Prior to that, I would have given it 4 stars. The mop works very well, and is the best I've used, outside of a commercial-style mop and bucket. But, dear lord, the way the heads attach is horribly thought out. The heads attach via a small metal hook, not a bad idea. However, out of necessity, the end of the hook curves back into the mop. This means that the new mophead needs to be forced inside the rollers to get it attached. The mechanism that moves the hook already has a position for changing the mophead that moves the hook farther forward than normal. However, it's not far enough. That's what's so infuriating. Given an extra 1/2 inch of movement, this mop would be great, and changing the heads would be a breeze. As it stands, it's a good mop with a terrible system for holding the head in place. Look elsewhere."
1,Proprietary Mop Head,"I wish I had noticed that this mop uses its own style of mop head when I bought it. Now I can't find any replacements. Oh, and you'll need a replacement very shortly since the mop heads are low quality. I wish I hadn't bought this piece of junk!"
4,Nice set,"I think this is a nice set of songs. I think Ed Motta is talented- genius I'm not sure. But this disc is good for popping in the car for a drive. Its a 70's sounding kinda record.I have also Dwitza which is really good, but a little more experimental. This CD is smoother and more straight ahead.People get too hung up on labels and comparisons. Maybe they should try making their own music, and they'll see. I do, its hard to create something good much less great. And as so much has been done before us its hard to create something completely new. My 2 cents."
1,Have you heard Banda Black Rio?,"Brazilian funk? No, just a copy (a bad copy, by the way) of American funk bands from the 70s. And sung (badly) in Portuguese...Looking for original and creative Brazilian instrumental funk music? Banda Black Rio, a legendary group, is the real thing.Ed is only a trickster..."
1,DO NOT MAKE A MISTAKE,"Forget the hype on this guy. He tells himself he is a genius. But he is just a musician with no originality, that takes elements from 200 artists and presents nothing new. He probably would like to be a Steely Dan member. However the truth is very different. Avoid to spend your money."
2,Pro-Privatization,"I will begin by stating that I have a major problem with the book. Savas skews his own statistics in order to push readers into supporting the privatization of our nation's public sector. His book focuses entirely on the private sector's greater efficiency over the public sector without addressing many other important issues. If you want a very one sided book that is pro-privatization, then buy this one. If, however, you would like a book that seeks to enlighten readers with facts and allows them to make their own decision on the matter, then find another book."
4,Privatization and Public-Private Partnerships,"I'm interested in knowing more about the PPPs. Even though this book defends a view contrary to mine, it's very interesting to understand what are the grounds which the author uses to defend the PPPs."
3,Nice Beats,"Good beats, sort of a funk/dance version of RJD2 or Blockhead. Real upbeat, with some nice use of guitar and latin beats. However, every track sounds like some other artist, so it lacks a little in the creativity department. Great for mixtaping, though."
5,So yummy!!!,"Oh wow, when you eat this hot, soon after it's done...it's really good. Even my husband really loved it:)"
1,Man does this album suck.,"This is the definiton of generic, there is nothing unique here just more formulaic crap, this is a bad album, i hope these guys have gotten other jobs by now. Even the Amazon description of this album says it sucks, and their goal is to hype stuff up so it sells, what does that tell you?"
1,REGGEATON IS WHACK,just another album full of recycled beats and played out hooks appealing to idiot middle school kids. i strongly recommend no one buy ANYTHING reggeaton.
4,"Not what I expected, but still good","I thought this CD would have more upbeat songs, but most of them are medium ""speed"" I guess. Otherwise, for what the music actually is, I was very impressed."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,I purchased the Mollard E69-CVR Mollard Univ Baton Case Cover based on the discription and the photo. This item is to be made of a a type of wood NOT the vinyl piece of junk this company sent. Never again will I purchase anything from this company.
3,1950's Soul Stirrers,Old time gospel songs. Songs are good although they are a little slower then what I had been looking for.
5,Worth Reading,"This is a great book. In my opinion, it gives you good reasons to look at your own beliefs and question them.It inspired me and helped to answer some nagging questions.I recommend this book to all those people out there who ask ""Why?"" and sincerely want an answer."
5,All Time Statesmen Hits Without the Scratches....,"This is the first time I have heard many of these songs on CD. Prior to this all I had were 78s and albums from the 40s, 50s, and 60s. They were scratched up from years of use and some even traveled with my Daddy to Korea and Alaska.All I can say is kudos to Hovie Lister for keeping the masters to these recordings and re-releasing them in a clear CD form.The only reservation I had to this release was the fact that some of these songs were recorded after Jake Hess left to form the Imperials, so Jack Toney is featured on some songs without getting even a picture credit on the cover.Other than that-- this CD has yet to be removed from my CD carousel."
2,"Nice Device, but Fatally Flawed Security","I was pretty happy with this device overall, until I accidentally discovered that it is trivial to bypass the device's password protection.The drive allows you to set a device password -- when you insert the drive, you must enter the password to access the programs or data. A minor annoyance is that the password prompt doesn't appear on my systems, forcing me to manually run the launcher. (In fairness, this might well be a Windows problem.) It performs well when plugged into a USB 2.0 port; tolerably well when plugged into a USB 1.0 port.The fatal flaw, however, is that if I insert the drive *before* powering on my laptop, the drive is completely accessible without having to enter the password. It's still a handy device for enabling trackless computing on a strange computer, but if you're counting on the security to be, well, secure, this is not the device for you.If the security weren't flawed, I would have given this four stars."
1,Died after 2 days.,Died after a couple of days of use. Seller offered 7 day garuntee but has not respond to email for replacement or refund. I thought only SanDisk thumb drive died like this.
2,misleading advertising,"I was not aware until purchasing, that the U3 Smart Drive by Kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me. However I will use it as a general back up thumb drive."
1,U3 Stinks,"There is very, very little you can do on the U3 platform that can't be accomplished on an ordinary USB drive platform. Even if you are in the very small minority that needs to boot from a portable device, it's important to keep in mind that a) U3 applications are highly overpriced, b) extremely limited in number and c) limited to cheesy programs of dubious value such as password databases, form fillers, ad nauseum. I mean, what idiot would buy a $100 U3 device plus a $25 application all in the hopes of managing passwords?"
3,u3 apps overpriced,"I'd like to see an auto timed 'backup to disk' option with 'delete files from pc' exit option for all the files on the u3 because I don't trust flash drive reliability.If I'm to run apps off this drive, I'd like to know it will stand up to continual usage.I don't have this model, I have memorex u3 but I assume performance is similar. Memorex makes annoying high pitched whine when accessed. Am running firefox off it with some lag time. Have to keep my tabs to minimum."
3,Shirley Temple Story Book Collection,"I love Shirley Temple and loved the idea of seeing her early work. This collection is very cute, but I couldn't help thinking that what was sweet and innocent back when these movies were made is maybe questionable today. The shorts were very cute, but I just kept imagining the sick world we live in today and the fact that some perverts might get off on the idea of puting babies in grown up situations like this. Unfortunately that's just the world we live in today. That said, these movies were cute and funny and I would imagine back when they were played in theaters they did help bring laughter and fun into peoples lives when things were so tough. The very young children running around in diapers with over sized safty pins in a boxing ring was fun and had us laughing most of the time."
5,FROM THE PUBLISHER:,"The only complete reference source on CB PLL synthesizer circuits ever published! Detailed PLL theory explained in layman's terms. How they work, and how to modify them for many more channels. Includes specific PLL block mixing diagrams, truth charts, & ICpin function diagrams for nearly every PLL chip ever used. Covers all the most popular U.S. & export chassis, with specific listings of all models using the chip."
3,Looking for Thai Holy Basil? This is Not It.,"I was hoping to recreate authentic Ga Pow Gai in America, but this isn't Thai holy basil. The seeds however were of good quality and I easily grew a large crop. The flavor and aroma is reminiscent of apple and cinnamon. It's not at all like Thai Holy Basil which is peppery and maybe even a little like licorice. Anyway, maybe this is more like an Indian version?"
3,Good Find,"I ordered this product and was happy to receive it earlier than expected. It was easy to plant and I now have quite a few little plants growing. It takes time and some effort to make sure they grow up properly, but if you're into growing ...these are worth it!"
1,Came quickly,Came quickly but seeds did not produce a holy basil plant looks like a bunch of weeds. They were watered regularly and were not exposed to extreme temperature
3,slow motion,"this game is fun and cool, but i had to give it 3 stars because of the time it takes to load. i can play 2 or 3 rounds of golf before the game loads up. the controls aren't that great also. the game could use a lot of improvement. the 'create a character' mode was horrible. you can't create a character, you have to pick one. overall, i found it fun to play, but considered suicide while waiting for the game to load."
4,Rent Borrow but Don't Buy,"I was proud of myself with my restraint. I wanted to buy this game the day it came out, but having been burned on many wrestling titles I decided to rent the game from the local video store. Good thing I did because I'm sure I'll be tired of it before my 5 days is up.The controls feel slopy. The computer cheeses like crazy (mostly by repeatedly throwing things that you can't dodge). And there isn't much selection in the way of characters.On the up side, this game is a very origional twist on wrestling. I can't say I agree with the real BYW, but in video game form, I can't really see the harm in it. The enviroments are very interactive. I was surprised when I was able to set a matress on fire and burn my oponnent.Though this is not a great game there is promise. The Smackdown series started off rather weak, but now it is the best of the wrestling titles."
3,Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This At Home,"this game getz boring after playing fo a while, but the only good thing about this game is the movie. the game was funny at first than i got tire of it. games is kind of easy, but coolest is the special i have ever seem, and why does a wrestling have a life meter,m it was gay once your life meter is out you lose . i think you should just rent it you probobly can beat it one day. i done it."
1,backyard boring fun,"In one word i will say what this game is all about ""stupid"", the charactors act stupid the girls are stupid the video clips are stupid this game reeks of stupid! Its ultra hard and no wrestling is ever involved its just fight club with macho teenagers. The reason people buy WWE is we get what we want mostly which is wrestling, not some dope saying he is a viagara expirement gone wrong.puching and throwing bricks is not wrestling its boring hardcore baby stuff, sissies fight hardcore because they cant wrestle!"
3,Just not enough,"I was realy looking forward to this game after reading all of the reviews. Then the truth set in when I recieved the game. The game simplely put leaves you wanting more. More boards that is. there are only 7 boards that get mighty boring after playing them 4 or 5 times each. I also had several problems with glitches in the program. Lock up, charicters geting stuck behind things on the boards that seem as though they where maybe supossed to go erlier in the game development and some how was not totaly written out. It does have some realy cool moves and and all kinds of stuff to use as weapons. (i.e. bottles,chains,barbwire wraped clubs ext.) On a scale of 1-10 I would have to give it a 5"
1,if i could give it a 0 i would,"i hate this game... i know physics isnt a big basis in most games, but when the comp throws something at you it turns in mid-air to hit you... wtf??? when you fall down you squirm... who squirms?!?!! and best of all: there is no tutorial youre thrown into the game not even knowing the buttons, i didnt have a booklet with it when i rented it and i had to have my ass kicked about 400 times before i realized what the buttons did i would not order this game aven if it were free... well ok i would, then i would snap the cd in two"
5,Great item!,"Very cute, great detail, and very good, solid quality silver. Very happy with the purchase!"
4,"Fast Delivery, New Condition, Consistently Satisfied","This is exactly the text I needed (because of course, no one's going to order Fundamentals of Fluid Mech. by accident). I ordered directly from Amazon with this one, as opposed to one of Amazon's associated vendors. Because I ordered from Amazon, I received the book a day or two ahead of their projection (which is typical), and the book was packaged with care to preserve its new condition (which is also typical). I plan to order some other texts from Amazon very soon, and do not mind paying the extra $4 or $5 to order DIRECTLY from Amazon, because of their reliability and quality of goods. I was also very pleased with the Free Shipping option which only adds 1 or 2 days to the delivery time at most."
2,The most incomplete engineering book ever.,It's a good book it just askes me as a student to assume too much. Some of the problems at the end of the chapters are incomplete.If i was to go about my life as a ME assuming random stuff i would get sued to a point of non-existance. This book does not teach good engineering practices.
5,Great Service,"The seller was great, very involved in the whole process, when the book did not show up on time, they tracked the package to find the problem and made sure it got to me."
4,Read it and learn many lessons of life.,"This was a great book. I think it's very impportant for many to read this book at come time. Milkman learned many important life lessons that we all need to learn. I enjoyed her style of writing, she is a great author. She used many excellent writing techniques, such as, the motif of ""flying"" to create symbolism and imagery."
3,A Nice Collection,"A nice collection of original artists, only a few really relate to the Hawaiian theme, but a good CD as long as you're not looking for real Hawaiian music. All songs can be found individually, there are no rare songs here."
3,There are better Munequitos de Matanzas CD's out there,"I love Munequitos de Matanzas but I don't think this CD is a very good representation of how good they are and what they can do. If you are interested in them I would check out one of their other CD's and skip this one. Love the group, just not this disc."
4,Nostalgia Unchained!,"This was one of the sweetest movies I remember from my childhood. I could totally relate to the characters and their situation. I had some crazy air-headed friends and some uptight serious friends (still do). The politics of the '80's may have sucked but the ""teen"" movies were golden!I am purchasing this movie, primarily, for the song ""Dear You"" by Josie Aiello. I haven't been able to find that song or this movie soundtrack anywhere. When I heard it, I remembered thinking, ""I've felt that way!"" (*_*)"
5,Mainly intended for collectors and fans,"Do not expect much from the story, it did not even stand out much as far as early 80's teen film genre. I purchased this solely because I enjoy collecting the works of Jennifer Connely. I cannot comment directly on the quality of the VHS version, since I managed to find it finally released on DVD, which I use for actual viewing.If you consider yourself a Connely fan, then this title is well worth getting for it's rarity. As far as the acting goes, as with many of her similar roles, Jennifer convincingly comes across as a strong willed and highly independent individual. Her superior acting stands out, far exceeding some of the other actors in this film, but you may have to ignore shortfalls in the story plot in order to really pay full attention to acting value."
4,Excellant as always.,"What can I say about one of Richard Bach's book? This one is, like all the rest, entertaining and thought provoking."
4,A Charmer,"Bach is a lyricist. He tells the most simple of stories with grace and deep meaning. Beyond that, however, and purely from a plot perspective, this memoir is a charmer. Bach and two friends spend a summer flying around the country, trying to recreate the 1920s barnstorming days. The very fact that their adventure is a recreation and not the real thing brings extra value to me, as I research the era for my next novel, since it offers much insight into the changes that have come about since the 1920s. The book is enjoyable and worthwhile from an informational standpoint, but it also offers worthwhile themes and plenty of fun."
5,A Blast From the Past,"I have been raised on rock. When Starz came out in the mid 70's, it was a breath of fresh air. These boys rock. For anybody who doesn't really knows this band, the have the ... to roll a 4 track recorder with them and record their live show, then put it out as an album. That takes guts. This album represents some of their finer songs. Although there really isn't any song they have done I have disliked... Get the CD and see for yourself. ""GOTTA ROCK 6 TIMES ALRIGHT!"
5,Starz Rocks Live..The Old Fashioned Way...,"This CD is a great compilation of Starz early rock tunes...Pull The Plug is a mesmorizing live tune, much like Cheap Trick's ""Need Your Love"". Boys In Action, Subway Terror, Live Wire, Cherry Baby and the rest are solid amped rockers that make this one terrific purchase! For even more, the ""Brightest Starz Anthology"" has all the great material from the studio, that rocks every bit as much as the live CD (Amazon just delivered mine today...It's now available) If you're a fan, buy these CDs. If you like to rock... these deliver! SJ from So. Cal."
4,Great gadget/fastener container,"This is a great organizer for screws, nails, hooks, as well as larger items like tape, a box cutter, or a small level. It's easily customizable, with plastic pieces to make sections to fit the contents. If those partitions fit better, I would give this organizer 5 stars, but they curve a bit when inserted, which sometimes allows for smaller nails to slide into other compartments."
5,Great organizer!,"I use this for all of my vape supplies (e-cigs, tanks, batteries, atomizers, etc.). Just super! Sturdy, easy to carry and has a huge capacity. If you have a need for deeper compartments, get the Stanley 04026R SortMaster Organizer but for my vaping products this is terrific. The dividers are well designed and fit tightly so if you are a beader or jewelry designer I suspect even the smallest beads will not slide through the slots. Very nice product. Love it."
4,You will find a use for this.,"I purchased this organizer for miniatures gaming storage and transport.Alot of people I talked to bought this organizer for the same reason. I will be looking to get another one in the future.As I said in the title, if miniatures gaming isn't your thing, you will find a use for this organizer/tote."
4,Works great for my miniatures game,"Bought this for use with my recently purchased xwing miniatures. I use the top section for all the dice, markers and tokens. While the bottom section holds all the miniatures. It works perfectly, although a sharp knife is needed to separate the dividers, and the handle could be a bit more comfortable to grasp. Will most likely get more of these as I expand my collection. It would work well for other hobbies that use lighter parts as well. I wouldn't use it with tools and hardware as the weight would pop the dividers out or the case open unless you stick to small amounts of the lighter variety."
4,Good Purchase,I liked this organizer. Comes in really handy. The lid was not as sturdy as I thought it would be but it is still a great product for the price!
5,Good storage box for NXT 2.0,Needed a box that could hold all the parts for a Lego Mindstorms NXT 2.0 Robot kit. This works very well. Enough compartments to hold all major parts types (not a sperate compartment for each part). Just be careful not to open the bottom compartment without closing the top first! I haven't done it yet but would be easy to do. Well made box for the cost. Made in USA.
2,overrated,"got one to store electronics.the locks are inconvenient to say the least.It came with strips of plastic for internal walls that you have to break AND refinish with a knife all the edges because they use the cheapest molds. most of the separators wouldn't fit because of untrimmed edges. just awful manufacturing.even after the inner wall fits, small items like resistors keep moving from one to another because it does not seal correctly at the bottom/top of the separator. This was the deal killer for me. SMD parts (Edit: after treating it with static dissipative spray) would be a huge NO NO for this.it's way heavier than it should. and the handle is not open, making carrying it more than a few steps unpractical and It's impossible to do simple things like holding two of those with the same hand."
5,Just what I need,"I use this container for jewelry supplies such as beads and small tools. The top I use for the smaller beads and pieces and the bottom I use for tools, wire, glue, etc. The size is pretty perfect for this use. It is a sturdy container, and I love the fact that it is customizable with the little tabs you can choose where you put them and where you don't. If I find myself needing more space, I'll buy another one of these!"
5,Works Great,"I bought this to use eor sorting all the computer screws I have accumulated over the years so it easier to find the one I'm looking for. It has enough compartments that you can sort by diameter, thread pitch, length and head type. I am not done sorting yet, but I certain the effort will prove worthwhile."
1,never buy here,"I still have not received these , been over 3 months ,submitted a claim and never got an answer or nothing ,, all thou i have gotten from them in the past ,i will shop elsewhere now"
4,"Lippincott's Review Series, Medical-Surgical Nursing (Book with CD-ROM","Book is good great for NCLEX style Q&A with rationals, a must have for MED-SURG Nursing Library, but was missing the CD rom"
4,A Good Read!,"Hendrie Davis Weisinger is simple, clear and very focused as he applies recent ""emotional intelligence"" techniques to the specific area of criticism, and helps the reader think of criticism as a valuable, vital tool, and not just a necessary evil. The tips in this self-improvement book push the reader toward greater self-awareness, a major element of emotional intelligence. The suggestions are elemental, most of them are easy to implement and even the hardest ones to enact require only a modest time commitment. The book's message is consistent to the point of repetition, though its simple language gives it real power. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who gives or receives criticism, which is to say, everyone. In particular, if you are a manager, an executive and or supervisor who deals with difficult personalities, here's how to tell them what you need them to know."
1,Body Sculpting book,"Received book promptly. Appeared in good condition but upon opening book several times, the binding came unglued. Was giving to another individual for reference and binding didn't separate until presented to them. Ugh!! Embarrassing!!!"
4,Great beginner workout book,Personal trainers are expensive. This is a great alternative for a beginner. Make sure you stick to the 14 days or you might not see the results your hoping for.
5,Great Book,"This book is easy to use. Not only is the book great, but he authors are too. They offer their web site address in the back of the book . There you can find their email addresses, and ask them questions, if you need clarifications about the workouts.The book explains basic biology, breaks down the correct way to lift for each excersise, and nutrition. This is a great book for all women at any stage of fitness. I'm seeing great results!"
1,I hated it!,"This book is terrible. First of all, the workout is six days a week. I don't want to spend my life in the gym! There is no reason you have to work out that much! Second of all, there is nothing unique to women in the book. The authors even talk about raising testosterone levels. As a woman, I am definitely not wanting to increase testosterone! I showed this to a trainer and he told me it was the type of workout that men did when they are on steroids. And finally, the workouts have to be done in a gym. If you don't have access to a whole bunch of expensive equipment, forget it. You can't even do the workout (which isn't realistic anyway)."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"I bought this book based on the customer reveiws, and now I feel like a fool because they were obviously written by the authors themselves! They all read like an infomercial! I am working on my Masters Degree in Exersise Phisiology and I am always looking for books on the subject to add to my library. This book went in the trash. Athletes or people who train more than 3 times per week should NEVER be on a high protien, low carb diet. And for heavens sake we need more than 1200 calories! I believe this book will lead people to be misinformed. There are some good tips on weight training, but you can get the same information from many other books (I would recommend those that are written for women, by women) and magazines that don't need the authors to write 5-star reveiws for themselves. How pitiful."
5,The best training without a trainer,"I have in the past worked out with a professional trainer who worked me until I cried. Due to the amount of money it was costing me, I had to stop... which also made me cry. But this book is about the best workout I could have without a trainer. After only 2 days, I feel pleasantly sore. This guide provides varied workouts which I like too. It's not the same boring routine every day. Buy this one with the Ab-Sculpting book for the total body workout. I'm going to buy the Men's book for my boyfriend."
2,No Benefit for Intermediate/Advanced workout crowd.,"The first two reviews mislead me into buying this book. I was under the impression that it would be a valuable resource to add to my workout library. Unfortunately, it did not provide any indepth information that I didn't alreay have from reading other fitness magazines. This book is only valuable if you're just starting out and need to understand how to work out from A to Z."
1,A Rip Off,"This book has nothing new in it. It rehashes what is found in other books. Worse, it really doesn't distinguish how training should be altered for women. It is basically a guy's bodybuilding routine packaged as a woman's fitness book. There are many other, better books on bodysculpting for women. This is a rip off."
2,Not what I was expecting,"With a title like the ""Body Sculpting Bible,"" I was expecting a comprehensive guide to exercise for women. I was greatly disappointed. The book is long on exercises and short on information. It breezes through most of the meat and potatoes of training without going indepth. There really was nothing presented that anyone who reads a few fitness magazines wouldn't know. It did have a lot exercise descriptions that were okay, hence the rating of 2 stars instead of 1. Still, this isn't enough to make a good book so I returned it."
1,buy anything from joyce vedral for awesome home workout,i want to work out at home with weights and was using a book by joyce vedral. i wanted to check out something else to see if what i had was good. joyce vedral rocks...this book garbage. joyce gives pullouts you can use while doing your workout. this book doesn't have an easy way to follow their workout. these men also have a diet consisting of living on protein shakes and protein bars. i am a 36 year old mother of two with a full time job. with joyce vedrals books i've lost inches in two months time and feel great. its easy to follow i've just ordered 3 more so i can modify my workout. for the average woman looking to work out with hand weights and a bench with joyce you are set.
1,Doesn't Deliver What's Promised,"I used the programs for three months and I actually GAINED four pounds and got bulky arms when my goal was to lose weight and tone up. Also, the two week program is very deceiving. When you read it, it doesn't mean that you get in shape in two weeks, it's just two weeks of workouts which get very boring after a while. I'm very upset at the marketing of this book and caution others to be careful when reading the ads."
2,complicated,"This is an ok book, but if you are looking for a simple routine and easy answers you won't find it here. This book is very indepth and detailed. I would recommend this book to someone who wants to know all the details and really get into exercise."
1,You've got to be kidding me...,"Come on, this is NOT good!!! A bunch of rehashed programs from the 70s. It reads like an overly long magazine article. If you follow the book you're working out 12 hours a week! I have a life! Much better is ""Body for Life"" by Bill Phillips. It has a realistic program that you can do in a reasonable time and still have time for your life.I also will say that I checked this out based on the reviews and I now think that most of them aren't for real. Looking back at the comments, they are all very similar, thanking the authors and using their names. Sounds to me like the author's themselves wrote them. Shame on them."
4,easy to follow book...,this book is great for people that are just starting to working out. It shows you the right way to use weights/equipments.
2,Save your money,"This book is a total waste of money.After using it solidly for more than 2 months now, I haven't lost any inches or anything. (Not to mention, I've been dieting).I was on the Advanced Plan doing 6 cardio and 6 weight training sessions per week. I practically lived at the gym.This plan takes WAY too long per day, and it doesn't work.I'm off to try something different."
3,Received Wrong Item. **UPDATE**,"I received the wrong item. I received ""World War II U.S. Navy Air Combat"" by Robert Lawson and Barrett Tillman instead of ""U.S. Navy Fighters of WWII (Enthusiast Color Series)"". The ""Used Good"" bar-code label was for the ordered item, but was on the wrong book. Despite the error, I will keep the item.**UPDATE** 12/6/2011Seller Response: ""Hello, I am so sorry to hear that your order was not as described. I have contacted Amazon on your behalf and requested a full refund, as this was an FBA order. We hope you will give us another opportunity to earn your business.""Date: December 6, 2011Because of seller's quick response and their offer of a refund, I am happy with their effort to correct the `Fulfillment by Amazon' error. I am pleased with this third-party seller, GreatBuyBooks and am increasing my rating to three stars."
5,Good small book,"For a book of its size, this was very good. The pictures are excellent and the stories of the fighters themselves were just as good. Recommended for anyone interested in U.S. Naval aviation in the Second World War."
5,The best book about goaltending I ever red,"This is the best book of goaltending I had the chance to read. Even if all the techniques are not fully detailed, it gives you all the important rules to remember when you're between the pipes and also lot of useful tricks. I have learned something on each page I red. ""Il est vraiment bien!"""
3,"Good, but lacked goaltending technique substance","I liked the book as it was interesting to read, but the techniques were few and far between. A lot of conditioning was covered, which personally I didn't care for, but may be necessary for those just starting out. Overall, it was worth the money as I am an avid hockey nut, but I was looking for more skill building techniques to be covered."
3,Good book that covers all aspects of the game for BEGINNERS.,"Very easy to read with lots of pics. It has lots of tips for beginners and helpful tricks. Whenever I read this book it refreshes my memory of the basics (what to and not to do). The techniques are not fully detailed but give enough info to help thoes new to the game, but it will only act as a refresher course for those in the higher levels of the game."
4,Comprehensive Goaltending Knowledge for Ice and Inline!,"I purchased this book when I first got into hockey roughly 4 years ago. It's complete with conditioning drills, information on equipment, positioning stances, and what to do in key situations. In fact, the only reason that I've given it 4 stars out of 5 is simply because the information at this point could stand to be revised. Yet it covers both butterfly goaltending (which is the standard across ice hockey today) and stand-up goaltending (less common in ice hockey, but still very necessary for inline play.)If you're starting to play hockey and want to be a goalie, I'll tell you right now that this book is very useful to get yourself going."
1,Good for beginners only,"This book is an excellent starting point for a young goalie. If you know nothing about the position, this will get you going.Unfortunately, all the instruction is terribly superficial, meaning an experienced goalie will find next to nothing in it to elevate his/her game.If you are just starting out, buy it. If you've already been playing for a while, save your money."
3,Wonderful collection of covers,"It is CD's like these that deserve to be sold and purchased as a CD. The collection of songs and artists are superb, and although I am not a fan of all tracks, I am pleased with my first listen. Dido's Fire and Rain, alone is worth the purchase... and I can tell you that if you ever wanted to stump your audiophile friends, play the ""let's dance"" track and see if they can guess the song. Reminds me of the story by Ray Manjarek, listing to ""X's"" version of ""Soul Kitchen"" for the first time, it took him three listens before he realized it was a Doors' Song."
4,The BEST DBZ fighter,this game has awesome graphics and cool characters.it's the fun of both budokais on the go!
2,I'm Back with real info,"I'm back now I have full proof info. The game is not called Revenge of Buu it is called Buu's Fury for game boy advance I have proof go to neoseeker.com scroll down click on dragonball z supersonic Warriors it will lead you to all dragonball z games even some you never even heard of scroll down the the side. Look at GBA games you should see it. It even has images and pics. It' s suppose to come out sepetember, and guess what it's suppose to be the suquel!!!!!!!!!! and the last one of it's kind yes Dragonball z Legacy Of Goku 3 buu saga even the fusion saga you get to use Vegito Gotenks ssj and more i'm not telling you the rest though it's to good to be true check it out. It's suppose to last longer than a week to beat."
4,a dissapointment,"Keep in mind that I am a fan of the show and own 4 sagas, but this game was awful. Combos are unrealisticaly hard hard, like one is down, down, right, right, left, left, down, down, right, right, left, left, punch, punch (something like that anyway). Also, you only power up when do an attack. The game is short and repetitive. The unlocking characters are dull because there all pretty much the same anyway. I would seriosly advise the legacy of goku over this pice of junk."
2,don't buy unless you would die for DBZ,"This game was horrible! There was no story line and the graphics sucked! The unlockables weren't that good and by the time you mash the buttons to do a special attack, the opponent is dead! There wasn't any differences between the characters besides the looks. They all had almost the exact same attacks. There's no storyline at all! Playing this stupid game, made my buttons on my GBA go soft!"
2,WORST DBZ GAME EVER!!!,"This is by far the worst DBZ game I have ever played! I own all the DBZ GBA games including the newer fighting game ""Super Sonic Warriors"". I got Taiketsu without reading any reviews. I cant believe I was soooo naive to buy this game! I was so dissipointed by the small limit of moves to do, the corny looking graphics, and its really hard to do combo moves! I was so upset that I wasted $25 on it that I pretended I liked so I felt like I got my moneys worth. Dont buy this game if you want to play a good DBZ GBA game then get Super Sonic Warriors which is a trillion times better!"
2,Big stinker!!,its a on OK game but controls can me better and gaphics are a little wierd but it is a real bummer....my advice is unless your a really big fan of DBZ don't get it
2,it's not even dragonball z !!!!!!!!!!!!,"It's not good sorry to say people if you see this stores ignore dragonball z taikestu sucks!!!!!!!!!! please warning a waste of money i'ts slow and sucks get dragonball z legacy of goku 1or2I but get 2 more or get dragonball z supresonic it's to good,I know something special since I'm such a good gamer in september there gonna let out revenge of buu now if i'm wrong please forgive, but thats whats been going around and it's real cause saw it.p.s. again i'm not sure with the date or name please forgive if it's not right besides I saw on my computer last month so I forgot a little and sorry if I got the name wrong, but that game should be one of the best yet. If doesn't exist i'm gonna be totally confused"
1,awful,"terrible, terrible, terrible game. the combos are impossible and there isnt even a story/tutorial. i can see why this person sold it."
1,Dragon Bsll Z Taiketsu,When I first saw this game I thought it would be fun. I was wrong. The game has horrible graphics. The game also has no story mode what so ever. when I tried to do asuper attack it was like entering a cheat code. The only easy thing was hand to hand combat It was the worst thing you can possibly spend money on. If you like 2D and 3D graphics that are horrible and for dessert has a crappy way of fighting than go spend 30 dollars on it.
4,Dragon Ball Z Taiketsu,"Well they finally make a real dragon ball z game for the GBA this is what Dragon Ball Z is all about, no more walking around or trading cards just pure fighting like in the series and i'm sure this should be a good game because it will have Gotenks and for the first time ever in a DBZ game, Broly! well except for 1 game Dragon Ball Z super Boutoden 2 so with Broly in this game it should be good! I just hope they make it like Dragon Ball Z Hyper Dimension"
1,This was the crappiest game id ever played,"This game was terrible the worst game i ever played. The graphics was bootleg the storymode was garbage the character design was ugh! this was a bad game, bad meaning it was garbage they did a number on this game, this game was a pieace of trash."
3,Oh K its Blah!!!!,"Hmmmm....Let me break it down.This game is so stupid when you first turn it on!!!!I couldnt believe it when i bought it,then turned on crap.Then Characters look stupid and they dont even have the right poses.There details are very limited and very basic.However the background are beautiful on a GBA system.I played for 5 mins though and was hooked.The""will"" to get all the featuers in the game was the only reason I played this.Its fun when it comes to gameplay,but don't expect quality.You get music,screenshots,bios,and bonus options,but nothing good enough for the ultimate DBZ fan.BASICALLY:borrow your friends game or buy it if you love DBZ and portable 1/3 decent fighting games."
4,This is what expected,"Finally a DBZ game on GBA that gives us what we expected. DBZ Taiketsu will give us our fighting style DBZ game, that will sorta be like Ultimate Battle 22, though I know after that the game won't deliver the goodness of other fighting games, such as Tekken 4, but it will difanetly be a big seller simply because it's a DBZ fighting game, and it's DBZ. I seen screenshots of this game and it gives you your classic GBA grpahics you would get."
3,Just ok.,"The good news... these breadsticks are very light and crispy.The bad new... these breadsticks are pretty bland. I've had other unflavored breadsticks that still managed not to be bland so that is not the problem.If you are going to use these for dipping then you definitely will enjoy them but on their own they are just ok.One other thing, about 75% of my breadsticks arrived broken into 2, 3, or even 4 pieces."
2,Waiting,"I'm still waiting for the product to arrive after almost 2 months, why does it take so long?But I love the show and hope its good"
2,Errors By Omission,"Unfortunately, this book is a flawed reference for the average collector and damning to advanced collectors with rare, original variations of German headgear. Many original examples of highly collectible headgear are omitted and the authors often leave the reader with the false impression that what you see in this book is the final word in originality. Half of the book does have an interesting section concerning the different hat makers of the period, thus providing some minor redemption for the publication, along with good photography of limited examples. Overall, the book is of narrow scope from incomplete research and laced with errors, many by omission."
5,Wonderful,"Well this story took place in The Flash issues 108 to 111 and Impulse issues 10 and 11 and have been collected here. The story is about Savitar who is in his own mind the God of speed, and when he finds out others are using the speed from the speed force and so he cuts them off...All but wally west The Flash and thats when all hell breaks loose. This story has it all, lots of speedsters like the first flash and others and you have ""Speed Ninjas"" who work with Savitar so all in all you get a good story with lots of the ""Flash family"" in it. Also you have the death of a few speedsters as well so if your a flash fan you will not want to miss the story about that.My one problem with the book is that it has a cliffhanger ending! trades should never leave the ending open like that because you buy a trade for the complete story not cliffhangers. but DC comics have published the second book ""Race againist time"" so you might want ot pick it up at the same time if you want the whole story."
4,Termial Velocity Was only the begining,"Amazing. For you Flash fans out there, this is a must have. What began with the onderful story line of Terminal Velocity is continued and expanded upon here. The speed Force is being stolen from speedsters everywhere and only Wally can stop the man responsible. Everybodys here; Max Mercury, Impulse, Jay Garrick, Jessie and Johnny Quick. For those of you who loved Termial Velocity, this is in every way a second chapter in the growth of Wally and the revealing of ""The Speed Force"""
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Max Mercury is the zen master of speed. Savitar is the opposite, an evil zen master of speed. He has many fast allies he has gifted with speed powers, due to his high level of control over the Speed Force.Wally must recruit allies of this own, as many of the Flash family as possible, in order to oppose this madman. Speedsters abound in this Flash-fest."
2,Doesn't really fit right,"It's not bad, but not great either. Doesn't fit quite right and difficult to install. Could barely close the hood."
4,"Fun, but a bit of a rip off compared to other seasons","There are some classic episodes of PMR on here; in particular the Rat-infested AMC Pacer story, and the ""Grifted by Grandma"" Buick Century that gets turned into an old-school hot rod. (There are also two episodes from this season where it was revealed on a ""Where Are They Now?"" Special [not available on any DVD], that two of these freshly pimped cars were totaled soon after completion, giving those shows an interesting vibe when watched with wiser eyes). This is also the last season at West Coast Customs, which I personally prefer to the later episodes at GAS, which were more silly than technical.My only major beef is that this season is short--only eight episodes compared to the others, which have 12-18 per season, yet Season Three retails for the same amount."
4,good collection,this book is a great collection of stories from around the world. anyone would enjoy reading it.
1,never worked,"the game didnt work but they were fantastic with the return, excellent customer service. i would consider them again definitely"
4,Carmen Sandiego PS2 Game,Kids age 7 and 10 seem interested. They want to get to the next point. Moves along at a good pace. Not exactly like the cartoon though!!! Very different premise and characters!
5,Simply The Best,"I am extremely fussy about the quality of literature I read to my children. We have a huge bookshelf full of children's books. This one takes the prize on so many levels;1. Quality and beauty of the writing, its use of poetic words and sentence structure.2. Not dumbed down for children, therefore challenges their thinking and imagination, while also retaining its original messages about virtues and goodness.3. Exquisite pictures.4. Keeps my son's attention more than anything. He has learnt far more from this book than any other.5. Not boring for adults who have to read the stories unteen times!I have not found a better version of the Grimms fairy tales.Some of the stories do contain some gory details, but if the parent feels they need to, they can easily miss a paragraph without losing content.After reading Archipova's fairy-tale versions, it's difficult to return to other books, since everything else thereafter sounds inferior to the ear!"
3,Guitar flat capo,"It is very good ,but I don't know why it is not supplied with an adjustable metal clip, as the strap is likely to lengthen in continuos usage , and a clip for adjustment is the cure,Anyway it is very well done,the metal is soft to the hands,A good investment for a low price"
1,Cheap and nasty,"I bought this for setting the action on my guitars and basses. It does what a capo is supposed to do, it frets the strings for you. The problem is the bare metal and hard edges, it is really easy to scratch your instrument with. If I was using a capo regularly I would not let it anywhere near my guitars."
2,Capo Po,"This is not the best capo I have bought. It is a little hard to get on and the rubber on the base is coming off. Not good. I made it work, but not really happy with this product."
3,"My first capo, too","This was the first capo I ever had, and I'm currently looking for a better one. That said, it works pretty well -- its main issue is that it tends to pull the strings over to one side if you're not careful, making them out of tune (or sometimes knocking the high E off the fret altogether). Also, it takes some time to put on. Still, it does the job."
2,disappointed,"The tape was informative, but where do find the hardware for the Kurtain Kraft. It seems that the hardware is no longer available."
1,Poor quality,"The quality of this software is poor. The voices trail off so it is difficult to understand what the characters are saying. When you first enter Blue's Room, there are no instructions that give options for play so you just click around and find things in a hit or miss fashion. When you get into a game, the game doesn't always work like its supposed to and if you play again game for longer than a minute or two, an annoying screen pops up asking if you would like to continue playing. Its a waste of time - save your money."
5,ASSAD Family Valves...Should Be The World's Values,"I COMPLETELY disagree with the previous reviewer. Maybe he was sitting on a nail as he was watching this concert????? The Assad family is talented, their women beautiful and on the whole this family CLEARLY shows what family is about. Song after song we see one talented member after another display their outstanding skills on guitar and piano, simply brilliant! A great concert that all in the family can enjoy. They sing just fine. If you want perfect go to perfectland. They shine and they devine. A classy concert indeed. A moment of pure love becomes a moment of pure joy. If you like great music check it out!"
1,Lacking in vocal talent,"Being an avid listener of classical guitar music, I jumped at this video when it was released. I've not put it back in my DVD player since the first time. This is an extremly talented family - all of them are well-versed on their respective instruments. However, none impressed me with their singing ability, and it in fact caused me to skip through almost every song on the performance, despite the impressive instrumentation. Sorry, but I just can't recommend it, despite the talented people. Singing on the concert platform is best left to professional singers, not dabblers in vocals."
5,Awesome!,"That's a fantastic book. For people who wants to learn about derivatives and finantial markets it helps a lot. Because the book has a lot of maths I do not recommend it for people who does not have a good math support. Still, I think it is a good buy. If you have any doubt concerning this topic it can always give you an aid."
3,Hull Options,"Explanations are fine, practice questions can be very technical. Not sure of the purpose of ""assignment questions"". Should only get if you're required because of school."
2,Not Sterling Silver,"This is one fascinating but frustrating novel. The Sterling sociology lesson is in full swing, but between the many treatises there is a sort of plot about a solar system torn in two by the genetically altered (Shapers) and the technically life-enhanced (""Mechanists""). They wage a political war and perform dirty deeds for the entire length of the book, meeting an alien race along the way. The main character, Abelard Malcolm Tyler Lindsey, survives the ages and finally just drifts off as an entity (a la Dave Bowman). There is a fascination to this novel--there are beautiful passages and interesting ideas, but this is hard-core Sterling and not at all an easy read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"There are two main political factions in the masses of humanity thathave spread to the stars. The Shapers, and the Mechanists. Thesefactions have two different schools of thought on posthuman alterationof the body, the former organic, the latter taking the cyborg route.They are not the only organisations that exist, but are the mostinfluential."
1,dissapointed,Very dissapointed with this product. I didn't listen to the last review that said the sizing was horrible-well it is horrible!!! I bought the infant size and my 3year old has room to grow and she is tall for her age. The quality is ok for the price.
4,good gold coupler,We remodeled our den with new hd items. I needed a coupler for our cable service to connect to the hd box. The steren gold was what i was looking for. It was ship fast and works great.
5,Steren gold-plated 75 ohm coax coupler,Nice quality product with smooth gold-plating that connected easily and firmly. Does the job well! Would consider buying more if needed again in the future.
3,"Dull, but thorough","I'm writing a novel set in 1930s New York and for research purposes, this book is a great starting point. But as for simply sitting down and reading it all the way through, well, it's a bit dull. For a better sense of the sweep and drama of New York's history, try tracking down New York Panorama, also put out by the WPA around the same time."
2,Chinese Water Torture,Beautiful cinematography. Glacially slow plot and narrative pace.One perspective on the human costs of the Great Modernization in China. Congratulations to the Middle Kingdom!Progress is here!
4,Very good menus and recipes,"This book is as advertised (actually, has more variety and more actually usable recipes without a lot of specialty ingredients or weird things the kids in the family will refuse than I expected).75 Dinners, 50 Lunches, 50 Breakfasts and 30 Snacks.Not a good book for Type 2 diabetics lmiting carbs (each meal is 50 grams of carbohydrates or more)--and definitely not for low carb dieters limiting themselves to 20 carbs a day.The intent of the book is to take some of the guess work out of meal planning. It fails to get 5 stars from me because I would prefer nutrition counts for each recipe instead of for each menu, probably unfair of me given book title but my family needs count exact carbohydrates and does not use the exchange system."
4,Aging boat owner,We are preparing an older boat for sale that we have cared for lovingly for 30 years. The boat is in basically excellent condition but when I saw this advertised I decided it might be of help to insure all is in order. We think it makes some good suggestions.
4,"Clear, concise, and well illustrated","While not as detailed as a textbook might be, it covers general points very well."
1,Huge WASTE of time!,What a waste of time this garbage ended up being. Mildly amusing for about 50% of the game- then it becomes a chore as you have to back track through 90% of the game to find areas that were previously unreachable. But the one that will KILL you is this horrible platforming level that you MUST complete to achieve the final security key- and it's clear that the game developers had no plans for you to ever complete it. It has everything bad going for it- so if you want to play a game 75% of the way through only to hit a monumental wall- then this game is for you- for all of the rest of you- don't waste your time!
3,Meh.. it's ok..,"This game is not bad, but if you want a good, cheap racing game, the Mustang one's better. This one is kinda slow paced. I got it so I could race my favorite Corvette, the '82, and YES I know the '82 was slooow for real and it is sloooow in this game... but what a body it has! Anyway, don't pay over $10 for this, whatever you do."
5,GOOD RACING GAME!,"We purchased this game for the xbox and have all enjoyed playing it. It has every corvette ever made up to the 50th anniversary corvette. It has great graphics, good 2 player mode and fun game all around. I give it an A+! There is tons of different vetts you can drive and my pick of vettes is either the 50th anniversary or the police vett! AWESOME! This game is under $10 bucks at most stores, you can't go wrong in buying it! Fun for the whole family! (I would have to give this game a good review since I only live 30 miles from the actual corvette plant!) But it really is a lot of fun!"
4,SOOO cute...but....,really hurt my feet. Maybe those of you used to wearing a little more uncomfortable shoes will fare better. Will wear them again but have to plan my day around my shoes.
4,Great desk,"I bought this desk about a month ago and I love it. It is very sturdy and not complicated to put together. This desk fits perfectly in the corner of my room.Anyone looking for a desk that is small, study and functional, this is an excellent choice."
5,identification cards of wild plants,"I have been following Linda Runyon for sometime, and these cards are awesome, they have pictures and information about the plant's."
2,Playing cards????,"Doesn't anyone realize that these are useless as playing cards? I was hoping I could have fun learning edible plants while playing my favorite card game, but each card has a unique backside! A couple rounds of your favorite game and you have them memorized! These are great if you simply want flashcards, but as playing cards they are useless."
5,Take them with you whenever you go walking!,"This deck of 52 information cards is the perfect companion for Runyon's book, <em>From Crabgrass Muffins to Pine Needle Tea: A National Wild Food Field Guide</em>. Held together by a key chain, the cards are great for taking along on a day hike or long camp out. Each card has a color picture and name of a wild edible plant on one side and uses, warnings, and preparation methods for the plant on the other side.My daughters and I take these with us whenever we go walking and they love playing games with them. As we walk, we try to spot the plants on the cards or use the cards to identify plants we see along the trail. Because the cards are strung together on a key chain, the girls can carry them around and I have no fear of losing any of them. --Lucy Watkins"
3,Wild foods,"The pictures could be larger and clearer with more details and with a larger card. In addition to them you MUST have reliable books/resources including hers for identification. If your going to use this as your only resource without double checking you just might end up dead.""Uses"" and ""Hints"" are good. And idea to have such information in cards are great!"
5,Good learning Tool,I think this is a good way to learn/teach about edible foods that can often be found in the wild.. There may come a time when this information will be extremely useful and important to know.
5,Excellent source for wild plant identification.,"Pictures are great; information is easy to read. Cautions are appropriate and guidelines for preparation are clear. Because they come already laminated, this is a great set to get and go out with."
1,Terrible,This book was terrible. The author waste my time. He didn't know much about Montana so he should have kept this to himselve.
1,"My definition of hell: to be handcuffed forever to the writers, cast and 5* reviewers of this film.","I bought this dvd because I'm a Dustin Hoffman fan, I heard the film was off beat and kooky, and photos showed Hoffman clowning in a goofy wig. I loathed all the smug, pretentious and constant misfires, with the breakneck speed of the patter concealing the slipshod construction and expositions.. Very narcissistic, with cheap and pretentious blather about the meaninglessness of human existence, with no coherent plot and not grown up. It was like throwing handfuls of mud at the wall to see how much would stick. I bailed out after 40"" --- much later than I should have. I'm aghast it was praised by so many people. Awful!"
1,Sucks...Wrong Item,"This is supposed to be a PSP car charger, It most certainly is NOT. It was a sidekick charger. At least thats what it was labeled as when it came. But, I have a sidekick and it doesn't even fit that! Waste of money, I got it around Christmas, so things were too hectic to send it back...Lost my $$$."
1,Graphs and Applications with CD-ROM,"While the inventory on these is very low. I wouldnt recommend buying it from this lot. I received my first order and it was missing the CD. Amazon was great at getting me a return label and another shipped out immediately to replace it. However, the second order came and it too was missing the CD:((( I ended up having to buy from the school bookstore so I would have the book and CD as advertised for my class:("
1,Are you under 21?,"If so, you may find this book revealing and deep full of witty observations. If not, then bypass it. He seems to be writing to people who have never thought about anything. Ever. It's a self-congratulatory book, and he's not interesting enough to be self congratulatory. It's obvious at best and dull at worst. He's guilty of doing exactly what he mocks; pretending that saying how uncool you are automatically makes you cool. And he's far too old for that. Contrived and already done thrice over, I'm going to find him so he can pay me back the money he owes me for buying this book. And I know right where to find him - on the LES."
1,Don't Waste Even 15% of Your Time.,"This book is annoying, self-absorbed and boring -- a lot like the guy who wrote it.No one cares about Chuck Klosterman's love life, or any % of it... fabricated or true."
5,So much Fun,"An awesome book, was SOOO much fun. You really love the author by the end of it and he really makes you feel like you are apart of the whole thing. His randomness is awsome and the only problem that I had with the book was the comment he made about Shannon Hoon."
4,Klosterman at his best.,"I like Chuck. This is his best book. It follows a narrative so his complex musings on music and the men who have died making it have a cohesion lacking in his previous works. I suppose some prefer the random ruminations he proffered elsewhere but this book is the real deal. His quest is a story about music makers who have died tragically. Duane Allman in a motorcycle accident in Georgia. Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper in a plane crash in Iowa. Cobain in Seattle. He embarks on a journey across America to investigate the scenes of the crime and invites the reader along for an entertaining and enjoyable ride."
3,"Unfathomable, in a not so good way...","Overall, I guess you could say I kind of enjoyed it...However, I was really suprised to see how he wrote endlessly about himself. This book is completely lacking an insightful, charming, and inspiring voice - like I thought it would have. There were very few ""laugh out loud"" moments and I just found that I couldn't wait to finish reading it. This book didn't have any realism; any soul. I felt like he was just talking out of his butt, so I found him hard to fathom, hard to grasp, and hard to relate to. Whether this is 85% of a real story or not, he didn't give enough analysis or honesty for me to believe any of it."
2,I should have given up earlier,"I flipped through the book in the bookstore and thought, ""oh, this sounds kind of cool"" when I got to the part about cocaine people and pot people, because it was funny and ironic and pathetic and he knew it. Some of the book was really interesting; specifically, I liked when he talked to strangers. His boring romances are boring. Why are you wasting my time? I finished the book hoping he'd say something worth reading. The only thing I'm going to remember--of any worth, anyway--was his description of intelligence as ""knowing what to do without being told,"" which was actually quoting Nixon about Kissinger. Nice.I just wish he were a little smarter. Then it could have been a good book. Until then, stick with Spin, Mr. Klosterman."
2,"an entertaining one-time-only read, or a great way to kill time in an airport","Chuck Klosterman has the kind of literary journalism style that is usualy only found on self-indulgant blogs or pop-culture magazines that people forget about once they reach drinking age. While his writing style will keep the reader interested, it seems he doesn't have the ability to write about anything without writing about himself first.Reading the back cover, one would think that this book was about death, drugs, and rock n roll, however Chuck only mentions those things in between rambling about all the women he's loved before and why he can't let go of any of them. Future ex-girlfriends: beware. Chuck needs to let go and grow a pair.If you're looking for a good rock 'n roll experience, go elsewhere. If you're looking for another reason to hate rock journalism, check this book out. If you happen to run into Chuck Klosterman on the street, punch him in the face for me. I'm sure he'll write about it."
3,still good,"A lot of people have knocked this book because it's not about Klosterman's trip to see sites of rock-star deaths, and more about his relationships with girls. But he says this in the first few pages!What people should be complaining about is how it goes from a really good read to ""concluding"" so quickly, like the floor just drops out from under it. It's good, just not great like SD&C; and Fargo. I think if he added about 20 more pages to properly conclude the book, people would be happier about it."
2,Missed Potential,"I bought this book after enjoying Chuck Klosterman's Fargo Rock City. The concept of the book (taking a long road trip to locations of rock and roll deaths) is excellent and if executed correctly would have been great book. I expected insights into the deaths and the locations that could only be found by exploring them up close and in depth, which is something most of us will not have the opportunity to do. Instead, Chuck Klosterman has a road trip where he waxes about his many dysfunctional relationships with women in between destinations. There are a few spots of humor and insight, but not enough to overcome the off subject exposition. The best analogy I can come up with would be buying a cookbook, and then having the author devote the majority of the book to what kind of car he drives to the grocery store."
2,Too self-involved,"Having read Klosterman's other two books and loving them, I was excited to hear his take on the phenomenon of rock stars finding fame through premature death. Instead, I got a book that devotes roughly 20% of its pages to this topic and leaves the rest for Chuck to fill with self-pity and neurotic tales of heartbreak.It's impossible not to compare this book with Hornby's High Fidelity in its discussion of music as a vehicle to examine past relationships. However, where Hornby succeeded in creating a lighthearted, funny novel filled with introspection that rings true and original, Klosterman's attempt comes across as a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to exorcise his demons at the expense of this reader's patience."
3,Love life = boring.,"I was fascinated when I saw the synopsis for this book, and I generally enjoyed it. However, I agree with many of the previous posters in that I don't care about Chuck Klosterman's love life. I found myself bored and annoyed with these passages and wondered why he spent so much time obsessing about women who didn't return the favor."
3,Eh...,"I have read all of Chuck's books, and I have to say that this one was not my favorite. I got tired of hearing about the girlfriends, and the complicated relationships; I wanted to hear about RAWK!The idea is fantastic, and had he followed through with that original idea, I probably would be writing a completely different review. Somehow we end up hearing about 3 lame chicks for the entire trip. Ugh. It was like taking a road trip with your friend that just got dumped, but only it was, like, 6 months ago, and he won't stop obsessing over it.Boring.Read this one first so then you can read, ""Fargo Rock City"", and ""Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs"". That way you won't end on a low note."
3,"I'm still a fan, but....","I loved Fargo Rock City and Coca Puffs, but thought this was a little bit weaker going. The writing is great, but the story as such is just kind of not there. My personal feeling is that Klosterman needs to get a little more honest if he wants to attack this type of subject matter. It's still pretty funny, but feels a little forced. Personally, I liked the book Wrecking Crew by John Albert much more this year. Still a fan of Kosterman, but Wrecking Crew just seemed a better book."
2,Thinly veiled excuse to pen his autobiography...,"I love rock music. Apparently, so does Chuck, the author of this book. The story had so much promise - a roadtrip to track down landmarks where rock stars died in tragic ways.But the number of pages devoted to the objective is small compared to the bulk of the book, in which Chuck re-""hashes"" his really boring life. This guy is a rock critic, not a rock star. His life is tame, his problems are trivial, and no matter what the topic, he always brings the discussion back to the subject of himself.I received this book as a gift, so I felt obligated to finish it."
1,A waste of a great premise,"I purchased this book after reading, and enjoying, Fargo Rock City.I was expecting a book about music and fallen rock Gods. Instead, I got a mashed together book that I can't believe was written by the same guy that wrote Fargo Rock City. Please note: IF YOUR INTEREST IS IN READING ABOUT MUSICIANS THIS IS NOT YOUR BOOK. If your interest is poor-me droning from a guy that avoided his initial assignment, this book is for you. A huge disappointment."
2,Entertaining with no substance,"This book turned out more like an entertaining road trip than offer an insight into the deaths of rock stars, with the bit about Cobain being the best written part of the book. The rest of it is just like listening to your girl-crazy hipster friend who just came back from a road trip - it definitely made me wish I worked at spin so I could drink my way across the USA while yammering on about why I think what music I like is clearly poignant. What a charmed life these 'critics' lead!"
1,Don't waste your time on this drivel!!,"My God, Chuck Klosterman has confused himself with the supposed subject of his own book!! What a narcissist!! The fact that such a weak and unimaginative writer has a column in Esquire says much about the low level of contemporary American public discourse. Avoid this one."
2,Killing Yourself to Live : 100% BS,"The premise sounded promising, but Chuck Klosterman is a hack who oughta tear himself away from the television and People magazine and pick up some classic literature. I can say with all honesty that if Spin had given me this assignment, the results would have been far more intriguing.As much as I wanted to enjoy this book, I found it intolerably annoying and self-indulgent. What a shame."
1,"WORST ""BOOK"" EVER!","Even one star is too good for this book. Maybe I had too many expectations for this book. Maybe, as a real music fan, I had my hopes set too high that I would actually learn something or experience something thru Chuck's journey. Instead I got bored and angry. Chuck is a horrible writer and only a small percent of the book actually has to do with his assignment. Sadly, he does not even appreciate the people whose deaths he's 'investigating'. Chuck is a pretentious wannabe who thinks the world revolves around his ugly mug.If you want to hear about this loser and his non-relevant, self-indulgent ramblings about his own death and his girl issues, read this book. Otherwise, save your money and just take the journey yourself. You're much better off."
5,"A short, helpful review.","The bottom line is that this is a great book. Whether you will enjoy it depends on what you are looking for in the book you read. Many other reviewers have not incorrectly complained that the book lacked continuity, & was advertised in a deceiving way (it focused much more on personal musings & failed romances than it did mortality). I wouldn't necessarily recommend the book for those who haven't read Klosterman before; you should know what you are getting into & be prepared to weather long, self-indulgent, & sometimes obscure/drug induced anecdotes. That said, the book had me laughing out loud probably more often that any book I've read before. If you are looking for a book about rock & roll deaths, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy Klosterman's witty yet unabashedly odd humor, you will love this book."
4,Funny Stuff,"This is the first book of Klosterman I have read. I read his articles when he used to write for Esquire and they were pretty good. This book is basically a about Chuck's road trip visiting different places all over the country where famous and not so famous muscians died. During the course of his trip he writes about his romantic issues, drugs life philosophy and pop culture. This book is a quick and easy read. Its not the most profound thing I ever read but it is fairly entertaining. Chuck has an interesting view of pop culture. If you are on the fence about this book I suggest finding some of his magazine articles then if you like those get the book. I look forward to reading Chuck's other books."
2,Zero focus,"Just not a very good book. It's supposed to be a lot about dead rock stars and what it all means to our hero-worshipping culture - especially when they're gone - but mostly it's a couple hundred pages of Chuck's drive across the country, some memories of old girlfriends, a weird meeting with one ex and a couple of dinners at places like Cracker Barrell. There's little about the dead rockers themselves, and this kind of ""Chuck on Chuck"" navel-gazing turned into a cliche for Chuck about, oh, six or seven years ago but he just can't give it up or come up with much new material."
3,"Mildly entertaining, self-involved stream of consciousness from a little boy","I love reading Chuck Klosterman in Esquire. In fact, I thought he was a late-fortysomething until I read this book and found out he's younger than me. This book is pretty entertaining in the first 1/2, and then it just has nothing to do with music or his original intended purpose of driving around the US writing about dead rock stars and their death locations.What irritates me about ""Killing..."" is, I guess, Chuck himself: Stringing along 3 different women across the country; his remark that all women who accuse men of rape might be insane, and lying, and should be checked for this (um, they are, chuck!); and dissing Elvis while glorifying Chuck D.Ultimately, this tome is a little, immature boy stuck in a thirtysomething's body, who got to drive around the US and recording his every rambling, irrelevant,thought, and being paid for it."
4,Killing Yourself To Live,"Briefly: I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the writing. I enjoyed the references to musicians and other cultural icons. I disagreed with many, if not most of his assertions about the the value of certain kinds of music and musicians, but I enjoyed reading them nonetheless. I didn't mind the fact that much of it was an examination of his own relationships with women. If that's what he wants to write about, fine. I think he had interesting things to say about those relationships and I enjoyed reading them. I kind of feel as though I learn something about myself when I hear about how other people deal with relationship issues like this. I think the people who have written negative reviews were basing them less on what the book is than on what it's not. Anyone considering buying this book should be aware that it is not about music history. It's a funny (IMO) book about one particular guy's views on music, pop culture and his girlfrieds. I liked it."
2,Completely forgettable.,"I loved ""Fargo Rock City"" and ""Sex and Drugs and Cocoa Puffs"", but I was disappointed with ""Killing Yourself to Live"". It's like a Spin article--relatively entertaining while you're reading it, and then you completely forget about it when you're through.None of the characters were particularly likeable (including Chuck himself), which is something that can save a book if it's lacking in other areas. Plot? A very weak one that isn't even the main focus of the book. The subplot of the women in his life was also equally weak; he builds it up like he's going to have a revelation, or something's going to happen, yet nothing does.This book could have stopped halfway through or it could have kept on going and going... it wouldn't have made a difference. It would have been just as unforgettable."
2,"And now, more about me...","So very po-mo. Ostensibly about a writer at Spin visiting places where rock stars died. However, that was just a sub-plot as the book was about Chuck Klosterman. It was somewhat interesting but seemed like more of a blog than a book."
4,"Amusing, thought-provoking introduction to Renaissance Italy","The Martones have provided clear, graceful, & funny translations of Italian Renaissance tales in the tradition of Boccaccio. Excellent introductory or background reading for the period, plus you may want to retell some of the stories to your friends! Authors whose novellas are in the collection include Bandello and Sermini"
4,good,this was given to my daughter as a gift. She plays this game for hours at a time. She appears to enjoy this game.
3,Disgaea,"I was told this game was better than final fantasy tactics, not even close.but It is actually a worth play"
5,A World of Entertainment,"Disgaea: Hour of Darkness is an awesome videogame. There are multiple main characters, plus many other characters that you can create. The storyline involves a contest for who will rule the Netherworld, and the play mostly involves fighting on boards with various set-ups requiring different characters and tactics. The game is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but much more complicated. One can ""go into"" items to raise their level and to capture Specialists inside them. (This is similar to entering dungeons.) This is our favorite videogame of all. If you like strategy and tactics, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Good, but not worth anything over 50 bucks","This is a pretty sweet game, but it's not worth purchasing for over 50 bucks. That is a rip off."
3,A gallant try.,"But the characters are too small on the screen, multiple views during combat still dont show certain angles that are needed, and the cuteness level of the game is way more than I thought it would be and too much to play for long periods of time. Rent it first before buying is what I should have done and I would have saved 50$. Otherwise the game is good but just not a good or large enough interface."
2,Not that great.,"This game is one of the reasons that made me realize I should research things before becoming impulsive and spending my hard earned money on crap. Not that this is total crap. I was attracted to the anime. And it does have some humor in the storyline, and sounds.However when I started playing, I realized that the game play was too much like playing puzzles. Gets redundant and dull and boring. And the music is annoying. Just not my type of game but that's just my opinion. I prefer Final Fantasy type RPGs."
5,Sahara Desert Hill Country Boogie,"This Music shows how connected Southern Black Blues music is to the Motherland. THESE GUYS SOUND LIKE THEY WERE RAISED IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA,But they are from the Sahara Desert in Africa,no doubt about it. They rock and boogie Just like John Lee Hooker or RL Burnside with a strong african/arabian sound! THIS IS GREAT MUSIC!"
3,Tinariwen's latest outing,"This collection of songs does not seem as crisp or fresh as either of Tinariwen's earlier releases. But, I have seen them live twice since their last album came out, and nothing can match the energy, intensity of this group live. The album is a good solid effort; I'm enjoying listenting to it. If you are a Tinariwen fan, so will you."
5,One of the best Southern Gospel Quartets from the 1950's .,"Outstanding Southern Gospel Quartet from the 1950's. James Blackwood is still strongly associated with gospel music. The world's greatest bass singer, J.D. Sumner made a major contribution to the sucess of this quartet. I hope more of their music will be remastered to additional availability of CD's so all can hear one of the best quartets who have ever performed. Maybe Bill Gaither will take this challenge."
4,Pretty good Southern Gospel singing.,"They weren't quite as sensational as the Statesmen, but the Blackwood Brothers were far ahead of the other groups in their field, especially in their heyday. Without question, James Blackwood, even today at age 79, remains the finest lead singer in this field of music."
3,You could do better,"This book is a very easy to read little set of ""wise"" tidbits, told through anecdotes (mostly about very ""improtant"" multi millionaires and anonomous famous people. The book is broken up into three sections: Magic words to say to yourself; Magic words you say to others; and finally Magic Words universal. Nothing really profound and its not very deep. Neither of the co-authors have a background in Psychology, so I sort of wonder what the base their authority on. If you really want something like this, but more insightful, try either ""Dont Sweat the Small Stuff"" or my favorite ""Finding Joy: 101 ways to free your spirit and dance with life"" All three of these are based on the same premise of changing yourself and your behaviors so you can enjoy life, but the last two are just MUCH better."
3,Great resource for job seekers,"I have the '96 Edition of this same book and have used it so many times. I purchased the 2005 edition thinking I would be gaining more information. Although what's in there has been updated, the sections I referred to most in the '96 edition were the same. However as a first time user I'd highly recommend this resource."
1,Lousy book,"This book is lousy for non-entree level job-seekers. It talks about attire, outlook etc. that one usually knows if he/she has worked before. It gives no solid avenues for locating jobs. If you ask me, don't get this book...it is not worth your money."
3,Okay,"I got knocked dead from boredom, I got better advice from a 2 dollar kindle book,Interview tips from a chronic job hopper. Thats from the same guy who wrote the hilarious Job Hopper bookMr Instability. I mean think about it who would know more than a job hopper! But anyway, there is some good advice in this book and the way I look at it if you take a little from each book and classes the better of you will be."
3,It works,"Well, it cuts biscuits and donuts OK, but for the price and looking at the picture, I thought it would be sturdier. I don't know, I'm a little disappointed in the quality. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Time To Make the Donuts,"Great little donuts cutter, and for some reason, very hard to find. My wife has been looking for years in our city. I finally found this one on Amazon. She is happy, but I am more happy, and a little fatter!"
5,Inexpensive stainless steel donut/biscuit/cookie cutter,"Glad to find this product at amazon, I have been looking for a donut cutter at the retail store and either they are very expensive or cheap and not stainless steel. This donut cutter just fit the bill and will not rust or change color or shape. I am glad that the donut hole center can be removable so I can use both for cutting cookies and biscuit and making mini sandwiches as well and not just one shape for donut only."
2,hard to release donuts,"Since there is no opening in the top, I found it hard to release donuts once I cut them... this despite greasing and flouring the donut cutter. I have had better luck with donut cutters that have an opening from above through which one can gently push the donut through if it becomes stuck (Ateco makes such a product). I will be demoting this donut cutter to biscuit cutter (by removing the area that cuts the hole, I can release stuck biscuits from above... (my biscuit dough is less sticky anyway). Not recommended."
2,Hole Cutter Does Not Fit Tight,The hole cutter attachment does not stay on. I thought that it would be larger as well...guess I should have gotten out my ruler and checked for scale before ordering.
2,Hole keeps falling out,The hole in the middle keeps falling out when using the product. I'm going to have use some pliers to clamp it down to keep it in place.
3,Middle hole cutter falls out,"I found when cutting using the center cutter, it easily falls out. I had to keep putting it back in. Annoying."
2,Shorty,The round cutting part isn't tall enough to make bisquits or donuts (too thin). At least I can make rolled Christmas cookies.
2,Cutter works but falls apart when using,"This is well made, nice stainless, but the center cutter falls out when using. I became rather frustrated with it. I even tried to tighten it with a pliers to no avail. I am ordering a different kind. Sorry!"
3,It's just okay...,"I would consider this product to be very strong and sturdy. I was excited about the fact that the hole was removable and so I tested out this product today. Let me just say that the hole attachment does not stay in the cutter and falls out easily. Also, they don't match up properly so you have to go back and take the hole out and re-cut the holes. There is a flaw in the design. When used separately they work great though so just make it a two-step process and you're fine. However, I would not recommend this cutter."
4,My official After-Shave,"I am very picky about my fragrance. One could just pick any brand name without having to know a lot about fragrances. But I choose to go for this masterpiece. The fragrance is amazingly fresh and masculine.Edit: Be careful in buying from the right seller though. My last purchase was a bit shady. Also, sellers are just increasing the price for no reason. $7 for shipping 2.5 oz? Really? Come on guys, be reasonable. The market for aftershaves is not very elastic."
3,A contrived mystery,"A lesser Carr from his late period. Fans may still like this mansion mystery, as it has the typical Carr ingredients - humour, romance and impossible murder - but in much more contrived form than usual. And I can't help the feeling that there's something very fishy in the murder solution, which in Carr's case, doesn't answer ""who did it"" but ""how it was done""."
2,"Great voice, small fire...","This was my second of Dalaras' CD and it came as a disapointment. Dalaras' voice is as fine as always, but latin music is not his realm. He sings so well, that I almost forgot what I was listening to, but on the second and third... runs I realized I miss something very important: the latin fire was not there. The Balkan spirit is too big and too strong to follow the sharp inflections of fire flickering. I had the feeling that he is trying to have the music his way rather than letting himself become transformed by the sound. Would you like rembetika via latin sound? I would not."
5,Just... wow.,"...I cried. Like a baby. And just...CLAMP, you are too mean.That last line without the ""kun"" in it just felt... slightly upsetting, but all in all, the translations were pretty decent.""That line"" made me cringe a tad, but I suppose there's worser ways to translate it.If you're a Tokyo Babylon fan, or X fan, or Subaru and Sei-chan fan, read it.And yes, you will most likely cry."
3,Larry Gatlin sings old & new with all his family.,"The best part is at the end when the brothers are joined by their parents and sister to sing acappela the way they must have sung around the family piano. Larry's originals about his change of direction are very valid. Not enough Gatlin, though. Lots of other old-timers who were special to the Gatlins."
1,This product is not acceptable,"Within a few days of installation, after hot weather, the product, intended to be 81 inches long, shrank about an inch and has wrinkles in the fabric about each inch or two that interrupt the seal. I will be looking for another brand. This also happened to the same product from this manufacturer that I purchased in the brown color."
3,Problems with the pad backing,"I have had some problems with the white backing coming off the pad. I have written to Meguiar's a few weeks ago asking how to resolve this but no answer. I'll look for another supplier in the meantime. When it works, it polishes OK. For the price I would like a better quality product though."
1,disappointed in quality of product,I just received the soft buff foam polishing pad. I am completely disappointed in the quality of this product. I didn't even finish polishing the hood of my truck before the hook and loop fabric came unglued from the foam pad. This happened on both the pads I received. I expected a better quality product from Meguiars.I've been using Meguiars products for many years and have never had an issue until now. If all the pads are like this then what good is the buffer?
3,hook and loop polishing pad,"Haven't used it yet because I'm still looking for the interface to hook on my buffer wheel...I bought something for that and I'm still back to ""square zero""...you would think that in the marketing of this sort of product the seller would fill in the gaps on the other things you need to hook everything up. Not sure I can use it without buying a totally new buffer (which I really don't want to do, since I just bought one). If you already have a hook and loop wheel on your buffer, this product may be just fine."
3,It is okay,Cleaning needs a lot of workIt is pretty expensiveMay not buy againHopefully I can buy some which is cheaper and are disposal
2,I Tried...I Really Really Tried.,"Being a die-hard fan of the Fleming canon, I have flirted in the Bond novels written by other authors. I have a lot of respect for John Gardner as a writer and have read other Gardner/007 novels. I also must acknowledge that he must have been on a one-a-year contract which is a lot of pressure, I understand being a writer myself. I gave Brokenclaw a lot of chances, but it fell short for me. When reading a 007 novel, I can't help but picture in my head Bernard Lee when M is involved in a chapter. Yet when he speaks about the female agent Wanda who is infiltrating the criminal Brokenclaw, I can't picture Bernard Lee filling his pipe and saying to Bond, ""Cuckoo, which is Wanda's crypto...."" I tried, but Brokenclaw just didn't move me. 150 pages into it and I felt like it went nowhere. I will try some other Gardner novels and hopefully enjoy some of those."
2,A new low...,"The absolutely, mind-numbingly ridiculous ending to this latest Bond adventure could alone sink this book. It has some good elements but unfortunately they are completely wasted as a totally unconvincing and LAME love story and the stupid ending. Brokenclaw, the villain, has vague plans at best but Gardner does not seem to care about them or about giving us a slightly believable story in any capacity. M has a good role here, but again, everythng good in this novel is in the service of an overall lame effect and picture. Skip it and read one of the Gardner's better efforts, such as....anything other than this!"
1,broken after 1 year,"after few months used the seal broken inside can't see it yet but could heard it when i try to dump the old water out (after few times boil) don't know what is it at the time until the seal broken on the top of the pot, the whole pot have drop in with all the hot water in side the pot i unplug the power try to pick it up and dump the water the whole Bottom fall out, almost burn myself. not recommend at all, don't want to risk it again. could show the picture if amazon let me post on here."
1,"Low Quality, Cheap Product, Don't waste your money","I got the pot for a few weeks, and then have to throw it away - waste of money. The build quality is very cheap; the metal is very thin, very easily to get dented. The pot keeps reboiling itself when the water level gets very low, so eventually it damages itself."
1,Worst ever water heater,"Within one month I got this water heater, the automatic water dispenser stopped working. I hate all the troubles to return the product and so I just kept using it. It was extremely hard to squeeze the water out. Now it is totally dead. It is not even one year after I got it. Poor quality!"
1,Broke in just over a year - dangerously!,"I love having a water dispenser, and I got this one because it's cheaper than the Japanese brands. My mistake.The unit actually works fine for the most part. It boils water relatively slowly (much more slowly than a stovetop), and doesn't have temperature control. But while I had it I enjoyed the convenience of ready-to-drink hot water.Just yesterday the boiler just completely died. And not only did it break, it broke in a dangerous way.We got back and smell burning plastic, and found the plastic shell around the steel pot detached. Lots of pieces of plastic in the water. The button part separated. And had we not come back in time, it might've burned the house down.I refilled water just the night before so it didn't run dry.I expect it to break after the warranty like most electric/electronic appliances (sadly), but I didn't expect it to break so violently.Wouldn't recommend if you worry about safety."
2,Aroma Water Heater,"First there is no on/off switch so you have to unplug it when you want it off. Because of the large amount of power it pulls, it sparks when pluged in or unpluged. The cord was very bulky and the plug was large without a turn down so it would not fit well on my countertop."
1,Bad Smell,"Very strong plastic smell contaminating the water after a few uses, making it impossible to use. Avoid this product if possible."
3,Good until it isn't,"I was happy to spend less money than the Zojirushi counterpart, but I have had to replace two in the time it took for my original Zoirushi to wear out. The thing that concerns me the most with this product, is that I am noticing rust spots in the seams at the bottom and along the upper lip of the metal inside."
2,Mr.,Ad stated that this unit was HDMI uplink to TV. It is not and has been a hassle getting it hooked up correctly. Contacted the supplier who has been no help.
3,Not a bad deal if you have no other options,"I suggest checking your local college computer store for deep student level pricing, you can probably get this software for HALF what you would pay for here. If you have no other options to legally buy this software, then of course, this is a great deal."
5,Raw and funky,"As a funk enthusiast, I was completely satisfied with this album. The recordings manage to capture a live feel. Alice Russel's vocals on ""Step It Up"" are among the highlights. Fans of Breakestra will probably find that this suits their musical tastes."
4,"Purchased for business, but enjoying it personally","I purchased this CD for the song ""Step It Up."" The theme for Girl Scout cookie sales this year is ""Step It Up."" The song has a great beat and the girls enjoyed dancing to it. The rest of the CD is instrumental. It's a great CD to listen to while unwinding or cleaning the house!"
4,big disappointment,"As a big fan of Legacy of Kain, i have to say i was very disappointed with this game. The camera angles are horrible and there are alot of glitches. In one level, level 8, the glitch is so bad that you will have to start the game all over again.The game was entertaining, but more frustrating than anything if you have played the other games."
2,DEFIANCE: THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE LEGACY OF KAIN,The graphics on Defiance blows away any other Legacy of Kain game. The Final Chapter (for now at least)proved to be the best overall game of the series. I would play the game all over again
3,marginally disappointed,I was hoping there would be more thought provoking ideas and concepts. Most of what the author includes is straight forward parenting. Assuming you engage in parenting and take the responsibility seriously this book probably won't add much to what you're already doing. For others it will help.
3,Australian First,"apparantly, she is an Australian First artist... yeh like Liam says on Fake Songs:WHATEVERbut this track is really cATchy, yet u wonder what the hell she's singing about... Falling from wat...Well hopefully her debut will be spectacular...it's a great song written by Candice Alleybut after a few playz it gets boring"
5,No COP needs to be working with out reading this book.,"WOW !! This book is filled with over 500 fellow law enforcement officers providing imput on all types of traffic stop situations, and how to deal with all types of violators. To be able to communicate with and strategies for difficult situations..A must read. Every training dept. needs to teach all new officers right out of this book.........."
5,A Great Book!,"This book was recommended to me by the owner of a well known Native American Arts gallery as possibly THE best book on the subject, and it completely lives up to the recommendation. Based on a series of interviews with prominent potters from each pueblo, it not only gives an overview of the history of the different potteries, it is filled with personal thoughts and views of the various artists about their work--not only the processes of creating pottery, but their feelings about how they as modern potters fit into the ""history"" as well. If you are at all interested in Southwest Pueblo Pottery, you MUST read this book. It's not a ""picture book"" like so many others, though it does have many great photos, but it's not a scholarly text book either. I cannot recommend this book highly enough and I cannot thank my gallery owner friend enough for recommending it to me."
5,AN EXCELLENT BOOK MADE EVEN BETTER,"The previous edition was by far one of the very best books on the subject (see my review), but author/photographer Stephen Trimble has made this 20th Anniversary edition even better. He has kept all that made the last one great, and updated it by adding new photos and interviews with the new generations of potters, truly bringing this classic into the 21st century with more recent approaches to pottery making and the traditions from which this fascinating art arose.Even if you have the first one, this book is a must have for any student of pueblo pottery or any serious collector.Bravo!"
2,too sweet,"I think the cologne smells too sweet, and reminds me of that I would have worn back in the day to a middle school dance (obviously over done too). I recently wore this just to change things up and my girlfriend asked me if I was wearing Axe... Ouch!"
5,Wonderful!,This item was very reasonably priced and shipped very quickly. It ended up being a wonderful gift for my boyfriend that we both really enjoy! Thank you so much. We will shop with you again!
1,Eternity by Calvin Klein for Men,"I thought it would be better, but it doesn't last long, but the smell is good. May be i got a fake one from a seller, i don't know.Overall, i would say, not worth the money spent."
3,Check book area too small.,I bought this wallet in blue and wanted to carry my check book within the zippered area provided. I found the check book holder too small (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch length) to hold the regular size check and register. The wallet itself is of good quality but certainly did not meet my needs.
4,"Fun wallet, probably won't last too long","I really like this wallet, it's got lots of space and compartments for all my credit cards, cash, receipts and coupons, but it's not made amazingly well. Threads are already starting to come apart (I've had it about 2 months now) and I expect it will last me another year, maybe more. Pretty decent lifespan for the price, but this probably won't be a lifelong item."
2,Disappointed,"When I received this wallet (navy blue), it had a blemish in the leather, NOT the type that would naturally occur in the grain. It looked like a scorch mark as if the wallet had been laid against something hot. When I ordered this item there was a notation that it was the last in stock, (now on this site navy blue is still offered with no notation of it being out of stock). I suspect it was a reject that someone wanted to get rid of. Not worth the time or money sending it back, however I will never order again when an item is listed as ""last in stock"", and would be skeptical ordering from this seller again.Also, the leather on this item is less than paper thin. The only redeeming value of this wallet is the design."
2,Disappointing,"While the first two books of this series were passably original, this one is tired, hackneyed and ridiculous. So far, every book in this series involves a missing loved one, the three fates and a time limit on a quest. Also, the stories exhibit an exceedingly simplistic and narrow minded world view (the heroines are blond or redheads, and the bad women all have black hair, for instance). The language is too precious and the random introduction of french phrases is jarring."
2,So-So Retelling of a Fairy Tale,"The problem with the book is that I feel like I've read it before - and not the original ""Glass Mountain"" fairy tale. It is almost the same story as the first book in the series, ""Once Upon A Winter's Night"" - cursed young loves are separated through magical misdoings and one has to go on a quest to find the other (or find a cure) with a very specific time limitation. The lack of originality doesn't come from the fact that this is a reinvention of an older tale, but that it's a rehashing of a plot already worn thin.Even so, I probably would have enjoyed the story if not for the twee and hackneyed use of language - 'round instead of around, 'neath instead of beneath. Overly flowery and repetative speeches and palid characterizations make me glad I got this from the library. At least it's a quick read so I won't have to worry about late fees."
3,Disappointed...,The book was as promised with one exception. It smelled old and a bit musty...hard to give as a book. All other factors were positive.
5,This one trac is worth the price,"There are lots of great cuts on this title, but Cynthia Clawson's ""It Won't Rain Always"" defines it. I get a sense on that track, that something truly unexpected happened -- a few moments that really touched those present and that will touch you too -- I guarantee it."
4,the best of homecoming vol 1,"it is wonderful, as one would expect from gathier band. It is great to listen to going down the road. I sing along with the cd"
5,I'm the first to review this? C'mon people!,"Anyone familiar with Neil Gaiman's legendary ""Sandman"" books is doing themselves a disservice if they haven't picked up the ""Lucifer"" story. This ongoing (as of Feb 2004, anyway) series concerns the mechanations of the retired Lord of Hell as he sets his sights ever higher. Remarkable characters, plot twists, literary/historical references, and dialogue are all hallmarks of this series.Lucifer: Inferno is the fifth trade paperback in the series, and it covers issues #29-#35. Previous titles (in ascending order) are ""Sandman Presents: Lucifer,"" ""Children and Monsters,"" ""Daliance with the Damned,"" and ""The Divine Comedy.""My advice? Buy 'em all. Right now. You'll save on the shipping costs."
2,Not up to expectation,"I completed the original Kingdom Hearts game on my PS2, with the help of the guide made for that game, and was extremely pleased with both the game and the guide. Moving on to the next game for my PS2, Kingdom Hearts II, I immediately bought the guide to help me through it. However, the guide for KHII is nowhere near the quality of the original. I lost interest in it and hardly use it. It doesn't compare in the least to the detail in the guide for KHI so I am very dissapointed."
4,HIGH QUALITY strategy guide,"This strategy guide is one of the most high quality, detail oriented I've ever had the chance to use. There are TONS of graphics and a descriptive world by world guide. This is quite heavy, and the cover is somewhat like a box? I suppose the only negative is that since the book itself is heavier grade, the pages are a bit more delicate. The spine and pages needed to be handled carefully as to not remove them from the binding. Otherwise, you should be able to accomplish the entire game quite smoothly and quickly using this guide! Enjoy! This is one of my favorite games of all time."
4,Great book,"Very informative, has lots of detail, comes with many extras. Must-buy for any Kingdom Hearts fan."
2,Tedious Read,"I am currently reading this book. I found I LOVE periodic black novels and there are soo very few(Beverly Jenkins is the only other author I know of)I am finding the book slow and hard to follow, and I am finding it hard to grasp the concept, there is no explanation of the lead male Roget's character as to his intentions is one thing that makes no sense. With all the wording in this book, why then was there no provision for the man to express himself? I guess I am saying there is no clear sides to this story. As I said I am finding it hard to follow and confusing."
4,Works but too small.,"I bought this for my PSP and it works fine but my only concern is that it isn't a snug fit. I almost thought it was too small, but I had to force it in to get it to charge."
1,did not charge at all after 12hrs!!!!!!!!,"I tried the charger in both of my psp's and it didnot charge them at all!!!! no matter howcheaqp it was, if it dont work it isa waste of money!!!"
2,PSP AC Adapter,It is cheap and not really all that well made compared to the original adapter made by Sony. It works. Hopefully it will hold up over time.
4,Perfect replacement for lost/broken psp charger,"I lost the original psp charger so I was looking for the replacement from generic electronic store like frys, best buy, etc. The cheapest I could find was over 10 bucks. I bought this item way less than 10 bucks including shippping! It's not perfectly made, (light plastic material doesn't look durable) BUT it does what it supposed to do without any problem! I would recommend this charger for replacement of lost/stolen/broken psp charger."
5,satisfied mom,I am so satisfied with my purchase. Before I purchased the adapter my son would bother me all the time about charging his game now I don't hear a word from him about anything.
4,PC Adapter,"This is the same type of adapter, but made by a different company. The only problem I have with this adapter is for some reason it falls out of the wall socket VERY easily. I tried bending the prongs outward a little more and that helped somewhat, but it still barely hangs on. In your home that might not be such a problem, but being in the field in the military, people were always walking past and brushing by and it would fall out. It got pretty annoying. Other than that, its the same type that comes with the PSP. No other problems."
4,"Good product, an great price",The charger was for my son's psp. I loved that he could play is game again. It was listed at great price
5,Looks and feels cheap!,One thing for sure..it get the job done.All I need to power my psp .The price is right!Get if your low on funds...but I would honestly tell to buy official Sony product.I fear that this could over charger my psp.well so far none this has happen to my psp.but it could..You know the deal you get what you pay for! Injoy you psp...until you get a psp vita.
1,PSP AC Adapter,I wrote this review because the adaptor does not work. It worked for about 60 seconds and then did not work again.I would recommend that you seriously think about buying one from here.
3,great service,"This company is great, they sent this adapter out to me right away and it works great. Sometimes 3rd parties take their sweet time sending stuff out, but this company isn't one of them"
4,Better than the last!,"This trilogy started real strongly and then dipped a bit in 2nd book, and then took another upward curve in this latest installment of the trilogy. To me the first hundred pages is the best part of the entire story. I love when Kane and Co. get together with the indians. They blend real well together and, just like in several Deathlands novels, the indians are always great colorful additions to these novels. The rest reads like a Star Trek novel,(Which I think he wanted). It was good and interesting and well written, but I can't wait for things to get back on line. The next book sounds real good, can't wait!"
4,"I read it in one sitting, it was very thought provoking.","I was drawn to it as it opened up possibilities that seem very real. The whole web of deceit and counter deceit, you could feel Kane's delema with him.When every one has their own agenda and no one is going to be completely honest you have to do as Kane does and go with what seems right (true).Lots of side plots, twists, and turns to keep it moving and thought provoking."
5,Worthy of the Double Dragon legacy,"Double Dragon Advance is an improved version of the old arcade game, and the improvements are very welcome. Gone is the slow-down that made the arcade DD almost unplayable at times. The character sprites are subtly changed to give the game more visual variety, while still retaining the feel of the original. Elements from other games in the DD series are added seemlessly, which is a nice nod to the history of this video game franchise. There are also more weapons to pick up along the way, which helps quite a bit, as the game is still rather hard, even on the normal-setting. Of course, many beat'em ups can be rather unforgiving when it comes to difficulty, especially when played in single-player mode, so this is to be expected, though someone who is frustrated easily should probably pick another type of game. So if you're up for the challenge, and enjoy this genre, then I greatly recommend DDA to you."
4,Still Good,"This beat 'em up game is very old and this is suppose to be a remake. The 'remake' is more like added pic cut-scenes between levels. Gameplay wise graphic is not up to full potential of GBA, just look at TMNT and final fight one. The levels are nes quality, not even snes. The various charcters looks much better with good details and animation. Main player lee brothers have many moves. Weapons are fun to use. Music and sound is pretty original and decent. There are quite a few new enemies added like sword slashing samurai, suit wearing matrix dudes, shaolin monks. The fro chick is here of course, wish the hair had different variety. Overall this game is great, after you beat it you will still play it again, truly a classic."
2,It's A $1.00 Game...that's all its worth,"When you play, it takes 1 sec after you press the button for the action to respond. There are no special moves, no special effects, you'd find yourself doing the same stunts over and over again. There's really no variety of enemies, overall this game is only worth a dollar."
4,klein tape measure holder,"Good product. I use it almost every day. It could be narrower, so it would fit farther back on the belt."
4,Captivating and Intriging,"I bought this book from the author while at her book signing in Memphis, TN. I was somewhat hesitant to buy this book;however, I am soo glad that I did.This book is an excellant example of true friendship. The main character Shane has just lost her best friend and is haunted by a childhood secret. Throughout this book she learns that some secrets can eat away at the very core of your happiness and that you have to let them go and give them to God. Shane is truly a friend to Leslie, Raymond, and their families. I loved the character of Shane. I would love to have a best friend like her. This book also has a mystery in it, which adds some suspence. In the end, you will never guess the long kept secret.I highly recommend this book. It is funny, sad, suspenseful, and a quick page turner. This book is an easy read. So, go out and purchase this new book. Hats off to you Bre. Looking forward to more books."
5,India Meets Hip-Hop Very Hot,"The first time I peeped this track on the radio, I was like this here is the hottest thing I've heard since Hova's Girls, Girls, Girls cut. Big up to Panjabi Mc, this track will go down as one of the best of '03 mark my words."
3,"""The black Brad Pitt""???","Panjabi MC - ""Beware of the Boys"" (Sequence, 2003)The quote in my review title came from guest star Jay-Z calling himself that. Sorry, Hova, but no girl will ever liken you to Brad Pitt. Good freestyle otherwise, and this years-old song is remixed well with the ""Knight Rider"" beat, even though I usually turn this song off after the Jay-Z intro. -EJR"
2,Beware the Remix,"I have been a longtime fan of Punjabi MC and so i was enthusiastic to hear the Jay-Z mix of this great song.... and i hated it. The music seemed to have been slowed down to accomodate the rap lyrics, thus distorting the origninal flavor of the song. My advice is, listen to the original mix first, then get the rap remix only if you dont mind shelling out the extra bucks to get a subpar single."
3,"Not as good as ""Mundayan to Buch ke""","This a great song and all; however, I feel that original version of it (Mundayan to Buch ke) is much tighter. Jayz doesn't do much on this track, something like a 40 second ""diss JaRule"" rhyme, he could have done more. If you liked this track you should check out some other phat beats and scratches from Panjabi MC (the Backstabber mix with Daz Dillinger is off the hook). Jai Hind."
4,"Excellent Oirginal, Good Remix","I'm starting to wish I had known about Punjabi MC earlier. The song is pretty amazing, the Indian beat is top notch. The song is quite good. The Jay-Z remix can be a bit unnecessary, but J-HOVA does a good job of spicing up a great rap track."
1,ce jeu est une copie ou presque de sega gt 2002,ce jeu est comme une copie de sega gt 2002 sauf que il y a une option pour jouer en ligne contre d autres gens. pas gros d imagination de la part de sega...
5,Medjugorje Day by Day,I first purchased this book about 8 years ago. Medjugorje Day by Day is the way I begin every day. The meditations continue to speak to you in new ways every year. This book has become a way to teach others about Medjugorje and about prayer. We can not even count how many of these books we have given to friends and relatives. People have told us that this book has changed their lives and they have started to buy them to circulate to others!
3,Art scene in a messy city,"Interesting look at the New York film/art scene of the late 70s and early 80s. Though not compelling enough to seek it out unless you already have an interest.And man, NYC was a mess - at least the parts these folks lived in."
4,Finite Mathematics,Great experience with receiving this book in a timely manner. Need it for a class in Spring 2010. Hope I do well in the class!
4,a moving fantasy tale,"I read this book at age eighteen, and then read it to my younger brothers. It is an animal story, and a quest, complete with elves, but it is more, too. It shows how animals may view us, the supposed Protectors and Keepers of the earth, but the message is not hard to swallow. Filled with humor and sorrow, this book made a lasting impression on me, and will be a permanent part of my library. One drawback, I felt the ending was an odd change of pace. If you like this one, check out The Book of the Dun Cow."
1,Booo!,"Ok, I admit I smoke and drank alot in my twenties, but the stories I vaguely remember are much better than this dribble. Maybe I should write a book? All the talk about her poor hygiene, smoking, and drinking just makes me believe that if I saw her in public I would quickly move away from her. Other things she writes about make me dislike her as a person. I read chapter after chapter hoping to get any heartfelt emotion out of the pages, but no dice. Five star reviews and a New York Times best seller? I dont get it? Lame."
5,Funny. Really Funny.,"This novel is positively hilarious. Columnist Lourie Notaro invites readers to read little 4 page glimpses into her life. Notaro is maddeningly funny, and you'll feel embarrassed if you read this book around other people (as you'll be laughing so often). If you're a fan of Seinfeldian humor you'll love Notaro."
5,Perfect Pick-me-up!,"This is a very light, very funny collection of essays. Laurie Notaro is someone every woman can relate to, and somehow, at the same time, a rare, strange bird."
1,What's up with all the 5 stars???,"There are only 2 humorous things about this book: The book title and the chapter titles. I read through the book thinking ""ok, was that supposed to be funny?"". I kept reading though, cause I never give up on a book until I finish it. But this one has no redemption. It's a waste of your money and time even if you're reading it while taking a potty."
1,SO BAD.,"I bought this book after stumbling across it at the amazon.com web site...it sounded hysterical and had gotten great reviews and seemed like the perfect book for an upcoming cross-country flight. It was so not funny. So not original. Who cares about someone passing out on a lawn? I just didn't find the book even remotely amusing...my college/early-20 days were far more amusing to me than this book ever could be. In order to find this book funny, my guess is that you'd have to be there...it's one unfunny, unoriginal, uninspiring, half-assed inside joke."
1,Uninspired,"I read this book two weeks ago and can't even remember what I read. Obviously, not a great read. I bought the book because other reviewers on this site compared it to David Sedaris, who is hilarious. That was an insult to Sedaris. Save your money!"
3,Some funny parts.,"I thought it was overkill, but there were some laugh out loud parts. Good book overall, but not great."
1,Is a drunk really funny?,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have never found a drunk funny just really sad. I don't know what bothers me more, this book or all the people who thought it was so great on this site. Maybe Laurie's right, everyone does have a drinking problem...except me."
1,"It sucks, not my type of book.","This book is for girls that don't have a life of their own! I couldn't even finish reading it, it kept putting me to sleep. Save your $ and use it to live out your own life."
1,Amazon.com,"My problem is not with the book it is with Amazon.com. I am a college student and needed a book for my speech class. I had to pay full price for the book because the used copies did not offer overnight shipping, the differece was about $12.00 plus an additional shipping charge of $15.00. The following day I noticed that the book hadn't arrived so I tracked the package only to see that it wasn't dropped off at UPS until 9:30pm and they somehow expected that I would receive it the following day. Needless to say the book didn't arrive before I needed it. When it did arrive I refused to accept it because I only needed it for one class. I expect a full refund with shipping included, because it didn't come next day as guarenteed. This was my first experience with Amazon.com and will likely be my last. I also enjoyed that is so easy to contact the company with my complaint, if you can't tell that is sarcasm."
2,Maybe I didn't give it a chance but...,"I read a few entries into this book of essays or short stories if you will, on the mishaps of Laurie Notaro and friends. While some things were mildly amusing, (and by mildly, I mean very mild), I couldn't shake the feeling that I was reading the blog or the diary of a highly immature adult woman. Some of the things she writes in this book are similar to things that I found myself saying when I was between the ages of 13 and 15. I don't know what else to say besides the fact that her immaturity really irked me."
5,Mother & Daughter Quality Time,"My teenage daughter and I have had a bonding experience reading aloud Laurie Notaro's hilarious book, The Idiot Girls' Action Adventure Club. I think it must be a ""girl thing"" because I am certain that my son would not appreciate the antics of Laurie and her friends in quite the same way. It was wonderful to read the embarassing, funny and foolish tales of a fellow ""Idiot Girl."" We have all had those moments that now we can laugh at but I am not sure we ever want admit out loud that we were ever so stupid or clumsy. And I sure do not want to tell my daughter about MY OWN Idiot Girl incidents. Laurie does an excellent job sharing her stories in a way that can actually be educational for my daughter who is just about to enter her own idiot phase..."
5,A Must-Read for Any Girl With a Druken Past,"I started reading this book at a friend's house last night when I was supposedly babysitting her 6-year old. When the real babysitter showed up, I stole the book, went straight home and read until the ... I'd taken for my bum knee kicked in and I zonked out. I finished the book first thing when I woke up this morning. I loved this book! It is very funny and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a bit of a wild, drunken past (or present, or future, for that matter). I hope Laurie makes TONS of money from this book. I'm hoping she'll soon be syndicated!"
5,Not for the uptight ... reader,"If excessive social drinking, smoking and bad hair days offend you, then this is NOT the book for you. It's a great book for anyone who can remember the so-called ""good old days"" when your friends meant everything, you drank more than you should, and had no money. I took this book on vacation and would start laughing out loud -- my husband kept looking at me like I was nuts, then I would show him one of the stories and he would crack up too. Most stories can be read in about five minutes, so it's a perfect book for when you don't have lots of undisturbed time for reading (like when you have little kids asking you every five minutes for something like I do.) I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Non-stop laughs,"For such an obscure little book with an odd little name this was absolutely hilarious. The best part had to have been the candy apple incident. I had tears in my eyes. This book somewhat chronicles the writer's life and some of the more ""unique"" experiences she has had. Just the way she thought and the way the book was written was just too funny for words. I hope she has another one. Definitely buy it!"
2,Wasn't taken with this one,"Sadly, I am morphing into a finger-pointing old crone.Despite the fabulous title and clever cover photo, I didn't like this one much.The author is whiney and drinks too much and is lazy.Forgive me. I've become a finger-pointing old crone."
4,Just what we need!,"Funny, irreverent, tongue firmly in cheek - get ready to laugh if you read this book - probably out loud. I marked a few of my favorite chapters - ""How much it costs for a room of one's own"" featuring Martha Stewart, a desk and an authorization and ""More bread, please"" involving many rolls and ""On the road"" where she tells of her knowledge (not) about her car.Life is a series of ups and downs (mostly downs) for Laurie but plenty of laughs for us.Oh, the reason I marked some of the chapters? I'm sending this gem to my friend in California.Keep laughing."
5,"Total entertainment - witty, original and charming!","David Sedaris, Dave Barry and other assorted humor writers - I regret to inform you that you're no match for Laurie Notaro in the Humor with Attitude department. Hang up your pens, boys, Laurie's here and never mind the staggering walk and slightly slurred Stinkin' Drunk Step 10 speech.""The Idiot Girls Action-Adventure Club"" is a priceless read, outrageous and real in a way that Bridget Jones could only thoughtfully ponder in her diary. Check out Laurie's adventures in the public justice system while on jury duty, what her Nana really thinks of Bill Clinton, and why Charles Barkley thinks Laurie's very special. I laughed as hard as I could while reading this and when I was done, I laughed some more. Read it, enjoy it, and pass it on to your friends!"
5,Read this book and LOL,OK...this was the FUNNIEST book I have read in a long time. I happened to pick it up by the name and the picture on the front. It was a GREAT buy!! I have all my friends reading it now....I can relate to so many of the stories. I really hope there are more books coming. LOL funny.
1,Great if you read at a 5th grade level!,"I bought this book with great anticipation after reading the glowing reviews. I though it sounded like something I could relate to, stories that could have happened to me... only funnier. However, I was extremely dissapointed. Notaro is a juvenile writer, a poor story teller and her idea of funny might amuse a 5th grader or an 80 year old, but no one in between. I read about 3/4's of the book and can honestly say I didn't even crack a smile. I will be selling this on ebay as soon as I'm finished reviewing it. I do not recommend this read, stick to Sedaris if you want funny."
1,What a disappointment...,I was looking forward to this book being a lot like the female version of Tucker Max's books. It definitely wasn't. She is trying WAY too hard to be funny. Her stories are too short and NOT funny. I should have read other reviews before buying this one.
2,just not that great,"I really was looking forward to reading this - the premise was good, and many of the incidents described were humorous, but the writing was so bad that it honestly detracted from the stories she was trying to tell. I wouldn't mind reading her column in a mediocre newspaper, but for a nationally published book, the reader deserves better than this author offers."
1,Horrid!,I am so sorry I put down money for this thing. I scarcly would call it a book as it is more in line with one long drunkalogue. Notaro's effort is sad as she attempts to cash in on puking and smoking. To her credit she is clever at turning a phrase but the content of her work leaves one feeling revolted rather than amused. I really wish she had focused her talent more wisely.
1,Lame,"It's almost like the British version of Sex and the City. I must be missing something, I was bored."
1,I wish I had not bought this book,"I got a few chuckles, but mostly read quickly through her inibreation memories. I wanted to ready a funny book, not one about how stupid everyone else is, because she wanted to get drunk and not care about herself. I don't understand the reason behind this book. Wish I had bought a funny one instead."
1,Not impressed,"After reading some of the reviews, I expected great things. While it was cute in places, it was not consistently humorous.I have never read a book with as many typographical errors as this one."
2,I had such high hopes ...,"I couldn't wait to get this book and when I finally did it was a huge letdown.I'll admit, I did spend much of my 18th year binge drinking, but jeez, it really wasn't that hilarious -- and neither was this book.I can't believe that these essays actually ran in the Arizona Republic (or like we say in the news biz ""a family newspaper."")"
3,A little disappointing...,Cute but not great. A little too self-depracating. I didn't pass it along to my friends.
4,Laugh out loud funny,"This book not only made me laugh out loud while I was reading it, but I also felt compelled to read the funniest passages outloud to any person around me. (Which tended to occur every 5 minutes or so.) Her stories are hilarious and I recommend it highly."
3,"Adequate, not exceptional.","After reading ""I Love Everybody"", I expected a gut splittingly funny read. This was good for a chuckle, but little more."
4,Funny,"Not what I expected, but funny. I was thinking it would be more of a story, but it is a collection of shorts that Laurie Notaro wrote for the paper. Still, pretty funny and most women can relate!"
3,Falls short of my ideal memoir,"I am always seeking out another good memoir. Funny ones. While her way with words is undoubtedly eloquent, her storytelling leaves something to be desired. In almost every story, she is the comedic hero, while her friends turn out to be only props in her next race to to the punch line. Let your friends tell jokes, too! Because of this, the author has sacrificed what could be a genuinely interesting story only to remind us constantly that her hygiene and social grace are far outside the standards of any person she meets in her quest to make her pack of cigarettes last an entire chapter."
3,Decent enough read,"Love Laurie Notaro's writing style... very sarcastic, dry, and cleverly descriptive. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments in the book and a few really funny stories, but otherwise it was just okay. I'd say it's better off a library rental, but it won't scare me off from checking out Laurie's other work. I really liked her Christmas book... can't remember the title... Idiot Girl's Guide to Christmas, maybe?"
4,Review From An Old Fart,"I have read Notaro's books out of order. Although this was her first, I read it after a couple of more recent ones. I did enjoy this one and thought some parts were funny, but since I am middle aged and way past the single and young days, I could not like it as much as the others. Now that I have read The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club...I can officially say that I have entered Old Farthood. I found myself shaking my head and clicking my tongue...horrrifying, but true. If only Laurie had written this in the 80's. Anyway, there's a Laurie book for everyone. I'm reading them all!"
4,I laughed 'til I cried!,"I seem to be on a roll, reading laugh out loud funny books by incorrigible women, first Jen Lancaster and now Laurie Notaro. This is Notaro's first book and I literally laughed until I cried. The book is a collection of essays she wrote for the Arizona Republican; chronicling a few years in her life, through college and trying to become, more or less, a responsible adult. No one escapes unscathed; she targets not only herself, but friends, family and strangers. Her description of her teeth getting stuck in a caramel apple, while driving, is priceless. Another funny book for a bit of great beach reading."
3,Kind of Funny...,Was kind of funny. Not laugh out loud or anything. Sometimes it was just depressing. The woman who reads the book doesn't quite fit the character. Something was just off about it.
2,Sorry I bought this one,"I thought this would be funny, but it's mostly not. If you like reading about people getting drunk and smoking a lot of cigarettes, you might like this. It struck me as white trash ""humor"" and I couldn't even finish reading it."
3,funny in places,"I thought the book would be laugh-out-loud, knee-slapping hilarity but it didn't set me rolling on the floor. It made me chuckle in spots but was not an across-the-board romp. Laurie is a funny woman with a keen eye for the stories she tells, but the humor was a little base and I tend to get weary of the ""I'm fat and unemployed and misunderstood"" female commentary. That said, the book was not by any means a total loss. Just don't prepare yourself for an abdomen aching from guffawing."
3,I'm out of step with the world-,"I only found this book moderately amusing. I much preferred two of her other books, Autobiography of a Fat Bride and I Love Everybody. In fact, I did not finish this one."
2,Keep waiting for her to grow up a little...,"I read the entire Notaro series which was ok reading during my daily commute, jury duty, and a delayed flight. I was always left with the feeling of ""eh"" after reading each story. I was expecting more ""ah-ha"" and ""me too"" moments which really didn't come. I get being broke and drunk on ocassion during college and in my early twenties...eventually people grow up (not to say that you still can't have toys on your desk at 30, but you mature in other ways). She just doesn't seem to. I see there is another book coming in May. I don't think I could do it again. Maybe next time I'm summoned for jury duty. This book actually makes me a little leery of other blog-to-novel writers."
1,Seriously!,This author tries WAY TO HARD to be funny! I did not laugh out loud once. I guess I was too busy rolling my eyes! Not impressed.
3,Super Reader,"This series is meant as an Executioner spoof, and that is really exactly how it reads. Cherry Delight is not as much a hardcore weapons fanantic as Mack Bolan, but uses seduction and sex quite a bit more. Bolan gets lots of action, Delight gets extreme amounts of action. Quite a bit of this is part of her job.That is not to say this book is plotless, by any stretch. She is still tracking down, infiltrating and killing mafia types, as that is what she does. It really doesn't go way past what you will get in a lot of thrillers, just a bit more frequent, so presumably the authors were trying to get a bit of a balance."
2,Sweet but sappy,"I like the idea of this novel a lot.Hoping to escape his homophobic family and a failed love affair, a young gay doctor moves to a small, quiet Mid-western town. Almost immediately he's the victim of a gay-bashing--although he can't convince the town's hunky gay sheriff that the attack was anything but a random mugging. The truth turns out to be much more sinister than either man suspects.There's a decent mystery at the heart of the novel, but it's never adequately developed. Ms. Bell is clearly more interested in the relationship between the two main characters--which is fine--but unfortunately she resolves any possible conflict between them each time a potential problem surfaces. Nate and Brandon fall instantly and totally (and embarrassingly) in syrupy sticky love--and there are no obstacles to that love...so where's the story?This was clearly written with the best possible intentions, but it just didn't work for me. It's a first novel, though, so perfection is not to be expected."
4,Good but a bit over board! 3.5 stars!,"I hovered between 3 and 4 stars for this book. 4 because it is addictive and the plot interesting enough to keep you wanting to find out more and certain parts are engaging. It is after all a mystery plus drama plus gay romance. 3 because the solving of the crime seems contrived, the romance is too fairy tale like (though I am a sucker for gay romance with happy ending), the characters stereotype (the good guys are really just too good including the doctor and his sheriff, the sheriff's almost too perfect family and the bad guys are just too rotten). Still I did enjoy the book. Thus 4 stars as I think this is a debut and amazon does not allow 0.5 star."
2,Didn't keep my attention,"I read a lot. In my lifetime, this is the only book that I actually just put down between 1/2-3/4 of the way through. I'm sure its principles apply to some, but I didn't want to give it anymore of my time. My time is valuable, and I didn't find this to be something that was worth that expenditure."
2,Gaither CDs Joy in the camp and Down by the Tabernacle,The audio on these dates is not good. Scratchy sounds and background noise seems to prevail on several of the songs. I am thinking I paid more than they are worth.
4,A Bit Small,"My head is a size 7 3/8"" and this hat is a little small; I had to stretch it to get it to fit. Good looking hat that sits low on your head."
5,I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,"""Earthboy"" has it all! TenNapel just doesn't miss a beat in his newest and most inspired comic masterpiece. I am blown away at how his black-and-white artwork jumps off the page. I've read many b&w comics, but his style is simply the best I've ever seen. It's insanely detailed in some parts, and beautifully simple in others. And the story has everything you could want in a comic: an engrossing, heart-felt story, a ton of action, a unique lead character with an original power, never-before-seen settings and worlds, blah, blah, blah, etc...!!!! I can not wait to see this movie. (PLEASE tell me this will be a movie!) In short, if you read comics, DO NOT MISS THIS. I just know that in the future, this book will be revered in the same manner as such masterpieces as ""Watchmen"" or ""Kingdom Come."" No joke. Pick this one up now!"
2,Another Right Wing Rant by TenNapel,"I'll start this off with the two positive things I have to say about this book. First, the artwork is awesome. TenNapel's ability to do charactiture is almost on par with Eisner and Miller. Secondly, the characters are great. They almost live and breath on the page.Now for the negative, and this goes for every book of TenNapel's I've read with the exception of Tommysaurus Rex. His radical right wing views turn this book into just another rant. You don't have to look very hard to figure out who the real villains are in this story. Liberals, socialists and all the like are blamed for causing Jacobus' totally emotionless world without individuality. And I don't even want to get started on all the Christian Right undertones here. I totally disagree with every point of philosophy and politics that this man has.I would have loved this book if it weren't for that. If that nutball Micheal Savage were a cartoonist, he'd be Doug TenNapel."
3,"This is a booklet, almost like a thick tract","If you are looking for a solid, hardcore analyzation and polemic on the issue of plurality, this is not the text for you. This booklet is really small, not just in width but in all dimensions, but would definitely be good for evangelistic purposes, as a tract. If you are to order this, considering the warning, you should order multiples of it."
2,Burns one side,"From the reviews, I thought that this toaster would be a good one. I am sending it back due to the fact it burns one side of the toast while doing the other side normally. Very disappointed."
2,Toasts One Side Fine,I bought this because it looked the way I wanted and the reviews seemed okay. Returned after a week because it would only toast one side. I kept thinking the bagel setting must be on but it wasn't. Bought an Oster but now I'm thinking about returning it because it does the same thing. Doesn't anyone make a decent toaster???
4,Its a classic!,"I bought this toaster based on the brand name and the combination of features and looks. So far (its been 6 months) I could not be more pleased. The slots are nice and wide to accommodate bagels and I really like the ""frozen food"" button that allows you to tell the toaster if the item is frozen or thawed. I have found that this unit is fast and toasts food evenly.As for the design, I love this classic look because it reminds me of the metal toasters I grew up with. For once there is a ""retro"" product that seems like it will pass the test of time! Highly recommended!"
5,Best toaster around!,I bought this toaster because of the brand name and I just wanted a reliable product which would last. This toaster is the best I have ever seen. It is very easy and fast to use. And the best part I love about it is how easy it is to clean.Great investment and awesome value for your money!
4,Nice toaster,"I use the toaster on weekends only & I really like it. However, I get the impression that with daily use it would merit 2/3 stars, bc sometimes it toasts unevenly."
3,Free information for $15,"The information is good, but all of this is available online, for free plus eight hours of searching and research. So if you work full-time, buy the e-book. If you have the time, research for yourself through discussion forums and advertising."
3,Definitely for beginners,"I am a beginner in the industry and I felt most of the information was common sense and not specific to the industry. There was definitely some new information that I can use, but I don't beleive that someone already in the field would get much out of this book. It went so far as to explain how to keep records on paper. I definitely need something more detailed to follow this up."
1,Why pay for common sense?,This book is absolutely worthless. All it gives you is basic common sense advice. I don't know about you but if I'm looking at spending a few thousand dollars on a vending machine business I'm going to be thinking it through first. All this book gives you is the same information you would come up with yourself if you gave it a little thought. It gives you no real world advice on running a vending business that you can't think up yourself. Don't waste your money.
3,Vending 101,"This E-Book is good for someone thinking about getting into vending and comes across as geniunely interested in protecting amateurs from the snakes in this industry.I have plenty of experience in vending and knew 98% of the contents and so, for me, it was not worth the $15 I paid.The politically correct use of ""she"" and ""hers"" was also a distraction.An overview of the Vending market was missing and there is no list of references for the reader to do his own research.So, the E-book is good for rookies but people already familiar with the business do not need it."
5,Great for beginners,"To keep it short and simple; this is a great book for beginners. The information in it helps you to decide if vending is truly for you. Like any other business, there is more to vending than you can put into one book. This book gives you a great deal of important information without overloading the beginner.I believe Bryon has written a follow-up which contains more detailed information regarding obtaining locations and more. However, I believe that this is a top notch book for the beginner."
5,"Comprehensive, well-organized and honest","This book gives a thorough description of how to start and operate a small vending operation. The first chapter is perhaps the most important for novices, because it helps you figure out whether this is the right business for you, and whether you will be able to put enough time into it to be successful. The book is organized logically and systematically, making it easy to find the information you need in its 130-odd pages.The author takes an honest approach; instead of advocating cheating on taxes, he explains how to keep good records that will make it possible to substantiate legal tax deductions."
5,5 Stars all around,"This is a very well written book on how to start your own vending business. If you are curious about starting a vending business but have no idea where to start, then this book is for you. Not only does it get you started, but there are numerous great tips once you have your route established.The author is was also very quick to respond to a few email questions I had as well.I would highly recommend this book to any vending entrepreneur."
2,If it ever gets here..,"Well, I'd love to give this movie a shining review for being amazing, and so on. But instead, I have to do this here since there's no ""Leave buyer feedback"" direct from Amazon. I ordered this BluRay on Friday of last week, with overnight shipping for Saturday the next day. It never showed. It's 12:48am on Monday, and the tracking number for the package shows it hasn't even shipped yet. I wasted 18$ on overnight shipping, and I want my money back."
1,Hahaha..,"What a sad attempt at bringing an amazing anime to movie. It is entertaining but if you expect it to be anything like the anime, you will be sorely dissapointed. They have changed the characters around, (Personalities) taken some characters out and changed plot lines. If you have never seen the anime perhaps you will enjoy it. Else wise, blah!"
2,LONG forced trailers before the movie starts!,"Popped the DVD into my Denon DVD player and it started playing VERY long opening trailers...which you could NOT skip. Only buttons on the remote that worked were eject, stop, and power off.Tai Seng - the big US studios know not to do this in North America, maybe you need to learn a lesson.This was not a free DVD, it was purchased for me to watch, let me skip the trailers.Movie was pretty good, but I would have doubts about buying this DVD and supporting this sort of forced advertising on a DVD you bought with your hard-earned money."
1,"THIS SUCKS, PERIOD!","If you're a fan of the manga and/or anime, then you should already know to hate this movie. If not, shame on you. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT FOLLOW THE MANGA OR ANIME STORY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. On the other hand, if you never heard of Initial D before this movie AND are NOT a fan of manga or anime in general, then you *MIGHT* like this movie. Even then, you're better off watching The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Seriously, save yourself some money and stay away from this movie."
5,The one that raised the bar,"The is hands down the best car film. The innovative camera angles, mounted far shots right on the front bumper, to the deep and engaging storyline. Like most people, I bought this live action flick because I'm a huge fan of Initial D Manga and Anime. I was intrigued as to how they would be able to film and tell this story, mostly because it has a massive original story, to encompass that into 2 hours is most difficult. I believe the way it turned is excellent considering they had to change the storyline slightly from the original to have appeal as a standalone film. From beginning to end, this HK car flick is full of beauty, class, and professionalism, something not seen a whole lot in HK car flicks. Everything has a sense of artistic view, be it from mountain and Lake Akina shots, to the intense downhill battles, to the character dialogue. The camera work is absolutly stunning, and raises the bar not only for HK films, but the way they should be done here aswell."
4,Good quality dvd,I bought this bluray disk for my husband. He's pretty picky on picture quality and sound. So far I haven't heard of any complaints so I guess the quality must be pretty good.
5,good drift movie,"I never watched the animated series. I saw this movie a few years ago, my cousin had it and i loved the movie. One day I randomly decided to have a copy of my own and at $5 it was well worth it. If you like movies about racing, more specifically about drifting, im sure you will enjoy this movie.*originally in japanese but dubbed in english and also includes the option for subtitles"
4,A good read,"T.W. Doane delivers with finesee, discussing Christianity and its relation and similarities with the stories from Krishna (Hinduism), Budhha (Buddhism), etc. A must read for every sincere seeker of Truth!"
4,Great book,"I am taking this course from the text's author with BYU Independent Study, and this is the main text we are using. Dr. Kearl has written a surprisingly readable (with concentration) economics textboook. He backs up everything he writes with examples, and the book is organized in an interesting format: the first part of the book talks about mostly microeconomics and laissez-faire government policies, and the second part advocates governmental intervention in markets to prevent market problems.A note of warning: this is NOT LIGHT READING. You have to be serious about studying economics. There are no pictures of dead economists; in fact, there are no pictures at all because this book is in black-and-white. However, there are lots of graphs, tables, and charts, which Dr. Kearl uses to explain economic principles.Again: this is NOT a fluff textbook, but a good one."
5,AMAZING book,"I know this may seem cheesy but I can honestly say that this book has changed many aspects of my life. It has changed the way I view public policy. It has changed the way I decide who to vote for. It has changed the way I handle business ventures. It has changed the way I view of government programs. Etc and so forth. I had the honor of taking a class from Professor Kearl at BYU and must say that the biggest travesty is that he has never created a video lecture series like other professors at that university. This man is brilliant and truly understands everything that he preaches both in his book and in his lectures. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand basic economics, but like the other poster stated, ""It's not light reading."""
1,Typographical errors galore,"The sheer number of typographical and grammatical errors in this published book is astonishing. ""New"" instead of ""knew"", ""scent"" instead of ""sent"", ""to"" instead of ""too"", and the best error yet, ""cooberate"" instead of ""corroborate"".Unsatisfactory.Why this book was not sent to an editor is a question left unanswered. I would like the author to forward the corrected copy one day.Good luck"
5,Mix it up,"This is not the old Carman. He throws a couple of harder songs into the mix with his praise songs. Even if you aren't into his louder, harder, and faster songs you will still enjoy this album. There are fewer songs on this album compared to some of his others. Don't let that discourage you. Most of the songs on this album are a little longer so you aren't getting shorted out of any music. Check out some of the promos that came out around the same time as this CD. There was a devotional and a book for kids. Overall this is a wonderful album from a great artist."
5,One of the best albums in Contemporary Christian Music!!!,"I personally am a huge Carman fan. I have heard many of his albums and this one is one of the best that I have ever heard. It has the most variety. I consider RIOT an album for everyone because of the musical variety. You get rap, country, story, and power ballad all on one album."
5,Greek spirit,"I am sure that native Greeks will love this CD as they know very well who Ploutarhos is. For the ones who want to feel the Greek spirit and partly the life in the Balkans, this is the music they have to listen to.Some people might say that Ploutarhos makes them feel blue, but these songs are not about that. Its about 'joie de vivre', love, deep feelings, passion, passion, passion. It is the kind of music you can listen to while driving, as well in a bouzoukia or while you are having a romantic dinner.Despite the fact that the price is a bit high, I recommend you to buy this CD and Im sure you will enjoy a lot this sample of 'eliniki mousiki'."
1,2 episodes per disc...I'll pass,"Mutant X Vol. 1 is an all too typical ADV job--a few episodes per disc with an exorbitant price tag (compared to other titles). Andromeda and Farscape at least have 3-4 episodes per set, not great by any means but far better than 2! And besides the cost, think of the clutter that the entire season will entail in terms of shelf space.ADV will only change their format and offer their licensed series by season sets instead of a couple of episodes if consumers respond. I know that I will. There are lots of good alternatives--Buffy, Angel, Hercules, X-Files, Xena, La Femma Nikita, Star Trek, etc.--all available here at Amazon in season sets."
1,Drink coasters for sale....CHEAP,"I read one review that says it gets better in season two. I couldn't make myself watch all of Episode 2. The ""posing"" is unwatchable, the script unlistenable(is that a word?), I could go on but I will not. The posing is really bad, the acting even worse. I know, it's the script and direction, but did they need a job THAT bad."
3,May be to hard for some,"This game is by far one of the most difficult games I have played since stuntman for ps2.If you like trying to get through a level about a thousand times then you might like this one.There is nothing really special about this game except the cover system, weak graphics and extreme difficulty prevent this one from being a five star game."
1,Worst game ever,This is by far the worst game I have subjected myself to. There is no main plot to the game. I want the time I spent playing this game back. The game was just terrible
3,Old stuff...quite good for that time!,"Well, these are old Sonic Youth releases.THe videos are poor in quality, but the songs are pretty Sonic.Videos are also so funny, you can't really piss on them . 3stars OK?"
5,my body is a pastime my mind is an open sore........,wonderful angry noisy bohemic scary frightening amusing unadulterated cosmic flowing entertaining nihilistic avant garde stoic anti capitalist uncompromising funny impressive undeletable repeatable repeatable repeatable repeatable repeatable repeatable......................worth it for the video and live silver rocket and the early vid for my friend goo
5,Murs....The 10th Edition!!,"I have been waiting for this album for months. What it lacks in quantity, it more than makes up for in quality. Teaming again with the 9th Wonder to put out another solid effort from this West Coast rep. I have always liked Murs' style...consisting of a lot of humor with a little consciousness thrown in hear and there. If you want another treat to add to the collection, pick up the 2nd Felt album with Slug from Atmosphere and hear some of Murs' other work at it's finest. My standout track(musically and lyrically) would have to be ""Silly Girl"". The infectious chorus is really a nice touch ""ha...ha...ha....silly"" with Murs spitting rhymes about how girls didn't want him then but want him now. Pick up this gem from one of West Coast's finest."
4,The Rockwell of Hip Hop,"Murs is perhaps one of the most innovative emcees on the westcoast today. Murs' words are so well put together that he gives the listener a visual of everything he puts on wax. His style is very distinctive and unique. After the release of every album you can tell that he is improving as an emcee, which is why people continue to buy his albums. 'Murray's Revenge' and '3:16' were by far the best albums he has ever dropped in his career. Overall, I thought that '3:16' was a better album, but the two are fairly close. He maintains his consistency in production and his lyrics are well-improved. I feel that Murs will find more success as a solo-artist as opposed to working with the Living Legends (no diss). I have nothing but good things to say about this cat because I know that it's only the beginning of his career."
4,"Great CD, but way to short","I thought this CD was great. I have been following Murs and the rest of the Justus League (large MC coalition stressing real lyrics and quality hip hop of which Little Brother and Jean Grae) for the past couple of years and I am so glad I'm finally able to buy some of their albums in stores. All the songs are good in my opinion some of the best tracks I've heard in a while (great production and lyrical content) are Silly Girl, Yesterday Today, Love & Appreciate, and D.S.W.G. However, like all CDs coming out recently it is lacking in track numbers and length. I remember when CDs used to have at least 16 songs, not including skits, but ahh well, times they are a-changin'. But this is a great CD besides"
3,oh weeeeeeeeell,"Not as good as it could/should be.i don't even have to say it no more cuz other reviews alreadystated what i wated to say.it's a good album, but a huge disappointment compared toMurs 3:16 9th edition."
3,Wasn't feeling it....3.5,"Im a fan of Murs, and the Liv.Leg. Crew, but i ended up just skipping tracks until the album ended, nothing bad about the guy, Murs is off the chain, but i felt like i wasted 10 yucks, for instance the song about white girls acting black, i just couldnt listen....peace to you.."
5,Murs is real as they get!,"Hip-Hop/Rap today has been ruined by morons like Lil' Wayne, T-Pain, and so on and so forth. Murs keeps it real. Thanks God for real Hip-Hop/Rap, like Murs!"
2,Not that good.,"Murs just isn't a good as he thinks he is, at least not on this album, or his last one. At one point on the album he says ""...that's why 3:16 was genius"". Sorry, but 3:16 was mediocre. Murs sounds better when he's rhyming over Ant's beats alongside Slug. 9th Wonder's production comes off as amateurish when compared to the stuff on the Felt albums. Murs should drop 9th Wonder and get somebody else to produce his albums for him. Get RJD2 or something."
2,This is a good book for people who like long books,"This book was a good book it had everything you would want. It has romance, mysterious , and it was different it wasn't the same old book about fun and crazyness it dealed with a real life situation. And it could happen. The ending was a big surprize to me and it will be to you if you read this book. But if you are the type that don't ussualy read 300 pg. books it might get a little boaring for you."
5,The Next Best Thing To Being At The Concert!,"Bill Gaither knows how to put a concert together, and this one was taped in his home state of Indiana. Live albumns sometimes suffer from the difficulty of conveying on tape what was happening at the moment, but this ""Live"" release will not disappoint you! The special guests, Candy Hemphill Christmas, Jessy Dixon, Amy Lambert, and others all work together to make this a 1st class blessing!"
5,"Vocal Band fans, this one is for you!!!",I've heard both the CD and video. This is the best blend of homecoming favorites with lots of songs featuring the Gaither Vocal Band. This album is money well spent.
3,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this cd as a ""NEW"" item, but when I received it was missing its plastic cover, the security seal is broken and parts of it missing, and it had a sticker that reads ""AM630 KCIS"" which is a radio station in the state of Washington. So I do NOT think it is new, it is not scratched and plays fine so I kept it. But in the future I will be more selective where my order comes from."
5,excellent - great common-sense guide to fitness,"This is an excellent book which covers fitness and nutrition. I admit I haven't started the diet yet, but I like how it is set up - it's simple enough that you can substitute something if you'd like. I use it as a guide rather than follow it to the tee.What I *really* like about this book is the great information on keeping fit - here you get the *facts* on aerobic exercise, toning, such as how much to do, how hard you should work (you'll be surprised in the 'It Takes Heart to Burn Fat' chapter!), etc. She also has a chapter called 'Ask Denise' which clears up a lot of myths about fitness and nutrition.This is a great reference, with a wide variety of exercises. It's perfect for someone just starting out on the road to fitness, but doesn't know where to start - start HERE. With this book you'll get the RIGHT information and a completely do-able plan.Her other book, 'Shrink Your Female Fat Zones' is excellent as well. I highly recommend both!"
4,Great Book for Beginners,"I thought this book was great! Delicious recipes that were fast and an easy way to get into a physical routine. This is for beginners though. For those of us who have been working out for sometime, the cardio-section will not offer you what you are looking for, even though you will learn where you should be working out in regards to heart-rate. However, the toning is great for all (Denise only uses 5 lbs. anyway!) and I really like the Minimum Daily Requirement. It usually motivated me to continue into my workout. She also allows a day of rest; something that I really enjoyed as well! Once through the book a couple of times, you may want to get her ""Last 10 Pounds"" like I'm doing. Good luck and remember ""You are worth it!!"""
1,What a Disappointment!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I have enjoyed Ms. Mason's other books but I hate that I bought this one. It had the makings of a good story with the rich educated Mallory and the blue collar worker Ellis. Mason seemed to have rushed through this book and did not explore the characters. The ending was so far fetched that I had to laugh. The part about Mallory renting a court room with a judge and pleading guilty to her ""crimes"" was a big joke. I expected better from this author. I hope the other Heart stories are not this bad. After reading this book I wanted my money back. Romance readers want to read good stories with good characters and interesting plots. A happy ending does not necessarily make a good story."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZ!,"Having read all of Ms. Mason's books, I felt that surely this one would be the same caliber and quality as the rest; wrong! The story line was cliche and stale. Mason is known for her steamy love scenes and even those were ice cold. I hope that the writer is not falling to the same demise as so many other romance writers and becoming a mill turning out books to meet some contractual obligation. I hope the next one is better"
1,Borrrriinngg!,"What a mess! This was laughable. I really had to force myself to finish this one. My husband even noticed my dislike of the story because I repeatedly uttered phrases like, ""Aw, c'mon -- this is silly"" and ""Oh, lordy, how weak"", et al. I've read everything by Ms. Mason and she is one of my favorites. As a matter of fact, I was eagerly anticipating reading Mallory's story. What a disappointment. It makes me wonder if Ms. Mason had some sort of obligation to spit this book out in a hurry or something. And the courtroom scene at the end -- HATED IT! I really did laugh out loud. How ridiculous a story this was. I will probably continue to support Ms. Mason's work, but I'll definitely be a bit wary. She's going to have to win me over again. This book was so bad, it hurt my feelings; and to think that Ms. Mason thought she could get away with this...unh-uh!"
1,This is garbage!,"Mallory's story is no where as good as Foolish Heart. First of all Mallory was very spoiled, self-centered and manipulative. Ellis Carson gives the image of the strong Black man who knows exactly what he wants. Both of the characters were to strong minded, which leads to disaster and not love.Ms. Mason seemed rushed to write this book, she should have asked for more time to truly complete it. It had the making of a great love story, it fizzed instead of exploding. I wished we could have seen Mallory simmer down a bit, and get over being upset or obsessed with trying to out do Cole(her cousin). Ms. Mason focuses to much on anamosity and not the basic lines for the true love story, although I she is good at writing. This is just not one of her better books."
3,songs are o.k. but video scenes are very repetetive,"Great way for budding readers to learn how to speed read. It was fun seeing my 6 year old sing songs of before-years. Really funny and he's very determined to ""sing"" clearly since he's being scored.It would be much better if this manufacturer had organized songs into children's songs, 30's songs, 70's songs, broadway, etc... so it's not so difficult for folks like me to choose from the long list of songs.There were only 30-40 photos used as scenery and that gets quite old especially when photos are just random and have no connection to the songs.It's fun anyway. I'm hearing my husband and son laughing to it right now."
3,Pleasurable yet expensive,"The leadsinger is an enjoyable electronic system that will provide you with interesting memories, but I have noticed that there have been songs that you sing well and the karaoke machine acts like you haven't been singing at all. Meaning, if you sing wonderfully on a certain song, the machine might give you a zero rating and show the words, ""try singing."" The additional cartridges are extremely expensive for what you get, but to get a different variety of songs, you might want to buy an additional cartridge. Also, the songs' backround music is electronicized, meaning it doesn't sound like it is in real life. I would prefer buying individual songs so I could get the songs that I wanted instead of some that I have never heard of or don't particularly care for. Some of the lyrics and tempo are off, but it is an interesting and entertaining activity to do with friends and family."
4,Will Radically Change the Way You Eat!,"Peskin takes the conventional ""healthy"" high-carbohydrate diet and blows it out of the water. Largely because of its effect on the hormones insulin and glucagon, he convincingly demonstrates how eating too much of this macronutrient has contributed significantly to America's epidemic of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.The author stresses a diet with plenty of high quality protein, essential fatty acids (EFA's), and low in carbohydrates - especially processed.Peskin's arguments are based on, and well supported with a myriad of references and footnotes to scientific documents. My one big criticism of the book is that he tries much too hard to trademark the science, and repeatedly peddles his own brand of supplements, which gives the book an ""infomercial"" feel to it.Still, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about eating healthy and willing to set popular opinion aside."
1,Not effective,"A very appealing and compelling presentation, but it was not effective for me, so I cannot give this more than a one star.............."
5,"""Laredo"" by Steve Wariner","Great cd, hard to find. it was in great shape when i recieved it and it was handled with great service."
2,Not useful with Macs,"This seemed really cool, but I had a terrible time getting it to work on my IMac. I'm sure I could get use to the placements of the rearranged keyboard, but It does not get hooked up and used. Just more clutter to store."
4,Nice Keypad,"Great key pad.It took me several days to be use to it, but now I rock in Call of duty , and Combat arms.Make sure you have enough room on your desk . Mouse, kfull keyboard and keypad , not always fit on a computer desk"
3,Decent build quality but suspect ergonomics,"Unless you need the quantity of buttons, I recommend using a Nostromo N52 from Belkin. Cheaper, built like a tank and far more ergonically usable. Combine the Notromo with a god gaming mouse and a lighted gaming keyboard such as the Saitek REGULAR keyboard or the Logitech, and you have a great set-up. I don't see this keyboard as very usable."
3,Insights But Some Quality Issues,"As a professional in a technical field with an advanced degree and over 15 years experience, I purchased several books to help me in getting my first few books published. This book is straightforward and offers ""nuggets"" that are valuable, but several quality problems give me pause. In the ""Contents"" section, chapter 14 is completely missing. It indicates that the ""About the Author"" information is on page 332...although there are only 292 pages. In the ""Preface to the New Edition"" the author indicates that she's ""...added one complete exemplary proposal in this edition's appendix..."" but there ISN'T one!! Take the good, but put more quality into your own book."
4,Good book for the money,I purchased this book hoping for information for my book proposal. I was not disappointed. This book has valuable information and I am happy with my purchases.
2,UFO Bubble Launcer,"This product is difficult to work with because you have to hold it level to keep the bubbles from spilling out of the toy. Even with sufficient ""priming"" our family did not get the bubble fun we expected."
3,"It's ok, but not your best bet.","This game is ok. Can get kind of boring after a while. Not the greatest in racing though. I haven't played too many racing games for the GBA system so I can't really compare it that well, but I would have to say my favorite racing game of all is Top Gear 2 for the Super Nintendo.I like just basic racing, no additional shooting or objectives (like with GTA etc) other than winning the race, and Top Gear 2 lets you win money and build up your car with better parts which makes up for only having one car to play.This game has several different game modes (which you need to finish each for every level to reach the next and to unlock new cars). It is not very satisfying though, and you are left wanting something more. This game doesn't seem worth any more than $15 in my opinion... you would probably be better off buying one of the need for speed games instead..."
4,Average racing game,"This game has a lot of different options. A lot of cars, a couple of courses, and about 20 hrs of gameplay to beat the game... Not very challenging, but the graphics are a little bit better than you'd expect for a portable game..."
2,Special less,Spent too much time on character development to not have written other books in a series. Wasted time learning about players which left little time for the story itself.
3,early stuff,"Not a great book. His later stuff is more polished. His short stories are great,not a huge fan of his books. His keller novels are good though."
4,I liked it,This was the first of his books that I've read and I really enjoyed it. I will most definitely buy more of his books.
5,Great deal,"I was very pleased with the purchase. The book I bought is new, unwrinkled and I paid like for an used one. Perfect! The delivery was on schedule and I have no complains."
3,EH!,"I bought this based on the rave reviews, and while I won't go as far as to say I was disappointed, I will say it was something of a let-down. The 1st book starts out well enough, but slows to a crawl and is mired in too much technical drivel. Also keep in mind it is not a new book but a combining of 2 previously published books from some time ago. I struggled to get through it, I kept falling asleep."
3,Okay. But I really didn't get it.,"I really wanted to like this book. And, yes, it has a fascinating tale to tell. But there was something lacking in the writing that me entirely unable to 'get' what the writer was trying to say. It IS an interesting story about the origins of dyes, about the effect of dyes on other industries, the industrial surge of technology of the age, and so on. But I couldn't ever quite figure out what made the chemical composition about this particular mauve so unique and important, and what about it was pushing the world into the future. I'm not usually this lost when I read, so, officially, I'm blaming the author! Sorry Simon."
2,Pedestrian writing ; skip this,"I read half or more of this book but the pedestrian writing , and the lack of any flair in the writing or the subject matter finally made it impossible to continue . The author just didn't have a knack for focusing on personal, or historical, or quirky things that make or break this kind of book."
2,interesting but hard to read to the end,"The topic is very interesting but the writing is fuzzy, difficult to follow. I felt as if I was wading through a lot of jetsam to pick up here and there extremely interesting facts. I would trudge through a page or two and enjoy one paragraph."
4,"Diluted like dye, but a fun read","This title belongs in the class of Small Stories Puffed Into Smallish Books, along with ""How the Irish Saved Civilization"" and ""The Professor and the Madman."" All three are entertaining, but the effort to stretch New Yorker articles into publishable books wears a bit. Fortunately, Garfield's a good writer, so even if the book does indeed meander a bit the meanderings are worth reading."
3,"Jumpy and lacking in chemical ""substance""","I found this book often interesting and often confusing. People entered and exited frequently, and the insertion of some modern information about color broke the continuity of the author's message. I wished for more descriptions of the chemistry involved, what the various chemical reactions did, and how other chemists adapted Perkin's synthetic route to create new dyes. But the most descriptive information comes from Perkin's patent application, which sounds so general as to provide little useful information. So, this book gets three stars because it provided an easy summer read, but it lacked in scientific substance."
1,sent to old address never received it,I contacted amazon when I found out it was sent to my old address but they said they could not help me.I had to stop payment on it.
2,Not for High School,"Some previous reviewers have said that this book can be adapted for all grade levels. I must disagree. At least 90% of the ideas in the book are suitable only for elementary school use. It might be useful for the middle school level, but it definitely is not worth the money for a high school teacher."
3,Good place to start,"This book is good place to start if you want to get some ideas in making your classroom more fun. It has ideas from teachers that are tried and true. If you're a seasoned teacher, you will notice a lot of familiar ideas. This is a great book for the beginning or veteran teacher to revamp your classroom management. There's lots of ideas, practical ideas, and doable. The descriptions of the activities are concise and brief. It's a quick read. The activities can be quickly implemented."
4,Great book!,"I attended a conference where Dr. Sutton spoke and promoted this book a few years ago. I liked him and the book so well, I used to buy it for all of my student teachers! Dr. Sutton really knows his stuff! This year I am buying it for my daughter's classroom teacher for Christmas. I can understand where in some reviews, people do not feel this book was useful for high school aged students. I think that age group would consider some of the techniques corny. Otherwise, a useful book (parents could also employ the suggestions at home!)"
5,101 Ways to Make Your Classroom Special,Excellent book for a classroom teacher to motivate and encourage students to do their best. Good classroom management activities and techniques for noncompliant students.
4,Great Read!,"This book is a great read! After reading it I decided to offer it to the reading group at church. It was very moving, we all enjoyed reading it."
1,The Impossible Dream,"This CD does not contain all the same recordings from the original LP record album. Very dissapointed.There is nothing wrong with the music contained herein, but it did not meet my expectations."
3,A jones for Jack,"Jack Jones sits at the left hand of Frank Sintra and the right hand of God as perceived true believers of 1960's Pop sounds.1960's had bunches of TV time to fill, variety shows were king and male singers were knighted by performing on Ed Sullivan, etc. Jack Jones had an easy grin and a vocal that evoked Andy Williams, Steve Lawrence, Robert Goulet, and couldn't be winked at any ethnic group. Jack had a way to ingratiate himself. Importantly, Jack recorded mostly contempory songs and therefore stands as an icon of the early 1960's.This LP/CD was his biggest seller, has the angst of his not quite tru-believer version of ""Impossible Dream"" and moderne living Hi-Fi fun."
5,Classic Contemopoary Mood Of The 60's,"Jack sings clean and crisp. very good recording quality, considering in was recorded some 33 years ago. This album is a 'must have' for the Jack Jones fan.."
3,"Great book, but too long","I really enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing from page one, and ended with enough twists and turns to simulate the infamous ""deadspin"" itself. It's a well-informed legal drama, a riviting courtroom story, and even full of human interest.It's just about 100 pages too long.By the time the central case goes to trial, I'd lost patience, skimmed the trial itself, and then read the last 3 chapters. I wanted to like this book, but it just wouldn't quit!I've read books twice this size with no problem, but this story just couldn't hold my attention to the last page. If you have the time and the patience, give it a try. If you don't... well, I managed to understand it without reading the whole thing, maybe you can too."
4,Excellent Product - bad amazon service,"My dog loves this treat.However, Amazon carries close to expiry products and my 1st order & its replacement were both expired on arrival. I am still waiting for the credit to my account for the expired goods a year later! (something to do with multiple returns on the same order & their computer system can't handle it)The treat is supposed to be semi-soft & chewy not hard. If it is hard & tough, it's been stored improperly or has expired.I will continue buying this treat, but not from Amazon."
4,Book on Diversity,Good concept to open the discussion of diversity. Elephant/giraffe and sports analogy was helpful in getting people to talk about the issues.
1,"Your cakes will STICK to this pan, not ""non-stick"" as claimed","Company claims this item is ""non-stick"", but it definitely is NOT!! I purchased this type of angel food pan for my mother-in-law for Christmas and all 4 cakes she has made in it have stuck terribly. She did grease and flour well each time but to no avail."
2,Mad,"In the picture the cake pan definitely looks green, but the one I got was yellow (bright). It is very light weight, so I'm not sure how it will hold up over the years. I got it as a gift, so I have not baked with it. The description says ""the soft color"" and shows a green pan. But then again, it is called the 12 cup pan assorted colors. I had no option to select a color when purchasing it. I'm mad because the green was to match the person's kitchen that I bought it for. Haven't decided if i will return it or not. Wish there was free returns."
5,A Reader-friendly Guide,"Nicely written, with excellent illustrations, sidebars, charts, &c., this book will guide complete novices into a better understanding of where their favourite English version(s) came from. Technical subjects (for example, textual criticism) are handled simply, but not simpistically. Wengert most successfully realizes his goal--to ""enable those in the church to determine the validity of charges leveled against modern versions, as well as to instill an appreciation of the difficulties of producing new translations of the Bible"" (p. 17)."
5,Clarity makes this an excellent resource!,"I just finished this book, and found it to be accurate and highly readable. Wegner obviously did an excellent job researching for his treatise. The book builds systematically upon how we got the Scriptures. The sections on the different Bible versions are thorough and informative. I highly reccomend this book!"
4,Very good overall for the general Bible student,"If you are not a Theology graduate student, but you are deeply interested in the basic aspects of the origin, composition, transmission and translation of the Bible, then this is just the book for you. It does not go too deep technically, but just enough to stimulate further and deeper study of the Scripture. In the presentation of the difficult aspects regarding the above named biblical characteristics, this book does a very good job - especially because the text is fluid and easy to understand, and there is no sign of undue partiality from the author, just the natural enthusiasm of a true believer in the God-inspired nature of the Bible."
3,Pocket Flyers Paper Airplane Book,Excellant book for middle school students to learn how to make paper airplane designs.
3,Handbook of Metaphysics and Ontology,"Handbook of Metaphysics and Ontology by H. Burkhardt, Barry Smith vol.1 + vol. 2 Munich,Philadelphia,Vienna 1991"
5,DIGIMON RUMBLE ARENA 2 IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!1,THIS IS THE BEST DIGIMON GAME EVER CREATED THE GAMEPLAY IS GREAT HERE'S HOW I RATE ITFUN FACTOR:10/10(THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME)SOUND:9/10(GREAT SOUND EFFECTS)CONTROLS:9/10(THE CONTROLS ARE GREAT)GRAPHICS:10/10(ONE OF THE BEST GRAPHICS I EVER SEEN IN A GAME)OVERALL:9.5/10YOU GOT TO PLAY THIS GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-!!!-13
4,Good bit for the price,"The bits cut clean and create a very tight tongue and groove. So tight you may need to lightly sand the tong. This is good, its better to be to tight than too loose. Frued bits are a little sharper and cut a little cleaner, but also cost more. I agree with other reviews that it would be nice if it was wider than 3/4 inch since most wood is planed to a bit thicker than 3/4 inch and this leaves a thin strip on each edge. But the extra edge piece is easily trimmed after you cut the tongues just drop the router down in the table so the top of the cutter sticks up about 1/8 inch and make another pass on each side of the board."
2,Not well designed,"These bits are well made and cut as well as any. However, the design makes them very limited in application. The maximum cut is 3/4"". Most boards that are purchased already planed are slightly thicker than this. When these are used to cut a board that is exactly 3/4"", they will not render a clean cut. The surface will usually retain shavings. Consequently, to obtain good cuts, I need to plane down to .72""."
4,"strong, bold, crisp","This is nice tea. It's strong, bold, and crisp. I don't like sissy teas or coffees. They must be BOLD. I drink my teas straight - no milk, sugar, or lemon - so I have to like the tea itself, not additional flavoring. It isn't the best tea I've had, but it's much better than Lipton and similar weak/watery teas."
4,A beauty,"I've uploaded some of the pictures so you can see how the previous reviewer is wrong. The Majors while renamed to match Egyptiana, are wholly numbered so there is never a confusion.You can also go to this site and view the whole thing and see whether you like it or not. Beware the scans aren't the best and are not true to a deep vibrant colour. The only thing I do agree with is the lack of a solid lwb is really daunting here as you haven't a clue what's going unless you are familiar with Egypt myth and lore and I am not. Also the pips are relatively unadorned though tend to be Golden Dawn or Thoth based, still some of the layouts needs some explanation as to why.Nice deck beautifully done and well priced but some flaws stop it from being a winner."
1,Disappointed with the Celestial Angels Book,"I enjoy creating colorful mandalas and I thought this book would hold a variety of beautiful angels inside..........I was very disappointed......The designs were impossible to color with gel markers or felt tip fine point markers.........I started one page and after one hour, tore the page out and threw it in the trash.........I won't even attempt another page...........This was an expensive mistake........."
2,"Good time-killer, noticeable flaws","I was fairly interested in this book when I started reading it, and I will admit, some of the story kept me interested enough to continue reading it until the end. But the book was lacking depth in key areas and could have done with a more cohesive plot. Worse still was the ending, which not only ruined the plot as a whole, it also thudded into place in a graceless and poorly written clump. Definitely enjoyed the potential of this book much more than the book itself."
5,I liked it,"Don't agree with all the negative reviews- I found it a most enjoyable fantasy/ sci-fi trip. Intersting to re-visit Joram in his 40's, and an intriguing time-hopping plot, too. Nice coda to a great fantasy series!"
3,In response to the review by Brandon A.Downey,"Ok... Although i might agree about the review made by Brandon Downey about ""The Legacy of the Darksword""... I would like to object to the part where he said, ""For some macabre reason, they seem compelled to write sequels to these series, and so far, they seem to be batting a thousand when it comes to taking worlds we all love, then writing a single, rushed book to destroy everything we loved about said worlds. (*Cough* dragons of summer flame *cough*)."" For your information, Dragons of a Summer Flame is excellent... but you have to read The Second Generation first to understand the characters involved... Read the books in the right order! If you don't then your review is worthless....For all you people out there who have been reading the Darksword series, and want to read more W&H books... then start with Dragon Lance... (Chronicles followed by Legends, then the Second Generation, Dragons of a Summer Flame, and finally Dragons of a Fallen Sun...)"
2,Slightly entertaining but rather disapointing,Dont read this because it is never intertaining but just cheesebal
2,What could have been on the Darksword,"I am a huge fan of the original Darksword series. I was thrilled to see them revisit it. I reread the first three books with newfound admiration and absoulute enjoyment. I was afraid to read the Legacy of the Darksword because it would be hard pressed to keep up. It didn't. The alien race was never explained or even interesting without the slightest details of thier motives or who they are. Joram is nothing more than a minor charecter who has absoultely no depth. If you hadn't read the original series Joram had no identity. In some ways this is a pleasant, or not so pleasant visit with old friends but it leaves alot to be desired. The whole hopscotching through time really doesn't work and i finished by feeling cheated. I would still read this or any other Darksword sequals just on the chance that if can recreate that magic."
1,Curiosity killed the cat,"It pains me to realize how bad this book really is. I'm a fan of other Weis & Hickman works and I love the Darksword Trilogy. This afterthought of a book does the series a grave injustice, however. The characters are flat and the plot is insanely dumb. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Don't read this book if you cherish the Darksword Trilogy,"The novel by itself is fine. However, this book can't compare to the trilogy or the other books by the same author. Although I find the Darksword trilogy the gloomiest of all Weis & Tracy's novel I have read, they are a very good read and portray the human element (the emotion, the logic behind each action etc.) very well. This book lacks the depth and consistency. The plot is very very loose. I'm very disappointed with this book and don't think it deserve its place as the 'Legacy' of the DARKSWORD."
1,Great pictures horrible recipes,"This is a great cookbook if you like looking at great pictures of food and need some inspiration, but the recipes are horrible. If the recipes could at least be half as good as the pictures look, then this cookbook would be worth using. I tried out a few different recipes, and it makes me think that maybe they didn't try out the recipes before publishing this book."
5,Great cookbook,This cookbook has the most fantastic pictures of food. I saw it at an art class in Door County and had to have one. I need inspiration to make some different dishes for my family and company.
3,Ok for a tablecloth.,Tablecloth is OK. I thought it was a bit 'busy' with the pattern. The colors are nice though. But you cannot put this tablecloth in the DRYER. It says so on the label.
4,Totaly cool,"This game is absoulutly the best,the only thing is that when you begin to skate borad it turns blank for a sec. Which always gets annoying.You then have to wait for a ten secs for it to load.I highly recommend to all of those who love skateboarding. If you play for a long time it sonetimes gets a little bit boring who cares this game rocks."
4,Pretty Impressive...,"This is a pretty impressive cd, but not as I expected from the Godfather of Black Metal. The cd has more of a mainstream NWOBM sound to it that one of hard driving metal. Overall I am pleased with this cd, a must have for all Cronos fans."
4,Happy Birthday,"The product came on the day of my daughters birthday, which was perfect since it was part of her gift. It was in perfect condition. Thank you!"
4,Making Gaming Even More Interactive,Th Sony PS2 Headset is a very Sturdy Headset w/ a mute and Volume Function while I personally haven't found uses for it I know there are plenty of games I just haven't used it for. Like any headset it is going to take some getting used to when you first put it on. It is great for Games like the Socom Series or Online games with this headset you feel like you more onto the game. Overall for $20.00 it is well worth the price.
5,best for playing Need for Speed online,If you play need for speed online and you don't have a headset you need to get one weather you are new to the game or not in really helps
1,.::USB HEADSET::.,"Alright, this thing was crap. I play SOCOM II alot, and it really helped. It worked fine at first, but about 2 months later it stopped working. I can still hear, but I cant talk. I treated it very well, because I didn't want to have to go buy another one for $35. The cord is about 1 mm thick! If you bend it a couple times the wire inside breaks. I am very upset. I don't want to pay $35 every 2 months but I don't want to have to type everything. It's just away for sony to make a lot of money. If you figure, your headset breaks, you are most likely to get a new one. They make a lot of money that way. I am sure a lot of you agree with me when you say that the USB Headset sucks. If you have on and your headset hasn't broke yet, you just wait. It will very soon."
4,Sony Playstation 2 Headset,They work great on Konomi's Karaoke Revolution. I'm sure they would do fine with other games too. Great to have the hands free.
2,doesn't work wtih EA sports games,"I was trying to play ncaa 2004 and the head set doesn't work, with that. You must have the EA sports talk one. It works good with all other games. Target doesn't carry the EA sports talk head set."
3,Pretty Decent Headset,"I originally bought my Sony PS2 headset for SOCOM II, but ended up using it more for internet chats instead on my laptop. Volume control could be a little louder, but overall it's held up for over 2 years without any issues. Be nice if there were a wireless version."
2,up and down product,"alright here's the scoop.This Sony Playstation 2 USB Headset is fine for talking to friends on online games on PS2.However, this headset is not a durable headset. It is very flammy and its a cheap product. For the money i suppose the headset is alright.I do not like this headset very much.The cord is much too long and it gets tangled with my controller cord.With the SLIGHTEST hit on the headset something pops out.The Mic popped out while i was playing my ps2 online and the ear bud popped out and shreaded the wire inside."
4,Fun for a few games.,I just bought this for Socom 2 and James Bond: Everything or Nothing and I would have to say that it brings some life back to the games. It is a little uncomfortable. (The microphone keeps hitting me in the mouth.) but if you love to play online and you like talking to people definetly buy this thing.Too bad though Sony doesnt make a better product.
2,I warn you dont buy this microphone,I Bought this microphone for my karoke rev.I was convinced it would work fine.I wasnt happy about shelling out 30.00$ for a microphone but i did.For a day or two this microphone worked fine.It was always put away after use.It started to fall apart two days later.I had only used it once and already it was breaking apart.I also noticed when i first bought it that it's a bit small.I dont know many people with a head that small.Dont spend your money on this i warn you
5,Great for a 2 in 1,"Originally I had purchased this product to use on the ""American Idol"" game and when it arrived, not only did it work as advertised but I had an idea to plug it into my computer just to see if it would do anything, To my amazement it worked super as well with my PC, No software to install, it just recognized the product and worked!! At that point I truly felt I had stumbled upon a fabulous deal, and I really did. For the price this item cannot be beat as a dual purpose device. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,It does not work,I got the headset and I was so excited about it coming.I went to try it out but it did not work and I told my mom and afer that I hated the toy.
4,This thing sucks,It is the best piece of hardware that i have bought for PS2... the Title of my review was just to piss you off!!!
1,This Headset Sucks,"Got hooked on Socom I, and loved it. Same deal with Socom II. Now with Socom III, it's even better. Very similar to PC games like Counterstrike now. Unfortuanately I don't get to play as much as I'd like anymore, but when I do, it's easy to kill a few hours at a time. They did a great job with the new game, and I can't wait for future versions down the road!"
3,Works well but a bit flimsy,"It's reasonably comfortable and works well on a PS3, but the head band broke within about 3 weeks. The kids taped it up and continued to use it. It lasted for about 4 months, but now there seems to be a short in the wiring on both sides of the volume control. The wire is very thin. I think that the wire and/or the rubbery covering should be a little thicker and stronger."
2,headset,I have had three of the headsets they work great but after a month or so they all broke. I am now looking for a good one so I don't have to keep buying me one once a month.
5,MUST HAVE FOR ONLINE GAMERS,"The ps2 USB headset is amazing. I play madden 2005 online all the time, and the headset just makes everything SO much fun. You can meet new people and make new friends from all over the world, or you can choose a different route and just trash talk a lot which is just as fun too...it plugs straight into one of the two usb ports on the front of your ps2, and the wire is definitely the perfect length. Its long enough to be able to reach good distances, without having a huge mess full of wires all over the floor. You can mute your opponents so they can no longer hear you but you can hear them. All in all, the headset definitely gets the job done, and for just 30 bucks, its definitely worth it! highly recommended! (also look into the Wireless Controller from Logitech, its great...read my review)"
2,Good when it works....,I am about to purchase my third headset for playing Socom2. The first two have broken when suddenly it funtions sporadically and then finally dies. I am sure a wire comes loose in the ear piece. I have treated the headset carefully and have never dropped it/ pulled on the wires etc. They need to make a more durable headset for the money !!!When it does work for the first four or five months it is great. I wish there were more third party headsets so I would have more choices when my next one breaks !!! Lots of people playing online have also had this problem.
1,Same here...,"Like someone else here mentioned, this headset is fine WHEN IT WORKS! Mine broke after the first month! I also keep all my videogame hardware/software in great condition and can't understand how this occurred? I'm very disappointed in the craftmanship of this product and that I will have to replace it out of my own pocket."
4,Pretty good,"This headset is strictly for chatting. You cannot use it for anything else (like hear things in the game). The ear piece cover shows wear early, it's fragile, and the ear piece itself sometimes disconnects, but you can just put it back in. Not meant for people with big heads, the adjustable band has a short limit, and the mouthpiece will wind up in your mouth. The cord is long, which is good. Adjustable hearing volume, with button to turn off speaking if need be. Chatting quality is decent. Functions through USB only, not Bluetooth."
1,Poor durability,"Breaks too easily. I see many positive reviews. I cannot agree. It's 5 stars when it works, but when it doesn't-one star. I suspect poor quality control; some folks obviously have no trouble with this headset. Our's broke after only a few weeks. It was not abused. OTOH, the Logitech looks to be a worse deal. It has no volume control and if the game doesn't support volume control you end up putting the earpiece on the side of your head to prevent hearning loss."
3,Very Cheap,Yes i had fun with it for as long as it lasted the cheap thing broke after two months of play I am very frustrated
3,Too small for adults,"I have a normal sized adult head, but the mic boom is far too short for me. Apparently only intended for kids. I have to shout to control the game. Tried it with SOCOM and Ghost Recon."
3,Unexpected Edition,"I was looking for the edition of Fannie Farmer's with the recipe for ""Quick Paella"" but this one wasn't it. Anyway, it has many good recipes as do the other editions. If anyone knows the recipe I was seeking, it would be nice if you sent it to me via jack@golftales.net. Thanks!"
5,Receipt of Fannie FArmer cookbook,"Other than a tear in the paper cover, the book is in excellent condition and a wonderful gift to our daughter who has wanted one for years. Mine is held together with duck tape so a ""new"" 11th Edition in such ""good"" condition is a pleasure and will save my having to pass such a tattered one as mine on to the next generation."
3,basics only,I thought the book did not give a good guide to pricing or to condision. The book seemed to basic with not enough information to really be useful.Does not cover enough of the cars made and colors.This is just a quick look at some cars someone owns in my view. It is OK if you can not get anything else or can not afford a better book. The book is worth looking through for the fun of it. OK not great
4,Nothing,"This Album the same exact thing as nothing would normally be, accept with the bonus track UNANYTHING. All (most) of the art/title are written in Japanese, but obviously the music is not. The Correct track listing is STENGAH, RATIONAL GAZE (Awesome Song), PERPETUAL BLACK SECOND, CLOSED EYE VISUALS, (Awesome Song), GLINTS COLLIDE, ORGANIC SHADOWS, STRAWS PULLED AT RANDOM, SPASM, NEBULOUS, OBSIDIAN, and UNANYTHING."
4,What's everyone talking about?,"After listening to Chaosphere and then DEI everyday for the past two years, I really don't see that much of an initial difference in Nothing. Nothing is as superb as Chaosphere, if not more so. Sure, it's a little slower and more concentrated, but to me it sounds as good as DEI. The masterful syncopation is still in abundant evidence as is the Meshuggah style, ideas and overall feeling. I don't see why people were so taken aback by this album on first hearing. i think it kicks Chaosphere's...!"
2,not so great,"I recieved this album today in the hopes that Meshuggah would return to the power of DEI. I was pretty disappointed.While Meshuggah are technically competent, they lack theraw power and groove that they had on DEI. The songs on 'Nothing' are rich and complex, but seem too orchestrated.Trying too hard? Lost sight of the music because of the math?Who knows....Regardless... I have been disappointed yet again by the samegroup who astounded me with the release of Destroy, Erase, Improve."
5,MESHUGGAH RULE!!!!!,"I got into Meshuggah about 3 years ago. I own every Meshuggah album ever made. I love Destroy Erase Improve because it's a classic metal album for the ages. Chaosphere has an intensity that all other bands lack. But Nothing is the best Meshuggah album yet in my opinion. It has the most atmosphere and dynamic feel to it. I like to listen to the cd all the way through before I go to sleep through a walk man and head phones. It almost seems to take me to another dimension. I suggest buying the Meshuggah albums Destroy Erase Improve, Chaosphere, and Nothing. Take the time to really listen to each one and get to know it. It takes a little time to memorize each song but once you do you're in aahhh of this band. Long live Meshuggah!!!"
5,...REVOLUTION...,"I was like a kid coming out of the candy store when I purchased NOTHING... First thing I did was put it in my c.d. player and turn the volume up. I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL... This is a revolution and I can't thank these guys enough for what they have done for metal once again with this album. Nothing isn't better than Chaosphere as Chaosphere wasn't better than D.E.I. but they are all equally masterpieces and totally before their time. If you love Meshuggah don't hesitate to buy this album, if you don't know Meshuggah buy this album, hell if your an 80 year old great-grandmother buy this album.To all those who don't like this album I feel sorry for you..."
3,Is what it is i guess!,"This sounds like should have been the rest of the I ep. You can predict where the vocals are going to kick in. I was disappointed by this album, I know they like to do the ba-ba-daaa-ba, baaa-baaa-baaa thing, but man come on.Song 1: Baa baa daa baaaSong 2: Daa baa baa baaasong 3: Baaa daaa baaa daaayou get the point, instead of sounding like a mathy off time metal band like in songs like future breed machine, this sounds more like an off time nu metal album. I don't give it less than 3 stars cause it was my fault for buying it, should have known better."
2,crappy,"I bought this cd because everybody is always talking about how cool this band is. I disagree. Every song on this album sound the exact same, and I didn't like it the first time. I don't know about their later albums, but this one sucked big time."
2,what was tool thinking!?,"first off i'd just like to say this album ""nothing"" from my point of view i am a hardcore TOOL fan. I hear of this band they are touring with ""meshuggah"" I decided to check them out...thinking i'd be getting some kinda of slightly melodic yet metal band sound WRONG i got this stupid idiotic no philosophy death metal ... I'm pretty sure this album would impress a 2 year old who like repitive guitar chords off beat drum lines that my friends is the best part of the album right there the guitar and the drum lines even though they are not impressive but the lead singers voice is disgusting i mean is he meaning to sound that ... or did someone not tell him... i dont' know but this is my first buy into the band Meshuggah and i can promise you i will never buy anything else."
5,looking for this for a long time,I saw this on TV a few years ago and have been looking for it ever since. Just as good as I remember.
1,Bad quality,I'm glad I had a 2-pack. The first one broke instantly as though it was already fractured when I tried to use it. The second one held up very well and got the job done.
3,Nothing fancy,Nice set of extra racks for 1.99. I needed a filler and this worked out fine. The racks are kind of small. Each one holds about six good-sized cookies.
5,Eagerly Awaited!,"I have been awaiting ""Raivolution"" since the summer of 2005, and the album was well worth the wait! For what I know about traditional rai music, MC Rai's interpretations are subtle and refined in their amazing complexities of instruments, rhythms, and vocals, and every track has a foreground and background, almost like an aural photograph or illustration, that really depict both the history of this music as well as its future -- hence, its ""Raivolution!"" You can ""see"" the soundscapes and they rock!"
4,"Classical rhetoric was spoken, never written","I came to this book through my Classical Rhetoric class as an undergrad. As someone with a pre-existing background in formal logic and rhetorical reasoning, there was little that was new, but most of it was recast from the mathematical model to the oratorical model. This si the penultimate text on classical rhetoric, and the inclusion of the progymnasmata exercises is an interesting option for structuring class assignments. Sometimes the text is a little dense, but it is also authoritative and generally a good resource for an introduction to argumentative logic and classical rhetoric."
5,a clever political commentary piece,"16 Words"" is a clever political commentary piece in the vein of a 60s protest song. Guryan assembles 16 words from President Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address and sets it to music. The particular words she uses are to emphasize how are government (President Bush specifically) continues to lie to the American people. I was expecting one thing before I pressed play, and I was pleasantly surprised with the final product. Included on the disc is the track ""Yes I Am"" (a commentary about Nixon), a video for ""16 Words"" and notes by Guryan that explain why she put this all together."
2,"OK, just secondary material, and badly dated","This is a compilation of journalistic articles. While there are nuggets of info that are useful, it is way out of date and hence of little use. Witness the sub-title: the Japanese challenge!! That puts it in the way-too-old category as no one fears the Japanese will over-take the US as a technology powerhouse since at least 10 years ago!! Duh, it was written way before then and rarely rises above the level of Time Magazine depth.Not recommended anymore, but it might have been more useful - in 1988, when it was published."
1,Simple to consume but lacking in nutritional value.,"As noted by another review, this book reeks of rhetoric. Having read a number of excellent 'academic' articles by the authors, this book was a disappointment. Brown and Eisenhardt's previous insightful and thought provoking comments have been unnecessarily simplified and turned into academic junk food; simple to consume but lacking in nutritional value."
5,"Originality, insight, lively use of language and graphics.","This book posits an approach to reinventing and planning that overcomes passive reacting to change with a pro-active style. With originality and insight, the book shows how to employ concepts from complexity theory to the world of management practice. Each chapter illustrates a solution to a management issue.Readers will appreciate the lively use of language and good graphics that make the ideas that are presented both interesting and accessible. Reviewed by Gerry Stern, founder, Stern & Associates, author of Stern's Sourcefinder The Master Directory to HR and Business Management Information & Resources, Stern's CyberSpace SourceFinder, and the Compensation and Benefits SourceFinder."
1,All buzzwords and no substance,"Every Strategy in this book could be described by ""well you need to be in between two extremes"". Moderation wins."
5,Learn to 'speak' french,I like to learn languages but my specialization is engineering; other reviewers can offer more in-depth reviews on the linguistic front. But i must say that i am totally impressed with the bundled 'speakFrench' software that is basically a French text-to-speech program. The biggest difficulty that English speakers have is with the French pronunciation and this pretty much solves it. Combine is cautiously with a good translation software and you can learn French in a considerably smaller time. This is well worth the money. No wonder i would like to try a similar product with Italian and Spanish in the future.
4,"Oxford: Invented 5-UP, and 6-UP - and then stopped.","This dicitionary is a great idea, a wonderful resource, and a great aid in the study of French. It could have been made more user friendly and not so, ""qu'est que c'est?"" - err, ""crotchety."" Still and all, it is well worth the price and a splendid asset in working with the language."
4,Oxford Hachette French Dictionary,"When I ordered this dictionary I was assuming that it was a FRENCH dictionary, one in which EVERYTHING is in French. It is NOT. It is an English/French and French/English dictionary. I was tempted to return it, but I did discover that it is a very fine French/English dictionary, quite up to date and easily used. So I tossed my old one and kept this one."
2,Not what I expected,Was trying to purchase a true French dictionary. This is a French/English Dictionary. The cover is misleading. This is not what I was looking for.
5,"Excellent, combine with Pimsleur","The advantage of this is that it is handy, and takes very little space. Oxford-Hachette has a longstanding excellent reputation."
4,"Solid, easy to use","Overall the dictionary was fine. It was thorough enough to have many of the more esoteric theoretical terminology for translation. It is quite large and heavy, making it difficult to use at times. On the other hand it was limited in some of the jargon used by my particular scientific discipline, but then I know of any dictionary that does any better."
2,Informative yet lacking,"Although the book contained some good information I was very disappointed by its presentation. First of all it is only 32 pages long and the book looks like a copy of an original. The pictures were very unclear, it looks to be written in 16 point font and most of the pages only have 2 to 3 sentences with a picture. If you combined all the empty space it may condence to about 12 to 14 pages. To be honest it looked like she printed it from her computer at home...and made copies to be sold... I am a beginer and was expecting a lot more from a book claiming to be a handbook for beginers. I found Vision of Heal by Bernard Jenson to be much more helpful to a individual looking to practice this technique to enhace the heath of family and friends."
1,There is nothing in it!,"Having eagerly awaited my book on iridology by Donna Mason, I found there to be very little content, amature presentation and very limited information. I was staggered by the price of [money amount]for only 34 pages that are written in large type print with big line spacing. On average there are only 160 words on each page."
4,Awesome,This game is truly awesome. I got a chance to play the European version and I was just as hooked as I was to the original PC versions. It's along the lines of Tomb Raider with the movements and thinking that must be done to get to higher levels. I definitely recommend CS to true gamers who like to get really involved with a challenge. So parents don't buy it to teach your kids a geography lesson!
4,WOW 1996: A Yearly Blessing!,This is not the best WOW product yet it was a start of something that has become huge to me. The WOW cds has found songs and artists that I have comed to love. Disc 1 of this 2 cd set is ok and disc 2 is great. If this is your 1st WOW cd then you are on your way to buying more.
2,No offense but...,Sorry I have to say this WOW disk is a yawner. I would pass this one up and buy the others. I love WOW other than that.
1,Ow 1996,"As big a fan as I am of the Wow CD's, this one was probably the weak link of all of them because there was no variety in the styles of each song and they all sounded the same. However, I do like DC Talk ""I wish we'd all been ready."" All in all, the songs were just a little TOO mellow. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Pretty good,"The story for this game is about this dude who looks like he has a sock on his head who deticates his life to Frolf, or frog golfing. ""But what the heck is Frolf?!"" you might ask. Frolf is you hurl frogs into the air and get points.You must also get it into the hole. I would tell you more but I gotta go."
4,Looks Weird,Hey guys....this is the first time i have ever even seen or heard of this game. it looks like a little kid or even a baby's game....but then so did harvest moon and i bought that....its a cool game.... (...)
3,Who Mixed this CD ?,"There are some really great songs on this CD. Too bad the sound quality is so poor. I would recommend getting it, but be prepared for a lack of bass or treble definition. Whoever mixed this thing was either doing it for the first time or deaf."
4,Another very good album,Well the production in this album is not so good but the tracks are very good. If you like classic Motorhead you will probably like this album. Orgasmatron and Deaf forever are the top songs in this album.
3,Motorhead's steady decline,"Well this one was seen as the resurrection of Motorhead's career due to all the record company troubles and the founding members, apart from Lemmy, leaving... well they probably couldn't have done any better, or maybe they could have. Orgasmatron is an inconsistent album, even by Motorhead standards. The good songs are Claw, Deaf Forever, Built for Speed, Doctor Rock, and Orgasmatron (probably the greatest song Lemmy ever wrote). The rest are boring and sound alike. Things didn't get better for Motorhead after this release either... the songs started sounding too similar to each other and eventually led the band to obscurity. These days, I don't hear any mention of them except from maybe the wrestling fans (the theme music for the wrestler HHH and his group was done by Motorhead)."
3,"A decent , melancholic pop release","Ble appeared from nowhere in 1996 and managed to steal the show along with ( also newcomer ) Katerina Kirmizi . Their first offering remains their best yet six years after it's initial release . In a time where greek pop music lacked anything fresh and original , this dark and sensitive record came to shake things up a little bit . "" Enoches "" sold a suprisingly big number of copies in Greece while the first single "" Fovame "" became that years couples' song and was singed almost everywhere , from bars and clubs to parks and school plays."
1,a little long winded,"I have started reading the book and find it to long winded. If I want to read PMBOK I would read it, if the book is about Citrix please get to the point.Sometimes technical writers get paid by the word instead of getting to the point. I am at chapter 5 it is starting to scratch the surface, that is alot of reading for nothing.-Travis"
1,"Sorry, but I didn't like it at all","The announcement of this new book caused me a lot of excitement. However, I became very disappointed when I started to read it.Even though it has a lot of pages, it is not an in-deep guide. It talks a lot about general stuff. In my opinion it lacks some more advanced chapters and a most rigorous and strict approach.For instance, chapter 12 is about the ""server configuration"". The windows and UNIX stuff have got all mixed up. So, in my opinion, it is not good enough for Windows administrators nor for UNIX administrators. In the same chapter, when talking about how to create the IMA Data Store, it mentions only SQL Server (there are also Access, MSDE, Oracle and DB2!!!)I'm sorry to say that I would recommend, for instance, any book by Brian Madden rather than this one."
5,Peace & Strength,This cd is one I play over and over again to give me peace and strength during tough times or just to bask feeling God. It's like a warm hug. Cece Winans has a powerful voice and uses it to help many people and sing His praises. It's my favorite! Elizabeth
5,Good Album,"If you like the Gypsy Kings, this is a great guitar album with that type of music. Found this on Amazon, and it was a great album.........just very few vocals and lots of flamenco guitar."
3,"Good price, speedy shipping but wrong movie!","The picture of the movie posted for this item does not match the movie on the DVD.The movie title are the same, but the movie I intended to buy was the one based on the picture: ""Now & Forever"" (with Cheryl Ladd and Robert Coleby).Instead I received the movie that was described (with Air Suply and Christine Amor)."
2,disapointed,"I was really disapointed by the recipes... the pictures are great (only half the recipes have a picture tough), the layout too, but the recipes are bland... I specially resent the constant use of fondant to cover the cookies..."
3,Was Ok,I very much enjoyed the first book of this series. As the series went on I became less enthusiastic. I would encourage people to read The Magic Casement and then stop.
3,eh,"This cd can't even compare to Akron/Family's self-titled debut, but that's not to say it's horrible. Some of the songs have grown on me and if you're a fan of this band, I'd recommend trying it out. They become a lot more experimental and sound like they just recorded themselves jamming on this album."
4,good,"great, if short ep, more experimental than some of their other stuff, it does sound as if they just recorded themselves jamming, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. this ones my personal favorite, but not the best place to start with akron/family's music. some of the songs have harsh, feedback parts that might not sit well with some fans of this type of music, but again, i think it fits well.fans of more ""out there"" folk will enjoy this, others should buy their self titled full length. see them live, they will even let you tape their live shows."
2,They destroyed it...,"After a genius first album, Meek Warrior has ended up as a lot of hippie-babble... it may work if you are on psychedelic drugs, but this is just boring."
4,Of a different culture and era,"I'm sorry that some were not ready for this book. Perhaps I can help prepare future readers.If we are willing to read it closely and with an encyclopedia or the Internet at hand it will open us to cultures and an era long before we were born. Like life, this book is slow moving and lacks plot. The author expects her readers to have or acquire knowledge of history. Nowhere does she state the time period. To get that, one must Google the eruptions of Soufrière and Mount Pelée.The author's note at the back of the book should help. ""Many of the experiences of Janet Laidlaw are similar to my own; all the episodes in which children appear are true to life."" Imagine yourself with a passion to write, losing a father, and taken across the ocean to a strange school and you will start to appreciate the book."
1,Yawn...,"This is a boring, uninteresting, plotless book. I do not understand how someone could like a book that does not have a plot. I mean, you can't even tell what the book is about! If someone asked me, ""what is The Silver Pencil about?"" my best answer would probably be,""it's about a girl who does stuff"". This is modern art in book form. Do not waste your money like I did."
5,What's not to love about dairy farming?,"A concise, informative & amusing book that earned an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up from my preschoolers! From a teacher's perspective, the text reads easily and keeps the children's focus (no easy feat with a group of 5 year olds). From the child's perspective, the ice cream making activity was a huge hit (& easy enough for each child to do with minimal assistance), and being able to outwit your parents in dairy trivia (what is a flink?) is fun! I bought the book to support a science unit lesson plan & it was such a hit that we've ended up planning a field trip to a local dairy farm in the Spring. I'm very pleased with this excellent addition to my classroom library."
5,"Gloria - ""tu mereces la gloria""","This new album by Gloria Estefan is another showcase of her incomparable talent as an artist of this unique genre ""son cubano"" which she has elevated to yet another level. This album is another tribute to the essence of this genre and Latin music in general. One will always dare to compare and ask if Gloria can produce another stellar album like Mi Tierra, well I will say she has done it and the two albums should not be compared. This one continues where Gloria left off. It's filled with that singular mix of Latin rhythms that Gloria masters so well combined with nostalgic lyrics for her homeland, Cuba. I had no doubt that this production would be another top notch album, I just wondered which song would be the most outstanding. While the whole cd can be played non stop, I have to recognize #5- Caridad, #7- Besame, #11-Volvere, and #12- Esperando as exponents of tremendous Latin music. Cuba, Cuba.. algun dia seras libre. Felicitaciones Gloria."
4,Good Album,"Good album by Gloria. My favorite is No Llores which features Santana and Feliciano. The other songs are no as good. But overall, a good album."
4,From Miami to Havana-Cuba.,I was visiting Cuba and I wanted to introduce my relatives to Gloria Estefan. I also wanted them to know that she and a group of cuban musicians in USA are making good latin music.
5,90 millas - gloria estefan,"IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A CD LIKE THIS FROM HER SINCE, MI TIERRA CD. THAT IVE HAD FOR YEARS... AND THEN I BOUGHT THIS CD LAST YEAR AND I HAVENT STOPPED PLAYING THIS CD AND MI TIERRA CD.. ITS MAKES ME PROUD TO BE CUBAN."
3,"Mi Tierra - Alma caribena, que mas ?","well, she sings perfectly well, music behind is really serious, it grooves, the tunes sounds ok, but...it is just the remake of ""alma carribena"". this LP ""alma carribena"" was a logical following, and slightly different than ""mi tierra"", so it brought something new, interesting. This new one sounds ok, but it is just a remake (but anyway much better than unwrapped !)if it is the first time you hear Gloria in this context you love it.pero si te gusta gloria, lo compraras !"
1,Recorded in Spanish but it's not Cuban music,"I'm amazed at the number of people who have left comments that this rather soft, middle-of-the-road piece of American pop music is somehow Cuban music. Yes, it's sung in Spanish - and Ms. Estafan's family came from Cuba - but where's the meat? Which Cuban CD sounds anything like this stuff? Click on the soundfiles on this site for any Cuban musician's recordings and you'll see why.Having been a pop singer for many years, Gloria has suddenly discovered her Cuban family roots and her parents anti-Castro-ism. I guess it would be too cynical to say if you buy into the American dream, leave your homeland and become an American then there's a musical price to pay....and this rather tepid CD is a testament to that."
4,Cheech,"CD arrived promptly, but with defects. Vendor immediately addressed problem be sending a new CD."
5,Muy Bueno Gloria!,"While my spanish is limited - my adoration of Gloria is not, she makes you want to get up off your a** and dance with these great tunes! From start to finish she has put together an cd of great songs, great guest musicians, and while it's totally in Spanish - I don't care - it's great music and that is what counts....KUDOS to you Gloria and Company! Me gusta mucho y gracias!"
5,Chuck the Swiffer,"We have a dog that sheds like crazy, two kids, and a lifestyle that just seems to attract dirt. We used Swiffer products for a short time, but got tired of buying expensive refills and found this system. We use it all the time now. The floor cleaning solution works well, but the best part is the sturdy mop with removable microfiber pad. We use it to mop the kitchen and bathroom every night and it works very, very well--it gets the floor clean, then you either rinse it off or toss it in the wash. We've had ours for going on two years and haven't had to replace the pads yet. We bought this system for relatives and they liked it so much they bought another one for their other house."
3,No refresher included - trust Grace's review!,Please note that there really is no Bona refresher included but a 32 oz. of Bona polish. The vendor should correct the product info!! I will buy a bottle of refresher tomorrow to get the work started.
1,Not a wide size slipper.,"These seamed like a nice pair of slippers until I tried them on. I wear a 13d in every pair of shoes I own. Moccasins tend to run narrow so I ordered a wide sized pair. The slippers shipped to me were very narrow and my toes were crushed in the front half. If you have normal to wide feet, AVOID BUYING THESE."
1,Very Small,"These run very small. They are NOT a wide wideth. Additionally, the company has not contacted me with the requested return shopping label, so I am stuck with slippers that fit no one of average size!!!"
2,Not too comfortable,The lining was too thin to help with comfort and the leather was stiff and didn't allow flexibility.Not a very well made product. I have very sensitive feet and need comfort and support.
2,Hard Soles may Kill you,I returned these slippers as the soles offer less slip resistance than I felt safe. If you go out for a newspaper on a wet driveway and come inside to a low resistance wood or tile floor soles like these will put you down in a heartbeat. Rubber boat-shoe soles or pile-lined boat-shoes are a better idea... and not easily found.
2,Comfortable but not really a hard sole.,"Ordered these slippers as the description said they had a hard sole, they really don't. It is more of a soft gum shoe sole that provides no support and 'catches' on surfaces which can cause you to stumble. Wouldn't have purchased these had I known what to expect. Will be shopping for something closer to what I really need in the future."
4,Excellent fit and comfort,These slippers are very comfortable and keep your feet very warm. Very well made. I'm usually a 9.5 and I ordered a 10 and it fit perfectly so order up if your shoe size lands in half sizes. The only thing is the fur is abundant at first but quickly packs down accordingly with how your feet put pressure in areas. I'd expect this from any fur slipper but it happened within the first 2-3 wears. That's the only reason I'm only giving it 4 stars. Let me clarify that this has no effect on the comfort or warmth as these are excellent!
5,mens mocs,well constructed slipper and they seem to be true to size. my son has a narrow foot and these are a bit to wide for his foot but he wears them daily just the same. next time i will purchase narrow for him but it was not an option when i made my purchase.
5,Fast service,"I ordered these on 12.16 and they arrived Yesterday 12.18, I wish all vendors would ship there prodcuts to the speed and service this company does! the shoes are exactly what they look like in the picture........For a mens shoe they might we a little on the small/narrow side i were a woments 8.5 and i put these size 10 slippers on last night and they are a tiny bit long but fit perfect in the width......i seem to be able to wear any 8.5 shoe/heel on the planet. Just a little FYI, the true test will come on christmas when they are given as a gift.......Thank you for the awesome service shoebuy!"
2,"Comfy, but not durable ...","This shoe only lasted three months before it split open. I selected this model because the rubber sole curves upward and seemed firmly attached to the suede upper. However the connection is not secure and after only a few months, the rubber ripped apart at the seam and detached from the upper.Now my pinky toes stick out! Perhaps I am a bit rough with the shoes as I like to run around a bit while playing with my dog.Great shoe if you don't over do it. Not so good for active play."
4,Great for fall and winter!,"I bought these slipper pairs basically because my feet would be freezing when i wake up in the morning, and was looking for those perfect pair of slippers that could warm my feet up right away in the morning. I bought these and so far I am happy with the decision i made to buy these pairs. Only problem i would suggest is I chose my shoe size and these slippers are slightly big for my feet, but not too big, so I can still wear them comfortably. So just be aware when u chose ur size!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE !! QUALITY HAS CHANGED,Have purchased these same moccasin's from Minnetonka but this time BIG surprise...the top stitching is some kind of TWINE! Not the usual suede. Poor quality...unfortunately my husband wore them before telling me so cannot return..but will never purchase again! Khoels has better ones..will get them from there..sorry Minnetonka.
1,Slipper,I ordered the 10 double E wide shoe and the slippers I received had a sticker with EE on it but the actual slipper was standard width. With my wide feet I normally order a half size bigger anyway but there was no way my feet would fit in that shoe. So if you have wide feet forget about ordering these.
5,Worth the money,My husband loves these slippers and wears them every single night! Great purchase. He has had other slippers in the past and swears by these
5,Happy Hubby!,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my husband, who NEVER goes barefoot and in the winter constantly complains of cold feet. He is now in 7th Heaven. LOVES them!"
4,"Not at all ""pipe & slippers""","Great, warm & comfortable. And quite trendy. Only negative comment was that they were a bit small but thankfully beginning to stretch. However, might want to consider size up"
4,Shoes run small,"I bought a pair of these for my dad for Christmas and ordered a size 11. He has always worn a size 11 but these slippers run small! They stretch a little but I would order a size larger than you normally would. Other than the size issue, my dad said they are extremely soft, comfortable slippers. The hardsoles are nice for around the house or running outside quick. I would definitely reccomend these."
3,Forever ago.,"This is an old scent. I remember this when I was in college back in 1988 and a class mate had this on and I was transfixed on the beautiful smell coming from her. This is a crisp clean scent, I would put this in the green catagory of scents. I perfer the Eternity Summer to this but only because its sweeter and I tend to lean toward sweet scents. This however is a very pleasant scent but my nose has become overwhelmed with this scent for over twenty years now and can tolorate it no more. Its a pleasent scent but quite old in terms of scent life for a marketed perfume."
2,scense is not last,Consider to buy direct from store to get the fresh one. Quick shipping and lower price. It is not a good gift for your lover.
5,The scent that never gets old,"Was hard to find this and feel confident about the purchase based on the reviews. It's odd but that seems the same case with all the perfumes and colones. This smells great, just like the Wife knows and loves - and so do I :)"
5,Best Price Ever at Amazon.com,I purchased this Eternity for a good friend who loves Eternity the price is always very high so i checked Amazon.com and was able to get it for her and save a lot of money at the same time. :) Huge savings!
5,Light and Memorable!!,"I have used Eternity since I was a teenager (15 years of Eternity!!) and I have never received so many compliments. This perfume is nothing but light, airy, and elegant. No cheap perfume smell here. You will not blow poeple away with this, but you will definitely make an impression. My best friend, who happens to be a male, says that whenever he takes me out in his car, I leave my ""essence"" behind. He says this with a big smile. He says that the smell makes him feel like he's gotten a ""big hug""."
1,Calvin klein,"CK: not even close to original consistency, yellow staining, and scent is not lasting more than one hour, not happy with it."
4,Eternity---forever,My wife uses Eternity perfume and the on line price is better than the retail stores for the same product.
2,Not worth.,"I bought this with Lovely Sarah Jessica Parker which was cheaper than this , but much better.This is my first Calvin Klein and I was disappointed,fragrance is not good at all and it doesnot last for long."
3,Excelent,"I bought this perfum a long time but i couldn't fined it anywhere else so im glad that i founded here. The perfume arrived on time and in excelent condition, but it seems like the company changed smell and now it is too strong. It smells good but now it is too strong for me."
4,Like it,"This is an old scent.This is a crisp clean scent, I would put this in the green catagory of scents.This however is a very pleasant scent and its a pleasent scent but quite old in terms of scent life for a marketed perfume."
5,New favorite,"This is my wife's new favorite. Its very pleasant, neither light nor heavy, just right. It lasts all day and then some. we gave three of these away as gifts to family members and everyone loved it. Highly recommended. This is a great value too as this perfume is 72$ in stores."
5,Eternity for those who love it,"This is a very good parfum. Even knowing it depends on particular opinions, it's a very famous product.The box and the glass has good quality.I haven't much more to say."
3,Scent is rather ................ left to be determined,"In the first moments the product was great, however there is a strong yellow tint to this item. Also the scent does not seem to wear as long. Possible bad batch of perfume, However this will not stop me from ordering again at a later time."
2,"Mediocre, At Best",You will buy this CD because you are an anime fan and you voraciously consume anything Japanese. You won't buy it because mushmouthed lyrics and lame beats abound all over the tracks. You will want to return it after one track is good and the others are all lame R&B; ripoffs.Save your money and just get the individual tracks you want at a music subscription service. The days of having to endure 15 bad tracks to get the two good ones are over.
2,To Be or Not To Be,I like to buy these when I'm close my to free shipping target. I like these little bookmarks. They come in a variety of subjects. I think the Shakespeare illustrations were a little strange looking. Probably if I was a big fan of Shakespeare I wouldn't feel that way. I gave this particular set to a friend.
2,The are for children,I was disappointed. They remind me of the valentines children give each other in elementary school. Pull apart along the dotted line with picture book style designs/pictures. Definately not for adults.
4,Nice pizza flavor,"Love the pizza flavor, which I can never find in the grocery stores. Good quality snack without the fat and oily feel of chips."
5,Fun score! Great cast minus the star,"Buddy Hackett is the worse thing about this recording. Leave him out of the mix and you're left with three Broadway greats, La Mancha's own Richard Kiley, iron lunged Karen Morrow and the wonderfully sexy Luba Lisa. No the score isn't Broadway's best, much in the same league as flops like ""Bajour"", ""Golden Rainbow"" and ""Bravo Giovanni"" but it is still a fun listen. Except for Hackett's butchering of his songs (luckily there are few), there's the bluesy ""Can It Be Possible?"", Lisa's fetching ""Addie's At It Again"" and Morrow's belting of ""I've Got Everything I Want"" not to mention her expert handling of the title tune. Even lesser numbers like ""The Other Half of Me"", ""Fickle Finger of Fate"" and ""Almost We Made It"" will quickly grow on you. If you like the brassy sound of Broadway musicals from the sixties then treat yourself to this cast album."
3,I would give Karen Morrow six stars if I could.,"God love a belter! Karen Morrow's strong, clear voice is one that instantly makes my soul smile. Listening to her is like what I would imagine sunshine should sound like.All that being said, she's really the only reason to buy this score. A good reason... but the only reason."
5,"great mallet, twenty years on","I bought my first Wood-is-Good mallet more than twenty years ago. While separated from it in a distant place, I really missed it, so I bought another. The urethane head has exactly the right compliance, giving it the ability to transfer momentum to the chisel without too much shock. (If you have a degree in engineering, you will understand the value of damping... the really high frequencies in the impulse response are filtered out). For the rest of you non-engineer-geeks, you get a smooth transfer of ""power"" from the mallet to the chisel, and you won't beat the daylights out of your chisel handle.The feel and balance are perfect. Every woodworker should own one of these."
5,Great tool,"I bought this to replace a Marples Carver's mallet that got lost in the workshop remodel; the new one is a huge upgrade! Compared to the Marples, it's more dense and compact, and has much better balance and as far as I can tell, it's practically indestructible. I use it with my straight chisels for general woodworking as I find this style to be much more controllable than a traditional Joiner's mallet."
3,READ THIS FIRST!!! Then make your decision....,"FIRST OFF, I HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME YET.Second off, I rated this game based on what its average rating was in the first place, in order to keep from changing its status.THE ONLY REASON I AM WRITING THIS NOW IS SO YOU MAY REALIZE THAT THIS GAME IS RATED 'T' FOR TEEN.**NOT THE 'E' FOR EVERYONE THAT THE PRODUCTS PICTURE SHOWS.**I will write another review after I have had some time to play the game, and decide if it is appropriate for my 2 kids (8yrs, and 11yrs)."
5,I quote this game in my daily speech it's so hilarious.,"I must start by saying that Whiplash's humor may completely leave some people clueless. Think in the style of Space Ghost/ATHF/Sea Lab/Animaniacs/Spike & Mike stuff. Some of the jokes are incredibly random, but I love that stuff. Me and my buddies grab some food and take turns playing through the game looking for the next cutscene or humorous event. Gameplay is entertaining too, it really grabs the child in me that wants to create chaos by swinging an unbreakable bunny at everything. My buddies leave to work and school or wherever, and when they come back they're disappointed that I've played hours into the game without them. So I'm constantly playing the game over, or watching it again, and it's just as funny if not funnier the second time around. PEANUT BUTTER! lol"
3,kinda junky,"featuring very few enemies, you'll find yourself running to deactivate something most of the time. there are only around 40-50 enemies in the game, and compare that to ratchet and clank's 100s"
5,Best game ever!,"The only complaint I have about this game is the glitches. But being stubborn, I went back and saved alot, keeping a few files. If you do that, you shouldn't have any problems. It's non-stop comedy w/ Redmond the sarcastic bunny - in gameplay and during the cutscenes. The more you break, the more the damage amount goes up, so break EVERYTHING! A great message for everyone to knock out those nasty animal-testing humans. Save alligators, eels, monkeys, skunks, a chihuahua, hamsters, it never ends. Beat up security guards and scientists and stomp on them! This company needs to do a follow up -(doesn't even have to be same characters!). This is a must buy. I'd buy everyone a copy if I could!"
5,Big. The new look for college and high school kids,"The backpack holds my 15.4"" widescreen HP laptop with plenty of room to spare. It has two huge compartments and several smaller ones. The straps are very comfortable. The only drawback is that it is really, really big, which could be a benefit if you need to pack a week's worth of clothes in addition to your books and laptop. Having been a teacher, I have seen the size of ""academic"" backpacks grow over the last 20 years - even kindergarten kids now need the kind with wheels! This one would fit in on any college campus."
4,"Used every day for 4 years, Zero rips","This backpack is tough, really tough, and it holds a lot of stuff.I've used this backpack every day for the past 4 years, and its still going strong.I'm even considering buying two more just in case they ever stop producing this awesome bag. (Hey it happened to FireFly)(This backpack accommodates my Thinkpad T500 15.4"" with the larger 9 cell battery)Update:I bought a backup, and the design of the bag has changed since I first purchased it:The best part of the bag, the outside bottom, was leather. It is just nylon now. :(The inner pocket zipper is gone. (the main compartment) They replaced it with a lower mesh pocket without the zipper. :(There was a small pocket for papers in the laptop area. They removed it altogether :(I'm downgrading my review due to these money saving changes that compromised a great product.I wish I had the option to buy the older, better version."
4,SMALLER than the Maxxum RED!,"Please note that the Maxxum Swiss Gear Blue is actually different form the Red version. I purchased a blue one to replace the red one, only to find that the computer pocket is designed to be tighter so that the blue one does not fit my 16'' laptop. The red version, with the link below, will fit the 16''. Otherwise the products are identical.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007QCT0G/"
5,"Very spacious, very good looking, cheap.","This is a good notebook backpack, it's no so expensive and it comes with the Swiss Army seal and proof of good products, I recommend it."
4,Great Backpack,"Awesome backpack. I bought the older version of this backpack before college and that lasted 5 years with heavy use. This one has done great for the last 2 years so far. the only part that has shown some damage is the bottle holders, but that may be due to using a larger coffee thermos than probably meant for the holder."
5,Excellent laptop bag!,"This bag is great and fits soooooo many things.I have a lenovo t500, a 15.4 in laptop, and fits the bag nicely. I'm not sure why people are complaining that it doesn't fit tight but works well.The chest strap, as other people have mentioned, does get a little annoying but not enough for me to cut it off.There are pockets with in pockets and hidden compartments all over the bag. If you're a college student, this bag should easily fit a 30 rack and all your 420 paraphernalia, for when you're not studying hard.Definitely recommended."
5,great product,"just the perfect size - expands to fit lots of books and a laptop, but not too big as to break my backnifty compartmentsgood quality"
4,Backpack,"Backpack is very good quality, has great storage space and is very comfortable. The zipper seems to have 'bent' and, while it works, it catches at that point and has to be 'forced' to open or close."
4,Great Backpack,"Is a great Backpack with a lot of space for all kind of things, and it have been made of good materials... totally placed with this purchase, if you are looking for non elegant but comfortable backpack this is the one you need."
4,Love the Maxxum Swiss Gear Laptop Backpack!!,This bag is great!! Lots of storage room. I keep finding new compartments. It even has a perfect spot for an air card. I only wish I found one for a 17 inch laptop because I would like to upgrade my older 15 inch model.
4,Swiss Gear Notebook Backpack,"Good: Solid construction, plenty of pockets for accessories. Worked great as a carry on with room for a change of clothes.Bad: Chest strap located too high for me. Not repositionable. Needs to be."
2,"Great Backpack, but much too bulky and heavy","I agree with all the pros for this bag in the previous comments. This is an awesome bag, but it is too heavy and bulky. Even when this bag is completely empty, it probably weighs about 6 lbs. I like this bag so much that despite its weight, I kept it for a semester of medical school-it holds everything. Unfortunately, I have to sell it because it is too heavy."
2,Too much heavy,"I have just received the item. To my surprise and disappointment, I found it too heavy to carry around comfortably with my laptop and books. I will return this and find another one."
2,"15.4""? Don't count on it.","My Thinkad t61 has a 15.4"" screen with maybe an inch, total, of plastic beyond the glass. Yet with the laptop in the provided spot for it, you can't zip this bag closed. Because I'm to lazy to return it, I just don't use the special pouch where the laptop is supposed to go."
2,Padding uncomfortable,I am returning this backpack because the padding on the back is uncomfortable against my back. Other than that problem this is a great backpack. Lots of pockets and very roomy.
1,A world of compartments,"First off all my pants just exploded, Now about the bag. when it arrived in the mail it seemed average. but when i realized new york could fit i lift new york and stuffed in my bag except my school. so i lifted and it was as light as a feather. i went in school and was at homeroom. my teacher asked for my signed report card so i jumped in my bag and went to the compartment my house was in. i talked to my mom and i grabbed my report card. i then jumped out. so at lunch i jumped into a compartment and ordered some pizza. then i jumped out. then eventually a man rose from the book bag and said delivery. my friends were so happy all of them had a heart attack. so i stuffed all in my book bag and told them to go into the left compartment for the hospital. when school was over everyone jumped in my bookbag to go home this is why i gave it a 1 star, everyone was to much so it exploded. oh yeah im in 5th grade and im 36"
5,Howard Zinn: An Eye Opener,"Howard Zinn is a wonderful and radical (double meanging) historian! I read his book, and it's absolutely amazing as well as an eye-opener. I would suggest that everyone read this wonderful book. He writes in such an eloquent and simple way. He's not one of those historians who lack a sense of humor or uses those million-dollar words to write about history. History is much more enjoyable and intriguing when written Howard Zinn. He's one of my favorite authors and I give a double 5!"
3,Get it from your library,"The authors bring to light some fine hikes, but their directions while on the trail can be ambiguous, bordering on the nonsensical. The trail guide writer's task is simple, but not easy: above all else, write with clarity. Bring an extra water bottle and be prepared to do some back tracking."
5,Health & Wealth,"Feitelberg does a phenomenal job correlating financial health to physical health. This is a read that goes quickly as the prospects of financial benefit become clearer page by page. I have been on the program 2 weeks and my personal understanding of my wealth and its potential 2 months, 2 years & 2 decades from now are finally tangible goals. The Net Worth Workout provides a coherent chronology of how to ""clean up your house"" and allows you to rest easier at night knowing what your financial future holds. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone wanting to know where they stand monetarily and looking to achieve their desired net worth in life."
5,Super Funny,Gavin and Stacey is funny. I can't wait for season two to come out here in the States! watch it and you will love it.
5,Great Welsh show,"okay okay i think its english, not welsh. but still, its a great look into the differences and animosities (and similarities) between England and Wales. the cast is FANTASTIC - the writing is even better (written by the 2 ""sidekicks"" Ruth Jones and James Corden). solid british comedy, a bit less dry and a bit more romantic than something like Pulling or Peep Show, but definitely not as ""rom com"" as Coupling. I watch this one over and over.And I had to write a review because the previous reviewer seemed to mis-rate based on their evaluation... it seemed like they should have given 4 stars for what they wrote, but only gave three. this is at least a 4 star show, as I think the comments of even that review reflect.enjoy!"
5,My favorite show,"My favorite show. Hopefully they will be releasing the other two seasons and the christmas special in the states. They do sell the other seasons on the UK Amazon, so you may be able to buy it that way. I was lucky to have my in-laws bring the others over when they visited. And, since it's a different region, I just watch it on my computer. I really hope they make another season as well. Until then, I'll just watch these episodes over and over!"
5,Fantastic show.,Character driven show with some of the best characters ever written for television. 'Nessa and Smithy could be the funniest most endearing characters ever.
2,Just OK.,"I was searching British TV and came across this series. I have watch three episodes. It's funny, but sometimes I don't get the British humor."
5,One of the best comedies ever !,"We already own the complete series,watched many times .This was a gift for our niece hoping she will enjoy it as much as we do"
5,Barlow Girl - Music book,The book worked very well. My wife and her sister sang one of their songs in church. The song and piano sounded great.
5,"i'm 13, but it's' easier to write on here! GO BARLOWGIRL! YOU ROCK MY SOXS!","BG is by far the best Christian Rock band I've heard! THeir harmonies are perfect, and thins music is very easy. I've already memorized a lot of piano parts and guitar parts, just because I love it. Please don't delay/hesitate to get anything BarlowGirl. I can't wait for their next CD! (And I know their producer, Otto Price, and he rocks too! Part of the credit to this album should go to him! GO OTTO! GO BG!) Thanks!"
2,this book,i have to admit that the pictures in this book are some of the most stunning i have ever seen off dubai. but unfortunatly the books narritive was poorly done. The writer is undescriptive and does not show dubai as a glorious city. its almost as if she was forced to write this book. such a dissapointment compared to the pictures!!!
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Lazarus Churchyard inhabits a very twisted world. He, and a few offsiders work as troubleshooters for hire, of a sort. They get involved with monsters, and magic, and the occult, because they are some of the people that can deal with that sort of thing. He, himself has the odd superhuman abilities that give him an advantage in this sort of work."
4,The grossest book I ever read!,Janey Johansen has an evil friend named Stacy LaPlante. They are competing to raise money for their squad. Boogaroni gets in the way. I would recommend this book to people who like gross stuff and mysteries. This book would be good for third through fifth graders.
1,Foggy plastic! Don't waste your time or money!,This 'windshield' is nothing more than foggy plastic. The seller also does not mention that this only fits Polaris Rangers 2008 or older (this is marked clearly on the box) so it did not fit my 2011 Polaris Ranger. Will be returning promptly.
5,QuadGear UTV Windshield,The windshield is great. It has turned an often uncomfortable ride into a more enjoyable one. It appears to be very sturdy so should last a long time. The price is a bonus. I have recommended it to others. Thanks KP
5,Can't beat the price!,"I purchased this along with a back window for my Arctic Cat Prowler. I already had the soft top. It keeps me dry and also blocks the wind. Well worth the price. Constructed well, should last for years as long as it isn't abused."
3,It looks ok but!,"The windshield fit really good so I thought this is going to be great. That was until I got inside a noticed that there is a lot of distortion when you look out the front window. I thought I could get over that until I started to drive my 2003 Polaris Ranger around. The windshield needs more tie down straps across the top and bottom. Even at low speeds it starts to bow in almost as soon as you start moving. By the time you get up to about 30-35 mph the windshield is touching your hands on the steering wheel. I only drove around our street a couple of min. as a test, but it might get even worse when it is warmer and the plastic can stretch even more. Save your money and get a hard front window. They may be a couple hundred dollars but they would work a lot better."
4,Religious music you can dance to,"I love Charlie Daniels and The Door is one of my favorite albums for dancing my prayers. So I ordered Steel Witness expecting the same. The music doesn't disappoint, although it is perhaps somewhat less compelling than that in The Door, being less coordinated. But I have some theological issues with three songs, since I come from a tradition which does not accept his Rapture theology. But that doesn't stop me from playing the album- I just rachet up my tamborines and dance along to the glory of God."
2,Disappointed,"There was no mistaking about this being Charlie Daniels. However, every song seemed to be at the same pace and tempo.It sounded like his bus was running outside and he was in a hurry to get going. Some Gospel Music just can't be sang in a fast tempo and still have the same message. I've collected and sung Gospel Music for 40yrs. I'm glad Charlie is singing a different tune these days .... but he needs to slow it down a bit."
3,watch,IT IS A BEAUTIFUL WATCH.HE LIKES IT.BUT I WASH IT CAME IN TWO WRIST SIZES.IT COST $15.00 TO MAKE IT SMALLER.ONLY 2 PIECES TAKEN OUT.
4,fabulous boots,"These boots were fabulous when I got them, but unfortunately they were very tight and I couldn't zip them up. I had to exchange them for something else. I wish I knew that they ran small or slim, otherwise I would have definitely kept them. They were hot!!!"
3,Nice but it smells like plastic,I love everything about this except the smell. The texture and consistency is nice but this smells like stinky plastic or something like that!
3,Item as described,"This item seems to be what was described. I haven't used the product yet, but it appears to be what I ordered... just in a different looking tube. The delivery time was reasonable. The price was good, but the shipping cost exceeded the price of the item so I wouldn't likely purchase this item again online. I can't complain about the seller. I mistakenly thought this item was covered under Amazon's ""super shipper savings"" heading. So, I don't blame the seller for the shipping cost, but was surprised when I saw that the price I paid was $5 more than I had anticipated. Not the ""deal"" I had expected. I could get a similar product at Walmart for less than I paid with the shipping included for this item."
2,"Deep, but boring","This game is fun if you're bored. You can go across the world, and play people in fake arcades. Before you play that, you're in for an extensive training mode, and even if you master it and beat all of the arcade mode.... no one you know will play with you.This game is okay, if you have 2 billion hours to learn how to rock it.Great game, if you have the time. If you wanna pick up and play with your friends, you might as well get some kind of Mario Party game, 'cause this is whack unless ya'll know what you're doing, which hinders the EFF out of this game.I would give this a 10 outta 10, but due to the learning curve, and lack of competition in real life, this is more like a 3/10."
4,why did I buy this?,"Well, its as the title says. VF4 EVO. IF you already have VF4(as I do) there is hardly any differance. They added a quest and 2 charaters. So, if you don't already have VF4, this is a good buy for you. Its not realy worth the extra $20, if you already have VF4."
3,Fun at first...annoying later!,"I liked this game at first, but as you get further the opponents become just impossible to beat. The opponents always do alot of guarding that you hardly land a hit. It's also difficult to get rewards. I mean, you do a lot of fighting, you smash your controller til you break it, then if you win you don't get enough to buy the ridiculously expensive items. This game has good graphics though. Fun only if you play against a friend, otherwise it's just torture. Don't spend more than $5 for this game!"
2,I thought this would be better than Virtua Fighter 4...,"I thought VF4: Evolution would be better than the normal VF4, but I was wrong. There's only better graphics, more arenas, and annoying guitar music along with a new mode. The game's addictive at first, but then I wondered why I was wasting my time on it because I ended up dragging myself through playing it. VF4: Evolution does not have a single bit of my recommendation."
3,Open style that is very enjoyable,"I was not familiar with Susan Ashton's work until I borrowed two of her albums from the library, A Distant Call and Angels of Mercy. I enjoyed the albums so much that I borrowed them a few more times and eventually bought them. Most albums get tiresome after listening to them a few times, but not these. I like her style."
4,landmark Susan Ashton,"In many ways, this is a landmark Ashton album. She ends her almost exclusive producing/songwriting collaboration with Wayne Kirkpatrick -- a partnership beyond magical that defined the Ashton sound. While Kirkpatrick produces four of her cuts here, she also partners with CCM giant Brown Bannister and veteran producer Michael Omartian. Songwriters also run the gamut from Michael W. Smith to Sheryl Crow. This album, straddling both country and adult contemporary pop, also wears that ""Christian lifestyle"" label in that not all the cuts are explicitly focused on God. New producers, new material, new musical directions -- this album does not disappoint. My favorite cuts: ""You Move Me"" and ""Lonely River"" -- both have hauntingly beautiful melodies and deeply insightful lyrics. A solid, confident release from one of the most precise, expressive voices in music today that will challenge and encourage your walk with God."
2,Too much like country,"I really like ""You move me,"" which is much more mainstream than the rest of the album. But the rest just wasn't my taste because I wasn't looking for country. I wound up giving it away to a friend of mine who likes country music. But hey, maybe you like country, then you might like this."
4,This is a fabulous album!,This album has almost every musical style imaginable. Susan Ashton does an incredible job interpreting each song. It truly has something for everyone. I can't think of one song that I don't like. Definitely worth buying!
4,Death of a quilter,"Genevieve Bayard returns to Alpine to have a reunion with the women of the Burl Creek Thimble Club, a quilters group to which she used to belong. The ladies seem to be having a good time until Gen dies at a dinner party with her friends. As always, newspaper editor Emma Lord decides to conduct her own investigation, in spite of being discoraged by her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Sheriff Milo Dodge. Her investigation reveals some long-hidden secrets, including a possible affair, and the stealing of quilt patterns. All of the evidence points to Gen's best friends and to Emma's friend, Vida. Emma redoubles her efforts to exonerate Vida and along the way she discovers some things she wish had stayed hidden. Mary Daheim can always be counted on to write a good mystery with interesting characters, a dash of romance and some laughs along the way."
5,A PLEASURE TO READ,"Ms. Daheim is certainly a wonderful story teller. This is the first of this series I have read and I was afraid that I would be stepping into the middle of a tale already partially told, as so often happens in ""series"" books. This work, while certainly related to others, and was obviously a sequel to other works, was easy to get into and the story line no worse the wear. It stood on its own. This is a low keyed mystery, or I should say, several mysteries, which were a pleasure to read. The story moved well and you certainly came to know and appreciate the key characters. The town of Alpine took on a life and personality of its own. There were plenty of twists and turns and it was not a work that I could figure out after the first two chapters. All in all, it was a pleasant read and I do highly recommend it."
3,Slow Going,"I haven't read any of the other books by Mary Daheim so I can only comment on this one, not the series as a whole. The plot moves very slowly and there are too many characters and names to remember. Everyone in the town seems a bit too quirky to be realistic. That goes for the names she's given them too; just unbelievable that so many people in town have oddball names. By the title of the book you would assume the story has a strong quilting motif but that is not the case. The 'quilting' aspect could be lifted out and replaced by almost any other activity without disturbing the plot.Still, it was interesting enough that I kept reading to the end without skipping ahead to find out who the murderer was and how it would all play out."
3,Glaring mistake in murder!,"I hope that Ms. Daheim consults a doctor before she writes another poisoning mystery. In The Alpine Quilt she has the victom die from glipizide, which she refers to as insulin, which all diabetics know it is not. A death from an overdose of glipizide would likely result in a coma over several hours, not minutes. It does a grave disservice to those of us who are diabetic. As a pill it has to be digested and enter the bloodstream before it can cause a lowered blood sugar. Other than that glaring mistake, this was an okay book, very typical Emma Lord series, but some of the dialogue & scenes seemed forced. I have enjoyed all her other books from both series so far & hope she gets back on track for the next Emma Lord installment."
1,Clove Basil,"I used the whole packet. The seeds are useless. Not a single seed germinated. Waste of my money. The other packet I purchased from the same company, Rama Tulsi, gave me two plants."
1,useless,followed all the instruction on packet did not grow even after taking care of it like baby.i do not know why people sell the stuff that does not work.
5,"Good for doctors, better for students",This book is a very good tool for students because they can learn directly from an evidence based book.
4,too easy but fun!,"After a long time of waiting, it was finally announced that Budokai was coming on GameCube! I ordered it in July, because it was supposed to come out on the 26th of August but then it was pushed all the way back to October! After I bought it, I beat it in one night. I didn't get every character and all that, but the story mode is way to EASY!!! That's the odd thing about the game, some parts, you just fly through and others, you're stuck on for the rest of your life! After you beat story mode once, you can go to it again and pick which level you want and you can be different people. When you go to the level select type thing, and pick the one where you get to be piccolo and fight nappa, is way too hard! In general, I'd give it a 4/5. It's a fun game, especially tournament, but it's too easy in some parts and too hard, I recommend it."
4,DBZ watchers only,"I bought this game for my 7 year old son, and i found myself soon playing Budokai like any other game we have. For starters, i am a pretty heavy gamer, just ask my wife, and i found this game good for only one reason. It is that my oldest son filled me in on plot and throughly explained things. I like the plot, but that is because i am wierd. From a gaming stand point, man the entire control of movement and speed of getting somewhere stinks. Horriable to actually say that this actually a good fighting game."
3,Dargon Ball Z,"This is actually a pretty fun game(surprise!). The graphics are just OK, but the game itself is pretty cool. You have an option of doing story mode or Vs. Battle. In story mode, obviously you go through a story. The Vs. mode kind of explains itself too. You start out with a number of characters, and as you progress through the game, you gain new abilities and new characters for Vs. mode. Using different combinations moves create other moves(different for different characters). Each character having a second outfit too. This is a pretty fun game. But I give it only three stars because there are several newer games in this series(lol)."
4,Pretty fun,"This game was pretty fun, but as all games do, it got old after a while of playtime. Still, while I was playing it, I got much enjoyment."
3,"OK, not too scientific","I was hoping for a more scientific book for researching health and faith. This is OK but goes pretty light on the science. A better book, I think, is called Sprituality, Theology and Psychology (maybe not in that order). It ties the three together nicely."
3,Solid Overview,"This is a solid overview chronicling the events during the Columbine shootings. I bought it to do a project at school with and it will give a good understanding of when things occurred. There could have been more done involving the kids who were victims and the shooters as well, but overall it is a good video."
3,Better than you're probably thinking,"Crappy heroes, a crappy idea---who would've thought that it turns out to be a half-decent book. A little too ""hip"" and ""trendy"" for my taste, but the campiness makes it fun. I hate Nightwing with a passion, but I actually found him tolerable.A suprising effort. Nothing great---but suprising."
3,Works but had to use my own screws...,"This product works for it's purpose, keeping a door from swinging open. I have a toddler and a busy street out the front door so I have this up high as a safety precaution. I wouldn't expect it to stop a burglar! The install was easy, every single screw head broke off. Luckily I had appropriate sized screws around the house so it wasn't a big issue, but be warned!"
2,Made in China,"I bought the antique brass version of this product. The appearance of it is nice, but two of the six included screws had their heads twist right off while I was installing it on my door. I drilled them out and replaced with some cheap wood screws- kind of ruins the antique brass look but at least this thing won't just fall off my door with normal use. Not the kind of quality I expected from a ""door guard""."
5,That what I was looking for,"I was looking for chain door guard,and this one was perfect: sturdy and nice, I like the color.so definitively recommend it!"
3,Pleasantly Cheesy Comedy,"I can only add a little to the other, very thorough review. Despite the great fight scene with Kurata and Chiba, someone looking for the Chiba of ""Streetfighter"" will be disappointed because this really is a different kind of movie.The English title makes it sound like a serious movie, but this is all comedy. The Japanese title, ""Master of Thunder"", is written in a cartoon font that makes the viewer immediately aware of it. The group that fights the demon are different stereotypes of modern Japan; an ""Otaku"" geek, an anime girl who works in Akihabara, an African (who is portrayed in a rather racist manner), and so on. An enjoyable tongue-in cheek-commentary on youth in Japan using traditional Japanese themes of cooperation,loyalty and friendship.Rating: 3.5/ 5 stars.Special features include stills, filmographies (severely truncated for Chiba and Kurata) and Biographies. The behind the scenes featurette is interesting enough, but not subtitled."
4,Is this ever going to come out on DVD?,"Release this on DVD PLEASE...Release this on DVD. Great movie, still remember it but who in the hell still uses VHS?"
4,"This is Elektra, and all I have on is my ears",Another rumination on the importance of and difficulties in communicating with the people who are closest to you. For which CB radio was the perfect medium in the 1970s. Paul Lemat is earnest to the point of being irritating. Candy Clark is pile of confusion and lust. You have to love them.
3,Citizens Band,"I recently came across this on Netflix instant seeing the Rig on the cover and information,then sadly to my disappointment,the ""Rig"" appears briefly, A White Western Star(Just like in the James Brolin Movie Steel Cowboy). And A Wrecker, You have Charles Napier(Trucking Shows Movin' On Tv Series and Bj & the Bear Tv Series,Trucker Movies.) and a Silly even for a Movie plot. If you are looking for CB Action it will not disappoint but Trucking isn't it and the movie to top it all off does not make sense and is boring and long.(reminds me of Smokey and The Hotwire Gang-another CB Type Movie and just as Boring).You have some parts where it seems they just want to make fun of Hillbillies and Of A Priest(A CB Priest)."
3,The only accurate movie of the CB craze of the 70's,"Although the characters of the movie are ""amplified"" somewhat, the movie gives a pretty good idea of how CB had taken hold of the average citizen in ""bubbaville"" USA. I found it nostalgic, and my only complaint is that all the radios used for the movie were supplied by Radio Shack (I was hoping to see some old favorites). END"
5,New Dog Collar,"May dog is 8 years old now (2011) and I bought the same collar when she was just 1 years old. I notice that hte old collar was coming apart and it was time for another one. I look up the maker of the collar on Amazon and found it. I hope my dog last as long as the new one does. Great product, great price and great seller."
1,Black neck,It's absolutely awesome that the manufacturer doesn't test thedye used in these collars on a dog in the rain. Maybe it doesn'train in China.
