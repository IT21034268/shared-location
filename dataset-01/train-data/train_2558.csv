1,Very disappointing after the excellent job Douglass did with Darkwitch Rising,"I found the abrupt shift in focus in this book awkward and unrealistic. While Brutus and Noah's complex relationship drove the first three books, the sudden dismissal (and subsequent marginalization into an ineffective useless and whining character) of Noah and her replacement with her flat and uninteresting daughter Grace was supremely disappointing. Grace's character managed to be an irritating, depthless Mary Sue who's character hijacks and destroys this series previous focus on complex story telling between many vibrant characters and dilutes an otherwise magnificent story into a banal and trite romance.TL;DR Characters are either totally neglected or turned into Mary Sues, I wish I hadn't read this."
2,And it all ends . . . with a whimper,"I've read all of Douglass's series and I usually am disappointed in the last books of the series, so I may be a little biased. But here, it seems like all of the character development from the other books was for naught. What happened to Noah? After having her serve as the central female protagonist for the first several books of the series, it was strange and disappointing to have her so easily supplanted by Grace. Nothing against Grace, but she is not the character who I have come to care about. There is no satisfying end to the tale of the characters we have come to know. Genvissa, Asterion, Brutus, Cornelia, Coel - all are left rather flat. This story could stand on its on without any of the backstory of the other books. That is hardly a compliment to what should be the cumulative final installment in what otherwise was an excellent series. Highly disappointing."
3,slightly disapointed,"I loved the first book, liked the second and fell in love when I read the third. So maybe my problem was I had to wait a year and got my hopes too high. It felt rushed, thrown together and like the author didn't atually know how she was going to finish this and pulled something out of thin air to fix that. The only thing that does save this book is Jacks character devolopment. To see Jack grow was amazing. But to see Noah and Weyland shrink after their amazing growth in the last book... I admit it was refreshing to see someone other than Noah in the front lines. Also Harry seemed very unbelievable at the end. And I would have liked a little more closure at the end with the characters. But, even after all this, the book is still worth the read, just if you have been waiting this long and got your hopes up, you might be a little disapointed."
1,Biased,"Littman is neither a historian nor a good writer, except of second rate fiction. He was denounced in Canada by the Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals for introducing what were deemed to be ""grossly exaggerated"" accounts about ""thousands"" of war criminals in that country, which turned out to be utterly bogus. He never provides hard facts, only speculation...this is not worth reading or owning, I found it when doing a paper for my course on WW II, and am sorry I wasted time reading through it...there are many better books on the Division, such as the one To Battle by Melnyk or even the Heike memoirs."
1,fantasy,"Several US, Canadian and UK Commissions have dismissed any involvement by this Waffen SS Division in any ""crimes against"" humanity. Even the OSI does not bother these people anymore."
1,Sol Littman's Book,"quite frankly, read this book and it is not worth the paper it is written on. Their are alot of historical inaccuracies, inuendos,racist and quite simply, pure fantasy. It would appear to this reader at least that this ""literary effort"" is purely an attempt to make money and should not be regarded as a scholarly endeavour."
4,Fine Fighting Men - Ptooey!,"As you see, this is a subject *I* also feel strongly about and will not let the nonsense below go by in silence.Sol Littman does a good job exploding the myths surrounding these Ukrainian ""patriots"": quislings who helped to torture and terrorize their own people and were Hitler's willing executioners in the Final Solution. Like the myth of the Terror-Famine of 1933, Ukrainian revisionists use their contrived version of OUN/UPA history to pull the cover over their own shameful deeds of the period. Littman does a good job in yet again exposing these frauds, though his writing style could use a little more polish. Still I highly recommend this book as a necessary tonic to the nationalist hogwash peddled by emigre apologists for crime and inhumanity, and their Western accomplices."
1,Ink comes and goes.,"I've never experienced anything like it. Every pen in the box did the same thing - write fine for a few sentences, then die on me. After shaking them and trying again, ink would appear for a few more sentences. Customer service was very good, but a second box of the same pens did the same thing. I wonder if they were stored someplace too hot or cold? Can't say, but it was so odd for new pens to not work."
3,Papermate Titanium,Ok pen I bought it because I like the pencils so much.Cons.A little light feeling compared to the pencil version.Some times have to hit it twice to retract.
4,worked better before.,"The first time I used it on someone worked like miracle, but from the 2nd bottle onwards, it's not the same. Hoping for the best."
3,FYI...Not As Shown In Picture,"The Palmgren 11250 vise I received 12/14/11 is not as nice looking as the one advertised in the picture. Instead of being painted a nice glossy blue color, as shown in the picture, it is a dingy looking flat black. Vise is O.K. otherwise."
2,review of vise,vise is very good and was delivered fast was exactly what i needed and is good quality
1,reason why it as 5 bux,"C&D; was once entertaining, witty, objective and a great read. The staff worked well together and they put out a consistently good magazine. Then it went through some rough years where it got kind of tame and boring. Now, it's an ill fitting mix of new and old writers trying to be fresh and hip while being spoon fed by the car manufactures. The magazine lacks consistency, focus and any sort of clear vision as to what they're about.C&D; mostly seems to print what the biggest manufactures want them to. There have been several articles lately, such as on the new Nissan GT-R and Corvette ZR1, that literally mirror articles in other magazines even featuring some of the same quotes from the same car execs. You might as well go to the manufacture's websites and read their press releases."
2,Steady decline in valuable content.,"I subscribed to C&D; for the better part of this past decade. I used to really value the editors opinions and look forward to the write ups but it has been a steady decline into the stinker. The past 2 or 3 years have a clear ""old-man-car"" or ""rich-guy-car"" bias... Volvo, BMW, etc. It seems like any car with some ""fun"" factor gets ripped apart in the reviews (Lotus, WRX's, MazdaSpeed6, etc.) .I finally gave up on it this year and switched over to Road & Track, much better mag. They're the exact opposite - fun cars mixed with a dash of motorsports reporting.tl; dr; If your back hurts and your nurse cuts your food into tiny bite size pieces, C&D; is the mag for you. Everyone else should check out R&T;."
3,car and driver,the magazine is fine. I have tried to delete the auto-renewal but it still keeps coming up. would you please take care of this? thank-you geneva
4,Good and Getting Better,"For years I subscribed to Car and Driver, and it was my favorite automobile magazine. Then the quality started going downhill, so I let my subscription lapse during the dog days of the auto business from 2008 through 2010. The quality and page count of C&D was at its lowest point. Last year (2011) I caught a few issues on the newsstand and noticed that the quality was getting better. I subscribed at Amazon's cheap price, and it has been well worth it. I plan to let the auto-renew continue. If they screw me on the autorenewal price, I'll update the post."
3,It's Okay,It gives you a great pespective of cars mechanically and from the driver's point of view but it has a sublime but constant political inclination into most articles. To me is clear that most writers are old folks that can't move on from the muscle car era and write with an attitude that things were always better in the past. They could also include more car pictures to some articles. But once you get used to the know it all attitude of the writers and the sublime politics is ok. Plus you can use it to light up your fireplace.
5,For son,My son has been reading these magazines for years and I have just been renewing them on amazon because they always have a good rate.
3,No longer the magazine I grew up with,C&D has really turned me off the last few years. It is more obvious than ever that this rag is for average people who buy average vehicles. The recent redesign is just plain ugly and should be tossed. There are much more interesting (and visually appealing) alternatives out there.
3,Used to be a great mag...,"Unfortunately, when Csebra...Casasba....Csabsbreaedads, er, forget it, Editor CC took over the reigns, the quality of the mag dropped with it. Readers letters, specifically those with constructive criticism, are often met with sarcastic, child-like responses. There was many a time when I agreed with a reader's letter, only to read CC shoot it down. Where is this man's humility?The pictures and layout are still good. Some of the covers promise what looks to be an in-depth article, only to find out inside that it's a one or two page affair. All the US car magazines are swamped with ads, keeping our copy price down, the latter of which is nice. But after 16 years of subscription, I chose not to renew in March. I've been looking at recently resurrected Road and Track, and they have really changed their publication from stodgy old-fart affair to a modern, informative read.Car and Driver doesn't need a new layout. It needs better management."
4,A car magazine to satisfy most types.,"I would have to say that this magazine is informative to the largest group of individuals out there, but I am getting tired of cars above the 78 thousand dollar range. Then again it is for those who pride themselves on knowing every stat about every car out there. Trust me I guarantee its subscribers do not all have Lamborghinis' or Ferraris' or McLaurens'."
1,This Magazine needs a name change!,"I've been reading C&D for a few years now, and while occasionally I'll find something that actually makes me want to finish the entire thing, most of the time its just slamming everything thats not a BMW. The manufacturer bias is so overwhelming that I dont really feel the need to continue reading this. but on the bright side, at least the writers over at 3SM (3 series monthly) are up front about their bias. They even go as far as saying, ""even though the other car was better, we placed the BMW ahead of it, I know the other car scored better in every category and was 10k cheaper, but it cant win if its not a Bimmer hahaha!"" Obviously thats not an actual quote, but its not far off from some ive read. You would think for a Michigan based mag, they might be a less stuck on the teat of a German car."
3,"More Advertisement, Please!","Some of the cars reviewed are truly awesome but most truly unattainable. That said, I find the whole magazine partially attractive. It is not one of those publications that I enjoy from start to finish. I like the reviews on everyday vehicles, those that are affordable to most and look forward to see how the new releases are rated. Besides that a person would have to be a serious car buff to enjoy it thoroughly. For those reviews that pertain I give it 3 Stars."
5,Car and Driver Magazine,"The Car and Driver Magazine is a very well written, comprehensive magazine covering all the new vehicles and features they have. Anyone interested in purchasing a new vehicle should subscribe to this magazine."
3,Autorenew created two subscriptions,"This review is about autorenew - not the magazine itself.Autorenew created two subscriptions on the same magazine. I have contacted the publisher and assume this will be worked out, and can't see a reason why this happened.If using autorenew be vigilant."
4,Where is my magazine????,"I Purchased on July 16, 2012 and have to wait until September 26, 2012 to get my first issue! Not sure why it takes so long to process. Maybe the hamsters are to busy rowing!I like the magazine already so with a six dollar deal I couldn't resist."
1,What's to Review,"If the people who were half as keen to have me review this magazine were actually involved in sending it to me, then there might be something to write about.But when I haven't received the first issue yet.......Pretty pointless."
3,Car and Driver Magazine,"I have subscribed to this magazine and it's predecessor, Sports Car World, for decades, and have found it interesting and often amusing. Its reviews however are strongly biased towards performance, particularly acceleration and handling under aggressive driving, with less emphasis on braking and safety. I read it more for entertainment than to help with car buying decisions. I have found Consumer Reports more helpful with the latter."
5,super fast delivery!,"The person I gifted this subscription received their first issue before Christmas and I had only ordered it on 12/2/12 that' s pretty awesome, thanks!"
1,Not what I was expecting from car and driver,I stopped getting this magazine about 3 years ago. Decided I wanted it again since the price was right the magazine is horrible now. I am sorry I got it again.
4,Good but still a lot of ads,I wish there wasn't as many ads but still great reviews on cars and all kinds of new cars coming out.
2,Weak story and even weaker female lead.,This is the worst Palmer I have ever read. The male is a horrible guy who says things no woman should hear. The female lead has no backbone and repeats herself over and over. Do not waste the money.
2,Should not be called privacy screen,"This screen should not be called a privacy screen. Though it does slightly blur the text from a distance and the side, colors and page layouts are clear as day from across the room. This is not was I was hoping for when I bought this item. I work on the edge of cube-land and don't need all of my co-workers seeing what was on my screen- with this they still can.If you want a completely private screen cover, this is NOT for you."
2,Don't buy this one...,"It's about 50% plastic. The filter is plastic, the handle is plastic. I was really shocked at how cheaply this was made. Get the other one for ten more dollars and get a stainless steel press and have the pot be completely glass."
1,"Cheaply made, broken upon receipt of package","I ordered the 6-cup Assam Tea Press because I drink a lot of tea and it was the only tea-press I could find that was that large. I received my package and found that two of the three plastic tabs that hold the lid/basket/plunger in place when you pour tea were broken and loose in the box. I sent it back for a replacement. Upon receiving the second try, one of the three plastic tabs were broken off. I'm sure it works great but I never got to try it because of the cheaply made plastic assembly. I am trying the smaller version with the glass handle and stainless steel basket to see if the quality is better."
1,Nice modern look but difficult to clean after using,"I really like the appearance of this Bodum teapot, and the ability to see the brewing in progress.That's a plus when using loose tea, but I found that the little leaves got caught in the holes of the steeping insert. Removing them took quite a bit of extra time and attention to detail. Plunging or not plunging made no difference to the problem as the leaves seem to get stuck during the steeping process as the water slowly circulates.I am surprised I am the only one to have mentioned this drawback to date, but perhaps others are not using bulk leaf teas. I suppose using tea bags will solve the problem.This item is now retired from daily use and will be sure to be offered for a dollar at my Spring yard sale. In the end, I found that a Chatsford teapot with plastic mesh filter insert is the best on the market. Finding a Chatsford requires the patience of a Sherlock Holmes. I do wish Amazon would carry them."
3,Thin glass,"It worked well. But the third day I had it, I broke it. The glass is thin, you need to be careful with this one. I wish they had one like this made out of something thicker."
3,Is the platic filter safe to use with boiling water?,"This tea press works fine to me. However, whenever I pour boiling water into plastic filter, it comes to mind if it is safe to use for drinking. Hot water may leach out some harmful materials from polycarbonate filter to tea. It reinforces me after I found out that Bodum introduces recently stainless filter in other tea press model, which is slightly more expensive. They did not address this question in their package or website."
3,Teapress OK but perfectible,"Just got my 1 litre teapress. Did not come with a pad like all Bodum coffee presses; that's disappointing, and sorely missed. I don't find the user-friendliness quite optimal... The press is okay, sort of, but I would just as well like to have the option of another cover to go and serve the tea without that whole column apparatus flip-flopping around the pot's opening, into which the tea press does not fit snugly. Cleaning it is also somewhat of a clumsy affair. I have used loose herbal concoctions and not had the press's holes clog up so far, as a previous reviewer alluded to, but I'll be trying finely cut Russian Kousmichoff tea soon, and will keep my fingers crossed. Finally, while the coffee presses have metal filters and spring-loaded O-rings, the tea press has a silicone O-ring seal and I have my doubts as to its longevity. Voilà! Bonne chance..."
3,"Principle and Form Good, Product Flawed","As other reviewers have noted, the plastic basket in this teapot is very shoddily constructed. It doesn't fit snugly into the rim of the carafe because the plastic tabs are too poor quality. I received my tea press six days ago and the plastic filter, which already seemed cracked and scratched, has gotten much worse for the wear (despite very gentle handling).That said, the design idea is great and the size is perfect. I can imagine that a stainless steel version of the same product would be optimal; if you can find one, buy that instead of this. The tea press is definitely the best way to make tea in large quantities, and is extremely easy to clean."
5,WONDEFUL!!!!,"I love this tea press!! I will be ordering another for my mother for christmas... what better review could there be than that?! If I would reccomend it to my own mother, it deserves five whole wonderful stars. Makes fabulous tea, easy to use and ridiculously easy to clean, looks adorable and holds the perfect amount... I do a half a pot when by myself and a whole pot for tea with a friend... the small size is great and making more is so easy, who cares if you need to make a second pot? It's fun to use, too."
3,"Looks good, ok quality","I bought this tea pot for my wife. She loves it. It looks nice and doesn't look cheap, well, it ain't cheap anyway. Quality is so-so. Probably won't buy another if this one breaks."
1,"Not made for tea, hard to use","This teapot is not designed for brewing tea, instead, it still keeps the coffee making process in its design. To make a good cup of tea, the plunger is never needed. The plunger doesn't stay when you pour. The spout is too close to the lip, so when you pour, the tea may leak from the lip.Also, you only get two coffee mugs of tea out of it."
1,I got rid of mine,I can not possibly understand why they would make the strainer basket out of plastic. Why would I want to subject plastic to boiled water? There is a great deal of concern with plastics reaction to heat today. Is this plastic safe? I don't know. I emailed the company asking exactly what kind of plastic is used. They responded the plastic used is safe for human use. ???That's their opinion without knowing exactly what plastic is used who knows if it is safe. Why not use stainless steel strainers in all their units?
2,Bodum Assam 51-Ounce Tea Press - Poor value,"Took a long time to deliver, missing filter core- plastic material to thin to be durable, returned item"
4,Decent tea press that is easy to use,"Being a novice tea drinker, this is my first tea press and so far, I have been happy with it. It looks good and seems to get the job done relative to making tea. Its main drawback is that it doesn't do a good job of keeping the tea warm enough. I wrap a dish towel around it to help retain the heat. Cleaning the tea out of the infuser is somewhat of a pain, but I think it is just the ""nature of the beast"" and not a design problem. I would definately recommend this product."
4,K,"Crankshaw does a good job of taking you through Krushchev's career. There is thankfully little pop-psyche analysis, rather, there is quite a bit of speculation about what Krushchev's political calculations might have been that led to his behavior. The author does not dwell on the historical events very much; if you don't have any grounding in the era, like me, you might be a little thrown by not understanding some references to various events. My gripe would be that the book ends the day Krushchev left office. I had to look up in an encyclopedia what happened to him next."
4,Behind the Iron Curtain,"This is a very engrossing and detailed book without being a slow read. Crankshaw, a former British diplomat and Russian expert wrote the book in the mid-1960's, so it's a comtempory look at Krushchev when he was the West's archenemy. He chronicles how Krushchev survived politically through Lenin, Stalin and World War Two. It is during WWII, Crankshaw claims, where the future Soviet dictator began to change from one of Stalin's henchmen into a Soviet bureaucrat with a ""vision"". The chronicle of his early days in the Soviet system were very interesting. It truly is a look behind the walls of the Kremlin. I highly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the Cold War and biography."
3,Interesting but limited.,"This is a condensed biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) written in the UK and published in the US in 1964. It makes liberal use of quotes from and critiques of Fitzgerald's own fiction to illustrate various aspects of his short but rather remarkable life. Particular attention is paid to three of his novels; This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night.As a biography, it's far too short to give a complete picture of Scott Fitzgerald, his life and times. For example, there is barely any mention of his daughter. It acquits itself somewhat better as a work of literary criticism, but again, readers really interested in that aspect of Fitzgerald's work would in all likelihood be better served by more comprehensive sources of information."
5,Great book,"Arrived quickly, great item, nicely packaged, low low price. I should have bought two, Would make a great gift for the lover of jewelry"
4,Johnny Tremain was above average,"I read Johnny Tremain as a reader in Challenger in the 5th grade. It is somehow interesting because of the relations with Johnny and the other characters in the book. At the very beginning Johnny encounters a problem that changes his life, but by the end he has matured and finds out that his problem can be fixed. This is also interesting because it has war not only between Britain and the colonists but also with Johnny and the other characters or even with himself. There is also a romantic plot in some parts of the book. Overall I think Johnny Tremain is an above average book but not the best."
1,Poor Performance,If you're looking for a plug to increase mileage or performance look elsewhere. My car is more slugish in acceleration and fuel mileage has actually decreased since installing these plugs. I am going back to the factory plugs.
5,A must read,"I have found this book to be an answer to the confusion and discouragementmany people feel about their church experience. The book helped meput the emphasis of my faith back in proper alignment: on the Lord JesusChrist and the Word of God, which are always relevant in any age, anysituation. I recommend this book very highly to anyone."
4,Interesting reading,"Very interesting reading, especially if you've been a lifetime church-goer. Book had a lot of good points, the main one being the people are the church, not the building or setting. The other main point, being a Christian is all about our personal relationship with Jesus and encouraging others to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ our Lord. Read what the author says at the end of the book after the story is told. I thought it was a bit critical of ""organized church"" as we know it today, especially if you have had a good church experience growing up, however, after reading the book I see the author's points and take the criticism with a grain of salt."
5,"Great message, if you can work through the rhetoric.","I have to say that the writing is not the most skilled in the history of English Literature, however, the message is inspired. The very question that it asks is Why are we convinced that church is supposed to be something that we go to. If you love our Lord, but are struggling with churchianity, this is a good book to read."
5,book about not going to church anymore,"I was expecting something other than what was written, but what was written was what I needed to read. To be honest, I can't remember what it said in the final 50 pages which is where the low-down comes into play. They could have typed up a 50 page booklet and saved a bit of the previous information, but all-in-all, it was worth the read."
3,Enjoy the content - the audio reading is HORENDOUS!,"I enjoyed the content of the book. For me, it was nice to 'read' that you can (and should) seek a spiritual life with GOD outside of the church and not rely on the church of someone to put you in contact with GOD. HOWEVER, the author SHOULD NOT READ THE BOOK. His reading is TERRIBLE. He doesn't even attempt to try and do a different voice for each character and I have no idea half the time who is speaking. WHAT A TERRIBLE AUDIO BOOK. I am going to buy the paperback just so I can re-read it and figure out who is saying what. If you are going to do an audio book at least take the time to have the two main characters read by different people. Just plain painful to listen to."
1,I agree with Challies' review,"Just finished the book. The plot was forced and the characters were weak. Not only was it a poor perspective on life in Christ, it was an empty shell as far as offering any kind of solution. Read Tim Challies' review."
2,so you don't want to go to church any more:an unexpected journey,fairly shallow and misses a lot of the salient points of organized worship. but if i went to a church like the one he describes i wouldn't want to go to church anymore either. he makes it sound as if a good golf day on sunday morning with some professing christians is as good as a day in sunday school. i think there's a lot more to professing christianity than this poor man considers.
5,GOING TO CHURCH OR NOT,"I loved this book! It reminded me of ""The Shack."" They are both worth reading a second time and I encourage everyone that questions this thought, to read this book and come to their own conclusions."
4,Interesting,"A very interesting book, somewhat like ""The Shack"", in the use of a ""man"" to get the point across. And the point: is that much of what's done in church today has nothing to do with having a relationship with Jesus."
5,You really do want too......,"Loved this book. It get's down to the brass tacks of everything that is wrong with the church today...yet helps us to realize that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water. We fix it and move on. God has called the church into existence and it's our responsibility to get our act together to get in line with Him.Great work!!!Todd Ferrell, PresidentThe Evangelical Network[...]415-286-7751"
3,Just So - So,"Kinda' disappointing story (stories), but I've got to admit that it arrived in good shape, and even came a few days early. So far I haven't been real impressed with the book --- but I'm still reading it. Maybe --- Just maybe, I might come back and give it a better review in another week or so ---- but at this point, I don't think so."
5,so you don't want to go to church anymore,with simple words the author has been able to communicate the depth of his pilgrimage with the Lord. very interesting approach ... a book I would suggest for everybody to read.
5,So You Don't Want To Go To Church Anymore,Deep thought prevoking bookeasy readinginteresting to read for a person who doesn't read muchhighly recommended for all Christians and non-Christians
1,Not again!,"After reading The Shack, I thought - ""Wow, now there's a book that talks about a god that is miles apart from the God reavealed in the pages of Scripture."" Now comes another book that again misses the mark of Scripture .. in this case of what the true Church (and its local expression) is all about. All I ask people to do is please read this book for what it is FICTION -- and get your theology (in this case your theology of the church) from the Bible!"
1,Urgh!!!,"Terrible! It was so cheesey and just, terrible! There were a few good spots but most of it read like some sort of mind-control cult thing. Stay away from this one. It had as much personality as an airline mag."
1,This book blows! Shame on those who rated it a 5!,A boring as hell book about a conversation that takes place between two people about things you already know. Don't waste your money. Buy a few draft beers instead.
5,Enlightening,This is a book that provokes one to reread the book of John in the NT. It also creates an atmosphere for discussion on questions we all face on our journey and our relationship with God.
5,So You Don't Want to go to Church Anymore,"Makes you think about your relationship with God and worshiping with an organization and in a building. Bottom line is, you don't have to join a group or worship in a building to be a Christian. Excellent book."
4,Grace is not being promoted in most Churches,"Many Churches need Pastors that understand and teach the full meaning of the New Covenant of Grace, then 75 percent of the problems in the Church would be resolved. They'd better hurry before they lose other members in droves. Some of those in leadership that DON'T teach the full meaning of the unconditional free gift of Grace (which gives us free access to God and His grace as our New Covenant inheritance), and fail to teach the full total package of GRACE (unearned & unmerited favor) so they can control the money flow, or build their own Mega empires might just lose disillusioned members in the long run."
3,Hmmmm...,"I was really looking forward to some encouragement and practical thoughts when I picked up this book. It was an engaging story but I felt a little let down when I finished it. Yes, we are to be His Body when and wherever we go. But what would that look like if the thoughts put forth in the book were really implemented? Paul left each of his budding churches with some sort of group cohesion. I cry for how that has played out for two centuries. I'm all for listening for the Spirit's guidance in all things, I'm just not sure this book did much more than create an awareness of what's broken. I wasn't given much to ""go and do likewise""."
3,Worth the quick read for inspiration,"This book was given to my husband as a gift. It was worth the read as it was in fact inspiring - that the way we think isn't always how things actually are and that God is always moving in and through us and on our behalf for his will to be accomplished in us and others we love life with. The book can be a bit campy. But, for a short read, it was a nice breath of fresh air. And, inspired me to look for what God is doing in every situation - and to try and look for how he might see a situation vs. how I am seeing it in the moment. Also, a reminder that pleasing God and following his word are most important."
4,eyes wide open,"The author brings back to the forefront the main issue that has been obscured by thousands of years of religeon. Through remembering the heart of God throughout the generations, we are brought under the wings of an everlasting love that is not limited by the prison that mankind can inflict upon itself. Thank you."
3,An Indictment of Traditional Church,"This work an indictment of ""organized"" religion, i.e., traditional churches, and their leaders. The clergy in the story are immoral, unethical liars and cheats. Not what I expected, and a bit of a stretch, but interesting work."
1,Like Nails on a Chalkboard,"So you don't want to go to church anymore? Then don't. That's pretty much it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It felt like nails on a chalkboard to my spirit. The concept seemed interesting, but the result is far from it. I actually purchased the audiobook and I could almost see the author on his soapbox as I listened. This is just a rant disguised as christian fiction. I'm not even going to attempt to re-sell my copy because I couldn't even think of spreading this message to anyone else. Not worth it."
1,very disappointed,"I was deeply disappointed & disturbed with the implications in the story line of this book and would urge other Christians not to read or purchase it. It contained subtle compromise to the Word of God andis not sound doctrinely speaking. It would lead others to a misunderstanding of what Jesus Christ taught. Important truths such as the holiness of God and the fear of God, which means that God hates sin and commands all mento repent, turn from sin and acknowledge how far short they fall. Hell and eternal damnation are left out which is also connected with the holiness/purity of God. God does not overlook sin, and Jesus would nothave to suffer all He suffered if it were not because He desired to rescue people from hell and eternal torment. So, the true bilble message of the gospel is left out and will lead people to a false assurance ofsalvation and mislead many to think they are right with God when they are not."
5,Great Read!!,Great Read..........insightful and gives views I had not thought about.Would recommend to anyone willing to grow in your walk with Our Lord.
2,Insightful and understanding but gives no practical advice/application,"If you don't see anything wrong with the structure of the modern church, don't read this book - it will only cause you to ask questions to which it does not give answers. In the first few chapters, I sometimes felt the urge to jump with joy at finally feeling understood in a struggle I thought no one else could relate to. In the second half though, concepts flowed from more being about what church is to the average congregant, and more into Jack's personal life - which those involved in imperfect politics at church may be able to relate to, but which the average churchgoer (or former churchgoer) is unlikely to find the same. Finally, Jack made a little progress in his personal growth, but I was sorely disappointed because there is no practical advice for those who are not seeing Christ in the Sunday morning ceremonies. It seemed only to highlight my problems without offering any solutions."
5,Combines history and highly personal drama to produce a modern masterpiece of the colonial era,"Winter Passage is co-authored by Paul Raymond Cote and Constantina Mitchell. The result of their talented collaboration is a brilliant novel depicting the lives of an heir to a Quebec City mansion and the demented history of the young and damaged woman he encounters when first arriving to the New World from his home in Europe. Winter Passage elegantly combines history and highly personal drama to produce a modern masterpiece of the colonial era. Well written for an ultimately superb read, Winter Passage is a confidently recommended and entertaining from beginning to end."
2,VHS Tape,This is a classic movie but the quality was poor and it was not in great condition as the seller stated. This movie was watched many times. You can tell by the degraded video quality.
5,amazing,5 short stories and I swear each one made me tear up. Especially the first story.. wow. The art is stunning but its watercolor. Its a little different than the usual clamp. But in a good way. Get this manga. So sad and beautifully written.
5,Beautiful pictures and stories...,"I love manga, especially this book (which acutally really started me on manga... I was more into anime before this). I recieved it as a present last Christmas and read it as soon as I could. It is rather repetitive, I have to admit (namely, the quote about the snowflakes being tears of the snow goddess), but the plots and everything else make up for it by far. All the stories are about love and loss, perfect for shojo lovers like me. Buy it... and probably in hardcover, as you'll read it a lot during the snowy days at home. (Mine personally is a paperback and is bent because I have read it so much.) Highly reccommended. =)"
2,Not worth the style,"I have had this phone for 1.5 yrs. I am on my second phone because I thought there was a problem with the first one, but I soon realized with the second one, its just the phone. The phone is slow to keep up with you, you can dial a number and instead of the numbers showing up on the screen instantly, you have to wait for it to catch up with you. When you open the flip, the screen is black for a couple of seconds. I am not happy with the phone anymore, I thought it was soo great...small & cute....NOT worth it. Can't wait to get a different phone(might go back to Nokia)!!"
2,Flip-open stopped working,"3 days after the warranty expired, the phone started to get stuck. And 3-4 more days later it stopped completely! Electronic part that was connecting the lcd to the phone was split in half due to over-usage, I assume. I have no idea how they design flip-open phones that brake due to that kind of usage!Samsung said since the warranty exprired (3 days!) they will fix for $60. Cingular said I should buy a new one for $200. I am not doing any of that!"
2,"Nice design, however, problems with the lcd","I bought mine in March 2004. I dropped it twice, just while putting it into my pocket or purse and now there is a line across the lcd. Before I ever dropped it, there were times when the outside displays very dimly. I owned a nokia phone previously, I dropped it several times and never had a problem."
4,Good bang for the buck.,"For the price, it's not a bad lens at all (for camcorders). I've used it on a Canon Vixia HFS100, HFM31 (step up ring), HFM40 (step up ring) and it's given me the extra bit that I've needed for taking videos indoors (those cameras start at a focal length of 43mm or something). I've also tried it on a HFG10 for the extra bit of wide angle on it.Quality wise, it's not bad as the image remains quite sharp. My only concern seems to be that it gets a little bit soft when fully zoomed in (as in one of my videos... but then again, it was in low light on the M40 so it might be the camcorder itself recording in very low light Didn't look very closely on the S100 or the G10, but it seemed ok in good lighting, so it probably is the low light issue with the M40.It does tend to flare quite easily outdoors, so be careful of those sunny days. Great buy none the less and one of the only few that works with zoom through."
5,Great!!,"Another great Derma E product. This product, along with their microdermabrasion scrub, are hands down the best. This doesn't tingle or make my skin burn, like some glycolic cleansers. It's soothing and works great. Goes on creamy and a little goes a long way!"
3,not so great,"This is an OK cleanser;doesn't dry the skin and is very soothing. However, it doesn't remove make-up AT ALL...hence my disappointment and the three stars."
1,the worst experience,"I received the smooth fitness elliptical for a christmas gift, but it sounded like a train when i used it. It is by far the loudest, most cumbersome elliptical. I've left numerous phone messages for their customer service team, getting no response. Awful service! If you are looking for an elliptical, look somewhere else!"
1,"smooth fitness quality is horrible, noisy, NOT SMOOTH, overpriced!","I have the top of the line treadmill without TV screen. It costs me almost $2000 but makes noise worse than a $500 one. The noise comes from several parts.First, the belt flaps and touches the deck on every steps. The deck itself burnt after only one year of use. The belt itself is too stiff and weak, feels like a cheap plastic.Customer service is horrible, the first call back is around one week later.Warranty is a joke!! I purchased because its long warranty period but they will not service your equipment except sending over a few lubricating oil..."
4,Works well for Peak 8 fitness,We use this elliptical trainer for Peak 8 workouts. Other equipment costs more and I am not sure it does anything different. This does the job and is easy to operate.
1,Didn't work/Unprofessional Customer Service,"This machine was never operational from the first that we purchased it. After a long and arduous process to schedule a repairman to fix it, (it needed a new motor), it still did not work. A customer service representative called me after the initial assessment (and supposed ordering of the necessary part) to follow up on service. He was unaware that no service had been preformed yet and I was required to provide the part number on my machine to order the part that was supposedly ""already ordered"". There were numerous excuses as to why customer service was shoddy and never an apology for the defective, expensive product. The repairman was a contracted""jack-of-all-trades who was ""working on a roof"" and unable to prioritize a customer 3 hrs from his home base. When I complained, a Customer Service represented stated ""WHat do you want me to do for you, Ma'am?"" I thought that was their responsibility. In a nutshell, horrendous service, poor quality equipment."
1,no customer service?,"bought this 4 wks ago, started squeaking after 2 wks of use. have been calling customer service and can never get a live person. after waiting for 15mins it just drops my call. what is going on? expensive machine and not worth it. stay away."
5,An Awesome machine,We got a Smooth fitness elliptical trainer a couple months ago and we love it.It is very easy to use and is easy on all the body joints which makes for a very pleasantworkout. I would highly recommend Smooth Fitness elliptical machines to anyone.
1,No warranties honored,"Smooth fitness doesn't honor their own warranty. They don't return phone calls or emails. The company seems to operate on the assumption that customers don't actually use the equipment, so no failures can possibly occur. If you actually intend to use the equipment, buy elsewhere!"
1,Avoid like the plague,"Regardless of Smooth Fitness' puffery, the truth is that they have no field service anywhere in the world that I know of. When you call for help they give you phone numbers of a ""service technician"" who is either hundreds of miles away or who will not return your phone call. My E/T has only a few hours use on it and it has been sitting in my fitness room for 9 months because there is no service technician that they can send to make a simple repair. As soon as I can save money I am going to buy a new E/T from a real company. Smooth Fitness only makes and sells E/Ts. Avoid them as if they were the plague. Horrible is far too nice word to say about this company.PS I gave the product 1 star because that is the lowest. This is because this product cannot be assembled by just anyone. The company sends the product disassembled."
4,"Good, reliable product","I purchased the CE-7.4 elliptical trainer about 4 months back and am very happy with the purchase. The machine works great and has a much smoother feel to it than I was expecting by purchasing a mid range trainer that you would not typically find at gym (such as a precour, etc). It is very stable even when running at high speeds. The one downside is that the foot pedal on the right side started to squeek after the first few weeks of use and it wont go away, I suppose I will need to get some WD40 when I get around to it. Everything works fine despite this downside which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
1,customer service is TERRIBLE,"I have been trying to cancel my order with this company, Smooth Fitness, for a week now. They could not give me a delivery date on the product I ordered, a treadmill, and threatened to charge even more than the $229 I paid for in home delivery in the first place. Additionally, they charged my credit card the amount of the treadmill and delivery with absolutely no estimated delivery date for the product. I have emailed customer service repeatedly, no response, and have called customer service repeatedly, no human being works there, ""leave a message"" -- Again no response. If this is how they deal with customers before a product is delivered, don't even want to think about how it will be if there are defects once we get it.Cannot imagine how anyone is satisfied with the company!!"
1,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMS SERVICE, DON'T BUY! WASTE TIME!!!!!","IT'S CUSTOMS SERVICE HORRIBLE. DON'T BUY!!! JUST WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!I tried to buy a one for birthday gift. Then after 10 days, they emailed me I have to wait 2~3 weeks for delivery. I don't want to wait that long so I cancelled the order. The customs service person told me this cancelled. But there's no refund after checking my account 2 weeks later. So I called again, they just told me the same, then another 2 weeks past...this is just like you put money in the bank but no interest...will keep posted for the result..."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"Be forewarned that dealing with Smooth Fitness directly is a nightmare. I purchased a treadmill from Smooth Fitness and after waiting for 2 weeks I asked for an ETA. A week later got a call telling me the treadmill wouldn't arrive to the US for another three weeks and then would take another 7-10 days after that to deliver. I cancelled my order and it's taken another 3 weeks to get my money back. I don't know about the quality of the treadmill, but the way they treat customers should tell you something."
1,Nauseating,"Jarabe de Palo is one of the most overhyped Spanish, uh, ""rock"" groups I've heard. Their claim to fame is the title song, which is essentially a long Cuban-influenced cliché. The lyrics for that song and others in this album are even worse. Think about these gems: ""That skinny girl / leaves me a little crazy... / For a kiss from the Skinny One I'd give anything / even for just one.."" and ""You want to call yourself my friend / I'd give my life for you..."" The Backstreet Boys sound like Shakespeare (or make that Cervantes) compared to Pau and the Bunch. I had to endure watching a concert of theirs in Puerto Rico a few months ago... the (local) opening act BLASTED them off the stage. I was literally falling asleep. However, their record label surely has some marketing geniuses. When I see them getting the attention a group like ""Ella Baila Sola"" deserves instead, I just have to cringe."
5,Fantastic!,"This album is one of the best Spanish-language CDs that I own, and it's the one I listen to the most. It's a fantastic blend of music styles and the Spanish is pretty easy to understand; even if you have problems, the lyrics are included so you can find out what the words are. La Flaca was probably *the* hottest song in Madrid last summer, and the sound is just so sexy! Listening to this CD makes me want to get up and dance. This is a must have for anyone who likes Spanish music and salsa/blues/rock rythyms. Most of the songs carry the salsa rythym, though one or two are more rock-sounding. The lyrics are wonderful.I definitely recommend this one. Even if you don't understand Spanish, you'll love the sound of Jarabe de Palo's music!"
3,SINGLE HEAD FIXED OUTPUT UNIT!,I FOUND THAT THE VARIABLE SPEED ASJUSTABLE OUTPUT UNITS START TO HAVE PROBLEMS IN ABOUT 6 TO 8 MONTHS DEPENDING ON HOW OFFTEN THE UNIT TURNS ON AND OFF. THE HOLES IN THE CAM INDEX PLATE START TO WEAR OUT AND THE UNIT STARTS TO SKIP AND NOT PUT OUT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL. IF YOU ARE MECHANICALLY INCLINED YOU CAN TAKE THE UNIT APART AND TURN AROUND THE CAM INDEX PLATE AND THE UNIT IS GOOD FOR 6 TO 8 MONTHS MORE. IF NOT PUT BACK TOGETHER CORRECTLY THE UNIT WILL SKIP OR NOT WORK AT ALL. THERE IS A YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW TO DO IT. AFTER USING THESE UNITS FOR OVER 4 YEARS I THINK THAT THE STANDARD SINGLE HEAD FIXED OUTPUT UNITS ARE MORE RELIABLE. JOHN
4,Tremendous Insight Into The Mind,"This book provided me with a great deal of insight into the connectivity between the brain and the mechanics of the body, the power of thought in reference to brain chemistry, and the tremendous influence of brain chemistry over the actions and reactions I take. A must read in conjunction with this book is Healthy Mind Health Body the Handbook."
5,funny,I was so happy when I found this watch after loooong browsing on numerous sites. I searched for days wanting to buy my friend an interesting gift. I reached a point of total desperation thinking that I won't find a right gift. And then I saw this watch. It was perfect!I wanted to buy it and then I found out (on my total horror) that I can't get it shipped to Croatia. I know that we're small country but one of the things I loved about Amazon is that it has been a rare site which ships to Croatia. And now this... :( Why?
5,Intriguing and Simple,"The New Money Masters provides interesting and insightful backgrounds of the most well renowned investors on Wall Street. Describing their tried and tested techniques and methodologies, you are left to appreciate a multitude of differing opinions and options to consider for your own investment opportunities. Each 'Master' has been illustrated in a chapter, with additional statements and transaction records included in the appendix. Overall, 'The New Money Masters' is a piece of literature that will be a pleasant and invaluable read for any investor, experienced or basic."
2,"Dont expect much, or simply dont expect at all","I read The New Money Masters after the Market Wizards and the New Market Wizards. When I saw ""winning investment strategies of: Soros, Lynch, Rogers, etc etc on the front cover, I immediately bought it. Like any trader who jumps into the market without a plan or thorough study, I lost this trade. Train tried to portrait what's in those masters' minds but he failed. Even worse, his writing skill had been too bad for me to finish reading the whole book. Well, how am I supposed to expect something great from a 379 page book that carries 147 pages of appendix?"
2,Not a very good design,"I bought this bug jar for my 3 year old son after reading positive reviews for it here on Amazon. Fortunately, it's inexpensive. However, I will definitely be buying a different one next time. The plastic scratches incredibly easy, making bug viewing difficult after a few uses. The smaller magnifying glass lens fell out of the green plastic frame on the first day, and I have no idea where that went. The lid is a ""pop-off"" design, which makes snapping it on and off impossible for a child, and even fairly difficult for an adult to use. My final complaint is that it is simply a very small jar. I knew it was going to be small when I bought it, but I was not expecting something THIS small. It's only about 2x3 inches.I wish I could recommend a better bug jar, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of options. If I find something, I'll update my review."
4,This has been my secret to true happiness.,This book was first loaned to me by a friend of the editor. I read the book three times as I began practicing the basic concepts. I bought two copies to give to my sister and return to my friend. My sister has read it several times and has thanked me several times. My wife noticed that I was seeming very gracious and happy and so she read it as well. Now she has written a sermon for her Unitarian church based on it and we are buying another copy to put into the church library. I understand the first few chapters but the last chapters about highest Yogi and death are still beyond me.
5,One of the best introductions to Tibetan Buddhism,"This books is one of the best introductions to Tibetan Buddhism you will find. It is basic, simple, deep, and beautiful. It addresses the fundamental issues of what it is to be a human being, and how we can live deeper lives."
4,easy to read. a joy!,"I knew nothing about Tantra. This book is so down to earth, it's like Lama Yeshe is talking to you personally. It's easy to understand and just a joy to read. But it is an introduction. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because some may think they can buy this book and it's all they need to practice Tantra. Not so. There's a lot to it. But if you're interested in learning what it's all about, this is the perfect book!"
2,Disappointed user,"We have owned this scale for 3 years. It is beautiful and when it worked it worked perfectly and was extremely accurate. But now it does not work. You can step on it and the numbers appear and then disappear. Sometimes they don't appear at all. Tapping, rocking, etc. does not help. Changing the batteries does not help. 3 years for a scale that cost over $100 does not cut it. Update: called Soehnle and they are willing to replace the scale however it is no longer produced and I must pick a different scale. So thumbs up for service."
4,"Sharp-looking, Swiss Movement","I have owned this watch for 2 years and love it. It feels expensive, with a nice weight, and the beveling on the band is subtle, yet unique (in a good way). I can easily tell the time so it functions nicely as a watch and can be worn to formal events or client meetings.The only negative is that since it is an automatic time piece, you're often stuck resetting the watch if you have neglected to wear it for a day or two. I'd recommend purchasing an auto-winding box to accompany it if you don't feel like resetting the time each morning."
1,"Since When Did ""Authentic"" Become Authentic","Spong's arrogance knows few boundaries, yet his wisdom is sharp and keen. Unfortunately, this book is filled with arrogance -- the assumption that the Jesus of Nazareth the world has worshipped for two millennia needs to be rediscovered. Rather than trying to conjecture what could'a been, why not profess what is: Jesus Christ is Lord. The fact that an Anglican bishop doesn't believe the Church's teachings in nothing new, but then to feign naivete and claim to have found some new heuristic is just a tad too silly. Bp. Spong has been looking in all the wrong places, and has come up with a Jesus that wouldn't be worth most our time."
1,This unrecognizable Lord,"Unfortunately, Episcopal Bishop Spong's view of being ""Hebrew"" is probably unrecognizable to Jews or to anyone who doesn't share Spong's specific intellectual vision of 1st century Palestine. Unfortunately also, New Testament studies abound with the writings of people who have quirky visions of 1st century Palestine.No doubt this book reflects Spong's own questions and spiritual search. I have a great deal of doubt whether it offers a *successful* search for ""the authentic Jesus""."
5,good job all around,"the reason i give this product a 5 is because nothing was bad at all. It came within a few days, great price, and the product works great!"
3,Motorola V262 Cell Phone Wall charger,Purchased three of these and one was dead on arrival (DOA)! Still recommend as price was great and the other two units have performed flawlessly.
1,2 bad chargers,"I ordered this charger for my Motorola E815 phone after my replacement one I bought last summer died last month. Well it did not work when I recieved it, I contacted the seller and they happily sent me another one, however that one would switch between charging and not charging. I don't know what the problem is with the charger, I have had no problem using the charger my boyfriend lent me, but these ones I keep ordering do not work properly."
4,"Decent Sound, Good Comfort, Stays in Place","I hate earbuds. They are uncomfortable and fall out when I'm walking. The sound on these headphones is decent, they are comfortable, and they stay in place when I'm walking and running. Given the price, they are a great alternative."
1,best way to throw away $15,"Negative stars.This 'product' is sold under different generic brands. All boast about 'driver size'. I bought pair at Fred Meyer like an idiot.There was nothing good or even adequate about them. The sound was atrocious. Antique earbuds from 1979 were about the same. Despite the hook, they did not stay in place for me and were not comfortable. The wire was stiff and actually cracked! The hooks constantly came apart. The ear foam was crap. The old Jensen Audio company is long gone. It's just a cheap import brand now. Even the website listed here is wrong. Now I think the 'bigger' the driver, the worse the sound. Not surprisingly, they looked cheap when wearing them, too.Get some good earhooks from a quality brand for a little more, or good silicon gasketed earbuds, like Philips."
4,"Cheap, loud, fragile","I have been through at least 10 of these. They come with the RIO MP3 players. They are modular and easy to remove the earhooks and use as buds. You can also adjust the angle of the headphones with respect to the hooks. The wires are light and long enough. They fit my ears well and are really LOUD. If you commute by bike you will appreciate buds that are loud enough to hear over a passing bus. They tolerate a lot of sweat. Downfall- the plug eventually breaks- very frustrating.Pros- cheap, loud and adjustableCons: you will only know if they work for you by buying a pair. The jack will eventually break- particularly if you carry them in your pocket."
2,Waste,"These headphones basically suck. They don't fit well, and consistantly fall out while I'm walking with even the slightest tug on the cord. They don't wrap around very well either. Basically, just don't buy this."
2,Didn't fit my ear and the sound is so so,"These headphones didn't fit my ear and YOU CAN'T ADJUST them. Either they fit or they don't. It's a 50/50 chance. The sound is just acceptable. I also bought Coby Super Bass Digital Stereo Earphones and love it! The sound is excellent and are extremely comfortable. If you need an ear-hook, try Philips."
3,Not bad for the money,"These over the ear earphones are comfortable, as opposed to the earbuds. The sound is ok, but the bass suffers a bit."
3,I wish I had paid more attention to the write up...,"I purchased this for a graduation gift for an Irish young lady, but would not give it to her - just looks too inexpensive; almost like costume jewelery. I guess I just wasn't sure what a pewter, silvertone piece would look like.It's 'okay' for what I paid, but will not use it for the original purchase idea."
5,good title,This title rocks. just read vol. 1 and you will be hooked. and it just gets better with each issue.
2,Some things to consider,"I've owned one of these for about a year. The vacuum has worked fairly well, and you do get a long hose and decent accessories.These come with cheap furniture casters, and not surprisingly one broke a few months ago. Since they are mounted on the plastic ""legs"" that fasten to the side, you can't easily replace them with something better. The casters are not covered by the warranty, and the replacements are featured prominently on the ShopVac site. You must purchase a whole set, depending on your model they are about $3-10. The casters are odd dimensions so you can't easily find a substitute. This seems like a bit of a racket to me, and cheap build quality and unfriendly designs like this drive me nuts.Granted, in the big picture this is just a few dollars, but if this sort of thing bothers you I'd recommend finding something better.Also, note that filters are much cheaper here than on the ShopVac site."
1,It's just plain SILLY,"I looked at the specs, saw it had 5HP, wondered if that would be enough for the 2.5 inch hose, and guesstimated that it probably would be .....- BUT- 12 gallons - although a wonderful capacity -- HOW WOULD I EVER DISPOSE OF THAT MUCH WATER?Does it or doesn't it have a pump-out capability for a hose? Who knows?So, I can't buy it - the thought of trying to lug the sheer weight of 12 gallons of water to heaven knows where, - well, it's too much for me to even contemplate -"
4,Wise views from an elder,"I found this collection deep in wisdom and the kind of perspective only someone who is older and mature can give. Her three stories at the end of the book of same events described in the differing voices of a grandmother, her daughter, and grandmother were extremely insightful in showing how each of us experiences an event through our own emotionally laden perspectives. Even the simplest tale here is deep in its wisdom and its multilevel insights about relationship, change, and growth."
1,bad is an understatement,textbook. its boring. save the money and use Wikipedia and the lectures if no need to cite arises. hope all is well.
5,better than Aquacart,"These are a whole lot better than the Aquacart version, which is lightweight steel tubing with a cheap paint job so you'd better not plan to use it outside where it will rust. And the Aquacart arrived with incorrect parts and their customer service is horrific. Stay with this galvanized heavy duty model."
3,Pretty Good Inro to Shotokan,"The basic blocks, strikes and kicks are covered pretty thoroughly. My complaint is that the first two katas are demonstrated, but not covered in detail. Also, the order of instruction seems odd: the warmup exercises are at the end. Also includes some useful Judo throws and holds. There's a bit too much filler of people free sparing."
2,poor photos,"The book itself is good but when compared to the hardcover edition the poor quality of the photos is evident. Since I do not need to use these photos for my class it is not a major issue, but if you will be working directly from the book you might want to consider purchasing the hardcover."
3,"Information Rich, but not the more organic organization.","this is a great book with lots of information, however like so many textbooks its a bit difficult to get out what you want, information is organized alright but not amazingly well. I have used other a. photo books that do a better job.all in all its worth it.I should mention I did not buy this for a class, obviously if you need it for one then this review is irrelevant. but its worth having on hand as a general reference."
3,Remote Sensing,I bought this book and it took almost 3 weeks to receive even after I paid expedited fee. It should of arrived within a week as everything sent expedited comes up in Alaska by air. The book was for a class I'm taking at UAA.
5,Much better than I expected,I have been disappointed in Science Fiction now for at least twenty years. This was the first SF book I had read in years. It reminds me of Heinlein's and Asimov's best. I guess that is the best recommendation I can give. The book combines SF and Mystery/Detective fiction seamlessly. The flow is smooth and the characters are well developed and not wooden. There is a little stereotyping but very little. A great read and an enjoyable book.
4,Unexpectedly Awesome!,"There are two things wives should not buy their husbands, clothes and books. My wife broke this rule and picked up PHOBOS for me while at the bookstore...I have decided it's only clothes that are off-limits for her now! This book was a very fun and mature read in the classic SF tradition, I consumed it in one setting and was sad to see it end.I hope there are more to come from this author, he's on my ""must read"" list for life."
4,History for preschoolers,"This is a great story to read out loud, because the dog Seaman has a great adventure. Sneaking a little history into a fun story is good for young ages."
1,The power of Mantras: Sanskrit Pronunciation problems,"The cassette study guide is good; however, the quality and pronunciation of Sanskrit words and chants is poor at best. The language of Sanskrit uses highs and lows, pauses and stresses, to convey the meaning and energy; such authentic breath control and voice modulation is nowhere to be seen in the chant-recordings in the two audio tapes on the Power of Mantras."
3,interesting,the first two are very good. the last one is thrown together and has some inaccurate stories.
1,Beware this media!,"Like lunor, I got a spindle of defective TDK 16x CDR media. The writes fail at approximately the same place on each blank CDR.I don't think I'll be buying TDK in the future, although it *used* to be my favorite brand!"
1,Junk Buy another brand,I bought 3 spindles of 100 of these things. About 90% of them are coasters. If they burn at all they have to be burned at the lowest rate my burner will do (4x) and then they still have a high error rate. The reflective coating is so thin you can see through it. I have bought this brand for years. Never again.
3,required for a class,"The content of the book looks very well thought out, and is broken up enough with pictures etc. to keep it in manageable chunks. I bought it for my daughter's Honors World History class, but will probably read parts myself for enjoyment."
3,received,I received the book early; that's good. The book's condition was not quite up to description. The first page was ripped out. The front cover had a 4 in cut and the ends of the pages were written on. Not up to a good rating I would think.
1,DOA for a scale,most of the buttons to set/reset didn't work.and these buttons are not aligned correctly inside the hole.need better QC.returned it next day.
1,Dead out of the box!,"I just got this item and although it looks pretty cool, it did not work. I followed all the instructions and all I ever got was 0.0 lbs (not even close! hahahaha). Anyway, looks like the customer support number is in Denmark or something, so I will be returning tomorrow."
3,Sir Loin is Wrong,"I'm afraid Sir Loin is wrong. Any scale that uses springs or strain guage technology measures weight, not molecular mass. The reason for this is that weight is gravity dependant, mass isn't. (for example, your weight would be about 1/5 that which it is on earth if you weighed yourself on the moon, but your molecular mass would be the same). The balance beam scales (the kind you seee in gyms and the doctor's office) measure mass, as gravity affects both the person standing on the scale and the weights that you slide equally. As for kilograms measuring mass while pounds measure weight, that's pure rubbish."
3,Works as designed,"Only 3 stars because it's a little difficult to use in a vehicle due to it's shape. Car seats slant backward and trying to lean forward so I could use this properly was quite an excercise. I must have looked pretty funny. Also, the lid is a little tough to screw on correctly and this is one lid you want to make sure you get on tight!"
2,cheapy,"I bought this one some time ago and I was completely happy since it was for my 5 yr boy, I just had to wrap him in his fleece and he do it in the bottle very easy but the cap just broke down after 10 uses, I will check another brand since for me it was very helpul the idea but not this particular seller"
3,I should have read the reviews first...,I was too excited to read the reviews before getting replacements. My dog (80+ pound G. Retriever) loves 'em but destroyed them too easily. I should have known after he popped a Tuff ball tennis ball. I had not heard about the chemicals claim. Scary.
1,not worth it,These balls fall apart in a week. My two German Shepherds that love tennis balls and keep them for months tore through these balls in a week.
5,reminds me of my teenage years.,I saw this movie when I was a young teen and loved it. It reminds of the good old days with the old cars and music.
3,I Married A Monster From Outer Space,"This little gem from 1958 has always been one of my favorites along with The Monster That Challenged The World and Them! The special effects are typical 50's but still great fun. Maltin gives it 2 1/2 stars and I give it 3 simply because I can salivate an extra half a star just in anticipation of it's release. Oh, by the way my next salivation will come when they release The Incredible Shrinking Man, can't wait."
3,"Women are heroes, men are monsters","The cars are VERY big, and the sweaters are VERY provocative in this B horror show from the 50's. The truly ugly aliens which inhabit the bodies of a few regular guys who inhabit Main Street, U.S.A. are foiled by beautiful Marge and a stand in for Rin Tin Tin. Well made, fun, with good acting throughout."
2,NFL Kids Watch,"The watch looks really good and seems to be very sturdy. However, the watch is not meant for younger kids. My son is 8 years old and the watch is entirely too big. The watch is adjustable but even at its smallest adjustment it was too big. I think this watch is for children 12 years and older."
1,Tim's K Cups No Worky So Good,"Sadly I had a terrible experience with Timothy's brand K-Cups. Only occasionally (1 out of 5) would these cups work properly in my maker--never had a problem with ANY other K-cup we have purchased (and we have 5-6 brands in the drawer at any given time). These cups would almost always back up into the maker creating a huge mess and half an undrinkable cup of coffee complete with most of the grounds from the K cup.Look like I just got a bad batch, but by the time I realized these were problem cups, the Amazon 30 day warranty had run out, leaving me no recourse other than to give them a negative review."
5,Great coffee,I had not been very impressed by the K cup coffee until I discovered this blend. It is a great strong coffee that stands up to any Starbucks brew. Great if you like a bold rich coffee.
5,Deep and flavorful,"Timothy's Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso is one of my favorites. Don't let the espresso word fool you - it's full and flavorful, but certainly not a true espresso. I drink mine black at either the small or medium cup size and love it. My other favorites are Green Mountain's Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold, Lake and Lodge and also their National Wildlife Blend."
5,Tried many k-kups - this is by far the best!!!!,"We've had our Keurig B60 model since last Christmas and have tried many different kinds of coffees. I probably wouldn't have tried Rainforest Espresso because I don't care for Espresso; however, my sister-in-law told me it was great and that it didn't taste like Espresso but was very rich and bold. We ordered some and it was great! I have been ordering it ever since and will continue to order it every month. The only disadvantage - I have some boxes of other flavors that are getting stale on my shelf!"
5,Great Coffee,"I love my Keurig coffee maker, and have just discovered that I can buy the coffee thru Amazon ... a little cheaper and ""Prime"" shipping! This flavor is for those who like rich, strong coffee with a hint of espresso flavor."
5,Best Morning Coffee Ever!,"After drinking Starbucks every morning for the past 6 years, I got tired of the taste, cost, and increasingly rude semi-stuck up staff. I thought they were the servants? Never mind. After purchasing the Keurig machine and using up all of my free K-Cups, I began researching all of the available coffee brands and types for that extra bold, yet not bitter taste. I read numerous reviews online and at the end everything pointed to Timothy's World Coffee Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso.This is undoubtedly the best tasting coffee I've ever had. It's very bold and yet you don't taste any bitterness at all. I look forward to my morning coffee at my office and miss it on the weekends. If you like the bold taste of Starbucks and yet hate the bitterness and burned taste, you definitely need to give this coffee a try."
4,GREAT COFFEE,"This is great coffee for packaged singles... By the way, I haven't found a site with a better price to buy Timothy's anywhere. Amazon seems to be the most reasonable."
3,Not what I expected...,This is a somehwhat stronger blend but not what I expected in an espresso roast. There was no deep intense flavor typical of a good espresso. Even tried this on the smallest cup setting but it did not live up to expectations.This is a decent medium /bold roast but not an espresso.
3,What's with the NEW price ??,"Am i wrong, or has the price of the BOLD coffees gone way up recently ??BUYER BEWARE ! You can get this at Amazon for about $23.00 Watch who you order coffee from !"
3,"Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso","Not a big Timothy's fan...doesn't have much bite, just a bit flat."
5,Awesome Coffee,"My mother and sister bought me the K-Cup coffee maker for Christmas and it came with an assortment of K-Cups with it. After tasting Timothy's, I decided that was the taste of a rich cup of coffee that I liked. I then went on line and found this at amazon and signed up for the automatic shipment program. If you like a dark roast coffee, then this is the coffee for you. It's not to bitter like expresso, but more like a deep french roast. You can't beat the price, and with the automatic shipment you will never run out."
5,The Only Way to Buy K-Cups,"I drink a lot of coffee, so buying K-Cups at the department store is prohibitively expense. This coffee was excellent and the price was extremely reasonable. Throw in free delivery and this is the only way to buy K-Cups (even cheaper than eBay and so much less hassle)"
4,"TIM'S EXBLD RF ESPRESSO REVIEW... BLAH, BLAH, BLAH","Okay, I just tried 2 boxes of Tim's Ex.bold RF Espresso because I wanted to try a flavor that reviewed as opposite to the Gloria Jean's Breakfast Blend I had just finished.Well, this is it.... Mud! And it's excellent mud at that. The reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because it sort of tastes like they added ""bold coffee flavor"" to the bean itself. It's hard to describe. I believe most coffee companies do this type of thing to help enhance their flavors, but I could really taste that, if that makes any sense to you?I just ordered Coffee People's Donut Shop because I wanted to try a somewhat milder roast. If I don't like it, it's nice to know I can trade it at Yahoo's K-Cup Exchange (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/) for something I do like. I can review the Espresso there as well."
5,The ABCs of Bridge,"I purchased this bood used and it was described as something like ""fair"" condition, so I knew it would be somewhat worn. In fact it was in slightly better condition than I expected and so I would give this purchase an excellent rating. It arrived in a timely fashion and I am thoroughly enjoying the book."
3,"Facts, not explanations.","I read a bridge book a few years ago, whose title I really wish I could remember, that did a wonderful job of explaining the logic behind the bidding system, so that even if you forgot a detail of some convention, you could figure out something reasonable. It made bridge ""make sense.""This is not that book.This book is very heavy on the facts, without much context, presented for you to memorize, memorize, memorize. Do this, do that. If this, then that. I enjoy learning, but after dozing off on three separate reads, I realize I need to look elsewhere.The best parts of this book are the quizzes he presents to test what you just memorized. Maybe it would be okay as a reference. But for instruction, there are more readable texts out there that offer better use of your time."
4,Not quite for rank beginners,Good book that covers the basics but I would encourage rank beginner bridge players like me to take a lesson with a good teacher who will make the game ccome alive. The book made much more sense to me after I had one lesson from a dynamic teacher (Gail Greenberg) who explained the game's goals in terms that I could understand--bridge is like a war where you and your partner are allies and where communications are limited.
2,Humperdink,"Humperdink's Busy Day is part of the Richard Scarry's Busy Day Storybooks series. Humperdink is the baker in Busytown. The baker has to wake up early to bake bread for the town and runs into other people that work early in the morning. He goes through the preparation of the oven, making the dough and baking the bread. When they finish they display and deliver the bread. This is a wonderful book to introduce children to the occupation of bring a baker. The animal characters are wonderfully drawn and the make believe town is enchanting. The illustrations are very detailed but might be difficult for very young children to truly enjoy. The print might turn some children off because it is quite small for a picture book. It is a great book for a parent to read aloud with their child while they turn the pages."
4,It was the first book that got me hooked!,"Last year, two girls got attacked by Mr.Farberson, the murderer of his wife, Susan.He got sentenced to jail for 20 years. Now he's back for revenge!"
2,Not very helpful,There are plenty of free James and the Giant Peach review questions available on the internet....we need not have purchased this book.
2,It is a don't,"Even though the film is made with great artists, it is so stiff, mainly Hercules Poirot, so false, that is becomes a strain to watch it. It is a pity, for the book is excellent. What a dissapointment!!!!!!!Eugenia Lizalde."
1,Can't imagine a worse Poirot,I was totally repulsed by Albert Finney in the role of Poirot. He had absolutely none of the characteristics of Christie's Poirot...none. Did the director ever read a Christie? Finney brought no dignity to the role at all. All I could think of during the movie was how inappropriate the casting of Poirot was. I even began to dread every appearence of Finney!!About the rest of the movie: So many good actors...so little direction. Too much earnestness brought into the role resulted in quite a bit of over-acting. Particularly from Wendy Hiller (Princess Dratwhatshername and from one of my favorite actresses Ingrid Bergmann. Even Sean could do with better direction.I stuck with the movie because it was a Christie. A waste of 2 good hours.
3,WONDERFUL MOVIE...great BONUS FEATURES....lousy transfer,"Lets get things straight..this is a wonderful film...skillfully made, direction, score, sets , and the actors...wow!re: the DVD...the bonus features are terrific...why the lower than great rating?It seems Paramount has chosen to master from a laserdisc...one with the early stages of laser rot....that is why there are spreckles through out the film....and why I'm deducting stars....but for the price...its a steal! you will not be dissapointed in the movie or extras!"
5,AGATHA CHRISTIE's BEST,"This 2-tape movie is contagious, and well worn, here. Sharp dialogue, swift, and subtle clues that are planted right in front of your eyes. Traveling the Orient Express Train as a last moment plan, a common character with a superior mind, Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney), is forced into investigating a murder. But which mystery is more important, who was killed, why he was killed, or how and by whom?ADD: Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Widmark, John Gielgud, Martin Balsam, Jacqueline Bisset, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Rachel Roberts, Michael York, and many others. The unbelievable is made real."
4,One of the best adaptions of Agatha Christie,"Though it`s hard to forget the solution once u have seen it once, it remains a treat because of the starpower and the fact that they don`t make`m like that any more.Ingrid Bergman is good as Greta Olsson and claimed that she was originally offered the Wendy Hiller-role, but wanted to be Swedish(She was of course, with a German mother who died when Ingrid was two years old. Her father died when she was 12 and being a photographer, filmed her at all times. But times damaged the negative and her heritage was thought lost forever. It was only when she came to Hollywood that her boss David O. Selznick restored the footage and she was able to see her mother Friedel on film for the first time).Lauren Bacall is to my mind - the standout here - in a drama borrowed from the tragic Lindbergh-kidnapping case in 1932."
1,Finney looks like a stuffed flounder imitating HITLER,"I don't think anyone can do justice to Poirot like David Suchet. I've seen a few actors attempt it but they come off looking silly. Finney is probably the worse, wheezing through his lines with the worse Belgian accent I've ever heard. He looks like a stuffed flounder doing an impression of Hitler. Whoever did the makeup and costumes obviously didn't read any of Agatha Christie's Poirot novels. Suchet owns the role!! Finney is just there for the yuks."
3,Sometimes Bad Movies are worth a look; this ain't one!!!,"This cd was purchased for my dad, an advid TCM viewer.I ADORE a TIMELESS story (Casablanca, Layer Cake), a good who done it (Maltese Falcon, Fatal Attraction) or a good Gangster Movie (Roaring 20's, Good guys, Scarface (both), GodFather I/II, Casino, etc.). This, I hate. First, the production values (70's) make it dated. Second, there will only be one Richard Blane, American (Bogie) just like there will only be one H. Perot (Ustinov) and he ain't in this one. Third, none of the actors are memorable---remember in high school when one student tried to do an Erstadz Jewish accent and it was laughably bad? Well, imagine 30 wretched accents by wretched British actors and you have this 'mess' of a movie. For Rail Road buffs o-n-l-y!!!I'm sorry but there are thousands of movies out there that will enrich your life seeing them; this ain't one of them!!!"
2,Great Movie - But FINNEY sucks!!!! as Poirot,"The movie is great, the screen-play is wonderfull, the cast can`t be better and the mistery is great!!!! No problem.But,,,,,,, FINNEY!! Oh my good, his performence is terrible, very bad, sorry, but that is not the Poirot that Agatha Cristie mentioned in her books, cant understand a word he said, very very bad!!!! he was screaming all the time, not talking, screaming, pretending that he have no neck, lack of intelingent. That`s not Poirot. I have to say that Poirot is only one : DAVID SUCHET!!!!!!!!!! MR.DAVID SUCHET IS POIROT, that is , that all.Like i said before, the movie is Great!! But Finney ... very bad actor , at least playing Mr. Hercule Poirot.Two star because the movie is great, but i cant give 4 or 5 star when Finney didn`t made a good job playing Poirot."
2,A Strain,"This was a strain to watch. Nothing like I thought it would be. Finney was plain old awful and I had to actually watch the ending 3 times before I knew what was going on. I rented this on a rainy weekend and thought it would be fun trying to figure out who did it. However, no clues were given at all that would help the viewer guess. In my opinion, that's what's so entertaining about mysteries. This was just a bunch of very short interviews that made little or no sense to someone who hasn't already familiar with the story."
2,A classic gone wrong.,"I couldn't wait to receive my version of Murder on the Orient Express. I think Agatha Christie is an excellent writer, but the film leaves something to be desired. Better character development and editing could have raised the value of this film to a five-star masterpiece.Too much information remained missing. There weren't many clues for the viewer to use in finding his/her own solution. That is the fun of a mystery movie. The editing was horrible. The train travel segments were way too long, taking up valuable time that could've been spent developing the characters, providing information and setting a darker tone. After all, there was a murder.The performances of the star-studded cast were great. But no one got the chance to really show their acting skills. Therefore, the film was quite clinical in presentation. The plot was not lacking. But the execution of the storyline was disappointing. I don't recommend the film, even to Agatha Christie fans."
1,You can only shake your head,Without a doubt this travesty is one of the 10 worst movies ever made. Finney is to Poirot what Woody Allen is to Lawrence Taylor. He is terrible. The whole movie is terrible. I can't believe it was released at all.
3,Restored ?,"There's nothing on the DVD case claiming that this film has been ""restored"".Under ""Special Features"" it is described as ""Widescreen Version - Enhanced for 16:9 TVs"".The image fills the screen of my Sony 16:9 TV. There are no black bars on the top and bottom of the screen as noted on the DVD case. Perhaps these only appear when the DVD is played on a 4:3 TV. It does not play with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 as stated by Amazon.The film is speckled throughout with white dots and other imperfections.The ""Set Up"" options on the disc offer ""English 5.1 Surround"", ""English Restored Mono"" and ""Franais"" as audio options. The only ""restored"" part of this film is the English mono audio."
4,A little too heavy on the accent,"This is a good movie. But I can't understand a thing that the detective is saying. His accent is too thick. It's almost as if he's speaking another language entirely.I can pretty much figure out what he's saying throughout the movie. But when it gets to the end and he's got everyone together in the same room and is explaining everything to them, I've absolutely no idea what he's saying. If it wasn't for the ""flashbacks"" while he's talking, I wouldn't know who killed who and why even after watching the entire movie. Someone who doesn't have such a horribly thick accent should have played the part of the detective."
4,Starts out slow but has a surprising ending,"This movie drags on for the first 35 minutes or so. They could have easily condensed introducing the enormous ensemble of characters into 10 minutes or so.The first 6 minutes does not have any dialogue. However, it contains important information for the movie. You may want to watch it twice, so that you can catch everything that is going on in the introduction.The only things that kept me from turning this movie off in the beginning were the costumes and the sets. This movie is a period piece set in the 1930's. The train ride was first class all the way.This movie was worth watching for the costumes, the sets, the brief appearance by Sean Connery, and surprise ending. I recommend it for a one time viewing."
4,Sleuthing At Its Best,"Being a great Agatha Christe fan of her written word it is with great pleasure that I have begun colleting her works to be viewed. A business man with a very shady past is found murdered on the Orient Express and that master of the whodunnit, Hercule Poirot, is there to solve the mystery and identify the guility person before the train reaches the international border crossing point and the local police take over; he agrees to interview the passengers in the Calais Coach to accomplish this. In true Agatha Christe style, Albert Finney, Hercule Poirot, unfolds the sinister, complicatd, twists of the plot to the delight of all viewers."
5,Best movie of a Christie mystery,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in 1974. It's great to finally see it on DVD. The all-star cast and lavish sets make this a delight to view. And unlike some movie adaptations, this one is very true to the book.Finney is certainly the second best Poirot, Suchet is the most true to character. But I expect a new Murder on the Orient Express movie staring Suchet would be disappointing compared to this masterpiece. (Judging by comparing the two Death on the Niles)."
4,Almost great,"Why do they have to change all the character's names??? This otherwise excellent treatment of an excellent book suffers from having all the people with new names. And my ultimate Poirot will always be David Suchet, followed by Peter Ustinov and then Albert Finney. The show is saved by excellent (if somewhat overacted at times) performances. They did avoid rewriting the story. Overall, top entertainment and one of the best mystery novels to date."
4,Not as bad as some say,"Having read some of the reviews on this movie, and noting that most are bad, I feel that I should get my two cents in. Poirot: Not as good as David Suchet, but not as bad as some seem to think. He does at least two things that Suchet does not. He holds his head a little to one side, and he limps. That alone deserves cheers. The rest of the cast, especialy the Princess Dragomiroff and the Comtess Adrenyi are supurb. The secretary was, I admit, disappointing, but not enough to spoil the film. So why do I only give it four stars? One reason is that it is, at points, too free with the plot, changing this and that. The other reason is that I object to profanity (a vice which Dame Agatha dappled in) and the four innuendos. This film, though not, of course, on the level of the book, is supurb. A must-watch."
3,A classic murder mystery from Agatha Christie,This film is a great classic murder mystery which we need to see more of. teh film follows a detective who is on board the orient express when a man is murder there he interviews alla bord to find the killer. The acting is great and the plot is great making the film great.
2,Very frustrated with fake accents!!,"As an avid Agatha Christie fan, I was thrilled to receive this movie as a gift for my birthday. I had watched the two other movies staring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot and absolutely LOVED them!! However, I was so bored and frustrated throughout this movie. Albert Finney was a terrible Poirot. I honestly could barely understand a word he and some of the other actors were saying. The accents were barely comprehendable. I had to play and replay the end where the mystery is solved. I am very upset my husband spent the money on buying this movie as I am sure that I will never be able to sit through it again. The plot was great, however, some of the acting was horrid. I am only giving it two stars because it is based on an Agatha Christie novel. Based on the film itself; no stars. If you can understand even half of what Albert Finney is saying, you're a better woman than I."
3,"Finney's not too impressive, though the movie is quite.","Altogether, a very entertaining movie, good acting etc. But one thing I feel very strongly about is that FINNEY IS NOWHERE AS CLOSE TO POIROT AS DAVID SUCHET IS. Finney doesn't quite have the panache of Poirot...not that he has anything else.But, yes, the movie is almost excellent, and a must see."
4,Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express,"I bought this because my daughter had never seen it, and we could not rent it around here. I still like it, and it was a way to see Lauren Bacall again. He book was great, and I could not remember the movie so I bought it to remember. I would recommend it to a friend as a great who-done-it."
5,if you love poriot or just whodunnits buy this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,great movie well plotted whodunnit normally i only like david suchet as hercule poriot but here finney is perfect the supporting cast is perfect ( try to spot ingrid bergman) the music perfect i saw here on the special features that the director was trying to make it with all the grandness of the old classic movies he suceeded oh and great special features!!!!!!!
5,nice watch,"the band is very large, so will fit just about anyone. It is like the old spandex style band, you can't really tell that from the photo."
4,Not too bad,"I think Drol does a good job of presenting OOP techniques with a language that is not particulary friendly to OOP. If you have some basic programming under your belt, you'll get more out of this book. Although advanced coders, may not find the book as useful."
3,Hard to follow,"If you are new to object-oriented programming, this book can be very difficult to get through. The exercises can be dry and often do not really apply to real-world problems. Also, there are no examples included (no cd)."
5,Great Completer for my home Theater,"When I bought my top of the line home Theater,7.1 (Output Channels for left front, center, right front, surround left, surround right, and subwoofer[the usual 5.1 configuration] PLUS two back separately driven integrated speaker channels for 7.1 config), I searched for the then top of the line subwoofer/speakers setup. Infinity TSS-450 was packaged for 5.1 sale, with the option to add individuals. I bought the package of 5.1, and a year later added one back, which accepted both back inputs. A year later, I bought this one, separating the back channels. The small but powerful speaker brings the room together. View ""We Were Soldiers"" and crank the sound up!! Better wear flack jackets and hard hats, though."
3,Bkfelix,"Soft cup of coffee, better than most pods but not even close to a fresh cup of real quality Kona."
1,Bad batch or bad taste buds??,"Perhaps we received a bad batch (all 50 K-Cups) or maybe our taste buds are going bad or not as refined as they should be. At any rate, no one in our family likes this Kona although we all love the Tully's Kona and almost everything that we have tried from Green Mountain. This Kona had a very objectionable aroma of something like rotting leaves, causing its taste to seem likewise. The expiration date was 10/19/07. We are going back to Tully's Kona even though we have to pay more for it because Amazon doesn't seem to offer it."
5,better then most,we have found that this kona blend is not to bold but like fresh brewed coffee and smells and tastes the best of all we have tried and we have tried them all
2,Had better,This was not my favorite one for the keurig brewer. it is hard to get a real good cup of coffee from it anyway and this was my least favorite. i mostly use it for the convenience. I did like other blends from Timothys tho. But really coffee is a personal thing.
2,Inconsistant Quality of Flavor,"I love KONA and was looking forward to this blend, BUT it is always a gamble when I make it to see if it will be rich and satisfying or weak and bitter. This shipment of K-Cups shows no quality control at all. I don't know what happened, Timothy's is usually extremely good, but this is a BAD flavor for coffee lovers. Nothing makes me madder than to get a weak, bitter cup of coffee first thing in the morning. Don't buy this blend, you will be disappointed, I was."
2,A bit weak,"This is a medium blend, and I like my coffee much stronger. Even at the lowest water setting, it's still a light cup. I'm much prefer to get a darker, bolder blend and use the middle water setting. Just not enough umph for me."
5,A little bit of heaven,"Coffee is so hard to describe but this Kona blend is so wonderful that it reminds me of coffee flavored ice cream. You get that true coffee taste without being bitter or overly strong. This is now my new favorite. I love the Green Mountain and will continue with it but I must admitt I like this better. Give it a try, I am sure you will be pleasently suprised."
2,Kona?,"I guess it doesn't take much to call something Kona. Not objectionable, but fairly weak, insipid coffee. Not a good example of what you can get from a K-cup."
5,Best choice for non-flavored,My choice and of my office workers for best variety of non-flavored. You can;t go wrong with Kona even if it's a blend.
2,Timothy's Kona Blend,I was not overly happy with this coffee. There simply is not enough taste to it. I found it to be very weak. I love other Kona blends (Tully's) however Timothy's does not wow me. I was disappointed in this brand/type of coffee.
2,okay taste,"If I have to drink it I will, but it certainly isn't fantastic. It is mild and tastes like bad coffee. I prefer a bolder darker taste."
4,Good Tasting,"This Kona Blend is very smooth. If you want a nice and easy blend for entertaining guests, this is the perfect fit."
4,Great Harlow & Tracy!,"This is a wonderful old thirties gem with Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy, who exude some real chemistry! Some typically corny 30's plot elements - girl takes the ""fall"" for the man she loves - but that's what makes it great!"
5,Sarah McLachlan,How can you not love the music of Sarah McLachlan? Her voice is pure and mesmerizing.
4,"In the Arms of An Angel and More, S. McLachlan",This cd is an amazing compilation of the best of Sarah McLachlan live and acoustical! Great cd!
2,Not worth it,[YAWN]. As if we haven't heard enough of Angel and Adia! Afterglow is her new album yet there are three songs from Surfacing and only two from Afterglow. Once again Sarah McLachlan is selling her fans short.
3,Mixed Feelings....,"My son's kindergarten teacher recommended this book because she feels my son fits the ""Indigo"" model so closely. I had never heard of the book ""Indigo Children"" or its sequel, and I must say that each and every description of the ""Indigo Child"" echoed my own characterizations of my son. In a way, this is a relief. I do think the advice the book offers is already helping my son. I understand why the old ""because I said so..."" paradigm never works with my son, and I see how his hyper-sensitivity results in such an overwhelming flood of emotion. I'm verrrrrrry skeptical however of the assertion that this ""Indigo"" label applies to an entire generation of children and that they've come from another plane or planet to help emancipate their fellow earthlings. This element of the argument undermines the credibility of an otherwise compelling and helpful approach to raising and understanding kids that don't blend in or conform."
4,good product,"This is overall a good product. Easy to assemble, sturdy, and just about the right size (any bigger and it might be a ""clutter"" contributor). My daughter seems to like it for her beloved animals."
5,Great little cradle,Purchased this cradle for my 3 yr old and she loves it. Very easy to assemble (less than 10 mins) and pretty durable so far. Very cute and is the perfect size for toddlers.. Also love the finish.. Easily wipes clean with water and paper towels. I would highly recommend this to others.
4,"Easy to put together, cute","This cradle was easy to put together and super cute. The ""bedding"" inside leaves something to be desired, but my daughter used her little blankies to cover up her babies. It's not a super versatile toy- there are only so many times you can lay the baby down and rock it, but my daughter goes back to it a couple of times a day."
4,Better than plastic,I would say these are way better than the plastic ones we had in the past. It doesn't fall apart. Only draw back is the blanket and pillow it came with are super cheesy and cheap.
4,"As cribs go, this is a good one","My daughter insisted she get this crib. It came in a timely manner, was SUPER easy to put together (she helped)and so far she seems to really love it."
5,Lil' Doll Cradle review,"This adorable cradle was much sturdier than I had imagined. It was INCREDIBLY easy to assemble, as the directions were very clear and concise. Took this techno-tard about 10 minutes, including interruptions. Other manufacturers should take lessons from this one! It is just the right size - not skimpy like others I have seen. My 2 1/2 year old Grandbaby is very pleased with the cradle, and so is her Grandma."
4,B-Day present for 3 year old,"Well, after looking around at lots and lots various baby doll cribs and cradles, both kits and prebuilt (much more $$$) this was the one, it was extremely easy to assemble and looked great when it was done. Just remember that this is not a highly detailed or super quality product, but it works very well..I put this, and a baby doll high chai,r together for my lil' grandaughter for her 3rd birthday, she really liked it. Right away she packed all of her dollies and stuffed toys into it and covered them up, so...it worked well."
5,Perfect for a 2 year old,"This was so easy to put together and it is very good quality, very sturdy. The pillow is really not a pillow, just a flat piece of fabric but by taking it apart and adding some ""stuffing"" it is fine."
1,avoid like the plague,Magazine is fine but it didn't come for 6 months after ordering. Amazon blamed 3rd parties and wouldn't help. We will never order mags through Amazon.
1,Terrible service from Amazon,"Nothing against the magazine itself, but getting your hands on the first issue is a whole different story! First off it is late (in fact I still don't have my first issue) - But that is not the worst part. The worst part is the post-purchase service you get from Amazon. First, people who answered the phone number provided in confirmation e-mail from Amazon, did not find/know anything about the confirmation number Amazon had e-mailed me. Well, guess what, that's all I have folks! unless you want me to make one up, I don't have any other confirmation numbers!Insisting a bit more, frusterated the lady answering the phone and she told me that she did not work for Amazon and what do I want from her?!!So, imagine this, the publication you paid for, never arrived, the confirmation number Amazon sent you does not exist and the phone number provided by Amazon says they don't work for Amazon?! That is what I call service!!"
5,Put some flair into your home!,"Ever since my summer trip to Italy, I have been gathering some Italian home magazines because I noticed that they feature more realistic homes than American magazines which often feature stately homes. I use Casa Viva to get design ideas and tips on high quality home items that I can sometimes buy online. And since I understand Italian, I can say that the articles are well-written too."
3,not your first bongo book,"This book presents about twenty rhythms for bongos, but in a very concise manner and the classical musical notation which does not show which types of strokes are used - you have to figure out the fingering yourself. This book is not an instructional material - I guess it is meant for intermediate bongo player as a reference to quickly look up basics of rhytms he is less used to.However, this is a reprint of rather old material and does not include newer developments in latin music such as the songo.In my opinion, beginners would be far better off by paying slightly more for the ""Bongo Book"" by T.Salloum which also includes a CD of examples, or his second volume ""Beyond Basics"" which also features playalong tracks."
1,not for beginners - intimidating & over-priced,"not for the faint-of-heart. way over-priced: 16 2-sided pages plus front and back cover, about an 1/8 of an inch thick for $10.95?printing/layout looks pretty amateurish.Alfred Publishing puts out a LOT of great instructional material for all kinds of instruments. They missed the boat with ""Bongo Rhythms""; it does not compare favorably with their other material.I am a music instructor of several instruments, including beginning and intermediate snare and drumset. Reading printed rhythms is nothing new to me - this material would scare the bejeebers out of a beginner or early intermediate musician working on their own.Unless you are an advanced reader of rhythms, or have an advanced player/instructor working closely with you, my guess is you'd find this very frustrating to work with."
3,Ok resource.,"This book is an OK resource if you are looking for something a little better than basic, but not too advanced. I liked that it was availble for my Kindle which is why I bought it. The book takes up a lot of space explaining the roots of the rhythms( a little too much in my opinion), but it does a good job of showing them written down. Just be aware that you will be getting a lot of the history of the rhythms. Overall, a good learning tool for anyone looking for a bongo specific book as there are not very many of those out there it seems."
4,Beginners to Advanced,The compilation of rythms by Evans is displayed in a clear and appropriate manner. The rythms are suitable to both an advanced and the aspiring bongo drummer. An excellent set of skills to add to your repetoir!
4,A good start,"This book is simplifying a lot the basic understanding of FCP 4, and is very easy to go through. But there's no in-depth explanation of what the functions are. Nothing in details about capturing and exporting. No real explanation on how the files outside FCP are being handled, and what kind of space it will take on your hard drive.Obviously this book is good to read if you've never touched FCP. In a week you will go through it. You don't even need to do the exercises, as the book shows you every single menu and has visual representations of all the functions it's taking you through. And in this way this book is worth having.But going through it I thought I was missing a lot of technical details, which is hopefully covered in the advanced version."
1,Do not buy this item,"I purchased this item based on my experience with a similar product of lower capacity from Imation. This product is in no way similar to the previous one or the one described on this page. The rotating and ""push to lock cap"" on the older model was a big plus. This one does not function that way, it just rotates to leave a big gap over the connector, so there is functionally no cap at all! The ""write protect"" slide descibed above and present in the older model is gone. And it is twice as slow as similar products of the same capacity I routinely use. Save your money; this is no bargain at any price."
2,"ATT Corded Phone Good Value, Poor Performance","I would not suggest this product. I should remember that you get what you pay for.....the low price equals the low quality. When one talks on the phone, it sounds like you are in a tunnel. The phone has great features, however, that is nullified when you talk on it."
2,Poor quality speakerphone,The speakerphone cuts in and out and is difficult to hear. I'm probably going to send it back when I find a better substitute.
2,Caller ID doesn't work consistently,"I was looking for a basic phone with caller ID. No frills, little excitement. The phone works fine, but the caller ID will only recognize the incoming calls about half or two-thirds of the time. My other phone will quickly make the identification, so I suspect that it reflects the quality of this unit's caller ID feature. Otherwise, it is easy to use, has all of the basic features, and a well functioning speaker phone."
1,Not very good quality.,"PROS: Compared with other phones on the market that I have used, none really.CONS: This phone requires 4 AA batteries, which it used up in a couple of months, and there is no option for an AC adapter. The call list feature does not scroll in a way that is either intuitive or logical (I haven't tested any of the other features that I normally wouldn't use).Summary: This phone is probably not worth the price. In general, most AT&T; phone products that I've purchased over the past several years proved to be of low quality, breaking within several months. I've had much better experience with VTech phones, which tend to go for a lower price then AT&T.;Thank you Amazon for correctly identifying this as an AT&T; product (it was previously listed as VTech)."
2,ATT CORDED PHONE,WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS PHONE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD BUY. I AN A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN IT'S FUNCTION. THE INFORMATION DOES NOT LIGHT UP AS A CALL IS COMMING THROUGH LIKE IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE. I HAVE ADJUSTED IT A FEW TIMES AND IT CAN'T BE READ IN THE DARK. THE PHONE IS NICE BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMEND IT.
5,I love my phone,I love the sound and all the features' And i can turn the sound up. thankyouDanny Illig
3,Good but not great!,"I purchased this phone for my elderly mother because she has difficulty with cordless telephones given her Parkinson's disease. While it has been easy for her to make and receive calls, the retrieval of voicemail has been difficult because of the poor design of the button. Most answering machines require one to press the flashing button to retrieve voicemail. With this telephone, the flashing button turns the answering machine off. You have to depress the outer portion of the button to retrieve voicemail. Too many times my mother has turned the voicemail off accidentally. This is designed poorly and makes me caution potential buyers of this product."
5,works great,"I bought this phone for 4 days online class (audio portion was via phone). I was a bit worried that 4 AA battries won't last long. I was wrong. 4 AA batteries lasted the whole time (4 days x 8 hours = 32 hours) and did not look like I need to replace them at all.The speaker was very loud and easy to hear, I was talking a bit as well and nobody complained about the quality. Please note I was sitting at my desk with the phone 2-4 feet away. I could clearly hear the speaker from 30 feet away, I did not try to speak from that distance.This is cheap corded phone with speakerphone and does exactly what I expected."
1,DOA,"Phone arrived dead. Tried different batteries, handsets and wall jacks and phone cords. Nothing worked. No dial tone at any time."
1,piece of junk,"this phone is very flimsy and will not last you more then several at best, its a cheap plastic, feels more like a toy."
2,LCD Display Fails After A Year,"I've had at least four of these phones over the past six years or so. Bought the first two for $40 each retail. I like the features and the size. Sadly, the LCD display failed after a year, which makes the memory feature useless as well, because you can't scroll through the memory. Couldn't believe an AT&T; Product would consistently fail after a year.My phone rings all day = mostly telemarketers. So, caller ID for me is a must. I've resorted to purchasing stand-alone caller ID units to attach to the failed phones, but their displays, too, fail after a while.Yet, again, I need several new phones w/caller ID. This time I bought a 2 refurbished Unidens off ebay. If I'm forced to replace phones every year, they're not worth more than $13 each to me.Wish these companies would quit making their electronics in China and bring the manufacturing back to the US. And BUILD STUFF TO LAST.."
2,Operates poorly,At first look the phone was impressive. Having used for three weeks it was necessary to return due to poor performance. The speakerphone is terrible. The numbers in the directory don't dial properly. There are better choices.
1,Keep Looking,"It had all the features I wanted in a gift. The phone looked good when he opened it and he liked all the features it offered. I'm embarrassed to have given it as a gift now knowing the poor working quality of the phone. It sounds ok when using the handset, but the sound quality is awful when used as a speakerphone. The appeal of this product was the speakerphone feature and it does not work as needed. The voice of the person using the phone cuts in and out during the conversation or the person must yell and stand close to the phone in order to be heard. This is not acceptable. The speaker is located on the bottom of the unit. How can you possibly have a good quality speakerphone with the speaker located on the side that faces the surface on which it sits? Keep looking for a better speakerphone product. I know I will!"
2,"Fine, but LCD goes bad","I've had two of these phones. They are good for the price, but the LCD eventually goes bad and displays hieroglyphics. This has happened with both phones within a year. beware - you get what you pay for."
2,Very poor speakerphone quality,"I bought this phone primarily for its speakerphone and it is very disappointing. The sound cuts in and out constantly. The rest of the phone functions are just fine, but if speakerphone is necessary for you, don't get this phone."
3,Settling,It's a handsome unit and doesn't take up much space on my desk. The 12 foot cord I prefer to use causes the handset to slip out of the cradle because the handset is too light. To remedy this I wrap the cord around the base of the phone for leverage; it's not compatible with the longer cord. The speaker is quality is poor. When employed I have difficulty hearing callers and they have difficulty hearing me. There's feedback when I increase the volume.
1,Wuld be nice if it worked,"Phone looks good and sounds good on the handset, but the speakerphone feature is completely worthless. I can't even get a sentence out without people complaining that the sound is cutting out. Should be fine if you don't need a speakerphone - but if you do, don't buy this one."
4,I like it,Like the phone but gonna get a longer cord so i can talk while on the computer. And very very fast delivery also.
5,AWESOME!,This is a great album! One of the best album's I own. Mi Negra is a super cool song. Love Kad Achouri's music and look forward to Societe AND more!
1,Just buy it at the store,"The popcorn arrived stale and we had to request a refund, which the company promptly provided. We ended up buying a similar one (without the winter pattern on the tin) for about 1/10 of the price in the store.I'd consider purchasing other items from this company but would certainly price shop in advance."
5,grate product.,"I decide to give it a 5 star because it sounds grate, considered it is a used item, it sound as good as new.The cover and jewl case not that good but i can replace the jewll case and the lable it is not that important to me.i would recomend this product to any music lovers, it is a good CD with quality songs."
4,"So far, so good","We've had the scale for about 3 weeks now, and it seems to perform mostly as advertised. Weights seem to be pretty consistent, and independent of surface flatness or how the weight is applied. I didn't expect to have to tap the scale each time to activate it and zero it out. I also didn't expect the displayed weight to disappear quite so quickly."
3,"great size, too bad I can't use it for its intended purpose","I bought this to go in my bag (essentially my office) and to use when I park the laptop at home. At home I have an external lacie hard drive for backups and an apple DVD for my macbook air. Theoretically I should be able to plug both in to say, boot off of the DVD and restore from a backup, but even with an external power supply (variable voltage brick from radioshack) powering it, it refuses to work with the DVD. That was kinda the whole point. So, now I can use it for all my other stuff, just not when I have an emergency and really really need it to work."
4,better at overview than technical,"This has good high level explanations of many data storage techniques and technologies, but lacks in the low level blood and guts. I was hoping to see a few more charts or formulas or tables. Then again, it does list where to find white papers that it refers to at the end of each chapter, which is a nice thing."
2,Morning Blend - too lite,"If you like a bold or slightly bold cup, then forget about this blend. I am to used to drinking espresso at home. I have a Keuring at work and I have been trying various k-cups. I will stick with what I've liked in the past; Timonthy's espresso blend and black magic. If I do try other stuff, it will be dark. FWIW one of my co-worker's likes the Morning blend."
3,Timothy's K-Cup Coffee,"Love the coffee, but have had too many wasted K-cups where the filter breaks on this brand and my coffee is full of grounds. Never a problem with other brands, but many failures on Timothy's - so I stopped buying this brand."
4,Great Morning Blend,"I thought Timothy's Morning Blend was one of the better ""morning coffees"" that I've tried in the K-Cups. I was not too too bold, but gave me the pick up I needed to begin the day. Recommend!"
2,Kind of weak and pods break,"I have a kuerig coffe maker and started ordering pods from Amazon because I didn't have to order 10 cases like other places to get free shipping. However, many of the Timothy's brand cups that I ordered from Amazon have burst in the coffee brewer. Which is a pain, because not only is the coffee expensvie and 40 cents a pod, when it breaks it gunks up the coffee maker and has to be taken apart and cleaned. I have not had it happen with any other brand, like Paul Newmans or Emeril's ...once or twice with Green Mountain. So I am disppointed with Timothys quality control. The coffee Morning Blend is one of the weaker cups also, even though it says extra bold."
4,TIMOTHYS WORLD COFFEE-MORNING BLEND,"TIMOTHYS, MORNING BLEND, HAS A PERFECT BALANCE-NOT TO STRONG AND NOT WEAK. A GOOD ADDITION TO YOUR MORNING COFFEE COLLECTION."
1,THIS IS COFFEE ????????,THIS STUFF IS THE WEAKEST K-CUP BLEND EVER NO TASTE NO SMELL NO NOTHING IF YOU LIKE THE COFFE YOU GET AT THE LOCAL EXON STATION (you know the stuff thats three days old burnt and smells of the five day old hotdog next to it) YOU'LL LOVE THIS BREW . DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY GET THE STRONGER BLENDS AND SAY THE $20.00 YOU'LL SPEND ON THIS STUFF
2,Doesn't deliver what the title implies,"I thought this book would be about how to adapt existing plots to one's own needs. Not so. It's an extended list of the basic motivators that can move a story's action, plus a rehash of well-known plots. I really don't need a detailed synopsis of Moby-Dick. Read the book, saw the movie. This is an articulate book that never quite gets to the point."
2,"Huh, disappointed","I really don't understand why this book is so well known. Maybe it's the title. There are better guides to plot structure -- I think this book is actually very light on particulars. It doesn't even particularly help you with plot analysis, though it does provide some examples of how to read another book and pull out the plot.The writing isn't very engaging, either. Overall mediocre."
3,Its more or less fine mathimatics book for BME students,Its book is interested me as a BME teacher; I found its useful but some time very easy and containing some very DUMMY things such as quadratic equation solution; its best for the firest year BME students with medical background;
1,Free Money,Title is very mis-leading..grants only apply if you live in certain states. If you need money why would you spend money for a book that does apply to you...waste of money..
3,Good for some,"There is some good information in this book. Alot of the sources come from the north, although if you take note, you will find some info useful. It is out of date for some references."
1,Read BEFORE Buying,"Yes, I know the book was printed almost 10 years ago, but what was printed then was as big of a waste of time then as it is now. I can kick myself for not reading the reviews before spending my money.Her other book, ""Complete Guide to Getting a Grant"" is far more useful."
1,"Very, very disappointed","Book was listed as very good condition. When I received it, it was mildewed and water-stained throughout. It was disgusting and stunk to high heaven.I would never knowingly buy anything else from this seller again.Cannot be trusted."
4,TDK CD-R Discs,"Reordered second bundle and havn't had a problem yet. Very satisfied, and will do again next time. Good price, good service."
5,Excellent CD-Rs,"I'm not going to pretend I'm a CD-R connoisseur, so I'll just say that these CD-Rs are really good. I've used a good amount of CD-Rs, but these ones feel like top-quality ones."
4,CD,"Excellent quality of CDs. I always wanted to carry a set of mp3 CDs for my car. Unfortuately, most of the cables in the market for aux input as good quality of sound as a CD. Among all CD brands, I found this one with the best price and excellent quality. Excellent buy for the price offered."
5,Great cdr,"Burns fast on my plextor 24x and even faster on my plextor news 40x usb 2.0 , Only 1 coaster ever and thats because I was running 3d studio max , Tdk I trust"
1,Junk,"I've tried burning numerous things on these discs and I've wasted numerous hours having to ""quality check"" them. Not a single one of the 15 discs I've used have burned successfully enough to play all the way through. I've checked them on my mac. Won't play. Checked them on my car stereo. Won't play. Checked them on my home stereo player. Won't play. Absolute garbage and the window of my return has expired. I'm throwing the remaining ones away and starting over with a new brand. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"
5,High Quality from TDK!,"I stand by TDK as the best CD-R media to purchase. I could not find it in stores so I turned to Amazon - product is well packaged and works wonderfully. I found with other brands I had higher incidences of ""bad discs"" that did not play or complete burning correctly, TDK has none of these issues. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Very Reliable,I find less waste with TDK than with any other brand. Sound is of great quality. I will certainly buy more when needed. I usually by the 100 pak but they were out this time.
1,The worst CD-R I have ever used.,"These are branded as ""data"" CD's, but they are completely useless for backups and data storage. The data CD's that actually appeared to burn successfully (only after I lost 25% of the blanks due to an I/O error I've never had with any other brand) aren't even readable by any machine I've tried them on. Do not rely on these for data storage - the files will appear to be intact, but the data will be garbage."
3,Simple and clean pattern on surface,"I love this because the surface design of TDK is clean and simple: it is much easier to manipulate your labeling or artworks without much headaches (if you choose using CD labeling printouts). Some CDs have a color or dark design surface that give you trouble if you label things carefully with lots of remarks. Many times those dark surface design can come through too when you use the CD labeling over it, not so good. CDRWs, CDRs, DVDs of TDK I have have an empty surface with light grey line and tiny clean dots pattern on it, FYI.When you buy blank CDs you get to do something to label it. I don't have much trouble with TDK blank medias so far, burning-wise or data loss. However, if you don't label much on your media surface, then it does not much matter what it is besides reliablity and price I think, should you consider other big brands. I try to migrate all CD data to DVDs, for fear of data loss and technology shifts over times, for better or for worse."
3,Wanted MUSIC specific CDs,"My fault, I guess. I didn't know the code for TDK music specific discs, so I was disappointed. They are still usable, but I wish I had checked into the product more judiciously."
4,easily read,good book - very interesting - some ideas are outdated but the story makes you want to cash in the retirement and buy a small place on 10 acres
4,This is a great book about preparedness and self sufficiency,"This is a fantastic book about self sufficiency. The only knock is it is dated. But it was written over 150 years ago. It has some interesting information about the economy from the past that you dont hear alot about too. It helps feel better about these bad times we live in now. It shows it wont last forever. Did you know that even during the great depression they had previous bad times to look to. Believe it or not each generation is not the first ot suffer, nor will they be the last. Good times will come again. And what we learn during the bad times determines the success we will have when times are good. This book teaches more than just farming, though that is the featured aspect. IT was an enjoyable read. I would love to have a modern author do a similar expirament adn write adn updated version. Maybe that book will still sell for 200 years."
2,disappointing,"First off, the product looked great and came promptly and was priced well. The wall charger works well, but unfortunately that's where the good news ends.The car charger works, except that the first time I tried to unplug my phone from it, the tip of the charger came apart (wires dangling and all) and I had to grab some needle-nose pliers to unplug it all. Some epoxy helped keep it together but it came apart again recently so I'll add more glue this time around.The data cable does not work at all. I have a real Samsung cable and bought this USB cable in the hopes of keeping a spare for my office (and leave the other at home). It doesn't charge, does not sync up, so basically I can't use it for anything ... it was a disappointing experience overall.I've rated it as 2 stars because I might have gotten a bad batch, and at least 1 of the 3 items worked out of the box."
5,I love this book.,"I love this book. It has a bunch of short little statements that keep you grounded as a parent, reminding you of what your parental role is really all about. I would recommend it to every parent or give it as a gift."
1,Not wood,"This was a big let down. Ours was wobbling within a week and completely broke in a month. I don't know what the material it is made out of, but it almost seemed like compressed chipboard with paint. For a simple gift, buy it... For an heirloom, steer clear."
4,good value doll cradle,"Cute cradle, easy to put together, pad and pillow a little on the skimpy side but otherwise a good value"
2,Just a little disappointed,"I am overall happy with the purchase. The only thing that was a BIG disappointment was the fact that the base of the cradle is made of flimsy board, not solid wood like the rest of the cradle. I wish all of it was solid wood so the durability would have been improved, hopefully when it does break (because it will) my husband will be able to make a thin solid wood piece to replace it."
1,It's about time to move into the new milennium,"This book is a boring, humorless and extremely dated rant. It's painfully obvious that the authors are stuck in the groovy, bra-burning 70s. They've supposedly updated it, though you'd never know it. It's really time to take off the mood rings and the aviator frames, gals."
5,5 star read,"I was fasinated by this beautiful story. However, most of the book is about the geisha's make-up, hairstyles, and clothing. I think guys would find this book very boring. If you're a girl, though, definitly check it out. The movie is worth seeing, but it doesnt really go into depth about anything so to really appreciate it, you need to have read the book."
3,korean or japanese?,"I'm totally confused about this film. Half the movie is in Japanese and the other half is korean. I'm japanese so i could understand half of it? hehe. Well compared to some of the japanese film releases in the united states, I must say, at least this film is more recent.For a Yakuza movie, I will admit that its a little thin on realism. This is definitely more of a korean dipiction of the japanese mob.Having said that, the girls are so attractive it makes up for the lack of realism. Most asian movie buffs buy films for action, or the girls. This one is definitely a pick for the girls.Unlike HK movies, there is more depth and death.I would give this 3 stars."
3,OK not as great as other WS videos,Heres the scoop First buy the 96 video That is one of the best world series videos ever. Then buy 99. 96 is ten million times more dramatic it puts you in the action. The 98 and 99 versions are just really highlites like on SportsCenter
5,encore!!!!,The Yankees did a good follow up with this victory in 1999. The best games were 1 and 4. I was at 3 and 4.
4,Pixelblocks,"Purchased this toy for an older child who has lots of creative fun with it. You are able to make 3 dementional shapes with this, which makes for alot of fun. I would not recommend this toy for younger children because the pieces are small and easy to put in their mouth. Lots of fun for older kids that like to create things."
4,Used in the pool,"My pool doesn't have steps & my Golden, unlike my lab, won't jump into the pool. I bought this ramp plus ""legs"" and put it in my pool so my Golden could walk down the ramp into the pool. He learned to use it immediately. My only comment is it's not stable & I have to hold onto it as my dog walks down it. Again - this is in the pool. I can't comment on how it is on solid ground. It did solve my problem, however. My Golden can now enjoy the pool with me & my lab."
1,Not Impressed,"I really should have paid closer attention to the negative feedback that this product was given. I purchased these sheets for $60 because they were featured on Amazon's ""Today's Deals"" and I thought I was getting a steal of a deal. What I actually got was basically a one-use disposable sheet set. They fit loose on the bed before washing them, they shrink in the wash, but do so to the point that they rip when you put them back on the bed. This I attribute to weak stitching at the seams. The smooth finish that they initally have coming out of the package is lost on the first wash also, and a woman's mascara is all that it takes to permanently stain them. I don't really care if my sheets wrinkle coming out of the dryer, which they did, but I do expect them to hold up to normal use. I am very surprised that a product of such poor quality is listed on such a good online shopping site."
2,I would not recommend,it says 1000 thread but I have 500 & 600 threats way softer than these that cost less.
2,Hard to beleive its 1000TC,There weren't many options for 1000TC single ply sheets under $100 so I thought I'd give these a try. I knew based on reviews that they were going to wrinkle easily and felt I could live with that. The problem I have is that these are horrible for 1000TC. I've had sheets that were 500 or 600 TC that felt better than these. I followed the washing and drying instructions. Its been 3 months since I've had them and they haven't gotten any softer. They feel more like 300TC.
4,A good deal,"My sheets just arrived and are being washed now. They seem like a good quality for the price. They're thick but smooth and don't feel like canvas, like other 1000 TC sheets I've purchased.Incidentally, when I tossed them in the washing machine I noticed that the tag on the sheets labels them as part of the JC Penny Home Collection, in the Chris Madden line. Right now they're selling for $119.99 for the queen set (which is supposedly a marked down price) on the JCP web site. They're substantially less than that here, so I feel like I got a good deal."
5,"Pike Street 1,000 thread count sheets","Wow! Was this a deal. For $54.99, I felt like I was stealing these unbelievable 1,000 thread count queen sheets! Unlike lesser count sheets I have purchased (for much more, I might add!), the fitted sheet actually fit my oversize pillowtop mattress. The flat sheet completely covered my mattress from top to bottom with plenty of room to tuck between the mattress and box springs. The pillow cases were large enough to contain my overstuffed down pillows. The cotton is soft yet the material is somewhat ""crisp"" so it feels like the very expensive linens I've experience at ""upper crust"" hotels. I've only washed this set once, so it will be interesting to see if the pieces shrink, how long they last and if they stay wrinkle-free out of the dryer. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will be buying more for all of my beds!"
3,HEAVY SHEETS,"I COULD NOT IMAGINE SUCH A WEIGHTY PACKAGE CONTAINING EGYPTIAN COTTON SHEETS! I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED 1000 COUNT WOULD BE HEAVY. THE FLAT SHEET IS ALSO OVERSIZE FOR A QUEEN MATTRESS BUT THE FITTED SHEET AND PILLOWCASES FIT WELL.THE SHEETS ARE WELL MADE BUT DO NOT FEEL SILKY AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED IN EGYPTIAN COTTON. (I MUST HAVE MISSED THE WORD ""LINEN""."
2,Do Not Buy,"These sheets are very course (heavy fabric). Out of the package, they were great but after washing, the sheets shrank to the point they barely fit my mattress. They also come out of the wash very wrinkle. After the second wash, the sheets shrank further. The top sheet is now too short to tuck under the foot of the mattress. I will NOT recommend these sheets to anyone. I certainly will not purchase again."
5,Great Sheets!,"I had two sets of sheets from 1998. This year they BOTH got a hole in the same exact spot. So I went in search of a nice replacement. These sheets are WONDERFUL. I have been following the recommended washing instructions and they work very well. I was scared when they first arrived, I forgot to check if they would work on my thick mattress, and was pleasantly surprised that they were made for deep mattresses! All in all, I'm really pleased. NOte: I do not iron my sheets, I don't mind a few wrinkles."
1,my pike street were a waste of money.,"to be honest, I don't have this particular sheet set, but I bought several other pike street sheets from amazon, and every one of them pilled up, or fell apart the very first time I used them. plus, they smell chemically out of the washer.it's also, not possible to get true 1200 thread count sheets, (meaning, a single thread woven against a single thread) these people claiming ""mine is bigger"" thread counts are weaving multipe smaller fibers together, like tiny little ropes, and weaving those... they're not nearly as durable, and don't feel as good.save your money in the end, and get some Costco Kirkland true 600 thread count sheets, they may be a bit more expensive, but they last, and last, and last, and, they feel, and smell better."
3,Sheets,"These sheets have a great color and feel pretty nice. I really wanted quality Egyptian workmanship, but these are made in China. My other complaint is that they do not quite fit over the bottom of my mattress as the product description implied."
2,Not so soft Egyptian Cotton,I was disappointed with this purchase. This Egyptian cotton sheet set is not as soft as others that I have touched while in Egypt. But I noticed that these were made in China not in Egypt.
1,Horrible,"Do not even waste your time placing an order for these. They shrink, the corner seam came out first washing, and they are pretty soft if you like cardboard. What a rip off! I expected more from an Amazon merchant."
1,"They're fleece, not 1000 thread Egyptian cotton.","I received the sheets, the sticker PURPLE FLEECE MADE IN CHINA was covered by another sticker that read: PIKE STREET 1000 THREAD EGYPTIAN COTTON."
2,No more than average sheets here.,These sheets are not as silky and shoft as many other high tc I have bought. They will be fine for the spare bed when you have company over but don't want them to stay too long. If they didn't say 1000tc I wouldn't believe it. they feel much more like 400 tc.
3,Could be better!,"The sheets are not as soft as I had expected, and they need pressing when they come out of the dryer. For the money, I expected better quality."
3,Should be better!,I expected better quality from such high count sheets. They do not really feel much different than sheets with much less count. They are wrinkled out of dryer and that urks me. I cannot comment on durability as I have only used them twice so far.
4,"Nice sheets, Nice Price..","I have never owned 1000TC sheets before so I did not know what to expect. I had heard though that the higher the TC the softer & finer the sheet. But even after the first wash I found these a bit stiff & wrinkly. Not an issue though. The wrinkles come out once on the bed and I like the weight though I am hoping they will soften up a bit as I wash them more. Otherwise they are quite comfortable & I love the richness of the Plum colour. The depth of the pocket in the fitted sheet and the elastic all around its hem really hugged my Q.size mattress and didn't slip or bunch. I was disappointed in a couple of things though. (1) I would have liked the flat sheet to be a bit more generous in width and length. At least 10"" each way would have been sufficient. (2) Also the pillowcases were a bit short; about 3-4"" longer & they would have looked & fit the pillow much better."
5,"Great sheets, funky color","The sheets are very nice to sleep in. They are not stiff and while not silky they are smooth on the skin. Many of our other high count sheets are thick, these definitely are not thin but they do not feel heavy on you like some of the others can be. They also feel very sturdy and I have no reason to feel they will not last for years.Color is a hard thing to describe. The ""Sage"" is more vibrant than the picture of them show more like an actual green olive. We have enough white sheets and wanted more color for the room. We certainly got that. While we do not exactly love the color we do really like the sheets."
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought these sheets thinking I was getting a good deal. I should have read the reviews first. My mistake. These sheets are thick which I guess might be good in the long run. However my husband and I both thought they were scratchy and not the quality we were expecting. My Target 600tc are way better and softer than these. I am still holding out hope that the ""egyptian cotton"" will start softening soon. Though I am skeptical that there is even egyptian cotton in them since all the tag and packaging says is cotton. All of my other egyptian cotton sheets and towels actually say egyptian cotton.If I hadnt already washed these, I would DEFINITELY be returning them."
2,"Choose the other ""Pike Sheet 1000TC""","It is very important to note that these are much different (in both quality and size) that the other ""Pike Street 1000 Thread Count"" sets available on a different page (same price range, but says ""Single-Ply Sateen"" rather than ""Eqyptian"").The ""Single Ply"" feel twice as substantial as these ""Egyptian"", and weigh more (almost 1 pound heavier in weight). In addition, the Queen flat sheets for ""Single-Ply"" measure 93 x 101 (92 x 102 is supposed to be Queen standard), whereas these 'Egyptian' measure only 88 x 98.Have owned at least 4 other brands of 1000TC sheets."
2,wrinkles,"If you like wrinkles, you will love these sheets. You can't get them out of the dryer and onto the bed quickly enough to avoid the wrinkles. And be careful, I thought I was ordering the king sheet set but got the queen instead, a glitch, maybe my fault, but definitely related to the way the order is set up. These sheets are a high thread count, which I wanted, but they feel average at best. There is nothing special about them."
1,Don't buy these!,"Did not last, fitted sheet tore on corner after 6 months, not soft at all, might as well been 100 thread count"
2,Too much of a good thing,"I bought these sheets because of the great price and the high thread count. They are very sturdy and thick. In fact, so thick that they are stiff and rough, even after several washings with extra softener. They are very heavy as well, so not very good for hot weather sleeping."
4,Super smooth sheets,Sheets are cool and a lovely color - they smooth onto the bed and are completely satisfactory.
2,What are they thinking?,"Don't be fooled by the claim that the fitted sheet will fit an 18"" deep mattress. The corners just make it around my 16"" mattress. There isn't enough fabric for the sheet to be completely around the mattress. Wash only in cold water or you will be left with a sheet that is too small. What is up with sheet manufacturers today?On the positive side, I like the heavy feel of the fabric. It feels substantial, not flimsy."
3,Somewhat disappointed,I was excited when I saw 1000 thread count until I received the box. Nowhere on the packaging did it even state this is Egyptian cotton. It is a 1000 thread count sheets mass produced in China. I have some 600 thread count sheet I picked up at Target that feel better than these. Not bad but not what I expected.
4,SO SOFT,Some people wrote in there reviews that these were soft sheets yet wrinkle. The soft comments sold me and I ordered them. I did wash and dry them prior to putting them on the bed (with fabric softener) They were SO SOFT to sleep on. Much better than any thing I have had before. As for those wrinkles...well if I'm not doing things in bed to wrinkle them than I need to find things to wrinkle them! A great buy.
3,Average,These sheets are average. My wife and I had 1000 ct sheets prior to these and used them everyday for 7 years. They ripped at the seem and we decided on these. They do not compare. They do fit our 18 inch mattress nicely though.
2,Disappointed-must be a knock-off,"These supposedly 1000ct sheets are no softer than the 250s I've purchased at Target. The label in the package only said Pike Street, nothing else. I think these are a knock-off. Don't buy them!"
2,Not as expected,"For 1000 TC, Egyptian Cotton, Single ply sheets I was expecting heaven! However, these were more like cardboard at first touch. They weren't thick, or soft, and the construction seemed questionable. Not sure about the fit or if these softened up after washing since these were purchased as a present. According to the other reviews it seemed like this product is hit or miss. I guess my set purchased was a miss and I probably will not purchase this brand again even if the price is what made this purchase so attractive. So,1 star for price and 1 star for ship time."
2,Two totally different qualities,"I ordered this in both a queen and a king. The queen arrived first, and it felt okay, not quite as good as my 700 ct from before. Then about a week later my king arrived, and it felt about as good as sleeping on cardboard. I was upset because they were totally different name brands (the queen was something balloon?) and the kings were Ralph Lauren. I am shocked that Ralph Lauren would sell something under their name that poor of quality. I called Amazon and they promptly sent me a new King set and unfortunately it was exactly the same, so I'm sad, but figure for $50.00 I'll just deal with it...we'll have to find something good locally and be able to test it first, you just can't tell what you're stepping into sometimes online."
4,A tale of a planet separated into two distinct hemispheres.,"One is bathed in eternal sunlight, the other sidein perpetual darkness. On the sun-baked side, welearn of princess Vel Thaidis, who is victimizedby the conniving prince Ceerdres. On the planet'sdark side, snobbish, melodramatic princess Vitraseemingly creates the story of Vel Thaidis via""fabulism"", a television-like technology used toappease the lower classes. She is in love with thekind and charitable prince Casrus. The earlychapters of this book play like a SF-obsessedromance novel and are rather weak, and the ""parallelworlds"" setup seems a bit gimmicky to start with.Stick with it, though, as when we learn the fatesof Vel Thaidis and Casrus, the book improvesimmesurably. The latter half of the book is highlyengrossing, and while the twist ending seems a littlecontrived, it is still a worthwhile read. Probablynot recommended for a first taste of Tanith Lee,but if you have already read and enjoy her work,try this one."
4,"Well, that was fun!","Talk about playing with polarity! This was quite an inventive soap opera. Like the other reviewer who kindly furnished the synopsis for us, I was just a tad disappointed with the ending; it seemed just a little too conceptually lazy. But it was certainly fun!"
2,Disappointing read,"Tantalizing book cover and promising introduction but the rest of the book was very disappointing. While the author's writing style is fluid, the disjointed tales of her experiences lack coherency and fail to reconnect to the title theme. To the reader, the author doesn't seem to have found ""enlightenment"" as claimed, but a recycling of experiences, and we are left quite disappointed."
2,Not as advertised,"By the cover and the title, the publisher of this book is using sex to sell it. However it is barely about Tantra at all. It is the author's journey of ""who am I"". It is all over the place and most of the time I could not tell what the heck she was talking about, or to whom she was referring. She is very coy about anything sexual. She needed a good editor to get her to focus, but focus, she does not. Don't waste your time unless you like reading someones's journal (who knows people are reading it and therefore leaves out anything private)."
2,Good story but sloppy writing,"Tantrika is one woman's journey to India and Pakistan is search of spirituality and discovery of her roots. Along the way she meets many characters, some warm and wonderful some a bit shady. The journey ends suddenly and you are left wondering what it all meant. The story is interesting never the less, even though the writing is sloppy and the story goes all over the place. The book feel more like a random brain dump that a coherent story. The personal and political are interwoven aimlessly."
4,WHEN I WAS A GERMAN,"Until I read this book I never realized there were British (and American) women who had married Germans prior to the outbreak of WWII and actually lived in that ""enemy"" country while we were at war with them. The author suffered along with the German cicil population as the allies methodically bombarded Nazi Germany into submission. The constant fear of daily aerial bombings,hunger, and the fear of the Gestapo make this an epic story of survival.Better than fiction!"
3,A little bit obvious suggestions,A little simple but I guess you have to start somewhere. It's a quick read. Aparently me review is 5 words short.
4,An old paperback,This ia a great book/ We had to have it for a college class and it cost less than a dollar. We paid $17.00for this one. Wish we would have kept some of our old books. Glad to have it again.
5,Raven Lightstand,"Nice, well made stand. Folds compactly and operates smoothly. Needed it to replace another brand that clearly wasn't as well-made. Happy with this purchase."
5,carceri reviewed,"yourcenar her usual brilliant self.the actual essay on piranesi contains erratic confusion of the term ""engraving"".an engraving employs a burin(graver).the carceri are etchings(aqua forte in french)and employ acid(dutch mordant or iron of perchloride or a strong solution of nitric).the burin might be emplyed to accenuate shadows(as in some of rembrandts etchings).my impression is that the french term gravure,which includes etching was translated into english as engraving.not quite the same."
5,Favorite book,I remember devouring this book in high school (mid 80s) in one night (two nights at the most). So when I found it again on Amazon I had to get a copy for myself. It was just as good as I remembered.
1,Worst Christmas Gift.,"My son only asked Santa for this toy. The commercial made it look 100X better than it is. The Doc Ock arms don't move well, the doors fall off and Spidey doesn't flip.My son doesn't play with it because it keeps falling apart."
1,Flimsy and frustrating!,"My son got the Spider Man Subway Train set as a Christmas present. It LOOKED like it was going to be a lot of fun... seeing Spider Man hanging around upside-down thanks to magnets was something ALL of my kids was anxious to see. However, the thing continually fell apart, and my kids had a tough time putting it back together so that it stayed together. It was frustrating and definitely not worth it."
5,Entertaining and Thought Provoking,"GK Chesterston's works are engaging and funny. My personal favorite of this collection is Manalive. The fantastic antics of Innocent Smith, the hero of the story, keep the reader entertained. All the author's stories entertain the reader while making a hidden moral or philosophical point.Fun reading for the educated person."
2,Old-school recorder at an old-school price,"I've had this product for about 3 years and it just sits on the shelf. Given all the modern technology out there, this system is pretty ancient. The tape recordings are very noisy. The only useful way I've used this is as a basic two-mic mixer that feeds into the mic jack on my PC. From there I record with Windows Sound Recorder. For the money, it's just not worth it."
1,Same name different product,Geni-Soy is no longer manufacturing this product. IT appears that the name/product has been sold to another company and some of the ingredients are different on the label. I did not try this after receiving it - have donated it and wanted others to know about the change. The label looks nothing like the original.
1,Disgusting,"FYI: The ""Natural flavors"" claimed on the container appear to be ""dust"" and ""all-purpose flour,"" and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never ""mix"" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk."
4,Excellent Review Book,"This is an excellent review book for medical physiology. The only thing that can be difficult with this book is the division of the questions into units instead of chapters. My class does not go by entire units, instead we are assigned certain chapters, so going through and finding the relevant questions can be time consuming. Other than that slight problem, this book has helped me get through many exam questions and has allowed me to really understand the material. A must for anyone who wishes to fully understand medical physiology."
1,might be good with a teacher,"This book has a very bad transcription - no stress marked at all, schwa and a constantly confused. It begins with alphabet, grammar, and a second part with translation exercises. It has much interesting vocabulary, mostly military; it is a book beyond a beginner's level, though including it, it would be one of the best I have seen, except that you just can't learn pronunciation form it."
4,Happened upon the book....,I was staying at a Bed And Breakfast at Rushford MN and found this book laying on the coffee table upstairs. I started reading and couldn't put it down until I was done at 12:30 am. A very fascinating book. I wish he would write more. I still want to know why Nehring asked him if he wanted to sleep with his wife. There are stories waiting to be fleshed out here. Can't wait. Good book.
4,real life mayberry,"This is a short book, and a quick read. The first chapter is worth the book by itself. In it he tells the story of letting his airplane take off by itself, thats a must read. Many of the other stories a good as well, some better than others. If you like Andy Griffeth you will like this book. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Good Cop, Good Cop.","Neil Haugerud's Jailhouse Stories should be mandatory reading at every police academy. If half the police had half of Neil's common sense and compassion, our world would be twice as nice. Neil is a master of understatement and a great storyteller. Read his book and he becomes an old friend, though you've never met. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, Author of WAKE UP DEAD"
3,"very pretty, but a little small","I just love this necklace and wear it almost everyday, I just wish it was a little bigger (not much, just a little) The chain is very light, but that is to be expected, as you are really buying the pendant. I am very pleased with it for the most part and will probably buy the matching earrings as well"
5,The past comes alive in this book!,"Grundy has done what good historical fiction should always do--he has transported the reader back in time. This is the sort of book that makes you feel as if you are inside the novel, not just observing the actions but walking alongside the heros."
5,Not the typical story,This story is much different than an other Holocaust book that I have read. The fact the the girl Ruth survives WWII without being caught is amazing. This book is definitely a look at the other side of the war - the one in hiding and actually surviving. I was touched and surprised. This book is a great alternative to Anne Frank's Dairy.
1,Overkill,"I actually disagree with all of the other reviews -- this book was completely out of line. The REA made me think I would fail while the test was down right easy. The fact of the matter is that the Humanities CLEP does require a wide knowledge base with a basic understanding of art, musical periods, and literature. But the emphasis is on BASIC. For instance, the REA book went into DEPTH about how music is structured, the tone, beats, etc. The test, on the other hand, asked about composers, or opera singers (don't freak out, you could eliminate all the wrong answers by knowing poets, actresses, and novelists) but nothing on how music was structured. Also, the REA was unbalanced: certain sections were longer than others and the section on philosophy was basically just a list of philosophers and barely enough on what they actually said, or who they were connected with. Just don't worth your money or time."
4,pretty decent resource,"I purchased this book a while ago, and I have to say the money was well worth it. The content is fairly organized and easy to follow. As with any CLEP, it is always best to use several resources. Personally, I have been using InstantCert.com for months, and have been really happy with it so far. I've passed 5 CLEPs, and it has been my primary source for study information. It's definitely worth checking out. They even have a money back guarantee in case you aren't satisfied with it!As soon as you're registered, I would also highly recommend to use the forums for exam-specific feedback. Oh yeah, and you can use the coupon code ""66026"" to get $5 off your first month's access fee. Good luck to all my fellow CLEPsters out there!"
3,CLEP Humanities Reveiw,"This is a good book for use as an outline for study, but should definitely be used in conjunction with further research."
2,Made me realize not to take the test,"Although the book was extremely detailed and thorough, it made me realize that it is impossible to prepare for this exam from this book alone."
4,CLEP Humanities w/ CD-ROM (REA) The Best Test Prep for the CLPE (REA Test Preps),It has everything it says it does. Practice tests and study reviews. Worth every penny.
1,Found many mistakes in this book......,"I took the Humanities Clep exam to fulfill some deficiencies for my Master's Degree. The material in this book was totally different than the actual exam. The material in this book is 10x more difficult than the actual exam. I found some mistakes in this book. I feel that this is not a good study guide and the explanations are not well written to the point that they do not really explain the correct answer. Because of this book, I FAILED!!! Some things just did not make any sense."
5,Superb Work By a Superb Man,"Stacey has many talents of the great game of life and believe it or not, they are almost all useful to the Californian Mountainman. His book is very funny it is very hard to put it down when nature calls."
5,"Sumptuous, inspiring look at the work of top embroiderers","This book profiles some of the top embroidery artists in Great Britain today. Along with examples of each artist's work, there are sketchbook pages, often with working drawings for the finished pieces shown, biographies, and interviews. Many of the pieces are densely embroidered, like paintings in thread. All of these artists have strong foundations in drawing, and though some of the work is abstract, much of it is figurative. There are no directions or how-to, but rather a sumptuous feast for the eyes. High quality images. Very inspiring."
5,BBE Sound Maximizer 882i,"I ended up having to send the 482i back because it was the wrong model for my purposes. Amazon Prime did a great job of responding to my needs. I ended up getting the 882i and plugging it in to my PA system. It was simple and easy to do, and what a marvelous difference. The improvement was subtle in a big way. The vocals were clearer and warmer. The guitars stand out in the mix and the overall sound was more ""present"". The physics of the process is explained in their user manual, but my advice is to let your ears do the science, and then you'll get it."
3,watch came without proper documentation/papers,"THe watch looks fine but I was disappointed that it came without ANY paperwork, no manual for how to set it or description of it's features, warranty description, etc. It appears authentic but I assume the lack of associated paperwork is related to the deeply discounted price.Also the band is a bit small for average woman - I wear it on the loosest whole in the leather strap and it is a bit snug."
3,bored th life out of kids,"This book is boring to children, th cover got them all excited but the dull text inside made them uninterested...I was better off explaining it myself."
3,Good Resource,"I elected to skip around a little for my three year old, but found the book to be very informative and sparked questions."
5,"Great book to introduce the topic of ""privacy & bodies""","I read this book with my 6 year old daughter based on other reader reviews. I have to say that is was right on. Any younger, it may have missed the mark. It really addresses who is appropriate to touch or see our bodies. Of course, we talked about what we read, which made it even better."
5,The Best of its Kind I've Read To-Date!,"I ordered 5 sexual abuse prevention books. Among them, this was my favorite. It 1st introduces the topics of privacy, personal space, and saying ""no,"" before delving into more serious topics. Children are most often victimized by a family member, neighbor, or family friend and the book addresses this fact by simply stating that these people in addition to strangers are not allowed to pull your pants down, take nude photos,etc. These scenarios are very real and children need to learn what exactly they're supposed to object to. Other books of the same topic were too general and in essence equate to the familiar theme of ""never talk to strangers"" without going into more depth. I also think this book is a good length and ends on a positive note. The illustrations are black/white, but the text and drawings definitely make up for this. Finally, I recommend it for ages 3-9."
3,Not a preschool book,"After reading the reviews, I ordered this book thinking that it would be appropriate for my 3-year old. It seems too advanced for a child that age. There is a part of the book where the girl does not want her uncle to touch her because he holds her in his lap and rubs her arms and makes her uncomfortable, and another picture where her older brother ""pins her down,"" and tickles her until it hurts, so the father has to tell him to stop. The mother also warns the child that others might want to take pictures of her private parts. While I understand that these are important illustrations of unwanted behavior, they don't seem right for a younger child. The text is also geared toward a school-aged child."
4,Excellent book for imparting strong boundaries to children,"In this message told in the voice of an adolescent girl, children can understand how to view privacy, and how their feelings are important as a guide (to which they should respond.) I use this book in prevention presentations for seven-to-ten-year-olds, and they are well-engaged in the narrative. My only complaint is the uninspiring illustrations; they simply lack color."
2,"desirable features, poor sound reproduction","These Jensen swivel cup headphones are mechanically fine but lacking in sound quality. Male speakers sound as though they are in a large metal drum, echoing excessively. I find this annoying and will look elsewhere for replacement. The right angle plug and inline volume control are a requirement for me and worked well."
3,Sounds Okay; could use some design improvements,"High marks for size and portability. The sound is not bad. We have used this several times to watch movies on our laptop and though definitely not comparable to a nice set of computer speakers, it sounds okay and is a big step up from the built-in laptop speakers.Could use some refinements, like allowing you to slide the cover on when it's plugged in and perhaps storing the cables in the unit instead of in a separate bag."
4,Great product for the size and money.,"These are perfect for traveling. I'm glad it uses AAA batteries so you can use it where there is no outlet, or if you just don't feel like plugging it in. Very small, and great sound considering the size. It gets loud enough to use in a good size hotel room without distorting. Of course it is a little ""tinny,"" but that's what I expected from something so small. If you are using an Ipod, set the EQ to ""small speakers."" That made a big difference for me."
2,confused,From reading the reviews the product weighs 14 oz and is tiny. from reading amazon's specs:12.0 x 14.0 x 10.0 inches ; 4.0 pounds
4,Excellent sounding small speaker,"I've used this speaker mainly for listening to speech from an iPod. However, I've also played music thru it from a Creative Labs MP3 player, and an iPod. A line out feed is definately the best way to go if you have it available.I used this speaker to play music curb-side at a marathon run to encourage the participants. Granted, the runners couldn't hear the music until they were within 10ft of it, but many people actually took a second look at the speaker, and several made comments about the nice sound. (I'm not exaggerating)Pros:Sound is excellent for such a small speaker setup.Long, long battery life, and visual warning for low battery.Auto shutoff feature is great.Cons:Cover constantly sliding closed by itself.A great buy at the Amazon price."
3,I take it everywhere...,Pretty good sound for speakers this small. I use it with a portable satellite radio and take it everywhere. The biggest problem I have with it is that there is no external off switch. In order to turn the speakers off you have to slide the cover closed which requires you to remove the audio in and power cable. It gets annoying.
4,"Great for your hotel room, and much better than your laptop","The OnTour certainly isn't the best-sounding speaker system, but as portable ones go it's pretty good. The sliding top covers it nicely when it's not in use and when open it sits nicely on a desk. The sound is plenty loud to fill a hotel room and it's not as horribly tinny and trebly as many small speakers like this can be. You're certainly not going to mistake it for a dance club, but the sound is good enough that you can enjoy your music without being distracted by bad audio quality. Finally, it also comes with a handy fabric carrying case. After traveling with it for a few months, it still doesn't have any scratches. For the price, this is the best-sounding and most easily-portable speaker system that I've heard."
4,pocket P.A.,This is a nice sounding unit for its size. The one feature I wish it would have had is a built-in rechargable battery unit. Other than that it's compact and ready to rock.
2,"design flaw, No Bass","Cannot close speaker lid when wires are connected. Speakers might be good for light listening, Has little bass which makes rap and hard rock hard to listen to. Speakers sounded like they were tearing apart while listening to Metallica."
3,OK for the price,"Small enough to travel with. I use it with my iBook laptop. The price is right, but it sounds no better than an old fashioned table top radio."
2,JBL on Tour Speakers... never mind,"1. They're cheap enough.2. They have a cute cloth case.3. As others have noted but I did not believe, the lid keeps sliding and tangling with the input wire and the power supply.3. The sound is as light as the weight and as cheap as the price.4. I wasted my not much money."
4,On Tour Speakers,Great little speakers to use with your I-Pod or other MP3. Good shound for a reasonable price.
5,Nice Speakers,These speakers have great sound and travel easily with your laptop. Typical quality JBL product.
2,"Not bad, but not the best","I have bought about 8 different portable speaker systems for my Ipod. This was about the third one I bought, and while it is not a bad systemit is certainly not the best. The king of portable speakers in my humbleopinion is the Virgin BoomTube. When I bought mine they could be had forabout $75. Totally portable and rechargeable, they crank out 40W of powerwith excellent bass. Play time averages about 5 hours on a charge. I playin a garage band every Thursday night and in between jams we hang out bythe fire pit and listen to tunes. The guys in the band have heard all of my different speakers also, and they all agree the BoomTube is king."
2,Too Small,Do not be deceived by the photo this thing is tiny. If that is what you are looking very small low volume very portable I suppose it is ok but over price for what you get. I think $30.00 would have been about right. There is no bass response and for there size how could there be. I am keeping them but only because they are so small they might come in handy for hotel use only! The packaging is very cool but the fidelity is non existent.
5,All About the Sound,"I was debating whether to get the On Tour or the Altec IM3s for travel, so I did a side-by-side listening comparison at the store. In an instant it was ridiculously obvious even to my non-audiophile ears that the On Tour sounded GREAT while the IM3 sounded compressed, distorted, muddy, boomy, and cheap.So I bought the On Tour and was even more impressed when I tested it at home. The sound is very accurate, and I could hear a lot of detail in the music. It doesn't sound thin or tinny like you might expect from speakers of this size. There is a richness to the sound, certainly powerful enough to enjoy from across the room. The bass is natural and very audible - the way music should be heard! I personally don't want thumping bass even if I'm listening to hip hop or dance music.They look nice too. All in all, I can't imagine better sounding speakers than these if you're looking for something ultra-portable!"
4,"Good sound, Attractive appearance","I chose an iRiver H10 over the iPod and was looking for external speakers to use at home in place of a radio and CD sound system. (The H10 has an FM-tuner as well has handling mp3 and wma music/talk files.) I chose the JBL OnTour Speakers based in part on a few reviews, on the price, and the JBL reputation.The sound is good, but not spectacular. Most of my music is classical or Christian praise. The sound may be a touch better than the JBL speakers in my Compac laptop. If I had $300 to spend, I might see if Bose has an auxiliary input. But, I don't. The JBL speakers will do just fine.The appearance is pleasing, especially when the case is closed. A white cover slides back to reveal the silver speaker case. It has a small footprint and is currently sitting on my laptop caddy, next to my pc. If you are satisfied with good sound, and have $100 or so to spend, you will likely enjoy this product."
4,"Sounds good, decent price, nice package.","I purchased this product for our travels and have been very happy them. The do a good job filling a hotel room. Given the size of the unit I think they sound quite good. If you're an audiophile or need volume, you might find them a little bright. The bass is not strong, but it's adequate. I debated heavily over whether or not I would prefer speakers with a dock for my iPod. However, in the end, I decided it wasn't crucial. In actual use, I actually found it nice that I could pick up my iPod without having to move the speakers. They are very solid feeling although the 'click' that holds them open could be firmer (-1 star). Battery life seems to be good."
4,jbl on tour,This is an amazing product. It is very hard to find a speaker/sound system for an mp3 player - 99.9% of products are made exclusively for ipods. The sound on this is fabulous and the price is great. definitely a win/win product.
2,Doesn't Mix Well,"I bought this for a 5-gal bucket of Killz, but it's not easy to mix in. It's basically a damp clay consistency. It's difficult to get out of the package and even more difficult to mix into the paint thoroughly. If it actually works, I'll be pleased, but I'm not holding my breath..."
3,"looked very solid, but..","Was looking for a solid, reliable scale. Searched the Internet and had good experience with Soehnle products in the past and from the picture it looked like a solid piece of metal backed with a good reputation (Soehnle is a German company), so ordered it with great expectations. What arrived was a bit disappointing: the scale is not a piece of solid metal (as one could think from the picture), but made mostly of plastic (the back of the scale is metal, the front part is all plastic)and..it's not made in Germany, but China. Nevertheless, I take care to treat it gently and in return there have been no problems for over 2.5 years."
4,A thought-provoking documentary about the Templar legacy.,"Henry Lincoln and others explore the mysterious history of the Knights Templar, a sect of warrior monks who discovered a most compelling secret during their quests to the Holy Land and preserved that secret through ritual and symbology.Originally a BBC documentary, this program formed the basis for Holy Blood, Holy Grail-- a book Lincoln co-authored with fellow BBC researchers Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh-- which traces the Templar legacy through to modern times.This program is well worth watching if you are interested in the history of secret societies, medieval folklore, or the Crusades. It also paints an interesting panorama of Southern France and the beauty-- and mystery-- that permeates the landscape."
5,A volume well worth its weight in gold,"Red Sage publishes some of the best erotic romance available. I have three Secrets collections on my shelf and especially love the paranormals, with Amber Green's work providing the most intense sensory and emotional reading experience among the lot. I've read romance for years, and it takes a lot to challenge me and keep me guessing anymore. Green manages to keep the romantic element balanced with the plot and erotic content in every one of her stories--she infuses her tales with an honesty and rawness I find most unique and exciting."
4,Hotttt,"Not for the faint hearted. This book will surprise you and I had to learn the hard way, do not read when your at an appointment. I didn't even hear my name."
4,One of the good ones.,Sometimes the 'Secrets' books can be difficult to remember and kind of flow together. This one is very good.
5,"One of the most beautifully creative works of music genius, ever.","This CD, its entire contents, represent the idea of 'ART' in it's most beautiful, poetic form. Consisting of 52 tracks that range from touching songs such as 'Kitty' and 'Special2me', to lighthearted songs such ABC(For Kids) (Also highly educational, I mean I am by no means an educator, but if I were teaching my kids their ABC's I'd totally educate at them with this track.) And at 52 tracks, this album is a better deal than any other music that is available today. Every song is miracle in song form. It's just that magical. If you can listen to the samples, and still cannot be moved to buy this album, then perhaps you have no taste in music at all, or are poor."
1,North star books,False information.. I was looking for Native American Ak INDIANS Soiux Utes ect.. Language. the Amazon and the book stores gave me the impression I was buying said books.. When I was not. It was standard english spelling books for foreign people to learn our American English..
5,What did you do in the CIA daddy?,"A clear understanding of the U. S. presence in Afghanistan over the last thirty+ years has to be the starting point for us and others to judge our future actions there. The incoming Obama administration is proposing more troops. That call needs to be scrutinized with recent history in mind. How are we perceived? What have we done in the past? What was our involvement with the different parties, the Taliban, the Northern Alliance, the Pashtuns in the south, and the Tajik minority in the north, with Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia, just to name a few. All these forces and more are part of the narrative that Coll weaves in this book. The amount of research needed just to identify all the actors is humbling. That he also succeeds in making it very understandable with a clear readable narrative makes it exceptional."
5,Highly informative and engaging,"Exceptional read. In hindsight, one can only imagine what would be if we had taken the left instead of the right (no politics) or not chose certain countries to be part of the end game."
5,"Great Book, Read Detained Differences","This was a great novel, go buy Detained Differences by J. Robert Rowe. It is about Detainee Operations inside Afghanistan."
5,great book,This is the book that was given Obama to bring him up to speed on the subject - you can't put it down - well written -
5,"Gripping Documentary, Substantive, Riveting","This is, by far, the best written and most objective account of the recent history and US involvement in Afghanistan. If There is only one book that you should read, this is it. The authors research is extensive and the work is nothing short of astounding. The author easily takes the complex web of players and events and presents this extremely complex story with an astounding level of clarity and insight.The book is nothing short of Substantive. The book will keep you riveted and is extensive in its explanation of how we came to such systemic and systematic failure in our Foreign Policy. This is truly a classic story of ""Blowback"" and how a failure in analysis and understanding can lead to gross miscalulations, and worse, the unforeseen severity of unintended consequences. Truly a magnum opus on Afghanistan, the Taliban and the GWOT.Terry Tucker,Adjunct Prof Military Studies/HistoryCSTC-Afghanistan, Trainer and Doctrine Developer to the Afghan Army"
1,Standard Leftist Drivel,This is a rather predictable book. It is rife with the basic anti-anticommunist canards with some Clintonian apologia added.Considering it was written by a Washington Post editor and Pulitzer Prize winner its credibility is questionable. Why anyone would want to read it other than the liberal conspiracy theory club is unknown.Then again maybe that is all who is reading it.
5,"terrific, extremely informative read",To think that all this information was available to both the Clinton & two Bushes. Three administrations all ignored the warnings of their own staffs. Makes one wonder -- was there anybody home at the White Housefrom 1989 to 2002 (and after)?
3,Couldn't finish it.,"This was a good book for the complete history of how the middle east came to be the way it is today. But there was so much detail and it was so long and drawn out that I couldn't get excited about it. I read about 20% of this book and couldn't bring myself to continue. I didn't want to give it a bad rating since I didn't finish it so 3 Stars it is. I would only recommend this book to people who want things broken down to the ""gnats ass"" and don't mind reading a lot of stuff that is unnecessary to tell the story."
5,A thought provoking critique of forty years of American-Middle East foreign policy.,"Few Americans understand that our current Middle East policy has its roots in the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the Iraq-Iran war. Understand that, and take your first steps down the ""rabbit hole"" of geopolitics where enemies are created to bolster political clout and black can easily morph into white when advantageous. Coll's narrative sucks the reader into this black hole then gnaws away at their mindless, media controlled patriotism leaving them wondering when the dollar amount or body count will get high enough to end these quixotic escapades. An excellent and significantly current book!"
5,The Inertia of Democracy,"Steve Coll gives us a focused, detailed analysis of U S inertia in dealing with the building crisis of terrorism, as manifested by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda organization, in the decades running up to 9/11. Mr. Coll's balanced and well researched presentation aptly illustrates the dynamic tension which existed among the agencies and actors, countries and their leadership, and the varied and fluid Afghani factions.In particular the interworkings of the CIA, White House, Defense Department, FBI and related committees and leadership groups, across Democratic and Republican administrations, are methodically scrutinized. The struggle for consensus produced the policy logjam which seemingly left the U S defenseless against bin Laden's 9/11 terrorists.Although he falls short of making an outright assertion, the author ably demonstrates that 9/11 could have been prevented if the institutional inertia of the US government could have been overcome.Overall an excellent book."
5,Brilliant,"Objective, extremely well written in depth history of Afghani intrigues that reads with all of the excitement of a thriller. Deep character portraits, copious footnotes and an unqualified sense of ""let the cards fall where they may"" make this a must read if you can handle the truth about Islamic Fascism and its dangerous world vision."
5,A Historical Tour de Force,"Wow! Never have I read such an engaging, informative book of such importance. If you want to understand Middle East politics, conflicts and major principals and how they were affected by American power read Ghost Wars. I found it refreshing to read a true journalistic account as dispassionate and unbiased as Steve Coll's brilliant book. His background information on Middle East history and the movers and shakers was perfect - not too long-winded or short-shifted. About as perfect an investigative non-fiction book can be."
4,"great work, but reads like a textbook","as a 2 time Afghanistan veteran (and leaving for my 3rd very soon) this book had my vested interest. its a rather shocking, absolutley true, story of how America itself gave rise to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.if you are looking for light reading, this is not for you. it is massive and in depth. in many spots it reads like a textbook. it is a endurance test to finish the drier portions.reccomended."
5,Great book,"This is a great book. Another great example of a prize winning book making a complex subject matter approachable. If you're like me and read a lot of history books, you have no doubt come across those that are just cumbersome. You can get good info from them, but it is like pulling teeth! One minor thing the author does is repeatedly remind you of who people are (e.g. position in gov't) so that you aren't repeatedly flipping back and forth.Much of the book focuses on the Soviet invasion of Afganistan. I think that just can't be avoided because that set the stage for the rise of the Taliban, our relatoinship w/ Pakistan, etc.Nothing is included on the events of 9/11, so if you want that go elsewhere. If you've read other books like this (e.g. Charlie Wilson's War) you'll find this interesting to see the same characters revisited from different angles."
5,Gave me a new perspective of historical events,"The book carefully builds events, relating different topics and individuals to give you a good panoramic view of major events that were connected to the Sept 11 attacks. I particularly liked the part that describes the origins of Al Qaeda. Of course there are other points of view and this is the authors perspective, but the book is well documented and coherent. I recommend that you get the Kindle edition, the hardcover's 700+ pages tire your arms a bit after a while."
3,Informative,"But also has some political bias. I think Morgan Norval's ""The Fifteen Century War, Islam's Violent Heritage"" is far better and clearly more straightforward."
2,Long telling,"This book is very long in reading. It does not follow any folw to be seen but jumps around. It is informative on a historical view however, to get to the few usfull items the reader has to read one mans musing."
3,endless words on terror,"haven't finished reading it yet.what struck me immediately though is numerous claims of soviet atrocities and human rights abuses against civilians without properly citing documentation as to the origin of these claims. this occurs within the initial 50 pages or so.not that i'm a apologist for the former soviet union in any respect. the 'evacuation executions' of the red army during barbarossa are well documented, esp. in richard rhodes' recent work: ' masters of death: the ss-einstatzgruppen and the invention of the holocaust.'"
5,Poulan Lawn Edger Attachment,Purchased this for my Poulan trimmer and it works very well. Easy installation and it does a good job. It has a cutting depth adjustment for different applications.
5,Poulan Pro Edger Attachment,"I really like the attachment, it is much easier than having to drag out another edger and it is a lot easier to use."
5,Perfect so far,I have only used this edger a few times so far but it has worked very well. My driveway and walk ways look so much better.
3,Great for light duty,"This is a nice edger for smaller jobs. If you have a bigger area that you need to edge, I would recommend that you buy a dedicated edger. I find that once you get your lawn edged once, this edger works best if you do so again every three weeks or so. I have a 28cc troy-built power head and that is plenty of power, it hasn't bogged down or anything, even in thick spots. If you edge every time you cut your lawn, you will need 7.5"" blades, herePoulan Pro 952711625 7.5-Inch Replacement Edger Blade For PP1000E Attachmentthey are a good quality blade and have worked well for me. They way it adjust is a little weird, but it does work. If you are looking for a good quality quick attack edger, this is it. I don't think that it would work well in commercial use.PS-- How sharp and long your blade is has a direct effect on how well it will work, so if your blade gets under about 6.75"", do yourself the favor and spend $6.00 on a new blade. they make a huge difference."
3,Works great but could not remove the blade for replacement.,"This works really well, but could not remove the original blade (took it to professionals). So, I have to order a new one. The blade worked for 2 years."
4,Works as expected,The lawn edger attachment works without problems. I'm using it with Poulan Pro PP125 and the engine of this trimmer is a bit short of power for the lawn edger.
4,Very Good Edger,"I received my edger yesterday while cutting grass (what perfect timing). I recently purchased the Poulan Pro PP125 and it works good. Attached the edger to the trimmer right out of the box. The edger works fine but it takes a few minutes (and sparks) to get the hang of it, especially if your area has not been edged in awhile. but on pre-edged surfaces it works great. The attachment does make it a little heavy on the end, especially if you are a tall person (I'm 6'3"" and it gave my back a good workout). I've been edging with a string BlacknDecker trimmer the past 5 years and wish I had switched long time ago. Make sure you tighten the thumb screw on the ""U"" handle of the trimmer, as it will move with the weight of this attachment. All in all, this thing works good, and looks good too."
5,Great edger attachment,I bought this attachment the same time I bought the Poulan Pro PP125 17-Inch 25cc 2-Cycle Gas Powered Straight Shaft String Trimmer With Split Shaft. I live in a residential neighborhood on a corner lot with sidewalks and I have a lot of concrete to edge. This combination cut my edging time in half and cuts a beautiful edge all around my lawn. I edge once a week and this baby made a huge edge job a snap. I highly recommend this edger attachment.
4,Poulan lawn edger attachment,"I am quite please with this edger. This attachment turned a seldom used tree pruner into a tool that we use on a regular basis. Our lawn hadn't been edged since our weed eater died. I was debating whether to fix or replace the weed eater and realized we used it mostly for edging. So instead we got this and now have a tool that does an easier and better job of edging for less money than buying a new edger or a new weed eater. I should have used a spade to edge the sidewalks the first time though. It was a bit hard on the engine (and on me) the first time I used it. After the first couple of weeks, it became a lot easier on the tool and on me. If it gives years of trouble-free use, it will deserve a 5-star rating."
4,Works great ... and saves dollars,"Would give this the full Five Stars but it is not perfectly durable ... mine lasted a bit more than two years with every other week edging of lots of pavement. Probalby about 300 feet or so. I have thick wet lawn (live on lake with free water, it is never dry here!) making the edger work overtime. For this small price a second after 2 summers (admittedly Michigan summers which kinda don't really exist ... :) Really they exist and grass grows lush and thick here, you just almost never can swim and enjoy a real summer :) Nice product don't shy away!"
4,Good but connection at top is little weak.,Works well. After two years of minimal use the connections is getting loose and worn at the top of the shaft. It's still working.
4,Works well,"This is a great little attachment for the money. Works really well. I just wish it were a little wider. But, still worth it."
4,Great,Works great. The only reason not five stars is it is hard to balance and the handle is not the greatest.
4,Nice attachment,I needed an edger that would attach to my existing Poulan line trimmer. This item filled the bill nicely and so far it has performed flawlessly.The only negative that I have experienced is that I needed to make some changes to the way it was assembled to get it to rotate 90 degrees to use it as a brush cutter. It would not turn to the correct position to cut brush on my trimmer without that modification. I will need to undo/redo the modification depending on whether I am edging or cutting brush.
3,it's okay,"Great idea, and great price. However, don't use this if your wanting to just edge around the lawn. This is more for getting your trenches dug and even then it can still take a while."
5,Really gets the job done !,Works exactly as advertised ! Easy to use and for anyone looking for a versatile tool this is a no brainier !
4,works fine,"works as advertized. Nothing more and nothing less. satisfied purchasetakes little bit to get used to. After using it several times, it digs out a nice little ditch that makes the following passes much easier."
2,"Good for easy reading, bad for serious history","I read this book looking for something that had short stories, was about the Old West, and that I could finish rather quickly before getting involved in something more substantial. For that purpose the book was great. However, for a book that is supposed to correct myths, he amazingly contributes to them. For instance, echoing Mari Sandoz, he writes that Custer wanted to be president. I can't criticize all the facts from all the stories, because I don't have the knowledge to do so, but based on his chapter on Custer, one must question his other data. Also, the bibliography is very sparse and there are no footnotes. The absence of footnotes is understandable for this type of book which is easy reading. But again, he doesn't seem to have really done too much hardcore research."
4,Pretty good,"This book is not for history scholars, but in saying that it's a great read. If you're looking for some light reading on the old west and enjoy mini-stories buy this book."
3,ACCEPT THIS BOOK FOR WHAT IT IS,"Why are all of these folks complaining about what a bookis or isn't??? Accept it for what it is. Sure, I have heard / readabout a lot of these ""stories"" before, but, I found a couple of ""new""ones. I didn't know about Kid Curry or Comanche {the horse}.Have fun and read it!!!"
5,"Its SCSI at its best, Ultra3, Ultra160","I upgraded from a slow, yet still faster than IDE Adaptec 2940UW. When the controller bios started, it actually displayed the speed of the connected devices! That is the most simplest way to see if you device is configured and running at its optimum. Then came the applications and games...unbelievable speed with a 10k rpm 36gig hard drive. Way to go Adaptec!"
3,Vema Electronics sent a 'bare' card with a homemade driver cd,"I just purchased an Adaptec 19160 card and was surprised to receive it as a are card with a home made driver cd. While for the price this is probably a bargain, I was led to believe by the ad and its text and pictures I would be receiving a genuine 19160 kit and not just a bare card.I have yet to install it, but I expect it works."
4,3 1/2 stars for a small club concert,"Trower still has his guitar playing gifts as he performs here at a small club in Bonn, Germany. Backed by a drummer, a bass player and vocalist (Robin doesn't sing much), he hits some of the greats including a nice merge of ""Day of the Eagle"", and ""Bridge of Sighs"" but some of the other ""newer"" songs are easily forgotten. What isn't forgotten is Trower's guitar playing, and this is when every song soars. This DVD looks pretty good when upconverted. It has a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio and has a choice of compressed Dolby Digital 5.1 or PCM Stereo."
3,Concise Version of Overland Campaign,"This is a 330 page account of the entire Overland campaign that reads much like a diary from April to mid June as the Army of the Potomoc goes from north of the Rapidan to Petersburg. The account shifts back and forth from the workings of the two armies to Richmond/Washington and elsewhere.Most of the book focuses on primary sources to tell the story, with nice anecdotes on just about every page. However, without the use of footnotes and with only 4 maps total (which are incredibly hard to comprehend), the flow of battle is exceedingly hard to follow.This book certainly doesn't compare to the Rhea trilogy that covers the same campaign in any way whatsoever. This is more of a primer for the beginner before reading Rhea's books."
3,"May be picky, but I'm a visual person","and the absence of maps (there are 4 very dark grey maps at very beginning of book) detracted from the well written text. There were a lot of troop movements and significant salients during this 6-week segment of the war, but no maps to show the shifting positions and relative locations described. His book on Gettysburg is one of the best I've ever read, and there were numerous maps, (which I found very helpful), so I was a little disappointed that this book had so few."
3,Mediocre,"An entertaining read to be sure, but also a cut-and-paste account that offers no real analysis and relies too much on post-war sources."
2,Worth about what it costs,In the style of the Hornblower series but no where near as good. Some of the events are so ridiculous as to defy belief. The nautical details are extensive ala C S Forester but the plot is trite and .predictable.
2,Not Worth Your Time Or Money,"Other than the bloated first chapter, a Floyd free history of the album and concept album, there's nothing here you cannot get from Nick Schaffner's ""A Saucerful of Secrets."" Despite the pedigree of the authors, there is no interpretation, no insight offered here on the album, show or film. Again, get the better and more comprehensive Schaffner for history, and if you want criticism, get Phil Rosen's ""Which One's Pink."""
1,Not worth your money,"If you buy this book on speculation that it might help you, you're probably wrong. Not to say that some have been helped by it, but most of you (I presume) will be sorely displeased. Of the hundreds of listings, there are less than five that include contact names. And do you know what that means? That means if you send your query to these studios it'll probably end up in the trash., or at least take several months to get into the right hands, if ever. There are better works in the world."
4,review of queasy drops,"Good product that has the perfect sour bite that we pregnant ladies crave. Doesn't take away the terrible worst nausea, but does a good job."
2,ARRIVED DAMAGED,"lOVE THE LOOK OF THE SHOE. HOWEVER, WHEN I TOOK THEM OUT OF THE BOX THE HEEL TIP WAS BROKEN. I TWISTED IT BACK INTO PLACE AND STRAPED THEM ON AND THE STRAP SNAPPED RIGHT IN HALF. VERY DISAPPOINTED. SHOES RAN EXTREMELY NARROW AND SMALLER THAN A 7.5. I WAS DISAPPOINTED AND LOVED THE SHOE SO ORDERED THEM AGAIN A SIZE BIGGER HOPING THEY DON'T ARRIVE DAMAGED."
3,Mosquito stix,"PRODUCT WORKS OK, BUT HAS AN ODER SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU PEE ON A CAMP FIRE."
2,The usual from Prima,"Boy, was I disappointed. This ""strategy guide"" had NO strategy. Heck, it didn't even have a good layout for the moves!! I bought this book for the characters exclusive to the PlayStation version, hoping for a COMPLETE moves list for them, but of course, I was wrong. It didn't even have combos, and what they passed off as combos were actually the 10-strings that are already in the game! The strategy disgraces the genius of Tekken! I could probably beat Simon Hill because the Versus Books strategy guide was actually a strategy guide! And that strategy guide was actually made by national Tekken champs!Don't get this strategy guide. The best parts of the book are ones you can glance through when you're sitting down reading it in the newstand. The artwork (4 measly pieces that you can download) and the history of Namco are the only things going for it."
4,Tekken 3 fans rejoice!,This guide by Simon Hill is the one thing you'll ever want if you're a Tekken 3 fan. Comprehensive screenshots and tons of combos are all included. Recommended to people who want to mash buttons with authority.
5,Très bon guide.,J'adore ce guide du jeu Tekken 3 comme je l'ai depuis 1998 car c'est un très bon livre où il explique bien les mouvements des personnages comme il y a tout pour finir le jeu à 100 % donc je suis pas réu et je suis satisfait.
3,Tekken 3 : Prima's Official Strategy,"The guide for tekken 3 could have been better. They spent lots of time with the photos, but some of the moves were either wrong or incomplete(paul's tackle to choke move). King's links could have been explained better, and there is lack of actual combos for all the characters. I enjoyed brady's guide better."
4,large book,"it's very colorful, butthe link throws for king are very hard to understand. They don't tell you in what order you can link his throws and that's why I chose VRBooks instead."
1,unbelievable,"The TWO tracks on this CD are very good. The problem, however, is that the tracks are not listed in the ordering information. There are TWO tracks--Rhythm of the Rain and The Last Leaf. This means you will be as surprised as I was when you get your 5 minute long CD."
4,Synovial-Flexx Joint Care Soft Chews,This product was recommended by our veterinarian. I hope the product will help my dog with his rear joints. This product is much more expensive from the vet. My only complaint is that what I was actually charged on my credit card was $4 more than my order amount but it will be worth it if it helps my dog.
2,SynovialMax Stale Chews,"Our original order was lost and it took approx. 5 weeks to get our order. Amazon was great to ship it overnight but when we got the product the chews were dry, somewhat stale. We have used these before and also the SynoviG3 and I can tell when a product is either old or stored improperly."
1,Can't get answers,"I purchased SynoviaMax Soft Dog Chews from Amazon because the advertising showed 3 containers for $82.95. The email confirmation shows only 1 container. I have tried to contact Amazon, I have sent emails to inquiry or stop the order if the price was in fact for just one container. I can not get a response and I can't cancel the order. I will never order from Amazon again.Deborah Fleming"
5,"Italian Genealogical Records: How to Use Italian Civil, Ecclesiastical & Other Records in Family History Research",This book is a excellent reference for italian genealogy research. Detailed informations and very well explained. I recommend it. Excellent book!
2,Cartridge did not last,"This model cartridge also fits C534n. Cartridge printed fine for many months. However, it did not last under light usage. I suspect it was a 4K yield cartridge."
3,"Good information, but the book could use some polish.",The book has some useful touring information presented with a sense of humor. It could use a little polish and some color pictures would make it more appealing. Overall it will save the reader some time in planning a motorcycle trip to Arizona and is worth reading.
4,funny,I enjoy riding in Arizonia so i purchased this book to check out areas i may have missed. So far most of the book is great and sometimes funny . The author took the time to add personal remarks about the trips and places to visit if time permits. Over all a very enjoyable read and lots of information you may be able to use in conjunction to road maps of the areas described .
4,WOW,"This is a story of a young man's unremitting pain.He is the product of a highly disfunctional family, he is in a constant state of sexual and religious confusion and he is totally alone.It's a story about rage,deceit,despair,vengence and hope.It's a story about misunderstandings and enlightenment.The average reader will find a lot of unfamiliar words, thoughts and ideas written here. But the average reader has no business with this book. If you are an average reader put this book back on the shelf and move on.However,if you are looking for impact and the reasons for mental illness and violence it is necessary that you read this book. You will learn a lot from Boots Satchel and you will definitely feel his pain."
3,not a great album,"while I still have a soft spot in my heart for ""the kid"" (especially his savage NWA deconstruction of a few years ago), the sad fact is that this album is merely ""ok"".try another disc or catch him live if you want to find out what all the (somewhat) deserved hype is about.or better yet check out any of the recent tigerbeat6 compilations. good stuff and a great label."
5,Good Introduction,"This is a great book, that is easy to read and gives a good introduction to the teaching of reincarnatoin in Christianity. Such a topic is not easy to address, especially when we have to take into account that Origen had many levels of teachings. He kept reincarnation for those who had already understood the basic teachings of Christ, thus, some people, like one of the other reviews, might be confused when they come across seemingly contridictory writings in the works of the great Early Church Father, Origen."
2,Origen,"Origen ""strongly advocated the inclusion of reincarnation as a legitimate Christian concept""? This is what the back cover states. Is this the same Origen who wrote:""In this place it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I should fall into the dogma of transmigration, which is foreign to the church of God, and not handed down by the Apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the Scriptures.""(Origen, Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew - Book 13, Chapter 1.)If you want a good treatment of Christianity vs. Reincarnation, read ""When Skeptics Ask"" by Norman Geisler."
3,Measurements are incorrect in description,"The description says that this cart is 19 inches tall. This is the primary reason why I ordered this model over several others. It arrived today and I quickly put it together. Instead of being 19 inches tall, it is only 13 inches tall. I guess I will keep it because it appears sturdy and I am unable to find one of the height I need.Amazon needs to correct its description."
4,Not for children,"Those who loved Tangerine and were eagerly awaiting Edward Bloor's second novel will want to get their hands on The Crusader, especially after seeing the spectacular cover. Warning! Even the author cautions that this look at the seamy underside of life in Florida is not for elementary school children. With a murder, a suicide, skinheads, and talk of leg-breaking loansharks, this is world children should not enter. How about for teenagers? Once you get past the fact that the Crusader thing never really happens, Bloor scores another look at humanity's darker side. As I read this book, I became progressively annoyed waiting for the Crusader to become central to the story. It never does. The virtual reality game always remains a colorful backdrop to a world of goths, racism, and backroom politics. If you can hang on through the extended middle, the conclusion hammers home with some powerful observations about life in America in the 21st century."
2,I guess I didn't get it...,"As an adult reader of YA novels, I was excited to begin reading one with such an intriguing cover and setup. I enjoyed the book for the first quarter or so, whereupon the author decided not to credit the readers with the ability to detect subtle themes. He began to throw themes in the reader's face with absurd redundancy, in case the reader hadn't picked them up already. The book was unnecessarily dark, the characters completely one-dimensional with only one part to play in the book, and the action was coreographed to fit the theme, not necessarily the characters. A poor showing, stilted, and with all the subtlety of a racist remark in a public place."
3,Crusader Corrupts,"I am a pre-teen reader, and although the characters were well developed, I found the book very violent and offensive. The book includes drugs, rascim, and murder, and because of the detailed way the author describes these crimes, it seems very real. However a younger reader may not fully understand or be ready for some of the issues in Crusader."
1,Holy cow what a waste of money,Okay. I read Tangerine 7 times and loved it more each time. I read this and hated it. It is a disgrace to Edward Bloor. It is very bland and boring. It took me about a month to finish reading it and it would of taken me about 10 days if I liked it. Don't read it. It is hard to get into (because you don't ever get into it). It is a waste of money. I didn't even buy it and I felt sorry for my aunt for wasting the money on it.DON'T BUY IT
5,Crusader,"I had choosen this book for my English 200 book report and once i had started reading this book i just couldnt put it down. I had been guessing many different murderes for her mother but when i found out who it REALLY was i was shocked and it was 100% unexpected, after reading this book i read ""Tangerine"", loved it and now i am currently expect a copy of ""Story Time"" for my own collecton , Congrats on yet antoher Great Novle by Edward Bloor!"
3,"I prefered Edward Bloor's First Novel, Tangerine","Crusader was a good story, a really excellent plot. But as a writer myself, I can easily say that it was too long. There was a good deal of unneeded information stuffed into the novel. If it was kept simpler it would have been a much better book. But it was still a worthwhile read. The ending is fantastic and Edward Bloor does have an amazing writing style. But Tangerine was a truly amazing book if you need to read something by this author."
4,Casí perfecto ...,"El maletín es muy cómodo para cargarlo, además tiene muy buena apariencia, la impresora Kodak G600 encaja muy bien pero para mi cámara el espacio queda demasiado ajustado. Yo tengo una Kodak Z612. Se supone que deberían poder almacenarse ambas cosas (la cámara y la impresora), pero repito la cámara la hago entrar a la fuerza."
4,Gas Giant - 'Mana' (Electrohash Records) 4 1/2 stars,"Good old-fashioned 'heavy stoner rock' here, to be fully and thoroughly take in. Eleven well produced and played tracks here that provides the listener(s) with a most memorable experience. Might be tagged as stoner rock,but Gas Giant seems to also have much of a psych edge too. When I first got this CD, I played it like every other day for maybe a month. Tunes I found myself looking forward to were the soaring ""There's One"", ""Moonshake"", the somewhat-ripping ""Not A Man"", ""Back On The Headless""(love that stunning synth work), ""Dragon's Cave"" (couldn't help but to notice the H-E-A-V-Y guitar)and the fourteen-minute way-out there spaced-out psychedelic freak out, with plenty of fluid guitar ""Safe Haven"". This cut is worth the admission price alone. Line-up:Jesper-vocals, Stefan-guitar, Thomas-bass, Scott-synthesizer and Tommy-drums. Might appeal to fans of Monster Magnet, Kyuss and Electric Wizard. Simply, a must-have."
3,The Spark Appears Lost On Island Magic,"I have had the pleasure of reading all of Ms Ford's novels but this one was one that I had the most difficult reading. It actually took me close to two weeks to finish reading this book because it was a slower read for me and the difficulty I had in dealing with the conflict between Cassandra and Gordan.I realize with a relationship these two had for four and a half years proved to have some highs and lows. But the stubborness and lack to bend on either party began to take a serious toil on me while reading this book.For the most part, I cannot say I did not enjoy the story but it was not as fast moving and interesting as the others written by this author.Here are my favorites of Bette Ford: After Dark, One of a Kind, For Always and Forever After."
2,Predictable and Unimaginative,"After reading all of Bette Ford's other books, I was anxiously awaiting the release of Island Magic. I was so disappointed. This story about a couple who had been together 4 1/2 years and broken up because one of them wanted to get married and the other didn't was so boring. There is no build up to their romance,the flash backs were too brief, and the story had no intrigue or juicy conflict. You just knew how the story was going to end. I hope Ms. Ford's next book is much better."
3,Nothing special,"Was buying some other things from the seller so I stuck these in the cart, too. They work ok but the foam is not the softest. Was worried about swirl marks. The lip around the edge of the pad (where the foam is pressed/cut) is quite hard. I ended up cutting it off with scissors: problem solved. If they come the way I made them after cutting I'd give them 4 stars."
3,Nice work light,"I recently purchased this worklight and was very happy with the many mounting options it offered; you can pretty much put this anywhere you need to get light on a specific area. However, be careful where you mount it, as with all halogen lights, this one gets real hot.I gave it only 3 stars, because when after about 15-20 hours of use, the bulb blew in a spectacular ""pop""; which was a bit strange, since I know not to handle/touch a halogen bulb when installing it, and that it took that long before it failed. (Now I have to buy a replacement bulb)"
1,Accurite,"Probably a good product, however I have not received yet and it has been almost a month. They shipped weather machine instead. Said they would ship thermometer, and a return box for the weather machine. That was 2 weeks ago, and I have still received neither."
2,Not too happy so far...,"Bought this last year. Used it twice to grill with good results. Suddenly it stopped working. It would usually only show Hi and Lo, but worked intermitently. I replaced the probe - which is about 1/2 the cost of the unit. So far so good, but this is the last chance I'm giving this unit. If it breaks again its going into the trash.update: it went in the trash. The new probe lasted about a week."
3,"Works OK, but the alarm is not loud enough",The thermometer works ok but the alarm in not loud enough and the printing (meat/temperature chart) is too small for my old man eyes.
2,Smell is too strong.,"Smell is too strong. I tried this for a week and just didn't like the smell. I do like the smell of a vanilla candle, but not vanilla on my face. As a toner for my oily areas on my face, I like Burts Bees tomato toner better."
1,Not the taste that I was hoping for....,"I love this brand of Soy chips and have tried many other flavors, so I was happy to try ""Nacho cheese"". I was hoping for a Dorito's taste, but I was very disappointed when I took my first bite. These have an after-taste that I never experienced with the other flavors of Genisoy brand Soy Crisps. I won't ever buy this flavor again."
3,Useful but not very comprehensive,"This book offers the advantage of being short and introducing the general reader to recent events in Kashmir. However, I think the book is less of a rigorous history than an advocacy piece. Newberg is right to emphasize the human rights abuses and political repression of Kashmir by the Indian central (federal) government; however, this does not bring out the complexity of the problem, which is also influenced by economic conditions, military assistance from Pakistan, and the inevitable problem with all guerrilla movements, which is that they need popular support, but can quickly turn into oppressors themselves. And the writer seems to have interviewed a lot of militant group members, but not that many local people or government officials for their side of the story. For a more detailed, recent historical analysis, see Sumit Ganguly's book on the Crisis in Kashmir."
1,Real problem,"Getting the flashlight is a real problem. After paying for expedited shipping on Dec 1, meaning Dec 8th -- at the latest -- arrival. Still waiting on the 17th. Called customer service, who promised to call back in 10 minutes. Never heard back on status. Filed a claim for reimbursement on the item."
5,A Great Starter!,"I have several OOP books that I put aside because they became fustrating and/or clumsy. This book has made it possible to pickup those once forgotten books.A big plus for this book is that all the examples work and you can download the chapter examples from Apress! The user friendly analogies make it an easy read. The only resistance I experienced was the free personal UML modeler that was referenced in the first part of the book. The first pass through these chapters I followed along by creating the diagrams by hand. After reading the rest of the book, I spent half a day learning the software and completing the chapter examples.For me, this author paints a pretty good big picture of OOP! My other books are now helping with the details;)"
5,"entertaining, and in only one book","Hey, this is a good book. It has a story that is told in one volume, and does not develop through haphazard accidents. I highly reccommend it for someone looking for an entertaining read. The story does not need 5 volumes and 5000 pages to get to the end. Buy it. Read it."
2,Interesting ideas marred by clumsy writing and weak characters,"This book was on my shelf for years before I finally got around to reading it -- or actually, skimming it, because it wasn't very good. The imaginary world is interesting and seems to be fairly well thought out, but the writing is clumsy -- the author jumps from one character's head to another indiscriminately, often within the same paragraph. A few interesting plot twists are hinted at but never developed. Worst of all, despite the rather complex delineation of gender roles the author has imagined for her nomadic tribespeople, the female characters remain helpless, emotional and weepy throughout."
2,JavaScrimp,"I picked up this book looking for a JavaScript book to use in the classroom. I'm still looking. The authors start with code without giving a good overview of the syntax. I found very little useful content in the 169 pages. Unless you are coding by hand, most of the routines are easily generated with a tool like ColdFusion."
2,Proper Coding Would Help,"I really regretted buying this book. For the most part it's a descent book but for it's not for a beginner. There were a few tags that the code left out. I'm referring to the scripting for JavaScript Navigation. The FORM tag was missing and it wasn't giving a NAME attribute. A beginner would not have picked this up so easily. I don't recommend this for beginners. If you really want the book, contact me and I'll give you my copy..."
2,Good concept- bad book.,"I chose to buy this book because I liked the concept of having a book which was supposed to be ""essential"" for the real Webmaster world. However, I find (I'm still struggling through) myself wasting time on trying to figure out all the coding mistakes. The mistakes start in chapter 1. The zip files which you download off the net (which contain the code for the projects mentioned throughout the book) are also done in a poor manner, the book does not refer you to a certain file. Another example is that you have to figure out where to move the images files in order to have them sourced correctly to the images. I would not recommend this book until a new corrected, updated edition with CD will be available."
4,Good Reference Book,"This book, I have found, is not especially conducive to reading straight through. However it serves my purposes as a refence tool quite well. The last 500 pages are nothing but explanations of the [most] commands available in UNIX. There are very few examples in this area of the book though. Overall, page for page, I think you'll find this book gives you the most quantitative and qualitative information for your buck."
3,interesting overview of complex situation,"Mandani's book is not for everyone; it is written in a highly academic form and reads slowly. However, if you can get through it, there are fascinating revelations of the chronology and effect of the early colonialism upon the inhabitants of Rwanda that allow you to understand, once again, the lessons of history....that NOTHING happens in a vacuum....and we Westerners, we ""great civilizers"" have much to learn and much evolving to do.I haven't finished it yet and I do wish it were an easier read...I would give it to people I know who really NEED to read it but who never will. It's just too hard."
4,Essential reading for anyone wanting to learn the truth about what happened in Rwanda and why!,"This isn't about justifying the atrocious acts of Hutus against Tutsi in Rwanda, but about trying to understand WHY. There were reasons for the madness that went beyond ethnic differences. Read this book before passing judgement."
4,Art Work,Like wearing a piece of artwork. Very substatial and highly crafted. Iwould recommend it for males beacause it is big and fairly heavy.I have a piece I bought for $38 and this design is similar. Great for silver chain and for casual dress up. Tough to beat for the price!It definitely stands out.
2,ok and need work,CHEAP A** METAL this is about to break and its rusted in places but its kinda cool more yang than yin.
4,Does the job well for small and medium sized bananas. Doesn't fit larger bananas.,"Does the job well for small and medium sized bananas. Doesn't fit larger bananas so the tops still get brown. If it fits the bananas though, it really does keep the banana from getting brown and mushy."
1,Cute but not very useful,"Saw this in the store and was very excited to use it. My son loves bananas, but usually only eats half at a time. I thought the banana saver would be a cleaner way to store the uneaten half. I didn't really see how this kept the banana from getting brown, and you have to make sure to clean cut the end, which isn't always easy when your child wants to peel and eat the banana on their own. Also I found cleaning it to be difficult, it took quite a bit of work to get all the banana slime out of the cracks."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these at Walgreens for the list price. I wouldn't even pay what Amazon is selling them for. I wouldn't even take these if they were giving them away for free. These are the worst headphones I've ever had. I've had a bad run with headphones lately, so I thought I'd spend a little extra on something for my iPod and hopefully have something with better quality and great sound. I got neither.I can say that they're the most comfortable buds I've ever had. But that's it. They're shoddy. First day of wear, within first five minutes, the volume control slide fell off. Already broken and unreturnable.Now onto the sound quality. I am by no means an audiophile, but I can hear crap. These are soooo tinny. I feel like my music is being listened to through a drain pipe. Parts of songs are completely lost. Nothing I've tried (turning headphones volume up and iPod volume down, etc.) has made it any better.So to sum it up: Don't buy these EVER and I really really want my money back."
1,simply awful,"They sound muddy, indistinct and filtered, almost as if someone were playing music loudly while you were underwater. The headphones the ipod brings are incomparably better, which should give you an idea as to how horrible this product is. Under no circumstances should you even consider purchasing this."
2,Rosary Vine Purchase,"I was wondering how a plant would ship. The shipping time could not have been quicker. The plant arrived intact. I was disappointed that it was not as full as pictured. I am sure it will eventually grow into a nice plant. It is like seeing a Burger King advertisment for a Whopper on TV. When you get it, it is not quite like it was pictured."
2,Cheap - probably not durable,"Looks ok once installed, but the tray is flimsy and attaches to the bracket poorly. The screws can easly stip the holes - so be careful. The 1st one I ordered had the tabs for the tray broken off, but amazon quickly shipped a replacement. After using this product I would recommend another brand."
3,car kit,"I have still yet to install. I am confuse becuase I have a 98 with a 2000 style factory radio. My boyfriend is telling me that it is not going to fit, and somewhat abandoned the product. But so far, it looks good in the box. Shipping was fast...I guess if this is a product that u need.... its a good value, considering they do not have alot of SATURN kits in my area."
3,Not a good choice for 2DIN head unit.,"The manufacturer describes this as being modifiable for use with 2DIN units. This is to be accomplished by cutting out the crossbar/divider in the center of the face and removing the flashing and mounting related to the storage pocket. The as-designed molding of this unit does not provide any provision to remove the divider without leaving visibly glaring remnants unless the headunit projects above the faceplate. My Pioneer AVIC-F90BT for example does not allow this. While the result is functional, and this kit is inexpensive, I'd suggest that if you want a clean looking final result you would need to look at a different product."
3,so so,did not fit 2004 Saturn ion had to cut the dash to make it work i would recommended people to get measurements prior to buying
2,Cheap,It's cheap and you can tell. Mine came in missing 2 of the plastic pegs and then the screws barely reach to screw down. Easily stripped. Had a hard time fitting the radio in and then into the car. It looks okay now that it's in.
1,Cost??,I have seen this online on other sites and in catalogs for $20 (not on sale either - regular price). Same size
3,Pretty Good Product,"This really helped me out with my sofabed, I was having a problem with the bar in the middle of the bed making my back hurt & after I purchased Sleeper Sofa 48"" x 48"", it really made my sleep a lot better."
1,This is terrible,"This is one of the worst movies ever. I bought it b/c I grew up in Astoria. Really simplistic plot and bad acting. If you want to see Astoria, the neighborhood, in a movie, see Used People, filmed on 34th Street off of 30th Ave. (I know b/c I lived on that block) or A Bronx Tale (filmed further up on 30th Avenue), or Goodfellas (also in the same area) or, even, Queens Logic, which is pretty bad but will give you lots of the neighborhood as well as Kevin Bacon, which is never a bad thing. There's a big movie studio in Astoria (aside from Silvercup in LIC) so you'll see Astoria as a stand-in for other NYC neighborhoods."
3,"Decent, But Not Great","This was the first Centinex album I've been exposed to, so I can't say I'm really familiar with this band and it's style(s). On a first impression, though, I think I have to say that I've heard much better stuff out there, and, like another reviewer here mentioned, this album could be a lot heavier. It almost seems as though the guys in this band hold back a few times. The fake drum thing does actually get in the way of enjoying the music at various points, but it doesn't make for a bad album. Still, the music here is pretty heavy with all things considered, and since I bought this CD for like $5 at a used book/cd store then I can say I'm not disappointed. However, I'd suggest checking out other bands before you by this one retail full price. If you're a fan of heavy metal, I'd suggest checking out the Swedish stuff first."
2,Errors errors errors!,"TONS of errors! Not only in the material but all across the practice problems. Every class, the professor hands out a sheet to highlight the errors in the reading/assignment. Honestly, I don't know why he chose to use this book with so many glaring errors. I'm sure this book probably has good material, but that's all pretty much pointless if everything is incorrect..."
4,Beautiful Coffee Table Book,"Great book. The photography captures the true essence of a woman. No makeup or structured poses. No costumes or props. Just her, in her own home, waking up like the rest of us. I love it."
3,A carefully planned work,"When I first read this book I have exactly the same though as another reviewer ""A Reader from N.Y."". It has been planned too carefully and ""artificial"" and I believe ""real"" women before 10 a.m. is something you won't be interested to look at twice. However those who like to look at pretty women and b/w photos this is quite a good one."
4,Great Skins!,"These skins are so fine for the price that I was shocked when I received them. The most difficult thing is getting the skins on the remote and numchuck. Fortunately I found that if you gather them up before you slide them on and work them down, they are fine. I would have like the skins the new WII remotes have as there is an air cushion in them, but these are fine and exactly as advertised. Colors are true to description. Shipping was fast and efficient."
2,Get what you pay for,"They were inexpensive. They fit much tighter than the clear ones that come with it, so go on a lot harder, and come off even worse. The first one ripped when getting it off. They don't provide the drop protection as the original ones do, as there is no cushion. I had to try it, but it wasn't so great."
3,wiimote covers,"these were very inexpensive, and as the saying goes, you get what you paid for. they're not bad, but they are cheap. they fit the controller fine. i am curious how long they will last though. the pink and the white are the nicest."
2,Not Bad,"These skins are good, they do stop the controller from slipping. I wouldn't recomend using the cover for the nunchuck controller, it's hard to get on and one of them ripped in the process."
2,not as advertised,"I had to wait for the company to get around to even confirming my order, and when it arrived it was not what i ordered. They sent only three colours(I got 2 pink) I have to go out now and buy another colour because I have 3 grandson's, I don't think one of them want's pink."
1,sucks,IU bought these thinking they were simular to the jackets that come with the Wii remotes. But they are much harder to attach. I ripped two of them trying to put them on. Ended up throwing the rest away.
3,Decent accessory for your Wii controllers,Main reason I got these was to reduce the grime and grunge that accumulates in the crevices of your controller (most of you should know what i'm talking about). These do just that. I only needed two of these things but it never hurts to have another set lying around. Work really well and pretty non-slip grip so you won't have to worry about flinging your controller through the TV screen.
3,Not practical!,"Super snug fit which makes it hard to get on the remote. That is no big deal in itself. The problem is once you put it on it becomes impossible to use rechargeable base station and similar items. If you are not using rechargeable battery pack, then you have to drag this tight cover off and on each time you change the batteries. It is not worth the effort. You will start leaving it off altogether like me. Not practical!"
2,Silicon/silicone Skin Snap-on Cover Case for Nintendo Wii Remote,"It is a cheap option to protect Wii Mote, but it is not too resistent"
4,Nice ring,"I ordered this ring in a 9. It was to big. I ordered this ring in an 8.5. It was the exact same size as the 9. Now I have 2 rings that are too big. But, they look nice and are very comfortable."
4,Good item for the price,"The edges are a little sharp, but my boyfriend says it's not in any way uncomfortable. He loves it and it's incredibly durable. It's a really great price for what you get!"
3,Ring looks great,"This ring looks great, but the outside edge is very sharp. On occasion has given small ""paper"" like cuts. But it really looks nice and is very well made."
5,ring,"got it to us within 4 days or so. quality of the ring is good... overall, just a great purchase at a good price."
2,Dull!,"The story starts off well, with interesting characters. But 1/3 of the way, it is just boring. Pages after pages with nothing really going on. I ended up skipping a lot just to get to the wrap-up and I always try to be patient with less renowned writers. Maybe it is the dull writing style but this could be better as a short gay romance e-book."
1,Writing class please!!!,"OK, I admit it...I did not finish this book...I couldn't finish this book. This is the worst written book I have read in years. Every trite expression, every pathetic analogy, every overused metaphor -- and I'm only talking about the first five pages.Who publishes this stuff? Was there an editor involved? Did the editor actually read this book? Is the editor English speaking?I love the gay novel genre. It doesn't often pay off in good writing...how many Edmund Whites are there? But the work in this category can be fun; it can be evocative; it can even ring of truth.Song in the Park rings like a death knell -- for good literature.Don't buy this book."
1,"Nothing about a ""song"" OR a ""park""","This poorly, poorly edited book (to the point of distraction)should have been about 150 pages shorter, if not more. I wonder if an editor actually READ this book. It moves painfully slowly, the characters speak in stilted, unrealistic, Hallmark-card eloquence (is everyone a closet poet??) and the subplot with the serial kidnapper/killer is just flat-out ridiculous! I'm not an expert on gay fiction, but I'm sure there has got to be material better than this. I almost didn't make it through this novel. I do not and will not recommend this book to anyone. I had high hopes when I bought it and it was very disappointing. Save the $16 and stay clear of this mess."
3,Agreeing with other folks,"""Of course truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction must stick to possibilities, truth doesn't"" (Attributed to Mark Twain)I purchased this book and have picked it up twice...just because I hate to start a book and not finish it. Some plot elements are improbable (discovering one's orientation and lifelong true love at the same time). Everyone is beautiful, talented, and without character flaws. Things move along, but I found myself thinking that I really should be reading something more important or useful."
2,"Nice love story, if you can ignore the bad editing","I heard about this book from an unsolicted email sent directly from the author. It was an interesting story and read it cover to cover. It is, bar none, the victim of the worst editing (or lack of) I've ever seen. If you are not bothered by frequent and blatant editing flaws, then it IS an enjoyable story. I'm not an editor myself, but the gaffes were really obvious and distract from the continuity of the book! The author is well intentioned and perhaps his future work will be better edited.I really did enjoy the story, though."
2,"Nice collection, shoddy translation","A flat, frequently labored, sometimes dubiously punctuated translation undermines the breadth and variety of this collection. It's a shame -- Maupassant's rich, fluid, swiftly moving narrative style is unfortunately stunted. No wonder there's no sign of a translator's name (that I can locate, anyway) printed in the edition. Of course, a nice fat paperback priced under $10 is a difficult thing to spurn, but in this case it's still not quite worth the money, or the reading."
3,Beware! This is NOT about lost legions!,"This is EXACTLY the same tape as the History Channel's ""In Search of History: Roman Legions."" Don't be fooled because it has a different title and different ISBN; they are identical, down to a verbatim narrative and pictures. It is a basic, informative presentation on the Roman legions, but it is NOT, as the title implies, about the lost legions (think Teutoburgerwald or Carrhae here). Enjoy it, but don't be confused."
1,Of Limited Use,"As a student of cultural studies who is interested in limning the taxonomic and theoretical relations among the ""queer,"" the ""Asian,"" and the ""American,"" I must say that I found this book rather disappointing. Eng seems to have an unerring eye for the trivial, the irrelevant, and the beside-the-point. He also seems to be unfamiliar with current scholarship that highlights the errors underlying the view of the performative subject as a figure whose agency can, in any proper sense, be seen as ""entailed"" by virtue of its positionality vis-a-vis the rights-bearing subject. Eng would also have benefited from consulting recent legal scholarship on the ""intersectionality"" of the queer Asian male (or female), as well as the ""co-synthesis"" produced by juxtaposing various marginalized identities."
5,So cute,"The highchair arrived very quickly. It did not have instructions with it, but was very easy to assemble. I love the details and it's the perfect height for my 21/2 year old granddaughter. I would purchase this again."
1,Poor Quality Control,"My husband tried to put this high chair together for our niece's 1st birthday, however there was no way possible for this to happen! Holes were drilled on the outside of one side of the chair (when they needed to be on the inside to put it together.) The painting was also sloppy, with what looked like black, Chinese lettering painted over on the tray of the chair. All and all this was an immediate return for us. Super disappointing, as we generally have had a lot of luck with Kidkraft items for our kids."
2,Disappointing,"My mother bought this for my 3 year old, and the tray of the high chair broke off almost immediately. My husband tried to screw it back in, but it never worked right."
2,Nice at first but breaks,"This was cute and my daughter loved it at first. But, The legs started breaking after a few months and always needed pushed back together. The whole thing broke after several months or maybe a year."
5,Great and sturdy,"This is the second item I have purchased and a third I have received as a hand me down. I love the look, it doesn't look plastic, that we can keep it out and our living space doesn't look over run with brightly colored toddler toys. They are sturdy and easy to clean, I have a rambunctious and curious 2 year old that has broken many toys, of which she has yet to put a scratch on these items. Not to mention it is easy to assemble. All of her dolls fit nicely into the highchair. I definately recommend these and other items for those girls who like to play house."
5,"Super Cute, Sturdy, Great price","LOVE this high chair and we got the matching cradle as well. The ONLY complaint is that we didn't get our ""hardware"" with it. No screws/nuts/bolts so on Christmas Eve when assembling it (of course) we had to get creative. But once constructed we are happy with it. Check for hardware as soon as you receive.Also when I contacted the manufacturer directly for the missing hardware, they shipped it SAME DAY via FedEx so fantastic service. I have lots of other Kid Kraft products and I am pleased with everything."
4,Very cute high chair!,"We got this high chair for our 3.5 year old daughter for Christmas. I was agonizing because I knew time was short and we would end up putting it together on Christmas Eve...but it was a SNAP! Very happy parents. Our daughter was thrilled to have it. I even have thought about getting her another one for when her friends come over to play or if she has ""tea party"" time with several dolls. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, (really this is more of a 4.5 stars), is that her dolls tend to slide out of the seat. It would have been a nice feature to have the crotch strap for the dolls. I ended up rigging one up with velcro myself. Mommy McGyver here. Otherwise very nice purchase and very happy."
4,easy to assemble and daughter loves it,"I bought this for my 2yr old for Christmas. It is well made and was easy for Santa to assemble. Her different dolls all fit in it well and she loves it. The only drawback is that it needs a piece that separates legs on dolls. Her bitty baby 15""doll falls through under the tray because she does not have enough support. We have to make that doll do the splits and put its legs through the sides just to make her sit up in the chair. We did not want to buy a smaller chair so that the larger dolls would fit. Overall, the chair meets expectations and is played with daily."
3,Tray problem,The brackets that hold the tray on break very easly.I had to make brackets out of heavier material for this item.
5,Little mommy too,"This was purchased, along with the Lil'doll cradle for our 2 year old grand daughter. She loves playing with her ""babies"" and enjoys feeding them. While she uses this and has fun with it - the cradle gets a lot more action. It's nice that the tray lifts up to put the doll in. Seems sturdy enough."
3,Box was missing hardware,Received the high chair and the box was missing all the hardware (screws and brackets) to assemble it. Called Kidkraft hotline and requested replacement parts. Replacement hardware came one week after call and high chair was very easy to assemble in 10 minutes. High chair is cute and seems well made.
4,Beautiful chair arrived with need to repair,"This is a beautiful little high chair that I purchased as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter. It arrived with the tray separated from the arms. The nails had been hammered over and the holes painted over. Since it was Christmas eve my husband used Gorilla Glue and C-clamps to hold the tray. So far it has held. My granddaughter loves the chair and I hope it will continue to hold. However, a broken product should never have been shipped."
4,very well built,"great little high chair. Easy to put together, sturdy. My 2 year old granddaughter used it right away and put her doll in."
2,cute but didn't work,"this was attractive for me, but the lock opens (unlocks when you pull on the bar) when ANY of the numbers was on the combination number rather than when ALL 3 numbers were on the combo, so basically, it opens a third of the combinations you randomly try - so it's more a deterrent than anything."
3,A Whited Sepulcher,"I have had a Bose 3 2 1 system for about 5 years. I love the sound.But the production of TV sound is inconsistent and sometimes cuts out either completely or in part. If I reboot it or go round back and wiggle connections I can restore the sound. This has been with my old satellite system and my current Verizon FiOS system (BTW, I LOVE FiOS... but that's for another day), and with new cables and various ways of cabling sound from the set top box to the Bose (e.e., digital optical cable, RCA plugs). I have called Tech Support, I have had the system to the repair shop, and now I am on Amazon shopping for a replacement for it. Now when I listen to the Bose I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, and enough is enough.But when there is sound, it is wonderful..."
4,Who knows!,Not really sure how the product is. I received it and set it up....very easy to set up. The remote did not seem to work. Called BOSE and was told it was the receiver and that I needed to call the place of purchase. Called them and was instructed what to do with the item. RETURN IT...and then they would send me another one. GREAT! We will see in a week if I receive another one and have the same problem.
3,Not (completely) compatible with the Mac,"This appears to be a very well engineered product. Unfortunately, it is apparently not supposed to be compatible with the Mac, which I didn't determine until after I purchased it. Since a driver was not included, I went searching for one and I found one that mostly worked. The only issue was that the printer would be detected as being offline, which I could correct by popping the USB plug. When I contacted the company, they informed me that the device driver that I had found was for a display and not a printer. They pointed out that the device is not sold as Mac-compatible. I've offered to help them re-engineer the driver to work with the printer, but they have not followed-up. So I'm stuck with a device that allows me to print on the Mac my old HP Laserjet 4P, but I still have to pop the plug. Unless you are adventuresome, I would not purchase this for a Mac."
5,It worths of any penny,Saw others' reviews. Buy it and install it in a snap. My computer recognizes the legacy HP Laser Jet 4 Plus right away. It is even easier than 1-2-3.So what are you waiting for?
1,NOT AS PICTURED!!!!!!!!,"I was very disappointed to receive this product and find it not at all as depicted in photo!!! It has black tipped ends on the fur. Although in the product description it says ""twilight"" I had NO IDEA when purchasing what this meant or that it would be anything other than what was shown in the product image. I have tried to return it, but now must pay for the shipping costs back, which is half as much as the product costs."
4,more than I expected,I've had these for several months and they work great. Very strong. I use them to hang laminated calendars and pics on wall. Not sure if they will pull off paint because they are very sticky.
5,IT STICKS!,"If you need something that won't rip off at first pull, you can't beat this product! I even messed up a pair of scissors cutting these dots into smaller pieces! I love these and my class does too when they need to use velcro for projects!"
4,Great,"I thought the book, Zebra: And Other Stories was very interesting. The 6 different stories each were told very well. I recommend this book to anyone."
4,Thought Prevoking,"Chaim Potok's, book Zebra and Other Stories is very insightful. It gives us a glimpse of the complex lives of teens today. I really was able to identify with the emotions and feelings of the characters. I even felt at times as if I was a ""fly on the wall"", sneaking a peek!"
2,Repetition at it's Best,"I give credit to Chaim Potok for having the courage to write this novel, however I believe that he tried to accomplish something that is well out of his graps. He tried to firmly describe a young teenager's feelings about the world and their personal feelings, and went about it all wrong. Although, I do reccomend this book to any adult who is trying to understand teenagers, this book is an excellent first step. Granted, some of the stories are interesting, but the element of repetition is too commen. The same theme or idea or conflict is the same in the ""different"" stories. But overall, Bravo to Mr. Potok who had the courage to break new ground."
5,Magic School Bus- Grow a TickleMe Plant Too,The Magic School Bus is a great series that I use with my students. In addition each kid grows aTICKLE ME PLANT MINI GREENHOUSE KITplant and we have a garden party using TickleMe Plant Party Favors to plant our sees while reading this Magic School Bus Book.
4,Making you think about the little things (That aren't so little!),"Lillian Brown's The Polished Politician covers the basics of media relations and public image, specifically for those seeking political office.Brown, a Washington,DC-based image consultant with experience in network news and political candidate campaigns writes, ""This handbook will not resolve all of your doubts or solve many of your problems as you hit the bumps and bruses of the campaign trail....it was designed to help you...looking your best, making successful public appearances, dealing with the press and communicating your best message to get those votes.""There are probably a lot of items in the book that you will think are pretty basic, but there are things you probably need to be reminded of too.At only 87 pages, The Polished Politician gives you valuable info quickly, without a lot of fluff. Take the time to read it and you will get a few good tips to help you."
3,Racing in Saratoga,"A ""show"" for film or Harlow buffs only. Cookie cutter plot ""breezes"" along but is never ""fast"" fun. At the finish line, you're more interested in picking out Harlow's doubles than the actual movie. Gable is good (Honey, I love ya) plus it's always fun to look at the ""stable"" of MGM bit part actors. Seeing Agnes Moorehead and Frank Morgan on the train is my pick of the day! Their trip to Oz was only a few years away.Watching Harlow is a good ""bet"" too due to some eerie lines (Goodbye and I could just die) so this makes Saratoga a curio in itself. However, this movie isn't a ""winner"" but more an also-ran. Lionel Barrymore finishes strong with some good lines but it's Una Merkel who comes home the winner: We women can do things to a man we love that men wouldn't do to a rattlesnake."
3,Does as Advertised,"I have a Jeep and use this hoister to remove the hardtop during summer months. It does its job and my top is yet to fall on my Jeep, so it works."
2,don't like the fit,Don't like the fit and the space for your toes is too small. I have small feet and the shoe fit but the toes were not covered. The shoes might cover if you have bigger feet then a 6 because the toe area might be bigger.
1,Don't buy this. Get the DVD instead,Incredibly poor quality. Extremely grainy. I should have sent them back. Ended up not watching them at all after the first tape. Still in their cello on my shelf. Watched the DVDs when they came out.
3,pure curiosity kept this series alive,"Twin Peaks was already losing steam long before the 20thepisode [but]I couldn't help but watch to see where Lynch would go with it. Lynch's murder mystery started off with a terrific bang that created so much interest you couldn't help but continue watching. The last episodes tend to be a bit over the top, but it is worth watching atleast once."
3,Missing Beard,"Description clearly states:""This child size Santa suit costume set includes a jacket, pants, hat, beard, belt and boot tops.""Received today and there is no beard."
5,Sppoky and beautiful,"This is a beautiful CD. Sarah Fimm's piano playing is soothing and spooky at the same time. Her voice is lilting but strong, airy but gutsy. I don't really know whom to liken her to, perhaps a spookier Tori Amos...maybe a little Terami Hirsch and Portishead thrown in. Part ""girl and piano"" and one part techno. But really quite original. .It's evident that Fimm is fond of the voice over as she uses this technique in several songs, all very effectively.This CD covers a lot of styles very well. It's all atmospheric and ambient, but you'll find dabs of jazz, blues, rock, cabaret, and pop too.If you like this kind of music you'll love this CD.(read full review at collectedsounds.com)"
2,Adjustment screws don't hold,"I adjusted the light at about a 45 degree angle upwards from vertical, and after a few minutes I noticed that it had ""adjusted itself"" to a 90 degree horizontal angle (the light face was horizontal with the beam pointing straight up). I adjusted it back and tried tightening the 2 screws holding the light to the frame, and the plastic thumbscrew covers turned, but the screws didn't actually tighten (the covers just rotated around the screws). The screws don't hold the heavy light head at any angle but vertical. I will replace the plastic covered screws with standard ones, but now I have to use a nut-driver or screwdriver to adjust the angle of the light. Professional quality? I think not.Update - replacing the screws was easy, and it now holds its position when adjusted."
2,Disappointed,"The Whynter Sno 1200 seems to work well enough, at least at first. Soon, however, my wife and I noticed that it was very loud and given to periodic humming or ""sighing"" over and above the noise of the compressor. This additional noise makes it very hard to sleep when the maching's compressor is running.Also noticed that the machine seems to have a hard time bringing down the temperature in our room which measures 15 X 15. It gets the job done eventually but taken up to 4 hourse to bring the temp down from 80 to 74 degrees.Emails to the compan y have proven unresponsive even though CSR assured me that was the best way to report these problems. I would definitely not recommend this product."
2,A bit let down...,"The unit arrived on time and in full working order. It is rather bulky, and must be near a window for the purpose of ventilation, something which was not made real clear in the advertising. That limits its ""portability"" from my perspective. I could have bought a window unit for about half the price if I had known that beforehand. The unit is also a bit louder than a window unit, and makes sleeping rather difficult when it is on. While rated at 12,000 BTU, it seems to cool as if it were a 5,000 BTU unit."
2,Dissapointed!,"I received this costume in a timely manner, although the costume pictured was NOT the costume I received. Even the image printed on the bag that the costume was in was identical to the one seen here, though the actual costume used a black ""pleather"" material rather than the light brown (around ears, feet, and cuffs). I tried it on my daughter and the tail dragged and she tripped on it, the feet were just plain scary looking, and the ears would not stand up as seen in the picture.-In an attempt to return this merchandise I have tried calling a couple of times, one of which I waited on hold for 31 minutes, and was then hung up on.*******Definately not worth the price!********"
4,Great Book for Beginners - Perfecto para principiantes!,"Great book for beginners, it explains in details (and in 2 languages to boot) the in's and out's of a computer. Perfect for those that are clueless when it comes to the ""harware"" of the computer. It gives you a great base to start with.Un libro perfecto para principiantes, detalladas explicaciones que ayudan a saber como se llaman todos los componentes de la computadora, especialmente si la persona es bilingue o esta aprendiendo el Ingles."
3,So-so and cheaper at Walmart!,"I purchased this item on this website. Then I saw it at Walmart for nearly $10 less!! My daughter played with it for about three days and that was it. It can only do so many things, which was a lot of fun initially but it's not going to take your child long to get tired of it. The same thing happens over and over and that is just plain dull after the first few times. Hopefully she will play with it again after she's ""forgotten"" about it."
3,Stable workhorse,"Does what's advertised. Picture quality and sound is fine, no problems with this unit so far after 2 years."
2,not worth the money,"I don't understand why but this new blade doesn't work any better then the old blade. It did work fine for 1 haircut, but the next time I tried to use them, they were back to the way the old blades worked, or should I say, didn't work. Tried several times to lubricate them while cutting, which ended up making my dog covered in oil, but the hair just wouldn't cut.I won't buy this product again. Next time, I will just take my dogs to a groomer."
2,Looks good but damaged when delivered.,"It was delivered damaged. Several visible scratches and a major dent. To much trouble to repack and return, but wanted to warn others to check before deliver so you do no accept and return it. For me it was to late"
2,Nice frame..terrible delivery,"I really liked the looks of the bed frame and thought metal would make it durable and nice looking for years. To my amazement, it was delivered damaged. Several scratches and a couple of major dents, one highly visible. Won't try to repackage and return, but wanted to warn others."
3,Chris Gore's Original Underrated Classic!,"The Bum Bar Bastards (Jim Davidson & John Elmo) started prank calling the owner of the Tube Bar, Louis ""Red"" Deutsch back in 1975. The calls were passed around as a bootleg tape and became famous purely by accident. Today they are legendary and known as the originators of prank phone calls and are unmatched by any other and are pure classic.Chris Gore got a copy of the tape (before the BBBs came forward) and decided it would make a great short film. It's nice to see the video along w/ the calls (which is unique and rare) and anyone would hold heartedly agree that Legendary Actor ""Lawrence Tierney"" plays the perfect Red.This film is rare and hard to find, but has recently been remastered in 16.9 WideScreen and re-released on the Tube Bar 35th AnniversaryTube Bar Prank Calls 35th Anniversary Complete Collection [DVD+CD] Dolby/DTS. If you can find this classic I reccomend buying it."
1,Horrid Instrument,"What I got is a veneered P.O.S. that only after a new sound post, new bow, and new strings, (plus a little filing in the nut) sounds half way descent. I recommend that you pay the piper, and spend a little more for an instrument that actually works"
2,Dribbles,"Kinda small, pretty, fits in tight spaces, dribbles. If you want something small and pretty and you don't mind spilling a little every time you pour, this may be the pitcher for you."
4,Loved it. Very Revealing.,"I read this years ago, and it left quite an impression; many suspicions regarding television's workings were confirmed, and I learned some sad truths as well. However, I wasn't left with the same impression as the person in the Kirkus Review quoted above: television's quality rising and falling not so much in response to governmental regulation and deregulation, but more so from the forces behind those states of regulation/deregulation--corporations, their commercial influence and impact. To leave that out is to have overlooked quite a significant element in the story. The message conveyed by these two veterans of the industry, now in their elder years and so with nothing to lose (and perhaps even a compulsion to confess all in a manner they could not in earlier years) being the deleterious impact of excessive corporate influence. I enjoyed this book so much for its wealth of inside information and generally juicy reading that I'm ordering it again."
3,"A good account, but not quite complete","Exploring television's history, these authors suggest that the downfall of television programming is a result of both government regulation and deregulation. They offer hope that television will improve. This book offers historical perspective. I would like to have seen more on other First Amendment abuses."
5,It's a sad and beautiful world,"I've listened to this album at least once a week for the past 4 years. Her lovely voice, filled with melancholy (and the occasional flash of hope), fits perfectly in amongst sigur ros and Johann Johannsson when I'm feeling like crawling under a blanket to escape all this hideousness. ""Inadequate response"" and ""And then we stopped breathing"" are my personal favorites, but there isn't a bad track on here."
5,story tellers,"the book completes the story told in the film. film is part 1 and the book is part 2 of some kind of monster.**I saw megadeth live on april 3rd, 2005. obviously the story goes on."
5,FOR ANYONE!!!,"Although the book is obviously for Metallica fans, the book goes in depth about human beings and their struggles. As many did, I got the book for Christmas and I am not a big reader. To my surprise I tore through the book and finshed it in a week. A must for a metallica fan but could also catch the interest of those who enjoy looking into other peoples lives and see the human side of what today people call ""Rock stars"" and ""celebrities"". Awesome book with humor, suspense, and raw human emotion. GREAT BOOK!!!"
2,Too Touchy - Feely,"This book, as it says on the cover, is the inside story of the hit film ""Metallica: Some Kind of Monster"". Q Prime, Metallica's management company, hired a ""performance-enhancement coach"" by the name of Phil Towle to conduct therapy sessions with the remaining members. The thing I find most annoying about it are the constant references to the past projects of the film maker. I expected a book that was about Metallica and instead got something that is full of self referencial drivel and soul searching from Joe. Perhaps it's my fault and my expectations were set incorrectly, but I found the book to be quite boring overall. Phil Towle, tries to get James & Lars to hug whenever they seIf I wanted to read a book about learning to trust someone, I would have picked up Dr. Phil's latest book."
2,"More Metallica, less Joe please","The book is mildly interesting. The thing I find most annoying about it are the constant references to the past projects of the film maker. I expected a book that was about Metallica and instead got something that is full of self referencial drivel and soul searching from Joe. Perhaps it's my fault and my expectations were set incorrectly (by me), but I found the book to be quite boring overall. Hope the DVD is better."
2,Who is this book about?,"Caution to those who want to read about Metallica (you won't get to with this book). Like others I was disappointed when I started to read this book and found out that soooo much of it was about the director and not Metallica.To be fair, I think I know what the author was trying to do. By correlating his experiences and struggles to what Metallica was going through; he tried to show that they have problems just like any normal ""Joe"". The problem is though, I was not expecting that and kept waiting for more about Metallica.The book is well written and if you are a Berlinger AND Metallica fan, then you will fall in love with this book."
2,Too self-serving,"The book let me down in a lot of ways. I guess it just wasn't what I had expected. I was hoping for an inside account of how Metallica wrote the lyrics and created the music in a collaborative effort inside their studios (which is the opposite of how they created their prior albums). Instead I got a book that was 50% of the author patting himself on the back of his previous projects and how Blair Witch 2 was a bomb. Honestly, I don't care. I wanted to hear stories about Metallica, not get a run down of your resume."
3,confusion,"If you decide to read this book, get ready to be reading the same poem over and over again. It is hard to understand at first, which is why my first impression of it was bad, but once you understand it, it's a pretty decent book of poems. The only odd part about it is it's random story in the middle. So I say,if you like Erdrich, you'll like the book."
5,The man who just didnt care,"This is one of the most interesting books ihave read in yrs, Ray garmon must have excellent writing skills to write a book with so much mystery of how a man can go from one way of life to just the opposite, really couldnt read it fast enough to get to see how thrilling and intriguing the ending was, really must congratulate mr garmon for writing this book , should be on the top sellers list in my opinion,"
2,Not my cup of tea...,"Let me first say, I tried. However, it was just too raw for me to get past the first three chapters. Foul language, depressingly cruel characters, and a very negative outlook about people and life in general just keep me from wanting to pick it up again. I admit that I'm curious as to whether the ""hero"" ever learns to care, but the description doesn't seem to encourage me that this might happen. While I know there is a lot of depravity floating around, I just don't feel like wallowing in it. Sorry, Ray."
5,JUST PEACHY!,"This book is packed with tons of information on 5ive. All of which is the real stuff, unlike 5ive my Anna Louise Golden. I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes 5ive. It is easy to read, and easy to not read if you just wanna go through and pick out little facts about the guys."
3,Weak AC,"It doesn't even cool off a small room. When adjusting the temperature, it does not go below 71 degrees. It is just not a powerful machine. The only positive feature is the remote control. We use our A/C along with a ceiling fan and the room is still not cool."
2,more like a fan,This air conditioner does not cool a bedroom more than 10 degrees b/l the outside temperature; it also significantly raises the power bill.
2,Good for very small spaces,the airconditioner was a good buy for the first 3 days and now we cant get it to cool off to any degree below 77.
2,"Not so ""Ultra Quiet""!","We purchased 2 of these because it seemed like a great deal and we figured Haier would make a good product. I wish we had only purchased one first to try. We installed one so far, in a very small bedroom. It is very loud. We had an Emerson Quiet Cool in all bedrooms before this and they are MUCH quieter. The other issue is that you have to use the remote to change settings. There's no way to do it manually, so if the battery dies on your remote, you can only turn it on or off. I gave it two stars because it does keep the small space relatively cool. I also chose this model because of the energy rating, but after reading the other reviews, I'm worried about that too---we'll see. Would not recommend this product with all the other options out there. Probably returning the second one."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD Haier DO NOT BUY!!!","Do not buy from this maker. They do not work at all and to top it off the unit that was in the box was not what was described on the outside of the box. Based upon the outside of the box, my unit was supposed to have 4 funtions - it came out of the box with only 2. It was supposed to have 3 fan speeds and it came out of the box with only 2. It is a glorified fan - does not cool past 81 degrees. The company does not back their product and told me that they are packed in China and that Haier is not responsible for what happens in China. Go with another maker unless you are just wanting to have a headache."
1,Never again,"I was so happy when I came across this set. All my favorite classic movies.....wrong. The quality is so bad on every movie, the sound fades completely out for up to 10 minutes at a time, and when it comes back, you can hardly hear it. I would not recommend this set to anyone. This is a perfect example of ""Too good to be true."""
4,Nice challenge for very young puzzlers.,"Its difficult to find wooden puzzles like this for toddlers. This one is a challenge for children, but my 1 1/2 year old needed something harder than the peg puzzles. When he does this puzzle, he does it over and over. I think this one is more challenging for him than the train puzzle by the same company, but he does really enjoy the challenge. There is some wear on the puzzle in only six months of use, but no splinters. Just some cracks and minor paint chip wear.The description makes it seem as if the tray is something cool -its just a red cardboard part of the packaging, in my opinion. No reason to mention that it comes with this tray ... it went straight to recycle bin."
4,Powerful and telling,"I had the privilege of performing the stage version of this novel twice (I played Amy), and it was a life-changing experience every time we stepped onto the stage. I probably have a bit more personal insight into the story, having both read the novel and performed the play, and the characters are as dear to me as real people. The story isn't perfect, but it's very good. The characters are flawed, likeable, varied, pleasantly non-cookie-cutter. This isn't a feel-good story, but it's a story that awakens our deepest fears and doubts, and tests the ""what if's"" of our faith. This isn't a story of ""if this ever happens"", it's a story of ""WHEN this happens"". Putting yourself in the place of these characters is a challenge every Christian should face."
5,excellent service,"product in excellent condition, great price, got here super duper fast. I loved it! I ordered a cd from a different provider, the same day that I ordered this one, and still waiting for my other order, you guys did great! thanks!!!"
4,Get his latest work first,I came to this page using Latin Pop Essential List link to start the collection. You may start your collection with this album if you are 12 years old and younger. Listen to this artist's latest album first.
4,Ms. Murrey has the ability to surpass Stephen King...eerie..,Mary Murrey's novel was very well written and had a constant flow in plot and mystery... you either like this novel and get into it or despise it and refuse to read it... I chose to read this book because of the author's excellent writing ability:) She will be one of the author's I look for in the future...!!
5,Glad I took a chance.,"I have to say that I'm usually pretty cautious about buying off brand, generic, no-name stuff. However, I had an old 1 Gig CF card that was slow as molassis in my Canon G6. With the old card I could take three or four pictures at the slow continuous repeating frame rate, about 1 every 0.8 seconds I think, before the card slowed it down to about 1 every 2.5 or so seconds.This card lets me take about a dozen or more before that happens, which is great.So, it's definitely faster. I don't know what 60x speed is versus my old card, but I'd guess it's at least 10 times faster.I've shot about 200 pictures with it, and only filled it up about 30% at a time. I've written about 2 gigs to it total, just not at once. I've had zero problems with it so far.So, for a little over half as much as the high speed 2 gig name brand cards, I'd recommend trying one.Remember, all manufacturers have a failure rate, and we don't know what these guy's failure rate is yet."
4,"It was haunting,unforgettable,and at the end,heart-breaking","While Dusk Before Dawn was not as instantaneously engrossing as its predeccesor, Everlasting,it did become more compelling in the second half.The mystical denoument was tragic and memorable, although I did feel a bit cheated since the terminal sentence of Everlasting promised that Beth and Lachlan would be around for a ""very long time."" Ironically,I found Laura more intriguing when she was possessed by her demonic alter-ego Tessa. The deep friendship between Roan and Lachlan was touching and very moving."
2,Amatuer Hour Flatware Tray,There are yellow stains in the spots they glued. This is noticeable. If gross yellow glue stains bother you avoid this.
4,"NICE WAY TO ORGANIZE, SLIGHT CRACK","THIS MAKES IT EASY TO ORGANIZE SILVERWARE IN THE DRAWER IN A NEAT AND ATTRACTIVE WAY. ONLY PROBLEM THAT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL IS THAT IS CAME WITH A CRACK. IT MAKES IT ALITTLE LESS ATTRACTIVE, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO EFFECT THE STABILITY OF IT. I DON'T KNOW IF I'D TRUST TO ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER BECAUSE I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHOULD BE CHECKED BEFORE IT'S SHIPPED. KIND OF MAKES YOU NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT."
1,Not for MacIntosh Users,"The Author and Amazon's descriptions do not inform you up front that this is a WINTEL application book. In addition, the Author rambles in her explainations and the narative is cluttered with technicl asides that confuse the beginning user.The Author would benefit from an exposure to ""Information Mapping"" Techniques in presenting her explaination of Quicken 98.This is an excellent example of delibitating wordiness."
2,KISS,"New to digital photography, I assumed all CompactFlash cards were the same, and since the Lexar card included a fairly generous rebate offer, I purchased it. Alas, it's not compatible with the Sandisk reader and program that I purchased with my camera. It comes with its own reader and cable, but who wants to keep alternating cables in the USB port? I'm returning it and sticking with Sandisk until all of these competing formats and manufacturers get their act together."
5,The Bible comes alive!!!,"To be able to see the prophencies in the Bible being fulfilled thru this type of video is truly remarkable and astounding, I highly recomend it for all who want to know if the Bible is real or not"
2,Awesome When it worked,"I first bought this Burner about a year ago, I had many problems with the software bundel it came with when wanting to burn mp3's on to a cd-r. Finally, a few months after I purchased it I bought Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4.0, after buying this I loved my burner. But after about 6 months the power supply failed and it won't even turn on. I have tried to get it repaired they say there is nothing they can do so my 300 dollars went down the drain. This is a very good product if you want to replace it every 6 months. Now mine is just a paper weight."
3,read Sherman Alexie's review,"I think those interested in understanding the issues this book addresses, or doesn't address, might want to read American Indian author Sherman Alexie's thought provoking review of this book on his website."
3,Good but strange,"Frazier is a talented writer and there are some very moving passages in ""On the Rez."" But like some of his other books, this is a sort-of rambling patchwork without much of a unifying theme or narrative. He jumps around from one story about life on Pine Ridge to the next. And what caused me a little discomfort in reading this was Frazier's relationship with Le War Lance. They refer to each other as friends, but frankly, they seem more like two men who are using each other. From Le War Lance, Frazier gets ""material"" for his book and a certain amount of legitimacy as a visitor on the reservation. From Frazier, Le War Lance gets money to buy beer and auto parts, and free rides in Frazier's car. The facts that Frazier always stays in a motel when visiting the rez, and that he basically kicks Le out of his house when Le shows up unannounced & drunk on his doorstep one day, say something about the true nature of their relationship."
4,Enlightening,"The story of the up and down friendship between a native American on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and a white man from the city. Frazier also writes about local heroes, the ongoing problems with alcoholism and poverty, the persistence of spiritual faith."
2,Not quite accurate.,"It's an interesting view of the Pine Ridge reservation of South Dakota ... if you aren't concerned with accuracy. His account of Ms. Big Crow's shawl dance at the Lead Basketball game has been discounted by most attendants at the game, including her cousin that he quoted for most of the events. His scathing attack on Lead and its supposed racism seems all the more unwarranted when taken in the context that the story is untrue. His short, and inaccurate account, of the flood damage in Rapid City (Main Street was literally untouched by the 1972 flood) adds to the doubts of this reader on what information is or isn't on the money. It is interesting, but necessary to take with a grain of salt. I very much wanted to learn from this book, but was afraid of the inaccuracies I was learning."
4,"Don't ""Rez""ist it","Frazier's book details the life of the Oglala Sioux on the Pine Ridge reservation. The story mixes past with present, as Frazier follows the life of his friend Le War Lance. He details the battles with alcoholism and racism that Native Americans face today. He also examines that hope that exists for these people living in desperate conditions.Most importantly the book is not boring while providing useful information. You can actually enjoy reading it and learn something useful in the process."
5,Eye opener,"I originally bought this book just to get the Super Savings on shipping and needed something to put me over the $25 mark for my order. I got it, put it to the side and forgot about it for a few months. Eventually I realized I was going home and playing video games every day and needed some help on how to improve my liesure time. I was really impressed with this book, and it has changed my thinking that way that Office Space or Fight Club can have an effect on your typical viewpoint. Although repetitive at points, it really drives home the desire to improve the quality of your life based on what you want, not what the world wants you to want."
5,Thank God I'm not the only one,"Found this in Powell's on a trip to Portland. Thought it was satire. Picked it up, and was astounded. Spent my time from that evening through my shuttle to the airport and half my flight home the next day.I mean, WOW! The biggest, bestest part is: he really does start from the proposition that you want out of full-time employment, and THEN he concentrates on how you have a genuinely good life in ways that have nothing to do with what most workers think of as ""leisure""."
2,"Good, but not worth the price","This book is interesting and had some very good points, but not worth the price I paid. It is more philosophically orientied than practically - bad. This book is far cry from How to Survive Without a Salary by Charles Long or Living Well on Practically Nothing.Read these books first."
4,Help in priority setting,This is a good reference source to make one think about what is important and how to use free time wisely..and how to have fun!
4,Encouraging,"This is not just about retiring or making the most of being unemployed (in fact, unemployment is hardly mentioned until halfway into the book). It is about determining what you want to do with your life and what makes you happy (which is often not related to working). It helps you prioritize your life without being obvious about it -- looking at what you like (e.g., follow your heart) and what you are gifted with.Although the author was younger at the time, he has many excellent points and clearly has practiced what he preaches. Too often, people write books or take a one or two year ""exercise"" and write a book about it -- only to turn away from that.The book was an easy, entertaining and life-redirecting read."
4,Getting the Most Out of Your Life,"I found The Joy of Not Working a fantastic read. It is full of advice, stories and excercises on bettering the quality of your life. It focuses on valuing your time - nurturing interests and talents that may have been ignored because of society's focus on working hard to make a lot of money. It is inspiring and talks about such topics as: putting money in perspective, getting the most out of your spare time, finding out what is really important to you, enjoying your own company, introspection, not wasting time worrying, along with many other topics. I highly recommend this book for those who feel a bit empty about what mainstream society deems important in life and want to search for a more meaningful life."
1,"Without a doubt, one of the worst books I have ever read.","Self-help ideals without any substance to back it up. He titles chapters such as ""Financial independence on less than twenty dollars a day"" and then never gets around to telling the reader just how one would do that. If you want to learn how to be a happy street person, this is the book for you."
2,"Lacking on the ""How To"" part....","This book opened my eyes even wider to the negative impact being apart of the rat race has on one's mental and physical health. Zelinksi's advice on engaging in recreational activites and minimizing debt is worth following. However, what this book lacks is in depth knowledge about ""how to"" really survive or live on very little money when one has given up the rat race for self discovery in the meantime.Many Americans believe that this ""Life of Riley"" way of living is impossible to achieve because a lot of money is required for everything here, especially healthcare! I used to think the same way until I read the following book...""Living Well on Practically Nothing"" by Edward Romney is a true instruction manual for people who either don't make enough money from their jobs, are retired or unemployed. An excellent book! The title really says it all."
4,A good reminder work is not all there is to life,"Perhaps a bit too ""evangelical"" in its delivery for me, but a good read and a good reminder that work does not need to be the be-all and end-all of one's life. While it is particularly directed to those about to retire, those overworked or those unemployed, those over-it-all like me get some great pointers too. As someone contemplating a shift, but scared to make a move, this book was useful in giving me ideas to act on now as well as some confirmation that a change for the better can happen. A good and necessary corrective to the endless materialistic messages given to us in our consumerist society."
5,"The Joy of Not Working: A Book for the Retired, Unemployed and Overworked- 21st Century Edition","I have read several books on retirement, and this is by far the best. It helps you lay out a realistic road map of activities for your retirement years."
5,The Joy of Not Working,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've long thought that working for someone else was highly overrated and am happy to see that the author agrees with me. I especially enjoyed Chapter 10, It Is Better To Be Alone Than in Bad Company. I known so many people over the years who think that 'alone' and 'lonely' are the same thing. They're not. In any case, this book was a fun read and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,amazing,"One of the few eloquint and intelligent writers of present day. Wade Davis mixes art and life into a wonderful collage of sights, sounds and drug induced visions. Totally engrossing and one of the best books I have ever read."
5,Another Great CD from Kelly,"""What I Deserve"" is one of my all-time favorite CD's, so I was really looking forward to ""Easy"". After listening to it a few times, I can honestly say that Kelly has put together another great collection of songs, many of which she wrote. This album is a little more somber than the last. Her voice is as unique and beautiful and ever. Kelly and husband Bruce Robison are two of the most talented, yet under-appreciated musicians in country music."
5,an ez classic!,"Kelly Willis croons a classc set of mellow, heart-weary, soul-searching countrified gems.Five stars all the way!"
2,Not easy at all,"When Kelly Willis first came on the scene in the early 90's, I was absolutely taken with her beautiful voice mixed with raw honky-tonk sounds; it just seemed right. Maybe she's getting older, maybe motherhood has changed her, or maybe she just doesn't care anymore. In any case, this is one lousy album that never ends. I've often encountered slow starting albums, and those that take a dozen or so replays to grow on you, but this one is just plain boring. I cant hear any enthusiasm, and any country influence is gone? I guess if you're a middle-aged, white, run-of-the mill, affluent, soccer-mom, this album may be your sort of thing. Reminds me of something I'd hear in a Boston or Hartford Coffee House with folks wearing LL Bean sitting around discussing suburban yard keeping or Martha Stewart; moreso than what I'd hear in a beer joint or diner in Texas or Kentucky among the working class. To each his own, but this is not fare for the blue collar or calloused-hand folks."
5,Miss Kelly a great country singer,"Tex's commentsMiss Kelly,I think has a very beautiful voice and can sing verywell.She is also is my favorite female country western singer"
4,a unique and touching artist,"an intensely soulful, passionate and moving work that gives one hope for the younger artists working in country. Ms Willis' sound is a lovely contribution to the world of music. It's intelligent and deftly avoids the usual commercial trappings.Catching her live when she opened for The Indigo Girls was a rare treat."
2,Easy Does It,"Pretty woman. Pretty voice. Pretty dull. In my humble opinion, her earlier albums are a lot more interesting to listen to. I'd recommend ""Kelly Willis"" as the best one. If you want a little more twang, then ""Bang, Bang"" is the way to go."
1,what we don't deserve,"maybe my expectations were too high. ""what i desrve"" was a great record, as were the others. but, the songs are an uneven mix and it seemd it trys too hard. i've been a Kelly Willis fan for years, the other records seemed to border on a style all of it's own , this is just pure country. i'll file this one away."
2,Easy...A Little Too Easy,"Kelly Willis's seductive voice and the silky-smooth, bluegrass-tinged arrangements make EASY an easy listen, to be sure. But, as Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, there is little ""there"" there. Nothing on this CD stands out, the tempo and arrangements all sound like one another. Fans of the oh-so-soft bluegrass stylings of Allison Krauss or Nickel Creek may appreciate the arrangements here. On the other hand, those who like a little oomph in their country will find something missing. And, going where angels fear to tread, Willis's cover of Kirsty MacColl's ""Don't Come the Cowboy..."" pales in comparison to the original. If you are going to rely on easy arrangements, best you stick with easy material too..."
3,Why are pushpins shipped separately?,"We recently ordered four items from Amazon.com, with free shipping advertised. It turned out only two of the items were shipped free, and the other two shipped separately, with excessive shipping costs. These $1.98 pushpins cost over $5 to ship! We will not order from Amazon again."
4,Not 100 in pack.,"Did not look like 100, there was 53 in the box...LIES. ALL LIES. All kidding aside, I just needed tacks and these were the tacks I expected."
1,Not sure what to say,"I bought this book because my family is from the area that this is supposedly based on. I have read about half of the stories and frankly, I just don't get it. It's like random thoughts written in story form and each one has basically left me scratching my head, wondering what it was about. Certainly not worth the money I paid but I knew it was a risk when I bought it. Don't bother."
3,Entertaining but not strong on the concept of sharing,I bought this video specifically to help me teach my two year old the concept of sharing. This video is not strong in this area. There are a couple of references to it but the video is primarily concerned with entertaining (which it does a fine job of). I just expected more on the title subject. If he must watch something then it might as well be this! Just don't expect a teaching video.
3,"This show is cute, but not necessarily all about sharing.","This show is broadcasted on the PBS series of ""Barney & Friends"" as ""Who's who on the choo choo?"" This is a more appropriate title for this show. It is a cute show, but if you are looking for a show about sharing, ""Caring means Sharing"" or ""What a world we share."" Would be better. This show is about trains, and it is entertaining--especially to little boys. My younger brother calls this show ""Train Barney."" It includes the characters: Barney, Baby Bop, BJ, Tosha, Juan, Kenneth, and Julie. And some of the songs featured in this show are: The Marching Song, Little Red Caboose, Down by the station, and I've been workin' on the railroad. This is a cute show, and my brothers both enjoy it very much, but if you are looking for a show about sharing--this is it."
3,"Good video, but no education in sharing","This was a good video, however it doesn't have any education in sharing in my opinion. B.J. and Baby Bop make a circus train inside the classroom and Baby Bop suggests that they take turns being the conductor and engineer. My request is that the company who makes this video should put in some education in sharing. Barney, Julie, Kenneth, Juan, Tosha, B.J., and Baby Bop get a surprise visit from Stella the Storyteller at the end of the video. She tells a story to the children about a generous little engine that was very good at helping and sharing. See if your child learns to share from this video."
5,"I Loved ""The Art People Love""","I loved this book. Such a variety of resources for sculpting. The great illusions and texture were fantastic, and its not just because I am related to this fantastic artist- it's just that I LOVE his art!!!"
5,I Love Tyler Candles,"I am so happy to have the Tyler Candles available online at Amazon. I had a shop near me which used to sell them and unfortunately, they went out of business.I bought the Fleur De Lis which is an absolutely beautiful smelling candle. I also love French Market, Icon and Diva.The great thing about these candles is how well their aroma travels throughout the house."
5,magical delight!!,"this A&E production is all about the lovely & clever scheherazade & her 1,001 nights of tales-it delves into the origins of aladdin & his lamp, ali baba & the 40 theives, the original magic carpet rides, etc.-the video is beautiful & intelligently done, but perhaps a bit too sensuous for small children-"
1,not good,really not good my son wear it one time and all sewing disjointed in less then one hours. he was very sad
3,Sold in 2 pair???,"I bought these gloves as a Christmas gift for a 9 year old girl. I haven't given them to her yet, but I have taken them out of the package. They appear to be of nice quality. They are nice, heavy gloves, and she wanted them to work in the barn on her animals. I believe they will serve her purpose.My question is...the advertisement for the gloves indicates ""2 pair."" In the description below, it indicates the gloves are sold in 2 pair. I only received one pair. Now, while I thought $7.97 for 2 pairs of gloves was too good to be true, I feel the headline for the product should be changed as it is misleading. It should say ""2 gloves"" and not ""2 pair."" Or am is missing something?Otherwise, as always, I'm happy with my purchase from Amazon.com."
3,Way too big,"I bought these knowing I ran the risk of them being too big for my 3yr old. They were indeed too large. On the plus size the fit my wife who is 5'3""."
3,Good product for 7+ year olds,"Gloves are good. However, my son is 5 1/2 and the gloves are too large for him. I could never find any guidance on age for them, so I'm disappointed by that. But they'll be waiting when he's a little older."
4,Worth the money,"The bed is nicely made. The manufacturer put stickers on the posts that didn't want to come off. I ended up just putting them against the wall side so they wouldn't show. As a seller, I wouldn't have used a type of sticker that won't easily peel off furniture. Also, some beds have a removable ladder. This one is made that you HAVE to screw it in to attach to the bed, so it's pretty permanent. Other than that, it looks good and went together easily. Definitely worth the money..."
2,The clamp sucks!,"Trailer is just fine. The clamp stinks because it keeps coming loose (trust me, I've put as much torque on it as my fingers can stand). Also, the clamp placement on the chainstay is too far forward. It contacts my heel and my wife's heel on her bike. The only remedy is to ride with the arch of the foot on the pedal, which is wrong.I'm converting it to a hub mounted attachment, using a Burley skewer mounted bracket and altering the attachment method. Then, it will be out my way!The kids love riding in it, it's light enough and has large wheels for the bumps. I do like the options for covering the babes with the front mesh, or plastic cover.It's just the clamp that sucks!"
1,"Bought it yesterday, returning it tomorrow","I bought this from a local bike shop. I'm thankful so that I can return it more easily. As I was assembling it I noticed that one velcro strap that was supposed to be sewed on was not. No big deal, an easy fix.However, once I had it assembled I went to attach it to my bike. The clamp looked like it was falling apart on the first attachment, and once I climbed aboard my foot hit the clamp on every stroke unless I pedaled with the middle of my foot. I figured it may have just been my Mountain Bike, but it did the same thing on my Road Bike.For reference, I wear size 12 shoes, above average but not unusual.My wife enjoyed it on her bike (end of the driveway and back) but we didn't pay $220 for something that only one of us can enjoy. It will be back at the store tomorrow."
1,I wouldn't recommend it,"This trailer does look great but it is poorly made. Just after one season of using it the cloth straps have torn which results in no seat belts and no back support. If you do decide to buy this I would HIGHLY recommend that you keep it indoors at all times when not in use, and try to store it in a bag to help prolong the cheap materials."
2,It works but has issues,"This trailer has basically been functional. However, as has been noted, the clamp that attaches the trailer to the bike frame is very weak. It has a plastic component that wore out for us within a year and I've had to play with to make functional again. You'd expect better parts or design for the price of the vehicle.There is also no proper brake on this thing. Highly inconvenient.Otherwise, it does sit two children quite well, and rides fairly easily. If I'd spend the money again I'd buy a different trailer, however."
2,OK Carriage Awful Clamp,"My kid (and dog) love riding in the carriage but with the screen pulled over they have limited visibility and they often get hot.That is actually manageable but the clamp is a total disaster. They actually used plastic to hold the bolt. Well, the plastic stripped in about a day and now I have to use a wrench to tighten the thing down. Of all places to NOT use plastic.Anyway-There are better carriages with better clamps that will save you a ton of time."
1,very very bad because never recive,never buy again en amazon because never recive and call seand imal and no recive inseertplis no buy more in this place
5,Why is this out of print? Why isn't there a movie?,"Seriously, we have dozens of other parodies as films, where is Miaowara Tomokato blood soaked tale of revenge? A wonderful example of a wonderful series of books."
3,Definitely tattoo history...,"A good DVD, but even though titled under History, had hoped that there was just more surrounding more current tattoo 'showing', info, skills, art, etc. - i.e., what the historical then evolved to. Talks about where tattoos were first created thousands of yrs ago (apprx :)), how they were done, where they started, different countries, etc.. It's not a long DVD - 50 minutes - so doing all that, not much time for the current stuff - just a short section at the end...If you're into the history, this is it; not for the stuff today...Had to laugh - if you're curious, you can actually get 27 New - some for 10 cents!!"
1,Tinny-Sounding -- Returned It,"Bought subject analog phone based on pretty good reviews. Despite trying various strategies, such as hitting the option to search for clearer channels, the clarity of incoming conversations was very, very bad. Returned it after about two weeks of frustration. Did get excellent service from Electronic Express (Amazon's distributor) in the return process, so 5 stars for the distributor. The phone was out of stock, so they're returning our payment, and the pickup by FedEx was no-cost to us."
1,You Have GOT to Be Kidding,"I thought this book was a brilliant parody of those humorless, doctoral-thesis tomes on pop culture . . . But no, Hirschman seems to be serious. VERY serious.She offers us deadpan pyscho-social, mytho-based treatises on Laverne and Shirley, The Beverly Hillbillies, Murphy Brown, etc. At one point she actually presents us with the sentence, ""Laura Petrie also represents, of course, the Good Mother/Nurturant Goddess archetype.""At that point, I shot myself."
4,Fantastic... but there is another,"This pad is excellent, no mistake there. I have played on everything from the cheap pads that you find on eBay to an Ignition 2.0 pad to this. It's much better than the 2.0, but some people will be put off by its price. It has good durability and supports heavier players than a normal pad.However, there is a better one. Cobalt Flux makes one product and one product alone, a supreme metal pad that goes for 300. If you are serious about DDR, then there is no other than the Colbalt.I have used both and seen what happens to both pads over time, and there are replaceable parts that cobalt has, but it seems that the redoctane metal pad just doesn't have the longevity and quality components that cobalt has."
1,I do not trust this...,"I wouldn't purchase this product. I have found the same dance pad on www.GameAsylum.com for more than $100 dollars less. And on www.GameAsylum.com thay are brand new, never opened. Why buy a used dance pad for $299 when you can get it brand new for $159?Note to seller: *Lower your price!*"
4,"Fun, farkle with a twist",This game is just like farkle but with the added twist of cards that help or hurt you. They add another element to the game that makes you want to risk your points even further.This game is also pretty good if you want to help the kids learn some simple math.
5,This game is a blast!,"Played this game with a group of about 10 and almost peed our pants! We had a blast chanting ""FILL & FLIP"" (not the name of the game but it was fun to get everyones blood going)"
5,Fun Card and Dice Game!,"I had this game a few years ago and was disappointed when I lost it in a move. So I was extremely happy to find this game again to play with my family. The game is very fun and easy to catch on. I enjoy the fact that you can set a time limit on playing it or play various versions that last longer. It's playable with 2 or more players, and portable (great game to take during camping trip). The more players, the better the game. I also found this a great tool to use when teaching addition. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys card or dice games."
5,Fun,This is a great game unless you have a girlfriend who doesn't like to take chances. Every time we play I go for a couple thousand before I stop. She goes of 500 and slowly chips away. Snore......Great game though!
5,Great fun,A great game for a couple or a whole family. We spend hours playing this at our house and always with laughs.
4,Not what it claims to be,"Fill or bust and Farkle are two separate games that may be purchased separately. The title says fill or bust dice and farkle card game. I ordered the item once and only received the fill or bust dice game. I called got a refund ordered again and was assured I would receive both items next time. I immediately ordered again and once again only received the fill or bust. When I called I was told my options were to return for a refund, which I did, however I believe this is very misleading and would like to see it removed. You do not receive both games which the word AND in the description would indicate. Not a happy camper since it is very difficult to find fill or bust and farkle in the stores."
3,flimsy cards,Cards are very thin and bend and crease easily. Have seen better quality cards for not a lot more money.
4,A great dvd remote for starters,"If you are getting tired of using the controller for dvds, this remote is a great idea. It has many features and it always responds so you don't have to get up 2 feet in front of the sensor and push buttons a hundred times to pause or somthing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the buttons are a little smaller than i wanted but neverless it is a great remote. I highly recomend it."
2,Not New product!!!!false advertising,"Ok, people I bought this remote thinking it will be new considering I purchased new and new means in original box with paper work batteries etc. I purchased this for collecting purposes not to use .but it does work and it came in 3 days . but not what I expected from the photo and saying new ....(false advertisement)...I could have bought this remote like this at my local game stop for $3.00.....:("
5,new vs. old,"simply put, this is a great product, if it doesnt work with your ps2, its because you have an ""old"" one. that doesnt make this a bad product. i own own(and a slim ps2) and it works just fine. better than all the reviews i've seen claim."
4,PS2 Remote,"This is an excellent buy for the PS2. It helps relieve the complication of using a controller for DVD use. It also gives a better feel for watching a DVD without the knowledge of it being a video game console, if that is a concern. The only dilemma is that it's only compatible with the latest PS2 models as they have a built in sensory for the remote. So just be wary of that when you make this purchase. Otherwise a great purchase especially if you need a back-up DVD player."
5,A very neat device.,"I recommend this remote control, I think is one of the best remote controls out there. The only negative thing is that I feel it is a little too wide, making a little difficult to use it with one hand, but aside from that, I think it is practically perfect. The ""scan buttons"" has 3 levels of speed, something that is not available with the game controller. It comes with its own batteries, so you don't have to buy them separately. I find amazing that a game console that, in some way is just a toy, have a so sophisticated remote control for playing DVDs."
5,Superior PS2 Remote,"I have used other PlayStation Remotes manufactured by third-parties that have done just fine; however, they always lacked some feature (e.g. being able to power on or off the PlayStation or being able to eject the disc tray). This remote is a high-quality remote that feels solid in your hand. It has all of the features that you could possibly want and controls all of the possible options available on the PlayStation. If you have a newer version PlayStation with an IR (infra-red) port on the front, then this is the remote for you."
4,Best parter for HDL,"This is a best parter for 5xxxx series, if you own a set of HDL and a wireless game controller - why? because you can reboot your ps2/change your game from your sofa - without touching your console directly.Someone may be confused. but just enjoy if you know what I said.However I purchased one not from Amazon, so don't know the compatibility that Amazon is selling"
3,Didnt recieve the remote reciever.,"Sent the remote, looks great, just now reciever... how do i use it with out a reciever?"
3,incorrect product description - note!!!,This remote is NOT as described; this is an identical remote to the $10 one available from Amazon directly and does NOT include the IR kit as pictured and described. I want my money back!
4,It works,"Using my old PS2 as a DVD player, so I needed a remote. Searched Amazon and found this one. Works as advertised."
5,Love it!,"This is the perfect burst of energy before a long run. It is not overwhelming with some flavor that chokes or consistancy that is hard to swallow. It is my new ""Fav"" before my Saturday long run!!! I strongly recommend it."
5,Instant Fuel!,"There are a number of gels and bars available for supplementing high level activities, however this PowerBar Gel provides that added punch when you need it the most. It has just the right blend of essential ingredients and the taste is better than most. If you're serious about increasing your workout level, make sure you have some of these on hand. Your body will thank you."
5,PowerBar Gel is just right!,"My boyfriend bought this flavor and I tried one. After that I was hooked. I bought the PowerBar Strawberry banana gels for my racing. I love the flavor. Some gels are too thick and some too thin, but these have just the right consistency. I am able to carry a lot of these packets in my waterbelt, because they are so small. I plan on buying these again. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that runs long distances."
5,Tastes Great!,"I love this power gel flavor! It is one of my favorite. It is tangy and makes my mouth water when I take it. I bought the 24 pack and have been using it while training for my marathon. I take it every 45 minutes during my run and I haven't hit ""the wall"" yet!"
4,worked for me,"Only a few rides 20-50 miles in so far, so tough to really evaluate the effectiveness but the taste is good and doesn't leave after taste or film that you have to rinse/wash/spit to continue on.Personal reviews as subjective as they are, on items such as this I take with a grain of salt. It's sort of like a supplement or prescribed medication, not any one item is going to meet the same need of each different person. Review multiple brands to get a pulse of what most people mention and try a couple options before settling on one!Bottom line, I like it and glad I bought a large box to run through them all before finalizing my opinion."
4,Average Energy but quick on recovery assistance,"I need an electrolyte type product for after my long distance runs, especially when it is sunny or warm out. This product relieves the symptons of dehydration as well as fatigue moments after I take it.I would recommend this product to mid level runners (about 15-25 miles a week). Very inexpensive and does it's job.I liked the fact it gave me recovery assistance and energy but disliked the taste at first. It takes a few to get use to but there are other flavors that are good. It isn't thick like GU or Clif energy shots and it mixes well with water in your camelbak, easy to swallow."
4,Got Energy?,"The taste isn't all the great, but if you're looking for something to give you a boost during your endurance workout, the combination of caffeine, carbs and other nutrients will do the job."
4,Yummm,I use these for running and they taste great...the consistnancy is perfect in them where it is not as thick as other products that I have tried.
4,"Easier to carry than to open, tangy flavor, strong caffeine","So far I have only tried this gel on bike rides. Convenient if you run out of sports drink before you run out of water. The tangy flavor made the gel easier to swallow.The packaging on this gel seems to be either thinner or more flexible than some others I have tried. Good because it is not scratchy in the back pocket of a jersey. Hard to tear the top off without losing it while riding, however. I had to stop to avoid littering.Double caffeine is perhaps too much if you take more than one gel. Again, depends on your reaction, though. (I get above average stimulation from caffeine.)"
2,Hardly tolerable,I ordered this based on others reviews that it tasted great. I force myself to use it prior to a run and can force down one during the run but the flavor is not good. Texture is fine and I think the caffeine is great however a terrible flavor.
2,"Not Yummy, Package Reacts in Mouth","I have been cycling a few hours in the heat on weekends, and using this type supplement to get what I need while riding, so I bought a case of the Tangerine with Caffeine. I have to say they seem to do the job and give me what I need, and the boost from the caffeine works as desired. The problem I have with the product is the taste is pretty bad, like concentrated children's aspirin. Also, the container/package seems to react with the my teeth or fillings, like having a battery on your tongue. So, basically consuming these is not pleasant, and I dread having to do it (like taking medicine). So, I will stick with the main competitor in this marketplace ""Gu"", which taste great."
5,Great Stuff,"I use before and during long rides. I prefer the PowerBar in part because it has 110 calories, not just 100 or 90 like some of the other brands, and at 20 mphs I want to get as much as I can when going thru the hassle of opening and consuming a gel. As to the effect: It seems to work as intended. Certainly gives me a bit of energy when I start to sag. I've also used Gu and Hammer, and don't have any complaints about them other than much fewer calories per package. Suggest you try a few of each to come to your own conclusions."
3,power bar green apple gel,The overall taste of this gel isn't too bad. Its overly thick consistency makes it a little hard to go down without a chaser.
1,Taste reminds me of black coffee,"The Tangerine doesn't taste good at all, haven't tried other flavors. I suspect they got the caffeine from coffee, not tea. Almost seemed like a black coffee taste. Some people who are sensitive to coffee might then get a stomach ache. I even tried adding sugar to it and it was still bad. Maybe the other flavors are okay since many don't have caffeine. FYI, it only has a little more caffeine then a 20 oz Coke does, try the shots if you want more."
3,fast shipping,"I received the product in a few days. My only complaint would be that the ""best buy"" date was 7/10/10 and I purchased the gel on 7/12. I wonder if that affects the product? It probably was ok, but why are you shipping expired products? Unfortunately, I didn't notice it until halfway through the box."
2,Interesting Product,"I like the idea behind this product, but in my opinion the taste is terrible. It tastes like medicine.Please note, it is recommended to take these PowerBar Gels with water."
1,Saltyyyyy!,"I received 1st order and it had 200 mg of sodium per packet, instead of the 45mg stated on product page. Amazon sent second order & it was still the packets with200 mg of sodium. Makes me gag! Oh well, what to try next?"
1,Disgusting!!!!!!!!,Absolutely gross! If you can imagine swallowing a mouth full of gel that will barely go down unless a glass of water is handy. I cannot believe Power Bar Company would put something out like this! We are stuck with a case of this garbage. DO NOT BUY!
1,cramps from hell,"it might have been the caffeine. maybe just me. but i had the worst stomach cramps of my life after taking these on a run, and it didnt stop tell i fell asleep that night."
1,disappointed with shelf life,I ordered a box of power bar energy gels and the expiration date was only 8 months from the date of purchase
2,Poor quality,The gels is great but this particular shipment of two boxes arrived in poor condition. Some of the gels paks had leaked out and I had to throw away 4-5 packs. perhaps it was old stock?
3,Can Cause Stomach Upset,"The directions state that water should be consumed with this gel, so I consumed 4-6 oz of water with each gel. On some 10 to 24 mile marathon training runs I noticed only slight gastrointestinal problems, but on others real cramps and diaria were a severe problem. The common variable during the bad runs(no pun intended)was cold, rainy weather which drasticly reduced my sweat rate. Normal gel ingestion rate is one every half hour. At 75 years old my 24 mile run lasts around 4 hours or 7 gels. That is a lot of sodium even on a hot day. Next run is 16 miles and will also be cold and probably wet. I will try one gel every 45 to 60 minutes. THe next marathon is in 2 weeks so no chance to experiment with another gel. During 7 other marathons I used another gel with no upset and may go back to that gel if problems persist. This powerbar gel is easier to swallow(not as thick and gooey)and very close to the same ingrediants as the other gel, sogave it a try."
2,Great for a long run or bike ride,"I started running a couple years ago, and I ran my first marathon last year. I always carry PowerGel with me on my long runs. Yes PowerGel is just sugar and caffine, but when I'm bonking 15 miles into a 20 mile run, I am super glad I have one in my pocket. I think the benefit comes mainly from the sugar, but I do tend to buy the flavors with 25mg of caffine. In general I give PowerGel 4 to 5 stars, but I'm giving the Tangerine flavor two stars because I didn't like the taste. All the other flavors are much better."
5,Always pleased!,We have ordered these numerous times and we're happy every time! We use these for workouts and bike rides! They do give you the extra boost you need sometimes!! Good quality item.
2,Taste was not to my liking. Kinda ewww.,Not sure how it works as far as giving you energy because I could not ingest it due to the taste of the green apple flavor.
2,busted packs,I was very disappointed when I received this shipment as many of the gel packs were busted and leaking. This defeated the purpose of buying them online in bulk to pay less per packet. I will just go back to buying them at Academy.
4,The vanilla flavor is great.,"So, I get home from work, and either have a choice of eating, waiting two hours, and going swimming or running......or eating one of these, having a half glass of water, putting my shoes on, and just go exercise.The vanilla flavor is great; it's a slightly salty vanilla cake frosting. Five stars on taste and utility.Four stars because I'm paying more than a dollar for a tablespoon of cake frosting."
3,Energy takes a bit to kick in,"My husband wanted to try this energy product. He consumed it right before a race and made the comment of not giving him the energy he was expecting for endurance. Now, the taste was really good."
5,Gels,"We have been using this all summer as a boost in the middle of long day hikes. It gives you the POP you need and believe it or not it tastes good. Not only is it re energizing it is also a treat,"
2,Skip it.,The sound quality isn't great. Nor is the overall picture quality. I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for it.
3,missing illustrations,"This is not meant as a review of the actual novel (so don't read too much into those three stars), but rather this specific edition that I ordered from Amazon. For some reason, it's missing most of the illustrations. The title page clearly states that there are illustrations by Franz Altschuler, but there are only sporadical blank pages where these illustrations should be (which seems very strange when you are reading through the book), and it is only in the last few chapters that two illustrations actually appear on such pages. It doesn't ruin the book in any sense, but it sure would've been nice to have them all, since those two that somehow survived the printing process are quite beautiful. I just thought I'd point that out, so that other readers won't be as unpleasantly surprised as I was when I started reading."
3,"Great Book, Poor Print Quality","On the Incarnation should be required reading for anyone studying the Christian faith, especially Orthodox Christianity. But, this particular version is a digital reprint of a text written in the late 1800's. Letters will vary in darkness and lightness which can be a distraction when reading for some people. Do read the book. But, you may not want this copy of it."
1,Terrible printing for such an amazing book,"I've read this book before, and it's one of my favorites so I was buying it as a gift for someone. But I was very disappointed when it came in the mail. The font makes it very difficult to read, almost unintelligible. I ended up buying a different version."
3,Excellent historical entertainment -- Tom Selleck does a fine job as Ike,"This is an excellent historical drama of the period shortly before D-Day, when General Eisenhower is faced with making earthshaking decisions upon which hundreds of thousands of lives, and Allied success, will depend. Selleck is a very credible General Eisenhower, and manages to capture the angst that Ike must have felt on the eve of the greatest invasion of all time. He also captures Eisenhower's essential humanity. This is an excellent drama.The supporting cast was not so good. There is a cardboard-caricature of General Patton to be gotten past, and numerous other supporting roles are similarly one-dimensional. Overall though, this is a fine presentation of a great general at work."
5,Well done,Wow-One forgets it is Tom Selleck and focuses on Ike and the decisions/preparation/planning for the greatest invasion of all time.
5,Ike,"If you are looking for a war movie, this is not it. It is an excellent drama dealing with the D-Day invasion planning, and should be required watching for any management candidate class. Tom Selleck's acting makes you believe that he is Ike, and together with subject matter, makes this movie a winner."
3,No Duvall,The movie came in very good condition and is a ok movie. I dont believe Tom Selleck was the right choice for this movie. although I did like the additional background of the story. It just wasnt his best work.
4,Tom Selleck's finest performance,"Tom Selleck doesn't really look like Eisenhower, but he sure looks like a general in this superbly crafted and beautifully photographed docudrama. Not a single scene of battle is shown, but the awesome planning and tensions of warfare are all there. Watch for the scene with Gerald McRaney of Major Dad who may have tried for the lead role in this one as the controversial General George Patton. This fine film, and the Jesse Stone movies starring Selleck are the finest work he's ever done."
1,Disapointed,"I purchased this book for my nephew who loves firetrucks. I read the one review that appeared for this book and purchased it. Once I recieved this book, it was a less than 20 page book for $18. I purchased the book with a vision that it contained a great variety of firetrucks in action. It showed a few, but with a book that is less than 20 pages (including all of the micellaneous pages that come with any book such as copyright page) how many can you really show. I quickly returned this book."
4,"A lovely novel, though long out of print...","I purchased this used paperback earlier this spring, on the recommendation of several friends. It was a relatively quick read. A few characterizations were rather hyperbolic, and the 'romance' for Olga Nicolaievna was not historically accurate (a grain of truth, I'll give it that). It was, however, a rare and enjoyable fictional account of how things could have actually played out. Hardcore young OTMA fans who can't get enough of the young Grand Duchesses will dig it. :o)"
2,Booted & Torn Up!,"Cats In Boots yet another hard rock/glam band that didn't have enough time to mature. The album is sleazy and dripping with testosterone wrapped up in silk scarves & spandex. Honestly they were another Hanoi Rocks influenced band that wasn't quite there yet. With time they could have been. Her Monkey was an ok song along with Shotgun Sally after that its pretty much junk glam metal. If you enjoy sleezy, thin rock with light weight production this is for you. It's not the worst album of the genre but no where near the best either."
3,SHOOT ME,The only song on this album worth a listen is Shotgun Salley... The rest of the album is a cookie cutter hair band style. So get the album burn Shotgun Salley to an mp3 then resell the album for a profit!!
4,Get Piserchia back in print!,"Some enterprising publisher ought to get Doris Piserchia's strange, anarchic little fables from the late '70s/early '80s back in print. In this one, the monster Corradado goes on a rampage in a utopian sky-city, prompting the mayor to hire another monster--an alien entity whose consciousness shuttles back and forth among three bodies--as contract killer(s). The plot follows an orphan boy fixated on killing Corradado and a crooked alcoholic biochemist who couldn't care less about the monster, as they join forces (willingly or not) with the alien hit man. Piserchia's books are subversive in that the monsters are point-of-view characters and we get a kick out of their gleeful rampant destruction of a high-tech but essentially cold-blooded urban environment."
2,"Children's books, HURD","Usually I can count on author Hurd's books to be delightful reading. ""Johnny Lion's Book"" is no exception. However, I disagree with the permissive undertone of the book within the book which may mislead children to believe that deliberate disobedience toward parents is acceptable and fun. I believe Edith Hurd can write better books than this one."
3,Drives me crazy,"We received this book as a gift for our newborn daughter. She is now 14 months. She shows no interest in the glove with the monkey faces. However, she does like the books and alternately pays attention to the holes in the pages and the raised monkey faces that show through them. When she brings this book to me to read I cringe. The pages don't make sense. For instance, the first page reads ""five monkeys jumping on the bed, one fell off...."" and the picture shows five monkeys on the bed AND one on the floor with a bump on its head. That's SIX monkeys, not including the few that are always scampering in the background. Obviously this is not a problem for my daughter but I would much prefer a book to make sense if I am going to be reading it daily. I also don't understand how a monkey ""eating on the bed"" manages to fall and hit its head. I'm not ready to get rid of the book because my daughter is so intrigued by the monkey faces but I definitely would not buy it for a friend!"
5,The glove is a hit!,We checked this book out from the library and loved it. When I saw that was sold with a glove on Amazon I had to buy it. My son giggles everytime he or I put the glove on and make the monkeys jump. Great story and fun for puppet play.
5,All Around Favorite,"I have daycare in my home and the little ones just LOVE this book! The puppet glove is a cute addition, too, although they don't seem to care whether we use it or not! They sing the song long after the book is put away and ask for it again and again."
3,Listen with your heart!,"If you can listen with your heart, this is the most beautiful music in the world. If you insist on listening with your ears, you might be disappointed."
5,Cute,My daughter-in-law has a forest animal nursery and the frame fits very well! It looks like porcelain and arrived well packaged.
2,Poorly written.,"(...) I love Shakespeare, and I thought this book would beinformative, but I was sadly mistaken. Marx uses mainly his ownopinion as ""proof"" of connections between Shakespeare andthe Bible. Of course there are ""connections""--Shakespearelived in Elizabethan England. But I wouldn't go so far as to compareKing Lear to Job or The Tempest to Revelations. Marx's comparisionsare feable and superficial at best.He remains unconvincingthroughout the book, which he pitifully tried to force into a formatlike Shakespeare's plays. Each chapter is divided into ""fiveacts."" I would have thought an intellectual would have realizedthis format was completely wrong for a non-fiction piece.There are better books out there."
2,Trouble with Samsung Customer Service,"This is a nice, well-designed moniter. Good looking, and with a very sharp picture. Since purchasing the item 6 months ago, I've had 2 horizontal lines drop out of the display. I've been working with Samsung Customer Service to get it corrected for that whole time. They're offering me everything EXCEPT a new unit (which is what I want) saying the 204B Silver unit is backordered. Hard to believe it's been backordered for 6 months. They want to give me a black unit, or a Silver unit of a downgraded model. I rate it Poor Quality and Poor Service."
3,I've had problems too unfortunately,"We have bought six of these in the last year and two of them have developed identical problems: a half dozen lines of pixels all the way across the screen have gone out--at two different heights. Samsung has replaced the one monitor and I'm about to return the other one. After reading a previous review that mentioned this problem, and having two out of six do this, I'm thinking it's more than a coincidence.Otherwise the quality of the image is really good."
5,Worked like a charm,"I chose this book at a desparate moment when my daughter was about 4 or 5. We followed the advise and it worked! You have to follow all of it and the ignoring the bad behavior is the hardest part for me, but give it a try!"
5,A Wonderful Book,Francesca's new book is wonderful. I am an ex-mormon who stumbled into her first book when research on my family led me to celtic paganism. Now I feel that my beliefs are just fine and her new book is giving me the confidence to put it all together. I hope to study with her someday. She is a blessing.
4,Very Informative,Well written and oraganized chapters. A must for those in primary care and other specialties as cardiology and nephrology. I used the book as a reference for a HTN class.
4,Fun little phone,"I live in Moscow, Russia and we cannot call 800 numbers direct so need to use a phone card or call back. I had a net2phone account from years ago that I never used as quality was so bad before broadband but happened to notice progam and tried it and it is very good so found this little phone in a store here and plugged it in. It is great. Now I can call all 800 numbers for free using freeworlddialup or Sipphone and for standard calls prefer net2phone for quality. Even now have free USA phone number with voice mail so my friends in USA can call me for free.This phone works great and interface programs opens when you lift phone. Base of phone is way too light but I filled it with plaster so not is fine. Here it sold for $20 and I got a 20 foot cord. I like it"
1,Review of Techko Entry Alarm,"This product is not good at all because it burns through batteries every few DAYS! That's right. Otherwise, it seems to sound an alarm loud enough to warn you of entry, but I cannot keep mine in batteries that often, so it is essentially useless."
4,Great songs,"I've also been wanting to get this CD for a while, this almost completes my collection. All of her songs are really awesome!"
2,Nice design but not designed well,Its a decent looking table although it sure doesn't look like it came from a high end furniture store. When I got the table I had to force it together to get the bottom shelf on. The glass didn't fit on top either. They sent me a new piece which still didn't fit so I had to spend another $50 to get one custom made. Lately the table is splitting at the seams on the top and it appears to be temperature related since the first time was when it was hot inside and I turned on the AC for awhile. The other day I had a space heater next to it and it split again. I have the smaller end table version of this too and is holding up fine though.
2,wood split within first 3 months,"I love this table. It actually looks really great and fits our decor perfectly; however, less than three months after purchasing the wood on the top is starting to split in two different areas. Wtf?!? I have no clue how this has happened and I'm really bummed about it - and too bad I'm outside the return window... ohh well, maybe I can find some filler to make it not look so bad. Anyways - the table is great but beware the cheap quality of it."
2,Damaged,"This item was damaged when I received it...as was it's replacement. I was very disappointed because the table is very nice. The appropriate packaging/shipper may make this table worth it. Otherwise, don't bother!"
3,In expensive wooden table,"I purchased this table because I liked the look of it, however the finish is disappointing.The legs were somewhat a concern after a few months, rough & starting to splinter in 1 spot. I didn't pay much & I suppose I paid for what it was worth.Additionally, the glass in the center is a thumbs down, no matter what you will never get that shine or gloss that you're looking for. I ordered the table once and it looked super dull no matter what I did to it. It had these lines that looked as if it had plastic resting on it in the heat. I sent it back to Amazon and within a day or 2 my new one arrived. To my surprise the glass wasn't much better yet I decided to keep it because it was not as bad as the last.Though I wish the glass could have looked more appealing to give that glimmer, because washing it and Windex only helped a bit but ... just a BIT!"
2,Not too terrible for the price,the only problem other than a bit of difficulty putting it together is the quality of the wood. Just a few too many defects to make it look like its a nice piece of furniture.
3,It's okay,This table is the perfect addition to our movie room. Please be aware that the looks are much better than the quality.
5,looks great,"While it has a few minor issues, once its set up it looks more expensive then what it is. Take care and time when putting it together."
1,Poor Quality!,"I carefully inspected this before putting it together. There were numerous dents in the wood and a chunk missing out of the top. The wood is poor quality, which also makes the finish look unsightly. I am returning both of their products...."
1,Worst table... ever,"I wouldn't wish this table on my worst enemy. Absolutely horrible. The top circular frame had 4 MAJOR cracks in it straight through the wood upon arrival, and the finish is so cheap it looks like this table should cost maybe $20. I returned it for a refund the same night I opened it. I love Amazon and returns are a cinch, but they should really stop letting this item be sold on their site, it's garbage."
2,Just Eh,"The table is of good quality, and it looks perfectly like it does in the photos. However the cam locks that attach the legs to the shelves are of poor quality. I had two break as I was putting the table together. I called the company and they sent a replacement package, it took a week to get to me. All the while my half assembled table is sitting in my living room. Upon receiving the replacement cam locks, two more broke (luckily they sent more than just two). Even with the replacement locks, the legs didnt fit perfectly where they were supposed to, and due to the cheap nature of the cam locks the legs did not lock tightly into position. I am going to have to figure something else out such as wood glueing the legs to the shelves so the table is sturdy.So while this table was exactly what I was looking for, and fits perfectly with my decor, its a shame the company uses cheap parts."
1,Poor quality throughout,"All of the individual parts were poorly wrapped.The quality of both the wood and the finish was horrendous.I returned mine immediately.Don't waste your time on this item. Anyone who gives it more than 1 ""star"" can't possibly know anything about furniture, wood finishes, wood quality, etc."
4,Very nice looking table,This table looks very nice. It was a little challenging to put together in that you have to balance all of the pieces together before you can start screwing things in. I never got some of the legs to be seemlessly against some of the shelves.
1,The table does not fit together,"I purchased this accent table from the seller 'Unknown' (seller has chosen ""Unknown"" as his Amazon ID) and an end table from seller 'Winsome Wood'. The end table fits perfectly and it takes my husband about 10 mins to put it together. But when my husband tried to assemble the accent table, the table parts don't fit and some parts are repainted--it seems like someone had tried to put it together but could not make the parts fit and returned it. We will return the table and will never buy from this seller ""Unknown"" again."
3,Nice table but...,"This is a nice table, however it came out of the box with many scratches on it. The packing was fine. I think the scratches were from the manufacturer. I would recommend this product from another company."
1,"Poor Quality, Wood top Cracked in Half After 3 Weeks","The table arrived just fine and assembly was pretty straightforward. Small size was just what we needed for our small condo in Palm Springs.But after we left for a few weeks and returned from a vacation, the entire wood frame top of the table literally broke in two pieces... I assume because the wood used was very ""green"" and had way too much moisture content to use for a piece of furniture. So as it dried out, the wood shrunk dramatically and split in two.So, word to the wise, unless you live in a very damp or humid climate, stay away from this product, as it is not made from acceptable quality woods... The price is very reasonable, but if you have to throw it in the trash, even a small price is too much to pay.I would return it, but as is often the case, repackaging and returning would be more of a hassle than it's worth. Very disappointed..."
3,Some assembly issues,"The pre screwed holes are too small to tighten the screws with the provided allen key. The Allen key and the screws start to strip. Be sure to have a drill with an Allen key bit, it was the only way to tighten the screws. At one point I thought I would have to return it, thinking the screws were stripped. Then I broke out my drill, fortunately had the Allen key bit in my drill kit. Applied pressure and slowly pulled the trigger, so not to continue stripping the screw, so glad they tightened. With it finished it looks good. It's not perfect, but it fit my needs for a small coffee table with a glass top and extra storage on the bottom."
2,poor overall quality,I really like the look of the coffee table but the quality is terrible. If I had bought it at a local store it would have definitely been returned. The finish was terrible. The bottom shelf had all kinds of defects. I wasn't expecting miracles for that price but I did not expect the finish to come off when I wiped it with a wet sponge. I don't recommend this at all!
3,"Nice Table, Issues with Quality","Once assembled, this is a pretty nice table. I think the picture accurately reflects the size and look of the table. Assembly was easy and only took about 15 minutes. However, the furniture itself has cosmetic issues. The first table I received had to be shipped back due to a large scratch (almost a crack) down the table top. The second one didn't have any issues nearly that bad, but there were several dings and smaller scratches on the table. If you are not willing to pay this type of money for a table with imperfections, I would highly suggest you look elsewhere. If I had the option to do it again, I would probably avoid purchasing this table unless I could confirm all of the pieces would be in good shape first."
1,Nothing in the Box,"I read the reviews, but I thought that nothing would happen and the table would get here safe and sound and I was really excited to get a new table. But when I opened the box only the top and shelf were inside. No legs, no hardware, no glass insert. The pieces that were inside were dented and scratched. In dis-belief I went back outside to see if the driver had maybe left a second box with the missing articles, but there was nothing there. I am going to exchange it (always the optimist) for a new one because I order things from Amazon all the time and every other thing I have purchased have come in perfectly. It's sad because something I thought would take a couple of days to get here will now take weeks if not months."
2,Nice story.,"I love this illustration so I bought it even though the book is used, but the book came dirty and I had to scrub it."
2,Gender roles from the orthodox perspective,"Just be aware that this book is written by the orthodox and that throughout, a mother and daughter are doing all the domestic preparations for shabbat. Suddenly at the end, a father figure is sitting at the table being waited on by the mother.If that's the message you want your kids to absorb, that's fine. I decided I wasn't going to read it again to my daughter, since there are more liberal Jewish books out there."
5,seriously?!,only two hundred sixty seven dollars for this masterpiece? what a steal. but there's only one copy left at amazon. don't all rush to order it at the same time!
1,"Died, Twice","Was really hoping this was the answer to power on long road trips for my son's feeding pump - the fuse inside of it burned twice and did questionable things to the electricity of my car (wipers going off, radio lights dying) when using this. I wouldn't risk more expensive damage to my car again."
4,A Fascinating Story,The book was an interesting well-crafted story with many surprises and interesting developments. Human emotions and interactions are handled well. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it.
4,Cinematic tale of revenge,"This was an enjoyable, quick read that reads like a novelization of a movie. It cleverly links the Dirty War in Argentina of the early 1980's with characters that come together at a present day winery/guest-villa in the Italian countryside. The suspense comes from anticipating whether and how the hero will gain his revenge for his loss suffered when he was a child. The revenge plot plays out in ways that are unexpected."
4,Great Album,"Stumbled across this album a while back and fell in love with it.It is my fav. workout music on my MP3 player, just the right mix of tempos.Wish they had done more or I could find albums of similar nature/quality."
4,Fabulous Cookbook,"This is just a great cookbook. Wonderful for someone who is just learning how to cook. I like this cookbook because it has ""real"" recipes in it that I know my family will eat. No frou-frou stuff in this cookbook. Just down-to-earth recipes, that are generally very easy to make. I would recommend this cookbook to anyone."
4,Tough Solar Casio Watch,"This watch is beautiful and works well, now that i understand the manual. Shipping was quick, despite order being placed before christmas. It was received in time for gift giving....that's more than i'd expected. It's a tough watch but not as rugged as the traditional ""g-shock"" i'm used to....overall a pleasant experience...great product so far!"
5,Excellent Cookie Sheet!,"This sheet is awesome! I like to bake cookies on a lower heat for a longer time than most recipes call for, which can tend to brown the bottoms before they're cooked through. This sheet prevents that. But the best part is it is so nonstick that I generally just wipe it down with a paper towel to clean it. Very easy to work with!"
1,Worst Cookie Sheet Ever,"I bought two of these cookie sheets after reading positive reviews about them. After using them for the first time, the lining started bubbling in the oven (cooking at 350 degrees). It went back to normal after cooling down and then when I washed the sheet with a soft sponge the lining started pealing off. I have no idea what it is made of, but I'm pretty sure that non-stick is pretty toxic stuff. I hope I didn't poison my family with these pans. Now I missed Amazon's return window and won't get refunded. Lame!!!!!!"
1,Lasted about 3 uses then I had to throw it out,This is the worst cookie sheet. I can't believe the positive ratings. I used this three times before the lining started coming off of the cookie sheet. And the silver stuff stuck to the food I was cooking and ruined the food. I can't return this because I missed the return window but maybe I'll see if they can make an exception. Now I'm back on Amazon looking for another cookie sheet...
5,Baker's Choice,Well made and priced right. The Quality and Value we have come to expect from Amazon. You wont go wrong with this item.
4,Good read!,"I love time travel novels, learning about history in this story was a plus! I'll read the rest of the series."
5,Loved it!,I really liked this series. I read all three in as many days. I couldn't put it down. Great series!
2,Bad writing,"Very poor writing and A real cliche. Don't waste your time. I like time travel stories, but this was ridiculous."
3,Interesting time traveling romance.,"I read this book in a few days and was generally pleased. I enjoy time travel stories and this one had a bit of a twist. It's part of a trilogy but after reading the descriptions for the other books it doesn't sound like this one continues on. Because of that, I'm only giving it three stars. This books ends with the possibility of continuing on with their journey but it doesn't. It just stops and picks up in the second installment with one of the other characters journey. That's fine but it left a lot of possibilities. Anyway, this is a good book, an easy book to read and good entertainment."
3,"Good, but not great!","I was excited to come across this book. I love time-travel romances, and Colonial America is a time period I'm interested in. The premise was good, but what kept me from loving the story was the lack of depth. The plot was a bit skimpy, and the characters could have used more development, especially Emilie. It takes her about five minutes to figure out that she is no longer in the present, but there is no disbelief, denial, panic, or fear. She just instantly accepts it. She doesn't seem to miss anything or anyone. There is no mention of parents, siblings, or friends. It's like she had no connections to anyone. The author keeps trying to convince the reader of this great love between her and Zane, but I honestly didn't feel it. Their interactions were awkward, and their conversations full of wise-cracks and sarcasm. It was an interesting story, but it could have been better if people and events were drawn in more detail."
5,Loved this Trilogy!!,"Amazing. Seriously. I thought at first the whole time travel thing would be a little too much, but it worked so well. Bretton always does a great job of injecting a simple romance story with some amazing background and action. It was interesting and kept my attention throughout the whole book. I can usually tell what is coming next in a book and these stories really surprised and surpassed my expectations."
3,Time travel romance with bloopers.,"Emilie and Zane go back in time to find each other.Easy to read romance novel.For all the new authors, there are some funny bloopers in this book, here are these missed edits.Goes to show that even experianced authors like Barbara Bretton can make the simplest of mistakes.unwed, though Andrew as he followed her along the stone pathway toward the front door of the lighthouse. ""t"" missing in though, should be, thought Andrew etc.(Kindle Location 1234).The minute Zane opened his mouth, McVie would something was amiss. (Kindle Locations 1268-1269).Zane grabbed an andiron from the hearth and stared menacingly at the other man. Whats an andiron?(Kindle Locations 1351-1352).(see comments, andiron is actually a word, meaning supplied by J Hopkins.And the Best:-She pulled her into his arms and kissed her soundly. Is Zane really a she?(Kindle Locations 3657-3658). Barbara Bretton. Somewhere in time. Kindle Edition.(:P.J. Fellow Author:)"
5,Love It,"I found Somewhere in Time a great book to read. Thought the ending would be different but still was great, not expected at all. Left a cozy feeling in me. Off to read the sequel. The only thing I don't like about these books is that men like Zane and Andrew are just no where to be found in real life and if you do - there is always something wrong. So reading about them is the next best thing, or so they say. There is graphic sex so beware if you offend easily."
4,Good Read,"This story had love, time-travel and historical content. The beginning was enjoyable, then the story slowed a little, largely due to the 'telling' of parts of history. However, the story picked up again and continued to be exciting and interesting. I was somewhat disappointed with the ending but as the novel is part of a series, I wouldn't hesitate to read more from this author."
5,A book everyone should read!,"Ray Pritchard answers all the ""why me?""questions beautifully in this book. I wish this book would have been available to me and my family 12 years ago when my sister Laura was killed in a car accident. Now I understand much more the glorious ways of our Lord. I am about to order 2 more books for friends of mine, who are now in their darkest time in life and are on the brink of losing faith. Of course I refuse to part with my copy!"
3,DVD quality on the 2009 game was not that good,"DVD quality on the 2009 game was not that good, I thought it was the dvd and sent it back for another but the 2nd dvd was just about the same. I'll keep them so I can watch the game agaian but you would think with the technology today the quaility would be the same as watching it on TV, but it's not."
4,Mocha Truffle chocolates.,Delicious chocolates and they come in a very nice box suitable for a good present.
2,not terrible,"Blood Oath starts off great just like the older 80's Slasher flix, but after that falls kinda short for me, yeah I agree with a couple other reviews that it's a good midnight movie and yeah the actors in fact did appear to be having a good time during filming....however my issue is that the beginning grabbed me in with two on camera kills but after that you really didn't catch any good kill action, some swings of a blade and some blood but never seeing the contact point of injury, the three girls camping tent scene would have been better to me if I could see more of the gore..don't get me wrong I mean I don't mind ""some"" off camera kills but this one just didn't deliver enough for me. All in all Blood Oath is an OK Slasher flick."
1,Irratated.,"I am very unpleased with this movie. However this is not based on the content of the movie because I have yet to see it. Unbeknownst to me the movie that I paid for is not the movie that I recieved, therefore I cannot judge how good (or bad) this movie really is."
3,"Sort of ok, sort of.","It looks shiny, but has a dull look at first glance, and it's very light. Should have checked out review, before I place the order."
1,SENT WRONG PAIR,I ORDERED THIS PAIR OF EARRINGS PLUS TWO OTHER PAIRS FROM THE SAME COMPANY. THE OTHER TWO PAIRS WERE GREAT BUT INSTEAD OF THE TEARDROP EARRINGS THERE WAS AN ERROR AND I WAS GIVEN THE WRONG ITEM. THE WRONG PAIR ARE NOT SOMETHING I LIKE AND HAVE NEVER WORN. I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND NEVER HEARD BACK. IT IS NOT WORTH MY TIME TO TRY TO SEND THIS BACK. THIS WAS EVEN MORE DISCOURAGING SINCE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER ORDERED JEWELERY ONLINE.
5,Beautiful (and inexpensive),"I ordered these in late December 2008. They were shipped quickly and arrived in great condition with a small, velvety pouch for storage. The price is difficult to beat. The silver is highly polished, so I hope it holds up. They still look great three months from purchase, and I wear them at least once a week. They've worked well for both dressy occasions and more casual wear, and have earned several compliments from coworkers and students. I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for inexpensive silver jewelry that doesn't look or feel inexpensive."
4,Great Light weight,"I received these as a gift and loved them! They do need a backing of some kind as they easily slip from the ear. They looked exactly like the picture and have held up well, even when my Toddler grabs them and takes off!"
2,Small,"Small, lightweight, not as pretty as they are in picture and just generally look a little cheaper. Maybe good for a tween?"
2,Poor quality recording.,This is a very rare compulation put together from a bunch of really scratched up 45's found in someones garage in Thailand. Some interestng cuts but not worth the price.
3,"Where are the instructions, please?","No instructions were included with this item so I tried, unsuccessfully, to locate them on the net for 20 minutes. I finally had to call Braun customer service (they were very kind and helpful, by the way). Here is what I was told:First, get a heavy towel to protect your hand while you grasp the blades (your best towel isn't recommended for this). Grasp the blades securely so they cannot move;Second, get a small flat-head screwdriver. Insert this into the bottom slot of the unit. This will stop the movement of the blade;Third, turn the blade counterclockwise to remove. Use the towel to grasp the new blade and install same in a clockwise motion.Hope this helps!"
2,Braun grinder blade,"My Braun grinder is about 13 years old, and I've ground coffee in it exclusivley. I thought the blade was way dull; it SEEMED like it was taking longer to grind the beans and not doing a good job, and being aluminum you can't sharpen it. The price of this new blade is ridicules, since you can buy a new Braun grinder for about [...] bucks more. Well the new blade wasn't any sharper than my 13 year old one and works the same as the old one, (how do I look)? The seller was quite prompt on delivery, as most Amazon venders are."
2,Did not last long.,"This hose looked great when new. The fittings are solid metal rather than the plastic I was replacing. A minor issue was the attachment of the showerhead side - the fitting leaked because the flange was not being held against the inlet. I fixed this by adding another washer. I don't know if this is the problem of the hose fitting or of the showerhead thread, though.The hose worked fine for about two months. At that point a hole developed in the outer hose casing next to the showerhead fitting and it started dripping water. Looks like the hose just rubbed thorough from rubbing on the fitting.In another couple of weeks the hose started popping out of the fitting - the swivel keeps coming apart. This happens when the water is on and the result is the hose spraying everywhere.Three months of use is really too short of a product life. I would not buy this again and would probably stay away from other Whedon products."
4,Shower Hose,"This product was a life saver. Your typical shower head hose is maybe 4-5 ft long, but when you have pets, it's no where near long enough. This was the thing that made life easier washing one of two cats and a small dog.No struggling, no manuevering your pet in the right spot to rinse or wash."
3,"It's LONG enough, but a little TOO Stiff.","I finally found a hose that would reach around behind me & the chair I sit in.""WHEDON PRODUCTS INC AF106C SUPER-FLEX SHOWER HOSE"" Link below.BUT the hose is not as pliable/bendable as I'd like. Not as pliable/bendableas the regular plastic(?) hoses but it is a heck of a lot longer.I Would buy again if only for that one feature.I've owned this hose for several months now.[...]WoW my very first review. LOL"
1,No good,This hose seems nice burg that is it. End of hose came off with in a month of use. Save your money.
5,Long!,"Boy is this long! Love it, makes dogbathing, hairwashing while in the bath, tubcleaning and so much more so very convenient! Easy install too! Win!"
5,A fantastic trip through South Africa history,"Brazil northeast has been colonized by the Dutches during the same period SA european history began. It is common to listen some authors asking what would have happened if the Dutches were not defeated by the portuguese army and remained in Brazil. Though Brazil economical situation was different from SA during the XVII century, I think prof Leonard give the answers to this question. Prof Leonard book is a very accurate,modern and independent picture of SA history. It is a must read source for better understanding the incredibly rich and conflituous history of this fabolous country."
1,Forget this card & keep shopping,"Dropped signals, made 2 different computers hiccup & stutter, and no new driver release since 2002 (just for fun, try going to uniden.com & see how long it takes you to find 'em). Never worked for more than a few minutes at a time, even with the router 5 feet away. Forget Uniden wireless products & look for something else."
5,Easily One Of My Top Ten Favorite Novels,"Suspenseful page turner, full of delicious twists and turns. One of Browne's best efforts. This novel gets my most enthusiastic recommendation."
3,It's okay,"The complete guide to Stationary Gas Engines is an okay book. I have been around the old engines for over 50 years and have seen probably a couple thousand engines go in and out of the family collection. I found the book to be of poor quality with a lot of inaccuracies. And because of the pricing guide very dated. It would be ok to have this in your old iron library but don't make it your ""go to"" book. I was somewhat disappointed. I was pleased however that one of our oldest and rarest engines was in the book."
1,Very disappointed in the product,"We had borrowed this book (1996 publication date) through our inter-library loan and were very impressed with the clarity and detail of the pictures. When we could purchase a new copy through amazon.com we were very pleased--until the book arrived. The pictures in the ""updated"" copy are not clear and details are difficult to see. The price listings in the back area are not updated at all. The back cover has only one engine shown but inside the cover it states that there are two. All in all it seems to be a poorly done copy. If we had seen this copy before purchasing it we would have left it in the store. The service from amazon.com was excellent but this book is very disappointing."
2,Watch their videos on youtube. Same stuff for free.,"These are great guys and certainly deserve credit, but I thought there would be a lot of detail in this video on their operation. It's the exact same stuff they put out on their youtube channel for free. In fact the content they have on youtube is more in depth. It's only 2 bucks to rent this video, but I certainly was expecting more."
4,Good display of Jimmy's Music,However I bought it mainly for one song. Good Timin'. I hadn't found that on any various artists CD so I decided to buy this one. Great clearity and is the original cut. So for Handy Man and Good Timin I rate this CD a excellent. The rest of the songs do have very good clearity and if you enjoyed Jimmy back then (I think he should have gotten better material and air play) you should enjoy this CD.
3,Another Beach Boy,"If you like the voice, check out ""Sail on Sailor"" and ""Funky Pretty"" on the Beach Boys' ""Holland"" album."
2,didn't help,If you want an excellent book dealing with the grid - and if you want to actually learn something - get Tim Samara's Making and Breaking the Grid. I was very unhappy with this purchase.
5,Just as I expected and more,This book is full of useful information for working with grids. I recommend this book for anyone who works with grids.
2,Not the best book for learning about grids.,"I bought this book because I thought it would help me learn how to use grid systems to improve my work. But now, a year or so after buying it I must say I can't recall it as being useful. The book does have some very cool transparent pages showing grids overlaying finished designs which attracted me to it in the first place. But the principles to do it yourself aren't explained simply/clearly enough in my opinion.I found a helpful source of info for how to build grids for the web on [...], it's the blog of New York Times Online Design Director-so he knows what he's doing. I probably have more reading/discussion with great designers to do before I'm able to use Grid in any kind of sophisticated way."
2,A disjointed read,"Grid Systems is not designed well enough for the amount of complicated diagrams it has within its pages. The tightly spaced, monotonous gray grids are unnumbered, making it extremely difficult for me to look back into the previous pages and compare what she had thought to be the leading design versus my own. It was extremely hard not taking a pen to the page myself, not only to tag the composition, but also to fix the unacceptable amount of errors. Every other page has a misplaced dot or composition, and Elam even invents compositions when she writes herself to be picking the best of the eighteen examples on the previous pages. These inconsistencies leave me skeptical of the other visuals she presents, turning my leisure reading into a scavenger hunt. In spite of this, Grid Systems did provide me with some insight into the grid and how they can be used to direct eye movement, but even then it was a bittersweet accomplishment after the time I had spent deciphering its pages."
3,I'm not sure I like this book,"The organization of the book seems a bit disjointed to me. I would have also liked to have seen a lot of the examples use actual type rather than block diagrams.The overlays are helpful, more discussion about them would make them even more useful. I want to like the book, but am not quite there. If I had to describe the book in one word it would be sterile."
1,bad griddle,I thought this was going to be a great product because it folded and was compact for storage. You can't make bacon on it because it leaks where it folds. I contacted the manufacturer and they didn't seem to care about the defect in workmanship. Do not suggest if you plan to use it to make bacon!
2,Fair to middling,"Neat concept, convenient to store.But, it's poorly made. This lasted all of 10 months (with just weekly use,) and now undercooks or burns the pancakes.Can't recommend it. Good luck."
2,Grease Everywhere,"Have had this appliance for about six months now. Love the dual controls. Love the fold-n-store feature. Hate the puddle of grease that ends up on the counter-top after use with fatty/juicy/runny foods. Despite our best detective work, we cannot find out how or where this unit is leaking/dripping grease or how it seems to miss the drip pan. I find it necessary to cover the counter-top under the unit with waxed paper before use with foods such as bacon and sausage. After a complete extensive wipedown and cleaning, I let the griddle sit for a while, folded and standing on its legs, so that the hidden grease can drip out of the unit. I then find it necessary to completely wipe down the appliance again before storage because sometimes grease continues to drip from somewhere. I am ready to chuck the appliance because I fear a grease fire some day."
1,Doesn't work!,"I just tried this product, and am very disappointed to say that it didn't work at all. Maybe all the strip-type waxes are as bad. I'm going back to hard waxes...at least they work!"
1,Who thought this mess up?,"I suddenly feel incredibly stupid for even trying this for some reason. First off, the instructions say the hair has to be at least 1/4"" long. Which doesn't seem that long... until I look at my leg hair. I don't think I have ever had a leg hair that long in my entire life. It took me two weeks to get it to 1/8"" long and it stopped. Not to mention the two weeks I had to hide my legs because I felt like a cactus constantly.Well since the hair was as long as it was going to get, I tried to wax anyway. Surprise, it didn't work. Chalking this up to the fact that the hair just wasn't going to get long enough I tried some of the wax on my upper arm(where the hair is a little longer). The wax still didn't remove a single hair. Maybe it's because my hair just isn't thick enough or something... or maybe it's because this product just bites, but I won't be using Nair products ever again."
5,excellent,"This book is set up so that it is easy to use. Plan on spending a few weeks using the practice tests, reading sample answers, and really reading the parts you don't quite remember from class."
1,boring,"I bought this book and never used it. I opened it to one chapter I was on in AP Physics, but the book was too complex and in depth. This book is more advanced than my AP Physics curriculum."
2,not the best of Mary Balogh,"This story is very predictable and not very engaging. Also the heroine is not a very sympathetic character, I felt like slapping her more than once.Try one of the more recent work of Balogh."
3,repete,Yet another collection of tails that have been published many times over in other works of his. One would think another book should at least have one story that hasn't been published elsewhere.
1,Not enough useful info,"I found very little in this book that I couldn't have found online from other sources for free. The first chapter spends too much time discussing the symptoms of MS and how people who are experiencing these symptoms should be tested for MS instead of trying to convince themselves they have something else. (Gee, thanks.) Then it discusses all the tests that will be performed to diagnose MS. Well, the reason I'm reading this book in the first place is because I have already been tested and been diagnosed. Much of the rest of the book is ancedotal stories from people with a variety of symptoms, some of which are very alarming and depressing. Overall, this book made me nervous, and less willing to learn more about MS. I was looking for helpful and practical info about MS, and didn't find it. What I did find were scary facts about the worst aspects of the disease. I needed better from this book, and didn't get it."
2,Very hard to work with and frustrating,"I am not an expert with CD/DVD writers, but even I notice that there is something wrong with this drive. It is not just the software, I think the hardware has got some design problems. My Windows2000 is very slow in recognizing that the drive is being connected and in many cases it hangs or gets into long still sessions before getting into normal operations. Nero does not recognize my drive, so I have to use the provided software with it and it is not the greatest. The drive has even difficulty recognizing raw CDs I put in its tray. In many cases it rejects them, though they are perfectly fine. In general I think you should look somewhere else for a good CD/DVD writer."
5,No Problems Burner,"I have been using this burner for about 3 weeks now and am very pleased with it. I use Windows 2000Pro,a Dell 700mhz laptop and a firewire card with the 300e. For software I mainly use DVD X Copy Platinum and sometimes CloneDVD after CSS file filtering. Haven't had one problem yet and the Memorex +R DVDs are accepted by me and my friends Panasonic S25 players. The S25 is listed as being able to only play -R DVDs but it plays my +R backups perfectly with very good quality. This Burner is not the fastest but it is very flexible and reliable. After seeing how mine works my friend is also going to get one."
1,Exceptionally poor operational standard,"I had a HP DVD200e. Dreadful. HP replaced it with a HP DVD300e. No improvement. We burned coasters on both, before getting a playable DVD. Even then that DVD would only play on the computer that transcoded it. We couldn't get it to play in 3 different laptops. It played in a Sony consumer DVD player, but the audio had a high noise content. I will never buy a DVD product from HP again. I now own an external SONY DRX510UL which is more reliable. However, I have an internal LG GSA-4040B DVD RW which is the best of the lot. If you can't fit the latter into your system, get a USB or Firewire caddy and have it as an external drive."
1,Bogus reviews,Didn't Amazon notice that ALL the 5 star reviews on this product are from the same person? It gives the product a higher total review then it deserves.
2,HP should stand for High Problem.,"I bought this DVD burner thinking it would burn CDs and DVDs. The programs it came with wouldn't burn onto a CD-R or and RW. It wouldn't even erase the DVD-RW, Or CD-RW. I know the programs it came with are junk, but even the expensive programs wouldn't burn a disc. This error message kept coming up everytime the CD is almost finished, and before it even starts. This burner only recorded two DVD discs. But it can read the DVD's and CD's. I've had problems with all the HP products I've ever used. I don't ever plan on buying another HP product again until I see they've imporved on their stuff. I returned this item to the store and now I just ordered the Sony DVD dual format burner to see what that's like. The Sony DVD+/-RW drive model DRX510UL is what I'm getting."
1,Do not buy!!!!!,Please do not buy this item.I bought one. It is broken right away (after two week; pass the store exchange time). I have called the technique service in India. I spent 2 times 3 hours with them try to figure out what was the problem. Even they figure out the machine is broken; they will not exchange my machine. They said the machine warranty is expired for 1 year warranty. The fact is that my machine is less than one year (made October 2003). I sill have the bad machine and I do not know what to with it. I have to buy another one from other manufactory.
1,I'll never purchase HP products again!,Terrible experience! Terrible support! What more can I say other than I will never purchase HP products again.
4,head wraps,"my mom ordered these for me for work. In a high dust and heat enviroment, these work great under my hardhat. I go thru 2 a day because of the heat but use them all the time. They hold up great!"
1,Topless Golf 2,"This video shows topless women golfers. It seems to me to be mainly a promotional video for the Topless Golf products. Most of the scenes seemed to be set at one place on the golf course. It did show the models hitting the golf ball. In another part, it showed the models retrieving a ball from the edge of a water hazard. The video was about thirty-five minutes long."
5,It's a matter of personal preference...,"I prefer the Bloch elastorib ribbon to nearly all other types I have tried. It is necessary to adjust the length of the ribbon so that the elastic stretches over the achilles tendon when the ribbons are properly tied, before you sew the ribbons into your shoes, but once you ascertain where that sweet spot is for you, it's an easy process.These ribbons are very comfortable, stay tied well and create a smoother line than ribbons without elastic, they also are not prone to sliding around as the elastic keeps them nicely in place. Another benefit is that they seem to hold up well, and I reuse them, removing them from my dead pointe shoes to reuse with the next pair, so in reality they are a bargain price. Also as I wear Bloch shoes, the satin color matches perfectly."
2,Elastorib Ribbon 7/8 - A0525,My daughter prefers her plain ribbon to these. The elastic is not in the right spot to be of any use for support or comfort in wear. Will not buy again.
3,It's more of a display toy,"I got this action figure, and I just want to say that its not really ideal for play. The toy isn't really that posable, but other then that, its ok. If you squeeze the legs, his arm does this little jab with his sword. I think thats cool.Again, if you want this for a cool display or toy, you may be disappointed"
5,a fresh cadence,"To encounter Ruth Daigon's poetry is to meet at once an old friend at a coffee shop and an amazing wise-woman soothsayer on a village road. These beautiful poems celebrate life--not just any life, but a life lived fully. Daigon holds nothing back here as she explores the vicissitudes of a woman's life--raising children, having a family, being part of a couple, learning from one's history--the poems sing on the page. And the simple tasks of living-- planting, fishing, picking berries, washing clothes in winter, separating an orange-- take on a new vigor and transform into small windows of possibility. This book is a celebration and a treasure--one you'll keep and enjoy for life."
1,"Is rape ""romantic""?","How Catherine Coulter could write this book based on rape, adultry and humiliation as a romance is amazing. Further, the fact that people actually found it to be a ""good read"" and gave it more than one star is sad. The hero is a cruel rapist who spends most of the book finding ways to hurt and humiliate his gentle wife. Then Ms.Coulter expects us to believe that all is forgiven and the hero is a changed man in the final two pages with minimal explanation. Come on. I don't care if this is considered typical of what took place in this historical era. It still happens today but I don't want to read about it as a romance. Its criminal and I know I will have a difficult time reading any of her other novels, many of which I have already read and enjoyed, after this travesty."
1,Terrible book,"I really love Catherine Coulter's books, but this one was too much. I thought it was disgusting that the hero was nothing more than a rapist. I realize that these types of things were commonplace in that era. However, romance novels are meant to be about fantasy. The 'Hero' was more like a nightmare. Also, it was disgusting that the main female character walks in on the hero having sex with another woman! I cannot condone such a brutal man being made into a 'Hero'. I usually keep books I buy to read again at a later date. With this book, I made myself finish it, and right away got rid of it. I'll never read this book again. I really disliked the main female character. I think this is because she put up with every thing the 'hero' did to her. By the end of the book I felt no sympathy for her, I hated her as much as I did him. I have to say that this is the worse book I have EVER read."
1,burnt out,"I know Catherine Coulter treads a not so fine line, but in this case her 'hero' is a serial rapist, who, when unduly angered by women, takes them by force. He is consistently awful to his wife and then in the last 10 pages, for no apparent reason, totally changes his tack and decides to love her.I'm never really sure why she loves him, aside from his physical strength, for there is little that is admirable or lovable about him. This is not a tortured soul looking for healing through love, this is a cruel, quite stupid man who raped a woman in a previous novel, and then rapes his wife in this one.This one goes straight into the resale pile."
3,getting a bit tired..,"I think I am going to stick to the later period romances and the FBI series. Her plot lines are getting old and repetitive, and the ""heros"" are horrible men. I don't think I can take any more. I've been a devoted Catherine Coulter fan for a number of years, and had set myself the goal of reading everything she had written. I don't think I'm going to make it - I just can't stomache any more of the violence against women in these books."
1,"Bad characters, not at all romantic","Well I was really disappointed in this book. First of all the characters were really bad. The women was such wimp and she never gets better. The man is pure jerk and even though she tries to improve his character at the very end, it is just too late. For me a romance novel is suppose to be more fantasy than reality and this book is pure horror. I absolutly hated it."
2,Get this one at the library,"If you like stories were the husband rapes his wife, sleeps with his servents and is a total jerk then this one is for you. By the middle of the book I was so disgusted with Graelam character that I just didn't care whether Graelam and Kassia got together or not. Kassia was such a little idiot, she had no backbone. If you want to read this then go to your local library, save your money, I did!"
5,I ENJOYED IT!,"I am not ashamed to say I enjoyed this book. Catherine Coulter is not your ordinary historical - romance author. Most of her novels are deep, disturbing and somewhat twisted story. You need to be an open minded person to appreciate this. You have to remind yourself that way back then, MEN are more powerful than WOMEN. and MEN thinks only about war, lands and power. No one really thought them about love. So you get the result of a hard single minded hero who doesn't know how to love but himself. as I said - need to be open minded to like this book. Well now, I am not going to read Earth Song. The third installment of the song novel. :)"
3,GOOD START TO THE QUARTET,"I enjoyed Fire Song. I read it after reading Earth Song (my favorite, although I havn't read Warrior's Song yet). I believe the author reveals the mind set of the 13th century man and woman. I felt very involved in this book, it keeps me thirsty for more. I have just finished book #3, Secret Song,and have purchased Warrior's Song. I love the thinking of that period, and I love Dienwald de Fortenberry, who makes his presense known in book 1, 2, and 3."
2,I didn't like the hero.,"I read Fire Song and was disappointed with it. Although the heroine, Kassia, was very likeable and appealing, I just couldn't take to her warrior husband. Graelim was rude, cruel, unfaithful and believed everyone else in England except his wife. If I was Kassia, I would've left him before the sixth chapter.When I was half way through the book, I flicked to the end to see what happened. This is the death knell of any book. Sorry, Ms Coulter, cruel men turn me off. Please go back to your earlier style, the Sherbrooke trilogy was your best."
2,"I'm a big Coulter fan, but...","I really hate novels where there's some nasty person who has everybody convinced she's a helpless little victim and thereby makes trouble for the heroine. I really hate novels where the hero RAPES the heroine! I REALLY hate novels where the heroine falls in love with a so-called hero who's being high-handed, brutal, and unfaithful to her. What kind of idiot does that make her? If you agree with me that Patient Griselda should have stuck a knife in her husband's wizend little heart, then you probably won't like this book either. Apologies to Catherine, but I like her later books a lot better."
3,Frustrating Page Turner,"I have read many Catherine's books and trilogies and have thouroughly enjoyed most of them. However, this book made me so angry that I wanted to hurl it across the room! The only reason I didn't is because I could not put it down. Kassia is so abused by the so called hero, Graelam, that you will weep for her, pray for his death and hope she ends up with any of the men he accuses her of being with! If that was your intention Catherine, then I applaud you for the convincing character. I will recommend this book, if only to give the reader another reason to be disgusted with some men's behavior and find sympathy in the sisterhood that puts up with them, I being one of them."
3,"Good Story, Bad Hero","This is a story that you cannot put down until you finish. The hero, Graelam, was introduced in a preceding novel by Catherine Coulter called Chandra. I read Chandra before Fire Song and read about the way Graelam ruthlessly raped a young woman who was a virgin. He did it out of some sort of power trip, and it made me thououghly disgusted with his character. After reading that, I could not see him in any sort of heroic light and it sort of ruined fire song for me. A man who commits any kind of rape, is no hero and I don't like how the author makes him out to be one in this novel. I believe it gives the message that rape is okay and it makes me sick. I do not care what century this book takes place in, rape is wrong."
1,he's a cheat!!!!,"The book might have been good if Ms. Coulter hadn't turned the main charater Graelam in an insecure adulter, I also hated the fact the his adultery was never really delt with. The book was 463 pages long and he only realized he loved his wife after 422 pages. That was just too long Ms. Coulter. The sad this was even after she lost their 1st baby he was still eyeing other women and the adultery didn't stop.I'm glad he realized he loved Kassia but I still can not imagine him ever acutually being faithful to her under any circumstance.The book was heartbreaking to say the least, and the so-called happy ending came just a little to late for my taste."
1,"The hero, ladies and gentlemen, is a rapist...","*SPOILERS AHEAD*Can somebody please, please, PLEASE provide a possible explanation as to what was going through Ms. Coulter's head when she decided to make the unrepentant rapist in ""Warrior's Song"" a freakin' HERO in her second novel of the trilogy? I booed when Chandra actually chose to save this b****** in the previous book; in my humble opinion, she should have let him die a gruesome death and leave the world a better place. I CANNOT believe this A****** actually gets a HEA of his own. And what is wrong with the heroine, Kassia? I can only guess that she has no sense of self-respect or dignity...this is not true love people, this is just fatal stupidity. It makes me so ANGRY when I want to read a romantic and admittedly intensely sensual romance novel and instead what I get is a freakin' manual for sexual assailants...what was the author thinking???Don't waste your hard-earned money on this book. It's not worth it."
3,A Mixed Bag of Animal Crackers,"This book is fairly typical of most debut collections - a couple of stories that really shine, a couple that go ""clunk"" from the beginning, and a couple that keep you reading, but by the next day you have a hard time remembering them. The title story is one of the real keepers of the year so far, and gives me hope that Ms. Tinti will produce something special in the future. The other good pieces, notably ""Bloodworks"" and the one about the rabbit (can't remember the title) have the same eerie capability to expose violence hidden (most of the time) just under the skin in a way that seems uncomfortably familiar.This effect is obvious not easy to create, and when it doesn't work, such as in ""Gallus Gallus"" or ""Preservation"", the story often seems forced and heavyhanded.All in all, it's worth exploring, if only for the title story."
5,This is a very very good book.,"These are excellent stories. They are jarring and punchy and fun. I couldn't put the book down until I finished all of them, and then I got mad because I wanted more.My wife also loved the book and she's really really picky.I'd like to say more, but I just finished my coke and I have to get up to get another one."
3,Metra dash kit honda civic 01 - 05,"product fits very well but the storage compartment is rather pathetic... its not as deep as the OEM slot and cds stick out about 1/8"" and losing the flip down door was unfortunate...but if this doesnt matter to you then overall its a good looking, well fitting product."
2,Metra 99-7899 Dash Kit For Honda Civic 01-05 - DOESN'T FIT CIVIC SI,"Shipping was on time. I paid for 1 day shipping.Quality seems fine.The part, however, does NOT fit just any Honda Civic between 2001 and 2005. My Civic SI needs a different part. Would be nice if they labeled it more clearly. I needed that part now, not on the second try. That's why I paid for 1-day shipping. Not happy."
3,it worked,"I have an 03 honda civic sedan and it worked. didn't need the black tabs that went on the sides, but whatever"
1,Not all civics included,I was shocked when I tried to connect my install kit. It did not fit when it clearly says 2005 Civic....after a call to Metra they informed me that my Civic Special Edition was not included. The description made it seem as if all civics were included but to save you the same problem get th Metra 99-7898
4,Not A Bad Kit,"Installed in my 2004 Civic LX. The kit is constructed well, feels fairly solid, and snapped into place easily. As other's have noted, the lack of a compartment door is disappointing. While it doesn't look bad, it just doesn't look as good as before. I would have gladly paid an extra $10 to get one that had a deeper pocket and closing door. All in all, I'm satisfied with this purchase."
3,Almost useless,"Bought this to install a new stereo into a 2004 Honda Civic. Upon taking out the stock stereo, I ended up wondering how this new kit was going to be installed. I tried to use only the two side brackets, but none of the holes lined up. Later I realized I had to remove the bottom tray and then the new bracket just inserts in. After the new bracket was installed, I installed the two side brackets on and pushed the whole thing in. I didn't fit well AT ALL! I couldn't put in the front face that covers the 4 sides. I wasn't flush AT ALL! In the End, I had to find some big washers and two screws from my junk pile to bolt the stereo onto the stock metal bracket. I didn't even need the two sides that came with this kit, they're useless! Don't get this kit, but something else."
5,What I need!!,"I could not find this product for the Honda on other store,and was very good to find it here, the product is excellent and we received on time."
2,Unnecessary,"After buying this, I discovered that I didn't really need it. I was able to install my new radio right into factory original radio holder thing. This dash kit doesn't have a draw like the original one does, and it has small holes in it. I recommend that you just reuse the factory holder."
3,"An okay product for the price, but didn't like the holes in the storage compartment","This definitely wasn't bad for the price. But I was kind of paranoid of the holes in the back of the CD storage compartment on this kit. I'm the kind of person that would put tiny objects like screws or bulbs in there... which might fall through one of those holes. Albeit, I don't know where they would ultimately end up after they went through. I returned this, and spent a few more dollars for a mounting kit from another company that didn't have those holes... just in case."
3,"Fits my 04 Civic well, but not perfectly","I installed this kit on my 2004 Honda Civic with a Clarion CZ501 head unit. It functions well and looks good against the black dash that came with the Civic. The only downside is that that head unit does not fit perfectly with this kit. Along both the top and bottom of the trim that came with the kit that outlines the edge of the head unit, the trim bows away from the head unit at the midpoint along the top and bottom. You have to look closely, but still it doesn't fit perfectly with what I have. Otherwise solid kit and matches the interior of the Civic dash well."
5,Great book for those just starting,"Carrol Smith's book does a great job of introducing suspension design. The book also does a good job of giving you an idea of the amount of planning and work it takes to get a race car to perform well. The book will not teach you everything you need to know, but it will get you started. I recomend this for anyone who is interested in making their car handle better or even getting into racing. It's a must for anyone doing FSAE. While reading rememeber that Carrol Smith does have a sense of humor."
3,What audience is this book written for?,"While this book does a good job of covering theoretical information in an easy-to-understand way, much of this is either fairly obvious (or described on many internet sites), and/or not all that useful.As for more practical information, the book is aimed at the driver of purpose-built race cars built in the 70's (when the book was written) who doesn't know the basics of how her car works. In contrast to the statement on the back cover, there is no indication that anything about the book has been updated. If this applies to you and you believe the suggested suppliers are still in business, buy the book.Finally the large number of typos and factual errors (e.g. the constant confusal of inertia/momentum with energy) make me question the accuracy of the rest of the information."
5,Fantastic and important for any motorsport professional,"This book in unquestionably the bible of motorsport set-up. It is an absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a professional in this industry. .... He is one cool guy and a heck of a guru!I bought Carroll's whole set of books with skepticism, but they helped me improve my game as a driver, and I am much more able to discuss with my engineer now. My engineer gave me his old ratty copy (it was obviously very heavily used) and ordered me to get a copy of my own. I AM VERY GLAD I DID.I learned more in the preface about racing than I have in years and thousands of dollars of engineering and racing schools! The reason is that all of the pertinent information is directly provided to you - right up front. It is concisely organized to help you get the most out of yourself and your racing machine."
5,Unique: technical writing that is accurate and enjoyable!,"Carroll Smith not only has a great deal of hard-won technical information to share, but his style is light and entertaining, a rarity in this segment. Smith is unashamedly opinionated, but with the breadth and depth of his experience, he has every right to be. Technical specifics share pages with amusing and insightful anecdotal information. This book should be considered required reading for anyone building a high-performance automobile."
3,very good but...,This is a very good book and I found a lot of useful information in it but I have to be honest and say that Race and rally car source book is a much better book on this subject. This book is much better organized though. I have built 3 Locosts so far and I own almost all the books on the subject and honestly found very little practical hands on info in tune to win.
2,"Too much men, too little trains","This book is very well informed but I regretted that it speaks so much about the men, their relationships, the personal stories (...) and so little about the trains and the train system itself. I wanted to learn more about how the technical and economical reasons for their choices and was a bit disappointed by that. However, the book is very well written and easy to read."
2,"Did the author read ""Merging Lines"" and ""Main Lines?""","While this book has some good moments, especially the insider's view from Conrail, it pales in comparision to Saunders' work. I was dissappointed in the coverage of the PC disaster, which repeats some old untruths (especially about labor and the New Haven inclusion). Some of the stuff on PC appears to be lifted straight from Suanders ""Merging Lines."" That said some good stories but overall too uncritical of certain figures. Also, despite occasional insights, the author fails to escape from the business writers traditional view that government is bad and was to blame for all the railroad's problems. But it was nice to see the tragically awful John Snow get his just deserts."
4,Should of been called 'Some' Men Who Loved Trains,"Not all the names in the book ""loved trains"".Too much of the book centered around on man; Jim McClellan (who apparently was a friend of the author), that I never heard of before, even after reading 'The Wreck of the Penn Central' and 'No Way to Run a Railroad' (two other must reads).It filled in many loose ends from those books since this was written fairly recently.It's too bad there was a lack of names mentioned in the last chapter where the blame can be placed regarding the current CSX situation that has been going on for the past 3+ years. Actually, it started in 1999. Conrail should of stayed Conrail."
1,Why are the trains so slow in Vermont?,This book is written in a folksy style for railroad buffs who already know the story and want to argue about it. I couldn't read it. All the details were screwy about Perlman's blue eyes and nonsense about every teeny personal detail of meetings that happened 5o years ago. I'd like to know the story but will never with these guys. Maybe they are why the trains run so slowly in Vermont.
3,the truth about every day life.,"overall, an interesting read. the title story makes the best statement about the nature of violence in modern society. it's entertainment, plain and simple. i thought some of the short stories were unnecessary and didn't convey anything. the better stories are those supported by a prevailing sense of innocence toward ""deviant"" actions and thoughts, in the sense that the characters are caught in a world where violence seems to be the only logical answer."
3,16MB Card,16MB card does its job I have had no problems with it but 64MB card works better because it holds more picture and you don't have to remove the pictures in it. The 16MB works good for pictures around the house but it is not large enough for vacations.
2,Watch is fine but don't surf in it,Water got in after a surf session. Worked in the water ok for about a year.
3,Very good but it falls off,"Good features, good price, quality seems good. However, I'm a guy of average height and weight but the pack frequently feels like it is going to slip off my shoulders. If feels like the weight inside causes the straps to slip apart, resulting in the sensation that the pack is never quite secure on your shoulders. This is annoying and would be fixed by simple chest strap."
2,Good Backpack - BUT it falls over,This is a good looking pack but it does fall over on it's front - there is no good stablizer like the last Port I got. Come on guys - the rest of the pack is really good. I need to lean the front up against a wall so my laptop doesnt fall inside the pack.
5,Let Her Rip,"I purchased the saw several months ago and have used it often. It is easy to control, adjusts easily, and is not too heavy. I find it especially useful in cutting sheet stock which can be difficult to manage on a table saw. It has plenty of power to rip 2"" oak. I'm very pleased with the tool."
5,Skilsaw review,I have only tried this saw a few times. It has plenty of power and cuts great. Easier to see the saw line on what your cutting. So far great.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SAW FROM AMAZON. .,"Great saw, but do NOT buy it from Amazon.You can buy the same saw at Lowes for the same price. Mine arrived in a huge box without packing and the factory box was crushed and the saw were damaged. The saw blade wrench was loose in the box and it looks like they sold me a returned saw that had already been opened by somebody."
2,jokes priests can tell,"far too expensive and looks to be second-hand,Ithought I could get a Bible for that price !!I am not a happy customer."
2,Of interest to Sovietologists only,"Boring, a rant on various bugaboos, written like a diary. Of interest to those who study the Cold War only."
3,Thin socks,I thought these were thicker when I ordered them. I would have sent them back but didn't want to pay shipping again.
1,Slippery Socks,"These are okay. They are too slick for me...and after the 3rd washing, they have already started to unravel and little holes starting. So...would I reccomend these....NOPE!"
2,Repetitive and Difficult print,"This was a requirement for a class and therefore I was entitled to read it. The print is small and it's very repetitive, I would hunt for some other text requirement for my students other than this particular text."
1,"condition of book ""Painting the Head in Oil""","I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO KNOW THAT THE BOOK WAS IN EXTREMELY POOR CONDITION. ALTHOUGH ALL PAGES WERE THERE, THE BOOK WAS SMEARED WITH PAINT, WRITTEN ON, AND SOME TEARS. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE COST OF A NEW ONE RATHER THAN THIS BOOK. IT IS A GREAT BOOK BUT I ALREADY HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE CONTENT THRU A FRIEND. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAID."
4,Far better than expected,"Ed McBain and his stories about the cops at the 87th precinct is classic crime novels. McBain changed the crime novel to be more down to earth than anyone else. If Raymond Chandler took the crime novel to the alley and the gutter took McBain the crime novel to be closer to the truth more than anyone else.Without McBain there would never been any The Wire or Homicide - Life on The Street just to mention a few.There would never been any Martin Beck or Kurt Wallander either to mention a few Swedish ""copy-cats"", if you get my drift.This TV-series, never showned at least in Sweden is very true to the novels. Not all of the 30 episodes is based on novels but most are. They are for their time (1961 they were broadcasted on US-television) very ""modern"" and far better than most of other series from the same era.You don't have to be a McBain-freak to enjoy them, you don't even have to be a lover on film-noir. You just need to enjoy a good crime story to enjoy this gem."
3,It's Okay,My husband read these books and really liked them. These are good but you have to understand they are old movies. We haven't finished watching all of them yet.
4,GREAT OLD SHOW,"CLASSIC COP DRAMA...WELL DISPLAYED. SOLID ACTING, SOLID STORIES, EXCEPTIONALLY WELL DRAWN CHARACTERS. THIS WAS CLASSIC EARLY T.V. AND FUN TO WATCH."
2,Lots of breadth; no depth; don't bother with this book.,"While lots of topics are included that could be on the CLP practicum, they are by no means covered in the depth that is required to pass this difficult test.The practicum is not a written test; it is a simulation.You can't cram for it; you won't pass by simply knowing general facts. You must know how to perform several tasks quickly.If this book presented the topics in a format that said 'here is what you must know', and then presented a recommended series of steps to use on the simulation, then I might be able to recommend this book.Instead, it says here are lots of things you should know about.That's not enough.If you buy this book you will generally know what you will be tested on, but you will definitely not know enough about those things to pass the practicum. You will certainly need to go out and buy several books to learn the subjects in-depth.Therefore, I cannot recommend this book."
4,I hope no one actually tries this!,"This book is full of practical and useful information. It is obvious that McAvoy has a lot of valuable experience. However, his style of writing injected a lot of his own personality into the work, which I found to be distracting. I got tired of hearing about Izavbell, and her name so unusual as to detract from what McAvoy is trying to convey. And I was a bit taken aback when McAvoy advises the reader already in chapter 1 that he or she should 'try to hit someone in the face unexpectedly with your fist' to prove a point about instincts. I hope no one actually tries this! But if you are looking for a decent book about soccer and not a great work of literature, this one is for you. McAvoy shares a lot of great drills and games to keep any team occupied for a full season!"
2,What a JOKE!,"Ill make this qwik and painless.. dont buy this phone. I researched top of the line phones for months and this one seemed to be the best. HA! I bought it and it had sooo many problems.. Not to mention the very UN-userfriendly interface, the 990's best feature, the touchscreen, turned out to be its worst feature.. it made doing anything into a complicated task of measurment and hand eye coordination to access the correct button and navigate through tha bass-ackwards menus. Ohh and did I mention that it freezes and shuts off all of the time.. save your money. I went back to my 2 year old nokia and Im loving it in comparison."
1,Do not waste your money on this,"I am a fan of sony ericsson, I love the cellphones they make I bought the P990 and I regret it, it constantly freezes, turns off on its own, I can't call because when I try is like if I have no service and I do have all signal... So I don't recomend this Item. I believe sony should make something better, the phone looks nice and it is not so big I guess that if sony could fix all the problems it has, wich I believe might be related to software problems It could be a great phone, (I tried everything, I even upgraded the software and It's still the same) In my personal opinion this phone still has a lot of work to be done on it. Sony should have waited longer and tested it a little bit more. To finish this I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PHONE, buy something else instead the W series work, I am using the W300 instead and I have no problems."
2,Disapointing,"I was a big fan of the p900 and really looked forward to getting the 990, sadly the phone is constantly locking and crashing...I have to take out the batteries to rebot.When charging from mains power supply the phone does not allow me to answer incoming calls! very frustrating for such a promising smart phone.. I going to change the sim card to element this as an issue but dont hold out much hope.."
5,No problems for me,"After the first day, I was frustrated with the phone (software problems, connectivity) until I updated the software and found further menu's and how-to's. Now it's perfect. I recommend the phone for people who likes gadgets, pda phones, smartphones, etc, but if you're not into that, this phone can get very complicated to use.I havent had problems with rebooting or program crashing so far, unlike some other customers. If you want a hi-tech phone, I recommend getting this."
1,"BUGS, BUGS, BUGS","I'm a gadget addict, had to have this phone because , on the paper, it's the best phone/pda/younameit that was ever made. Now the TRUTH: This device is full of bugs, it's ssssssslllloooww, it freezes, it's bad news. I had to return mine ( did not buy from amazon). Do your own research and see what people say.Shame on S.E. for releasing this. Like many, I was waiting for over a year for the P990. As I said , love gadgets.JT"
4,"A Good Read, Though Not The Best In The world","The Seventh Tower is an good book that is exciting and interesting. Garth Nix is a good writer, though not as good as some I've read. The book is clearly targeted towards early teenagers or pre-teens. Even-so, an adult or older teenager can still enjoy it, but it might not be the most ""deep"" book ever. Though the plot and story is good, it isn't the most detailed one. The story is fast-paced, interesting and entertaining though not quite as complex as other books. The setting is original and interesting.All in all, The Seventh Tower series is a good one, but not one you could read again and again. It's the kind of book that you can read once and enjoy alot (go to the library and get this)."
4,No Chair Covers or Hardware Included,"I bought this table and chair set to coordinate with the American Girl doll I bought for my 6 year old Granddaughter for her birthday. When I opened the box, I was disappointed to see there were no seat cushions as the product description stated there would be. The description also did not state that the set had to be assembled. That in itself would not have been so bad, except for the fact there was no hardware or instructions included. Now I have to go out and buy some screws and hope that I can figure out the correct way to assemble this toy. A big disappointment..."
2,"Doesn't work, no more birds :(","Bought this because of the good reviews, and b/c with so many products out there to choose from, I tend to trust amazon & others experiences. I have a small 5-7 gallon outside fountain in direct sun most of the day. I used just a bit more product than recommended due to others comments. It made the water cloudy in the fountain, and did not get rid of the algae on the walls/bowls of the fountain. The worst & saddest part though, is that I got this b/c it's supposed to be animal friendly. Well, birds are no longer coming & playing in the fountain- and that's the whole reason I have one- to attract wildlife. Guess I'll be draining out the water & refilling, hoping that the birds will come back. Seems like this product is hit or miss. Works for some, not for others. Maybe if I used ALOT more it would have cleared the algae, but if I have to choose birds or algae, I'll choose birds, and continue the search for another product."
4,No longer difficult to keep clear glass bird bath clean,"I purchased this product for my Mom. My sister and I bought her a beautiful birdbath last year which looks like a large glass daisy or sunflower. My Mom was dissappointed with how cloudy the water would get after just a few days. Also, there was an almost impossible to remove mineral build up that would form at the bottom of the glass bowl. She tried this product a few days after I ordered it and so far it's keeping the bath crystal clear!"
5,Fountain Clarifier got rid of our algae,Fountec fountain clarifier worked to clear the algea in our small fountain in just a day and using it weekly or so keeps the water sparkling clear.
1,Doesn't work,My mother wanted this to get rid of algae in her bird bath. Put it in still dirty and covered with algae.
2,FounTec Algaecide,"Did not do the job. I totally cleaned my fountain and then put in the algaecide. I continue to have green, slimy residue in the fountain in spite of using the algaecide every other day."
5,IT REALLY WORKS!,"I TRIED MANY PRODUCTS IN MY TWO FOUNTAINS. THEN I FOUND THIS, AND WAS NO LONGER DISAPPOINTED. IT ONLY TAKES A TINY AMOUNT, AND IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS."
1,Didnt work for me.,I have an 8 foot concrete fountain in the front yard...got this because I was looking for a bleach alternative.Did not work at all. I may as well have tossed Blue Gatorade in there.Still looking...
4,My water feature loves this,"After searching on line and at different stores, I decided to purchase the easycare fountain additive. What a difference it has made in our watrer feature. We add at least a gallon of water per day as we live in a dry climate. This product has kept the water feature clear and algae free. Thank you"
5,It Works,"No more algae in my water fountain. The only problem I have I have to add it everyday because my fountain splashes and I need to add more water everyday, so there for I have to add more product. But thats my problem. Works great!"
5,Works Great!,This product works great. I used the initial treatment on my 100 gallon fountain and only remember to put in one weekly treatment in the last three weeks. The fountain is still perfectly clean! The product goes quite a long way the maintenance dose for 100 gallons is only a couple drops a week.
2,Did not blast the algea as well as I was hoping,"We have a water feature and it did not get the algea out as we had hoped even after using a full bottle. I was so optismistic after reading other reviews, I am still in search of the best option, this was not it for us"
2,Fountain Algaecide,I purchased this product and paid for overnight shipping. Our fountain pond turned green and we had a mess. I needed something quick and found this product. I squirted lots of this and it didn't do the job. Perhaps I had a bigger problem than I thought but didn't get the results I expected.
3,Seems to be working so far...,"Well, first I will start with the condition of this bottle upond arrival. It wasn't in a box and instead was simply in a postal padded type large envelope. When I opened the envelope there was a horrible smell, wherein I realized the bottle had cracked in transit and was leaking. I immediately took it outside and poured it into our pond, because there was no other option at the time.In any case, it does seem to be working well and very quickly cleared virtually all our green algae within a few hours. It's hot out today and it's only been a couple days, so we'll see how long ths lasts."
3,NOT SAFE FOR Domestic animals,The reviews here lead you to believe this product is safe for your pets but it clearly states on the bottle that is it HAZARDOUS to Humans and Domestic animals.
1,not as advertised,"advertised as:Algaecide clears pond and fountain waterSafe for plants, birds, and wildlifeNOT safe for fishWhat I received is NOT safe for wildlife or humans -- but OK for fish.not what I needed."
5,Works VERY well-- Even for INDOOR fountains!,"I Have an INDOOR fountain, and this stuff works beautifully! It keeps the water crystal clear, and doesn't let it get stail and dirty. My dog drank from the fountain the day I put it in, and he's doing just fine! By the way, it does say on the bottle ""harmless to people and animals"", so this must be true!"
1,Fountain Algeacide,Have now given this algeacide over a week to reduce the buildup of algea in my fountains and it fails miserably. Its like not adding anything at all. I will go back to my drops of Clorox bleach
1,Waste of money,"I was very disappointed with this product. The ear piece was so big that it kept falling off my ear. Also sometimes the light is very low, not bright at all. Luckily I didn't pay that much !"
2,Be Aware of Missing Files,"Most of the files in the sample folders are missing. Otherwise, for what the money, it is not bad."
5,"well written, balanced, and long overdue for social work","This text is a wonderful antidote to the anti-religious Marxist/Feminist tracts that permeated my social work education. For those who work with real suffering people an understand of spiritual diversity, and an ability to reflect on our own biases and preconceptions, is essential for creating a truly empowering alliance with clients. All I heard about spirituality in graduate school was that all (!) religion was an oppressive, patriarchal institution that deserved contempt. This is very sad. I am grateful that this book was written, especially with its emphasis on experiential learning and self reflection. I hope it gets the wide audience it deserves in social work education programs. Nine bows of gratitude to the authors!"
5,Perfect,A Perfect Christmas gift for a 3 year old niece! Great price too! Saved me a trip to the store!

4,DVD,My granddaughter loves Barbie and the Barbie movies so this was a fun gift for her and as always the Barbie movies have a learning message for all of us as well as children.
3,A bit of a let down...,"First, I really wish they would bring back the previous voice of Barbie...it just hasn't been the same since they changed after Mermaid Tale. The songs in this movie seemed odd and out of place. The older Barbie movies with songs just made more sense & the singing was MUCH better than in this film. Every time they would start a song in this movie, my daughters (5 & 8) were frustrated because it took so long for the song to end. The story was ok - had potential to be a really special story but just fell flat. I'm not sure what direction they are trying to take the brand - but it isn't really appealing to the target market of little girls that I know. A good start would be bringing back the other Barbie voice."
2,Okay but not as good as other movies,"My daughters were excited for this movie coming out so I bought it the same day. We watched it I have to say I wasnot impressed the singing is not great the storyline is a little bleh it culd have been made a little more exciting and magical we have the latest movies charm school, fairy secret fashion fairytale mermaid etc and we love all these movies but I have to honestly say I wish I had waited to rent it instead of buy it."
4,Cute Movie,"This was a cute movie, it puts you in the Christmas spirit. For the cost its perfect brand new in package"
4,barbie a perfect christmas,i liked it was a nice movie. the movie was very good my daughter liked it very much. barbies character played a good part. Barbie a perfect christmas.
1,"Barbie video that breaks the mold, and not in a good way","SO disappointed in this video. Usually Barbie Series have positive role models and friendships and are uplifting. This video is catty, mean spirited and not the message I want my 5 year old getting. Stick with Diamond Castle, Dancing Barbies or Three Musketeers in the Barbie Series."
4,My 6 year old loved this show,"Daughter loved this show, me i thought it was cute, and I think that any barbie fan will love it."
2,Subpar even by Barbie movie standards.,"My DD(5) loves all things Barbie. I resisted the Barbie movies at first but eventually relented and let her get one (Barbie and the Diamond Castle). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the storyline and score was decent (for its intended audience) and we have purchased several Barbie movies since.This movie is NOT GOOD. There is not much of a plot and although there are some songs, they are not as charming or catchy as songs in previous movies. It seems like something that was hastily thrown together in order to be able to sell a four doll set this Christmas, and probably should have been included as a ""free gift"" with the set rather than sold as a movie on its own.My little one lost interest halfway through."
2,Doesn't meet expectations for a Barbie movie,"We have seen every Barbie movie (I have three girls ages 3-10)and own our favorites. This has got the be the worst one I have seen in terms of quality. The music and singing is awful. The younger girls are not even singing on pitch and the older girls singing voices are below average. My older girls even said that the singing is really bad and they should bring back the old Barbie speaking and singing voice. The actual plot is ok, but not great. At least it does encourage a pro-family message at Christmas. My 3 yr old has watched it twice and then told me to take it back. You dropped the ball on this one, Barbie!"
3,Horable Music,Ok the story of a perfect Christmas was good but the songs were really bad. My 5 year old daughter said something about it. Can they not get good singers for these characters? Even barbie was not even that good. this is why we think it is a 3 out of a 5. other than that it was ok. it seams like the movies are just getting worse as they go.
3,I liked it,I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 because it contained way too much rock music which I never am a fan of in childrens.films and also this film had no message for the true meaning of Christmas at all (surpse surprise).
4,Great movie,Both my girls love this movie. They are watching it as I type:) They are 5 and 3 and both keep asking to watch it. I really enjoy all the Barbie movies. I think they all have a great message and teach girls to be independent. Highly recommend
5,My daughter loved it!,"My six year old loved this movie, we have seen it about 40 times in the last two months. I can tell that the speaking voice is not the same as the singing voice of each of the characters but that does not bother my daughter at all. We both love all the songs!"
3,My Review of the Science of Sports/Rock and Roll,"Science of Sports/Rock and Roll is a very interesting movie which explains the different laws of motion. It helped me a lot to understand what was going on in this movie and it was very easy to follow.The laws of motion would be helpful to learn because you might gain knowledge in your science class. This movie taught me about Michael Jordon and why he is such an awesome player on a basketball team. Although some of the details made sense some of the features in the movie were akward and strange. For example, the guy who was speed walking did not really explain why he does it and how he is able to walk so fast and not get tired. He only said that it is a breathing technique he learned to do. Overall I thought this was movie was ok because of the previous descriptions."
2,the scientizzles of sportizzle for'rizzle yo,"This video makes me want to learn more about how sports include science. The science of sports video is good to know about because sports include every day things such as running, jumping, and other ways of moving. Using Michael Jordan as a example of sports using science because he is the perfect athlete. The other section in the video is ""Rock and Roll Physics"". It is about how easy it is to learn physics as long as you put ur mind and creativity to it. This section of the video also tells us we include physics in our everyday lives."
3,The science of sports for rock and roll.... i think,"Some parts were interesting but some parts weren't. But most of the parts were boring. My favorite part was when the class went to the amusment park, I also liked the part when Michael Jordan made in so many shots and the foul shot with his eyes shut, also when he class was in the swimming pool using the blue board and when the class went to a another swimming pool and made the wave by running forward and backward. The part I didn't like was when the narrator was talking and talking and talking, also when the class was using the hover chair. By watching this, I almost fell asleep. But I guess you can say its interesting."
2,The Science of Sports,"This movie was filled with many facts, but it didnt apeal to me. It had many interesting facts about how science plays in with sports,and how people can use science to gain an advantage in physical activities. The reason why I did not enjoy this film is because it just pointed out the facts,and it didn't present them in an interesting way. The film ""Rocket Roll Physics"" did apply the facts of physics in an intersting way, which is why I enjoyed that film more."
4,ENTERTAINING HORROR MYSTERY FROM THE 60'S! GLAD TO SEE THIS ON DVD!,"Here's an obscure film that has finally made it's way to DVD. One of the better Killer Bee movies and it's wrapped in a nice little mystery to boot! The Bee effects run hot and cold, but still deliver that creepy crawly feeling. I remember this film from Saturday's afternoon horror fest when I was a wee lad! The film holds up and is as entertaining as I remembered it to be. The DVD transfer look very good, but the titles etc seemed a little fuzzy, nothing too distracting though. It would have been nice to have some extras, even a trailer! Too bad, but it makes a fun Halloween flick!"
3,Wait for Amazon to sell it cheap!,Classic killer insect disaster film...not worth 20.00 plus dollars.This dvd will be available from Amazon much cheaper than what these sellers are selling for in the Marketplace.
3,"Some serious issues, but overall works fairly well","There is an irreparable problem with file sharing between computers on the LAN and wireless clients (YEP!), and I haven't been able to get DMZ to work (but got around it by opening ports manually).But for sharing internet, and wireless function -- no complaints."
2,"Only work for casual tasks, does not work on my VPN","For casual internet surfing users, this router may satisfy their needs without problem. However, for more serious users, this router has problems. First, do not upgrade the firmware to 1.08 that listed on Uniden web site. That particular firmware will block the communication between wired and wireless computers connected through that router. Second, I cannot make this router work with VPN of my company. I tried several other brands routers, they all work fine except for this one. If Uniden is able to fix those two problems then I will be more than happy to give it a four stars rating."
3,Interesting stories but too few recipes,"I have wanted this book for some time and finally received it for Christmas. I was disappointed to see how small it is and how few recipes are actually included. The stories of the various restaurants are interesting enough but there are not very many photographs, so it is difficult to get a sense of the place. The recipes are few and far between, with one or two included for each restaurant, but many of them just for drinks. I was really hoping for a book that had a good selection of the dishes that were signatures of these forgotten hot spots - recipes that were favorites of celebrity patrons, or that had an interesting story behind them. Unfortunately, the book doesn't have that kind of depth. It's a cursory review of establishments that are now Hollywood history."
5,I started using this book about 32 yrs ago,When I was 17 I hurt my back pretty bad in gymnastics. The only thing that would take away the pain was using this very book. I used it for about 10 yrs then got lazy and quit. I'm back at the beginning again but happy to be doing it again.
3,Take your chances,First order received had no sound out of one channel and the subwoofer. It was promply replaced by Amazon. The 2nd works fine. OK for medium sized room or smaller.
1,HORRIBLE,"I AM OVERSEAS UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH.AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE OF BABYING THE STEREO AS CARRY ON LUGGAGE IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING,AS SOON AS I REACHED DESTINATION,IT PLAYED FOR AN HOUR AND THEM STOPPED.NO SOUND.EVERYTHING WORKS BUT NO SOUND.....THIS IS MY SECOND UNIT I BOUGHT WITH AMAZON.I WILL RETURN IT AS SOON AS I GET BACK TO THE STATES.VERY UPSET"
2,I Bought It New But Got A USED One Sent To Me. Did this happen to anyone else?,"I bought another one a week earlier and that one came factory sealed, but this one was just in a bag. I've been waiting on setting all my new equipment up until I got these and now I have to wait even longer to have a replacement shipped. I'm sure the used ones work just fine, but the thing is is that isn't what I paid for. If anyone else got a used product sent to them, please let me know, I'm sure I'm not the only one."
5,"A ""bible"" book on the reality of the world","I""m glad to meet R. Lipack . His book look likea nightmare .. but it is only a true analysis ofthe real world you're living today ....Big Brother is alive now , more terrific thanyou can imagine...Thanks Mister Lipack for open our eyes."
1,That's really a crazy price,"Let's be honest. There can only be a couple dozen people interested in interwar Baltic navies who own Kindles. I am one of them. This book looks great, I have no doubt that it is well researched and adds to our knowledge of this critical period in European history. I would like to buy it- but- lets be honest here- with a Kindle price of $126 (or a ""rental"" of $34.96) the publisher clearly does not want to sell this book- they just want to annoy me. What is wrong with you Taylor and Francis? Why don't you want people to buy your books? Why would you treat your authors like this? Is this some sort of prank? Did Big Pharma put you up to this?"
3,"Answers the question, ""What does it take to be a CNE?""","Many people have chosen to become CNEs because they like computers, or because they hear there is money in it. This book looks at the CNE from the career approach, not as a study guide, but as a career preparation guide.The authors not only describe study and testing, but the work necessary to make a successful career out of the CNE, including continuing education and marketing.A worthwhile read for those planning a career change."
1,Do Not Recommend this Camera,"This is my 1st digital camera. After trying and using several at work, Cannon, Sony, Olympus, I thought I was a genius for getting similar specifications at a discount price. oooops!!At times the camera is fine, turn on, let it buzz, point, wait, shoot. Other times, forget it. No picture. No way, nothing will let the shutter snap. In broad daylight. Useless for action pics. Useless for important shots, as you never know when it will function properly. Also, it will not recognize some media cards, and it randomly stores images on the built in or the card memeory. Again, no logic. I say pay a few more $ and get a Fuji, Olympus or Sony."
1,vivitar digital camera,I was never able to use it. It was brand new when I bought. The dawn thing just turned on/off when it wanted to. I quest this was a bad experience. Good luck to who bought this same model camera.
1,Author and Publisher Should be Ashamed,"This ridiculous effort lacks any meaningful depth on Scotty Bowman and is loaded with a long stream of convoluted hockey history, some of which is factually incorrect."
1,Do NOT purchase this book,"This book was horrible. I can't believe I actually made it through the 100 pages. The author talks WAY too much about the history of the league and some of the teams and not nearly enough about Scotty. In short, it was a terrible waste of time and money."
3,Book Synopsis,"Publish Date: May 1983Book Description:Book 1 - Barlow seriesWhen beautiful Dominique Randell consented to be the hostess for the high stakes poker game she didn't know that her lush, tantalizing body was the prize -- or that the winner would be Jared Barlow, the most dashing man she had ever seen. She could feel his turquoise eyes caressing her satiny curves, setting her blood on fire. Unknowingly he took her innocence -- and she became as precious as . . . an untouched treasure.Her face was radiant, her mane of magnificent hair, and those gorgeous doe-like eyes so sultry, yet so naive. Jared imagined Dominique to be a bewitching golden goddess who knew every way in which to entice and delight a man. He couldn't wait to claim passion's sweet nectar from her lips and fill her with desire. Instead he became a slave to her silken flesh -- and his fortune was to forever crave the . . . Golden Gypsy!"
1,Bleah,"Whitely's attempt to write in a childish manner is less charming than grating, and it certainly is not authentically childlike. Anyone who thinks a grade-schooler is going to refer to people with names like ""The Man With Grey Neckties"" probably also thinks Elmo speaks just like a real toddler. Whitely's writing is a romantic presentation of a super-intelligent child of nature that is just... creepy. Nonetheless, Hoff has absolute faith not only in the authenticity of Whitely's writing as that of a child but also as a literary masterpiece-- he is wrong on both counts. Whitely was a very beautiful woman, and apparently an engaging speaker, but she was also an obvious charlatan, deluded, and mentally ill.To give any credence to a woman who claimed to be French nobility adopted out to a logging family-- well, I guess when you've gone down that road, accepting that she was a child genius who wrote a classic of naturalist writing isn't much of a leap."
5,A Must Read for All Nature Lovers,"This nature diary of a young child in Oregon brought back all my days spent wandering outdoors and learning about nature firsthand. What a rare gift. You should read this yourself and read it to your children, then take them outside!"
2,I knew Opal Whiteley personally. Biography inaccruate.,"To me, the diary of Opal Whiteley is truly a masterpiece of American primitive literature. However, I feel the Hoff biography is full of speculation and inaccuracies. Without a single footnote or source reference, he makes statements about her life and origins that are illogical and unprovable. I knew Opal personally for a decade, and knew people who knew he since the 1930's. Opal was never told about the Hoff book, as she would not have approved."
4,A Literal EYE and EAR Opener,"Do you believe nature has a voice? That when you walk a quiet stretch of beach you can almost HEAR the ocean whispering to you? Opal Whitely was an extraordinary human being, both misunderstood and respected, though unfortunately not as much until after her death. This book was required reading for a college Orality in Literature course and it set the stage for the entire semester. It is so thought-provoking, sensitive, forthright and creative that you will not be able to put it down without somehow being changed in the way you ""see"" ""feel"" and ""hear"" the world around you. There is so much to be learned. Let Opal teach you."
5,A Tender Heart,"To say this is my favorite book of all time, my most treasured, the one I would grab in a housefire - that is just a beginning. Opal brings us into the innocence and wonder of childhood in a way that inspires us to reclaim that part of ourselves. There are haunting scenes that pull you to love her and precious glimpses into her imaginings that wake you up to the magic in life. As she trots around with critters in her pockets and on her shoulders with names inspired by the great writers, christens baby chicks in the barn and finds notes and ribbons left by the fairies in the woods, Opal delights us and opens our hearts to a more tender place."
5,THE FIRST PAULINA ALBUM.,"When I first bought a cd player, This Paulina CD was one of the first 3 cds I ever bought, Its her first album and maybe her best, but she has improved her sound since 1992, The mega hits here is (MIO) and SABOR A MIEL... I love this album its pop music at her best just the way I like her.. Its a classic.... new fans need to check this one out."
3,I thought the movie was okay.,"The performences were good and the storyline was somewhat different from the original, overall I enjoyed the film just as I did the first."
5,Dissapointing,This movie isn't even a third as good as the first one. Don't waste your time watching it.
3,Could cover more material,"I'm returning this book because after two weeks of reading it I felt I could have learned more. The book starts out with the basic vocabulary, proceeds onto grammar, and concludes with practice exercises. The exercises at the end of the book are helpful for reinforcing content.Pro: Good if you would like to learn Spanish for fun at a laid back pace. The pictures and color was helpful.Con: The vocabulary vocab is limited in words. It did not contain some of the vocabulary introduced in the chapters and that was disappointing.Suggestion: buy a real textbook instead."
2,Poor book for those just beginning Spanish,"I have been using this book but because I am not fluent in Spanish and the book has so many mistakes in spelling, grammar, etc. it is not appropriate for those who don't have a basic comprehension of the new language. I find the book to be very disappointing."
2,Makes Learning Spanish Harder,"During the last three months, two friends and I committed to studying Spanish together. Maryanne was taking a class, which used this book, so Debbie and I bought the same book so we could study together.Debbie had four years of Spanish in high school. I had years of French and one year of Spanish in college. Maryanne had never studied a foreign language.After several weeks, we all agreed that this text was confusing, didn't build on what we had already covered, was a bad reference because we could not easily find information we knew was in the book, and generally made it harder to master Spanish. It did expose us to alot of vocabulary, but we felt thrown into the swimming pool instead of learning to kick and stroke.After Maryanne completed her class, we started over with this book (since we'd all paid for it), and pretty much rewrote it in a more organized fashion."
3,Hard to beat for the $$,"My title sums it up: this book isn't great, but it's hard to beat for the money--if you're looking for a book you can write in. If not, then you could spend less money; go to a used book store and get any old Spanish textbook that seems decent. (I needed a book to write in for a beginning Spanish class I teach.)If you're looking to learn Spanish without taking a class, and you're a beginner, books like this aren't the way to go. You need something with an audio-visual component . . . Come to think of it, to hek with all of this--take a class! That's what you need to do. Check out your local community college. Pretty inexpensive classes in most places. You'll learn more, and you'll have more fun."
2,Non Beginner Friendly,"I have never learned any Spanish. I am missing expressions such as How are you? Where are you from and where do you live? Which are basics for learning every language. Did not cover greetings or numbers till middle of the book.Book starts from useless vocabulary. First they start of with items in your home and than move on to ones in the school, street and body parts.Nothing is covered on CD.Than it goes to dialog in the house about how TV is more important than studying. This one at least is covered on CD so you can listen to their pronunciation.I don't think this book is good for beginners. You need to have some basics already to get most benefit out of it."
3,Average beginning text,"I'm using this book in a beginning Spanish class. Some of the exercise instructions are confusing to the point I was unable to complete them. Some exercises are missing on the CD. Even my instructor thought the choice of words in some contexts was either incorrect or not up-to-date. What's good are the conversation exercises, vocabulary sections in each lesson, and the rate of progression throughout the book."
4,Good text book,"This book is a text book that I use often, and it will last you through many classes. I love that I will not have to buy a new book for the next class. The majority of the book is in Spanish, but it isn't too difficult for a beginner to understand."
4,spanish now! level 1,"Although I ordered and received the edition my teacher dictated, the book does not contain the CDs that it was supposed to contain. It also seems to have text (dialogue) that is different from the same editions that other students in my class use.Can't explain the differences."
2,Not that good,"Spanish is a beautiful language, but this one was not written by a Spanish person, or the writer is not one, because it has a lot of mistakes in writen language. It is good for someone who needs more or less knowledge, but if you need precision all the time... this is not the best one. I am a Spanish teacher."
4,Excellent value,"This is an incredible value for the money. To purchase CD's, a workbook, and textbook could be easily over $100.00.The book is good with some errors. I am using it for a Continuing Education class. It is really perfect for that purpose. It also is good if you already know some Spanish and want to do a refresher on your own."
1,Needs to be re-edited!,"This book has tons of mistakes and misspellings which are not good for a language introduction book! Also, the answer key does not always correspond to the questions in the book; I think the book was revised to a 7th edition but the answer key was not updated. My Beginning Spanish classmates all hate this book as well. When there are so many mistakes, how can you trust the book to teach you correctly?"
3,Good Resource to learn Spanish,"The product is good enough to teach Spanish as a Second Language, Amazon is not a good place to order from. Usually make mistakes, keep your money, and is very difficult to get your money back through them!"
1,THIS CAMERA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!,"I recived this camera for Christmas and i figured out that it sucks big time. The pictures came out very blurry and needed a ton of light. I would not recomend this camera for anybody it is overpriced for what it does. I dont think you could use this at all for fast action capture. Overall this camera sucks badley i took mine back to the store. It may sound like a good deal but it isnt, because even out side in bright sunny light my pictures came out badly when holding the camera very still."
4,WOW!,wow! this is the best camera ever! It is a bit expensive and because of this i got it as a birthday-Christmas present from my parents last Christmas but still i think it it just great! and the pictures are actually in color!
1,Whatever You Do Don't waste your money on this book,"Bad like rotten sushi. Bad like bad news. bad, awful horrendous, hideous, terrible, silly, pathetic, don't by this book."
1,Outcast Idiocy,"This ripoff of a book looks and reads more like a college project than a serious look into the Japanese avant guard. While Donald Ritchie's introduction is fabulous, the rest -- espectially the writing-- is simply awful. Whoever forked out the money to make this project must have been on drugs...don't waste your money"
1,Not very good,"I was disappointed by Outcast Samurai dancer. It seemed like the author was trying too hard to be cool. Not something to be taken seriously. Photos had nothing to do with the dance itself. Writing was egotistic.I have a long-standing interest in modern dance and spent time in Japan as a teacher all of which attracted me to this book. Although the first reviewer was very harsh and the second reviewer overly excited, I have to say in fairness that this was not a book that was worth the money I paid for it. I would have been much better served by writing that actually told me more about this interesting dance style. Perhaps someone who has a great deal of experience studying this dance form could have done a better job."
1,disappointed but not horrid,"I was disappointed by Outcast Samurai Dancer. It seemed like a self-published book. Not something to be taken seriously. Nice photos. Good intentions badly written. Trying too hard to be cool.I have a long-standing interest in modern dance and spent six years in Japan as a teacher all of which attracted me to this title. Although the first reviewer was very harsh, this was not a book that was worth my hard-earned wages. I would have been much better served by writing that actually told me more about this interesting dance style. Perhaps someone who has a great deal of experience studying this dance form could have done a better job."
1,it's unexplained alright!,"This DVD is a joke. The only secret society it deals with is the masonic order and, it doesn't do a very good job of that. Anyone who has done a little research on secret societies, and the masons, would know what a joke this is.It fails to mention other secret societies, such as, illuminati, jacobin, thule society (hitler was a member), bilderberger's, etc. It shows a few lame masonic initiation ceremonies. It does not mention the incident in the 1830's when a group of mason's murdered one of their own for revealing some of their secrets and then used a masonic judge and heavily stacked masonic jury to get the perpetrator's off easy. The country was so outraged that an anti-masonic political party was created and the masonic movement all but disappeared.The unexplained is right. This DVD doesn't explain much. In fact, it's plain boring."
1,Close but not quite,There was very little plot or character development in this movie. It leaned too heavily on the nature setting to push the story along.
5,"Fast, Funny and Informative:","The Street Luge Survival Guide is a ""must read"" for everyone who has ever piloted or wanted to pilot a Street Luge or Buttboard. Darren Lott's Book is the definitive manual of the Street Luge experience and how to do it safely. It contains the necessary information needed to get safely involved in this extreme sport, including: history, equipment, safety gear, Luge design, organizations, racing techniques and much more. From beginner to expert, this book has something for everyone."
4,Excellent manual for beginning to advanced rope technicians.,"Hudson and Vine give an excellent, easy to read manual for the how-to's of rope rescue. Rangers, firefighters, SWAT officers and those folks who like to hang on rope will appreciate the logical layout and easy to follow instructions. If you have an interest in the vertical world of rope rescue, this is an excellent volume for your library."
5,Train Garden,We have a G-scale model train garden and this weathervane fits in beautifully! We have wanted one for a long time and were excited to find this one. The price is right... the size is right for our purpose. We couldn't be more pleased. Recently 100 third-graders visited the garden for an educational field trip experience. They had many positive comments.
2,Next time make it more similar of your live show .,"I saw The National open for The Walkmen in Philly and they had this really nice hard edge to them. However, after their rockin live show I was a little disappointed with the CD. Most of the songs here are slow with poor lyrics (except 90 Mile Water Wall). How many songs do I need about Pretty girls/Pretty Boys and Wives? None, maybe. The only song that compares with the live stuff is Available. If they put out an entire album like that song I would be a huge fan because they are talented. Until then, they are just Ok."
5,Wow! Contendor for best rock album of the year.,"I couldn't believe it when I discovered this album. It's so rare for an almost totally unheralded band to come up with such a powerful statement. Out of nowhere... They remind me of an American version of Pulp or the Tindersticks...or a modern rock band in the tradition of Wilco or Interpol. You will be blown away by this record, no question."
1,Not satisfied,"The product that I purchased is an oil based supplement for dogs. I have used it before and it improves my dog's skin condition. When I received my order my dog would not lick it off a plate, which is not normal. I added cheese to the supplement and my dog ate it. It gave him diarhea. The oil smelled rancid. I wrote to the seller requesting a replacement or refund and received this message ""As per our company policy we cannot accept anything back that has been opened or used"". How would I know this produce was rancid unless I opened it???? This was a rip off!!! EFA-Z Plus is a great product. This company just sent me a spoiled version of it."
1,wrong product sent,This is not the item I ordered. When I returned it is was credited $2.50 less then the purchase price. $25.00 not the $27.50 I paid plus the shipping both ways. Ordering through Amazon is not the best thing to do if you want to save money.
4,Good for what it is,"Say you're a professor or someone like that and you've just been to a conference or you're planning to go to an event like that where at least some of the people will know something about whatever critical theory is. and you remember reading some of the stuff some years ago, but you don't really use the theories much, so you're kind of rusty. and then you come across this book and start going through the pages and before you know it an hour has passed, you've finished the book and your brain is over-activated by the many theoretical memories triggered by the material. you find yourself not simply repeating what's in the book, but looking at what you already know with a kind nudge, like an overheard conversation on an airplane that reminds you of something you ought to be thinking about. ""Theory is power"" Mr. Sims helfully reminds one on page 165."
1,Not exactly a simple re-phrasing of theories,"Unfortunately, this book doesn't make it any easier to understand various critial theories. It skims over them in a way that requires the reader to already have a basic understanding of the theories, and it often explains the theories in the jargon of the theorists. In other words, it isn't very helpful for those trying to get a handle on unwieldy theories. It isn't a basic introduction, nor is it for ""dummies."""
2,Introducing Critical theory,"Too often an out of the blue comment was made without a reference to from either a previous introducing topic or a new topic that one could use as a base to understand the ""out of the blue"" new comment.Critical theory may have had its start with Socialism, but it didn't seem to have made any progress, other than critiques of Socialism. That is not what I had previously learned. It seemed to have come further in its development than just comparing the world to Socialism."
2,very small,its hard to realize from the description how small the duck is. also its boyancy is awful. it keeps either sinking or floating upside down.
1,sorry,i cancelled this order a few minutes after i made the order. and still was shipped. NOT worth my money.
2,Cooled -- but finicky and troublesome.,"1.) Looks great2.) Cools well3.) Noisy on anything less that 100% level floor (carpet is not really a good floor for this model)4.) I live in a dry climate (Southern California -- no where near water -- 30% humidity TOPS) and the water container filled up overnight... even though it is not supposed to really ever fill up according to the manual.5.) The overheat switch in the power cord shut off constantly... after 3 minutes of use the first time I plugged it in.Basically, if you have a hard wood or linoleum-like floor in a room where you dont mind some noise AND you don't mind emptying the water from it by hand -- go for it."
5,One of the ULTIMATE Spanish albums ever,"In one album, Myriam Hernandez managed to bring the best in ultimate harmonies, eternal lyrics and exceptional voice quality and sensuality that is rarely heard in today's music. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give her a 36. A must have for every one with high affinity for excellent music, especially for those who can understand the lyrics. If you can't, get someone to translate them to you accurately. All the tracks are great but the best track is Tonto...."
3,Hola Chica 2,I likey not as much and some othyers but she sings to me. Yes another US dude digging on Ms Hernandez but yes she sings well
3,Not fond of it,"Too tall (easy to tip over)& skinny. When I sip coffee, the coffee that slides back into the mug has so far to go, it splashes (onto my blouse, my glasses, my surroundings)tho' I've gotten better at sipping carefully. Also very heavy, & I like to travel light. The handle is so thick, I'll have to buy a big carabiner to strap it to my carry-on. Seems to keep liquids hot/cold; I haven't used the lid much yet, but others report positively on the no-leakiness."
2,Greatly Disappointed!,"I looked at a lot of these mugs and read a ton of reviews. I wanted a 16 oz. stainless steel mug that would keep drinks cold for several hours....one with a handle. My old 16 oz. stainless steel mug is getting banged up looking although it still works. If I leave the house at 6:30 in the morning and have left ice and water in it, and I return at 5:00, there is still ice in it and the water is still cold. This lousy Boardroom mug loses its coldness and the ice is melted in 2 hrs. The walls are very thin, so much so that you would swear it isn't stainless steel. When you thump it, it sounds like plastic does, not like metal. It is absolutely useless for keeping liquids cold so I can't imagine it keeps coffee hot. It does have a great seal at the top so I gave it two stars instead of one."
1,Bought Recently Already Leaking,I bought the mug about 2 months ago in hopes that i would have a mug that when it falls in my car will not spill when turned over. Well It has been 2 months and when it gets tossed around in the car it leaks coffee in my car. Luckily i have black seats so the stains are not bad in my car. But i am not happy with this product.
3,great mug - mildly disappointed,"This is a great looking, feeling mug, fits my needs. When I received it I was mildly disappointed because beneath the main body strap there was what is obviously a piece of something under the ""fabric"" causing a bump. I had considered returning it for a replacement but realizing the cost was below $20, I decided to live with it. The first couple of days I had no problem adjusting to the open/closed lid - in fact I rather like it. Yesterday morning while driving the lid leaked during a drink. Then it happened again. After a frustrating few miles I realized the lid needed to be really snugly screwed on. Funny, I didn't think I had torqued it so much the first couple of days. Will continue to use it being aware of the tightening issue. But - it's a beautiful mug and a keeper."
5,Trudeau Mug,"This mug is wonderful as well as attractive. Now when I turn corners in my car, my mug does not spill coffee on me. Also when I have several things in my hand and the mug tilts over, I don't worry about coffee spilling over everything. I love it!"
1,Pretty on the outside but doesn't do a good job...,"I got this mug cause the reviews were pretty descent and it looked good from the outside but when I got it I was not happy.Sure, it looks pretty from the outside but doesn't keep the liquid warm for nothing..it cools down fast..and that is not cool.I wouldn't recommend this item unless you looking for a ""ice coffee or tea"" in a hurry..."
2,Not leak-proof AT ALL,"Unfortunately my mug is not leak-proof. Not even close. In the closed position my coffee still comes out. Not at the same rate, but at half the rate - it's not a trickle. It's drinkable. I've cleaned, inspected and resealed, nothing seems to fix it. It's a good looking mug, which is the only reason it didn't get 1-star - but the main reason I wanted to purchase this mug was the spill-proof lid. I will be looking into a Contigo Autoseal."
3,Just ok for me,"Pros: Large size, Fits car holder,Cons: Received with marks/scuff marks, only keeps coffee hot with lid closed.I'm looking for something to keep my coffee ""hot"" until I'm finished. I like to sip a long while. It holds a good amount. Draw back is I have to close after every sip to keep as hot as I like it.It had a few minor scuff marks. Disappointing when buying anything."
5,GREAT MUG!,PURCHASED THIS FOR MY WIFE FOR CHRISTMAS. THE BEST TRAVEL MUG SHE HAS EVER OWNED! HAS STYLE AND FUNCTION. KEEPS HER COFFEE HOT FOR OVER 2 HOURS!! EASY TO DRINK FROM AND HOLD.
