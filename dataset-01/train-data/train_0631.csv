1,1980's video on DVD,The quality is very poor on this video.The use of Elmo's name is simply to sell it as he does not appear in the actual skits. He introduces them and thats it.I would save my money and buy an Actual Elmo video.
2,Not up to Sesame Street's usual standards,"Although I'm a fan of the wit that usually informs Sesame Street's programs (making them fun for both adults and kids), I was quite disappointed with this video. The ""jungle"" theme could be MUCH stronger, and it seems like the writers made little effort to give the letters equal time. While some letters get several scenes, others get very little time. (Admittedly, some letters receive more use in the English language, but the letters that received more time in the video were not necessarily those letters. Further, for a kid learning the alphabet, each letter is equally important.) Finally, I often found that the images that accompanied the letters didn't make the most sense and often seemed ill thought-out. My guess is that this video was thrown together quickly and without much thought, and this is a shame, as the idea of a jungle-themed search for letters has a lot of potential."
3,Not our favorite,"This is a cute DVD, but doesn't seem to hold my son's interest. Some of the images for the letters are a bit odd, and the material on the DVD itself seems pretty dated. We like the Leap Frog letter factory much better, even though we're big Sesame St. fans in our house!"
1,disappointed in video,I watched this video with my 18 month old and it was horrible. She also loves Sesame Street and there was a lack of the characters in this video. It didn't keep her attention or mine. It drove me nuts just to sit there and watch it hoping it would get better. Save your money and don't buy it!!!
5,Awsome,One of the best alphabet video's ever! Very educational and most importantly holds little one's attention! A definate must for those learning their ABC's!
1,Should last longer.,I like the others bought this for my daughter's Disney Princess themed room about a year ago and now the blinking stars no longer work and you can not open to fix. We keep it for the radio. When something else goes out we will toss it and get something else. I would not waste your money!!! We bought it for the night light feature. We now have a nightlight plugged in too.
2,Nightlight burned out; No way to replace bulbs,"This item is cute, but if the nightlight feature is a main buying point, do not purchase this item. Once the nightlight bulb burns out you cannot replace it. The unit is sealed. What a shame."
3,Princess Alarm Clock,"I bought this clock radio a little over a year ago for my daughter who was going into kindergarten at the time. It has worked fine up until now, but all of a sudden we cannot get the radio to work. We are unable to get the radio to come on at all and cannot get it off the AM frequency. That would be okay if it worked. The alarm portion and the nightlight seem to still work fine. I would expect something like this to last longer than a year, especially since the radio is seldom used and the alarm is only used during the school year. The alarm I use in my room has consistently worked for 15+ years and I seriously doubt it was as expensive as this. I would look elsewhere before considering this purchase."
2,A Disney Disappointment,"Like many others, I bought this clock last summer for my soon to be 5 yr. old's new Disney Princess themed room. It was fun while it lasted... The nightlight is done working and the sleep button is, too. The only reason I'm even keeping it is because she loves it so much. The only thing still working is the radio! What a shame!"
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this clock for my (...) daughter when we decorated her room in a princess theme. She absolutely adored it! However, it was very difficult to read the time in the daytime. A few months after we purchased the clock, the alarm stopped working. I finally threw it away after purchasing a smaller, and much easier to read, Cinderella clock alarm from Disney."
2,Hard to read,My kids love the stars that light up...but it's really hard to read the time on it because of the the blue background. I don't recommend this clock. You have to be directly in front of it at a certain angle to read it.
5,underground splice,nice little gizmo. makes splicing a treat. would be nice if there was a smaller guage version and a submersible version.
2,Disappointed,"The product did not perform as indicated. I almost burned the wire itelf trying to get it to shrink to fit the 14 gauge underground wire I was trying to splice. In the end, I used lots of high-grade caulk at eeach end an dcovered it with lots of heavy duty electrical tape, buried it and hoped for the best. I have used a similar product many years ago that perfomed much better but that was before Internet shopping and I could not recall where I purchased it."
5,Superb book from a prominent scientist,"Very thorough cover of curve and surface topics,with many original results.Brilliant bibliography.Extremely useful for serious CAD research."
4,good condition.,"Good condition, But there was a weird sticker on it over the plu# so i only got $5 when i sold it back to the school... :/"
2,Claro Que si,"This Spanish textbook was shipped quickly and was in very good condition - a good value for me. I knew it was an instructor version and that was a factor in my decision to buy it as I'm just auditing the course. However, it bore a notice in several places that it had been provided free to an instructor for evaluation purposes .... and sale, resale or further distribution .... is prohibited. It did not include the audio CD that accompanies the book."
1,terrible,"i never got this purchase, i ordered it overnight since sep 3 and today is oct 9th and i havent recieved the item yet!"
4,A Horror Flick Worth Watching!!!,"I didn't know anything about this movie before watching it and I'm really glad I didn't read about the plot or read any reviews. So, stop reading about it and just watch it! I watched it with my husband and he also thought it was a really good scary movie"
3,Could have been so much more,"This movie had one hell of a great twist...at the very end. It was clear the creators wanted to do something more than a same as everything else horror movie. However, they didn't get to that until the very end. The acting is fine. The sets are nice. Even the plot is ok. Yet the ending shows it could have been so much more. This is a nice, average, though with a very pretty setting, horror film. It has some scares and some fun scenes. I did find it fun to re-watch after finding out the twist; it was actually better the second time around."
4,"GREAT MOVIE,TOOK ME BY SURPRISE WELL DONE & SPOOKY!!!","this reminded me of old time horror flicks. The fact that much of the film wasn't in English actually added to the spook factor for me. It made the ending that much more interesting when you realize how much you've misjudged the people in this film. Liked it a lot.A surprising gem from IFC. Here comes along an independent film that I've never heard of, I take a little risk and rent it, and then...WOW. Creepy, smart, great twist at the end that really caught me by surprise.This film is a MUST for any fan of the Horror / Supernatural genre.P.SI bought it on DVD because real liked it ..just wish they release it on blu-ray & widscreen format,This movie is great! i dont understand why people are talking about how they are speaking polish and there is no subtitles... Obviously it is for a reason they dont want you to know what the ending is going to be... i highly reccommend this movie!!!"
5,I NEED MORE HORROR FILMS LIKE THIS ONE,"Im 56 years old and have been a horror fan since I was probably about 5 years old ,so I watch about every one I can get my hands on and this little gem really sticks out for me;first of all it kept me guessing for about 3/4 of the running time ,then add fresh original story ,eerie atmosphere,nice cinematograhy,above average production values,great FX and above average acting from the entire cast especially Aaron Ashmore whom ive become a huge fan of,he basically plays the same character in his many horror roles but he is very good at it and ive enjoyed all of those films as well."
4,"Good movie, a bit on the short side though.","i liked this movie,downside is; seven bucks isnt cheap for a 48 hour rental and the movie is about an hour and twenty minutes long. theres a couple of people who complained that there werent any subtitles for the polish speaking characters, i personally didnt mind it at all. theres enough going on for you to understand the sceene.To sum it up, im glad i rented the shrine and will watch it again when it comes out on dvd. watch it for yourselves and come to your own conclusion."
3,Pretty good TV movie,"This is a pretty good ""wrong man"" courtroom drama with a handful of known actors. John Corbett is the defendant, Army Sgt. Tim Hennis, who is charged with rape and murder. Rue McClanahan and Hal Holbrook play his parents. Rick Schroeder and Tom Irwin play the defense attorneys.Hennis is convicted on rather flimsy evidence and spends time in prison until an eventual re-trial, where new evidence is presented and old evidence is reviewed.It all wraps up a bit too warm and fuzzy with a bit of bad dialogue between the defense attorneys, but is generally entertaining and well made.Funny that my ""play anything"" Zenith DVD player does not recognize the disk (out of 500 I have) but it plays fine on my portable Coby and computer drive..."
4,From personal experience...,Our family got to know Gary Eastburn after his tragedy. The book and the TV movie helped us better understand what Gary must have gone through.
3,Japanese Dadaist and Zen monk is worth reading,"Shinkichi Takahashi's stormy life and spiritual journey are documented in his poetry without a single reference to ""I."" In early life, he was infected with the spirit of the european dada movement, and his poems reflect that wild spontaneity with surprising images and anti-linear leaps. Some poems also reflect a self-conscious Zen, trying to hit with a Rinzai Zen Master's directness but ringing almost a little preachy. Fascinating poetry thanks to Lucien Stryk, his first translator."
3,"Low in Calories. Weak Caramel Taste, Sorta.","I eat very little candy, but every once in a while I can't resist. Well, sometimes I'll try a candy substitute and on my last trip to the grocery store, I spotted some bags (2.75 ounces) of Werther's Original Hard Candies (Sugar Free). They're very low in calories. Okay, are they any good? Well, they taste a little like a very weak creamy caramel hard candy. I tired of them after the third one. They have a bit of an illusion of candy, but just don't match up. I doubt that I'll finish the bag. Oh well, maybe it's for the best.Gary Peterson"
2,"Candy good, reaction bad","Well, I love hard candies, but not the sugar. My husband & I saw these and thought we'd found the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldn't eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didn't realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame."
2,"Taste great, too expensive","I love these - they taste great. But I get them in the local Dollar Store. Two stars for the value, five for taste."
5,Perfect for my situation.,"I needed a new switch for my old whole house fan which wouldn't work on one of the speeds and wouldn't shut off. It's hard to believe that in the city of Boston and outlying areas that there was no hardware, electrical or big box store that carries this type of switch! Amazon has never failed me in my purchases but I do hate paying the extortionate prices the USPO charges for a simple item- I wish they'd go back charging by weight but they never will."
1,Possibly the very worst film created. Period.,"Wow. I am a big believer in aliens and government conspiracy, so when I saw this movie I figured it would be about government cover-ups. Unfortunately,it was the worst movie of all time. Uninspired, awful goodness. Trust me on this one, stear clear of this, even if you are a believer."
3,Very few pictures!,"I bought this book because of the high reviews it got, but it has few pictures. When it comes to Sign Language, I am definitely a pictures person! It is hard for me to read the description of the sign and accurately execute it. They had a couple pictures with the basics, but, for the most part, it was all written and described! I am not even tempted to pick the book up again and wade through it trying to figure out if I am doing the signs right or not. I would definitely recommend something more comprehensive with pictures!"
1,Very disappointing,"This book came highly recommended, but I was *highly* disappointed. I love sign language and Deaf culture, and have several books on the subject. This ranks poorly as both an instructional book and as a culture book. The signs are described, not illustrated, and it's very confusing to try to figure out the sign based solely on its description -- and I have been signing for 15 years! The only redeeming part of the book is its emphasis on facial expression as part of ASL. There are so many BETTER books available, don't waste your time with this!"
3,The NEO-SOUL Puffy?,"I Respect Angie Stone&Her Talent but She is becoming like the Neo-Soul Puffy with all the Covers.this time it's the O'jays Classic""Backstabbers"".She has moments with Her Vocals but after a while it's time for a Another Original Song.and the O'Jays Classic is cool as is to me."
4,not as good as the first but...,Bo Svenson is damned good in this. No he ain't the actor we were used to having in the role since he ain't Joe Don Baker but he's very good in this. He has a real integrity about him and conveys a hunger for justice.
5,BO SVENSON MAKES GOOD PUSSER!,I KNOW THE ORIGINAL WAS THE BEST BUT I THINK SVENSON MADE A BETTER PUSSER. I THINK HE WOULD'VE BEEN AWESOME IN THE ORIGINAL.BUT PART II IS ALMOST AS GOOD. NOT AS MUCH ACTION BUT STILL WELL WRITTEN AND ACTED. THE FIRST ONE WAS SO GOOD WHAT DID ANYBODYEXPECT. PART II'S ARE RARELY AS GOOD CAUSE PEOPLE EXPECT TOO MUCH. IF YOU LIKE THE FIRST YOU'LL LIKE PART II!
3,This movie was a little better.,"This DVD was a bit better than the other Bo Stevenson Walking Tall, The entire series. It still didn't compare to the original one that I saw on T.V. years ago."
5,My third grade teacher read it too!,"My third grade teacher, Mrs. Walsh read ""Nancy and Plum"" to my class and my two brothers classes before me. The book has stayed with me since the early 70's. It will always evoke happy memories of my teacher and those wonderful minutes spent while she read to us.I have searched for it everywhere. I am so glad to see it back in print. Did all third grade teachers read this gem or just those in Ohio?"
1,daylight rubbery,i got this download thinking it was an anti virus application i really donot know what i got for my $10 i mean what on earth is this thing that was forced on me without being able to return it because it is digital download
2,Disappointed with this book,"I purchased this book from our local bookstore. I browsed through the pages and liked what I seen. I then brought this book home and excitingly began reading and attempting to follow the ""Try It Out"" exercises. In reality, I spent too much time struggling with the typos, inconsistencies and missing steps.After about two weeks, I gave up using this book. I just recently discovered Amazon and more importantly, discovered the customer review section. I'll pay special attention to this section and choose my next book when both a ""Look inside this book"" feature is provided, and after I decipher which reviews are real versus those from those sponsoring the book (two highly rated reviews from the same location on the same day)."
2,Not the same quality as other WROX publications,"I purchased 3 WROX books in the past this with good success. I expected the same thoroughness, but unfortunately, couldn't find it in this one.As a somewhat seasoned developer using both Visual Studio and GoLive on our Corporate Intranet, I only needed to acquire familiarity with the features within Dreamweaver for my own personal use.I enjoyed the overview and first few chapters in this book, and soon began to appreciate the potential this book might have. At the end of chapter two, I compared my project with the illustration in the book. They didn't look the same. I was determined to find out why, so I compared my code with the downloaded code. They were different. I rechecked the steps in the book looking for the missed steps, but didn't see it.If you want to learn Dreamweaver MX, and don't mind checking your code with the downloaded code, then this book might work for you. For me, I'll look elsewhere."
4,Marvelous history with real stories,Best said by author: It makes us appreciate what we have when we consider what others went through to get us where we are today.
4,Interesting stories about heroic pioneer women,"I skipped much of the preachy writing of the author, but the stories of actual women pioneers which he retold were fascinating."
2,Sooo strange!,"I'm obviously not a very bright person as most of this book was a struggle to understand what on earth she was on about. I've read the glowing praises of the majority of the reviewers and can only conclude that it's far too clever for my simple understanding. To read and enjoy a book, I must have some liking for some of the characters, but the way M/s Hazzard rushes on like a freight train, bombarding the reader with unfinished sentences and words which would require even a moderately well educated person to have to dive for the dictionary, is just too much for me. I've decided that life is too short for me to waste any of my limited remaining years battling with this smarty pants, clever book, and to enjoy the many books that I've yet to read."
2,Mislead by Other Reviews,"Based on these recommendations, I selected ""Transit of Venus"" for my book club. Result: Everyone hated it. The writing style is affected to the point of being unintelligable. All readers agreed that the story was borderline absurd and the plot scattered and poorly constructed. At best, I consider this book a case study of highly stylized writing and poor editing. I learned my lesson to never subject my fellow book clubbers to a book based solely on recommendations!"
1,The Transit of the Tedious,"How lucky, there are books for every taste. But some books are so overdone and pretentious, one must assume some of the more glowing reviews are sponsored by the friends of the writer or the publisher. Surely, without the motivation of a book club, most of us would put down this pinkie-in-the-air soap opera after the first chapter. It is not time well spent unless you are in jail and have read everything else six times."
2,"Jane Austin, Not","Jane Austin without character. First the characters are very shallow and uninspired. Second the characters have no character. They are not torn between right and wronge, well at least not in the first 147 pages, I would have stopped long before this were it not for my book club meeting. The most entertaining part of the work so far is I find myself casting the movie. Hmm, I think Jude Law as Paul, Catherine Zeta Jones perhaps for Caro, obviously Nicole Kidman or her pal what's her name for Grace. Perhaps Henry Thomas for Ted, and throw in Anthony Hopkings and Emma ? that should be enough star power. Anyway I'm back to work on this, must finnish by the 13th"
4,Good and not so good,"I read this book about 20 years ago, but when I picked it up again, I didn't remember a thing about it except that back then I didn't like it. I liked it this time, but found the writing pretentious. Why should I read entire paragraphs without understanding them when I have read, understood and enjoyed other ""difficult"" books from Tolstoy to Bellow to Atwood? Maybe the problem is that this is British from an unfamiliar era. Oh, well. I didn't really like any of the characters. Caro was cold, Grace a whimp, Christian self-involved, Ted a martyr, Paul egocentric. The protraits of minor characters such as Caro's fellow office workers were the best part of the book. The plot was nothing much and the end...well, did they live happily ever after or not? I couldn't figure it out.But it did keep my attention and entertain me for a week. Not all that bad."
2,The Emperor's New Clothes,"Shirley Hazzard obviously has great literary gifts, but I nevertheless regard this novel as a failure. The characters are lifeless, one-dimensional and stereotyped, the plot slow-moving, and the language overly ornate. The most vibrant characterization is of Dora, the professional martyr, who raises her two younger sisters, (the protagonists), after they are orphaned. Hazzard captures the essence of a woman whose joy in life is complaint, and whose ultimate weapon is the suicide threat, but no other character is more than a paper doll, clothed in fancy phrases and incongrous metaphor. Most of all, this novel is about Shirley Hazzard. It screams ""Look at me! I can write! I am wise! You will have to work if you want to decipher my meaning."" But was it worth the time?"
2,the people all nasty or weak,"Shirley Hazzard's novel, The Transit of Venus is beautifully written: the language was wonderful, very descriptive. There were some excellent scenes. The characters, however, leave a lot to be desired. They all seemed to be either nasty or weak, or sometimes both. There wasn't anyone there to really love or believe in. For lovers of language, this would be a satisfactory experience, but if you value the story as much as the language, you might be disappointed. I got to the last paragraph and was completely confused, having dismissed an earlier vital clue as an extraneous detail. I had to go online to read some discussion groups before I had figured it out. I'm not sure the reading experience, the quality of the writing, was worth the effort for the final outcome. I found it heavy going. I'll hesitate before devoting time to another Shirley Hazzard book."
3,A nice book but not what I had expected,"Now i've been reading Outlanders since the first book and so far they had all been great with each one better then the last. But this last one was a dissapiontment in my eyes. Although I will admit that it had some good qualities,it just wasn't near as good as the others.And um,since you came out with Outlanders that doesn't mean you'll be getting rid of DeathLands anytime soon,does it?"
1,HEY Glibbers,"your band sucks balls....... k who would come up with the title ""glib"" for a band?? Well actually, we would - our band (we live in Colorado) is now called ""-Glib"" because you are stupid and stole our damn name.alright, shut up and quit - your singer is terrible"
2,The Very Best of Kris Kristofferson?? I dont think so,Very disappointed in the quality and sound of this cd. I love Kris Kristofferson and this was not the best cd to showcase his talent.
4,"While not Duncan't best, it hit me the hardest.","While I have to concur with the other reviewers in their criticisms of aspects of The Jaguar Knights, it nevertheless had more of an emotional impact on me than any of the rest of the series. Perhaps that's due in part to the markedly darker tone, but I think the impact derived mainly from a strong identification with one of the characters (Dolores). She was, for me, the most three-dimensionally crafted, with her mercurial personality shifts not seeming like inconsistancy, but as genuine complexity.The conclusion of the book, somewhat unexpected, was where the real impact lay. Ripped my guts out..."
3,The Jaguar Knights....aaaahh...Ok.,The book was fine. Nothing special and not as good as previous titles.
1,Not at all like the other King's Blades' books,"I was a very big fan of all of the other King's Blades books. I started with Paragon Lost, but then went back and read all of the others. I would highly recommend any of the other books. I eagerly awaited the release of Jaguar Knights . . . and was sadly disappointed. It is so much worse than the others, it was almost as if Dave Duncan didn't write this one. I bought Jaguar Knights in hardcover, but if he writes another installment in the series, I will definitely not bother with the hardcover. However, I will still give his next installment another shot due to the strength of the prior books."
5,Very smooth shave,"After 6 or 7 years, my original Power razor finally died because the seal around the power button finally gave and water got into the electronics. I thought that was a great run considering the first one was a gift and I thought the whole power thing was a gimmick. When the motor died and I shaved without it, I noticed the difference. I could live without it, but choose not to.I shave in the shower without any shaving cream with these razors and I get about 6 months out of each blade. I think I can get away with this because I have fine whiskers and only need to shave every other day. The ""manual"" blades fit this fine. I do not notice a difference between them and the power blades, so I always buy the cheaper ones. I did a little search on line and apparently a lot of people found out the same thing."
3,good price,Got it very cheap when the deal was going on. Liked it. Doesn't felt a lot better than my Mach3.
4,awesome price,"I bought this for my husband since this is the only razor that he'll use. Their price is usually over $10 and this was a real bargain. I felt like buying two but then i saw the cartridges also on sale. With such great prices, i just had to have it. Shipping was faster than expected and it arrived nicely packaged on time."
4,Great shave if you can afford the cost of the blades,I put aside my buying an electric razor. The Gillette has given me the best shaves ever and the fewest nicks. It is a very popular razor in my gym where I have had two taken from my gym bag. The razor is cheap but the blades are expensive. This is a trick learned by the computer-printer industry where they sell to you the printer practically at cost but then you keep paying through the cost of the inks. Gillette pioneeered this technique many years ago.l
2,SHAVED ONE BY GILLETTE,"JUST BOUGHT A GILLETTE FUSION PROGLIDE. IT IS PACKAGED IN PLASTIC CASE THAT YOU CAN NOT SEE CONTENTS. THE PACKAGE SAYS 1 RAZOR 2 CARTRIDGES. GILLETTE ISCOUNTING THE CARTRIDGE ON THE HANDLE AS ONE OF YOUR TWO. THEY CONSIDER THE HANDLE TO BE A RAZOR. GILLETTE IS SHAVING ONE CARTRIDGE FROM YOUR PURCHASE.WITH THE BLADES BEING PRICED HIGH, GILLETTE IS BEING CHEAP, AND DAMAGING THEIRGOOD WILL. JUST BE AWARE THAT APPEARANCE IS DECEIVING. THE HANDLE IS ARAZOR BY GILLETTE'S DEFINITION, THEY HAVE PLACED ONE OF YOUR TWO CARTRIDGES ONTHE HANDLE TO MAKE IT A RAZOR. YOU HAVE ONE LESS CARTRIDGE THEN YOU THINK.LARRY"
4,good thing just got better,"Already multi-blade shaver excels in shaving experience.this one add agitation to it so it makes the shaving evensmoother and safer.In openGL, to get rid of digitization artifacts of edge,you can do by ""shaking"" the scene. This one might get theidea from that, albeit in a mechanical way."
4,This book has a wide range of useful information.,"You get a taste of the history of the bus along with some pretty good photos of the various models. The book also gets into buying and restoring a bus. With information on customizing. I would recommend the book to someone who is interested in buying a bus, especially if they intend to restore or customize it."
2,Boring Coffee,"I was just loaned this CD by a coworker and boy it is terrible. I was trying to compare it to something I've heard before, but to no avail. It isn't as good as anything that may be played on the radio! Hopefully, you'll spend you're money on something more worthwhile - like Barry Manilow's early work or the Robot Wars soundtrack."
5,Great read,"It reminded me of a time when books were well written. It actually used word that had more than one syllable. I find many ""best sellers"" now are written for morons. You dont have to think and you ALWAYS know hat is going to happen. This book has some surprises. I really enjoyed it."
1,Poor imitation of better authors,"Comparing this book with Eco or Borges does it a disservice since it leads to disappointment; it does not even attempt to do more than amuse the reader. In that respect, it aims to be as enjoyable as a good Perez-Reverte or Alexandre Dumas. Plot driven, with flat characters, it had the potential to entertain, but sloppy writing (or poor translation?) and repetitiveness turned it into one of the most boring books I have ever read. I love the genre to which it belongs - it is just a very poor exemplar."
3,Moby Dick it ain't,"Based on some of the reviews you'd think this was one of the greatest novels in history. It is interesting, funny in places, and well written for the most part. However the use of coincidences on coincidences and the 'hero's' constantly rushing out into the rain, or snow, or dark, with no real plan in mind gets to be tiresome. In the end I found the psychotic police inspector and the delusional ex-spy the most sympathetic characters in the book.I enjoyed some of it, really disliked some of it. So I guess I'd say that it is inconsistent and difficult at times.One thing is that Barcelona is not, in my opinion, nearly as interesting as this book and others make it sound. I tried to spend a month there a couple of years ago and got bored in 10 days. That might be just me, but I have friends who live in Spain who also feel Barcelona is over rated."
1,"Over-hyped--Appeared Strong, But Fizzled","I was thrilled when I first bought this book--it sounded as though it had everything. However, as I proceeded through it, I was bored by far, far too many details, not nearly enough suspense or interest, and a plot that used virtually every literary cliche imaginable. I finished it only because it galls me not to finish a book and at least give it a fair try. Overall, it could have been a much better book if the unnecessary details were eliminated and the plot were stronger and less superficial."
4,I enjoyed reading,I enjoyed reading this. I did figure out who the mysterious figure actually was before it was explained in the book but still enjoyed reading. There were lots of thought provoking statements made by one character in particular.
5,great book,This book has lots of twists and turns. It has an interesting style. I really enjoyed reading it. great charactors.
3,Somewhat silly,"I'm clearly in the minority here, so I only post this to save a reader of my same sensibility the cost of this book. It's not terrible, but I expected something a bit more sophisticated. All the ""suspenseful"" scenes read like a rehashing of every mystery scene you're ever read. Shadows hovering in alleys, etc. I had trouble finishing it."
2,Did not hold my interest - AT ALL,"I did not give up on this, I read it all the way through and kept waiting for the book to get to a point, or grab my attention. Nothing happened - after I finished the last page, my thought was ""so what"" - I questioned why I bothered to finish it. It's a NO."
1,An unbearable and vicious book by a madman,"Sincethe majority of the ""reviewers"" on this page say this book is the best novel they have ever read, that only confirms my belief that americans are naive, superficila and provincial. Ruiz Zafon, the author, has found a formula to delight american readers by providing them with unlikely stories, tortuous plots, cheap suspense and soap gothic drama.I think The shadow..... is an insult to human intelligence and an abuse of our time, time that we could be investing somewhere else, like in Eric Ambler perhaps?"
2,"More symbolic than entertaining; good book for reflection and contemplation, but not to be read for enjoyment","Note: I listened to the book via download from Audible.com.The Shadow of the Wind is the type of book on which I have difficulty reviewing. It seems like a novel in which symbolism and parallels are plentiful, but the story of which I found eminently boring and tedious. I had a similar problem with The Road by Cormac McCarthy. What was probably a meaningful book was drowned in a boring story. If you are looking for an entertaining and light-hearted read, then this is not a book for you. If you are looking for a book to contemplate and reflect on, then you may be in luck. I fall definitively into the former category, leading me to give the book 2 stars."
2,massive Oedipus complex,The book is quite well written. However the author seems to struggle with a massive Oedipus complex of his own. He includes six father characters in the book. Four of them are evil and the remaining two just non-understanding and mostly useless. Not a single 'good father' to see anywhere...
4,Definitely a page turner,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite not knowing whether I would like it at all. It's not the sort of book that I would normally choose, but it was a book club selection so I got to read it nonetheless. As it turned out I read it in two and a half days and got very frustrated when I had to put it down to get other things done. The mystery of it keeps you intrigued throughout the book.Some fellow members of my book club felt the style was a bit flowery, but I enjoyed that myself.My only critique is that it was a bit too well wrapped up in the end; while on the one hand I liked having all the loose ends tied up, it also made it a bit too tidy."
5,Great book,"I read this book on a reccomendation. It has exceeded my expectations. It is gripping and atmospheric, and transports you into the life of the main character, Daniel. Everyone else has already said what is important here. I just wanted to add that the book was not at all confusing, despite the plot being quite complex. I actually thought that it manages to weave a multi-faceted and intriguing story without losing the reader!"
4,Good read,"This book started off really interesting, then I lost interest towards the middle, then the last 1/3 it picked up again. I enjoyed the gothic mood of it. It has just the right amount of dark."
4,Lovely. Warm. Fun.,"I just loved this book. It is really a warm-hearted, touching story about a young boy, coming of age; his father; and a delusional vagrant that they hire to help out in their bookstore. The adventure begins when the boy reads a book written by a comic book villain. He and his vagrant friend are off to find this mysterious author. On the way they stumble into life's ups and downs.If you enjoy true literature (excellent translation and prose), boyhood stories, and mystery, you'll love shadow of the wind."
2,What Borges?,"This is a nice little melodrammatic novel, that has absolutely nothing to do with Borges, Eco, Marquez and other luminaries it is being compared to. While reading it, memories of a Brazilian soap opera I used to watch when still a kid kept bothering me. Maybe this would be a nice start for Zafon's next novel: somebody haunted by a forgotten soap opera. I bought this book partly because the jacket mentioned Eco (not Stephen King), and partly because I love Barcelona. Well, it turned out that King is Eco, when compared to Zafon, because the novel completely lacks the metaphysical dimension. It has all the necessary romance ingredients: trouble in the family, angry parents, suffering teenagers, secret pregnancies, incest, love letters, sick lovers, monomaniac fathers -- you name it. It also is the most kitsch novel I have come upon lately. Not recommended."
1,I tried to like this book!,"I tried to like this book, I really did, but after reading a little more than half, I FINALLY gave myself permission to end my suffering! Like many of the other one-star reviewers, I had assumed ""Shadow"" had to be a great book based on rave reviews. I have no idea what there was to like about this book; it was boring, overly wordy, excruciatingly long, and the characters were not interesting or likeable. I'm glad I gave it up!"
4,Very interesting,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. The characters are written about in great depth; they were all so colorful. This was a book read for a book club, I probably would never have picked it out for myself, but I am so glad that I read it."
4,beautiful,love the book ...very well written...interesting ..my only take is that with all the mystery in the book...it is solved toward the end by a letter...should have worked more on that...
2,Disappointing,"I really can't see the charm that this book holds for so many. It started fine but could not hold my interest. I didn't think the writing was exceptional though many reviewers here felt the opposite. I thought his attempt to constantly be setting a ""spooky"" mood failed for me and his descriptions in this effort were often trite. I also felt the translation in some of the writing. I found it hard to really love the characters and the main character was inconsistent in how he was portrayed. Just a disappointment."
4,Beautiful,"A compelling story that takes over you, and forces you to live it with all the passion and respect it deserves. Made me cry three times. It is not the masterpiece everyone raves about, rather it is a beautiful story we can all relate to, especially people who have a profound love over books. Made my month, brilliant! P.S. If you are a NATIVE SPANISH SPEAKER or you can handle Spanish as a second language without any trouble, BY ALL MEANS, READ IT IN SPANISH!!!!!!!!"
4,Smooth Transaction,"The used book received was in very good condition and arrived rather quickly. Thank you for offering it on Amazon. The story ""The Shadow of the Wind"" is extremely entertaining, a real page turner, which is a good thing considering its length!"
5,Wonderfully different writing style. Good story.,"The Shadow of the Wind is an excellent book. Very well written and it really draws the reader in to a Spanish way of thinking. Without realizing it, the reader gets a much better view of Spanish Culture. I read it on my Kindle and liked it so much I had to order a paper copy. I got a used copy that was in excellent condition. I plan to use it as a walking guide to Barcelona next year. It even has a suggested route in the back which was not obvious on the Kindle."
3,The Shadow of the Wind,"Interesting when you can finally get into it. I kept wondering where this was going because it is unusual but,it does unfold in sort of a convoluted way."
5,AWESOME,"Not only is it an incredible mystery that won't let you put it down, but the historical details of Spain keeping you on your feet at every twist and turn of the storyline. Can't recommend this book enough for historical fiction fans and mystery lovers."
2,An air of fantasy,"This book has had a lot of hype so I thought I would read it. It tells an improbable story of a boy who by chance comes into possession of a copy of a book by Julian Carax. The boy, Daniel, seeks to find out more about the author and the book tells about that search, and of the romance which led Carax to leave Barcelona to go to Paris. There is much extravaganct melodrama, none of which really caught me up. Yes, I wanted to know what would happen, but there was nothing too admirable about any of the heroic characters--though one had to be ""for"" them rather than the excessively evil people seeking their destruacition. I was glad the ending was as it was, but the air of fantasy hanging over the events--none very logical--did not remind me of great novels of the classic genre--which I think the book was designed to do. I found it too long and was glad it was not longer. I understand there is a prequel, but I am not tempted to want to read it."
5,Wonderful book,"I won't write a plot summary as many other reviewers have already done so; I will only say that this is one of the best books I've read in awhile and is definitely now on my list of favorites.It's not a light read - the plot is intricate and detailed, and there are many characters and details to follow, but it is absolutely worth it. The writing, a little long in some areas, hits the mark in so many others - it's poignant, touching and so interesting!"
3,A Good Read--But Forgettable,"It takes awhile to get into this novel. It is very wordy. You do (after about 300 pages) reach the point where you want to see what happens. I had a good idea of the denouement, but had to finish the book to prove my deduction correct. After a week will I remember the characters' names? No. Did I feel for the characters? Not particularly. Did it make me smile, laugh or cry? No. Would I recommend it? Yes to someone who likes entertaining, romantic gothics, but not to someone who enjoys books who's characters you care about."
2,I just don't get it...,"I see so many rave reviews for this book and I just don't get it...I didn't like the book. I recently struggled through 130 pages and quit. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. I found the drama contrived: for example, I would know that a scene was supposed to be suspensful (or sad, etc.) but it didn't feel suspensful (or sad, etc.). The writing didn't transmit any feeling. My match.com dating profile is a more compelling read.I found the characters flat; there wasn't a single character that I cared about. The book just didn't seem to have any soul/meaning/purpose, if that makes any sense. I prefer books with characters and storylines that have depth and meaning, and this book was definitely lacking.Maybe I'm a harsh critic. I'm currently reading Midnight's Children by Rushdie, and it is incredible. To compare, that's an example of 5 out of 5 stars (in my book)."
2,"Nope, couldn't finish it.","I usually finish books, and I usually don't review them here, but I've got to take this one down a few notches. Whatever the ""secret"" was I'll never know because the story was so uninteresting. The main character bumbled around the town of Barcelona finding one dead end after another over and over again. I tried to keep on thinking there would be a payoff, but at a certain point the weak plot got too boring. If you like well crafted stories with no dead ends and characters who have at least some level of wit, say, by the likes of Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett, or James Clavell, DO NOT bother with this one."
3,A well thought out story...but not the 'masterpiece' the reviews said,"What an unusual book.I can't say it was unputdownable because it was. I found reading this novel slow going, yet also enjoyed the story each time I picked it up.I got confused with some of the characters, maybe because they had Spanish names and it took a while to get used to.Suddenly when I got to about page three hundred the book held my interest more and I was glad I read on to the end because the story within the story was a really good one...I just wished it could have maybe been simplified by a hundred pages."
5,Twists and turns through a myriad of subplots!,"Life in post World War II Spain, fractured family relationships, loves lost and found, mysteries and murder, coming of age, and the treasures of books are all themes wonderfully woven together in this novel. Don't pass up the opportunity to read this book...and be sure to leave a couple of hours of uninterrupted time to finish the last half as you won't want to put it down! My only wish was that my Spanish was good enough to read the original as some of the translation was a bit anachronistic...some of the sayings were clearly more modern than the times in which the story takes place. Certainly not a big detractor though. Felt a little odd to be reading a story centered around a love of books on my Kindle too!"
5,"by far one of the best, if not THE best book I ever read","The plot is dense, the characters are very well developed, and the book is gripping from the very first page, such that you wont put it down until you have read the last sentence on the very last page. you cant get enough of the story, you keep on reading until your eyes are dry and hurt, but you wont put the book down. this is one of the books that I will likely read a second and maybe a third time. honestly, I think this is the best book I have ever read, certainly one of the best five books. the sad thing is, once you finish it, you are certain that the next book you will read will not be as good, and the one after neither. It is a jewel. I would give it ten stars, if there were. go buy it, take two days of, surround you with you favorite food and dive into that wonderful story which is set in post franco aera barcelona. certainly a book lover's story!"
5,Wonderful Book!!,"It was a great pageturner for me. Wonderful descriptions, witty characters, great plot, and very satisfying ending (unlike The Angel's Game). A bit dark at times, very funny moments too.I recommend it to anyone who loves intrigues.I don't understand how this book got any bad reviews."
2,Better than his second novel...,"...but not by far. TSOEW might have fared well at novella length. Foreshadowing Zafon's second novel, this one, too, is completely bloated -- hundreds of pages longer than it should have been. If endless doors ""ajar"", sunrises poured like molten copper/gold/tin/iron across blood-red/coal-black skies, putrid/stinking/rancid flesh, and shadows -- my God, the shadows! -- are your thing, and if you love a pat ending, occasional moralizing and a pretense to intellectualism, then you're in for a treat. The second star in my rating is by comparison with Zafon's truly unbearable followup novel, and because the story at the core of TSOEW -- buried under Zafon's gloppily layered prose -- is at least a clever one.What Borgesian book adventure will Zafon think up next? For my part, I doubt I'll make it past the title."
4,Gets under your skin,"Carlos Ruiz Zafon's Barcelona-set SHADOW OF THE WIND has been repeatedly compared--quite inaccurately--to Borges, but it is really more akin to Sebastien Japrisot's A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT and Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT: it's basically a multi-threaded story of doomed love, set against historical upheaval and pieced together years after the fact. It has fine Gothic atmospherics that really make it compelling. There are, however, quite a number of narrative lapses throughout that may betray the author's comparative youth. (For example, Ruiz Zafon frequently has his main character read documents by other characters that are all told in the same basic style and that have information within them to which the characters writing the narrative could not possibly be privy.) It was an enjoyable read all told, however--whatever its errors, I could not wait to get back to it while reading it."
2,give me a break,"Aside from the obvious Marquez rip-offs and the heavy-handed purple prose (lots and lots of shadows, mists and blown-out candles), this novel also suffers from extraordinarily shallow characterizations. Is it a parody of a (bad) gothic novel? But there's no real irony going on that I detected. For all the plot intricacies, I still struggled to finish it. Why oh why is every female such a flimsy (though, of course, exquisite) shell? And why is the villain so very very thoroughly demonically evil so as to be silly? Finally: I thought this was supposed to be about ""the power of books"" -- but it was more about a young man's obsession with the mysterious author of a rare book, which is a very important distinction. Very little in this novel made me think about literature, aside from the cutesy flourishes the author brought in to prove he is well-read (a cat named Kurtz, for example, and a boorish boyfriend named Buendia)."
2,What did I miss,"After reading a few of the other reviews I'm tempted to doubt my impressions of this book. This novel takes 300 pages to get going and while I did ultimately finish the book and found some to enjoy, I found it difficult to connect with most of the characters. How many 10 year olds do you know that ultimately devote their life to pursuing a single book? Sure, this was another time before the days of TV and the like but I found the basic plot to be absurd. I spent much of the book not sharing the passion for the plot that our main character possessed. While much of the mystery was intriguing, I found myself getting bored by the hunt to unravel and only started aggressively turning pages when the mystery started to unfold 300 pages in.It had its moments but fell short for me."
5,One of the Best in a Long Time,"I didn't know anything about this novel when I picked it up and haven't always been real impressed with the hot best sellers. Wow, was I in for a surprise. This is hands-down one of the best books I've read in awhile. It has it all from beautiful imagery, murder, intrigue and of course tragic love that makes a wonderful gothic story. If I had to say anything negative, it would as others have stated, tying the loose ends up in a letter rather than playing them out in the story. This is one of those books that when you are through reading, you actually miss the charactors and want to spend more time with them. My husband read it after me and he also became addicted to the story and didn't want it to end. Great book - can't wait to read more from Mr. Zafon."
5,Can't put it down!!!,Once you start is tooo hard to stop!! You'll love every single chapter!!!Must read it! A friend told me about it and I do not regret my decision!!You will thank me!
5,It's got it all,"I checked out this book bacause it was on the Goodreads top books list and because a review said it had a bit of Umberto Eco in it. It was intelligent, spooky, suspenseful, humourous, and poignant. I couldn't put it down and will probably read it a few more times."
5,Great book,"This book was recommended by a friend and was different than the books I had been reading in the months prior to it. I love the setting, characters, and the mystery!"
4,Reviewof Shadow of the Wind,"One of the best books I've read this year. I love the story line, the setting in Old Barcelona and the characters, Daniel and Fermin so much."
5,Shadow of the wind,"It's the first book I read by Zafon. His book is riveting, spell-binding and addictive.His use of words portrayed such vividness and clarity.The book held my interest to the very end . I just could not wait to read his other book. This is a definite read for any language or literary enthusiast. What Zafon does is use words so efficiently that the images become real immediately leaving you spellbound by both the imagination as well as his expertise as a modern writer. To miss reading Zafon is to miss the cherry on top of the whipped cream. Worth every word. Highly recommended."
4,"Slow beginning, but it gets better","This is the kind of book that needs to be read as quickly as possible so that you don't forget what happened in the beginning by the time you get to the end. The cast of characters is enormous and the author describes each of their lives in far more detail than is strictly necessary. The complex lives of all these characters makes for a very complex plot, which at times can become quite confusing. The author takes a long time to weave his complicated tale, so the book starts off slowly. But stick with it. It starts to pull you in about a quarter of the way through. Ultimately, the book is about Daniel's (the narrator) quest to learn more about the obscure and seemingly forgotten author Julian Carax. This quest eventually introduces many subplots both in the present and the past. Eventually, all the threads of these little stories come together in the end and it all makes sense. Despite the slow beginning, by the end it's hard to stop reading."
3,review,"This book is well written, and it has a very good plot. I normally don't read these types of books, but overall it is a good book for a book of this genere. I only gave it three stars because I thought it was a bit long, and a tad bit slow at times."
4,One word: Intoxicating,"This is truly a fantastic book.The description on the jacket can give you the basic details. Love story, biblio-phile story, mystery, adventure story, coming of age story. All wrapped in to one. Normally, that would be the hall mark of a really bad book. Few authors can accomplish so much in one novel. This one can.The book is intoxicating. From the melodrama of the passionate stories that parallel and infect each other to the bawdy, raucous sexual coming of age, to the pathos of the self-hatred theme that is explored through several characters, this book enthrals. Most importantly, though, it is a book that is fun to read. This is no literary classic that you ""should"" read by won't enjoy. The last 100 pages passed, for me, like 10."
4,A Good Mystery,"Zafon tells a good story. I couldn't put the book down after I was 2/3 through, but it took too long to get to that point. I think he spends too much time describing the names of streets,etc., which can be of particular interest only to those who live or have visited the area. That being said, it is a well crafted mystery and worth the time to get through it."
5,A most memorable read,"This is a wonderful book and memorable in every way. Yes, some can criticize certain aspects, but it is exactly what a good book should be"
5,Enchanting,"This was a ""book club"" pick for me and I had trouble locating a copy at the library in time for our monthly meeting. I ordered the book and it arrived 3 days before the meeting. I figured there would be no way I'd finish in time, but once I opened the front cover, I couldn't put it down! I had the book finished in 36 hours- the story was immediately captivating. Zafon creates the kind of story that appeals to anyone by incorporating humor, intrigue, romance, mystery, history, and literary skills that surpass most American authors. The characters are richly drawn and lovable (or ""hate-able"" in some cases!) and the story is woven so tenderly and with such purpose that the reader almost feels like a part of the intricate web. HIGHLY recommended- easily the best book I've read in years!!"
5,Wonderful read!,Loved this book. I can sometimes chew through 3 books a week and have never written a response- This one was worth the time.
4,The Shadow of the Wind,This is an excellent book. It was sad and yet had such a good storyline. If you like mystery and murder along with faded love you will find the mix here.
5,Great Book,I wont recap the plot as that has already been done but I did want to say that this is a rare find. I could not put it down unitl I finished. Its a page turner from start to finish without the typical cookie cutting ending that often ruins mystery novels.I hope to see more from this author in english soon.
3,Enjoyable--but not deathless literature,"Based on the blurbs, ""The Shadow of the Wind"" was not what I expected. It's not a bit profound, and Lucia Graves' translation seems rather clunky, but if you're in the mood for a florid, gothic entertainment, it's a fun way to pass the time."
2,"This, after all the hype?","I was expecting something really exceptional based on the reviews and what I got was: Pulp fiction sex, violence, and cheesey plot. I tried it, put it down, tried it again, and put it down for good the second time around. How did this get on the New York Times best seller list?"
4,For What it 's Worth,I find it interesting that so many reviewers criticize the novel for being too long and then go on to write reviews that are too long. I'm sure much of the criticism stems from the fact that it is a translation. Just read it and know that you will not be wasting your time if you do. And know that for six friends from Atlanta who read it it and loved it was the impetus for our trip to Barcelona the year after. Any book that can do that is worth the read.
3,Lost in Translation?,"I was ecstatic when I first started reading this book. Finally I had found another ""Name of the Rose."" Unfortunately, about half way through I couldn't help but notice the accumulation of cliche phrases - that we'll all heard before, too many times - where it seemed that a little more effort on the writer's or translator's part would have worked so much better. Given how many of these cliches I found, I can't imagine that they are also in the original text. What chance is there that the Spanish have the same cliches as we do, but in their native tongue? Thus, I credit this issue with the translator.Also in the second half I started to find long narratives, explaining the story, as if the author felt too rushed to tell us the story through active scenes. Yes, the narrative is in one of the character's voices, but that doesn't excuse the lack of drama.All in all it's a very interesting story. But I will not keep it as one of my treasures to read again."
3,Gothic soap,"I've read the Spanish edition. I can tell you it's been a runaway success; most people I have talked to liked it. But I didn't. It's well written, and the characters are well described and likable, but, at the end of the day, it is a Gothic soap opera. Lots of unknown relations, ghoulish cops, disfigured good guys, mansions in the darkness during a hailstorm... 3/4 into the novel, you expect everybody to have been married and/or in love and/or be the second removed cousin of everybody else.The first half of the novel is the best, it hints to a Gothic-soap spoof; but, in the second half, it fully falls into being a Gothic soap.This novel owes a lot to ""City of prodigies"", by Eduardo Mendoza, which is far better."
3,Disappointing,"Ths is a 200 page story told in 500 pages. The book drifts aimlessly, and is driven primarily by coincidences and parallel stories that are so heavy-handed as to be slightly embarrassing.The main character ages from 12 to 18, but always speaks with the voice of a middle aged man.The idea that you have to find your own life in the search of another's is a well-worn, but useable idea. In my opinion, the masterpiece of this genre is ""The book of Illusions"" by Paul Auster. If you've read Auster's work, then The Shadow and The Wind is, as the title suggests, long-winded and rather vaguely defined."
4,A unique mystery- a delightful read,You have to be patient reading this novel. The plot is tightly woven - it unfolds like peeling an onion - layer by layer. You'll learn of Barcelona and Spanish customs.
3,"Exciting read, disappointing end","On the on hand, Shadow of the Wind is an incredibly exciting read. The storyline flows with enough suspense to keep the reader engaged throughout. My disappointment came toward the end. Most of the story was untangled in one single revelation that was just way too convenient. Unfortunately, Zafon did not take enough time and effort to properly untangle the web he so masterfully woven. Oh, and I also had a slight problem with an all-too-happy end."
1,"Very disappointing - too long, boring & predictable","I was extremely disappointed after finally finishing this book. I found it predictable and just plain boring. Halfway through it got a little more exciting, but keep in mind that was 250 pages in! I felt that it had to have some redeeming qualities to get such rave reviews, so I pushed on. Should have gone with my instincts and just let it go."
2,time wasted,"Predictable, meandering plot that objectifies women. It's poorly translated as well. I only finished this book because it was selected by my book club(without my input). The characters are flat & the melodramatic plot is adolescent at best."
3,Not sure the Hype is better than the book,"Read the reviews and thought that I would give the series a read. I kind of liked the story but found it extremely heavy going to start and move through. You get swept up in the convolutions that add to the story, but happen in such a way that it is kind of like using a tornado to describe a breeze. The end wasn't overly predicable but you could see the parrallels between each timeline characters and it was either going to go one way or another. Just didn't grab me completely"
5,"Dark, magical novel set in post-civil war Spain","This book was hard for me to get into, but once I did I found it magical and memorable. It tells the story of a young, aspiring writer named Daniel Sampere whose life is changed forever when he comes into possession of a dark, one-of-a-kind book called Shadow of the Wind by a vanished writer named Julian Carax. Surrounded by a haunting world still tinged by the Spanish Civil War, Daniel finds his life becoming increasingly entwined with that of the doomed Carax.The deeper Daniel digs to uncover the mysteries of Julian's life and disappearance, the more dark secrets are revealed about his own world.Shadow of the Wind is a beautiful story that probably would never be written by an American, but translates extremely well. It reminded me a bit of the movie Pan's Labyrinth in the sense that it's dark, magical, and in some ways tells the story of the Spanish Civil War. I can see this becoming a movie as well."
3,Fun but a little silly,"A fun, superbly written book about a kid in Barcelona whose life-story becomes unexpectedly intertwined with a mysterious missing and presumably dead writer. I would give more stars if it wasn't unintentionally silly at times. Like the portion near the end where a sideline-character explains everything, including things she couldn't possibly know, as though she is herself writing a literary account. Also, the women in the book are a little...um...objectified? Maybe that's how it was in Spain. I don't know. But I loved how the book really draws you in and makes you feel like you know Barcelona."
5,Very entertaining but macabre,I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The literary prose was intriguing I highlighted quite a lot while reading it.
4,Epic mystery,Ruiz's multi-layered plot made me want to read to uncover the ultimate truth of Daniel's quest. Ruiz's villains can rank with other prototypes who frustrate and thwart their protagonists.
5,Shadow of the Wind,This book was highly recommended to me by a friend and I loved it. The book has a tale with a parallel tale going on at the same time and it was wonderful to realize that. Very satisfying novel.
3,Shadow of the Wind - gothic literary thriller,"Carlos Ruiz Zafon's The Shadow of the Wind starts with a scene that will hook any bibliophile: Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, takes him to the cemetary for forgotten books. In this dusty maze of towering stacks and overflowing shelves, Daniel picks the book that he must protect from obscurity forever, a task that pits Daniel against a madman determined to destroy the book.It's a fantastic premise, and Zafon's beautiful use of language will make you want to stop and re-read passages along the way. But this book is very dark. It draws the reader into a world of ghosts, haunted mansions, asylums, secret pasts, fated lovers, bloodshed, vengence and more. It was too depressing, too disturbing for my tastes. Although the plot was very clever in the way that Daniel's life begins to parallel that of the author he is sworn to protect, the book never lived up to its first few scenes, in my opinion."
5,amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this was such a great book!!!!!!!!!! i could not put it down! would highly reccomend this to everyone!!!
2,The shadow of the hype,"With so many rave reviews out there, Zafon doesn't stand a chance. This book was an enjoyable distraction, but I read most of it the way I read articles in People Magazine, with my ears tuned more to the outside world than the inner world of the novel. Full of predictable surprises and the creaking door of a ""scary"" plot, Zafon's novel is drizzled lightly with metafictional hocus pocus about forgotten books and labyrinthine libraries. While the nods to Borges, Eco, Marquez, and Dickens made me buy and read the book, they ultimately made me long for the originals. They are unforgettable: this book, alas, will disappear in the recesses of my memory almost as quickly as my second (and every other) novel by Steven King."
3,A B- for Zafon,"The Publisher's Weekly review and the one by Steve Koss have it about right. The book's concept and plot are intriguing, but the quality of the writing and some completely implausible incidents and details don't hold up to close attention. That said, I read all 470 pages and finished them feeling torn between being satisfied to see how it all ended and thinking that I'd wasted my time. If you don't expect or demand a literary quality of writing and if you can suspend disbelief, it's a pretty fun ride."
5,Excellent Read!,"This book was so much better than I thought it would be. It was full of twists and turn, many that totally blew me out of the water. Often, in books and in movies, you can kind of form your own idea of how its going to end. Not with this book. Everyone of my theories was wrong, but in a good way. It was amazing how Ruiz Zafon tied so many of the characters together, without making it seem like it was a stretch. Each character, no matter if their piece was large or small, had an impact on how the story came together. I highly recommend this book! Excellent, excellent read."
1,drek...,Reading this is a bit like biting into a gigantic cream-puff. One that somehow manages to be both undeniably stale and unreliably sweet. There it sits uneasily. You paid for it. Now you've got to eat it. Or do you? 500 plus pages of derivative drek. With all the luminous reviews one can only conclude that people no longer know what they are reading or why they are bothering. And those comparisons...oh my Lord.
1,Dreadful Cliche,"I hated this novel. I kept reading, not knowing why, except perhaps I was trying to convince myself that no book could be this bad. Well, this one is. The plot is a winding, painful road filled with cliches, predictable situations, and purple metaphors that are painful to read.The characters are pure stereotypes, flat and static. Perhaps the depth was lost in translation, but somehow I doubt it. I cannot for the life of me understand what people see in this book. I, for one, finished it irritated and ready to read anything, and I mean anything, else."
1,The Shadow of the Wind,"I finally gave up on this book halfway through it. I kept reading that long because of all the favorable reviews. But, halfway through, I still didn't care about any of the characters or even the plot. It is a very ""wordy"" book with a confusing list of characters. I lost track of who characters were and how they fit into the story. It certainly did not live up to to hype."
5,Simply an Excellent Novel,"I adore Carlos Ruiz Zafon. He is one of my favorite authors writing today. Until I discovered his paperback version of Shadow of the Wind on a cold December day, I was only reading and re-reading classic literature.Thank you for this fantastic tale and others Carlos!! I look forward to more books by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. What a treat to read this author!"
4,Can you handle it?,"The Shadow of the wind is a book that can incorporate many different interests. The book includes some mystery and some love story and everything in between. The plot of the story is very complex and it can be tough to follow. A problem that I had was reading the book and then not picking it up for a week or so. This made it nearly impossible to remember everything that happened. The text requires the reader to focus on the story line very carefully.Once finishing the novel and reviewing I found it to be very interesting. After realizing some of the connections that I didn't pick up on the first time, I had an epiphany and saw where the book was trying to go. The novel will keep you reading. I would suggest this book to someone who likes a long drawn out plot opposed to a quick read (both are good)."
5,Truly great storytelling,"A second-hand bookseller takes his young son, Daniel, to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret library that preserves volumes that would otherwise be lost forever. This event will result in a years-long quest for more information about an elusive author who mysterious life parallels young Daniel's in many ways.Carlos Luis Zafon's novel is big, gorgeous storytelling, full of passion. The many characters have fascinating backstories that intertwine in unexpected ways, resulting in a very rich plot. Fermin, a profane but courageous homeless former spy who become a loyal ally of Daniel, is one of my favorites, both for his great love of life and for the many hilarious comments he makes during the course of the story. This is a masterwork of Gothic melodrama that revolves around the world of books and writing, an irresistible milieu for anyone who cherishes reading."
4,Not quite what I expected,"Zafon's Shadow of the Wind starts out strong and hooked me early...always a good sign. Our Spanish protagonist Daniel is swept into a mystery over the author of a series of obscure books. He's pursued by an even more mysterious figure who is trying to destroy the very books that Daniel has become enamored of. And there's the mystery: what became of the author? Who's pursuing Daniel? Why is someone destroying these books?At first, it seemed as though this was going to be a tale with twists of magical realism. Instead, it turned out to be a fairly straight forward love story (albeit with a complicated, twisting plot). Expecting something slightly supernatural, I was a little disappointed by this. However, it's a well-written tale and entertaining enough."
4,Excited,I am so excited that i recieved this book i read the reviews online and seen some pretty good reviews on it. i ordered it for my book club and is excited to see what they think. it came in a day early than the estimated date which is fine the sooner the better and the book was in great protection
4,Superb!,"When you thought you knew what was happening, the author made more twists and turns that would keep you guessing and wanting you to read more. There are so many colorful characters and so much drama, love, suspense, hatred, action, and mystery!I think, at times, it seemed a bit long. And in the beginning I had a bit of trouble getting in to it. But when I did, I couldn't put it down!"
5,Translator deserves credit...,"I absolutely loved this book. It did take me a few chapters to get into it, but after that I could not put it down. What I most want to mention however, is how impressed i was with the translation. I have read many translated works, and something about the language always feels a bit off. This book's language and writing was stunning, which I have never encountered in a translated work."
5,Gorgeous and well-crafted,"I am a hard to please reader. I want a novel with character development, clever use of literary devices; it should be lyrical at times, employing the perfect word at the perfect time, with extended metaphors, sprinklings of similes that aid the ever unfolding details. The Shadow of the Wind does all of this while delivering a mystical, historic, erotic tale."
2,I do not understand the appeal of this book,"I started this book with high expectations because I had heard many good things about it. I was warned to ""stick with it"" because it was fairly slow at the beginning. Jeesh I thought it was unbearably slow for nearly 300 pages. Something about it made me plod through it. There was something compelling about it that made me finish it. Having said that I would not recommend it. It just was not worth the time invested in reading it."
2,Too many... Too much...,Too many useless twists and convenient connections between charactors. Too many pregnant teenage girls with enraged fathers. Too much pointless secrecy between people who claim to be seeking the same end when a little information sharing would have cleared things right up. And too much rain. Apparently the rain in Spain falls constantly.
3,"Good, not great....","There were so many things about this book that I enjoyed -- the translation, for starters, which I thought was wonderful -- but while I enjoyed it overall, I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone I know, and therefore I can only give it 3 stars instead of 4. (Never 5.) I enjoyed the novel, despite its predictability and lack of suspense. Fermin was a delightful character, I thought, and I enjoyed the idea of the endless cemetery/repository of books. A good ""beach read,"" I've heard it called, and maybe that's the best description for it."
2,Beautiful Words Cover the Lack of Great Story,"Initially, the words hooked me. The translation is a pleasure to read, and so I imagine credit belongs to Lucia Graves. But the story is lacking for me. The focus is all on forbidden love, TV soap-opera style -- completely forgettable and a waste of time by the end."
3,"Great start, weak finish","This book promises a lot more in the first half than it is able to deliver in its second half. Zafon vividly sketches about a dozen major characters in 1940s Barcelona but they become less and less believable as he pushes them toward the finish line. By the end, it seems like every single encounter is dominated by moody Silences of the Doomed.Plus, despite its setting, the book has almost nothing to say about the Catalan people, which is quite an amazing feat for a book set in Barcelona!"
3,A book of books,"This was a good read and I enjoyed it, but I did not think the quality was as fabulous as many others did. Some of the character development was superb (you will love Fermin), but others were very black and white, bordering on caricature. Good people were sooo good and bad people were sooo bad. The cemetery of books was a marvelous concept and you will enjoy its role in the book. Fun guessing how it will all work out. Some of the plot seems a little contrived. For instance, why Clara? What role did she serve? All the characters get tied up with pretty bows at the end, which may irritate some and may give others good closure. It is an excellent translation."
4,"Formulaic, but very well executed.","I do agree that this novel is a bit over-hyped, and probably poorly compared with some higher literature. However, despite all my cynicism, I was very charmed by this book.While this story did not hold many surprises for me, and yes, perhaps there is some validity one can infer to the ""soap opera"" references, it is well executed just the same. Zafon is clearly a very talented writer, the translation is absolutely beautiful, and the characters and setting provided a pleasant escape.Do not take this work too seriously, enjoy the long ride and lush scenery. Do not let the hype or comparisons taint your expectations and you will enjoy this novel for what it is. Not timeless literature, but a nice diversion nonetheless.I found this book reminded me of the films Malena, A Very Long Engagement and Cinema Paradiso, and was not surprised to find Zafon has written screenplays. If given to a capable, foreign director, this would be on par with those films."
5,Bravo!!,"I have been lucky this summer, every book I had been saving on my nightstand to read after school got out has been excellent. The Shadow of the Wind probably is the best.I won't go into details about the plot, many here have said everything there is to say and probably better than I could. I liked the plot fine and I liked the idea of the cemetary for books - but I LOVED the writing. I found myself rereading sentences or passages just because they were so beautiful. There have been few books I could say that about and I have been an avid reader for over 50 years."
5,Incredible,"Some books just make you want to cry, not necessarily because they're sad, but because of the beauty of the story. This is one of those novels. It is an intricately woven story that has it all. Mystery, romance and deep, dark secrets that come together in the end. In one word, Incredible."
5,utterly fantastic,"The book was gripping, memorable--dark and haunting. I loved every second of it. I can't wait to read more of this author! If you are on the fence, just do it--you will not be disappointed, but if you don't...you will always wonder..."
5,Worth the read.,I gained a lot of insight from this book: don't ever give up on yourself. The book did seem a bit long-winded at one point but it was totally worth reading through to the end.
2,Harry Potter's Excellent Adventure-R rated,"It's all here: mendacious characters who have been physically scarred by the elements, misty alleys giving way to haunted crypts, labyrinths that lead to literary dead ends, Magical libraries guarding the Truth, loyal side kicks who provide the only light notes of humor, and women tricked up as angels, madonnas or whores...Young man loses his innocence.!..Shifting political paradigms of revolution...Good versus evil...Never trust the guy in a sailor suit!Marguez? Borges? Dickens? EGAD! All I can say: BURN THIS BOOK!"
2,Spanish kitsch,"It's hard to know what to make of this book -- it's a cross between a modern bodice-ripper, a nineteenth-century Italian opera, and Casablanca. Overblown, overlong, overcomplicated, overdetailed, over-dramatic, over the top in almost every respect. I listened to the audio tape, and the occasional tinkling piano music (composed by the author, we learn at the end) added to the overall effect. If you like misty streets, dark lowering clouds, eternal love, Spanish passion, unwitting incest, endless detail and a totally improbable story-line, then this is the book for you. My favorite line in the entire book, about the disfigured spectre who haunts the streets of Barcelona -- ""I wanted to kiss him. . . but he had no lips."""
2,The emperor has no clothes,"This book was so hailed by reviewers I trust - now I think everyone is afraid to tell the truth. A crashing bore of a book, it moves sluggishly along, trying to be a heady page-turner - made my brain feel as though it had been explosed to a drying agent."
1,Amazingly horrible,"I had very high expectations for this book, having seen all the very positive reviews, but I was very disappointed. I kept hoping the book would finally get better, but it never did. :("
1,3rd rate novel,"I couldn't bear to finish it after torturing myself to continue in hope that 700-odd reviewers who gave high rate were right in some sense. It was too painful and too clear into the half of the book that the hopes were misplaced. If you are aiming to kill time, take a nap."
2,It became progressively boring,"A good friend of mine loaned me this book. ""Feel free to keep it after you're done"", she said. I thought she was being very generous. Now I know why she didn't need it back: it is utterly boring.To be fair, the first 200-300 pages are interesting. The story and the characters are unusual. The quest of a young boy and his uncle for the lone copy of a book by Julian Carax are (or I should say: could have been) extremely appealing. So I kept on reading, hoping that a mid-point in the book, something would happen. Well, it did: Half-way through,I was so completely confused by the labyrinthine plot that I forgot where I was, and why I was there. (Not good, especially when some readers may think you are the next Gabriel Garcia Marquez).In short, if you are curious about it, get it from a library or at used book store. You might find my copy there because I promptly traded it in."
5,Shadow of the Wind,"Great story,written in the traditional lyrical style of Spanish authors. Easy to read even though it contains complex plots. Holds your interest, the type of book you never want to put down. Keeps you reading well past your bedtime!"
4,The Shadow of the Wind,"Well written with some lovely prose and pithy descriptions of human emotions. It did drag a little in the middle for me,and was a very dark view of Barcelona (cold, rainy, depressing) which was a sunny, warm vibrant city during my visits."
5,Best novel I've ever read!,Carlos Ruiz Zafon is a truly gifted writer. His prose is beautiful and he certainly knows how to weave a story.
5,absorbing,"absorbing, well written, page turnerjust visited Barcelona - may familiar siteswell developed characters and engaging story lineenjoy!"
4,Brilliant,"How different is this book? I don't give 5 stars on any book as I believe everything can be improved but this is definitely a 4.5 star book. This is one of those very rare books that you know will live in your soul for ever. I was on holidays when I came across it in the holiday house library. We had to leave before I was finished and the very first thing I did when I got home was log on and order it. This is great literature and I highly, highly recommend it."
3,Shadow of the Wind,"This was a classic story in the genre of Dickens, for example. However, it was very long, had tooo many characters and was hard to follow at times because of the two lives it covered.It did lead to a good discussion at book club and all members enjoyed it."
5,A fascinating but very dark story,"A fascinating story told with tremendous erudition and verve. There are quotable quotes on almost every page.The complex plot, unique characters, descriptions and aphoristic remarks all rate 5 stars.Riveting to the end.Caveats: It portrays a very dark almost cynical view of life without happy endings. Parts resemble a gothic horror thriller.The author has an imagination I can only compare to Dumas, but unlike Dumas, Zafon often goes over the top.(One can love extremely rich food, but a chef who puts every spice in his cabinet into the stew will choke the most adventureous palate.)The reader starts to suspend disbelief and thinks about the author's method: His immagination is in overdrive and he seems to throw every outrageous idea that comes to his mind onto the page.I will highly recommend. But I will embark on a strict and lengthy diet before I will try Zafon's next novel."
3,Wonderful use of language but disappointing plot,"This book starts out with an engaging premise and an appealing narrator, a ten year-old boy. The author's prose is lyrical, and so much admired by this wordsmith that I was certain I was going to love the book to the end. Unfortunately, I was soon disappointed.I found the plot unnecessarily convoluted and involved too many characters. Each time I picked up the novel and turned to my bookmarked page, I had to re-read the previous half a dozen pages to put myself back into the scene and remind myself of the who's whos. If an avid reader has to do that, there is something wrong with the writing. As the novel progressed, the plot became so blatantly melodramatic and predictable that my frustrations mounted. By the end, I just wanted to get through to the final page so that I could open my next novel.For me, the battered, homeless hero remains an unforgettable character, and perhaps the book is worth reading for that image alone."
5,Enchanting,"A book that seems like it was waiting for you since before you were born. A brilliant conception, masterfull execution, with a translation that is simply a blessing. Fermín is a character both from the ages and for the ages.Certainly better than any book by Arturo Perez-Reverte, whose books I have enjoyed."
1,I have not ever recieved this book. where is it?,My credit card was debited but i have not received this book! Thankyou for your attention in this matter.
2,I have to agree...,"...with the 2 star/1 star reviews. I don't know why this has so many raves. I'm half way through and will probably finish as I don't have anything great in the wings to read, but I'm beginning to skip bits as they are so repetitively dark, Gothic, overwrought and, yes as others have said lurid. For instance the story of Jacinta (in the institution) was just too over-the-top with the mystical, ghost ridden, devil cursed, awful fortune she'd had to live through. Why should I live through it too? Maybe once, but we've been there with that a few times already in this book. Just don't care about these folks, don't believe in them, the magical realism is neither real nor magical and the mystery is in no way compelling. Yes, I agree--don't bother."
2,It was a dark and stormy night....,"It seems that this novel polarises readers and i'm afraid that i tend to the south pole more than the north. While the story is calculated to entrance and captivate i agree with the reviewers who were disappointed by the flatness of the characters and the boring predictability of the storyline. What more can i say about a novel full of breathless heroines with heaving bosoms, dastardly cigar-smoking villains, mysterious strangers and comic-relief sidekicks. Comparisons with Eco, Marquez etc are fatuous. This novel would win my nomination for the Bulwer-Lytton purple prose award."
2,A DIFFICULT READ,"I was surprised to read other reviews of how great this book was and how unforgettable. When our Book Club decided to read this, I started to read it and realized I had already read it. It was COMPLETELY forgettable. The tracking of characters took skill and charting by the reader with convoluted twists and turns, not always easily understood. For some reason, I found the book dark and not compelling. I would not recommend!"
5,I loved it!,"I saw this book at my local book store and was attracted by the cover. I really, really loved the book! The caharcters are great, especially the enigmatic, wise,crack up Fermin! The story gets a little predictable in the end, but it is still very enjoyable! I also liked the description of Barcelona during the spanish war and what people had to endure in those years...Final note, I think that the translator did a terrific job!! He's partly responsible if this book is very good!"
4,Shadow of Magnificent,"The prose of this novel is magnificent! (It is a superb translation.) This book, while being both a mystery and a shadowy story, is a mystical journey into intermingled souls."
4,This book is a must!!!!,"A good read. Inventive story line and good pace. If you like a good spook story(ies), this book is for you. Could not put it down. I was reading it so fast, at times I had to re-read a passage just so I can keep up with the plot. As a spanish speaking person I can say the translation was nearly flawless. I liked the hardcopy version of this book since it has maps showing the location of the many places where the action of this book happens. (I don't know if the Kindle version has the maps also). You'll even want to get a passport and visit Spain!"
4,dripping with detail,This story was great the level of description and detail is tremendous. I makes you want to travel to the sights.
4,Great,"Very well written, great description of Barcelona and fantastic mystery! In the end is difficult to stop reading it fo a minute!"
5,Great read!,"I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read more by Zafon. I've recommended it to countless friends and recommend it to you as well. The writing paints an incredible picture and in some of the darker scenes, I had to pull myself away to remember where I was. It's a fascinating and intriguing story and I didn't want to put the book down until I knew what was going to happen. It's a great read...Highly recommended!"
4,"Finally, a literary, mystery romance story!","Having purchased this book on the advice of a friend who raved about it, I did not expect it to live up to her rather effusive praise. After a few chapters, I was hooked by the language, the story, and the questions raised by the author. I literally was riveted to the novel the last 100 pages and constantly surprised by the unconventional twists and turns that the story took that I had not expected. The characters, with a few exceptions, are fully drawn and believable, even if somewhat surreal in some cases. I hesitate to give too much away as you must read the book to appreciate its appeal. I worried about the novel's being a translation, but once I started reading it, never gave that aspect another thought. For a highly unusual and literary read, give this book a try!"
4,One I would recommend...,I am rather particular when it comes to books because not everything grabs my attention. This is a very good book with a story line that will keep your interest. I would recommend this book to my friends.
2,"Slow, Beautiful Writing That Did Nothing For Me","Slow, pointless, unnecessarily complex vocabulary - seemed the author aimed to impress if not by story then by his amazing vocabulary and turn of phrase. For those that like writing for writings sake, this book is great, sip your wine, and enjoy. For those that want a good yarn that grips, squeezes, and maybe leaves a little juice worth drinking in reflection when its all over, this isn't it. The only driving force in this story for me was will power to finish, and the hope that such great writing skill must come with a worthy point by the end of the novel.People that like writing for the sake of clever pros and witty dialog may love this book. In fact, it was emphatically recommended to me by just such a person."
5,Literary Masterpiece,"Carlos Ruiz Zafon has written a magnificent novel; one of the finest I have ever read; a bibliophiles dream. As La Vanguardia wrote: ""It is a thriller, a historical novel, and a comedy of manners, but above all, the story of a tragic love.""A young boy is taken by his bookseller father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, and asked to pick out a title. He must thereafter guard that title against any attempts at destruction. Daniel finds that the book he chooses proves as dangerous to own as it is impossible to forget. I shall defer to the above eloquent plot synopsis by the Washington Post; let us just summarize that The Shadow of the Wind is impossible to put down. Zafon's intense narrative style is pure magic.There is a reason this book screamed to the bestseller lists and remained there for much more than a year in Spain, Germany, and all of Europe prior to its release in the States.Just get it. Don't hesitate. This one is destined to be a classic for centuries."
3,Book Club Book,This was another book for my book club. Not bad but it was not easy reading and not for everyone's taste.
4,Mesmerizing read,I was in awe of the language and setting of this book and it made me appreciate my love for reading more than ever.
4,"Intricate plot, great characters","This book gets better as it goes, with pieces of an intricate puzzle falling into place chapter by chapter. The characters were well defined within a plot that kept luring you on. I look forward to the next installment."
5,love this book,"I have recommended this book to several people and only 1 person didn't like it. So often today books are written without concern for the construction of the words, but only the outcome. This author is a very good writer."
2,Didn't Live up to the Hype,"I realize I'm in the very small minority of readers who didn't fall in love with this story. I tried - I really did! - but couldn't get into the rhythm or the story and gave up after 150 pages. The writing style was formal and a bit florid for my taste and the story didn't engage me - there just wasn't enough there to tantalize me into wanting to pick it back up, always a bad sign.It was slow going and I threw in the towel so I can only tell you about what I did read: the premise is intriguing...a young boy, raised by his antiquarian bookseller father, comes into possession of a mysterious book and its even more mysterious author. As he becomes more involved into solving the disappearance of the book's author, he becomes enmeshed in a world of sinister secrets.Perhaps there was so much hype about this book that when I finally picked it up, my expectations were too high."
2,You get what you pay for...,"The case fits perfectly. I was happy when I received it and used it for a week before the clip broke. If you use it gently, it'll last a reasonable amount of time... mine did not."
2,Bad Fit,"It a nice looking case, though looks a little cheap. Time will tell if it holds up for a few months of normal wear and tear. So I will wait and see on that. However, for the price it appears to be of appropriate build quality. The case I received, unfortunately is slightly too small, so the lip doesn't wrap all the way around. I do have a zagg body on it but that shouldn't make that big of a difference. I guess in the manufacturing process the clearance wasn't made accurately. This makes it so the phone can't sit all the way in and the back of the iPhone isn't flush against the case. Slightly awkward, but we'll see if the plastic stretches."
4,Good price nice case but broke.,Everything is fine about this case but my phone suffered a minor drop and the top left corner broke off. The top edge above the Silent Switch.
1,Cheap case,After a few days the case gets loose and doesn't grip your phone as well. Also the white part gets easily stained/dirty/worn out.
1,B-rocka,This album is off the hook. This a mature more sexy side of Brandy. I have been a fan of her since the very first time I saw her on television.
5,A SPIRITUAL WARRIOR'S JOURNEY: The Inspiring Life Story of a Mystical Warrior,"A Spiritual Warriors Journey was a very enlightening book. It starts off when Bill was a child, then his time in Vietnam, and there after. This was like no other book I have read. He brings out his inner feelings, emotions and really makes the reader delve into their own inner self. Some of the events are phenominal, and very spiritual, and at times heart warming. The places he has traveled and people he has met will leave a lasting memory. Excellent read."
5,Excellent,Book is in good condition and really fast in delivery. Amazing Amazon ! Tons of better than E-Bay...
5,the best,"The MERCK Veterynary Manual is the best book that a vet practitioner or a student can have 'cause inside you find the most important informations you'll need about the deseases, clsificated in chapters. Easy to find and easy to use!!!!"
5,Excellent Reference,"Excellent Specifics on hundreds of topics, the best reference book a vet tech can have."
2,Virtually no coverage of Bartonella-related diseases,Cannot believe that there is almost no coverage of Bartonella and subspecies related ailments in cats and dogs in this manual.
4,Merck's Veterinary Manual,"Packed with valuable up-to-date information. However, the section on prescription and treatment has been missing."
4,Something about everything,"The Merck Veterinary Manual is a very good first hand explanation about basically every disease or disorder your animal may get. The down side for us non-veterinarians is that it is written for veterinarians so you may have to look up a lot of scientific terms and Latin names for bacteria ... You also have to know the diagnosis because you need the name of the disease or disorder to be able to find it in this book (you would have to know it by heart to be able to ""diagnose"" the problem yourself. But at the end of the book short - some pages long - descriptions and useful information for all kinds ""domestic"" animals is added so you may also find some basic information how to handle your ""pet"" very quickly."
4,homeowner experience,"It does alert you if there is power in an exposed wire before you start working on it. you have to get the pen tip about half an inch close to th wire, much easier and faster than using a voltmeter. but it could not detect electric wires behing a drywall."
4,"Sensitive, loud, long battery life","Quite sensitive, will indicate hot AC voltage at 1/2 to 1"" away. I always have it with me when working on AC electrical circuits. Seems quite robust.The beeper is quite loud, little possibility of missing it. And it's easy to test the battery - there should be a beep when you first press the clasp - no beep, don't rely on it.I needed a second tester, so I recently bought a Hioki 3120 based on good reviews. You may prefer the on/off strategy - this one lights green and stays on when the batteries are good and it's turned on. Then it flashes red when near a hot circuit. It's slightly less sensitive than the GVD-504A - for instance, when touched to the exterior of a switch that is turned off it does not show hot. This could be good, could be bad. Your choice.Yes, it uses watch type batteries, but with occasional use mine has lasted for years, so this is not really an issue. It's only 'on' when you press the clasp, so really it's rarely on."
4,Gardner Bender Voltage Tester,I order more than one of the tester as I use them regularly in my profession. I did not received the exact model shown in the picture. I'm hoping the ones I did receive have the same reliability as the model shown. I have not tried this model just yet but I have used this brand for over 10 years.
2,Unreliable design,"I purchased the GVD-504A and was very disappointed with it. In fact, I was so disappointed, I purchased a different unit.This one is sitting in the junk pile.Here are the reasons:1) There is no positive on/off switch - you have to press on the clip to turn it on. This is the main design flaw with this unit.If you don't make a good contact it can be off while you're testing and not chirp. This is a terrible design and is, in my opinion, dangerous! My new unit has a positive on/off switch. You just twist and it's on. When you're done you twist it back and it's off.2) Requires 2 watch type batteries. These are expensive to replace and harder to find. My new unit takes standard AA or AAA batteries (I can't remember which) that are cheap and easy to come by.Overall I would recommend passing on this unit."
5,One of my all-time favorite cd's,"If I were stranded on a desert island, this is the cd I would want with me. It has beautiful love songs such as ""Casablanca"" and ""Palm Beach,"" as well as uptempo numbers such as ""Jamaica Me Crazy"" and ""Brasilia."" I've loved Bertie Higgins' music ever since his debut album in the early 80's, and I pounced on this greatest hits when it came out. The debut single ""Blue Never Looked Good On You"", is a classic love ballad that would make even Dan Fogelberg proud. Anyone who ever liked ""Key Largo"" or ""Just Another Day In Paradise"" will love this cd."
4,Really gets you sweatin'!,This is a great video if you like to dance.I loved it. Some of the moves remind me of my highschool cheerleading days.But it is tricky to learn at first. Just stick with it and once you get it you'll be on your way to burning lots of fat!
1,the worst tape I own,The instructors in the tape spend almost the whole time demonstrating the steps so when you finally put them all together you don't get much of a workout.
3,Not as fun as the others in this series,"I love the other Grind videos because they're so fun and hip, but mostly because they have real music that gets me hoppin'. But this one has wannabe music by some d.j. and it gets really annoying after awhile."
2,"Too much teaching, not enough workout","The dancing in the video is very interesting, but it takes them so long to teach the moves there is no time to workout"
2,Extreme coordination needed!,This video was extremely difficult to follow and dragged on and on. The time it takes to teach the difficult dance steps takes too long. I didn't even work up a sweat.
2,Short and too easy,"Although this video has some fun moves, it is short for a workout. In addition it is difficult to maintain an elevated heart rate for more than a few minutes as they keep having to go very slow to break down the moves. Also, they don't lead you through any additional exercises - they show a series of exercises briefly for you to do at some later time but that's it."
1,"Lame workout, poorly presented","Few people will be able to work up a sweat with this video, which is misleadingly called an aerobic workout. The moves it presents have very little exercise value, and the flow of the workout is continuously interrupted by demos and conversation.The script for this video makes the presenters seem dull and shallow. For example, one of the guys keeps telling the audience he's sweating. Well, good for him. No one else is."
2,Not for Beginners!,"I was looking for a workout that incorporated great music and dance movements but this one was way beyond my skills ability. I found the pace was way too fast and that the directions to 'just keep re-winding the tape until you get the steps' really curbed my enthusiasm. Also, this is not a tape to use if you don't have considerable floor space that has a great view of the T.V. (apartment dwellers, etc.). After kicking the couch a few times, I'm afraid I just packed this tape away. On the plus side, the music was good and the performers had a high level of enthusiasm (although I would say that appreciating Eric Nies' personality must be an 'acquired taste')"
3,Pretty Good,"At first, the only workout I was getting was in my thumb from having to rewind so much. I consider myself pretty coordinated, but it was tricky following most of the moves at first. The camera jumps & rotates around a lot--fine if it were just an MTV music video, but distracting when you're trying to learn from the dancers (who also never quite explain which direction they're moving or which foot/arm to use--and they're never shot from behind).I figured it out after about a week and then it got to be kind of fun. All that talk & attitude eventually gets annoying, but Eric *is* a cutie and all the rest are inspiring to see too."
4,"A fun, great workout!","I bought this video because I was bored staring at a wall while running on my treadmill and using my stationary bike. Let me tel you... this is a lot more interesting! I have had a lot of fun learning the dance routine. The first 2 times you do the workout, you might have to rewind the video occasionally if you miss a step, but it's not too difficuly, especially if you like to dance. While this is no super cardio workout, it's still works you some... and it's well worth the time.I especially like how they break it into half-time so you can get all the steps just right. Another part that I loved was how all the steps offer space for you to ""add your own flavor"" (translation= shake it!) and do whatever you want.I recommend this video! It's no intense workout, but it makes me sweat and I have a great time!"
1,Grind Workout: Dance Club Aerobics,"Two Thumbs Down! Don't waste your money! The dance steps are hard to follow. I got sick of it after 10 minutes. You have to stand around for a minute ot two wainting for the next person to teach you another dance step, which of course you can't possibly follow!"
1,dancers only need apply,Dancers only Need apply. As far as a work out video goes this has so many weaknesses that its not worth recommending.
1,Not Recommended,When I first popped this tape in I thought it was going to be fun. I actually liked their warm-up but the actual workout was absolutely terrible. It was very confusing and you don't even get a good workout. I wouldn't recommend this tape to anyone.
1,mid-price -- low performance,"Range is very short, even less than the 100 feet specified in the manufacturer's (limited) specs. More like 60 feet, even with a clear path between base and remote. Humidity sensors' accuracy is terrible, sometimes being off by as much as 14 percentage points. Needs a rain gauge to be a complete unit. No backlight, impossible to see in low light. Makes a good clock, calendar and indoor thermometer, though. I'll be upgrading this unit to an Oregon or LaCross very soon. Not at all happy with it."
1,Acurite 00594A4 weather Station:,Chaney Instrument mailed me a replacment weather station a few weeks ago and I'm sorry to say it is worse then the old Unit. It works when the sensors are next to one another but when I move them away no signal !The wind speed sensor fails to function from a distance of 25 feet line of sight from the main Unit. Tried resetting It three times no help !!Chaney customer support said to try a series of steps to see If It would function correctly. I tried there steps. It doesn't work.I have now written them on three occassions and I'm still waiting to hear from them. In the mean time I re-Installed the original Unit and the wind sensor works perfectly but Isn't accurate.I would think twice before purchasing there Unit.
1,Not worth It,"From the beginning the wind sensor has never worked correctly or displayed consistenly no matter how close I place it to the receiver. Also, the time is constantly resets incorrectly even after setting manually."
2,Annemometer bearings,"Generally the unit has functioned as we expected with the hexception of the annemometer. We noticed that the windspeed was always indicated to be substantially less that we expected. One day I noticed why. The annemometer hanges below the direction indicator (weathervane). As the wind came up, the annemometer cup assembly began wobbling violently so that rather than turn in time with the wind, it was wobbling and gyrating oddly on its own. It is apparent that any bearings that had ever been present are no longer functional. It is still on my house but we do not trust the wind speed indication."
2,not reliable,"When I found this weather station at Wal*mart. I was in for a dissapointment. The wind never got over 16 MPH, and the humidity after3 months read to high (98%). And the station is low in functions. Meaning no rain gauge, no lcd backlighting, and lousily built. The station gave good air pressure reading for the first year I had it. Then the graph started to constantly show steady bars. Even when the alt was set. And for some reason the alarms go for no reason. When the conditions were normal. And the atomic clock was off by 10 secondes. wile the time zone was set. I now have an Oregon Scientific wmr100, Puts Acu-Rite to shame."
5,Gory Enough for All,"A useful and vivid study of the largest all-cavalry battle in the Civil War. The author's trenchant criticism of Sheridan is especially interesting as he does most of his work on Michigan cavalry--thus can't be accused of Southern partisanship. It's a long and detailed account, including plenty of quotes for human interest as well as an assessment of the battle's tactical and strategic import. In a larger context, it works well to fill a gap--cavalry actions get less scholarship than I think they should--and to offer a perspective on Sheridan that differs slightly from the norm."
3,"it's a sign, but it's tiny","i live on a dead end road, thought this would be good to put up.... i'm still going to put it up. but it isn't anywhere near the size of a legit road sign.... went back and looked and it says 12 x 12, well there weren't lying. if you are looking at this to put up as a real sign, keep looking. this is painted yellow, but it's not reflective yellow.... it appears to be ok, that is if you are looking for a novelty item."
2,"Works great, until it breaks","I've had this about a year now and I probably make coffee once a week on average. So, I've brewed around 50 pots, and I've been very happy with the results. The coffee is excellent, and the parts are all easy to clean. I've found the coffee stays hot for 2-3 hours after brewing. This is my first venture into a thermal coffee maker and I'm happy I made the swtich.Bottom line is there's nothing to complain about with this coffee maker, and I would recommend it to anyone.UPDATE: This coffee maker stopped producing decent coffee after less than 2 years. My theory is that the element failed and it wasn't getting the water up to the proper temperature, hence the watered down coffee. Reducing to 2 stars since it had a short lifespan for the money."
2,Timer,"Very disappointed in Braun for not adding a timer to this coffeemaker. The carafe is excellent and improves the taste of the coffee. The warming plate shuts off after 17 minutes so expect to come back to a ""warm"" cup of coffee. If you like your Java...find another product!"
4,"Excellent coffee, sinple operation","Makes great coffee, carafe keeps it nice and hot. Only drawback is that inside of carafe is impossible to clean without using some kind of sponge-on-a-stick gadget."
3,YOU NEED TO READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"This coffee maker works very well. However, there is one teeny-weeny little detail for a ten-cup coffee maker: The carafe supplied with it DOES NOT HOLD TEN CUPS. If you fill the reservoir up to the nine-cup or ten-cup level marked on the side of the machine, then all the liquid will not fit into the carafe. The CARAFE HOLDS ONLY EIGHT STANDARD CUPS. The result of this is that once the carafe is full with eight cups, the brewing basket overflows, either leaking grounds into your coffee carafe, or (in extreme cases) plugging up the drip point with grounds and spewing the extra two cups of hot coffee mixed with grounds all over your countertop (and ruining your pot of coffee, to boot).The maker is well-engineered for an eight-cup maker, to be sure. It is hard to believe that such an obvious misrepresentation (the capacity it holds) made it through the company's review process. Blame it on marketing!"
4,Good product,"Everything about this product is great, except we feel the coffee is a bit mild in temperature when served. This morning we tried to warm up the jar by pouring hot tap water prior to brewing, and it worked. Perhaps the jar gets fairly cold overnight, and hot coffee becomes mild unless the jar is pre-heated? Haven't really nailed down the problem, but overall we are very satisfied with the product."
5,Braun Thermal Carafe coffee maker,"This is my last coffee maker; it is without a doubt the least complicated and best design for brewing drip coffee of all the various different brands I've owned. It is my last because it's built like a brick outhouse; this sucker will never crap out.If I have one carp, it is that the viewing window for the water is on the wrong side and the amount doesn't reach the 10 cup level (I suspect this is due to the water filter, but I can't be sure). An on/off switch with an auto-off feature, a gold-plated filter basket, a double-walled stainless steel carafe, solid drip mechanism - all a maker of drip coffee could ask."
3,OK Coffeemaker,"This is an ok coffeemaker. I initially bought it because I wanted to keep my coffee hot without scorching so I thought the carafe would be perfect, however it does not keep the coffee hot and I wind up microwaving to heat it up, even as soon as 10 minutes after brewing.For the price it's a decent coffeemaker and easy to use, but if you're looking for a carafe to keep your coffee hot for an extended period I would look elsewhere."
3,It makes coffee,"It makes good coffee, I don't like the gold filter as it lets the small dust size grounds through. I put a paper filter inside it and the coffee is clean. I am a purked coffee kinda guy but this machine is Ok when time is not on my side"
5,Lukewarm coffee is not an issue....,"I read some of these reviews with trepidation - the last thing I wanted to do was waste $70.00 or so on a coffee maker that made lousy and/or lukewarm coffee. My last thermal coffee maker was a Black and Decker and the water pump failed one time too many for me. I wanted to get something a little more reliable and durable. Seemed like all of the reviews on the KF600 were either very good or very bad... Maybe some defective machines out there?.... Anyway, I crossed my fingers and purchased the KF600 today - put it through 2 water cycles then gave it a shot - The coffee is great - the temperature couldn't be hotter - and I didn't even heat the pot. Came back to it 2 hours later and it was still just as hot. I filled the water to 8 and added 4 scoops of coffee and it came out strong enough for me - and I hate weak coffee. I guess I got a good one. My advice - give this machine a try - seems like a winner."
3,Makes good coffee but...,"The Braun KF600 is a nice looking appliance which makes a good cup of coffee but it has some shortcomings that you should consider before buying. The major fault, in my opinion, is although advertised as a ""ten cup"" brewer it in fact makes only 40 ounces of coffee. Who drinks a four ounce cup of coffee? If, like me, you have normal person 8 oz. cups then you will only get five cups maxium. The last cup will be a little shy because the gold tone filter passes a few grounds which you will not enjoy at the bottom of the pot.The pot is metal... very difficult to clean as the hole in the top is too small for your hand. You will need a round brush on a handle and stainless does need frequent cleaning. The pot does keep the coffee nice and warm for a long time... still I like to pop my cup into the micro for a quick shot of heat. So... consider other choices if my complaints would cause you to frown."
2,warm coffee,"Lucky you, I think the Braun 600 is out of stock. It true, this coffee pot makes warm coffee. I have boiled water for the carafe, poured it in, let it sit 3min. Nope, still warm not hot coffee. I plan on returning it but, have no idea what will be better. I really think manufactures have made them like this to avoid complaints if scalding coffee?"
5,Thermal coffeemaker,"This is a great product and a great price. No problems with this machine. Has just basic features but looks good and coffee tastes great. Just be sure to preheat carafe with hot water, coffee stays warm for at least 3 hrs."
5,Good Enough For A Coffee Fanatic,I roast my own beans and use a high-end burr grinder to grind them minutes before brewing. I'm serious about my coffee and this Braun is up to the job. It consistently produces a great cup of coffee and looks sleek and elegant while doing it. I'm delighted with it.
3,Was Great At First...Then...,"This coffeemaker was great for the first month or so, but then...it is impossible to clean well inside the small opening of the carafe - and eventually the coffee develops a muddy flavor. There is build up from the coffee oils that line the inside of the carafe. I have tried many things to try to clean this, but have not been successful. Although at first I loved that the thermal carafe kept the coffee warm...it also now makes it warm and muddy...so the longer one keeps the coffee in the carafe, the muddier it gets. I am going to go back to the glass carafe model of this coffeemaker. I like the features of the machine, but hate the fact that the carafe can't be cleaned well. Glass is much easier to clean out for a fresh coffee taste."
4,Braun Impressions coffemaker,"Makes a good cup of coffee with the water filter in it. It was suppose to brew at a higher temperature according to GMA, but I don't see a difference. I don't like the cone shaped basket."
2,Not as good as my old Mr. Coffee Thermal,"I ordered this item because I was growing very tired of ""fighting"" with the lid on the Mr. Coffee thermal carafe. (It's a threaded lid, and unless the lid is exactly perfect, there can be a big mess to clean up in the morning!).After two weeks of using this Braun, I am back to using the Mr. Coffee because the Braun's thermal carafe DOES NOT keep the coffee hot beyond a couple of hours.I am very disappointed in this product."
5,Thermal Coffemaker,"We have had one of these at a vacation home for 2+ years and recently bought a second on for our main home. I make the coffee early in the morning and preheat the thermal pot with water from the hot water tap. It is still very hot when my wife has a cup an hour or two later. It is easy to use and makes good coffee. We don't use the water filter. If either one ever breaks, we will buy another."
5,MLP,"Great coffee maker, I love the internal water filter, Auto shut-offfeature nice too, Insulated thermal carafe keeps coffee hot, Savingmoney by skipping the Starbucks every morning"
3,Soso coffeemaker,"Though this coffeemaker does produce the quality coffee I expected, its stainless steel carafe does not keep it properely hot for more than an hour at the best. Even after pre-heating the carafe, I find it does not hold its heat very long. If you expect hot coffee for more than an hour, don't get this product."
3,"Brews weak-ish, and you must brew a full 10 cups!","Do you drink exactly 10 cups of coffee at each sitting? If so, this Braun could be a decent choice. The thermal carafe is a good alternative to the standard glass-on-a-hotpad which will cook your coffee to sludge as you sip your way through a few cups. It's easy to use and clean and relatively drip-free. That's the good news. But if, like my husband and me, you often want just half a pot, look elsewhere.We bought this Braun to replace our broken Capresso Elegance Grande (a slightly cheaper machine about 4-5 years old). We failed to notice that the Braun has no aroma/small pot setting, and boy can you ever tell. If you brew just half a pot your expensive beans will produce a super-weak, tepid cup reminiscent of a fast-food joint. Really really bad. And even at full capacity the Braun requires more coffee than I'm used to for the same strength, which could add up to quite an expense over time. I suspect it just doesn't heat the water hot enough."
2,Not so impressed,"Well, it doesn't keep the coffee warm for very long at all. The switch turns off and there is no warming plate under the thermos. Less than an hour after making the coffee and it is nothing but lukewarm. If you add some cream, it's no good at all.I'm also miffed that just after I bought it, Amazon lowered the price. Did they do that because it doesn't work very well?"
1,braun thermal coffee maker,"I have preferred Braun products over all others. Bought my dad one of these for Christmas, he used it for maybe two weeks and now it doesn't work. Does anyone have any experience with Braun replacement?"
1,Disappointed,The idea of a thermal carafe sounded good. This one is very attractive. I didn't realize there was no way to reheat the coffee. I preheated the carafe with hot water before brewing but it failed to keep the coffee warm thru the second cup. As a result I was constantly pouring out pots of luke warm coffee.I replaced it with a Keurig B70 single cup brewer. Although the pod to make a cup of coffee is still priced ridiclously high it is worth it. Every cup is fresh and hot. Each person can select their brand of coffee and there is no clean up or waste.
5,Better than expected!!!,"I've had this coffee maker now for a month and a half and I love it!I decided to buy the #4 cone filters since the washable gold filter allows some grounds to get in the brewed coffee. With the paper filters, that isn't an issue.A brewed pot of coffee stays reasonably ""hot"" for about 4 hours which is much better than I expected.After having some family and friends over for dinner and making coffee, they were all very impressed as well. One of the best parts of having a thermal carafe is the ability to just leave it on the dinner table without a hot pad or anything."
4,Awesome Product,"This thing works exactly as advertised! Very good coffee maker for the price. We have had Braun Coffeee makers before, but the glass carafe frequently broke. The thermal carafe makes cleaning a snap and it keeps the beverage hot for upto 8 hours. Two points of caution:1. If you use RO or bottled water in your coffee maker, you will not notice a difference in taste with the water filter attached. You also may NOT need to change the Brita filter every 2 months as recommended. Save your money!2. We use a paper filter over the gold one that comes with the system. It extends the life of the filter and prevents fine grounds in your coffee."
4,Good purchase!,"We were looking for a quality coffee maker with a stainless steel carafe and are very pleased with this one! We had bad luck breaking our Krups glass carafe and we're tired of replacing it over and over again. The Braun KF600 Impressions has made great coffee. I think it is an excellent value for the price. We haven't had it long, but so far we're thinking this coffeemaker will hold up for many years. Wish it had a programmable timer, but oh well, we can live without it."
5,OVERALL WINNER,"I do like this coffeemaker. It's streamlined design is efficient: takes up just the right amount of counter space and is not too tall. The pot is stylish and once you learn how to detach the lid and the coffee basket, use is a no-brainer. The coffee does stay hot in the thermal carafe and it's attractive design makes it table appropriate. The gold filter is great and the machine will pay for itself over time because you do not have to buy paper filters."
2,Great looking in the ad... NOT hot enough!,I bought this and operated it for 2 weeks - then contacted the shipper Etronics and asked to send it back! 1.) I never received the gold tint coffee cone inside. 2.) No owners manual - not that it really is necessary? - this is coffe not rocket science right? 3.)The final kicker is that the coffee never brewed quite hot enough. Hot enough to enjoy a bit - but the temp was as though it has been sitting in the thermos for about 4-5 hours... not as though it was fresh brewed!Sent it back and got a full refund on both the item and shipping!Etronics is worthy of using for purchasing and shipping... and Amazon is Amazoning! (play on Amazing!)Tom M.
5,Easy & Delicious,"I love this product. Whether I make two cups or 10 cups, it is always delicious. I would recommend this to anyone. It's definitely a keeper!"
5,I like it.,"Very pleased with the purchase of this coffeemaker. I upgraded from another Braun model for the thermal carafe. It's quick, makes great coffee and the automatic shut off is a super feature. My only complaint, and this applys to ALL coffeemakers, is their idea of what size a cup of coffee is? 10 cups equal just over 4 in my house! Being able to 'steal' that first cup is another feature that I take advantage of. This coffeemaker will do you well and Impressions is a great name for the model."
4,Good Coffee!,"I was attracted to this coffeemaker after having seen it in Bloomingdale's. It has a small foot print, is very attractive, and does not have all the extras that I never use--no clock, no 4-cup brew option, no cleaning reminder. I replaced a thermal Kitchen Aid which never brewed hot coffee and therefore, never released all the goodness of the beans. This Braun makes absolutely wonderful coffee. I preheat the thermal pot with hot water, while preparing the brew basket, and it stays hot throughout my morning paper and breakfast. If you want a basic, attractive, coffeemaker without all the ""stuff"" you will love this one."
2,Bouquet of Bad Ideas,"When my last, beloved, Braun coffee maker died, I knew I was in trouble. None of the new possibilities seemed to have what I wanted - 12 cup capacity - buzzer to alert one when coffee was brewed - nothing fancy - we drink a lot of coffee but only brew what we will use immediately. We are coffee fanatics.The Braun KF 600 thermal carafe is too heavy, considering you have to pour while standing on your head to see how many cups of water you have dispensed into the well. I have NO idea when the brewing is completed, having no visual or audible clue. It's overhanging lip means there is always coffee left in the pot and it is difficult to fit in a dishwasher. Mea culpa. No excuses. I shall cope for a few months and change brands. Too bad."
1,***Warning do not buy this***,THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND TOTALY JUNK1. lasted only 4 months before it died2. never kept the coffe hot3. The filter basket broke soon afeter I bought it had to use tape to keep it closed. to replace the broekn basket will cost like 22 + shipping what a rip off.4. the pot is very hard to clean5. 10 cups? 10 cups of water should make like 5 cups of coffee not with this junk it made like 3 and 1/2 cupsI will never buy another braun coffee maker ever again
1,Disappointing. Coffee is COLD,"COLD coffee is what you get with this piece of junk. I am very Disappointed. I wish I had not bought it. I wasted $ 80.00 buying this. The biggest problem is COLD coffee. This coffeemaker does NOT have a warming plate, so the coffee will NOT stay hot. It DOES give you good tasting HOT coffee for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the coffee is NOT hot.Yes, I DID try pre-heating the pot with nearly boiling water for 10 mins.before making the coffee. This causes you to have hot coffee for about 35 minutes, after that the coffee has cooled off so much you CANNOT drink it. THEN you start running to and from a microwave oven trying to heat up the cooled coffee. I am very disappointed that there is not a ""warming plate"" that remains on so that the coffee will remain hot. I have gone back to using my 20 year old Mr. Coffee."
2,Beware...... not 10 cups,I purchased this coffeemaker because it was rated as making the best cup of coffee by a popular morning TV show. It does make a good cup of coffee............BUT.....it isn't a 10 cup coffeemaker. I was making coffee too often. I finally filled a large measuring cup and discovered that the Braun 10 cup coffeemaker is actually a 5+ cup coffeemaker.
1,Best Iced Coffee Maker Out There!,"Sure, this product is was on the eyes, but God help you if you want a hot cup of coffee! The first cup will be nice and hot, the second cup will be luke warm...the third cup may as well be iced coffee. I mean come on. I kept looking in the directions to see if there was a way to keep the lousy pot hot. All it is says is, for best results fill pot with hot water first. That's all I need, an extra step and a waste of water. And to top it all off, the pot isn't even dishwasher safe. I've got to find a nice old fashioned glass carafe coffee maker, and soon. The kind that keeps the coffee warm from 1st cup to last. This thing stinks"
1,Didn't like this coffee maker,"It was a nice looking coffee maker, but the performance was extremely poor. Sometimes the coffee would be luke warm in the carafe, sometimes it would overflow when brewing and everytime there was a residue at the bottom of the pot. Also, there was no auto-brew feature so you could have it brew for you in the morning.Not a recommended purchase, especially for the price. I returned this purchase and bought a tried-and-true Mr. Coffee for much less..."
3,poor basket design,I have had the Braun kf 600 for about 6 months and it makespretty good coffee but for one problem: the basket has a tendancyto swing open during the brewing cycle. The pushbutton basket release and the spring loaded basket is really overkill and notat all neccessary for convenience. I have spoken with braunabout the design and they have agreed to replace the machine.This is a classic case of not sticking to the traditional manualbasket operation for a sales gimmic that has no added value.
1,Poor product,"After reading several consumer reviews, we chose this coffee maker to replace our Cuisinart. We were disappointed that the Cuisinart had lasted only three years. At least it lasted more than three days! Unfortunately, the original packaging was inadvertently thrown away or we would have returned this product immediately. The automatic shut-off feature only worked for two days, we absolutely have to use paper filters along with the gold basket filter to get decent coffee (we never needed to with the Cuisinart) and for some reason this coffee maker has decided to drip long after it is finished brewing. This machine is a disaster; the basket popped open this morning while it was brewing, sending coffee all over the counter! We will be buying a Cuisinart this week to replace the Braun, even though we will never get our money back for this poor product."
4,good coffeemaker,"I am pleased with this coffeemaker. It's quick, the coffee stays hot and it's easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it could be set up better in that you need to get at the right side to put in the coffee and then need to turn it to the left to see the water gauge when filling. It would be so much easier to have them both on the same side as far as where it sits on your counter. But if you want a no frills coffeemaker, it's pretty good."
5,Best Coffee Maker,"I've gone through many coffeemakers in my day and suffered through those that were inconvenient and hard to clean, but this Braun KF600 is the best I've ever used. It appears to be of a higher quality than the others: the filter basket snaps securely in to place and their is no leakage. The carafe is excellent and the water pours in an even stream without splashing or leaking out over the side. The coffee brews more quicky than with others that I've used and the built in water filter is an added bonus. The insulated carafe keeps the coffee hot for a couple of hours. This coffeemaker comes with a gold filter but paper filters can also be used. I don't think I've ever been so happy with an appliance!!"
4,Great coffee maker,"This is a great coffe maker...it makes good coffee fast and keeps it warm...the only thing I wish it had is a timer, but I knew it didn't have one when i bought it. Very sleek and modern looking, matches my stainless appliances great."
4,"Braun KF600, 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Brushed Stainless Steel","Pro's:Excellent design, functionality and ease of maintenance.Makes a great pot of coffee that stays fresh for hours.Con's:Only that Braun should offer a 12-cup version."
3,"Sexy., Tasty, Messy, & Warm","This is very attractive coffee pot and goes well in a stainless kitchen. It makes very good coffee but more grinds pass through the gold filter than desired. The gold filter is messy to clean as well. Paper works better. With the thermal pot you don't get that burnt taste like traditional coffee pots. But if you like really hot coffee this may not be for you. The first cup is perfect but the coffee turns to luke warm afer 30 minutes. I wind up turning on the burner 2 or 3 times. I tried pre-warming the pot with hot water,per other reviewers, but that doesn't work."
4,Gets the job done,"We are not coffee snobs in our house, but we do hate the minor irritations of cheap coffee makers. This one is worth a few extra $$ because it has some nice ""extras."" The basket flips out at the touch of a button, which is nice because I hate fighting with baskets that are difficult to jiggle off. The top of the thermal carafe keeps the coffee INSIDE the pot and doesn't drip all over the counter. And of course, the stainless steel finish looks cooler than regular plastic.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I can't stand the filter that comes with the pot. I have never had luck with goldtone or steel filters - they always leave a layer of sediment at the bottom of the pot, so the person who drinks the last cup is treated to a cup of mud. This happens no matter how coarsely we grind the coffee."
2,Does not keep coffee hot,"I bought this carafe style coffee maker because I thought it would better suite my habit of drinking 2-4 cups over a 3-4 hour period. Initially the coffe is about 150-160 degrees. Within 60 minutes it is about 120 degrees. The warming burner kicks off 17 minutes after the brew cycle is started. I have found that turning the burner back on does little to keep the coffee warm. You can, literally, place your hand on the burner while it is on and not get a burn. If you are just after that first cup of coffee this may be a good buy. I would assume this is not the case if you are looking for a carafe style maker."
4,Instant Coffee !!!,"I've been using this coffee maker for about 2 weeks. It brews the coffee better than many products out there. Stainless steel finish looks really good.Pros: The replacable filter in the machine makes the coffee taste better to compared to other products.Cons: It doesn't keep the coffee warm for long time. Automatically turns off in about 15 minutes. So if you're planning on having ""hot"" coffee for about 1-2 hours you're better off with some other brand."
2,Disappointed,"Appearance of black plastic looks cheap compared to my Cusinart, and the carafe does not keep the coffee hot for very long. We kept it as a back-up (because what are you going to do once you use it!) - but we have gone back to another Cusinart, which we love!"
5,The coffemaker works,The Braun KF600 work fine as expected. I can get warm coffee after one hour from the thermal pod. It works for me perfectly.
3,Weak Coffee,"I like everything about this coffeemaker (thermal warmth, looks, easy to use) except I think the coffee grounds capacity is too small for the volume. I cannot get this machine to make an adequitely strong coffee no matter how much coffee I use. Otherwise great, but if you like strong coffee you might want to think twice about this unit."
1,LASTED 2.5 MONTHS,I had high hopes for this coffee maker. but the basket started not closing well after one month and we had to gently hold it for the water to filter down. This morning it began springing open a spraying hot water all over. After an hour of working on it we realize the catch is not working and the basked no longer closes. So it lasted a grand total Christmas morning to Feb. 12th. Nice. . .
5,Braun KF 600 Review,"First saw the item on Good Morning America in which it was rated the top coffee maker. So far, no complaints. Makes a great cup of coffee."
2,A luke warm product!!,"If you like a ""hot"" cup of coffee please don't buy this coffee maker. It comes out luke warm at the best. Don't let the stainless steel carafe fool you, it has nothing to do with keeping the coffee hot. I'm already looking at other coffee makers. I've had this Braun for about a year and my patience has worn out. Its days are numbered!!!"
1,Braun KF600 Impression,"I am extremely unhappy with this product for the following reasons:1. The coffee is not hot enough and must be microwaved immediately after brewing,2. If one fills the reservoir to the full 10 cup limit, the carafe overflows when brewing,3. When pouring coffee, I must put cups in the sink as the carafe drips. When coffee in the thermal carafe is nearing the bottom, I must remove the lid to complete pouring."
3,used to have a senseo machine...,"We ""downgraded"" to this machine from a Senseo, the pods got too expensive. We like it, it's really easy to use and clean. The coffee stays hot for a few hours and warm until early evening. We started using disposible filters because the reusable filter lets some of the grounds through. All in all it is a good machine and it looks nice."
4,A fairly good coffeemaker,"The only disappointment I have with this coffeemaker is that the coffee is not quite hot enough. Preheating the caraffe with hot water is almost enough, but I still microwave each cup for 15 to 20 seconds before drinking it. It's not that the coffee is tepid, just not sufficiently hot."
1,Run away- Run away from this coffee maker,"I spent twice as much for this coffee maker as any in the past. In my new home it was going to look impressive sitting on the counter. The handsome stainless steel carafe and the black machine would match well with my other appliances and utensils. However, there was one major problem. IT DID NOT MAKE HOT COFFEE. I tried to preheat the carafe but who wants to do that at 5:00 AM? I then resorted to microwaving the coffee for an additional 30 seconds. After getting tired of this, I went back to my $25 Mr. Coffee maker which had been retired to camping trips.After a couple months, I decided to try it again. I quickly remembered that it not only made luke-warm coffee but I also tended to spill with it quite often. After another week, I tossed it. Didn't even think about giving it to a friend."
2,WARNING - BURN HAZARD!,"WARNING - BURN HAZARD! The carafe does not hold 10 cups, even though it is sold as a 10 cup maker. So if you fill the reservior to the ""10"" mark, the hot coffee just overflows all over the place. What I also found especially fun was that even if you don't fill it 10 but say to 9, you have to be very careful when picking up the carafe or hot coffee dribbles out of the undersized carafe (leaving me with wonderful burns all over my: hand, wrist and forearm). I am really surprised that this thing has not been pulled off the market due to liability. At the very least they should warn the user that the carafe is really only safe to hold about only 8 cups."
1,Braun KF600 Impressions /Absolutely hate it!,"I spent a week going over reviews and searching for the right coffee maker. I did pick this, and several reason's it's going back! VERY small, did I say ,small, pot, it will make about 2 if your lucky 3 large coffee mugs of coffee. The water indicator was on the left, and you pour the coffee in the right side! I used my old crafe to put 10 cups of water into this and it was all the way to 12 cups on this one and I still had water left in my crafe! I then brewed a pot with the amount of water I put in the resivore, and when I went to pour a cup, I had coffee all over the counter and floor, the resivore took more water then the crafe!!!! The crafe lid is EXTREMELY small and next to impossible to get off.I think I am headed to a Cuisinart! Good Luck!"
1,This is not a 10 Cup coffee Maker,"Braun claims this is a 10 cup coffer maker. It is is not. It holds only a little more than 40 oz. In the user manual, Braun clarifies its claim by saying that it holds 10 4.4 oz cups. So, if you are looking for a 10 cup coffer maker, make sure you get one that holds at least 60 oz, our you will be disappointed. This is a case where you are better served by actually going to the store and checking out the different coffee makers because there is a wide range of definitions of 'cup'."
5,GREAT Coffee Pot,"I love this pot, what more can I say? It is the easiest pot to clean that I have owned and the thermal pot keeps the coffee hot!"
3,Coffee system problems,I purchased this product 6 weeks ago and just recently took it out of the box and used it. The pause and serve feature doesn't work. I can't return it to Amazon because it is over 30 days. I guess I'm try Braun to get satisfaction.
4,Braun KF600 10 cup,This is a great coffee pot but I wish it had a timer. We used to set the timer and wake up to coffee. This pot is so fast it really isn't an issue though. We could have used a 12 cup. Serveral mornings I have made an additional cup of coffee.
3,A NOT SO HOT POT,"The pot produces a decent cup of coffee, however the thermal pot does not keep the coffee hot for second and third cups. We have had to use a microwave to reheat the coffee even after only a short amount of time has elapsed."
4,A very nice coffee maker if you don't need all the gadgets,"I bought this coffee to replace a Hamilton Beach model that died after only 2 years of service. In the 6 months that I've been using it the Braun KF600 has server me very well. It is of solid construction, looks great and is easy to clean. It has a built-in (Non-proprietary Brita water filter) and makes a good and consisent cup of coffee. It doesn't have the clock or auto-timer but that isn't an issue for me since I like my coffee as fresh as possible (ie. not made with coffee grounds that sat out all night)."
4,works great,"I'm very happy with this. I wanted a thermal coffeemaker that wasn't huge and got it. And the price on amazon was significantly less than in stores. The only trouble is how easily you end up with smudges on the metal finish. While it's sleek, it's also harder to clean."
4,Good coffee maker,"I'm glad I bought this Braun coffeemaker with the thermal carafe. The coffee is the best I've had for a long time, and if pre-heated the carafe keeps it warm for a few hours. The one draw-back is the size of the carafe and the amount of coffee it makes. I'd prefer a larger pot - at least 12 to 14 cups. It amazes me that the manufacturing community thinks a cup is 4 or 5 ounces. What nonsense!I have had two overflows, both of which were operator error. The first, I filled the tank from measuring cups and not from the carafe. You have to be careful about that, as the marking for 10 on my tank is higher than if I fill the carafe to the top. When I did that, I had about a cup overflow. The second time, I didn't position the carafe properly, and again - overflow.Aside from the size of the carafe, though, I am very happy with this Braun. It is the first Braun I have purchased, and if this is indicative of their quality, I'm likely to buy another Braun product in the future."
4,Very good coffee maker; would buy again,"Pros:Makes good tasting coffeeAttractiveNot too bigRelatively speedy in making coffeeCons:Doesn't keep coffee hot enough long enough for my tastesBottom line:Coffee plenty big for a 2-3 drinkers and a squeeze for a large party. But room is at a premium on our counters so this one works well. If the carafe can hold the heat longer, this would be a 5-star unit. I would buy again."
4,8 oz cup vs 4.5 oz cup,"We have this same machine at my office and I was impressed that the coffee stays warm for 2 hours after brewing. I bought one for my home and I noticed one very important thing - the ""10 cup"" statements are based on 4.5 oz per cup NOT the standard 8 oz cup measurement. So, in reality, you will get just over 5 cups of coffee with one pot.WARNING! The thermos only holds 42 oz of water which means that when you fill the water tank prior to brewing, you cannot fill the tank to the plastic ""10"" line. This is almost 45 oz of water and the thermos will overflow. I tested it out twice and found that 42 oz is the maximum (on the water tank, this is the between the numbers ""8"" and ""9"").I am really happy with the taste and temperature of the coffee but disappointed that this coffeemaker makes less coffee than my last machine."
1,Terrible customer service at P&G/Braun,"I was very pleased with this coffeemaker for the first two months. Unfortunately, the carafe fell on the floor shortly thereafter and the handle broke off. I called P&G at 1-800-BRAUN-11 and originally was told that a replacement carafe would be shipped to me free of charge. Several weeks later, I received a letter stating that I'd need to order a carafe on my own since it was not, in fact, covered under warranty. I did so through a third party in March. It is now August and the product is still on back order. I canceled the order and called P&G again to find out if there is another way to get a carafe short of buying an entirely new coffeemaker. I was told that Braun is no longer distributing in the U.S. but I could order a carafe through a ""foreign company."" She also directed me to E-bay! I will never buy another Braun product because of their poor customer service."
2,Braun KF600,"I felt this unit made a good cup of coffee and is very nice looking. However,the measure of 10cups is overstated, my current ""8"" cup coffee maker brews the same amount of coffee, if not a little more. For seventy dollars I feel it should include a timer. Also, the unit doesn't come with a pitcher for filling the reservoir. I can only assume that the coffee pot should be used, which make for a slow cumbersome fill."
2,braun review,"I was expecting a great coffee machine with thermos after reading the reviews. I am a little sorry I got rid of my Melitta coffee machine. The coffee just isn't hot enough. It is nice to look at, but I'd rather have hot coffee."
2,Great Coffee Maker if you don't like your coffee HOT!,"I've had this coffee maker for 2 years now, and not once has it brewed a HOT cup of coffee. It comes out luke warm and if you add cream it's even colder. The carafe adds no value regarding the temperature. I like the automatic shut off feature, however I don't like that it's preset on 17 minutes. I have kids and sometimes after brewing the coffee, I don't get to drink my 1st cup within 17 minutes. The gold built in filter lets way too many coffee grinds pass, so I would recommend a paper filter. Overall, not a good coffee maker!"
1,Two years and out,"worked OK for about two years, then heating element degraded, spring for release broke (pouring coffee all over when carafe removed).Not a good value."
2,Not so hot.,I like the appearance. My complaint is that I heat the carafe with hot water before brewing but the coffee does not start out very hot and since there is no warming plate I find myself microwaving my coffee a lot. I also found that the basket overflows if I try to use the pause-and-serve feature.
2,"Good coffee, doesn't stay as hot as claimed","This unit is as simple as the $19.99 Braun and the coffee is no better. Good coffee but the SS caraffe does not keep it as hot as claimed. Essently within an hour of making and drinking individual cups of coffee, the last is cold. I might keep it because I have broken to many of the glass units and there dosen't appear to be much better product on Amazon."
3,10 cups? Really?,"This ""10 cup"" coffee maker makes about 20% less coffee than my old 10 cup machine. The look and function this coffee maker is very good, however"
2,Should be equipped with built-in microwave,"Nice-looking machine, makes good coffee, but carafe (even when used according to instructions) fails to keep the coffee hot, which is a major flaw. Why else by a carafe coffee-maker?"
2,Cold Coffee,"I purchased this coffeemaker so I could eliminate my coffee carafe and free-up some counter space. Turns out the glass-lined carafe keeps my coffee hotter much longer than the dual stainless steel walls of this unit. So now I still use the old carafe AND have a coffeemaker that only brews 10 cups. I should have kept my old 12-cup Mr. Coffee coffeemaker.On the positive side, the unit is attractive, well made and the coffee pours in my cup, not all over the counter.If you drink all your coffee within an hour or two of brewing, this unit is a good choice. Otherwise, purchase a cheaper unit, and spend the rest on a quality carafe."
2,"All Braun, no brain","Made a tasty cup of coffee. However, it did not stay hot very long, and when making the 10 cups, 1 cup ended up on the countertop, even tho I measured carefully according to instructions. Maybe it was a lemon - returned to manufacturer for refund."
1,Kojirushi Thermal Coffeemaker is Better and Half The Price,"I have the Braun KF 600 and it stopped working after a few months so I purchased the Zojirushi and was pleasantly surprised. The Zojurishi brews a better, faster pot of coffee and keeps it hotter in the thermal carafe much longer than the Braun. It is also half the price of the Braun. It is rare that you find find a better product at a lower price, but the Zojirushi fits the bill. I am pretty picky about my coffee maker and I am very impressed by this product."
1,NOT Worth it!,I would have given this item a -5 stars if i could have. The filter basket is a nightmare to remove. It is so poorly designed it will break off before it comes loose. The instructions are proably easier to read in the foreign languges then the english version.
1,Carafe does not hold 10 cups,"I did not purchase this coffee maker here at Amazon. I purchased it elsewhere for less money. I have read the reviews and notice that no one has noticed that the carafe does not hold l0-cups of coffee. It barely holds 7 cups. I was very disappointed in this and have written Braun and waiting for a reply. It does make good coffee, not hot enough for my taste. The construction could be better for the price."
2,not great,"The coffee was never hot enough, even though I followed directions here to warm up the caraffe. I just returned it."
1,"Breaks Easily, buy something else","I bought two of the Braun KF600 coffee makers. The first one I got a Williams Sonoma near my place. When I got home and unpacked it, the top was broken although the package was not damaged and had never been opened. I checked Amazon and found the same coffee maker for a lower price, so I returned the one to the store and ordered it online.The second one worked for less than a week, but unfortunately, I had thrown away the box, etc. and figured it wasn't worth bothering with for such a small amount of money. So, this is obviously a poor quality product not worthy of purchasing. I since bought the Zojirushi carafe coffee maker and IT BLOWS AWAY THE BRAUN!!! It may cost a few bucks more, but you get what you pay for.hd"
5,Super coffee & super service!!!,"This coffeemaker works perfectly with 1/2 cup ground beans and keeps it plenty hot for as long as needed. It was a gift for my mom and she is thrilled after years of poor-tasting coffee that gets cold in minutes. I should mention that my mom has the nickname ""asbestos mouth"" and so if she says the coffee stays hot then you can believe her! She received this within a few days of ordering which was ahead of the projected date. All around a great product and great service!"
4,Braun KF600 10-cup thermal coffeemaker,"Owned for three trouble-free months. Unit is simple and well-made. No extras (like clock or auto-start features), but should continue to be trouble-free. Unit is fast and consistent. Coffee is right temperature and is efficient in extraction. Downside is the hassle of using special filters at a cost of abt $6 every 3 months or so. Skip the filters if your water is soft. The upside is that using the filters could avoid the hassle of cleaning/decalcifying the unit every 2-3 months. Overpriced compared to other units, but the Brand has a good record for reliability."
4,Good coffee maker,"I am happy with this coffee maker. It keeps the coffee warm, although we do not usually let it sit around long in the pot; it is good looking; easy to use; and so far most of our pots taste good unless we added too little or too many beans. My only complaints are that it doesn't offer a timer feature and that the door to the basket seems like it might be problematic over time. Overall a good coffee maker for the price and no more burnt coffee taste or the worry that I left the coffee burner on!"
4,Pretty But Frail,"This coffee maker is chock full of simplifying features; built in water filter, push button flip out basket and an automatic shut off to name a few. The achilles heel is that the assembly on the bottom of the basket is just looking for a fast break on a hard kitchen floor. I know, I'm on my second one. Call me a glutton for punishment, but I do like its ease of use and would never buy any coffee maker without a thermal carafe. It fresh tasting coffee three hours later as opposed to bitter coffee in the same time period. Just beef it up a little for us ""just woke up with no coffee yet"" clumsy zombies."
3,Bitter Coffee,If you are a coffeee counnoisseur you will want to purchase a maker with a glass inside for better taste. This is a good maker but with the stainless inside this makes the coffee bitter. We have swithched to our old coffee maker untill we can find another.
5,Keeps it fresh and hot for hours,"I did my research, on the product I wanted, and I was not dissappointed. Plus very reasonable price, thank you"
3,Mixed feelings,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this coffeemaker, and I agree with most:1- The Braun makes delicious coffee. I am delighted with the taste -- it's rich, fragrant, and pure.2 - The thermal coffeepot does NOT keep coffee hot. I wish there were a way to adjust it somehow.3 - The cups are smaller than most, but that does not bother me, since I never make a full pot. I have adjusted accordingly.Basically, if you are buying for great coffee, I highly recommend the Braun. If you are buying for heat and longevity, this is not the pot for you."
5,If you REALLY like coffee,"This coffee maker is perfect for the connoisseur! There is no burner, so your coffee stays the perfect temp. If you're going to be drinking it over the course of several hours, I'd recommend filling the carafe with warm water for a few minutes prior to brewing to ensure 4 hours later you still have hot coffee. Slow perk, is just the right amount of time to get the perfect cup - no waiting for 15 minutes, but not so quick it doesn't have time to filter through those luscious fresh ground beans!"
5,A great coffee maker really does make a difference,"After breaking lots of glass carafes, and suffering through other coffee making machines that somehow left the flavor out, this one was a huge improvement. The fit and finish are excellent, and the coffee tastes so good that we are no longer tempted to go to the coffee shop just to get a decent cup of coffee. It really does stay warm quite a few hours, too; the thermal carafe is top notch. It took a couple of decades to find a good machine at a reasonable price, but this one is definitely it."
3,warm coffee,"The coffee is just not hot enough. Even with warming the pot before starting to brew, it doesn't seem to help. I have to say I am disappointed. I think it should be hotter. Not worth the money or the wait."
2,Stops and starts,"It worked great for about a month and now it will stop brewing halfway through a cycle. I have to move the pot around or turn it on and off to get it to finish. It is a nice looking unit and keeps the coffee warm without burning. I get about 3 good size cups of coffee out of a full pot, so I don't know how they rate it as a 10 cup unit."
3,"Great coffee, poor quality",This is not a cheap coffee maker. Makes great coffee and since there is no warmer plate coffee stays fresh. But today after only 2 years it quit working unexpectedly. After looking at the reviews of other Braun coffee makers this is common. Made in the Czech Republic. I suppose quality is not part of the job there. My Mr. Coffee maker that has been around for 10 years still works great.Recommend only if you want good coffee but don't care if the coffee pot has a short lifespan.
4,Good product,I have had my Braun KF600 for about a month and it is working fine. I like the look and it brews coffee nice and hot. It would be nice if it had a feature to let you know when brewing is done.
5,"Hot, Fresh, Flavoured coffee! The Best!","Highly recommend this model coffee machine. The coffee tastes fresh, hot and flavourful. It is important to heat up the carafe first with hot water. I boil my kettle and fill the carafe for about 2 minutes. I grind the beans to a courser setting when using the gold filter. This avoids the fine grinds from seeping through. It drips the water through at a more relaxed speed which gives the coffee more flavor. Stainless steel carafe keeps the coffee hot for a good hour and warm for around 2 hours.It is the best maker I've owned."
3,An OK Coffeemaker,"Braun is a good brand and this one is not my first. I like this coffeemaker but I like my coffee hot. The quality of the coffee is good. Rinse the carafewith hot water before brewing will keep the coffee warmer.Louise Tomberlin,Asheville,NC,USA"
4,Good Coffee,"This product was rated on one of the AM news programs as on of the best coffee makers, making the best cup of coffee. It was said to cook the coffee at the correct temperature and keep the coffee hot for a long time. I don't think the coffee get very hot but it does keep it hot. Much better coffee maker than your average $30-40 drip maker."
4,The Coffee's great! but . . .,"I am pleased with the taste of the coffee, it's a nice rich brew. The unit is solid and well made. The down-side is the coffee isn't hot enough for me, it requires a little nuking."
3,Great tasting coffee... for a short while,"Good coffee is an important part of my morning routine and the Braun Impressions made a tasty cup. I also liked the fact that it had a thermal carafe. It kept the coffee hot for 4-5 hours without the burnt taste of a hot plate.Now the bad news... After a year of use, it started leaking from underneath the base. For $80, this coffee maker should have lasted longer."
3,caraf is way too small,"Braun 's cups are smaller beware !! That is my only complaint.The coffee tastes good, it really depends on the coffee used.The brewing is very quick and hot.I like this machine but the caraf is too small for us. It is advertised as a 10 cup coffee maker NO WAY ! it should say 8 cup . When I tried to fill it to the top of the caraf it over flowed on the counter, my fault to over fill it ,I tried to make it something that it is not .I guess I wish I'd bought a conventional 10 - 12 cup machine. As on the weekends i have to make 2 pots to get that extra cup or 2 .I'd love the machine if only the capacity was larger ."
1,Perhaps I got a lemon...,"I purchased this coffee maker about 6 months ago based on all the glowing reports I read here. Worst coffee maker I've ever had! My carafe hardly keeps the coffee warm (not hot) for an hour -- and I leave hot water in it for at lease 5 minutes. After the first cup I have to nuke it. The carafe is difficult to clean. I can't get my hand in with a sponge, nor can I get a brush up around the underside of the top. It makes good tasting coffee, but I like mine hot, not reheated. Today I decided to give up and get myself a Mr. Coffee.A fifty year connoisseur coffee drinker who grinds her beans, mixes types, and loves her morning coffee."
4,Above average coffee maker,"After buying and returning a number of high end (Delongi, etc.) coffee makers, I finally found one that didn't give the coffee a ""plastically"" taste. I bought this machine eight months ago and it continues to make good coffee. Nevertheless, although I change the water filter at the recommended intervals, it does seem to take longer for the coffee to be done. Also, the thermal carafe doesn't seem to keep the coffee as hot for as long as other carafes I've owned."
3,O.K.,This c.d. was alright. The thing I didn't like about it was that every song was that same old punk/acdc upbeat rock tune. Some were catchy but variation would have been nice. Lack of guitar solo's hurt as well. If you like to just rock out constantly this might work for you. If you want some dynamic interesting music your in the wrong place.
4,"Good collection, but doesn't measure up to another","Hiromi keeps getting better with her live shows all the time, and her music overall is good. This CD is a good listen, with no real highlights, but I didn't like it as much as her second CD, ""Brain"". Whereas I could really enjoy ""Brain"" when I would listen to it, this one doesn't have me wanting to put it in the player again quite as quickly."
4,Phenomenal musicianship!,"Hiromi Uehara is my new favorite jazz keyboardist/pianist, a spot held by Chick Corea for 26 or so years in my heart. She's JUST AMAZING! not only the fastest piano playing I've ever heard, bar none, but she's got SUCH amazing feel and songwriting, she's just unbelievable (you must check out her earlier works: Brain and Spiral). Her bass player and drummer and fantastic, as always. I didn't much care for the goobley goo sound of whoever that is on the fretless electric guitar. Sounds too cartooney for me compared the tightness and precision that pervades ALL of her other stuff. (hence a 4 not 5 stars) But hey, it's jazz. You're allowed to experiment. (I'm a HUGE fan of people like Allan Holdsworth and Yngwie Malsteen, so slop on a guitar is not something I can really listen to for long, LOL.. sorry) I highly recommend not only ""Time Control"" but all of the albums of Hiromi, I think she is utterly fantastic!"
5,Perfect and evenly toasted!,"I have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually haven't gotten another for the past 6 years. I've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase. Finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster. It's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting. Worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but I'm sure Braun is cringing if they read this! I love the little pull out tray, you don't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death! The toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time. Slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem. It is fast too, so you won't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster. I think you will be pleased with this great toaster, I am!"
5,May well be the ultimate in 'how-to' books.,"Out of a cosmology that has endured centuries of human culture and experience, Valerie Wells makes a clear case for personal empowerment in what may well be the ultimate in 'how-to' books. This is a fun and stimulating tutorial on how to get the most out of the way the universe is arranged. It is an exercise and experience guide to the appropriate acquisition and application of power. Some Native traditionals I know would call this making good medicine."
1,Crap,"I bought this about 15 years ago to crimp coaxil cable for my TVs and I still use it today. Now, with the internet, I am looking for the right tool. Yes, this does the job, it is inexpensive and basically, you get what you pay for. If you crimp the cap too tight, it cracks. If you don't crimp tight enough, you get a fuzzy picture. It doesn't stip or cut the cable and it doesn't give the professional fit you get from the cable companies, which is what I am looking for. My advice is to spend a little more money and get a coax cutter and compression crimper. That's what I'm looking for now."
3,Pretty to look at but poor sound quality,"I bought this for my 6 yr old to listen to music at bedtime. The sound quality is very cheap. CDs sound muffled and slower than originally intended. She uses the case to store her CDs and jewelry, but as a CD player, it is not the quality I would expect from Disney."
1,Terrible Quality,"Do not bother buying this. I made the mistake of purchasing this CD player and it broke after a few months. My daughter was upset about it, so I bought another one to replace it. Bad idea. It too broke after just two months. Is it just me or are the Disney items of very poor quality?"
2,A little disappointed...,"My daughter received this from her grandmother for her birthday, and it has never worked properly or consistently. It seems to have difficulty reading the CD's. My daughter (age 2.5) loves it, however, and doesn't seem to mind the poor sound quality and the difficulty we have getting it to work...she loves that it is pink and Disney princess!"
3,An okay entry,"My introduction to this author came from Shadow Fires. I really liked that book and was looking forward to this one. I wouldn't recommend this one (try the library or a friend or used first). It isn't bad, it just is incredibly annoying. Too many coincidences, to many people standing at just the right time to help. Also, The heroine is another whiny, annoying female. She wants freedom, but boo hoo I can't help anyone else. She just takes and takes and people cover up for her. If she wants to be free, then she needs to deal with the consquences of all her actions. True adults don't run from responsiblities. When she gets absolved of her guilt(another coincidence) she suddenly can grow up and take charge of her life. If you read this book look for Lani and Gunnar - their interaction is the only interesting part of this book."
5,Catherine Spangler does it again!,"In Shamara, Catherine Spangler takes her world of Controllers, Shadowers, and Shielders, and adds the very elusive Enhancers. This book was far better than I expected! I had thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in the series, and thought I knew what to expect when I bought this one. Catherine's style has hit its stride. In Shamara, she takes her craft to a whole new level. I can't wait to see what she does next!"
2,Two stars because I like the subplot,"Okay, I read the reviews here and was really excited to sit down and read the book. I love futuristics, they are probably my absolute favorite romances, except for dragon-involved ones. Three hours later I put it down, just managing to resist tossing it against a wall. I know that there are only so many plots to futuristic romances, but please! The characters were interesting, but the rest of the book was so predictable and seen-before. After I was done, I couldn't remember half the characters names, and I didn't care about them anyway! I gave this book two stars because there was an itsy bitsy subplot romance that I thought quite enjoyable. While at one point I would have considered buying the others in this series, I think I'm going to pass. If you like your ""usual"" futuristic romances from Lovespell, think about picking it up. If you go more toward Dara Joy, Sharon Lee or even Susan grant, I'd give it a pass. There are better ways to spend your money."
2,Not memorable,This book occurred a couple of years into the series so the characters were still being fleshed out so the focus was more on finding new missions to write about. While everything was traced back to Cardassian involvement showing the same narrow focus that the first few seasons did. Also the books needed to get broader in scope and characterization. This book was a slow start and the only part that was true to the series was the Quark and Odo conflict.
5,The Art of Sumi-e by Shozo Sato,This is a Great book and I received it in Great condition in a timely manner. This is the Best Book on Sumi-e I have ever seen.
3,It's just ok,This corner cutter is just ok. The corner cutters I've been getting at Staples make it far easier to always get a perfectly rounded corner. I was looking for larger and smaller cutters so I thought I'd try the EK Success products. I'm disappointing and won't buy from this manufacturer again.
3,"""Small"" but not small enough...","This item was satisfactory, although the punched-off area was not as small as I was hoping. I would've liked to have had some sort of standard measurement for the size of the rounded corner or the amount that would be punched off instead of the vague ""small"", ""medium"", and ""large"" descriptions of the various Ek Success punches offered. I spent a good deal of time just trying to guess how ""small"" the rounded corners this punch makes would be and, with no measurement whatsoever, eventually had to just try and guess what size would work for my project and hope for the best.Also, you have to be really careful to get the corner you're punching lined up and inserted correctly or you can easily ruin it. This may also be true of other corner punches, though."
1,Terrible Cut,"Fully expected this to be as good as some of the other punches I have ordered, but not so. It has a terrible punch cut and leaves a raw edge on one side. It is useless to me."
2,Waste of money,This works very well at first. But it gets dull very quickly and bends the corner back instead of trimming it. I would not purchase this product again.
2,Decent for occasional usage,"I concur with other reviewers that it's just ""ok"" because it's not anything special, really. It's only as precise as the person using it because if you're not holding it just right and don't push down on it correctly, it won't necessarily cut the way you'd like it to. It is not meant for thick paper and for multiple sheets of thin paper, for that matter. I think it's really only good for random small things that you don't need to cut often."
4,Super Large,"This punch is the super large one, so don't get it unless your project paper is very large. I was buying it for wedding projects so I needed the small one which I also got. They are very sharp and are still sharp about one year later! Easy to use, but sometimes the cut off edges get stuck in the creases, in which there is an easy fix to that, just remove it. However, the most important things are there, they are easy to use, can cut 100lb card stock easily, I cute two 100lbs at the same time and that was simple, it doesn't go dull quickly and the cuts are smooth and aligned."
4,"A solid, strong corner rounder","This is a great corner rounder. The size is hard to find, and is good for playing cards, business cards, and anything that you want to have a smaller radius rounded corner. It delivers a solid, strong cut even through wood veneer or through several sheets of paper. I own an X-acto corner rounder, and this one is much stronger and easier to use.The only problem is that the die is shaped in such a way that if you're not careful, you can easily accidentally snag the corner you're trying to round, resulting in a uncorrectable jagged corner."
5,good,"I love the concept, and the product does work great. There is a VERY slight , verrry slight bit of paper that does not completely make the smooth corner. But I know no one else would notice it!"
5,Perfect for Invites,This worked perfect to snip the corners off of my daughter's birthday invites. The invites were printed on card stock and the size was 5x7. The corner size was just the right size. Great find!
3,It is ok,"The only con about this punch is the difficulty to align the paper angle with its edge, which causes a non neat edge."
5,rounding things up,"after looking for a corner rounder at hobby & craft stores,with no results i found one on amazon i liked,with good reviews.i use it to round the corners on dvd covers,works great.you do however need to use it upside down to align the cut.the small radius is just what i was looking for. well worth the price."
1,Not for Laminated Cardstock,"Took a while to position the paper properly, but once I figured that out it seemed to work well. Then, after completing approx. 100 laminated cardstock corners, this device began jamming. It's not easy to clear a jam -- must push against punch with fingers and that's hard on the fingers. Also very time-consuming. The more I did the more it jammed. Must conclude that this item is not suitable for cutting the corners on laminated cardstock."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"This book takes the mystery and mysticism out of herbs and nutritional supplements. The authors are objective in their description and count on the use of double-blind studies to determine if a particular substance has an effect on a particular condition. The book has a clever format - there is a section for conditions and a separate section for supplements, making it very easy to quickly find what you want. The book is fully cross-referenced and also lists all scientific publications. The writing style is most engaging, so the book makes a good read as well as a good reference."
2,The Natural Pharmacist : Natural Health Bible from the Most,"While the information in the book is (supposedely) backed by a number of clinical studies, the references aren't included. The book notes that ""so many"" references were used that you must access them through a web site, which is no longer valid, making the material virtually useless when trying to compile a referenced piece. The administrator of the web site offered no explanation or apology (or any way to access the numerous references used). For that reason, I would NOT recommend this book. There are plenty of other resources on natural medicine that include their clincal references in the book."
3,Why Don't We Learn,"This book calls itself the ""bible,"" and is listed under alternative health, but succeeds only in listing ""cures"" and remedies that have plagued Americans since they first started believing that everything has a cure. Read ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,"" instead, and begin there before going to the ""bible"" on herbs and vitamins."
4,Looks pretty good,I have not played it yet but it looks awesome. I have this other game called emergency fire responce and it looks similar to it but much better. The lights flash on the trucks and more detailed. It Looks if so you get to use the hose alot more.
4,"I've had mine since 2002, NO PROBLEMS","I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the low memory space (only 64 MB), and after reading the reviewer from Georgia concerning using a memory card and the problems associated with that, I will continue to use without a memory card. Thanks for the tip.But the product itself is great, very convienent for working out, HEADPHONES ARE PERFECT, don't know why so many people dislikes them. Easy to hook up to my Windows XP and using Musicmatch, didn't have to download anything, it was all automatic.I have used this product overseas on Navy deployments, dropping it, using in high temps, always works great, and LOOKS GOOD! Great sound too. Compared to the other players out there, the low memory space would be a turn-off. But I still have mine after 4 years, and it still works fine."
1,A GREAT IDEA : NEED IMPROVING,"A great idea in developing what most serious gym rats long for: wirefree gadetry on the move and mp3 technology at our finger tips: plus being the first one in my gym with this new gadetry...major bonus point.need improving: headsets cannot withstand sweat, which happens during a hard workout...buring out one side or fading sound.Another problem encountered was a reduction of my allowed 64mb memory to 60.5mb...even after deleting old file...PLEASE REFRAIN FROM PURCHASING UNTIL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE....."
3,"I like it, but the software is.....","I like the player very much. I use it when I go walking. I didn't find the headphones comfortable, so I did change those out. Also, the software they give you with it is just awful! Not intuitive at all. I recommend downloading the free one from MusicMatch. They have a free plug in that handles downloads to the MP3 player - works quite nicely."
1,Recalled yet?,"The Nike PSA Play (both 60 and 120) are inferior MP3 players.I dont know how a credible name like RIO could produce such a lemon.I loved mine for a month. And recommended it to 2 friends. They both purchased the player. I had to exchange mine within 2 months of owning it... for a new one. Both of my friends had defects in their units within 3 months of owning them. One of them was never able to use it properly since the day he opened it.Its support for additional memory is a joke. I have blown 2 MMC cards using this unit. Thanks to the memory companies warranty, this hasn't costed me directly.I would strongly DISCOURAGE anyone who is considering this product. Its not worth the hassle. It looks great, but it doesn't perform and doesn't last."
2,It's ok IF it works,"I bought this MP3 player for jogging after my Rio 300 (which I had for 3 years) quit working. I was hoping that since this product was Nike it would be somewhat durable and would be suitable for activities such as jogging. Unfortunately that was not the case as it isn't suitable for anything.The unit is poorly designed and the software is unreliable at best. The belt clip is a joke. It will not stay clipped for more than 5 minutes given that it doesn't really clip (the lower portion of the ""clip"" actually bends outward rather than inward to grasp your waistband, etc.). The player also has a terrible time identifying expansion memory and the software is unstable.Sonic Blue replaced my player once, but now it has stopped working again, so I have to decided to look for something else."
3,Sonicblue will make you blue,"So far the unit works well but it eats battries when in sleep mode. The software is not that easy to use, although it does work. I found when upgrading the firmware (software) was costly (as you have to pay) and the service is not that great. The external memory card is an MMC but no where do they tell you that nor do they tell you before you buy the MMC card that you have to upgrade the software (firmware). Once these problems were ironed out the rest was easy. While the unit sounds good, get rid of the cheap headphones it comes with, chop around and make sure its right the right one for you.Terry Hutchinso"
4,Works fine with no problems,"This product is older and offers less tahn amny newer MP3 players, but it will get the job done. Here are 3 pieces of advice for owning this player.1. Upgrade the firmware to the lateset 1.62 version2. DO NOT use the included software, use Windows Media Player and install the plug-in.3. Search online to find a couple of spare belt clips, they will break.All things said, this is a good player for a good price."
2,Do NOT buy this,"I bought this NIKE player right when it came out.I went from tape player to CD player to mini-disc playerto finally the NIKE mp3 player.I use portable audio products when i go running or wheni workout at the gym lifting weights.When I first bought the NIKE player, I thought it wasawesome...1. Doesn't skip (like all my previous portable audioplayers)2. Comes with a belt strap for my arm for running anda belt clip when i go lift weights.3. Easy software for mp3 and cd songsetc, etc...However, there are some major problems:1. the port where the remote control/headphone/andUSB connector plugs into broke within several months2. the plastic casing also broke after 6 months3. And the damn entire mp3 player is now on thefritz and doesn't play sometimes when i turn thething onI say buy a more durable, reliable mp3 player.I recommend the Panasonic sdsv80....it's beenawesome so far."
1,what a mistake,"The armband is great - thats the only thing good I can say about this. I've had 3 of them so far and the SonicBlue Customer Service team is terrible. I updated all the firmware, check all the connection ets... and everything was great for the first week - then it stopped working again. So now I am 0 and 3. I wish I had read the reviews before I spent [the money]. What a disappointment."
2,mixed bag,I loved this thing. It was perfect size and had great sound quality. The armband was excellent for running. Then it stopped working and the nightmare began. Customer service was HORRENDOUS and I cannot get the thing to work by following the FAQ.The software that comes with it isn't very good either.Go with the Intel models they are much safer and don't break.
2,"Historic, but not leading edge....","Beer seems at times to have sopped too much of his namesake. Interesting enough from the historic sence much of what is presented here has roots in other works, including Bertalanffy, Powell and Mumford. Fortunately the work is more interesting than one of his lectures!"
4,björn,"Björn Afzelius is one of swedens most famous artist of all time and this is his final work, he suffered from cancer while he recorded this album...I'm not a that big fan of afzelius music but he was a great guy and I have so much respect for him... I'm glad this album was released, but also a bit sad... björn died behore it was released.I don't recommend this CD to people how don't speek swedish, since the lyrics are so important... he sings alot about how unfair to world is. this album is, like most of his works, very political.I really recommand this album, but only as long as you speek or understand swedish."
3,Not the one I thought,It may sound stupid right now.But I bought this to replace the original logo my wife lost after bumping in something.This logo we lost is right in the middle of the car between the hood and the bumper.It has nothing to do with this one.But it may be tricky when reading the package (with the official license from FORD)This name Domed implies that the logo is the 3D type like the one I lost etc...But it is not the case.This one is just a flat and small Ford sticker.
3,Looks great on my kids power wheels ...,"I added these to my kids power wheels f150 raptor. look great, and are the bubbly type, bendable material. these are not metal or hard plastic."
3,Works well.,"Bought at local Target about 4/10 works well in normal 3 way fixture upright. Gives decent instant light level, but takes several minutes for full output. High level provides good reading light. Color rendering fair to good. Warm color temp. Think I paid $18 or so. Seems expensive but power savings probably justifies - have run hundreds of hrs on low wit useful room light from typical stand lamp with normal A-19 3way fixture. Posting of ecodrivel has bvious bias and no technical merit."
5,Excellent!,I am a long time fan of Bette Midler and Stephen Collins movies. They are a pleasure to watch. Excellent drama well written keeps you entertained.
5,Stella DVD,"I purchased this for my teenage daughter in an attempt to explain, in story form, the trials and tribulations that girls go through with their mothers. I wanted to represent our differences using this format in the hopes that she would connect our issues with the characters in the movie. Plus, I LOVE Bette Midler and when I saw this 20 years ago I was touched by her courage as a mother. The movie, Stella, is about a mother who doesn't have much education but raises her daughter to value education, and subtly urges her to make a life better than her own. What I liked about Bette Midler's character was her acceptance of her own life, and love for her daughter...despite her daughter's harsh judgments of her."
2,Horrid Message,"A few clarifying comments-I adore Bette Midler. How can't I?I also adored this movie -- right up until the end.The film is nothing particularly Earth shattering. It is, however, a sweet, well told, genuine story of a single mother's relationship with her daughter.My mother took me to see this in the theater when I was very young -- probably only 7 or 8 years old. I recently rented it, remembering having liked it as a child.It held up -- the movie was still moving, still touching.My MAJOR complaint is with the ending.We are made to believe that a lower income, blue collar single mother can't succesfully raise a child without lying to her, convincing her she doesn't want her anymore, and turning her over to her richer father. What kind of values are these. Worse, what kind of message does it send about the effectiveness of single mothers?As the child of an exquisite single mother, I resent the assertion that I had nary a chance to make it without the presence of a wealthy male."
1,What a piece of trash!,"I love Bette Midler, but this movie is a dog! I still can't believe that we are supposed root for girl who ostracizes her poor (meaning low-income) mother to married some rich jerk. Avoid at all costs!"
5,"""STELLLLLLLLLLLLA!""","Quoted by Marlon Brando, the title of my review is how i feel about this film. My mother turned me on to this film, so it has sentimental value to me. Bette Midler gives a raunchy yet riveting performance as Stella Dallas, a fiesty, headstrong single mother raising her illigimate daughter, Jenny. Both actresses play out their characters with love and emotion. You can tell that they both actually cared about the characters they were playing and it shows through their performances. Standing ovations for both Bette Midler and Trini Alvarado. There is also wonderful acting all across the board in this film. John Goodman plays an intoxicating drunk with heart! Stella is the kind of movie that will make you laugh and cry, sincerely. Especially if you have a close relationship with your mother."
2,Not so Good as Beaches,"The movie that followed Bette Midler's highly successful BEACHES, this doesn't work as well mainly because it is not as good as the original and it was set in the 60s when it could have easily worked in the time period the movie was filmed. Bette plays a mother who can't give the best to her daughter and slowly pushes her away which causes her daughter to go to her father to live. Bette doesn't seem to really fit this role as a more dramatic actress such as Susan Sarandon or Meryl Streep would have effectively fit this role. John Goodman and Trini Alvarado as well as Martha Mason and Stephen Collins all give good performances that very well keep the movie going. BUt the movie is too slow and too old-looking and there is only so much that anyone including Bette could do. See Bette's Beaches or FOR THE BOYS instead."
3,Stella,"This movie was okay and although a little disjointed at times, it was worth watching. Bette Midler is always excellent value for money.It had an absurd ending but Bette did well with a so so script."
5,Adolescent Bibliotherapy,"Dead Meat is a stark description of the urban cultural challenges of adolescents who struggle to fit in and also meet parental expectations. It is bibliotherapy for youth that feel they are facing insurmountable problems. This story is a realistic, fresh picture of contemporary cultural challenges. Dead Meat clearly defines the elements of power and friendship, both idealistically and realistically. Adolescents are able to see that there are answers that go beyond submitting to gang power and violating parental trust. This book inspires courageous strength in the mean streets of youth."
5,Dead Meat,"Gang life and gang culture are depicted in the voice of a young man, Mitch, who wants desperately to do the right thing, but is faced with the reality of trying to stay alive. With the help of friends, family and spiritual conviction, Mitch faces the reality of far too many young people in our society today. In this poignant tale of a young man's struggle to 'do the right thing,' the reader experiences the sounds, smells and texture of violence, fear, courage and triumph. Though this book is of heavy content, the writer handled the issues in a thoughtful, compelling manner. Teens and preteens will recognize the struggle with peer pressure even if they do not relate to the physical setting of the book. Mitch's challenges in an inner city school are not that different from any other teenager trying to fit into a new group. Recommended for Middle and High School readers."
2,Doesn't necessarily promote health,"I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me."
1,disappointed,I was very interested in this book and diet program until I found out that herbalife was involved. I am a student that really can't afford to support another network marketing company. I don't have anything against them but I can't afford their stuff either. I thought this was going to be something realistic.
3,worth a try,I have purchased and read the book and will be giving this a try. For those of you that have been successful....what brand of soy protein are you using? I have found one at GNC. Not willing to buy the very expensive Herbalife product. Help.
3,Kaiser 5-pc Tinplate,I ordered this mainly for the springform pan as I make alot of cheesecakes. The pieces aren't very sturdy but do the job & the whole set costs less than I would have paid for just the springform pan alone.
3,Quoizel Lafayette 30 Inch Table Lamp,"Nice lamp. For the price the company should have put something on the bottom of the lamp like a piece of felt. I would not pay the full price for this item, and I am not sure I would have bought it if it wasn't for an Amazon Gift Certificate I received."
4,great tool,Great tool for stripping wires. I do wish they lasted longer. I use them every day and they last about a year. They're pretty inexpensive so its not a huge deal.
5,LA INFORMACION LIMPIA E INDISPENSABLE,"PARA LOS ADOLESCENTES...NI LO DUDEN, AMIGOS...NI LA ESCUELA NI LOS PADRES LES ENSEÑAMOS LO SUFICIENTE...Y ESTE LIBRO COMPLEMENTA LO QUE DE NOSOTROS APRENDEN PARA PROTEGERSE CUANDO ESTAN SOLOS..Y precisamente cuando están solos es CUANDO ESTAN EN GRAVE PELIGRO !ES ENTONCES CUANDO LOS CONOCIMIENTOS DE ESTE LIBRO LOS PONEN A SALVO !"
5,charger for phone,wife really likes having something for the phone she has especially when going in the car to her appointed rounds-another way to use another power source besides the one at home
4,Timken bearings,Had to order a third bearing because the ABS sensor wire was bad on one of the first two and I wasn't going to spend the time to remove the whole bearing for just a simple sensor. Hopefully they last as long as the OEMs
3,Photo great...packaging awful,"Great product...the picture was beautiful, high quality. However, the cheap bums put it in a soft envelope with no cardboard to protect it. Of course, the picture is a wrinkled mess. Shame."
2,Not as good as Expected,"I got this case and it looks like a cheaper version of the one shown. It was brown and I thought it would be black. The inside liner was not glued down smooth in one spot (meaning it has a ripple). The outside covering at the edges were not glued down well at the curve on both sides where the neck meets the body. It does not have the metal medallion on the front side of the neck that is suppose to say ""Takemine"". It just has ""Takemine Guitars"" faintly painted on the top."
3,Not the first place to start,"Not a bad effort, and instructive in terms of general strategies and pawn structure (which appears to be the aim of the ""Mastering"" series.) However, as an intermediate player trying to learn the opening, I felt that it was lacking in terms of nuts and bolts. A book like John Emms's ""Easy Guide to the Nimzo-Indian"" would be a better place to start."
3,"Good, but thin","The information is this book and its presentation are very good. If you are in the market for a strategic primer then you won't be disappointed. The weakness is that there is not quite enough. Not enough games. No repertoire hints. Little insight into what the author thinks about the merits of each variation - a little too disinterested. You will need more. But what's there is good and is well worth your time and money. As another reviewer claims though, this isn't nearly up to the standard of the better Mastering the XYZ books (eg. French, Spanish).Unrelated to this book, but maybe helpful to readers - if you are lucky enough to have your lines covered in Mastering the Chess Openings 2 (Watson) it contains very useful commentary. But it is very selective in the lines it covers, so you might not get lucky."
5,Chevalier is wonderful,Tracy Chavalier is a master at having art history come alive and incorporate within it a beautiful story.
4,Lovely Writing!,"I really enjoyed this book, and finished it pretty quickly. The characters were lovely and really had their own individual personalities, and Chevalier really takes you to the 1660's in this book. I am now looking foward to reading more from her"
4,Wonderful descriptions...,"This book was very good, and it is a very fast read (it took me two evenings). A friend recommended it to me, knowing my interest in art; and at first I was a bit apprehensive because the book is more description than plot. However, it was wonderful; and even though the book was very descriptive, Chevalier doesn't get too lost in her own words. The book is told in the first person, which I think was a wise decision on the author's part. It is the thoughts of the main character that make the story worth reading, watching her take in the world around her and respond to it. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the conflict in the book was a bit anticlimatic -- I think that the description on the back of the book makes it seem that there is more going on in the story than there actually is. But, beyond that (and my disappointment was really just the result of my own expectations), the book was wonderful. I highly recommend it."
5,"More, More!","One of the best books on art in recent years, this little volume is packed with insight into the painting in question and a marvelous tale about the painting's subject. This book is a page turner in a different way from a suspense novel, yet the author engages you in the life of this girl to such an extent you must find out how it all ends. One of the most entertaining items I have read for some time.One can only hope this author is not done exploring the Dutch masters and perhaps other artists as well!"
5,Cultural differces,"I really liked the book, because it made me understand the melancholic smile on the girl's face and left me with silent questions to think about for days.The ""simple"" writing style of Ms. Chevalier got lots of criticism, that I can only explain with the non-understanding of the era, the culture 300 years ago, the protestant Puritanism, and the way Vermeer worked (which was as well a reflection of his time). This novel gives a good view of the 17th century Holland (not Sweden as some readers assumed) and the language of the book just ads to it.It is not action but emotion packed, and probably you need to slow down to the speed of these days to realize that.The Girl with a Pearl Earring is written the way Vermeer painted her beauty and grace. You can not compare with the tension you find on a tortured Modigliani face, but then read a book of his life and you get all the screaming and shouting you miss from that book."
1,Pedestrian,"I've gotten two-thirds of the way through this book and I'm not sure I'm going to finish it. ""Why,"" I ask myself, ""am I reading this unromantic, pedantic, academic book? Nothing about it works, from the telling of the tale in the first person to the unlikely possibility that Vermeer needed help with his subject matter. Lusterless and Pedestrian."
1,Griet knows everything at the beginning. What's to learn?,"There is no journey worth sticking around to learn about. This narrator is so wise, and just keeps moving on, knowing everyone's motives at the start. She isn't interesting, this is a very placcid, superficial read. Her ability leave her family so easily wasn't real and fit right into another world. Very disappointing read."
2,Missed the mark.,"I loved the historical aspects of the book, and the descriptions of everydaylife. The characters were well fleshed out. However, I felt they were passionless, lacking in wit, kindness, and character. No one in the book has a sense of humor, most of the characters are surly, and they all tip toe around each others' emotions. Also, I did not care for the sexist treatment of the main character, and her acceptance of this as what she deserved. In all, the book left me as warm as a Dutch sky in January."
5,Best book I've read this year,"This is the best book I've read all year. The author's description of Holland in the 1600s is so vivid, it feels like you are walking the cobbled streets alongside the main character. At the same time, she has not cluttered her book with mundane descriptions or details. Her language is simple and crisp, easy on the reader. The story itself is graceful, but riveting. It's like listening to fine music. You want to see what happens next, but at the same time, you don't want it to end."
2,Entertaining but no masterpiece,"I read this book in two days. While it was appealing to me as a person interested in art and gave me a renewed appreciation of Vermeer, it has little more to offer than that. The writing is cut and dry and the characters are just generic, paper-doll types (the humble maid, her witch of a mistress, the more understanding elderly lady). Chevalier seems afraid to develop too much the character of Jan Vermeer lest her description strays too far from historical accuracy. This is a bland novel with an anticlimatic, yet realistic, ending."
2,It started off good,"The book started off a good read, tenison and sorrow. However I was left with the feeling the author lost interest about half way through. I am not a student of this time period so was left confused over several plot twists such as why would being painted in a picture lead to ruin?"
1,:((,"I was highly disappointed with this book! The language is simple and boring, characters are not developed, plot is not involving, ending is predictable. It felt like reading a poorly written romance that you can pick up at a gas station. I would not recommend it to anybody!"
2,Tak it or leave it.,"This is something that I would read if I have a long wait in the doctor's office. The plot is interesting enough, but everything is lopsided and flat. There is not any real back stories to the characters themselves. A lot of things are based on local market gossip with almost no explination. What really bothered me is that Griet sounds more educated than she really is. She is barely semi-literate. It says in the book that all she knows is only to write her name and read her prayer book. She cannot read somebody else's hand writing or printed words in anything else. That really bothered me. We don't really get to know her family in depth and that was a big plot hole."
2,YAAAAWWWWNNNNNNNNN,"Not quite sure why this continues to be on bestseller lists. I found this book to be rather empty. Great idea to tell a story behind a paiting -- but beyond that, the story isn't that original."
1,Banal and Mediocre at /best,"WOW,what an overrated work!!!! Frankly, I don't understand all the accolades. There is not one original or interesting character in the book. The author serves up every stereotypical family member imaginable; the talented and somewhat dysfunctional artist, the amazinlgly spoiled, vapid and selfish wife, the tough as nails wise old crone of a mother/mother-in-law with the obligatory heart of gold, the nasty little demon-child daugher, and the protagonist peasant girl who is superior in every way, mentally, morally and culturally to any of the other charcters, except perhaps the ""master"" who does her in the end with the post of an earring. It goes beyond laughable directly to the realm of Hollywood material.If you aren't a very ciritical reader or if you are not familiar with Vermeer's works, this is up your ally but if you don't have much time on your hands and you want to read something of substance pass this one by."
4,Pleasant book for summer reading,"Great book! Chevalier paints a picture of the girl every bit as compelling as the Vermeer painting itself. It is a carefully crafted glimpse into the dutch domestic life of the 17th century. Griet, the girl of the title, is a portrait of her times and the circumstances that create her alliance with the great artist. It is a deceptively simple book that stays with the reader long after the last pages are completed. I wanted to read more and find out everything about her life and the little town. I had purchased this book back in May - but put it away to read during our summer vacation and I am so glad I had the time to savor the story. Chevalier uses prose in a most compact yet descriptive manner and draws characters skillfully. I would read it again - I probably will shortly! Thank you for a great story."
3,A Fair Book,"I was attracted to this book because of the original concept; also because I am a teen myself, much interested in art and art history. But perhaps my expectations were too high, because I was disappointed in it. I didn't feel I could relate to the main character, and I felt the ""girl against the world"" theme was overdone. Overall, I just felt the characters and storyline were too unbelievable.I would recommend this book for a rainy day, but rent it from the library. Don't waste your money on it."
4,girl with a pearl earing,Well written historical fiction.Tracy Chevalier brings the reader into the world of a great artist as well as his servent girl. I tried to purchase her 1st novel only to find it had gone out of print. Hopefully the publisher will reprint her first if it is as good as The Girl With a Pearl Earing.
2,Incredible,"Incredible in the sense of being difficult to believe, and not in the sense of being amazingly good. Three examples:An uneducated maid should not be expected to understand art better than an accomplished painter -- especially one of the stature of Vermeer. Yet Griet tells us she changed the composition of two of Vermeer's paintings, including the title piece, noting that she could see what needed to be changed before Vermeer did.Second, Griet speaks with an unexpectedly lyrical voice for someone who cannot read (except for her name). How she came to learn such poetical construction without proper schooling is unclear.Finally, the scene in the alley with Pieter -- after Griet shows her hair to Vermeer -- defies all credibility. It is completely out of character.This book is a fine diversion for a few hours, but it is not a great novel."
4,Stop hesitating. Worth your time.,"It took a year for me to buy this book, and I wish someone had told me to spend the time and money earlier. Chevalier maintains a voice throughout Girl with a Pearl Earring that builds a character, a time, and a life that is both that of a young poor maid in 17th century Holland and of her broader culture. It takes you into a world full of tensions as timeless as men and women, rich and poor, upstairs and downstairs, but without the violence, language and graphic sex expected in today's world. And all are driven by the unerring voice of Griet."
5,work of art,"I loved this book! The painting on the cover of the book caught my attention and I could not stop reading. Griet was wonderful! The story read like a painting. Just as Vermeer's work looks like photographs of daily life. When I finished this book I felt like i had lived in that time and place also. And under different circumstances, Griet could hve been a great painter also!"
4,"An enjoyable, literary read.","This is a delightful novel. The story seems to sparkle in the Dutch sunlight of the 17th century. It contains the characteristics of many great works of literature- symbolism, foreshadowing etc, yet the plot moves along quickly.It helps to be familiar with art of the era (Rembrant and others in addition to Vermeer). This is a book that can be savored while the art brings it to life.I also appreciated the description of various painting techniques illustrated by the author.This is definately worth your time!"
4,Girl with a Pearl Earring,"I recently visited the Vermeer exhibit in NYC and was captivated by the beauty of his work. I saw this book displayed in the youth section of the library, but because of the subject matter I decided to give it a read, not expecting ""great literature"". I was pleasently surprised by the authors beautiful use of words and although the main character was somewhat contradictory, it was a thoroughly satisfying book."
2,Nothing Ever Happens...,"I heard so much about this book but I felt that not only were the characters underdeveloped but the story was as well. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen, and nothing ever did.There were so many directions she could have taken this simple story, and instead it led disappointingly nowhere."
5,A must-read!!,"This book is one of my top ten favorites. Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down."
1,Awful historical fiction!,"The book is written in the first person, the narrator being a teenaged maid. Apart from the fact thtthte style is unconvincing (no teenager I know could think like this), the plot resembles a Victorian softcore s and m romance more than it does life in the 17th Ct. Netherlands. What is particualrly odd is that we're supposed to like the narrator, a thoroughly ungenerous, judgmental, superior, witholding, and smug character who is basically a Daddy's girl. She is happy to criticize the other women in the household in order to get Vermeer's attention, as if she were saying, ""Daddy, daddy, I can clean better than they can. Paint me (Guess what else) me too!"" The novel tells us next to nothing about Vermeer, his painting, or the process of painting them. Nor does it tell us anything about being a model. If you want to read good historical fiction, look elsewhere."
2,"Well written, but not too good","This book was okay... Very well written, nice descriptions, well developed charecters, belivible events ect...But the book has little plot, no real story line and untimitly goes nowhere. Rather like everyday life. If you want to hear about everyday life (as I know some do) then you will love this book.But if you'd enjoy some plot, a bit of story and something more then day to day stuff, then this book is not for you. It is also reletivly slow to develope into even appriciatable work.Something for anyone who reads this to know, this book is highly over rated and if you read with those expectations you will be dissapointed."
1,Audio book reader sounds like an old woman,"Don't purchase the audiobook version read by Ruth Ann Phimister.The main character is a girl, ergo, The *Girl* With a Pearl Earring.The reader sounds like she's pushing 80. Very irritating. I kept having to tell myself that the story was being recounted by the girl when she was an old lady, but there's nothing in the actual book to suggest this.How can a recorded book company go so wrong in chosing the voice of their reader? It's simply maddening."
2,What would Vermeer think?,"I personally adore art, history, Vermeer, and creative writing, but I found, in this case, the author's attempt to blend all of these elements into a meaningful novel turned out largely unimaginative."
3,"Good, but a slow start...","I found this book to be hard to get into at first, I'm not sure why. However, after, I felt the author really took us into the life of Griet, who goes to be a maid in the artist Vermeer's household, and what life was like in 1660s Holland. We see Griet grow from a wide-eyed innocent into a woman who learns who handle Vermeer's wife, his children (including one who is always out to get her), his mother-in-law, and the other maid in the house, along with attention from men! I found the descriptions of the paintings by Griet, someone who was not supposed to be used to viewing such fine pieces of art, to be extremely pleasing."
4,Girl With A Pearl Earring,"Her gaze is mysterious. Many have wondered where the painting of the Girl With A Pearl Earring came from. What's the history behind it? Why did Vermeer paint a painting that was so atypical for him? Tracy Chevalier paints a picture of what her imagination sees when she looks at this mysterious girl of almost 4 and one half centuries ago.Griet is a poor girl in the town of Delft in the Netherlands. Her father was an expert ceramic tile painter until his sight was taken by a horrible explosion. Now, to help support her family, Griet was sent to be a maid for the Vermeers. Griet is forced into the real world. She has to deal with a mistress that is somewhat less than desirable and a child of the mistress that seems out to get her at every corner."
3,"Good, if simplistic, novel","This novel is definitely not a great work of literature, in my opinion, but the story is engaging and it is easy to read. The main problem with the novel is that it does not have any subplots, in addition to Griet's life as a servant, to ""jazz it up"" a bit. I found that because of this, the short novel became a little boring at times. Still, the characters are lively and the ""what if...?"" idea is inventive."
2,Girl with a Pearl Earring,This book was a 1 day read and other than giving a new way of looking at art it did not delve deep enough into the charachters. It would on the other hand be great for 12 year old girls.
3,I wanted more than this book gave me.,"Having read many of the reviews on this site, I wanted much more than this book actually had to offer. I wanted more art history. I wanted a clearer picture of life in Delft at the time the story was set. But most of all, I wanted more story and more character development. This book just didn't grab me. I love the IDEA of a book describing the events that lead up to a painting I am familiar with, but in my opinion the story simply doesn't live up to the idea. . ."
1,Girl With a Pearl Earing,"This book was TRITE, unconvincng in dialoque and time. The premise was intriguing at first, but the story fell apart when she began discribing the painters life, and the way he worked. Even her vocabulary of the about painting and his glazing technic was nonsence. The silliness of her relationship in the household irritated me rather than intrigue me. I have read this basic story line a thousand time, in a thousand books, and alot of them were better written than this one.I wasted four hours of my life reading this nonsence. This was supposed to have been about about Vermeer and it wasn't, his name and painting was used as a hook by the author to sell her book."
3,Very Acurate if a little over technical,"This book is set in the Netherlands in the 18th century. It tells the story of a painter and his servant/assistant. There is an engaging story throughout and every effort is made to keep historical acuracy.The book is very heavy on the technical details of painting which I found to be rather irrelevant. It is however, a worth while read."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dull","This book presents nothing to keep a listener interested: no intrigue, no mystery, no PLOT, no character development. I must've trudged through 7/8 of the story, and then I was sidetracked by something more urgent. Two days later, I could not care less what would happen in the story and so I have not finished it. (I lasted through 7/8 from mild curiosity, and I was on a cruise with a lot of time for just listening as the oceans sailed by.)"
2,"Sorry, I found it boring...","Actually, we read this in our book club and nicknamed it ""The Practical Tramp"". Outside of a mildly interesting view of the era, the characters weren't all that likeable or relatable."
1,this book put me off,"Our heroine attracts, ""the master's"" attention by her superior ability to clean his studio. Fifty pages later she summons enough nerve to criticize his artwork by rearranging a cloth.This is one of those books you keep reading because you think that sooner or later something's gonna happen.It never does."
1,Girl with a Pearl Earring,I purchased a 'used' DVD. When I watched it there were a couple of skipped spots that the movie slowed down but then clicked back into place. this was around the middle. I decided they weren't too bad I didn't mind. Then at the very end of the movie the disc became sluggish and slowed down to hardly moving at all. I waited hoping it would clicked back into the regular speed of the movie like it did before. This time it didn't it stayed on the same frame advancing extremely slowly barely moving forward until the movie was over.Now my DVD player isn't working! I a very dissatisfied customer. I don't want to give this any stars but I can't submit it unless I do. I won't buy anymore 'used' anything from AMAZON. It's not even worth returning the DVD it will cost me more then the original price of $2.41.I'm not happy I don't have a DVD player now! What do you do in these circumstances? It was sold by pieceofmindmedia. How do I get in touch with them?JPeroni
2,Ugh!,"This is a very crass book. If you're looking for a clean, inspirational book, this is NOT it. I only have this book because it was a reading assignment for college. Not a favorite on my list."
5,"Insightful, intuitive verbal portrait of life in Holland in","Tracy Chevalier creates an opportunity for the reader to step back in time -- to see, smell, hear, and feel the nuances of life in this part of the world 340 years ago. Its intimacy is the greatest pleasure. This is the story of one woman's life. Griet, the girl with a pearl earring, has extraordinary viusal intelligence. Her words exude unconscious, rich sensuality uniquely combined with a clear-sighted practicality. The story is written as if we were invisible observers privileged to read her unguarded thoughts. Her innocence is in conrast to her critical visual analysis of the world's beauties and uglinesses. With words, she paints the same detailed pictures for our imagination's eyes as Vermeer painted for our physical eyes. She sees more than most. She says less than most. The words she does use are as carefully chosen as Vermeer's surprise contrasts. Less is more. She and Vermeer are kindred spirits. Haunting."
3,A nice weekend read,"Once started, Girl With a Pearl Earring is difficult to put down. There are no quirky characters or exciting plot twists, yet you are drawn into Griet's world, and want to know what becomes of her. The book can be easily read in a weekend, and is perfect for a short ""escape"". While there was little about the book to ponder after putting it aside, it is a wonderful book for anyone curious about art or history."
2,Light and Fluffy,"While this novel is ""richly imagined,"" it lacks sophistication and depth, and the writing style leaves a lot to be wished for. Vermeer has long been one of my favorite artists, but -- while I think this is an intriguing topic -- it needs, perhaps, a different author to handle it. The book has a vacuous, ""goodie-goodie"" feel that strikes me as being aimed at adolescent readers rather than at adults."
5,Another of the best!,"This book was one I really enjoyed. It is historical fiction set in 16th century Holland. The main character is sent by her family to work for the Vermeer Household as a maid, because her father can no longer work. Vermeer (whom by the way was a real artist) hires her to clean his studio without moving anything from its proper place. I had a wonderful experience in my art History class, and really enjoyed learning more about how things truly were, even though this book is partially fictional. It tells of Greit's life story and has a truly wonderful ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys art, or just a good read; however, some parts were a bit risque. But that did not affect the reading at all. This was truly a wonderful book. I hope my review has helped you!"
4,Girl with the Pearl Earring,"Go back to a time when the classic painters were honing their talents, and you find yourself immersed in this beautiful novel that is a sort-of biography of Vermeer. After reading this book, I felt I knew all his secrets for producing his beautiful paintings filled with light. The story is seen in the eyes of a young servant girl who later becomes the subject of the title painting. Her feelings as a girl maturing into a young woman are heart wrenching. Well worth reading!"
2,very disappointing,"I heard so much about this book I thought it would be worthwhile, but it was really disappointing. The plot is paper thin, the characters are flat, and there doesn't seem to be a point other than describing the ""story"" of this painting. Struck me as an MFA writing exercise rather than a real novel. Also had my pet peeve - a totally unrealistic villian who is evil ""just because"" - has no apparent reason to be in conflict with the main character yet pursues her destruction with bizzare singlemindedness (made worse in this case since the villian is a child! What child can concentrate on one thing for 24 hours, much less years of careful manipulation to destroy someone whom she has no real reason to hate?) I wouldn't reccommend it. Maybe it's popular just because it's so simple - unintimidating for people unused to reading."
1,"Overrated, slow and dull...","Unless you're familiar with Vermeer going in, there's not much to offer to those of us who aren't followers of 17th century Flemish art. The book is purposely slow, the main protagonist is too mature beyond her years and there are only one or two ""scenes"" in the book that are key to what the novel is all about. People who will most appreciate this book will have general knowledge of the artist and already be captivated by the painting. For such a slim volume, one would have expected more emotion and charm. Instead, this is a book that, while short, is not a page turner. You can literally put this book down and come back to it, but not for the right reasons for a novel. Strictly for readers who prefer mood, subtle gestures and a somber tone. No revelations or earth-shattering statements here... The book's jacket, however, gets five stars..."
2,Clumsy writing style is no match for Vermeer,"I found this novel impossible to finish, mainly because the clumsy, self-conscious style started to grate with me pretty quickly. The narrator is a servant girl; so the author adopts what she thinks is a child-like narrative voice. But this does not stop her indulging in an endless parade of clumsy metaphors. Eyes are 'gray like the sea'; hair 'red like wet brick', her mother's eyes are 'two warnings' (because she has two eyes? Oh dear) - and all this on page 1. The idea, it appears, is that, despite her lack of education, this simple girl is possessed of an artist's eye. But do painters think in endless drab metaphors? I doubt it. Visual art, by definition, is a process that's impossible to evoke in words. And these artless efforts, for me at least, fell woefully short. While there are some carefully researched period details, this doesn't compensate for for an dreary prose style that never feels anything other than late 20th Century."
2,unimpressed,"I was so excited to read this book--every time I saw it in the book store I thought..this is the next one! However, upon finishing the novel I am left with a sense of longing for a deeper, more richly worded novel, and a plot that does not leave one hanging on for more. The plot is too simple and ends with little to no resolution. Griet realizes very little about herself, and we are left not liking or especially disliking Vermeer. One would like to cultivate a reader's relationship with him as well. I wanted much more in this novel."
2,What's all the fuss,"I was dissapointed in this novel. From the hype I was expecting to be transported to 17th C. Holland, and to understand more about the great painter Vermer. Wrong. Nothing happens, no insight, no layers of meaning. Perhaps a good children's book--but really, what is the fuss!"
3,What was the point?,"You know, I found this well written, but it left me wondering, what was the point?Also, why all the secrecy that she was helping the artist with his colors? You would expect the servants in that era to help with this task. Didn't get that part at all.However, liked the milieu depicted and overall enjoyed the book."
3,Better on the Historical Aspects,"I will confess that I watched the film before reading the book, and I will also admit that I did enjoy the film version a bit more. I am a fan of the artist Vermeer, and was more interested in his character in ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" than I was with the character of Griet. Not a bad read, though. The back drop of 1600s Holland saved the chick-lit plot line of the book. I will recommend this book to those who like fairy tale stories. Griet is a kind of Dutch Cinderella who goes from simple servant, to muse, to wife."
1,Girl with the Pearl Earrings,The style of writing in this novel was appropriate for a ten year old girl who is just beginning to read novels. I would not recommend this for adults.
3,interesting coffee table book,it was an easy read but not a thrilling story but yet it gives a book group many things to ponder
4,"A nice, quick read.","This book is truly inspiring, to look at a piece of art then write a story about it makes you look at fine art in a different light. The author's descriptive narratives on Vemeer's use of light and colors in his paintings was most interesting."
3,Art lesson,"Another book that features art by Vermeer. The story is well written, but the main characters never really grabbed my attention. I could never feel the pull of the art or artist, as in the Girl in Hyacinth Blue."
2,What do people see in this book?,"""I was chopping vegetables in the kitchen when I heard voices outside our front door--a woman's, bright as polished brass, and a man's, low and dark like the wood of the table I was working on. They were the kind of voices we heard rarely in our house. I could hear rich carpets in their vioces, books and pearls and fur.I was glad that earlier I had scrubbed the front steps so hard.My mother's voice--a cooking pot, a flagon--approached from the front room""Most of the prose is unsophisticated, but might have been fine considering it is written in first person and the protagonist is young teenager, but ridiculous passages like this (from the first page) stand out. The strained metaphors only get worse as you read on. The characters are unsympathetic and worse, unbelieveable, and the plot is paper thin."
2,disappointed,"I must have read another book. After reading so many good reveiws on this book I ran out and bought it. I should have saved my $13. It just seemed like through the entire book you were waiting for something to happen, anything! But it never does there is really no turning point, no pinnacle moment in the entire story. I fell in love with the characters but it just seemed like the author didn't know what to do with them once she created them. Save the $13 and see a good movie."
3,More Than Brush Strokes,"Tracy Chevalier has come up with a very creative and ingenious plot and a very readable novel. It is easy to understand how she may have been inspired by this particular Vermeer painting and its subject, to tell her story, promise of which was captured for eternity by the most famous of the Dutch Masters.The delivery is less brilliant, and dialogues seem less than authentic at times. Sure, there are glimpses of the 17th century Dutch daily life, business of art of painting, grind of keeping a medieval house functioning and the fragility of human life, but one does not exactly get transported to the time and place while reading this novel.Still, it was a pleasant book, worth the read"
1,What's the big fuss?,What's the big fuss about this book? I think it's selling because of the beautiful art on the cover. The story is just so predictable and so much like every other romantic story told. Perhaps people like the accurate historical detail? I'm sure the general public couldn't tell if it was accurate anyway.
5,The Girl in the Vermeer Portrait,"This book is a fictionalized account of a woman in a Vermeer portrait. Chevalier recreates the landscape and environment of Delft, Netherlands while exploring Vermeer's relationship to Griet, the family's maid. The book follows Griet as she enters Vermeer's household first as a maid and later as Vermeer's assistant. Vermeer asks her to pose for a painting and suggests she put on his wife's pearl earring.The book's style is gentle and depictive, evoking a sensibility of place and time with undercurrents of passion and longing, usually understated but clear.This is a very good novel."
4,"Great painting, good book.","This good book took me back to times long ago when life was so very different. It had a very good story line. However, toward the end it got off track and the plot was lost for a while. Because of the ending I gave the book a 4 star rating. Pity really as with a little more care at the end the author could have had a classic on her hands."
2,"Decent, but over-hyped.","This wasn't a poorly written novel by any means, and was quite poignant at times. But it just didn't hold my attention as much as I thought a book this popular should."
1,STINKS,SO BORING BEYOND BELIEF. I HATED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS WAY TOO SLOW AND UNCAPTIVATING BY ALL MEANS.
2,"A Good Idea, But...","As someone who is amazed by Vermeer's work, and who wanted more after seeing his works in the ""Delft School"" exhibit at the Met, I picked up""Girl"" to read on the plane. Although the idea is very unique - fictionalizing the story of a girl in a Vermeer painting - the execution falls short. Chevalier's writing is pretty trite and not very unique. i found myself rolling my eyes far too often at suggestions that this little girl gave The Master ideas on how to paint, such as putting a cloth across a table, etc. If you are annoyed by simplistic portraits and VERY SHORT sentences such as ""The day was ending. The sun was almost set."" don't bother with this book. Yes, it will help you pass the time (about 2 hours) but why not be enlightened by great or even very good writing instead?"
2,Skin deep,"After all the hype, this is disappointing. Lawrence Johnson's review below (dated February 8) says it all.If this book aspires to anything, it is sexual coming-of-age for the heroine. Anticipation and tension lend an erotic air, but the story never really lifts off. The bits about art and Vermeer's life may be gleaned from artbooks or biographies.It's like superior Mills & Boon romance, with its stereotypes: the downtrodden heroine, the sexy, enigmatic master, quasi-evil patrons, jealous wives/mothers/daughters. Unfortunately the narrative is limited to the single perspective of the self-satisfied Griet. But other viewpoints, such as that of her suitor, the sexy but smelly young butcher Pieter, or her antagonist, the vindictive Cornelia, would have given more light and shade."
3,Easy to read,I found the book to be enjoyable and an easy read. The characters and places were described beautifully so that I could easily create my own mental picture of them. Chevalier captures the whimsy and the complexity of a young girl caught up in a world in which she has little control. I could identify with many of the emotions of the main character.
4,A wonderful surprise!,I wouldn't have picked this book up by myself but read it because it was a choice of my book club. It was a wonderful surprise! Even though it was set in the 1600's it was easy to read and a story that tells much more than just a story. Hidden meanings that were conveyed by our club members. A good book that will surprise you!
3,Slo-mo,"The book, as one could easily imagine, was displayed in the window of every bookshop in Holland. I fell victim to this blatant propaganda.Not that I regretted. It was a nice peaceful read, and the author evidently did her recearch. The storyline seemed a little too obvious; there was no feeling of mystery, of strange tingling light, which one can really feel in any of Vermeer's paintings. And the approach to the ""woman's view"" seemed a little simplistic to me.On the other hand, when I went to see the picture in Mauritshuis in The Hague (and it looks nothing like the reproductions, nothing at all - same is true for the view of Delft, also on the cover, also in Mauritshuis), I greeted Griet as an old acquaintance."
4,Lovely historical novel,"I enjoyed this unusual historical novel. The portrait ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" by the famous Dutch painter, Vermeer, apparently is considered ""the Dutch Mona Lisa"" because of the girl's enigmatic look as she gazes at the painter. This book tells a possible story explaining the painting. It revolves around a young maid who worked at the painter's house, and who was enthralled with his work (and him). The story takes place in the highly stratified and puritanical Dutch culture of the mid 17th century. When I finished the book, I felt that I has just read a beautiful fable."
5,PERFECT!!,This is my favorite book of all time! It just doesn't get any better. It has a great storyline and is very well written. It's very easy to read. I could read it over and over. I highly recommend it. I will forever be a Tracy Chevalier fan and so will you.
5,Stunning,"Just as some paintings leave you stunned and awed by their beauty, so does this book Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. I couldn't put it down. It is a beautiful story, one you will not regret having read."
4,Enjoyable,"Speculative fiction about Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer or, more specifically, about the girl in one of his most famous paintings, Girl with a Pearl Earring. Griet starts off as a maid in the painter's house but she is soon made his assistant and eventually his model. While this is going on she also has to deal with being away from home for the first time, Vermeer's wife and daughter's jealousy, and her growing attraction to the painter.Not the kind of book I usually read but it was enjoyable. It was a bit on the slow side but the book itself was short so that didn't really bother me. It could also be vague in places but this is one of those books where some things are better left to the imagination. If you are an art dork or you just like good fiction in general you'll probably enjoy this book."
4,Like Stepping Into a Vermeer Painting,"This book is written in a soft and subtle style, at the same time with a richness and acuity that let me walk in the world of Delft in Vermeer's time. I felt like I could see the painting from the inside out. The writer's style was congruent with the feeling of Vermeer's art -clear, beautiful, detailed.The story-line focuses on a young woman hired as a maid for the Vermeer family. He decides to paint her. The novel then fictionalizes the history behind Vermeer's great painting, 'The Girl wth the Pearl Earring;."
5,suprisingly good,"I started to read it and could not put it down.Some authors will spend pages describing a scene or a person, making a book drag out. This author, with a few words, made you feel like you where standing next to the character."
2,Lowered Expectations,"The story-line is engaging enough, but I was unimpressed with Tracy's handling of historical material and prose style. This was simply not very well written."
4,A Look Behind the Canvas,"Rather than discussing the techniques of Vermeer this book portrayed what Dutch life was like during Vermeer's life. I found it an interesting and refreshing way to introduce the times and circumstances for that particular period, with a good description of how paint colors were mixed as well as some insight into how Vermeer may have actually worked when he was creating. All in all, a delight to read."
4,Girl with a Pearl Earring,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As I initially read the reviews I was skeptical, but the title kept coming up on the list of books I might enjoy. They were right. The title character tells the story from her point of view and you can't help but be captivated by her story."
4,quiet elegance,"This is a beautifully told story. It explores the complications and private motivations in the heart and home of the painter Vermeer. We are privy to the interior world of the artist through the eyes of a young maid. Her relationship with the painter and his capacity to ""see"" her and the world around him are a fascinating study in human perception. He uses a box to transpose the image of the girl and to allow him to experience the world in a different way and thereby paint with a different vision. The family around him is turning upside down while he hides under the cover of the black box. The placement of this gentle story on the best seller list is a reaffirmation of humanity's need for mystery. The slow revelation of the characters to the reader mirrors the experience of visually absorbing a great work of art. We stand and stare until we see what we perceive to be the true message behind the painting."
3,not worth reading for what it claims to be,"I didn't like the writer's style at all--she tries to make every word very colorful and to play with your imagination and does it very poorly: every sentence is a hoard of images and a poor blend, too. She would say something like this: ""her eyes were as blue as a sky in the mid afternoon,when the rain has just ended and the little pink and white clouds are running by like young horses."" (I'm exagerrating,but you get the idea).You do get some feeling from this book about the life in Delft in Vermeer's times but the story fails to give you any idea about where the artist drew his inspiration. Everything revolves around this fiction character of a girl and it doesn't build characters ---everyone in the book is either good or bad."
2,Vermeer Lite,"Not bad, if you want to spend the time of a (short) airplane trip and you can't fly with knitting needles anymore, but really! A servant girl who can tell what is missing from an unfinished portrait -- who knows better than Vermeer what one touch is needed to make a portrait whole? Forget this, forget ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"", and find ""The Flanders Panel""."
3,A great property for Merchant Ivory ...,"but a little thin for a novel. I've heard people rave about this book, and it is a charming little story, quite lovingly written. I understand why some readers have responded so enthusiastically to this and the spate of other novels that have come out recently that involve Dutch painters. Others are ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"" about a fictional Vermeer painting, ""Johanna"", about the widow of Van Gogh's brother and even ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" which includes a character referred to as 'the Master' (really the best of the bunch). It seems a little mean-spirited to criticize this book too harshly because I enjoyed it too, but the story is small, and the characters' concerns are uber-domestic. Even the writing is simplistic, verging on Hemingwayesque, not a plus. I'd give it a B-, and since somebody has probably already optioned the rights to it, I recommend waiting for the movie."
4,Very Satisfying,"This was one of the most satisfying and imaginative novels I have read in quite some time. While probably not a ""classic,"" it is certainly a book that I'll remember and think about for some time to come. I found myself surfing the web for sites containing pictures of Vermeer's paintings while I was reading Chevalier's fictionalized account of how they came to life. The author has a great eye for the sometimes mundane details of day-to-day life and her dialogue is sparkling. This is one book that is well worth reading!"
3,"Easy, Entertaining Read","I'm not a fast reader by any means. But I managed to tear through this book in 3 days, hour-and-a-half sittings at a time(fast for me, anyway). I first dismissed this book as a period piece. It is, but Chevalier keeps the plot fast-paced and doesn't bog the story down with detail. At the core is the story of a Dutch maid and her working and semi-seunsual relationship with the painter Vermeer. Not quite as multi-layered as I like from a novel, I was very entertained and had a hard time putting it down. ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" would be a good start for any book club. And if you're looking for an excellent follow-up book about a passionate artist try Chaim Potok's ""My Name is Asher Lev."""
4,a reader from ca,"Well, as far as I'm concerned, I thought this book was interesting as well as facinating. I first came here to amazon.com to find a book for my new class book report. I asked for historical fiction and a handfull of books popped up. Only, this was the one that caught my eye. I read a couple of reviews and the excerpt and decided to try it out. Now, I'm not the kind of person who would read a historical fiction but this one was great. I found it interesting, not boreing at all. It was very mezmerizing and I could never put it down. I finished in a week and told all my friends about it. They too were hooked."
4,History /bling,Our Read n share book club recently read this book with mixed reviews. I like history presented in a novel. It showed many facets of life in the 17th century in a country that was in its golden age.
2,Lacking in detail and character development,"I found this book to be too short, lacking in character development and excitement of any kind. I am someone who prefers long books that take you through time, that paint a thorough picture of the main characters. I did not get this from Girl with a Pearl Earring. I was very disappointed."
4,An Amazing Read,I was captivated by this novel. I could feel myself being transported in the life of the girl with the pearl earring. I wasn't able to put the book down!
3,Pretty story but pretty simple too....,"I picked this up as I have become interested in historical fiction; it is my first Chevalier novel. I thought the writing was pretty; it pulled me into the time period. However, the story was simple and seemed a little overplayed. The book was full of the maid's daily chores and understated infatuation with her master.There is nothing wrong with book it just will not be a challenging read."
3,No BookMark Required,"""Now that the painting was finished he no longer wanted me.""I read this book in one sitting and you will too (if you've got the time).The story is about a young woman who has to take on a job as a maid in the house of a wealthy painter to support her blind father and her mother.In her new master's house, her master has an interest in her that drives his wife's jealousy into several fits, the older maid into calling her a whore, and her master's daughter into pulling mischevious pranks that more than once almost get her fired.Even if you don't read this book in one setting, thoughts of Griet and her misfortunes will haunt the back of your mind until you've finished."
2,A lot of hype for nothing,"I was really excited to get this book and read it. I started it right away and was promptly dissapointed. This book is BORING! I am suprised I stayed awake long enough to finsh it. I don't know were everyone is getting all this stuff about this book being great. I did not see the point of this book. In one word, yuck."
3,Simple Seduction,"Girl with a Pearl is a lovely one evening read. A nice break in between the conspiracy theory novels. Don't rush this book, it ends much too soon. Interesting relationship dynamics. Purchase from a used book store, or you may want some of your money back."
5,A new twist on a historical event,"Griet, the fictional character on which Chevalier bases her novel is a likable, relatable teenage girl. Chevalier's idea for her book is a creative one, inventing a fake muse for a real painting. She mixes fiction with fact in such a tantalizing way that she makes this book and Griet seem real. Her vivid descriptions of Holland give the reader a feel for what it was really like during Vermeer's time period. For readers who like historical fiction, this is a good book to read."
5,INVENTING A LIFE,"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I was quite impressed by Tracy Chevalier's novel GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. Using the famous Vermeer painting as a launch pad, Ms. Chevalier invents a life for the historically unknown subject of this portrait. Along the way, she provides convincing character portraits for Griet, Vermeer, and numerous other people encircling their lives. Ms. Chevalier also captures the essence of their time and creates a realistic setting for her novel. Great book. Read it soon."
3,Girl with a Pearl Earring,"The book does read quickly as many readers have noted, perhaps a bit too quickly. By contrast, Vermeer's paintings take time... years. They can be ""re-read"" thousands of times with no risk of tiring. It will be very interesting to see which aspect of the book the upcoming film will emphasize. Just in case someone is interested, there is an informative website devoted entirely to the real painting..."
4,Charming if Unchallenging Read,"As has been noted by other reviewers, this is not a book that is going to be well-loved by scholars of Vermeer. It is purely a fictional tale. But it is a quite delightful fictional tale that I found to be a very pleasant and quite interesting read. It is the story of an impoverished girl who is sent to be a lowly maid in the Vermeer household in the mid 1600s. Her interaction with the master, whilst quite innocent, is a catalyst for suspicion and jealousy amongst other members of the household, both above and below stairs. Much of her time is spent treading carefully as rumours of her relationship with Vermeer spread throughout the house and the entire town. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am sure others will too so long as they don't try to make it into anything more serious."
2,Make It Stop!,"How on earth did this book become a bestseller? Flat, one-dimensional characters, no plot, strained metaphors . . . Griet doesn't have any redeeming qualities. She's unkind to her family, snotty with a working-class man because his hands are dirty, and in love with a man who treats her like dirt, willing to jam an earring into an infected ear so the painting will be ""right."" We're supposed to root for these two? The whole thing was disappointing and the ending cliche."
5,Absolutely Radiant,"This was a vivid and beautifully written tale that immerses you in the life of 17th century Delft. The well imagined story of the Girl With a Pearl Earring painted by Vermeer had me captivated from the very first page. The sense of tension grew page by, incident by incident. I came to feel so much sympathy for the main character Griet, the young maid. Although the ending was not what I would have wished, it was perfectly suited to the storyline, with a satisfactory conclusion. I found myself looking up Vermeer paintings, to compare them to those described in the book. It was fun to read the author's depictions of the stories behind the paintings. A very enjoyable read."
2,Missed opportunity,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is a pale rendition of the life of a simpleton maid in 17th Century Holland. It is a linear slice that offers little insight in the trials and tedium of tending to a struggling artist's household and studio.You will not explore the rich values of class distinction, religious casts, beoming of age, respect or creative genius. While these elements are present, they are reduced to clichés and left to the reader to surmise.Chevalier's syntax and rhythm did not lend itself to the images, fears and angst that she was ushering us through.Chevalier is narrating from a safe and comfortable position, she never managed to transcend her main character.I am baffled that the book enjoyed such a wide following."
3,Waiting for something important to happen,"The book is very well written. However, I went through the entire book waiting for something to happen. While most of the characters were very well developed, the character of the artist was not. I was hoping to get a better understanding of his position and feelings, but nothing. I actually felt the book was pretty boring. I am enjoying the Girl in Hyancith Blue much more."
4,As if a painting grew arms to write with,"Okay...I'm not quite finished with this novel, but so far I can appreciate the intent of the author, which is to apply to literature the style of Jan Vermeer's paintings. The story is very simplistic, very unlike Memoirs of a Geisha. The plot is almost non-existant. But what makes this novel worth reading is that you can peer into another place and another time. The author also creates a very forthright, believable protagonist. As someone who was raised Catholic, I'm also intrigued by that crucifixion painting in the bedroom."
3,Art Comes to Life,"Begin with the haunting painting by Vermeer, add to that an imagined tale of how the painting came to be and you have Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier. The story begins with a basic plot line of poor girl who must stoop to a lower station in life, but with rich detail of the times to flesh out the story, the tale unwinds in a fascinating way. As the reader slips through the first-person narrative, the home where the poor girl lives comes alive with characters who if not unique, are distinctly drawn and easily imagined in the reader's imagination. Although the story bogs down into all too expected developments in the middle of the book, hang on. The end of the story is worth the reader's while to learn how and why the painting might have come to pass. And the multi-faceted meaning of a pearl earring."
2,Not so great book that made for a pretty good movie,"Did you ever watch a movie and know that if you could see round the corner of the set you would see cardboard details and wood supports holding the facade up? This book feels like that. You constantly hear the author's voice rather than the character's and it feels like the author is pushing these cardboard characters around her plot in a forced and obvious way. I was left with a feeling of ""Where's the beef?"".That said, it was very easy to read and it did make a pretty good movie."
1,GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING,What a loser! The most boring book I have ever read. The story is trite. The characters are totally forgettable.
2,"A Bland, Colorless Encounter with Vermeer","Chevalier has painted Vermeer's world, but has forgotten to make it interesting. We enter Vermeer's world through the first-person narrative of Griet, a young sixteen-year old maid. In typical Cinderalla-like fashion, Griet is hated by Vermeer's wife and daughter, Cornelia. Griet, pious and beautiful, maintains her place in the home, gaining the attentions of the male characters.Chevalier tells rather than shows, breaking the first rule of good writing. In addition, her prose is amateurish: simplistic and syntactically dull. Perhaps Chevalier should have spent less time including as many socio-historical tidbits as possible and focused on developing the characters . . . . and the plot."
3,"Good, but didn't bring the time to life",I enjoyed this novel in many ways. The story was moving and enchanting. But I had the feeling that the author had never visited the place that she wrote about. The sights and smells of this time just didn't come to life for me on the page.
3,Maybe I expected too much,"I finished it, which says something, but I know I won't read it again. I liked the deluxe edition, and I enjoyed the full-color plates."
5,Excellent and the Best Chevalier Novel,If you have read Tracy Chevalier before then start with this novel. It is her best work. The Virgin Blue is good but not as good as this book is. Wow - creating a whole story out of just looking at a painting. I can imagine how Tracy's kids bedtime stories must be - amazing is what I am thinking. Tell me a story mom and then here comes this elaborate tale.
4,Good but not enough,"I bought this book after catching a few words on the biograghy of this famouse painter Vermeer. I wanted to learn more on this whole pearl earring thing. This book was so good I didnt want to finish it and that is why I give it a 4 out of 5. It ended too quickly as if the author gave up or ran out of ideas. It was a good read, but not enough to make me happy."
3,YOU KNOW THE STORY,"Young pretty girl forced to toll unmercifully as a maid to support her destitute family in the home of a brooding artist. There's the jealous wife, bossy mother in law, nasty servants, lots of bratty kids, lecherous art patron, a little dilly dally with the butcher boy. This book was not as dark as some of the works of Vermeer and the writing extremely well done. Except for the little twist at the end, predictable but enjoyable to read."
4,A richly painted novel,"The reader will find themselves drawn into this finely spun story, richly lavished on pages you can't help but turn quickly.I appreciated the main character keeping her dignity, and the book not turning into another good-girl-gone-wrong story. Bravo!More!"
4,A creative story of dreams held at bay.,"The year is 1664 and 16 year-old Griet is sent to work as a maid in the Vermeer household where she is scorned by some and tolerated by others. A wonderful portrayal of life in the times of the famous Dutch artist as witnessed from the eyes of a young girl mesmerized by a greatness beyond her reach.Though the author does not paint Vermeer in a very favorable light, he clearly portrays the egocentric expectations of a great master who is solely wrapped up in his work. The characters are interesting and the story flows well to an ending that is to be expected. It is the glimpse at human nature and the creative process of this great artist that is so enjoyable. That and a young girls love and respect for her master. A wonderful book. Kelsana 4/04/01"
1,A Too Perfect Girl,"Although I was quite anxious to get my hands on this book, I must admit I came away disappointed. For me, Griet's perfection rendered her unbelievable. All men found her irresistably attractive; she worked very hard with no resentment and knew every trick doing whatever task she approached perfectly -- her wash was the whitest; she was an ace at bartering for the best cuts of meat; she intuitively understood the psyches of those who surrounded her; she ground the purest colors, and even knew better than Vermeer what a painting needed. It was just too much! Though I very much appreciate the inspiration for this book and the depiction of Delft in the time of Vermeer, his portrait depicts a girl with profound humanity, not the angel genius described in this book."
4,"Very nice little book, this.","Tracy Chevalier, Girl with a Pearl Earring (Dutton, 1999)To date, I've read only one bad review of this slight novel, and a whole lot of excellent ones. I'm casting my vote on the excellent side. Chevalier took one of Vermeer's best-known and most enigmatic paintings and built a story around it (there are a series of these novels; Joyce Carol Oates' I Lock My Door Upon Myself is the only other one I've read, and it is similarly excellent). Griet, a sixteen-year-old from the Protestant side of the tracks, becomes the maidservant of the Vermeers after a kiln accident forces her father out of a job, and the story alternately skips between the variouis tensions within the Vermeer household and Griet's courting by a somewhat ham-handed, if well-meaning, butcher. It's subject matter that could have (and has) been screwed up in too many ways to imagine, but Chevalier pulls it off by keeping the prose spare and letting the silences speak most of the necessary lines. ****"
3,How a poor little Dutch girl got to wear earrings.,"This book is interesting from an historical point of view -- for anyone who loves history, art or Hans Brinker stories, but it doesn't quite sustain the reader's interest. The story tends to drag a bit."
3,Chavalier Paints a Pretty Picture,"If you like the sort of book that paints a picture of days gone by, then this book is for you. If you like the sort of book that is more concerned with plot than atmosphere, then you might want to consider something else.While I found the ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" to be an enjoyable read, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of character development. Whereas Vermeer's paintings convey a dimensionality beyond the painted surface, Chevalier's book does not convey anything beyond a pretty picture.I did enjoy the book, and I would recommend it as a good book to promote interest in an entry-level art history class or as a short summer read."
2,who are these people anyway,"I was greatly looking forward to this book until I started reading it. It was well written, but there was no meat in it. The first half of the book seemed to be about the fine points of being a maid in a household of dysfunctional adults and children. I kept waiting for something to happen other than doing laundry and going to market. The author never developed the characters beyond a purely surface level making it difficult to care about their lives or who they were, which by the way, was never explored. A small interest at the end when the painting was being done, but there was never was any insight into the painter Vermeer's personality. I read ""The Girl in Hyacinth Blue."" A far superior book about the same subject."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I heard well-read friends rave about this book, and I finally got around to reading it. Sheesh...It's nothing but a feather-weight, romance novel type tale of archetypal characters! We already know the cast: The illiterate but wise yet plucky housemaid, the silent and enigmatic lord of the household, the shrewish wife, the jealous co-worker. <yawn> Aside from nice language that describes the painting technique, there's no there there. Maybe it works for people who don't read much? I felt let-down."
5,Book,"I bought this book for school because I had a class the required it. That's about it, Three more words required...hah"
4,"Creative, and fascinating",I enjoy reading books that have a historical context to them and bring you into the worlds of the past. I enjoyed the way a painting by Vemeer was interpreted to create such an intricate story. One of the best reads of 2002.
3,Interesting but not compelling.,"While I this book is well written and enjoyable, the story is not particularly compelling and the characters lack something. It provides an interesting picture of a young girl in Holland, but little else. Certainly not a page turner, but a solid and capable novel."
4,A lovely story!,"I have long admired Vermeer's paintings and in particular, this one. I picked up this book on a whim as I do not often read fiction. Tracey Chevalier is a talented and graceful writer. Her recreation of Dutch life is extremely detailed, yet presented simply. Some might find this book too subtle, but I thought it perfect. I read it slowly, all in one sitting and found that the emotions so many of us are addicted to these days were all underlying. They are never blatant, yet when Griet hurts, so does the reader. Highly recommended and a easy enough read for younger people!"
3,Mixed Impressions,"I expected this to be my favorite Tracy Chevalier book and was very surprised to discover it wasn't. The main issue I had with the book was with the characters. I don't mind if a character has contradictions, in fact, I like it. But I need to have an explaination for actions that are out of character. If I don't understand the character's motivations I feel that I don't know them very well, making it difficult to relate to them. There were a lot of things I enjoyed about the ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"". As usual, Chevalier makes the atmosphere come to life in a way that few can. You feel as if you have really stepped back in time to mid 17th century Delft. The storyline, involving Vermeer's relationship with a young housemaid is very interesting and compelling. I recommend this book to fans of Tracy Chevalier.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
5,Just Marvelous,"I want to read more by Tracy Chevalier. She did a wonderful job of getting inside the character Griet's head, and her descriptions truly brought the art studio of Vermeer to life. I know little about art, yet was fascinated by the layering of paint and the use of light, and have this urge to visit an art museum. When Chevalier was portraying Griet's sitting for the painting ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring,"" I couldn't help flipping from the printed page to the cover, back and forth. Just marvelous!"
4,very enjoyable,"If you enjoy historical fiction, or fictionalized biographies, you will enjoy this book. It's a short, quick read, very engaging, really because of the insight it gives into Vermeer's working style and technique. This book will inspire me to read a biography of Vermeer. I also look forward to reading more books by this author."
4,4.5***The story behind the painting...,"""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" tells the story behind the relationship between Vermeer and his subject, his maid-the girl Griet. Like the painting, the story is simple, subtle and strangely intimate.Upon picking up Chevalier's novel, I thought it might be slow and boring. Thankfully, despite the delicate prose, the novel moves along at a steady pace and at times the novel is so silent and intense-like a cat on the hunt- I had to hold my breath. The novel is the perfect length and Chevalier skillfully mixes character, art, plot and 17th century Holland into a tight novel."
4,A fairly good book,"I enjoyed this book. I liked its simplicity and its careful details. The storyline is somewhat thin but somehow it manages to propel the reader along. I enjoyed seeking out and looking at the paintings that are referenced in the story, the author certainly managed to shed new light on them.I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks a quick, absorbing read."
3,A easy read,"I took the e-book with me to Holland when I went this fall, and I thought it evoked the lives of people in the 17th century when Vermeer painted. In Delft, I could imagine this girl in the streets, running her errands, making out with the butcher's son, visiting her family, etc. But I wish I'd gone to the Hague and seen the painting."
5,Good read,This book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. I ordered this book for our book club read and would recommend it to other book clubs.
5,Read - visit Delft - read again,"I read this book right after I visited Delft and walked the same streets, visited the Delft Ceramic factory right on the outskirts of this lovely town, stood at the spot that Vermeer stood when he painted his view of Delft. I spent lovely hours at the Vermeer museum established on the site of the Guild he led, studying copies of the 39 known paintings he left. (And no originals remain in Delft).This little book gives a plausible account of what might be a possible back-story of his beautiful painting - Girl with a Pear Earring, and I found it totally enjoyable.Highly recommendedwith the caveat on the next reader walking those beautiful streets of this historic Netherlandish town."
5,Captivating,"The film was recommended to me a year ago and I put it off wanting to read the book first.It's such a simple story but so deep at the same time. The characters are all so real, I could imagine every single one of them. Griet was a wonderful character, moral and innocent yet with a growing worldliness as she realised how her life was panning out.The historical information was really interesting, especially from a maids viewpoint...but the art aspect was just as fascinating. Most of all though Chevalier is a good watcher of people and although set in 1665 the characters feelings show that nothing really changes. She captures Griets vulnerability and pride perfectly.Endings of novels are often a let down but this one wasn't. I'll never be able to look at pictures of this painting again without imagining Griet."
4,This book got me hooked on Chevalier's novels,"I read the book after seeing the movie and I truly believe that in order to understand the story you need to read the book. This story is so good because it has details and nuances that you only get from the book. Chevalier made me care about her leading lady, Griet. I felt for her and her hard life full of sadness. The book even made me feel downhearted after reading it, but I still enjoyed it. This is the book that led me to find out more about Vermeer and Chevalier and to check out more of her books in the library."
5,A wonderful book-a quick and delightful read,"What a lovely story surrounded by the story of the painter Vermeer and his enchanting Dutch ""Mona Lisa"". I found this story particularly enjoyable because of my love of all things Dutch. The author is able to perfectly blend a lovely fictional character coming-of-age with factual history from the life and town of Johannes Vermeer. The author did an amazing job exploring the rift between the catholics and protestants within the community.Also, see the movie after you read the book...Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson portray Vermeer and Griet well, and the scenery of Delft, Netherlands is breathtaking."
3,A Let Down Ending,"I did enjoy Girl with a Pearl Earing. I thought the characters were well written and true to life. However, if you were looking for a story of scandal (a painter having an affair with his young maid) you won't find it. This is that classic tale of first love, one-way-street love, and love that can never be. It's a story about settling for second best, being trapped by your class, and the grass-is-always-greener feeling. Though the Girl in question has a strong backbone, she too suffers from the imobilization that love, lust, and infatuation give us.I did enjoy reading the book, but the hype and descriptions written about it mislead my expectations."
5,Girl With a Pearl Earring,"I enjoyed this book so much! As I read, I was totally engrossed, and I remember that during the process I paused, and tried to analyze just what it was that engrossed me so. The story itself is so simple, but it's a great story, nonetheless. The author's characterization is so much fun. I discovered many dimensions to most of the main characters. You'll love Catharina! The author's mention of several of Vermeer's masterpieces is an added bonus. When my reading session was completed I felt I had discovered some interesting connections to Vermeer's paintings. I later discovered that my mental images were quite different from the examples of the actual work! It was just a really interesting, fun, artsy, quick read. It doesn't get any better than that!"
5,Chevalier's tour de force on Vermeer's life and loves,"This book has quickly risen to my top 5 favorite books of all time. It takes a lot of brilliance and entertainment to sit alongside George Orwell, and Chevalier delivers. The 17th century Dutch landscape is described with as much depth and attention to detail as its most famous artist. The novel's protagonist and Vermeer's muse is the enigmatic girl from the painting, ""Girl with a pearl earring"". Chevalier masterfully blends art history and fiction to make this a delicious read. Chevalier's greatest gift lies in her ability to literally flood the reader's senses. I can still feel the thick smoothness of home-made colors between my fingers, and the warmth of the sun on my face from the windows of a solitary studio."
1,Oh My GOD what a waste of time.,"I had the cd version (trying to help pass the time on an ugly commute) and I have to admit the beginning intrigued me. I thought the writing was a little silly; the attempts at being profound in it's descriptives were a little ridiculous, but the storyline did indeed pull me in.And then it just kept going and going and going and never went anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen. I waited....and waited.... and waited. Nothing.Then it ended. I was pretty irritated, to be honest. I'm glad I borrowed the thing from the library and didn't spend any money.Such a brilliant concept that was wasted by a very poor writer."
3,Moderately impressive,"A fictionalized account of the story behind the girl with a pearl earring in Vermeer's painting. By the end, I found it satisfying, but much of the beginning and middle seemed forced to me. In trying to put in the details of 17th century life in Holland, I found myself imagining the author with her history books more than I imagined a deep picture of average life. Not a book I'd highly recommend, but still moderatly impressive for its creativity."
1,don't judge a book by its cover,"I know many people like this book so I just want to address those potential readers who might think this is a literary read. It's not. There is no depth of character, no attempt to describe what life would have been like in the 17th century for a girl like this, virtually nothing about the Holland of Vermeer's time, to the point where it is clear this was never the concern of the author. Just a nice, simple romance novel dressed up in a upmarket dust jacket. Like another reviewer said, it will make a sumptuous Merchant Ivory film, and that will probably improve it. That cover is very deceptive; there's nothing to ""look at"" as you read, just the thoughts of a nice girl thinking about love in what could easily be translated to a wealthy bohemian artists' community in suburban America."
4,Griet smolders...,"...in the presence of her master, Vermeer. Beautifully done. As rich, sweet, layered, and unsentimental as the master's masterpieces themselves. So, Colin Firth will play Vermeer? Smoldering, indeed. Anyone know who has written, or is writing, the screenplay?"
2,Boring,"After all the great reviews of this book, perhaps I had unrealistic expectations...I read this book quickly, hoping that something, anything, exciting would happen. Ultimately, I was disappointed.Throughout the book it seems as though the author is trying to build the readers anticipation for an ultimate shocking scene, a scene which never materializes. I will give the author credit for building great characters; characters that you can truly like and dislike with good reason. The characters were believable, but the plot was just not there. My advice? Borrow it from a friend or the library, but don't spend your money..."
3,Sweet 'n' Low for the mind,"I picked up this book on request from my godmother, and read it over two or three days. Although not bad, it's not extremely memorable either.This book imagines the story of the anonymous Girl With A Pearl Earring in Vermeer's famous painting of the same name. In the book, the girl is Griet, a newly hired maid in Vermeer's household. Griet is a well-drawn, sympathetic character whose emotions are clearly defined. Her struggles between Vermeer and Pieter, the butcher's son, as well as her more subsumed longing for a better and higher life, are easy to relate to. However, this book does not delve into the many layers of human emotion within Vermeer. Although probably written in partial to demonstrate his enigmatical existence, it is a bit of a letdown.Overall, this is a nice, simple book that does not require you to think; it merely requires you to lose yourself in 17th-century Holland for a few days."
3,delightful,"When I see a portrait, I always wonder ""why her ? "" and ""why in this way?"" Chevalier's novel is just that, a delightful look into those questions, and into life in Vermeer's time. I think that artists mostly work for themselves, not for other artists, and it is fair to assume - if only for the sake of a good story - that Vermeer maybe thought about his cleaning girl more than what he would like to admit to his wife. Don't we all do this kind of thing ? Don't we all sometimes get good ideas from the strangest sources ?"
2,high school fiction,"I was embarrassed on behalf of Vermeer while reading this book. Definitely aimed at high-school level readers, who may be interested in the pseudo romance and ""artist as a flawed regular man"" approach. Chevalier's first novel, recently published, suffers from the same sophomoric skill level and just plain goofy storyline."
5,Better than the movie,"The book is a whole lot better than the movie...If you have seen the movie , please get the book...There's a ton of difference..."
4,What an enjoyable story,"What an enjoyable story about the artist Vermeer from a young girl's viewpoint. Tracy Chevalier's novel was such a pleasantly surprising adaptation of what might have happened between an artist and his muse. I added this book to my list of recommendations, especially for teen readers."
5,A wonderfully terrible book,"I just finished the book this morning after reading much of the night. My own process connected perfectly with the empathy of the characters, their blights, dreams, fears, and the resoltion of what happened to them. That empathy hit me in a place where I wept for myself and the characters of the book."
3,Entering Vermeer's World,"The great strength of the novel for me was the painstaking recreation of Vemeer's household and his method of working. (I must go and look at some of his paintings again!) It's an undemanding and fairly enjoyable read, although I found the characterisation thin and the plot slow moving at times. The domestic details become tedious after a while, and there is a real lack of dramatic tension in the novel, even in the scenes between Vermeer and Griet. I wonder if we would feel so much for Griet without Vermeer's wonderful painting on the cover of the book? Perhaps the book would appeal much more to young readers."
4,Transported,"This book was as beautiful and as realistic as Vermeer's paintings. I not only pictured Griet and her daily life, I felt her emotions, especially the longing she had for her employer. Although I think Griet's ultimate destiny was predictable early in the story, I still felt the book conveyed a sense of what it was like to be a young woman in those times. I could not help but believe that Vermeer's desire for Griet was the reason his wife kept getting pregnant! The unfulfilled passion between Griet and Vermeer was so much more effective a means than having them yield to what both felt. Tracy Chevalier has written a brilliant account of love that eventually is requited, but not in the way a reader might assume it would be."
4,Delicious!,"I truly enjoyed this book. The story is not what I expected at all. The view from maid Griet's station in life brings out colors, drama and a rich sensuality I did not expect. Living and learning from a master is a rare priveledge. The story is simple /dramatic and exciting. I couldn't put it down. I so loved Griet's awakening to color and all the revelations that come with that...learning how to see.There are some very interesting characters. The book is meticulous and well researched. But you don't feel that while reading because the author is a truly wonderful story teller.Enjoy!"
5,A beautiful story,"Girl with a pearl earring is the most beautiful story I've read. It tells a story of a dutch girl, griet, caught between many things. As you read you notice she has no control over life and how everythings being planned for her. She continues this way through the whole book. Only person she probably had true enough feeling for was the painter, her master. And fyi, this book isnt detailed on sex scences because its not meant to be. ENJOY"
1,rubbish product,Please Please Please do not buy this cheap CAT5 cable. Plugs broke down in a week. I asked them to send another one. But result was the same..
5,Doug Stones Greatest Hits,"One of my favorite of the more ""traditional"" male country vocalists, this cd will take ya back to when country was still country! Not like this fluff of today right? lol This Cd was exactly as described and came very quickly. With many great hits like ""Warning Labels,"" ""Come In Out Of the Pain,"", Don't be ""Too Busy Being In Love"" and miss this wonderful collection, or you'll be left wondering ""Why didn't I Think Of That?"""
3,"Should be named ""Some of his Hits""","When will the record companies do the right thing and make a cd with all the great songs on it? I will gladly pay more for more songs. I just hate having to buy two ""greatest Hits"" or ""Super Hits"" to get all the sogs that I want when there are duplicate songs on them. The cd itself is great..all the songs are worth listening to, but again, these are just ""some"" of his hits."
4,Daddy's Love,Shifting Through Neutral is a great story about the love between a father and his daughter. This story will capture your heart until the very end. So Take The Ride you will enjoy the read.
2,Serious read...,Rae Rae was an extraordinary strong child. She dreamed of love from a mother that would not give it to her for whatever reasons. The love for her father was profound and like no other. This book has a serious tone - but yet sensitive and a calm read.Reviewer: SC
4,A twist you cant miss,"This not so well written 'romantic suspense' was still, at the end, worth reading. Set in Victorian England, a young lady has gotten a job as a governess. On her way to the new post, a mysterious man appears and leads her and her driver safely across the waters to the other side. Who this man is and why he is feared by her employers makes an interesting though slow read. I keep recommending it to people just for the sake of seeing whether they were as surprised by the twist at the end as I was."
4,Not their best,"Of course, If 1 is the best, with every song a unique arrangement, that no one has ever duplicated. They really were reaching out on all sides. Unless you have one hundred bucks to shell out, buy Forgotten Roads, their Best of, and Live in Europe '72. The latter lost in the vaults, and was released way after the sixties/seventies cusp of truly progressive rock, with Soft Machine, Family, Coryell, Genesis, Crimson, etc. yet to stagnate. If was not a jazz-rock group, they were THE jazz-rock group, with most other group just main stream rock with horn riff enriched stuff. If, on the other hand, wrote solid numbers that could stand on their own without vocals, and the singer is one more powerful sax voicing. Who can describe If? Buy it to appreciate it, and play it LOUD. Also, only half of their album Waterfall contains the original inspired lineup"
5,Tactical Pistol Shooting,"A very thorough and well thought-out guide. Clear illustrations (photos) showing the proper techniques. Some books have very grainy black and white photos that make it hard to discern what proper technique looks like. This one has very clear color photos that leave no doubt. The text and page layout make it very easy to read, versus other books cramming tiny text onto the page. I also like the way the author broke down the elements of good shooting. Erik Lawrence did a fantastic job! Definitely a buy if your career requires firearm (pistol) skills."
4,Good information without being wordy and opinionated.,"This is a good overview for both novice and experienced shooters. It is informative without being wordy and opinionated. While a lot of the concepts were not new to me, I did learn something new and useful. In my book, that means it was worth the purchase price."
4,Good Basics,"it's a good book for learning basic shooting tactics. after you read this book, you'll have to go to the range and try some things out for yourself. i recommended for anyone trying to sharpen their shooting skills."
5,Great Book,"As a firearms instructor, it is refreshing to finally read a well written book on Tactical shooting. I enjoyed the book so much, that I recommend it to my students."
5,Top 3 of all books on tactical shooting,"As a federal agent and a prior police officer, I loved this book. It is concise, well illustrated, and straight to the point. If you can only read one book, and you need to learn tactics and techniques that could save your life, this is it. This author puts out a good book, and I just wish I could train with him. The only negative, it should have been longer so that it would have more time to read. The people he list as reading and critiquing the book are real world players who have tested this stuff in combat, especially Tom Wilburn. Soldiers, police officers, and civilians will learn an effective way to protect their lives."
5,Tactical Pistol Shooting 'Your Guide to Tactics that work',What saves lives in a gun fight is doing the basics well. This is one of the best books out there for teach the basics. Excellent pictures and easy to understand discriptions makes this book great for all levels of marksman. If your getting into pistol shooting or want to learn how tactical teams shoot this is a must have.
5,The only pistol shooting book you need.,"Its pretty simple...there is only one pistol shooting book you need and this is it. Hands down the best i have read. Pictures are detailed and excellent quality. The books is written in a clear and concise manner that is easy to follow. Its not filled with ""cool"" tactical ninja crap. Everything in this book is functional and will make you a better shooter."
4,Tactical pistol shooting,Very helpful. Good basic skills. Easy to understand and pictures are very helpful. Will continue to get more books on this subject.
1,Lot's of bad advice,"This book is full of bad advice, such as using the slide stop as a slide release. The slide stop is a small piece of metal that can break, and it doesn't cause the slide to fully retract which means the gun may not go into battery. Bottom line, you really need to know your stuff if you are going to read this book so you can sort of the good from the bad. Not for beginners!"
4,Fundamentals,"Disclaimer: this is the only book of this kind that I've read, so my basis for comparison is limited.Great fundamental presented by a guy who has been there. There are lots of guys who teach, but not so many that have actually been in real combat situations with real people shooting back. That makes all the difference to me.The photos are excellent and there are lots of them. Photos are much more effective than excessive narrative when teaching technique (i.e. how to hold the pistol, body alignment, etc). I'm learning a lot from the book. I might prefer more of an emphasis on basic shooting fundamentals vs. techniques covering, for example, shooting weak-handed while wounded, but maybe that's not the intended scope this book. But don't get me wrong, the fundamentals are covered.I definitely recommend the book and I'm glad I bought it. I'd do it again."
3,Very Basic.,"This one is probably a good starting point for someone who is only beginning to learn about tactical pistol shooting. However, given the fact that same information is readily available for free from the Internet (i.e. YouTube has plenty of videos dedicated to just about every section of this book), I'd pass on this one..."
2,"A little disappointed, not enough room","While this is a great looking bag and it looks exactly like the picture, it doesn't prove to be what I wanted in a bowling bag. I needed to transfer an indented styrofoam ball holder into the bag so that the ball would not roll around. This bag is for my disabled 20 year old daughter who wears a size 4 shoe and the only place to store them is on top of the ball. (not nice) The side pockets and front pockets are too small for her size 4 shoes. We use it still as it does roll well but it isn't the best BOWLING rolling bag."
5,I love the short story about Torin,"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons. These books are always wonderful, well written, and perfectly characterized. All of her series are great but the ones that take place on Pern are the best of all."
2,Wish I hadn't started here,"I've heard alot of good things about the Pern series - so I figured I'd start with this book which chronicles some of the history and founding of Pern and of Benden Weyr. Dissapointingly, the stories of Benden Weyr and Ruatha Hold were the only ones I found interesting (the dolphin story I couldn't even manage to make myself read.) I haven't lost my faith in this series yet though - I plan to start at the beginning where I should have in the first place. If you're new to Pern don't start with this book! Only for serious Pern addicts who are interested in the history."
2,True fans should avoid it,"`Okay, let's get one thing straight: I lived and breathed Pern for a great deal of my life. I have to recommend that all fans look long and hard at the slew of latter day Pern books, though, and consider making the hard decision to skip them. This is just such a book -- along with the incredibly disappointing book that showed the ""first founders"" of Pern and all the lame origins for things like the grubs, the dragons, the name of the holds, and so on, it only serves to rob the series of the`` wonder of the Ancients. I couldn't enjoy this book at all, I'm sorry to say -- the deep exploration of the homosexuality of Blue riders didn't help any. No, for my money, Pern fans should stick with the first three books, the Harper hall series (Pemur and Menolly), and All the Weyrs of Pern. Whatever you do, skip the lame books like Renegades of Pern (shudder) and this one.`"
2,Didn't get cover on my Kindle,"I was very disappointed that I didn't get the cover image for this book on my Kindle. What image I received is not the same as the one presented on the product page. I enjoy the cover image just as much as the book, since the book is not really complete without the cover image, but not having the cover image dampened my experience. I'm very disappointed that the publisher didn't felt the cover image was necessary as this is a digital copy of the book, but yet charged the full price as if I purchased this book new at a book store."
2,Disappointingly mediocre,"One of the biggest let-downs of all time. Anne's intentions are laudable; the book tries to set the scene for many of the incidents and factors that emerge in the later (Pern chronology-wise) novels. But the book tries to do too much in very short order and ends up as a disjointed series of events, told in a horrifyingly incoherent manner. Only when she concentrates on the beloved dragons in the telling of the founding of Benden Weyr, with Torene and Mihall, does the old gold McCaffrey shine through. I waited for this book with such anticipation and felt like a deflated balloon before I was half way through. Please Anne, you can do much better than this."
2,The story was good but...,"I really did like the stories. But I do think the language could have been avoided. In all the books about the original settlers from Earth (except some of the short stories),there was awful language. That is the only reason, in my opinion, that this book doesn't get 4 or 5 stars"
2,Below Standard,"New? not even close. Plastic wrapping fell apart in my hands, then the cover fell off. I will not deal with this company again and would not recommend it to others."
1,"""School & Library"" binding is abysmal","Spent ~$10 extra on the ""School & Library"" binding, thinking I would get a durable hardback. Instead, what I got was a paperback edition glued into a cardboard cover.Save your money and go for the paperback, or search used book sellers for a real hardcover edition."
5,Tried and true,"I have relied on this product to pre-condition water for my tank for about 5 years.This vendor is great - fast shipment, well packed, ahead of time."
5,Works Great!!!,"I forgot to use this product for a while and my newer fish started to die quickly, the pet shop reminded me that the stress coal will help the fish transition to their new home much better. I used it and the fish didn't die anymore. Also, the amount you need to use maked the product a greay value!"
4,Stress Coat,Stress Coat is a great water conditioner but you need seperate conditioner for metals. I don't use no other conditioners due to my water is safe as far as metals go.
5,Five Mile Creek,"I have watched 10 series of Five mile creek, I think it deserves a higher rating than 1 to 10. It is an excellent movie. I have 10 video in the series and would love to find the other 10 mivies in this series. 11 thru 20. thank you' Linda Womack"
3,MUGGS RULES,"This production of Muggs are greath,PUPPET MASTER,DEVIL WHIT A BLUE DRESS are my favotites songs."
3,anti bling bling hip hop,"This was released during the height of the BAD BOY, No Limit run and Cypress Hill had all but dissapeared so I never knew about this.This is stripped down, bare bones hip hop.Some real good tracks on here (B-Real, MC Eiht, Infamous Mobb) but you need to be into these artists to enjoy it- not for the casual rap fan."
5,Awesome CD,"Karmyn's vocals are outstanding and Chris' musical arrangements make this album the one you should have for your CD library. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,Soothing music,"I had this in a CD, but gave it to my brother. I've never been able to find it in a CD since and was delighted to find this cassette."
4,Could Be Cheaper,"Only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. Otherwise, this is a loud graphic on a really nice Les Paul. When you can get LP Standards for over a Grand less, you really need to make a statement (and a paycheck)to want to pay the extra dime for this premium edition. Though I haven't tried the Epiphone version yet, they are selling for about 1/7 the price. You can always pay a few bucks to upgrade the copy too!"
5,Lovely book,Love this book - my baby's nursery is all winnie the pooh and this looks great on the bookshelf. Will start reading it to him when he is more interested in storiesGreat book!
5,Sumptuous -- Absolutely Sumptuous!!!,"I recieved this book (and its companion, the color edition of ""The House At Pooh Corner"") as a gift. I cannot speak more highly of them both. Unlike the editor at Horn, who found that the colorization detracted from the illustrations, I find exactly the opposite -- that the color lends depth and detail to the drawings, which are completely untouched otherwise.The paper is crisp, semi-glossy, and brilliant white; the cover and page edges are guilded; the typeface is sharp and crystal-clear; and the full-color endpapers are truly magnificent.In all and every way this is a truly magnificent and sumptuous edition -- with perhaps the single exception of price. And even then, with such a marvelous work, that is to be expected!"
3,Annoying Piglet voice.,"We bought this for a road trip, thinking it would be relaxing for a family of Pooh lovers. It started out rather nice. The voice for Pooh is a bit more ""gruff"" than we have imagined him to be in our minds, but still nice to listen to. We found Rabbit came across quite harsh, but did not ruin the story. And then we heard Piglet... Oh! What an annoying voice! It is a screechy, high-pitched sort that hurt the ears. One of the kids tucked their head like they were hiding, and the oldest said ""That voice is annoying!"" We turned it off, needless to say. The braver of the kids still listens to this CD and gets quite a bit of use out it; most of us just find it hard to enjoy."
1,Penguin please reconsider the price of your E-Books!,"I am having a difficult time getting my head wrapped around the price gouging that Penguin has been doing on their e-books, this is the second book in a month that I thought of purchasing for the Kindle that they have priced themselves out of. I have bought both books that were overpriced from used bookstores and penguin has lost money, I hope that they will come to their senses and start pricing books reasonably for the kindle. Until then I will buy the books used or borrow them from the library just to keep from giving them my money. That is unless they lower the price."
1,E-books shouldn't cost more than Hardcover,"Don't get me wrong, the REAL book is awesome... a classic i loved from my childhood, but an e-Book should NEVER cost more than the hardcover book. I was really dissapointed when I saw the price. Guess I will have to wait a few more years until the price is reasonable."
3,Not entirely accurate,"Broadbent does a good job reading the book, but he misreads one of my favorite bits: Pooh says ""you never can tell with bees"", but Broadbent consistently reads ""you can never tell with bees"". A small thing, but I find it distracting."
5,Building Memories,"I remember taking this book out of the library and reading it in our yard at the picnic table as a little girl. I bought this for my granddaughter who is old enough to read it on her own. She's seen the Winnie the Pooh movies and heard the stories read to her, but was thrilled to have her own copy to read.Classics are like that. This is a must read for any child."
5,Winnie-the-Pooh,"This was received in outstanding condition, well packaged for shipment, and prompt delivery. Great little book!"
4,"Wonderful dramatization, but misses some of the charm","My 2-year old son absolutely loves listening these before he goes to sleep, while he's playing, in the car... pretty much any time. The actors all do a fabulous job of bringing the characters to life. However, if you've read the originals, there's something special about the way Milne writes that's left out in the dramatization. The rhythm of his writing, with the ""He said...said he"" and such is so much fun to read, as are his descriptions of how the characters said things, which are all left out in this production. I love these, but I'm going to get the Peter Dennis recordings so we can hear the stories as Milne wrote them."
3,My hope was...,that it would be more of a picture book. My daughter was not interested in hearing the stories without the pictures.
2,Not happy with it,"A book as popular as this one, and as wanted as this one from little children should have much, much more and better illustrations!!!!"
5,Winnie the Pooh,"This historic, even legendary, book should be shared with every child. Parents should always read to children, and Winnie the Pooh is a wonderful place to begin. This book - and the other Pooh books - are classics; they fall far beyond the province of a "" review."" They simply are part of our heritage. ( And if they're not a part of YOUR heritage, it's YOUR problem, not Pooh's.)"
1,Waaaay too expensive.,"I love these books . . . first read to me by my mother back in the 50's. They are classics (at least the first two, never got around to reading ""When We Were Very Young"" or ""Now We Are Six"") and even today have to power to take me back to a simpler time, to enthrall and enchant me once again . . .BUT . . . the price Penguin wants for the Kindle editions is unacceptable.I guess it's out to the storeroom to dig through endless boxes of books for my original copies. I will not pay the exorbitant price being asked here.A.A. Milne is long dead and so should these books now be in the public domain. Copyright laws were intended to protect authors, not their distant heirs or large corporations."
4,Sweet Pooh,"This is very cute and will be great for my 4 year old....in about 2 or 3 years. I guess I thought it would be somewhat more geared to a little one, but it's a bit ""dry"" & boring for 4 yrs old. I thought it was very sweet and cute; I'm sure in time he will too."
2,Happy but Sad,"The 20"" RC Boat Navy Battle Ship HT-2877 was a fabulous enjoyment for me and my 4 year old grandchild. The ship looked great, it maneuvered great (forward, backward, left, right), and the motor speed was just right and very manageable in the pool. After two weeks of fun the 5 batteries developed leaks and wouldn't charge anymore. The fatal blow was I could not find a like replacement 5-battery configuration pack. The ship is now just a floating ship!"
4,Fun for home,Fun product to use in the pool. Easy to control and fast. The batteries charge quickly and last for a long time.
3,JUST OK,"Not very fast in the water. Is fun, but if I wopuld decide to order another boat I would not order this one."
4,Me and my son very happy,I bought it for gift my son birthday He was very exited and happy to use it . So it was very good gift
2,didn't work.,"i was super excited to give this to my friend's kid, but after we put it together and followed all the instructions, it didn't work. it's a cool boat regardless, and until it didn't work it was pretty exciting, but yeah, didn't work. ***in the seller's defense, i didn't try to return it, 'cause i'm a jerk.***"
1,Terrible product,This boat comes with no instructions. Yo never know when the charge is full. I have had it for a few hours and will return it asap. Another Chinese piece of junk.
1,don't waste your money,This is a piece of junk. The boat will turn on but the controller does not make the boat move at all.
1,Did not work at all,"Receive this product quickly and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. The item came with absolutely no instruction in English. It is probably ""fresh off the boat"" from China. As much as I could try to figure out by guessing what the pictures were saying, the item did not work anyway. The propeller did not turn at all. I ended up returning the item without even having the boat touching the water. What a waste of time and money, not to mention the disappointing face on my kid."
5,Isabelle THE Antena,"If you're familiar with ESL's music , you probably know Isabelle Antena already.She was the girl singing on the opening track of their first compilation (vol1).Thievery Corporation are currently working with her (so say their website).Isabelle is more than the queen of lounge , she created the style.Camino del sol , her first record under the name Antena is a must and shows how the girl is the pionner of electro samba.This ""best of"" is a perfect example of her beautiful work and the 3 life tracks just make me want to go and see her on stage.wonderful!"
5,The Andean Cocaine Industry,"As a person who has lived in and conducted business in Colombia, and as someone who is interested in the subjects of Colombian history, economics, and the country's struggle to maintain its own internal sovereignty, I found The Anean Cocaine Industry to be extremely informative. Bravo to Clawson and Lee -- a job well done. If you are interested in cocaine, its production and its socio-political and economic impacts, this book is an educational must read. Bottom line: a wonderfully comprehensive text on this subject."
1,False security,"Like most ""5-in-1"" style pieces of survival gear, this is a poorly made hodge-podge of flimsy, weak, and unreliable swag. Items like this are sold to people on the basis of the inaccurate notion that anything is better than nothing. No. The right gear is better than nothing. If you are preparing to take care of yourself in a pinch, spend a few more bucks and get stuff that works, works well, and survives rough conditions. This toy will not do any of those things.And, as with all emergency tools, practice using it in real-world, adverse environments before you hit the road, or trail, or whatever. Tools are worthless until you have practiced with them enough to know how to use them even in the worst of conditions; because, if you ever need them, it will almost certainly be in the worst of conditions. Learn from my experiences, or you will be compelled to learn from your own, and you might not be as lucky as I have been."
3,More than a Toy,"The pros: bright orange and therefore easy to find in low light or if you drop it on the ground, compass works fine for gross direction finding, hollow center allows you to store 6 storm-proof matches plus striking strip. So you can navigate and start a fire. You can even use the lanyard to tie a couple of sticks together or make a crude snare.Cons: whistle not the loudest, plastic isn't bullet-proof.So, all in all, a great purchase for the money."
1,Junk. Buy the SOL Origin,"Very low quality. A child's toy. Either build your own survival kit, or buy the SOL Origin. I have written an extensive review of the origin."
5,Awsomeness,"I like it! It came as it, the fire starter thingy (forgot what it was called) broke off but it was useless anyways. But the compass is awsome and i was able to put my tiny flashlight in the water proof container. THis product is really cute and fun for adventures. RECommendFast shipping too! 5 stars!"
2,"Okay, so the whistle works, but...","... really, what could you expect of a cheap piece of made-in-China plastic? I got two of these for a set of stick-in-the-car emergency kits, and while one seemed fine, the compass on the other didn't know what was up, down east or west. A 50 percent failure rate is not particularly reassuring if I'm planning on using this thing to get out of a messy situation. It is very, very orange, though, so it'll be quite easy for the search crew to find my remains after I get thoroughly lost trying to use this thing to navigate to safety."
1,Life-endangering junk.,"Where do I begin? Emergency equipment should not be a liability. This device is just that. A liability. When you need it, you will find it will not function as intended. I had purchased three of these devices for 'gift' emergency kits I made. In testing the gear, I discovered on each device the same identical problems:The whistle - barely worksThe flint - is worthless, doesn't function at all.The compass - has a bubble and consistently reads completely wrongThe waterproof case - isn't very waterproofThe only thing that works on this device:It's orange. That means it's bright and can be noticed easilyThe lanyard - because seriously, how do you screw up a nylon rope? Apparently even a blind squirrel can find a nut once in a while.If you're willing to look at this device as a gimmick or novelty, then by all means it's worth the low price. But if you are relying on it for safety or emergency gear, you're going to be sorely disappointed should said emergency ever occur."
3,MAUREEN O'HARA,Bought this movie because I'm a big O'HARA fan. Didn't care for it as MAUREEN was in a thankless role.
5,The best kids' series!,"My son and I discovered the first book in The Roman Mysteries series in our local library. We both loved it - and waited so patiently for the second! Then, in the summer, we visited England. And discovered the rest! Pirates of Pompeii, which is, thankfully, available in America, was our favorite. If it was possible to choose. We could not put this down! I would recommend reading this after The Secrets of Vesuvius, since the action picks up from the next day. What a great page turner!"
4,Intriguing,"I found the book The Pirates of Pompeii interesting. In the beginning I found it boring, as I read on it became better and better. It is an excellent mystery that keeps you guessing until the last page."
2,Bad luck connecting to computer,I recently bought this printer. I tried installing it on two of my computers : windows 98 and 2000 and I didnt have any luck on either of them. I read the directions from the manual and still didnt have any luck. I am taking it back and getting something else.
1,Print directly from a digital camera?,I own a Sony Mavica 3.3 Digital camera that utilizes a cd for photo storage. I bought this Sony DPPSV55 thinking it would print directly from the camera. It did not. I emailed Sony technical assistance and they stated the printer would not print out directly from this camera and they had no product that would print from cds; only floppy disks and Memory cards.Very disappointing. I love the camera but I would like to have a portable photo printer that bypasses the use of a PC.
4,2182 Kilohertz,"Started slow (all that about the frozen sewage pile), but if you stay with it until Chapter 5 (aboard Fearless), you won't be able to put it down. The laudatory dust-jacket reviews were, in this instance, dead on. Well-written, funny, erotic and top-flight adventure with satisfying ending."
2,Sound???,"The sound quality of this video is horrible. One minute you can't hear it at all, then the next it blasts you out of your chair. Awful!!!!"
5,Satisfied,The item arrived quickly and sealed as new. I have not opened it as it is a present. I trust it will be in excellent condition when it is opened.
5,One of 90s rarest CDs!,"One of 90s rarest CDs! 13 great R&B; tracks by r&b; duo Terri&Monica.; Impossible to find album. It was only ever issued in Europe and WITHDRAWN IMMEDIATELY. UNRELEASED IN USA.Produced by Horace Brown. GRAB IT IF YOU""LL FIND IT!!!"
5,Wonderful focus on listening!,"Many students have trouble with the learning part of the TOEFL because it requires them to hear, understand, process, and then apply the foreign language. This book is so wonderful because it gives students extra practice in one of the more difficult areas of the TOEFL test, the listening section. Students can use the written tests as practice, but they can also use a CD-ROM and cassette tapes to really hone their listening skills. The practice exercises and tests in the book are just like those that students will really take, so the practice is not only in listening skills, but also in test-taking skills.This book is a wonderful took for students looking for general TOEFL format practice, and especially those looking for practice int he listening area of the TOEFL. The writers have really focused on understanding the problems their readers may have encountered, and on solving those problems with practical, applicable tips and hints."
5,"ugly, depraved, brilliant","This is the most beautifully vulgar disc I've come across in quite some time. The gritty recording quality is completely suited to the depraved lyrical content. And man, the ""singer's"" voice, like nails on a chalk board that's been locked in a coffin. This disc actually sounds like it was recorded in the basement of Gacy's place. If you like your punk ugly and gutteral, do yourself a favour and buy this. NOW."
2,unexciting music,"I got this along with Bregovic's Silence of the Balkans and Czas Cyganow. All three of them are uninteresting, and uninspiring to me, much less energizing as some reviewers mentioned. I was so influenced by reviewer enthusiasm, I unwisely bought all three simultaneously. Big mistake! No more Bregovic for me! How anyone can get much Balkans out of his music is baffling to me."
5,An attack on your soul & mind,"Coming from Slovenia I was always a little bit ""cold"" to stuff from Balkan. But listening to the live performance of Bregovic's ""Wedding & Funeral Band"" last weekend in Ljubljana trigged something in me, that goes over complexes and political opinions. Goran is an artist in first place, doesn't matter what they say. Listening the full chorus sang ""Ederlezi"", catapults you above the clouds. I am usually not a pathetic person, that's a fact ! You have to have it !"
5,A fine and so different music,"I havent't too many reasons to be proud as balcanian. War, misery, intolerance, nationalism. But I feel fine as a ""neighbour"" of Goran Bregovic. Be carefull. It's a very fine music. You must listen many times and taste it. Not every ""american fan music"" can understand and like it. It's a question of taste. And of being smart too."
3,Music samples to short to ascertain.,Not the same music as the movie and wasn't able to tell that from the short samples.
3,QUEEN MARGOT REIGNS HERE,"If the listener enjoys tracks 1,9,10 & 15 he should definitely buy Bregovic's incredible score to the film ""La Reine Margot"". ""Ederlezi"" is eclectic in its sound, a song with Iggy Pop called ""TV Screen"" is a definite miss. There are some other 'wedding songs' featured on this CD that I also do not enjoy. Although, I think it is worth purchasing though. ""Underground Tango"" is another beautiful piece, along with ""Dreams"". But definitely get ""Queen Margot""..."
3,A proper London solicitor meets a topsy-turvy widow...,"Due to a series of mishaps, Edward Netherford winds up staying at an unlikely Yorkshire bed & breakfast in the home of a young widow. She and her three children begin to grow on him, but he believes that his best friend is in love with the widow. Edward decides to bow out, yet he keeps coming back. Witness the final resolution in ""Out of the Rain""."
2,Not her best,This book really falls short of what I expect from Elizabeth Cadell books. It is mostly bland and the characters are not as rich and entertaining as some of her other books. For a really good Cadell book try Honey for Tea or Mrs Westerby Changes Course. They are both excellent and much better than Out of the Rain.
2,works....,"the slide button is not comfortable, and the slide motion is not smooth. Worse, the blade does not lock in place in any way so you have to apply pressure at all times or the blade will just get pushed back into the handle while you are trying to work"
4,Eastern European Religious Minimalist,"Korndorf, a native of Russia who moved to Canada, self-identified with the Eastern European religious minimalists such as Gorecki and Part, and his Hymns reflect this. They feature a deep, meditative droning that occasionally swells in volume and thickness of tone, creating an effect that, while somewhat depressive, conveys what one person might imagine as the infinity, endurance, and strength of God."
3,"Tetris for win 95 ,98","Great game but pay attention to system compatability. This will not work in XP, I hadn't noticed till I updated my Mom's computer. She loved it but I can't find an XP compatable version"
5,MUST HAVE DVD,I love this workout. So must fun. It goes by so fast and you really work up a good cardio sweat yet it isnt hard. I love love love this one. It's such a great workout. My new favorite.
5,Exhilarating yoga,I am a big fan of Mariel and have read her book about healthy living. She got me started in Yoga and this DVD set is the best I have done and most fun. The 30 minute one really got me going. I love Rodney Yee also. The 2 10 minutes ones are wonderful too. I really like doing the 10 minutes in the morning before I go to work. It makes me feel like I actually worked out.
3,It's Okay,"I like the 50 minute dvd, it's a nice change if you just want to do some form of yoga but 30 minutes feels too short. Mariel's voice over is annoying. Also, at the end of the program they both talk about taking a moment of ""quiet"" to go inside yourself but they talk through this moment the entire time. I just work out with the dvd and turn off the sound."
3,too much yacking,I like Rodney on his own - best yet is his 5 day am yoga. my husband said this sounded like a reality series fro afar. The poses are standard with some cardio mixed in.
4,Effective Voice,"Russell Coward's ""A Voice from the Vietnam War"" aptly describes his one-year experience teaching English to Vietnamese soldiers in Vietnam. His insight into his feelings during that tumultous period in U.S. history should give junior and high school students, to whom the book is directed, an idea of what many felt. Hopefully the book will raise an interest and awareness in students (and adults) that will propel them to read more on the subject."
4,Fantastic!,"A well written book on Zen. Along with ""Three pillars of Zen"", I've made this book a gift to many of my students. I most like the chapter ""The Zen Circle"". It is a fine way to desribe ""the mind"" to anyone interested in this subject matter."
4,Great Teachings From a Great Master,"Great short teachings, short stories.But read Master Seung Sahn's ""Compass of Zen"" first."
3,"The teachings... all the same , all different","One ought to be a student of some time to appreciate the teachings of this book.I would not call it a beginners book.Zen master Seung Sahn, Has a traditional teaching here; of the school he foundedand is quite different than the Vipassana approach. Not better not worse, justdifferent. We are all trying to deconstruct the ego and wake up to what is,not the illusions, beliefs and concepts we have all been laboring with as real,that aren't."
3,"Good, but not the best","Kingston By Starlight was a teriffic book about Anne Bonny and her life as a pirate. It deffinatly got me hooked on pirate books about Mary Read and Calico Jack, but this book in particular didnt have enough fiction for me. It must be hard to write a book on historical facts and still make it interesting, but just look around at the other pirate books about Anne and you will get an idea on how dissapointing this book was after I had read the others like it."
3,"Not so ""Easy-to-Open"" can","Bestine is Bestine and it works just fine, but the caps on the can that you push down and turn to open don't work. I finally had to pry off the plastic cover that revealed the metal cap that screws on. As it turns out, the spouts, on both cans that I purchased, were attached, welded or whatever in a way that the caps wouldn't work as directed. I also noticed that they weren't sealed well where they were attached to the can. I finally poured the one that I opened into an old empty can that fortunately I had kept and will do the same with the second can when I need it. Hopefully, it won't evaporate before then!"
3,overpriced,go to your local hvac store cheaper in bunches case was nice but you can go thru this asst on just a few jobs overpriced
3,Decent....,"I purchased this kit simply out of laziness. Had a small project coming up, and didn't want to make a trip to Menard's just for this. So-so kit, but you could get more for less by just going to your local big box store."
2,Good assortment...poorly packaged,"The assortment of pieces is as advertised and are very good quality, but the brittle plastic container is bottom-end. Amazon sent an opened container (labeling from mfg seals the container) that had obviously been returned to the Kentucky Return Center."
4,this is the new version,This edition is easier to read better quality in terms of explaining the chapter and pictures in details
5,Massage School Text Book,This is the book that my class used when I went thru massage school. An excellent book for students and for helping you to pass the National Exam. There is a lot of anatomy in this book and it touches on massage modes and modalities. I would recommend it to any student that wants to pass that big test.
4,Massage Therapy:Principles and Practice by Susan G,"Never buy a used book,recomend a new book but however it's a very nice book to read and apply in your live therapist or people who like that cain of reading,increase the culture about massage!!!!!!!"
1,This tape puts the ZZZZZ in Stieglitz,"The producers of this tape faced a challenging task to capture the greatest photographer of all time, who was a fascinating, complex person, in 30 minutes.But they've accomplished the impossible here -- the result is a complete snoozer, guaranteed to put even diehard Stieglitz fans like myself right to sleep.Don't bother with this one, folks. Let's hope PBS or the Learning Channel gives it a shot -- until then, we really don't have a video of Stieglitz."
2,Spend Your Time and Money Elsewhere,"This book is the self involved, self indulgent ramblings of a man sorely in need of a focus, attention and an editor.Schechter's affluent upbringing and star-struck posturing unfortunately cannot mask his angry writing style which labors under the cute witicisms his young fans find so endearing on his website. This book is shallow and long-winded; spend your money and time elsewhere."
3,"At last, at last","I greatly enjoyed At Last The 1948 Show when it was on the air in the late 1960s but, forty years on, could recall only a couple of sketches and then just dimly. Would it stand up? How significant was it really in the evolution of British comedy?Well, after watching the DVD set, I can say it was a mixed bag but a mixed bag that is well worth seeing. Some of the sketches are not only a bit weak and silly but come across as amateurish in comparison to, say, Monty Python's Flying Circus. The best bits are however absolute gems that deserve to stand as classics. My favourite is a sketch in a train compartment done by John Cleese and Marty Feldman -- it is side-splittingly funny. I am tempted to say that it was largely Marty who made At Last The 1948 Show as good as it was although the lovely Aimi MacDonald is also mighty memorable."
3,less funny than Python,"These five half hour programs are not as funny as Monty Python, but still amusing. The production budget was low and so most of the material is people wearing suits in office environments. Many of the sketches are too long and drawn out which reduces their amusement level."
2,Weak stuff,"Here are five old half hour television shows that are important only to those interested in the subsequent histories of the participants. The material is very weak. And the bits with women, namely one Aimi Macdonald, are so bad they are embarrassing. It's great to see Marty Feldman, and he does more than his share to keep things afloat. Mostly these programs point to the genius that soon inspired the Monty Python series and, later, several humorous films."
4,BASE Jumping,"I had the opertunity to see a show called A day in the life of Jeb Corliss. I was so impressed with his life I researhed more on him and came up with this DVD. Its not quite like what I expected, but facinating none the less. If your a fan of either Iiro, or Jeb this is for you."
5,In any language ~ PASO A PASO is MOLTO GREAT !,"Having minimal knowledge of Latin, I base my review exclusively on musicality (hooks and the basic musical emotion). The tracks will emotionally impact all listeners. The songs on this product are raw yet very innovative in their approach.I was completely enthralled with this CD. The vocal talent of LUIS FONSI is above criticism. The crafted musical production is innovation and refreshing.The label has a potential cross over hit on their hands.They should actively encourage this talented unknown artist to push his project in mainstream markets."
5,Fonsi's back with another hit!,"Luis Fonsi's latest release is another hit. I first listened to the first song promoted "" Nada es para Siempre"" and loved it! I was waiting for the release of this cd for weeks and must say, that even though "" Abrazar La Vida"" is still my favorite, this one will get far on Billboard Charts also, due to the great songs included, such as ""Paso a Paso"" and Vivo Muriendo. Can't wait to see him live performing all of his songs. Luis Fonsi's voice is powerful!"
3,Not the best album in his career,"I listened to it, Yeah I did. I even watched the music video of ""Nada es para siempre"" and as a Big fonsi fan, I gotta be sincere and Objetive in my review. This cd is not your best, The songs are a little weak, too much sound and less voice, he trying to go into ""R & b"" it's not his best choice, He needs better songs, and better stories, Because the stories he tells us in this CD are too slow. It's not his worse, but it's not his best. ""Abrazar la vida"" was the best cd of his carreer."
4,a nice option,"This Noah's ark switch plate is nice, with a cute little monkey hanging over the edge. The material is ""3-D""/textured, like a carving instead of the flat picture that is usually used on covers, and the etching had a good amount of detail. The heart even has something etched in it, but I was not able to make out all of the words on it. The texture makes the switch plate look artistic, but it also stands off the wall about a centimeter, and with the depth and texture combined, it is difficult to find the light switch in the dark. There is enough of the light switch coming through that I do not have a hard time flipping it on, but since the whole switch plate cover stands off the wall and has various levels and grooves in the carving, it can take a little time to find which bump is the light switch. On looks alone I might have given this five stars, but the poor functionality knocks it down to a four or maybe even three."
4,It was the drink of water I had thirsted for!,"Intense storytelling! You need to pay attention to keep up, there are lots of characters and lineage to follow. It's worth it! Entertaining! Enlightening! I read it three months ago and I intend to take it on the plane as I leave the country (long flight) ...and read it again. Slower...to digest more fully, what my heart/soul starved for. Again, a D E E P drink of water!I'd love to meet this author and have a roundtable."
3,disappointed,"I was disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. This if very comfortable but did not really improve the belly bulge or give me better shaping in the waist area. Also, having a small top as I do (Size A) I would've liked to have had more padding in the bra."
4,"Comfortable, keep you in good shape? Not quite","I'm skinny, below 110 lbs and I'm pretty tall about 5 feet 3. My friend saw me the first thing they called was to eat some more. Recently, my belly is a little rounder than its supposed to be due to my job is sitting all day long.I purchased this Body Briefer, its so so comfortable. I almost forgot that I was wearing it the whole day. However, it doesn't shaping your body much. As you can see, I'm skinny but it couldn't do the job.So I guess in order to control your body shape, its gotta be uncomfortable, hurt a little. Since this item is way comfortable, thus it doesn't do the other job"
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this looking for a nice all over body briefer as it was advertised. The cut and fit on this was HORRIBLE. I am short 5'3"" and short waisted) so it I was pretty suprised to find this really didnt fit in length, where it pulled so uncomfortably in the crotch and also pulled down in the top, that after 30 minutes of wearing it, it was so uncomfortable and also looked so bad, I realised I wasted my money. I can only imagine how it fits a taller long waisted person if it fit me so badly. I would honestly recommend anything but this."
5,Perfect Little Body Smoother,"This briefer is really nice. It's better than I expected. No lines, easy to get on and off, yet it does smooth and slim my body! I've worn it under a dress and jumpsuit so far and I love it. I'm planning to get another soon!"
4,Comfy and supportive,"I've owned these sorts of body suits before and I've always loved them, they're cup sizes are true to size and the support the body provides is great. Can wear it under pants or dresses and all are equally comfortable."
5,A fantastic archive of interior and exterior architecture!,"Any architecture aficionado will be amazed by this book! Want to know what a front door would have looked like in England in 1750? A stairway in Italy in 1530? Windows in Boston in 1910? This book has it! The b/w and color diagrams are outstanding, the text is interesting, and I consider this to be the best overall book on architecture that I've ever seen."
3,Comprehensive...but better for Britain,"I am restoring an 1840s Greek Revival farmhouse in upstate New York, so I was eager to read this book, hoping for useful info on Greek Revival interiors. Disappointingly, the book lumps all American Adamesque, Federal-style, and Greek Revival architecture together into one meager 27-page chapter. These three styles of architecture once dominated this country for over half a century! It seems like British architecture is given more comprehensive treatment in this book. It'll look nice on the coffee table, but real early-American architecture buffs should look elsewhere."
5,Wonderful,"As an Architectural Illustrator in black and white media, this book has been an invaluable reference tool. As a Librarian, no Library should be without this book. The only thing that one could wish for is that it was a multi-volume set with many more pages to peruse, like a novel you don't want to end."
4,Good music for Hula dancing,Since I am taking Hula dance lessons I thought I would give this CD a try. It is fun to listen toand practice too.
1,Not what I ordered,"The description says costmetic spatula and when the package arrived it was a flimsy plastic bowl. I sent an e-mail to the company and never heard back from them. The picture displays a bowl and a spatula, two different items listed for the same company. They sent me the bowl, even though the confirmation e-mails and the receipt listed it as a spatula."
1,Two lamps; different finishes.,"I ordered this lamp and liked it so much I later ordered a second one. The second one doesn't have any of the subtle iridescence in the amber glass shade, which made the first one so lovely, and is part of the product description."
5,What we needed,"Fiasco did it, his first major LP release is a solid straight threw with out skipping a track album.We asked for something real, and he served it up on some of the best beats I have herd in the last 3 years.Best Tracks:Kick, Push IIThe CoolPressureRealDaydreamSunshineThis man is painting picutes with your speakers!"
5,GOOD MUSIC AND THOUGHTFUL LYRICS,"The beats are mean, but the lyrics are nice. Finally, a cd worth paying for: original, attractive (not alienating), not pompous, pious."
5,Great Album,"Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor is a great album, fresh beats with great lyrics. He has that mellow hip hop flow and he has his own sound, not trying to sound like common or talib kweli who has that similiar hip hop flow. And ""kick push"" is not the best track on the album, so you don't have to worry that you've heard the best track on the album a million times already, plenty of hot tracks to choose from."
4,He is one of the GOATs!,"Great from beginning to end. U can listen to every track, enjoy it or learn something. One of the Greatest of all times...nuff said!"
3,worth supporting,well i honestly expected more from this cd. the touch the sky mixtape defintely a classic mixtape and i recommend that over this cd.maybe if i never heard that mixtape i will never had i expectations for this cd its good though maybe have to grow on me. im from chicago so its hard for me to right this and give it the review but as a hip hop fan i had to be real. its worth the listen but be caution it may not live up to the hype defintely not better then college dropout nor one of my top ten but i am glad that lyrics and hiphop is staying alive.
4,Solid Debut,"3.5/5Chances are Lupe Fiasco's Food and Liquor is unlike any hip hop album you've heard. It's refreshing, enigmatic, eclectic, thought-provoking, and above all deep, as Lupe puts his heart and soul into this debut album. While the lyrics and production are above average, the album's biggest strength is Lupe's unique cadence, which enables him to move gracefully from line to line all way through his verses. The subject matter is the main weakness of this album, since there are certain songs where he just rambles on about random things from line to line, never focusing on the same subject. Overall this album is very listenable, though."
4,Great start by Lupe,Good album not brilliant. thought some tracks were better on the bootleg version of the album like Pressure even though Jigga does make it a good. Hip Hop alum of the year for me!!!
4,"I stole this from my son, so...","he's going to have to buy another for himself, it's that good. 'Nuff said !!"
5,Great compilation,"Wow, I'm sure glad this set was released. I've always loved Robert Klein, and bought his ""Child of the 50's"" CD about fifteen years ago. I'd only seen two of his HBO specials from the 80's (we couldn't afford HBO in the 70's and early 80's), but I'd always remembered them well. For some reason Robert Klein hasn't remained in the public consciousness the way George Carlin has, but I think of them as similar (and both very funny). This collection is really a smokin' deal, considering that it's over 8 hours of material and most of it was never released before, even on VHS.This collection would be even better if it included his comedy CD's, some of which are out of print. But that's a minor complaint. For the money, this collection is a steal."
5,"Not for the audiophile, but I like it","If you're an audiophile, don't bother. But if you just want a nice little system to play your cd's and the radio, this is a great option. Of course, as a Sony, the design is gorgeous and it never fails to elicit some ooh's and ahh's from my friends who see it.I've never had a problem with the vertical loader (and trust me, this thing is always playing something if I'm in the room) and the sound is clear to *me*. As I've said before, I'm not one of those types who need crystal clear, every pitch perfect, highs and lows. I pump it up sometimes, it's fine. I turn it down when I'm reading, it's fine. So if you just need a system for, say, your office, this is a good choice."
1,"Good looking, slick little system, but poor sound quality.","This system is attractively packaged, and rather appealing with its vertical loading spinning disk visible while playing. Other features are as expected on a bookshelf system of this type.Unfortunately, the sound quality leaves a great deal to be desired. I realize that there is only so much to be had from 3"" speakers, but this system sounds like a $[money] Walmart special, not a $[money] Sony. The midrange is surprisingly good, but the bass is very muddy, and the upper third of the piano keyboard gives me a headache to listen to. Not at all enjoyable.I returned the unit for credit after listening for three days.Suggestion: bite the bullet and spend another $[money] for a Yamaha mini-system. You'll never look back..."
5,Incredibly powerful book,"This is a great book to really take your time reading and really reflect on what is written. She gives many incredibly insightful thoughts and ideas as well as sections at the end of each chapter for a review with a few fundamental questions.One that really stands out in my mind deals with forgiveness, and she states if you are having trouble forgiving people presend the next time you talk to them is their last day on earth.Very powerful book and very insightful."
5,spirituriffic,Food for thought:~) I liked that there were exercises to do through the duration of the book. It will help me tremendously as I venture on my journey to self discovery!
3,I learnt a few things about how to deal with angry people,It was a good book. Not very many meditation exercises but a lot of context on how to deal with negative energies or people. I felt like this book was more to help people that are in difficult life situations and how to build their intuition. I was looking more for a book that can excel my intuition but dont need life coaching (but some of it was useful).
5,This book changed my life.,"This book helps you understand that life's ups and down are 100% in your control because it is all in how you perceive it. And that you can have enormous power in improving your life and others' by focusing on positive energy, and seeing the positive in the negative. It also helps you see how happiness comes from not allowing others to negatively affect you by recognizing that their actions are often motivated out of fear which should be treated with compassion (love) and not fear back. Read the book and you will see the light."
4,A GUIDE TO SENSITIVTY,"THIS BOOK CLARIFIED A LOT OF ISSUES AND STRUGGLES IN MY LIFE, AS DID SOME OTHER SANAYA ROMAN BOOKS, YET THIS BOOK SEEMED TO BE WRITTEN JUST FOR ME. IT WAS LIKE LOOKING INTO A MIRROR, YET A VERY SENSITIVE MIRROR, A MIRROR THAT WAS HONEST AND YET CAREFUL, LOVING AND WISE. A BOOK FULL OF THE HIGHEST FORM OF COMMON SENSE I HAVE YET DISCOVERED. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE."
4,As always a good book,"I really love sanaya's books, they leave you with a warm feeling and an inner knowing. This book was very good but i wish there were more excersizes like her other books ie spiritual growth."
5,Truely more than five stars,"Having done many vodou ceremonies with the author and her Ounfo I can testify that this is one of the greatest books on Vodou I have ever read! Sallie Ann is so down to earth and sweet and will not only listen to whatever hurts you, but will give you both a spiritual and physical answer to it. I have a friend that belongs to her Ounfo and my experiences with Sallie has been nothing but enjoyable. Her artwork is pouring out of this book, along with her vast knowlegde of the Lwas and Orishas. For all who are curious to those who have been initiated, this book is nothing but an asset."
5,Beautifully written,"I found Vodou Visions to be a beautiful, soulful look at this spiritual practice. I was fortunate enough to be a participant in a recent ritual conducted by Sallie Ann Glassman. The book really explained a lot that I couldn't understand about the ritual and expanded my knowledge about the practice of vodou. Ms. Glassman is clearly rooted in this tradition and explains it masterfully with a beauty of spirit and the desire to bring her love of this tradition to her readers. I highly recommend it as a primer and a way to dispel the common myths around this religion."
1,whos that girl again?,"Mambo (-jumbo) Sallie Ann Glassman used to be a high initiate of the OTO for YEARS before she decided to leave the Thelemic order, travel to Haiti, ask around for someone to initiate her (waiving a bundle of $$$ bills in people's faces) and come back to the US to start a ""made-up vodou house"" in New Orleans. She practiced Voodoo Gnostic Mass Michael Bertiaux style for years before attempting to create vegetarian ""lets all have one grade of initiation"" vodou. People...its time to wake up and smell the bull#! If you meet the woman in person you'll know what I mean!Yes, people can change, but what kind of change is this? Sallie Ann Glassman now practices vodou, but what kind of vodou is it? Her own made up mambo-jumbo, as far removed from Haitian Vodou as possible! Is its New Orleans Vodou? No, not eve that, cause New Orleans voodoo doesn't have initiations, pieces of Haitian liturgy or the Ason, colje or pot-tet! PLEASE! Gimme a break!"
5,milestone,This book is a milestone in the history of ethnomusicology. The author enlarges the field of ethnomusicology to discusse the meaning of music within a culture entity.
3,"Ok, but....","Unlike the other reviewer, i have normal/thin calves, so these boots were all wobly on me and even tho i got my usual shoe size, they seemed too big. they were a bit too long (too much space in them) and they are a little wobly side-to-side both on the inside and the heel.they seem wellmade tho. not gonna fall apart on you...i also got knee-high Ellie boots -- and THOSE fit me perfectly and i love them. so it's just THESE ones that are like that.i guess they are good if you have fat calves... or get a size too small? so if you are 6.5 get size 6 -- not size seven!"
4,Black & White Chuck Taylor Heels,"I like these boots so much. They're so stylish and have a decent quality. The only set back that I can think of is that it doesn't have platforms and it will hurt your feet if you'll use it for the whole day. But ALL in ALL, I like these boots so far and I don't have major complaints about it."
3,Mildly interesting,"Mildly interesting video. I had expected a bit more, but this is 30 minutes of a couple of people talking about how cool computers were - in 1980. Nice to see a very young Richard Stallman, and other notorious hackers (Steve Wozniak, Andy Hertzfeld), but all in all a low value video..."
3,A short but interesting look at the mentatilty of hacking in the 80's,"This is a very old program, not a modern retrospective of hacking. Hackers was made from point the view of showing present day Hackers as seen in the mid-80s. Much of the show centers on Steve Wozniak and other hardware/software Hackers. There is a sort of interesting Q&A regarding open software and piracy views among the hackers. This program does not glorify illegal activities in any way, it is more about presenting the ""state of hacking"" at that time. From a historical perspective, this show gives modern viewers some insight on the roots of hacking before it became a four letter word."
3,Historical Interviews with Hi Tech Pioneers,Interesting historical interviews with figures important to the high tech industry but the DVD is very brief at 26 minutes.
3,A nostalgic video,"I like the viideo, hearing woz and the old school hackers, what did they think, how did they live their lifes, but I think it could be better if you put some mmm... I don't know... subtitles? and some pics or something about making the movie, or maybe actual interviews with the people of this video, cuase, it's a little long... (26 Mins.) I know this could be better, but it's up to you guys...."
2,"Good, I guess.....","I suppose the product would have been great. THey looked good but I had only worn them for about 5 minutes when I brished a cabinet and they snagged. Not JUST snagged, but snagged and then ran all the way from the thigh to the toes. So they aren't very strong. I guess they weren't made to be actually ""worn"" maybe just put on for short time sex appeal....."
2,Bought for a photoshoot: Worked well,"I bought these for a photoshoot and they served their purpose but in no way would they last. Also, I'm 5'7"" and the crotch of the pantyhose was very low on me no matter how much I stretched/ pulled them up. So they worked in photos because we could pin them and hold them or position myself a certain way but I would never wear them otherwise."
1,Not that great,"I got these and was so excited to try them on, but when I took them out of the package they looked child-sized. I gave it a shot anyways, but I'm 5'78"" and a size 12 and I could not pull these up all the way which was a big disappointment. I was afraid to pull too hard because they are extremely thin. If you are tall or plus-sized these are not for you."
2,Not for tall gals!,"These look SO sexy, but the butt part of the darn things came up to my thighs! I am 6'1 and 140 lbs. My legs and butt are MADE for hosiery like this, but it didn't fit. Also, the entire front is just plain stocking. The nylon is TISSUE-THIN. Like another customer said, these would be great for a photo shoot or a one night romp with someone special, but nothing else."
3,SevenSevenSeven,"If your Tea Reader doesn't have one of these in his desk, you're going to the wrong Palmist! Try Sun Village Inn and Barbecue if you can steal away. Great collection of good-time shibboleths and barbeliths. Get one for your fave rave Baphomet today!"
4,more to it than i thought,"I got this book for my son. Amazon is the most reliable in sending books to a prison. The book contained more information than the review and touched on topics he was interested in. I use Amazon and have had no problems, I love the access to tracking and can ask if the recipient has received their book yet."
5,"A dictionary for the expert, a guide for the beginner.","This book is a dictionary for the art of Gematria, or interpreting numbers as standing for words. This is not an easy pursuit, but this book helps a great deal. The first part is an article on Gematria (which takes its name from the fact that the Hebrew letter Gema, equivalent to Gamma or C/G, stands for the number 3), a basic description of how it works and why it's important. The third part is a dictionary of commonly used Hebrew magickal words, listed by number. The second part is the meat of the work: Liber 777, a magickal dictionary. Here we find that every number from one to 32 corresponds to a particular name, scent, element, tarot card, &c. An experienced magus can use these correspondicies to create a spell more effectively.A warning to beginners: this book will NOT teach you the basics of spellcasting or magick. To learn that, I'd recommend starting, perhaps, with Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki's Ceremonial Magick Workbook."
4,A MUST FOR ALL MAGICKAL WORKERS IN HIGH/CEREMONIAL MAGICK!,"This is the best book of Kabbalistic Correspondences that I know of. No matter how you feel about Crowley, this is a valuable resource as a reference book. I have used this book to create elemental rituals for my wicca practice as well as making talismen for spells. This book is similar to having a dictionary as a reference to write, so you need to have knowledge of magick before you use the information inside. Gematria! Wow! The information on gematria is great and puts a new twist on numerology for those who practice pythagorian numerology as I do. Try analizing your name or a word in both...Awesome!"
1,I pity the trees which gave their lives so this book could see print,"Like anything touched by Crowley, this volume is packed with impenetrable pretension. If understanding it is the key to magic with a ""k,"" I'll stick to the five-letter variety, thank you very much."
5,Occulta Classica!!!,"A book of such magnitude definitely belongs to the shell of all serious student of Magick, it is the Great grandfather of other books concerning gematria . This book is definitely worth any penny in your pocket.Do yourself a favour, buy it! Aleister Crowley's work may be strange and crytic, but trust me, this is one of those works where a good understanding of the Art Magick and English will suffice."
3,Crowley Crowley Crowley,Nice basic yet adequate explanation of gematria in the first chapter of this book but after that it quickly turns into the undecipherable ramblings of Crowley as so many of his books do. His works reference each other so much the only way to completely understand them is to own and read them all at the same time. Definitely would not recommend however the index of Hebrew words and their numerical values at the end of the book earns it 3 blazing stars.
5,777 is a modern grimoire,All the nuts and bolts data needed to create any magical ceremony for any purpose may be found in this book. Crowley's insights into the inner meanings of the various subjects of Qabalah will greatly help any magician work with the literary aspect of the magical tradition. This book is a must for any magical library of any tradition.
2,Disappointed,"As a fan expecting a personal, if not detailed, autobiography of MTM, I came away very disappointed. Most of all, the relationships with Grant Tinker and other husbands/family members were covered at a very matter-of-fact and not intimate level. Most certainly, writing such a treatment is certainly MTM's right, but I came away feeling almost as having read a third-person biography rather than a first-person account of a fascinating life and career."
3,"leaves one longing for ""moore""","I read this book in a sitting,admittedly skimming certain parts.Although I am a big MTM fan, it whetted my appetite without satiating me...there is definitely a vague ""arm's length"" quality to this book noted by previous reviewers...MTM obviously suffered from a lack of connection with either of her parents as well as a lack of any kind of spiritual connection...I found the ""vegetarian"" chapter oddly placed and suspect readers might be more interested in how she keeps such an enviable physique.All that drinking and never a hangover,wow,what a charmed life...it was hard to picture squeaky clean Laura Petrie or Mary Richards smoking like a chimney, too.Although she states she's nothing like her TV characters, in the end the book made her seem a little one-dimensional,like a television actor.I still admire Ms Moore but I think some professional writing help would have greatly improved the quality of this work.True fans will probably enjoy it , but others should pass.."
2,"Superficial, yet interesting","I read every word of this book (in about half an hour) and wish the white space at the end of two or three page ""chapter"" was filled and then some. This is an exceedingly superficial, detached treatment of very personal, sometimes revealing stuff. Yet why do I feel MTM managed to pull it off--telling me her secrets while keeping herself at armslength. Then again, she seems to keep at armslength from herself... There is information about The Dick Van Dyke show, the The MTM Show, MTM's alcoholism, diabetes, pregnancies and marriages, the deaths of her son, sister, and brother, her audience with the pope, her visit to Israel...all these things, yet not very much. Possibly one of the most fascinating lives in modern American entertainment, and so many details left out! Maybe Ms. Levine will write another book--maybe a book about each of the highlights (or lowlights) by themself."
2,Mary Tyler Less,"I'm amazed that this book is being hailed as oneof the best celebrity autobiographies. MTM's bookdoesn't focus on any one thing long enough to beanymore than a glossy look at her career. Themain problem is that the events in her life thatare meant to be sympathetic come off as selfserving. She points to the loss of her brother,sister and son in tragic deaths as events of majorimportance, but she spends more time describing amiscarriage she had than how these people wereimportant to her. Their main imporatance seemsto be the fact that they died, not that theyever lived.The books main strengths are the behind the scenesshow business talk, although I don't MTM isn't akeen enough observer to bring her shows and moviesto life for us. Instead, we get mostly storiesabout how people treated her. A quick, but mostlyempty read."
4,"delightful reading, a must for mary & laura lovers","Loved the book. Made extraordinary change in my life. I read the hardback edition upon its release and have been a vegetarian, animal sensitive person since. ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO MS. MOORE-- CAN'T she do something about the fact that on repeats of mtm show, mary richards is still scene throwing meat in her shopping cart. this small editing might send a major message (longtime fans will notice) and can go a long way in helping people understand the cruelty and inhumanity of how we have traditionally treated animals. would love to know if this can be done please e mail me."
3,Totally average,These units come exactly as promised. They are not the best quality in the world but that's why they are also very cheap. I have had alot of the terminals break after moderate usage. So if this is for serious projects where quality is imperative I'd recommend looking for a better quality pack. If cheap and simple is what you are after there is nothing wrong with this product. Had I made the decision again I would have gone for a better quality product as it's better suited for my application.
1,only got one tape of the entire season,"product was listed as the complete set of season 3, yet I only received 1 tape of the entire season."
2,boring,"I am the biggest Agatha Christie fan, however after reading about 20 of her books, this has to be one of the worst. I struggled to finish it, and agree with the other reviewers. The plot is unclear. Avoid this book."
2,The worst,"That's the worst book of Agatha Christie. When I was reading it I was hoping for a good end, but it didn't happened."
4,intriguing,"The book held my attention...and that's what is important for any reader. She may have written better plots but this one was thoroughly intriguing stuff. In fact I have read it several times over just to recreate the ""Christie Aura'"
1,Terrible,"Picture perfect example of how a completely inane story gets published and read because it's written by a well known author. The plot is meaningless. As with Elephants Can Remember, I strongly advise you to read the last chapter and be done with it."
3,Not up to par for Dame Agatha,"Maybe I'm just not a Tommy & Tuppence fan - it seemed to me that this was a very low-key mystery, took a long time to get off the ground and just wasn't as interesting to me as most of Agatha Christie's other stories."
2,Extremely Weak,"Tommy and Tuppence's final appearance is sadly weak: although Christie endows the couple with considerable charm, the story itself becomes increasingly vague and confused as the novel progresses, and there is no satisfying conclusion to the piece. Avoid this one."
2,Not Christie's Best,"I love Tommy and Tuppence, but this isn't the best book to feature this crime-solving duo. (The best, in my opinion, is ""By the Pricking of My Thumbs""). That said, this is better than some other works and is worth reading for pleasure."
4,Fitting farewell,"I can't believe all the negative reviews of this book! It had me hooked... Tommy and Tuppence have a really sweet relationship. I think Christie just wanted to end their history like she did with Miss Marple and Poirot, both whose last stories were much more involving. This one was about fascism and that angle really held my attention... T&T were always more into espionage than true murder mysteries. Here, they've stayed true to their characters... And their dog Hannibal was a nice touch... Let's remember this was her final book, and to have such a complicated plot from a woman in her 80's is amazing... I never found it dull or confusing. It's mostly about the past and how governments still til this day continue to bury their secrets... The fat yellow man Robinson explains all this before it's over... Personally I thought the whole story was fascinating..."
4,I love this book!,"All of the books in the Tommy & Tuppence series are wonderful. Read them all if you get the chance, you will love them!!"
1,Cold Case,"I was excited to begin my first Agatha Christie book after hearing so much about her. My 1973 hardback was picked up at a book sale. I'm so glad that I read some reviews here to find that this is not representative of her work. The plot has a resemblance to the TV show ""Cold Case"" in that it tries to figure out a crime from the past. However, unlike the TV show, there are no flashbacks; so the past remains removed from the reader. For each clue and discovery that either Tuppence or Tommy make, they seem to communicate it very imprecisely to the other, exactly the opposite of what I would think would make good detective work. I kept hoping that the ending of the book would tie it together. Although there was somewhat of an explanation about who the criminals were in the past and in the present, none of it was particularly clear or interesting. Hannibal the dog was fun. I think I will try to find an earlier work of hers, but my recommendation on this book is to pass. Taxi!"
1,This book could not be more vague,"This book's shortcomings have been pretty thoroughly documented here by other reviewers. I would just like to add that the confusion and boredom is compounded by endless pages of nothing specific being said:""Something has been planned, something was never completely developed.""""Somebody in whose hands it's got has made some adaptation of it.""""And there's some idea that some of the clues could be found in the past.""The reader is never told who planned what, or what was adapted, or really anything interesting at all. Specific details would go a long way in making the plot coherent."
1,I wish I had not read it,"I was truly disappointed by this book. I love Agatha Christie, and have always considered her not only a great mystery writer, but also a marvelous novelist as well. Yet this book probably is the worst of all her writings. (I've read close to 30 of her full-length novel and some short stories so far). So don't ever read this book if you don't want to feel sorry for Agatha or yourself."
1,Atrocious,"Listen to this advice from an hardcore Christie fan: don't read this book. It's such a painful experience to see one of the greatest mystery writers ever getting into - I can't use another word - complete senility. The story (I can't call it a plot) goes nowhere. Characters are wooden, and some excerpts are merely ludicrous. If you really like Christie, be charitable and forget about that sad final opus. She wrote so many excellent things in her earlier years."
2,"Cozy, but a poor mystery","If you want a ""village life"" book, this isn't badly written, but as a mystery it's a loser. Spend your time elsewhere. The (spoiler) ""bad guy"" is never seen before the end, the first chapter is about nothing more than rearranging books, the motivation for mayhem in the present seems rather thin and hard to believe."
1,A disappointment,"The only reason I kept reading this book after the few initial chapters was that its written by Agatha Christie. I have always enjoyed her mysteries but this one was extremely boring and repetitive, wasn't much of a mystery anyway. I love the way Agatha Christie shapes her characters in other books but if one wants to keep admiring her genius, avoid Postern Of Fate."
5,great gem,"I've been listening to this album since I was a kid in the old vynil version.Cannot recall how many times i have played it. I am glad there is a cd version of it. The album has a very uniform structure. Great solos by freddie hubbard, and the overall sound of the horns section is fantastic. Greatly recommended"
3,Decent unit.,Purchased one of these Sony clock radios from Amazon during the fall of 2000. One of a very few that has a cassette player in it. I'm quite satisfied with it. The sound is relatively clear for a unit in this price range. Operates reliably.
1,Couldn't believe this was a Sony product!,"I bought this item for my Grandmother's birthday. She doesn't have any CDs and so she wanted a tape-playing clock radio. I chose Sony for its great reputation and quality. At first glance it was dissapointing. It looks cheap and you would swear that its a knock-off. When my Grandma plugged it in to listen to her tape, it wouldn't play. We tried everything! This is the only time I've been so dissapointed with an online purchase and I can't even return it because I bought it over 30 days ago."
1,broken?,"so i received this as a christmas present and i am experiencing the same problems as the other person about how the display doesnt read anything, the flashlight comes on inconsistently. i am going to have to send it back!"
1,Junk,This is a throwaway piece of trash. It did not work well when it worked at all. It quit working altogether within a few months. Look elsewhere.
2,Silly,"I love astrology and was looking forward to this book. I didn't realize she works only with equal houses. I can live with that. But there are so many references to death, and fatalistic predictions. I was scared to death when I was done with this. Plus she refers to house rulers as ""Lord of the House"" LOL"
2,Disappointing and unprofessional,"For the beginning astrologer, this might be an amusing read. For anyone who is serious about the profession, though, it is sure to disappoint. At least, that's what it did for me. Ms. McCullough claims to have been an editor in a previous career. She apparently forgot her skills while penning this anecdotal, incomplete and inconsequential series of astrological events. It appears that personal experience alone suffices for Ms. McCullough to deduce astrological rules and guidelines for solar returns. The lack of any kind of statistical and scientific foundation of her findings, together with an amateurish writing style, makes this work very hard to swallow. Not worth the effort of ordering. Note to the publisher: get a copy of QuarkXpress and a decent typesetter."
4,motorola car charger.,we bought this motorola car charger as an extra one for the second car. worked well. flexible cord was a great thing as it did not tangle.
1,its the item and not the seller,"the first one i received would not charge my phone. i wrote the seller and she sent me a new one right away. Unfortunately, the second one does not charge without my hand having to hold the charger to the phone. These chargers look like Motorola chargers but they are not. For the first time, i got what i paid for. I'm just going to suck it up, go to the mall and spend 29.99 for a real Motorola car battery charger. Like i stated before, it's the product and not the seller."
5,Dance with wolves,"WE were pleased to find a source at Amazon for ""Dancing with wolves"" It is the same one we wore out years ago. Received in good time. Quality if fine. Thanks."
5,Great Plains captured in music.,I can relax and feel at home with this music from the great plains with the characters and the history of native Americans.
5,John Barry at his best,"This score won an academy award and with good reason. The music is heartfelt, captivating, and leaves you breathless. It is a majestic epic score with stirring themes that make it a true classic. The main theme titled ""The John Dunbar Theme"" is a dramatic sequence with gorgeous string lines. It appears in several other places throughout the score. There are also adventurous parts in the score as an addition. ""Pawnee Attack"", ""Journey to Fort Sedgewick"", ""Ride to Fort Hays"", and ""The Buffalo Hunt"" contain bold brass lines along with the usual strings and percussion. I really don't have much to say about this one because it is so good. Just buy it and take a listen. The music will describe itself."
3,Ques and SACD notes,"This is a question and not a review. Is this disc multi-channel or just stereo?For the guys that were complaining about getting this disk and not being able to play it on their cd, if you had looked further down the page (after searching for John Barry) you would have seen the standard cd. Amazon should probably do a better job of letting you know that you are ordering a SACD and make you acknowledge that before processing the order. Also, some SACDs will play on normal cd players. They're labelled as Hybrid disks meaning they will play on SACD players and on CD players."
2,"SACD, but NO surround sound","Very nice music - nothing wrong with that.But.... this is a stereo CD. It has SACD written all over it and my new Denon DVD-3910 DVD player does recognise this as an SACD, but it only has 2 channels, instead of 5.1. I do own several other SACD's and these DO play 5.1 channel. Very strange....So perhaps it's smarter to order the Stereo CD, the one with the special bonus tracks (Dances with Wolves (Special Extended Edition)."
1,SACD????,"I would love to purchase and listen to this Soundtrack but it seems that a entirely new piece of hardware is required just to listen to it. Why in the world do we need another CD format and why isnt this disc available on a regular CD also?? This kind of myopic marketing just amazes me...I want the soundtrack, have the money to buy it, as many others do no doubt, but I cant play it if I buy it. I cant think of many things more irritating than wanting to make a purchase and being told ""Nope, you cant have it""."
2,Disappointed & Cheated,"The main reason I purchased this CD was in the hope that in contained a superb piece, incorporating at least two the pieces, from the CD, into one that John barry created to promote the video of this film. I can be seen in the trailers of the video Wild at Heart ( Aust Release ), it is both stirring piece of Music and a video of the film cut to together with behind the scenes of the same scene. It is not on this CD and I don't believe it has been released more's the pity. It is a wonderful piece so I all I could do is create my own copy from the promotional version. This should've been on the CD and only listened to the CD twice and have not again."
5,Dances With Wolves Review,"Everything was sent to me in perfect condition, within four days. The CD sounds great as it was brand new and still in the package. My family and I will definitely look toward Amazon.com for future purchases not only for the GREAT prices, but also because of the quickness of service."
5,This is a classic!,"I loved this music when I saw the original film debut, and this 2nd version of the CD is a wonderful treatment to a fantastic soundtrack. It is crystal clear from a production standpoint. The music itself is full-on stirring, dramatic, and moving, depending on the cut. You can see in your mind's eye the beautiful plains scenery, the brutal indian attack, the courting and falling in love between Dunbar and Stands-With-Fist, and the majestic buffalo when you play the corresponding track. You can also appreciate that John Barry does not get enough credit as a wonderful screen composer -- this is one you've got to own!"
3,kinda goofy,I recieved my CD and it did not work so i ask to return it. Then...they ask for its size and weight(like i had scales and then had to measure a CD) and they also ask for the ISBN number as if it was a book. I am not sure they knew what they sent me as it came from a 3rd party. None the less it all worked out and I recieved another CD that worked just fine. They were a tad automated. I would buy again.
3,Music,"The music is wonderful, the only bad experience I had was I requested a new cd and seller sent me a used cd. that was disappointed."
3,Dances With Wolves (SOUNDTRACK),"Loved some of the music but some I didn't. The theme song was the reason I purchased it, of course I knew that the movie soundtrack would be included."
4,Familiar music with good performance,This CD contains many familiar music from films and the performance of the musicians is very good particularly track 16. I also find the music very relax and enjoyable and can bring the memory of those films if one has ever seen them.
2,Poor Quality,"My grandmother gave this to me last year, and I loved it. It tarnished quickly, and when I tried to clean it, the black coloring in the word engraving came off. Pretty bracelet in the box."
3,Snore....,"Saying that Jessica won a Grammy doesn't mean too much here. Idon't think Grammy voters know music from their ( ). I suppose theypicked it since it was a well known tune by the ABB. Be warned, this version of Jessica trudges on like a limp mule. The original studio version is much, much better.While this is by far not the best ABB you can buy live, I will say this, the acoustic verion of Liz Reed on this disc is one of the most amazing things I have ever heard them do. The rest of the disc is ok, but Liz Reed is reason alone to get this disc. The interplay between Dickey, Warren and Alan is superb.First Set is much better than this disc, so if you are looking for recent ABB, that is a good place to go. END"
2,Definitely the weakest live ABB album,"The Allmans have pulled off a serious comeback in the last 10 years, but I'd hate to have 2nd Set be someone's first live taste of the band. Jay Mark's mixing effort managed to bury Gregg Allman's keyboards on most songs. Then there's Soulshine -- why on earth would the band pick a version where drummer Jaimoe is a half-step BEHIND the beat for the entire song?? And why make 4 of the 8 tracks simply re-hashes from the last studio album?? Three songs do make the album salvageable -- the glorious accoustic Liz Reed, a shorter, funky, energetic You Don't Love Me (Warren Haynes' slide solo is AMAZING), and the fabulous cover of Willie Dixon's The Same Thing."
4,Documents the great 1990s version of the ABB,"This is another great live CD from the Allman Bros Band. The ABB have done an allusive thing in the 90s- match old time glory in the reunion years. The acoustic Elizabeth Reed is worth the price of admission alone - some of the best jazz guitar work ever recorded. Although I will always miss Chuck Leavell's piano on Jessica, this is a harder rockin, memorable version that was nominated for a Grammy. The song selection is a bit odd in that 4 songs from the previous studio album appear when that record was recorded ""live"" in the studio. The better version of No One to Run With definitely appears on the Where It All Begins album, but all songs are top notch (Soulshine is a beautiful bluesy ballad) and will give you a feel for how powerful the ABB have been in concert in the 1990s."
5,Amazing!,"To say that The Allman Brothers Band is the best jam-band in the universe is an understatement!!I urge you people, who doesen't know them, to check them out. This is what music is all about: A band who jams while on stage, a band who doesen't have any limitations to what you can do during the songs, a band that love what they do so much that you can ""hear"" them smile while you listen to their cd's. The best part is: They are still out there doing their thing with the same personell (except Dickey Betts) as on this cd, they have just released a new, fantastic studioalbum called Hittin' The Note and a new livealbum called No Way Out (live from the Beacon Theatre in New York).This is what true music is all about- don't miss out on it!!!"
4,You've got to hear this version of Eliz Reed!,"I think the last person meant ""Soulshine"" not Southbound, which is on An Evening with the Allman Brothers.As far as 2nd Set goes, I don't care too much for Sailin Cross the Devil's Sea and this version of the normally excellent No One to Run With is sloppy and the Bo-Diddley licks aren't as sharp as the 1994 original. Other than that, this CD is just smokin. Soulshine, Back Where It All Begins, You Don't Love Me (better than the drawn out 1971 version), Jessica, Same Thing, and the spectacular acoustic Elizabeth Reed will show you why the Allmans are such a popular live act still today.Warren Haynes and Dickey Betts are a talented guitar tandem that have heavily influenced the young jam bands of today. And while I really like this CD, I would recommend getting An Evening with the Allman Brothers first, but GET BOTH."
2,Grammar errors in a National Book Award Title?,"Maybe I'm just a permanent English teacher, but the plethora of comma splices and run-on sentences just left me cold. I agree with the reviewer who criticized the way the narrative jumps around in seemingly random fashion; there is no depth to the story. However, even beyond that, when I read a novel, I'm looking for good writing. I didn't find that here."
4,This book is being under-rated by the reviewers!,"This book is far better than an average review of 2 stars! I thought it was a very elegant book, with a cast of characters that bring Paraguay alive. It is short, so it moves quickly. And it really runs the gamut with the plot. There is romance, war, death, betrayal, birth, Europe, Latin America. Moreover, I learned something about Paraguayan history, I had no idea it was this shocking.I would warn readers that though the back of the book says it's in the vein of Vargas Llosa and Garcia Marquez, I don't think that's an accurate comparison...simply because it takes place in Latin American doesn't mean it's in the vein of Latin American authors."
1,The Bad News From Paraguay,"I absolutely agree with the reviewers who were baffled by this novel's receipt of the National Book Award. ""The News from Paraguay"" is a one-dimensional, extremely violent narrative about a slice of Paraguayan history. The main characters, the dictator who plunges his country into war, and his Irish wife, a sort of Marie Antoinette figure, who longs for adventure so long as it comes with the trappings of Parisian society, are implausible, wooden and superficially realized. This could have been a great novel of historical fiction, like ""Year of Wonders,"" but the author is content to give us a bloody Fodor travelogue. In sum, this novel is easy to dismiss, and unfortunately for Ms. Tuck, the news from Paraguay is very bad indeed."
1,What WAS she thinking?,"Lilly Tuck grabbed a couple of wonderful historical figures and has written a truly wretched novel. Francisco Solano Lopez and Eliza Lynch were the Paraguayan power couple who looted shamelessly and drove their poor country to near total destruction in the 1860's. Their story will make a fine book some day, alas that day is not today. Tuck has given us wooden cut-outs where real people should be, a story with loose ends and meaningless sub-plots and don't even get me started on her silly sex scenes. In sum, don't even think of wasting your time on this book."
3,What's happened to the National Book Award?,"I expected so much from this book and purposely did not read any other customer reviews before picking it up. This was highly disappointing. The descriptions of life in 19th century Paraguay could have been gleaned from surfing the Internet, the characters were one-dimensional. The style, episodic and random, was distracting, not original, if originality was the purpose. I so wanted to like this book since I've been puzzled by the finalists the National Book Award has chosen lately. But it did not deliver."
1,ignorant and boring,"the author is obviously racist yet trying to make her character enjoy her surroundings. it's also obvious that the author has never been to paraguay and that relaxing to her is lazy. why did anyone tell this woman she wrote a good book? all her information came from foreigners to paraguay... not paraguains directly. if you want to read about paraguay accuratly, don't read this book."
3,Off to the Untamed Wilds,"""The News from Paraguay"", is historical fiction, but with a great emphasis on the history. Now I must confess that Paraguay is Terra incognito for me, or was before I began this book about one of the major events in the development of that country. If you can picture a glamorous woman from mid-1800s Paris leaving behind her friendships with royalty there, to go off to the untamed wilds of South America, then you understand this book's appeal. Yes there is a goodly amount of violence, as in wars and the other things that go on when a person is bound and determined to take over a country--so be forewarned. As other reviewers have said there is perhaps too much emphasis on sex; certainly that aspect of the story could have been downplayed, suggested, or omitted. But there is also romance, enduring love amid great odds. So I found it fascinating reading."
2,Gratuitous Violence!!,"I am surprised that in the editorial and customer reviews no one was disturbed by the over-the-top violence: blood, beheadings, dismemberings, starvings, tortures, impalements, rapes, destruction and so on that multiply on every page, with little literary merit. Why would an accomplished author present this to a National Book reading audience? One reads about the horrors of war, but this book goes beyond in gratutitous torture and killing of every person who comes on the scene (except for Ella and 50% of her children). We swoon over her golden elegance and wade into the blood outside. If the point is to show the horrors of greed and war, the telling is too flat and removed to make us care about the individuals, but, instead, we turn away in disgust."
2,Not good,"When I saw the logo of the National Book Award, I assumed that I would be purchasing a good read. I was wrong.The writer's snappy, unrealistic writing style failed to capture my attention.I'll go back to reading Pulitzer Prize winners like THE KNOWN WORLD-- an outstanding work of historical fiction deserving the prestige that a national award brings to it."
1,"I will never listen to reviews, except amazon customers","I too purchased this book based on critic reviews (NY Times for one). It stinks. Even if it is not accurate..I believe it is poorly written and belongs more in the urban girl genre i.e. Sex in the City"" than in historical fiction. I am very disappointed, I will stick to Isabel Allende and authors like her if I want to read about South America."
5,Great tunes for the price,I love a lot of the songs on this cd. It was a great price and arrived quickly. I buy used cd's from Amazon all the time. I have never had a problem. Plus I am not pirating music. Artists need to get paid. Highly recommended it especially if you are replacing cd's that have gone missing.
2,OTHER THAN CECE PENISTON'S CONTRIBUTION...,"... with her David Morales remix of ""Keep Givin' Me Your Love"", a beat-heavy, pop-perfect confection that is criminally absent from her best-of compilations, everything else is forgettable tripe."
3,Looks beautiful but the cushions are not up to the mark,"First of all, the entire set looks beautiful. We had purchased this set for our guest bedroom and we were happy with the colors. The bed skirt,comforter and pillow cases look fabulous in our guest bedroom.However the packaging was not upto the mark. The cushions were pretty crushed when delivered, and being cushions it was not easy to get them into the shape. We haven't managed to get them to into proper shape even now. The comforter is not as thick as we hoped it would be. During peak north east winters even with decent heat in the house, one would need something in addition to this comforter.Overall, we would recommend this set only if you are purchasing it for occasional use (when it needs to look more beautiful, then strictly useful)."
3,Cheap materials & construct,Echo what the previous reviewer said: This is ok for guest use from time to time... Bought 2 sets and gave both away. Very cheap quality. Don't let the savings number fool you. The cushions are cute.
1,King Comforter that doesn't quite fit.,"I think the comforter itself is beautiful, however it must be for a VERY small king bed!"
2,Poor Support,"I got an error trying to install this card. I do this for a living so I ought to be able to install a simple PCI card. But not this time. I spent the extra money on the name-brand card because I read about the Adaptec Support from other reviewers. Well first, their website was useless. The suggestions they had were'nt even close. Then I decided to talk to a live person - but wait! You need a credit card and have to pay $10 for phone support. So I e-mailed a detailed description of the problem to them. After 48 hours, no reply. I found a MS KB article that told me exactly how to fix the problem."
4,Very sturdy and beautiful!,"I recieved this lamp as a gift and it is really lovely on my cherry wood desk - the brown hues in the base would match most woods. The shade arrived broken - but was quickly replaced. The pattern doesn't show in the pic above, it's a neutral tan/ivory swirled glass pattern - some call it Alabaster. Two bulbs switch on/off via pull chains. That works well for me because the outlet is switched at the wall so I usually leave only one bulb on for room light and switch the second on when I am working.... you won't be disappointed. This is a quality built lamp.... they didn't scrimp on details."
5,Good quality for the price!,I just wanted to buy something for my theme party that would at least last throughout the party but the quality of the flag surpassed that for the price.
4,Confederate Battle Flag,"This is a good flag to display, as on a wall or other protected place. If one wishes to fly it outside, it may soon fray at the unattached border if there is more than a bit of wind."
4,Great indoor decoration,"I bought this flag to hang on my wall. It has served this purpose to a T. Its made of a thin, translucent polyester that I'm not sure is suitable for outdoor use, but works just fine in my home."
3,As expected,The Flag arrived on time and was exactly how I thought it would be I bought it for inside my garage it is too light for me to fly outside. I will be buying a heavier flag for outside use.
2,Get what you pay for,"I ordered this on request from a customer who I'm building a gun case for and wow is this thing of the lowest quality. It's so thin you can see through it, immediately after unboxing it is already getting loose threads that got caught on the cardboard box and pulled even looser. I told the customer I would cover the cost of a better quality flag because I'm not putting this thing in my work. It's that bad. But at the price I should have known better."
4,not bad but little rough,"I ordered this flag and a soviet flag as well, however the shipping was over priced.The flag i got has a small rip in it and the brass rings fell out. Overall the flag is big and still hangs"
3,It's actually very thin nylon,"It came very badly creased and folded - the material was so thin, I was afraid to iron it. I didn't want it to melt or burn.."
4,Decent flag for the price,I bought two of these flags. Really wanted a nicer confed. flag but couldn't find one. Decent quality.
4,Good for the price...,"I ordered the flag to hang in my garage. When I received it and opened it up, it was a cheap looking flag but for the purpose I had purchased it for it was a great flag for a wall hanger. I would not recommend flying this flag outdoors or on a vehicle due to how thin the flag is. But overall 4 out of 5."
5,GOOD FOR SHOT TERM USE,I will order again. Like the rich colors and look. They look very good. I think the price is fair.
3,Flag of the South,This flag is much as what you are probably expecting for the price. If your not to concerned with having a heavy well made item this will work for you.
1,Wrong Flag :(,"The flag would have been alright if they had sent me the correct flag. I asked for the Confederate Flag but was sent a British Flag instead (in the clear package that clearly stated Confederate Flag). Didn't return the British Flag, and gave it to another person instead of who it was intended for. I'll probably reorder a Confederate Flag, but probably not from this distributor."
4,decent,"very thin, but you great price and free shipping, more than enough value. I ordered this as a joke to decorate my dorm room, then the day after i taped this on my wall, a black repairman knocked on my door because he mistakenly thought my sink needed servicing. I freaked out when i opened the door, and i told him one second and closed the door on his face and ripped it down, i then opened the door and came in, he inspected the sink and left. that was a close one, i could have gotten my a$$ kicked."
5,Loss of a Love,"Although this book was written I think more for love in a relationship loss than the loss I am presently going through, the sentiment expressed throughout the book applied to all losses of those we love. It has been very helpful to me."
4,one partner in relationship left,This book is more about how to continue after one partner in a relationship left. It has very little to say about how to cope when one partner dies. I did find a few ideas in it. Can be read in an hour or less.
5,Excellent source of emotional pain relief,"My younger sister gave this to me 15 years ago when I was going through of very painful divorce. She was reluctant to give a book to me and told me so. However, the type of book it is gives you little bits of stuff to hold onto as you go through the emotional roller coaster of losing someone you love, be it from divorce or death.I have purchsed several copies of this book over the past years to help others. There were days I didn't know how I was going to get out of bed. So, I'd pick it up and skim through it and it really made a difference.My latest purchase was form the widower of the sister that first bought it for me. She died of leukemia at only age 50 in April 2007. I thought that perhaps if he knew she had bought this book for me, that it would also help him.I recommend that one keeps extra copies for those times when we don't know quite what to say to someone who is hurting. This book says it for us."
3,Quick Helpful Book,"This book is very entertaining to read and is very applicable to almost any loss. It's got quick little sections to read, as well as longer explanatory messages to help you understand your grief."
5,Excellent book for those hurting.,"I read this book after the end of a long-term relationship and turn to it whenever I seem to lose hope in love. I have recommended this book to others and want to say that it really helps when live seems bleak. This book will remind you that you will heal, things will get better, and you will love again."
1,How to Survive the Loss of a Love,"I have never been so disappointed in purchasing books that I have owned in the past as I have been with this book!! I have probably bought about 20 copies of this book over the last 20ish years. This used to be a wonderful book, now it is nothing but advertisements for other books about similar topics. There is not even mention of the loss of a phone call in there. Not only will I never purchase this book again, but I will also quit referring it to people that have loss in their lives. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"
5,Extremely Useful,"I recently had an unexpected loss of a person I loved. I was truly in more pain than I ever had been in my entire life. Fortunatly I stumbled accross this book and was helped enormously. Its practical, simple, and will help you through the grief process. Heart Ache is the worse pain I know and you dont have to go through it alone and without help. Pick up this book and begin healing.Highly recommended for anyone in the grieving process."
5,Compassionate & Pragmatic,"I was extremely fortunate to find this book while I was going through a horrible divorce. How to Survive The Loss of a Love is easy to read, logical and at the same time deeply compassionate. I have shared this book with several friends. I highly recommend it."
3,Poetry in Grief and Loss,"I originally purchased the book because I thought it was a ""self help"" book on how to move on from grief and loss. Instead the book was the author's journey and poetry, with meditations and some advice on how to handle the emotions, which mainly consisted of 'dwell with them.' The poetry is superb. The meditations are good. The advice is ok. I rated this book kind of average mostly because the title led me to believe it was more a 'self help' book. But as a book for what it is, it's fairly good."
5,"So far, the finest of its kind that I've found.","As a Social Worker who has dealt with hundreds of deaths due to cancer, AIDS, and the rest, I have recommended this ""Little First Aid Kit"" to numerous spouses, families and friends. It deals well, and realistically, with all sorts of losses. It was given to me by a therapist as I was grieving a sudden and horrible divorce, and helped me immensely. I now prescribe it to many who are beginning the terrible process of dealing with severe loss. In a word, ""Wonderful."" The poetry is touching, funny, and right on the money."
5,Great Therapy Book,This book is an excellent opportunity for someone who has suffered a lost to understand how to keep their life in order. Pleased to find this book for our friend that needed the help.
2,Healing Book for the Grieving,"This book was given to me in '93 when my mother died. I lost my father in 2009 and ordered it again. I had shared my '93 version with so many friends and finally it did not return. It once again helped me heal. Its passages are short and heart-felt. Short is good because when you are grieving, you can't concentrate. I recently met a woman who had just lost her beloved mother, and I took the book to her. It is the best gift you can give someone who has suffered ""the loss of love' whether it's death, divorce etc. Better than flowers or memorials."
5,This book was there for me when nothing else was.,"I have shared this book with friends, family, and acquaintances all over the country. It gets directly to heart of the matter, and is written so that if one page is all you can get through, one page is all you need. I had been referring to my first edition copy for all types of losses for years, when I lost my beloved brother three years ago. I found myself drifting, unable to focus, and this book went everywhere with me. It was the perfect ""friend"" when I needed one most. The first time I read the book I learned that grief can happen over any loss, and found that I was exactly where I was ""supposed"" to be each step of the way. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Melba Cosgrove, et. al.!"
5,Words for the heartbroken,"This book puts all of those horrible crushing thoughts and feelings into words. It speaks to your heart in a deeply profound way. I broke down reading this book and cried more than I think I ever have before. But while I felt beaten and exhausted, I also felt relieved that so many of my catastrophic thoughts were laid out, flat, honest, and undeniable.My doctor recommended this book to me, and I am certain I will refer to it again and again."
4,Good Insight,This book gave me some fresh insights as to how to deal with a difficult time that arises in everyone's life. It helped me to have a new perspective on the healing phases after a breakup. I also found it encouraging and humorous.
2,How To Survive The Loss of A Love,"I truly enjoyed the little poems inside but the book made me cry and cry all that day. I'm not sure it is very helpful or if something that makes you cry is good for you so you can just let it all out and feel better afterwards. I haven't read all of it yet, but I probably will. Good luck to anyone else in this situation and God Bless."
3,a comfort and solace,"I read this book years ago but purchased it for a friend going through a period of loss. I recommend it as one tool to help people grieve; while not every page rang with truth for myself, I do think people can find some solace in it. It's a great book to skim through and find pages that provide direction or support in particular moments of grief, I went back through the book one year after I received it as a gift and found new perspectives and ideas on managing my sadness."
5,A big help,This is a wonderful book. I had read it before years ago but it was a big help this time too
5,Fabulous,"I learned of this book from a talk given by Dr. David Bruner of the Center for Spiritual Living in San Jose, CA on June 10, 2012. I lost my brother and my Mother in the past year, and he so highly recommended this book that I purchased it. I love it. It helps."
5,Most Helpful,"Whether you have lost a loved one by divorce, break up or if they have passed away, this book will help you through those tough times. Easy to read, short chapters that explain the feelings you have and how to get on with life.I regularly buy this book for friends and acquaintances going through grief.A most helpful little book."
5,Read this book and give one to a good friend in need,"I found ""How to Survive the Loss of a Love"" to be very comforting in my time of need. The text gave me a solid perspective and a sense of hope at a time when I wasn't thinking clearly. Many of the poems express thoughts and feelings that are so close to my own that they bring immediate solice. The book is short and reads very quickly - just perfect for someone whose mind is focussed on their pain and thus isn't in a mood for deep concentration. I recommend buying one for yourself and another one for a friend."
5,This is the most important book I have ever owned.,"I was faced with a sudden loss when my fiance suddenly (phone call at 3:30am) ended our engagement for another woman he had met. I can't explain the shock and hurt that I felt. I didn't know what to do, and was frantically searching for something to ease my agony. I happened to be at the local library, and found a worn and used copy of this book. This book was a gift from God, and I don't know what I would have done without it. I had to eventually return the book, and buy one of my own. Within this book, it contained everything that I was feeling, as if the authors knew me. I have since given my original copy to a friend in need, and have of course bought a replacement. The book helped me deal with and understand the pain that I was going through, and opened my eyes to the fact that it will get better, and that the pain does not last forever."
5,How to Survive the Loss of a Love,"I am a Police Officer and I have given this book out to many people over many many years. In every case, they have advised me that it came at the exact right time and it was the exact right book."
4,Please get this for anyone mourning a loss,"This book is for anyone who is mourning a loss.........I know 3 women who lost their husbands and this book was some help to them. They all said they read it a few times over, and it was a little help on those sleepless nights. While there is nothing we can say during these times of loss, this little book seems to help the person realize that what they are feeling is normal, and that there are stages to mourning. It cannot fix anything, but it does seem to help. Please purchase it for anyone who is experincing a loss."
5,Compassion in a book,"I have gifted this little gem to many friends who had a bereavement, and it has helped them as it helped myself. Simply put and cathartic, like an understanding listener in times that it is so hard to express yourself.Give Him Back His Balls"
3,"Cute pictures, cheap looking cards","I'm a boxer lover so I ordered these b/c the pictures were too cute! The pictures are adorable, so if you are looking for some boxer themed cards and can't find any others, these would work. HOWEVER, the actual cards are pretty cheap looking. They are small cards and the front of the cards have a matte, almost notebook paper-y finish to them, not your typical 'card' appearance like you would find if you picked up a card at hallmark. I will say the paper they are printed on makes them look pretty cheap as its pretty flimsy - almost similar to if you printed a card off on your home computer using regular printer paper (good thing the cute pictures are there to distract you from the quality of the card!). Same goes for the envelopes they come with, very cheap looking, paper thin. But again, the boxers sure are cute!"
5,La Dolce Vita,"A fun book, full of colour, beauty-made-simple and the good life. I wish I had time and money to live in-between the pages. Fekkai's lust for life springs from every page. The photos are beautiful, some delicious easy-to-prepare recipes and something to share with your girl-friends.Just do it!"
4,Beautiful and inspirational,"This is a very beautiful book. I would recommend anyone who spend money on fashion magazines to spend those money on books like these instead. They are durable and are not ageing as fast as magazines. The book contains many inspirational pictures, and many good tips about style, how to be chic, grooming etc. However, this is not an ""how to""-book. If you look for more detailed tips on how to plan your wardrobe etc., look elsewhereThe book is divided in chapters after the months of the year. Therefore, it is a book you can come back to all the time. It is best enjoyed browsed through with a cup of tea or similar. I especially liked the little notes in the margins - tips on how to make your life more beautiful and chic. Many of them refer to things to buy, but many refer to things that are simple and inexpensive."
3,Don't take too seriously,"This is a well written/illustrated book about east-coast (NYC) style, not styel of the Rocky Mountains or Pacific Coast. While the author does offer many worthy hints to pull one's self together, he misses the boat on voluptuousness and womanliness leaning more toward uni-sex, understated style. Read it for the tips to get yourself together, but don't forsake being a woman because Fekkai downplays bodaciousness and the art of being a bombshell. (For example, he notes one should not be intimidated by the curvy blonde because behind her back people are calling her a bimbo)."
2,Platitudes with Attitude,"The photography and models are gorgeous -- the format of the book is inviting. Content is another story - I was very disappointed. The author shines a little in his area of expertise - hair styling, but not much. I suppose this world-reknown hair expert is saving the real tips for his paying salon customers. Ditto for skin and beauty ""tips"" in this book. The only tip I got from the book was the use of pure shea butter to condition hair. More of this kind of information would have made this book much much better. As for a the subject of style, Mr. Fekkai's overall mantra is ""less is more"" (boring) -- except of course, if you're a celebrity or society person -- then you break this rule and Mr. Fekkai still calls it style. The verdict: be beautiful, young/wrinkle-less, thin; wear and decorate with neutral colors and you will be stylish. Being rich and famous doesn't hurt either."
3,Please learn to do arithmatic,"I recieved this book recently and read it from cover to cover. Although the writer did give some good advice on makeup and style but he wrote for not the general public but the women in million dollar club. I wonder if he bother to do the arithmatic of his advices and calculated that an ordinary woman with children can afford frequent spa treatments, weekly manicures and blowdrys at expensive salons plus frequent mini gateaway to tropics or south of France. I find some time this lack of consideration on author's part annoying at times. Scot Fitzgerald when stated that the rich are different from you and me, he was merely stating the facts but when a book was written for general public than it should be geared towards them. I did bought the soaps you mention in your book and they are splendid."
5,SUCH A SPIRITED SISTA!,"Kia ora koutou katoaAnika Moa is truly a talented and beautiful young vocal, who also shines with a lyrical pen.Her debut album ""Thinking Room"", is a work of pure magic and soothes the ear with captivating words.I recommend ""Youthful"", ""Good In My Head"", ""Flowers For You"" and of course the track from American Sweethearts - ""Falling In Love Again"".Arohanui"
4,A 'Who's Who' in Heresy,"I bought this book back in the late 70's when I was a new believer, and wanted to know all about the current cults, and what they believe. I recommend this if you want to read a quick overview on the major religions on the scene, many of which you may not be familiar with.It is presented with a bit of humour, but divided into sections, for example christian-based cults and eastern ones. The author briefly describes the background and teachings of religions of the past decades from the christian point of view, and how they stand in light of bible doctrine.Some may have faded from the scene by now, but this is full of interesting history, as many new movements are based on earlier heresies. It is a good idea for God's people to be up on traps being set by the enemy of our souls!"
3,Five Mile Creek series,"I've been trying to watch this series for about 20 years. First, by rented video and now by buying volumes that I can find. I would love the opportunity to watch the entire season, in order, at least once. It's a great story, but it's never been popular enough to be readily available. I enjoyed this volume as much as any of the others I've seen, but I've been forced to view them in bits and pieces, out of order and have never seen the complete set."
3,Just Ok,I heard these guys interviewed on NPR so I bought this CD. I didn't enjoy the CD as much as the interview. Just OK.
3,"Good design, BUT!","Hi, I owned couple of those kettles for few years and it works great. Good design, fast heating... But BE AWARE that after a year or so of everyday use it will start LEAKING on the bottom. First I thought it's just one case, but when that happened with 3 of them in the row... Now when third one starting to leak I will be looking at some other brand. I would think for that price quality should be better!"
5,I'm impressed,"Get rid of your old-fashioned stovetop kettle that boils dry and collects all that unsightly cooking grime. This electric kettle is just fabulous. It is very fast, especially if you need only a few cups, and it safely shuts off when it reaches a boil. It decants the hot water without dripping or other annoyances. It looks quite nice on the counter as well. The controls seem to be in just the right place. I looked at several models in a store and this one had the best overall design. The price may seem a tad high but I think it is well worth it."
1,This leaked.,"I did read the several reviews that stated this leaked but as the majority of people loved this kettle I went ahead and purchased it. Used it once, left it overnight with the remainder of the water in it and the next morning all of the water had leaked through the bottom all over the counter. Not great at all for one of the most expensive kettles here on Amazon. I have a plastic Braun already which has been going strong for over 4 years. This looks great but clearly has design issues. Pain to have to send it back and start again."
2,Breaks after about a year of use.,"I bought this kettle because I liked the look of it and I had cheaper versions of Braun kettles before and was happy with them. Apart from the fact the kettle is extremely heavy and gets really hot - it was ok while it was working. Suddenly the connection to the base started working intermittently, i would have to press down on the kettle or rotate it back and forth until the heat indicator would lit up. And eventually it broke completely. Definitely not worth the money!"
1,VERY DANGEROUS,"Braun WK600 Impressions 7-Cup Cordless Tea KettleI am a tea junkie and wanted a stainless electric tea pot. After only 2 months of use this tea pot began to leak, and leak and leak from the base. This is extremely dangerous for an electric product. I returned it for a new one because I trust the brand and liked the kettle--also thinking it was a fluke. The new pot leaked the second time I used it--even more so than the first. Like an idiot I tried again and purchased my 3rd Braun WK600--again, this one began to leak the second or third time I used it. Their customer sercvice was of no use. I have since read all the reviews and see there are several complaints regarding leakage. Save yourself the trouble and get a different pot--I am going to see who I notify to have the product recalled before someone gets electricuted!"
4,Works great. Useful cord storage. Well thought-out features.,"Other reviewers have already talked about how good the kettle looks and how fast it boils, and how easy it works.Like to also highlight that you can wind the power cord underneath the base so that you pull out only the necessary length of cord to the wall socket. This is very useful since the power cord is necessarily quite thick (in order to pull in 1500 Watts for that quick boil) and is way too thick and stiff to wrap into a bundle using your regular twist-n-turn wire strips.On top of that, the kettle when sitting on top of the powering base can rotate 360 degrees, so you can place the base anywhere relative to wall socket to reduce exposed cord. The product manual says this should the chance of little kids pulling on the cord or the kettle getting tripped over, but I'm just glad it reduces kitchen clutter.Well worth the money."
2,"Kettle leaks after 9 months; also, very noisy","This kettle replaced an old plastic Braun kettle that 'died' after many years.This new kettle worked OK for 9 months - although was much noisier than any electric kettle I'd ever heard before (and having lived in England for 25 years, I have heard many kettles!).However, this morning (with the kettle 9 months old) - the kettle is leaking water at the bottom of the kettle where the stainless steel at attached to the black plastic at the base of the kettle. Very disappointing.I have contacted Braun customer service - let's see what they say."
2,It Leaks,"I used to love this electric kettle. It heated water fast, and it seemed solid. At this high price, I expected it to last for 10 years or more (our clothes washer and dryer have lasted over 25 years). I don't recall exactly when we bought this Braun electric kettle, but I believe it was about two years ago. Now it leaks from the bottom. This is unacceptable for a WATER HOLDING product. I'm now looking for another cordless electric kettle."
1,Review after owning for 3 years - Hazardous,"I thought I would write a review on this tea kettle after owning for 3 yrs. I did like this tea kettle very much and in all this time it has always heated up quickly. However, when one spends the amount of money this kettle is it should last for a long time. Mine started leaking as others have complained. It is leaking at the base where the electric plate is located and it was entirely wet as others have described. It seems to happen on mine when you want more then 2 cups of water. I am replacing it and thought about spending the money and repurchasing this same pot, however, if others are complaining of the same problem - there must be a flaw somewhere and electric and water don't mix well. Therefore, I will purchase another brand. To bad I would have given this pot a 5 star."
2,Plastic Leaching,"It heats up water pretty really fast. The problem is there are plastic rivets (for the handle and water level window) inside of boiling chamber. All plastic leaches, especially with hot liquid. I've not used this kettle in years, and have replaced it with a all glass stove-top kettle. The glass one is a lot slower, but no leaching."
3,"Not bad, but not durable","We've had this kettle for about 3-4 years and it has worked flawlessly. However, it just stopped working and I'm guessing it's going to be cheaper to buy a new one than repairing this one (I don't plan to buy the same model).A few minor gripes:1. The water indicator is difficult to read2. It's heavy (add the full weight of water and it's very heavy)3. The electrical cord could stand to be 6"" longer.But apparently ours was not Braun durable."
1,"Don't buy, not worth it","Got it about 1 year ago. First some contact got loose and had to turn it this way and that so it would stay on. Then a couple of days ago lots of smoke came out the base and it died all together. The filter screen came off a while ago. not really needed anyway. I don't know why the price is so high, I paid much less. this was the second one in a row that did not last over a year. will not buy again. Stay away from this POS."
1,Kettle good Etronics bad,"TRUE STORY:I had trouble making a purchase on amazon via etronics because they shipped me the wrong item. When all was said and done I got, finally, the product I ordered and paid for. HOWEVER when I was asked to write a review, which I did, honestly I must add. Etronics was less than pleased and contacted me to apologize for the mistake. I told them no problem and they insisted on compensating me in some way, here's the good part, AS LONG AS I REMOVED MY NEGATIVE REVIEW. Does anyone out there know the going rate for review removal? NO? Neither did I. I found out thanks to Mr. Landau that it could go up to $100. Good thing I didn't remove the review. Mr. Landau didn't come through.I know two thing for sure, it was the very first time doing business with both amazon and etronics and secondly there won't be a second time for either of them."
1,WK600 electric kettle not durable for use,"This kettle only has one year useage life. After used for a year, it became leaking and it is not safe to use any more. No warranty and no repair. I am very disappointed about this product."
1,Buyer Beware,"Purchased this about 1 1/2 years ago and loved it for 6 months. Then it started leaking. The leaking got progressively worse until we couldn't use the kettle at all. Called Braun for Customer Service, which was practically non-existent. They advised to send the kettle (still under warranty) to a service center in IL, so we did. They had the kettle for months. Finally another service center (in GA) called and somehow they had taken over and were able to ""repair"" the kettle. The kettle worked for about 2 weeks and then the electric connection in the base quit. After the months in the service center, the warranty had expired and so we're just out of luck, and money. I would NOT recommend this product, and we're still searching for a good stainless steel kettle and a company with some actual customer service."
1,looks good.......bad switch after less than one month.,too bad a better quality switch wasn't chosen by the product designers...looks good tho....I suppose that's the point.....a sad but familiar refrain in our march to create more and better landfills.
5,I love it,"I searched a lot online and in stores for the perfect electric kettle for me and I found this one which I am really satisfied with, it looks good in my kitchen, it heats water in a reasonable time, and it is easy to use and clean! Although it gets hot from the outside when u boil the water, but if u carry it with its handle then u got no problem, I just touched it accidentally once!!I just love it.."
2,Beautiful but too heavy!,"Works well and looks great but lifting is not fun. If you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle.This stainless WK600 one is listed at 6.4 lbs, and the white plastic WK200 is listed at 2.9 lbs. A big difference! The stainless one weighs empty close to what the plastic one weighs full. With a minimum fill of 1/2 liter The stainless weighs in at 7.4 lbs. and the plastic at 4.0 lbs.I'm returning my stainless WK600 unit and ordering the WK200 plastic one."
4,Braun Electric Kettle,I am very impressed so far with my Braun Kettle. It heats well and does as I expected as far as shutting off when heated. I have not had any problems with it so far and look forward to using it for a long time.
3,Base leaks on occassion,"We've owned three of these, and on two of them the base occassionally leaks a little. The strange thing is that it doesn't happen all the time."
1,Bad kettle,"I returned this product and got a full refund with no hassle. The problem was that the supposedly stainless steel base inside got rusty after 1 week of use! Maybe it was mineral deposits but it got awfully stained awfully fast, and the water tasted metallic. I also did not like the lid - it can't be taken off which made it difficult to fill, and also the exterior got really hot. I was disappointed as I loved the look of it, but I am looking for a better one..........."
1,"This kettle is a heavy, leaking and non-functioning piece of junk.","This beautiful electric kettle is extremely heavy. We bought the kettle to heat water once a day for morning coffee. Pretty soon the kettle stopped connecting to the heating element, so we had to press down on the top of kettle for the first minute or so, in order to make the kettle connect with the heating element and get the kettle to heat. Then the kettle started leaking. Seven months later, the kettle no longer works at all."
4,Good but not last long,"WK600 last me almost 5 years...It is twice more expensive now on amazon...so, will probably consider another brand and/or model."
5,Sensational!,It boils water really fast and it looks super chic in my kitchen! Not so heavy as I thought it would be. Well designed lid. It's easy to open with one push button. I have read so many reviews before I decided to purchase this item. I am so glad that I went with this!
3,Lasted over 4 years,"This kettle would have received 5 stars from me until a few months ago, when it started leaking. We have had it over 4 years, so that's not awful, but I would have liked to get 10 years out of it, for such an expensive kettle."
1,Leaks,"Loved the look but like a lot of other people who have owned this kettle for more than the 'honeymoon period', it starts to leak and eventually stops working. When I say eventually, I mean under 2 years. If you pay this amount of money for a kettle (!) wouldn't the expectation be that it should last for years and years?"
2,Leaks,I bought this kettle 3 years ago for considerably less than it is selling for now (under $70). It started leaking a couple years ago but if we didn't heat too much water we could manage it. Things gradually got worse. I am now shopping to replace it because the leaking has become intolerable. Aside from the leaks we've liked the kettle but I wouldn't buy it again even if it was still under $70.
5,Braun Electric Kettle,"This is a great electric kettle. We drink a lot of tea & this works perfectly for very fast, very hot water."
4,works great doesn't last,"It works wonderfully! I've had three and will keep buying them. I bought my first because of reviews here. Does anyone know how to keep them running longer than 8-10 months though? I use it everyday, sometimes 2 or three times a day. Speed is about the same as gas range but it's better than the stove because it turns itself off and better than the microwave because it keeps the H2O hot for quite a while. Aesthetically, it's OK compared to the white plastic ones. It has a larger volume than most ,too."
4,Braun WK600 Electric Kettle,This is my second in two years .. We use it in the faculty room at our school .. It gets lots of use from lots of people .. and has stood up very well .. which is exactly why we bought our second one ... If I can get two years out of this I will be delighted ... It looks great and works fast .. !
3,"Looks nice, but heavy & hot","We purchased the Braun WK600 kettle because of the recent fears in the news about plastic contamination in water carriers & kettles.The Braun W600 looks great, works great - however it is heavy (my wife struggles to lift when full) and the outside metal does get very hot. I burnt my fingers and would worry about small children touching."
5,Cool kettle. Best of the best!!!,Braun WK600 Impressions 7-Cup Electric Kettle is awesom product. I love it!
1,Very BAD,This Electric Kettle definitely is one of the poor choices I've made. You almost always cannot read the water gauge (it's full of steam so tracking the water line is almost impossible) and the outside steel is so hot when you warm the water that you could get a burn just breezing by it..... BOTTOM LINE DON'T BUY
1,I NEVER RECEIVED MY ORDER!!! BUT YOU CHARGED ME!,I have never rec'd this order and Amazon charged my charge card! I have tried to contact Amazon (good luck)- I have tracked the shipping which took forever - and still it was never received. I finally had to dispute the Amazon charge thru my credit card company. I usually have good experiences with Amazon BUT NOT THIS TIME.
5,"Wondrous, as usual for Jessye","I am not a fan of this type of music, and in truth have to be in the mood to even sit through it. That is, usually. I have other recordings of these works by other singer, and though they are fine, they never impressed me. When I found the recording with Jessye Norman ( and mostly because I love her voice immeasurably ), I decided to give them another chance. I was not disappointed! Norman's wondrous voice actually gives you the impression you are listening to great music. She gives it a warmth, and an aura that is unbelievable. This music is not great music and will never be in the class of Beethoven or even Verdi or Puccini, nor even Schubert, however, when sung by a truly great voice ( and not the mediocre ones that usually sing it )it does truly sore. If you wish to be introduced to Berg, this is by far the best recording to start with. You may even come to love his music and have the courage to try out some other things he composed."
2,"Eh, nothing special","I bought this book for a class but didn't think it was anything particularly special. It is more focused on private corporations behaving ethically and giving back to the community, etc. Certainly not worth the $40 it sells for; if you have to buy it, buy it used!"
5,Useful and Tasty!,"My mother swears by this tea and has been drinking it ever since she first discovered the Traditional Medicinal's brand. We both drink Female Toner on a regular basis, and it does seem to help alleviate period symptoms, especially cramps. My mother drinks it regularly, while I only drink it around the time I have my period, but it has been a useful tea to help boost women's health systems and to keep things balanced! It is also quite tasty, which is a bonus."
4,A Helpful Resource for the Middle School Teacher,"This book offers many tips and ideas to help make writing instruction revelvant for both the teacher and the learner. Being a middle school teacher, I know how difficult it can be to find books that really get to the heart of writing instruction. This is a book that I think really does. Check it out!"
3,Simply Lost Interest .....,"I have been looking for good vampire books with a contemporary twist less the romance routine ... I liked the premise, NYC based, detective style, cartels/neighborhoods ... it appeared interesting ... however after a while I felt I was reading about junkies instead ... the whole vampire world here is almost victim driven. They are limited in their power and terrified to make use of them ... I understand it to a degree but the end result is that after a while they just lose your interest ... I'm skipping the second in the series as it seems to be headed in the direction of ""Fat White Vampire Blues"" and giving ""Half of the Blood of Brooklyn"" a shot ... if it is more of the same I'll pass ... so far nothing to compete with Fingerman's great Vampire book ..."
1,"For the kindle price of free, I still fell like I've been ripped off!","Silly dialogue, weak story, lame detective novel disguised as a vampire story. Still better than twilight."
2,Dime store,"Reads like a dime store detective novel, but not as well written. Apparently he doesn't like quote marks, so he makes up his own punctuation. Starts out like a detective trying to catch some evil creatures, and rapidly turns into an explicit gay porn novel, while remaining dull and boring."
4,Good book series but price is absurd,"I am glad I got this book at an introductory price. It was quite entertaining. Unfortunately, I will not continue due to the cost of the novels. This book was written in 2005. The paperback costs 10.08 (though I bet I could go to a store and get it for less). How is it that the kindle version is only 9 cents cheaper at 9.99? Every book in this series is 9.99.I bought my kindle to be able to get books easier and perhaps REMOVE some of the cost of a paperback. This does not makes sense. Especially since even though this book is good, it is also pretty short. It is a steep price to pay for not new novels. I do NOT blame the author. Just his greedy publishers."
1,Trash talk - Couldn't get past the first chapter,"I downloaded this thinking it would be something different from what I usually read. I'd like to know why some authors can't write a story without using the ""F"" word in every other sentence? I find it most offensive and it certainly adds nothing to the story. Can't say if the plot was good. Couldn't get past the first couple pages. Deleted it."
4,"Vampires, Zomibes...need I say more?","I really enjoyed this one. It's a little campy, but I got it when it was offered for free. A vampire with the Vyrus hunts down zombies, works as a sort of private eye. Great read."
4,Not bad,"My first amazon review. I picked this kindle edition up for free so I wasn't expecting much. What I got wasn't too bad. I enjoyed the first person point of view and the dialogue. The vampire slant on hardboiled fiction was intersting. For those people who enjoy a hero, there aren't any to be found here. Everyone is pretty much a bad person to some degree. But, I will read the others in the series."
3,Good Not Great,"I'm not sure what I was expecting with this book. It's in the vampire genre, but has so many subplots and twists that nothing really seems to develop. I picked it up for free on kindle, so for free it was fine. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book, I doubt you'd feel like you got your money's worth."
4,Two thumbs up & I haven't finished the book yet!!!,I am only about half way through but I like it alot. Hard to believe that Amazon is giving it away for free. This a one fast read on my kindle.
3,"interesting take on vampires, stilted dialogue","The conception of vampires as gangs claiming turf in Manhattan with their nontraditional characteristics was an interesting take on an seemingly over popular genre but as a whole the story was merely adequate. Plot details seemed to coincide or wrap up too easily and the dialogue was forced. I wonder if the author has ever met a 15 year old girl because her character was flat. Overall a very quick read and enjoyable story if you are into a preternatural, Sam Spade detective story."
3,Noir Vamp,"Rather gritty noir tone to this one; Joe Pitt is a vampire PI (sort of, he's kinda like a get things done guy) and he has to balance between the different factions, while killing shamblers (zombies), finding a lost girl, and staying ali...undead. It's fast paced, lots of action, decent intrigue, and a entertaining escape."
5,"Gritty, different take on the vampire!","After reading Charlie Huston's take on the vampire,you will become hooked. No other writer can give that gritty, rough edged bite (pun intended) to the life of a vampire quite the same taste. Joe Pitt is flawed yet retains some semblance of right and wrong which keeps you entranced."
5,A Different Kind of Vamp Read,"I sorta stumbled onto this book, and I am so glad I did. It is not my usual type of Vamp reading style book. Way too dark, but I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. It introduced me to a totally different type of genre of Vamp reading. This is going on my Keeper shelf."
5,Great F*****g Book,"Fun, Interesting, Great Characters, Great Story. Gives a wonderful logical cogent functionality to this world that includes vampires. (Also an accurate and fun portrayal of current Manhattan). Excellent to the very end and beyond."
4,There are things worse than being dead...,"What can happen to you when you're already dead? I mean once you die and wake up to find that it's not the end of your existence, what's to worry about? Well, in Charlie Huston's Already Dead, Joe Pitt finds there are quite a few things worse than being dead and that there are still some things to be afraid of; very afraid. A delicious combination of hard-boiled detective novel and vampire political wrangling, Already Dead moves along at a fast, furious pace that demands to be read in one go. -- see my complete review in Jan 2006 SFRevu.com"
3,Weird yet fascinating,"This surrealistic portrayal of a netherworld in the City of New York is a creepy, wild, wacky look at Vampyres who have been infected with the Vyrus, and others with equally serious and disruptive ailments. Rather than spoil the story, I will say that the dialogue is crisp and witty, the descriptions are lucid while a little unbelievable, and the action is downright spooky. If you are a fan of the vampire genre, this is for you. But, as an introduction to the scene, it leaves out a few things, like credibility and truth, but hey, that's the genre for you!"
5,very good vampire tale,One of the few good vampire story. It is better than P.N Elrod. Awaiting the next one with anticipation.
4,Stays on the iphone for re-read,"I never really warmed up to Raymond Chandler books, but loved the Bogie movie versions -- Joe Pitt (the hero/PI/vampyre) is a great updated version of Sam Spade including the nice chick, the bad dame, the mix ups of friends and foes.I had a good chuckle at the chandler-esque word games and was thoroughly enthralled by the story. I feel like I want to read more about Joe and his world - I would even consider paying for this book!"
4,Vampires With A Twist,"Joe Pitt, the lead character in Already Dead, is a vampyre. He lives in a city where the vampyres have split into various gangs. They jockey for power while hiding their identity from regular humans. Pitt is like a vampyre detective. He's a rogue vampyre who refuses to affiliate with any one gang. And so he works for them all.The story was fast moving and well-written. There's mystery, suspense and humor to go along with the bloody paranormal stuff. Overall, a good read."
1,Book Ruined By Poor Formatting,"I picked this book up when it was offered as a freebie and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. The plot is not bad, but I was put off by the annoying way the author formatted the book. Instead of using italics, as is the norm, whenever a person speaks he prefaces statements with the em (-) mark. At times I had difficulty distinguishing between narration, thoughts and spoken words. As I read on this became such a distraction that gave up on the book."
2,Not too good,"I was very glad this was free! I'm not sure exactly what happened at the end, but I was glad it was over. Too much vampire!"
4,Great Read!,"This is the first book I've read on my Kindle - LOVE MY KINDLE.It kept me entertained and the story line was very good. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a fast paced not-your-ordinary-mystery with great characters, especially Joe Pitt. He's not your ordinary detective."
4,A Kindle Review,"Really great alt-vamp mystery semi-noir book. 4 stars instead of 5 beacuse the Kindle formatting was jacked. Also, I found the lack of quotation marks distracting rather than stunning. I assume the print books lacks quotes as well. That said, I will definately read the author's other books, and I would gladly read more of the seamy exploits of Joe Pitt, rogue vampire."
2,"Not Horrible, but certainly not great","I read a comment that this author made in a New York Times article on the Kindle. That in turn led me to discover this on the Amazon store (at the time, the Kindle edition of Already Dead was free as a teaser). While the author was grousing in the article about the publisher ""giving his work away for free,"" I can't help but come away from the reading experience thinking that the book was worth about what I'd paid for it.The plot was formulaic, and the characters difficult to empathize with. For what it's worth, I'd give this one a pass, despite the curious mixing of genres the author managed to achieve."
5,It's gritty and gore filled greatness,I can't rate this book high enough. Love everything about it.It is pure grit and very male. It is so well written I feel like I know the Author. If you like Charles Bukowski or Hunter S. Thompson this is your writer. It's gritty and gore filled greatness. He would do well with a follow up I imagine.
3,"It's not bad, they don't SPARKLE, but the testosterone can be a bit overwhelming","Overall, it was an enjoyable read. It lacked the depth that I sought. I don't know exactly what I was looking for, but this never went beyond a macho, superficial level for me. At times, too macho. The chicks in tight t-shirts and pig-tails serving up beer, the interactions between the main character, Joe and his associates - it all gets to be ""I'm such a big, cool, bad-ass"" a little too often. At least for me. When C. Huston tries to write from a woman's perspective, or what he thinks one of those might be, it can be cringe-inducing."
1,Could not get past the first 1/3 of the novel,"I needed a break from my mostly fantasy and sci-fi reading material and was looking for something in a more modern setting with a bit of a twist. After mostly stellar reviews on this book, I decided to give it a try. I have to say I was really really disappointed. The language is dry and simplistic, the plot was getting predictable, and the whole ""average Joe turned vampire/detective"" routine was just plain stupid. The character concept for Joe is just both hard to believe and not all that unique. Its like they took your average crime show detective that ""goes by his own rules"" that you see on every network and made him a vampire... The vampires are not even all that special, except that Huston explains that he's a vampire because of a virus... hurrayIf you really like detective novels and really like vampires, then maybe you will enjoy this. But without the vampire crime fighting gimmick this book is nothing. Just some mediocre dull writing."
5,A truly top notch book on respiratory diseases,I was sad to see that this book is no longer in print. Truly it is one of the better books in this area and should be required reading in respiratory therapist training programs. I found it was very helpful in preparing for my registry exam when I took it 5 years ago. The presentations are really clear and it makes for enjoyable reading while one is studying. I'm thrilled to have it on my bookshelf and hope that they will consider coming out with a new edition or reprinting the present one.
1,Pass this one by,Blue Star is probably the worst effort I've heard from one of the best Chicago Blues guys ever.
2,Useless anecdotes about a great artist,"This is probably the least important book ever written about Robert Crumb and his work. Although it's packed with people --- each one of them talks about Crumb in their own words --- almost everything they say is forgettable. I think it's because the chapters are so short. Each person gives you two or three pages about reading Zap in the 1960s or hanging out with Crumb. I got bored hearing the same tale over and over. Two chapters stand out: Crumb's ex-wife Dana and Roger Ebert. The Crumb artwork in the middle of the book looks nice, but most of it is excerpted from longer stories. Instead of this, just buy Fantagraphics' Complete Crumb Comics."
4,good night time intro to the city!,"If you're unsure of what to do in bangkok after dark this is a great intro to a few of the best picks in the city of angels. Something in it for almost everyone, from the clubbing scene and bar scene to night time shopping for the shopaholics among us. I appreacited the tongue in cheek commentary. bangkok is one of those huge sprawling cities like LA so a compact top ten stuff to do at night is a pretty goood way to ease you into what can be an intimidating destination."
5,Plethora Of Fun That's Fits In The Pocket,"A friend visiting me in Bangkok showed this to me and I checked it out to see how current it is, being a resident (former, current, and future) of the town we call Bangers. Long-termers refer to the city as ""Bangkok"" (with the accent on the 'kok' for people who've lived here a while who come from the UK or OZ, or a Yank who's a little cultured in expat arenas). It's kinda like never callin' San Francisco ""frisco"" or Los Angeles ""LA.""It's small and fits in yer pocket. As for the map, it provides easy-to-read points, and leads the curiosity seeker to venture into the most cultural appealing, funnest, and most vibrant places in the most accessible way. It's a guide to the real Bangkok, which is a cosmopolitan city that offers something for everyone from everywhere. After a coupla days you won't need it anymore, so give it to yer pal, fellow traveler, or bored friend in the West when he finally makes it over."
3,Good but not up to par,"I have to be one of the biggest jacksoul fans in the state of Washington, having bought their CDs as gifts for friends, and spreading the 'soul' gospel. I was so glad when this CD came out, but believe it does not measure up. The liner notes state they sang and recoded about 40 songs and struggled to chop it down. I am curious as to what miss the cut. There are some great covers here, and the new song ""oneSONG"" is great, but this CD falls short of ""Resurrected"", their best CD to date. I'm still a believer! Keep it up guys."
5,great television!,"I bought this television set for my daughter when she was 7, she is now 14. She passed it on to her little sisters and it still works great!"
4,A must have for Disney Princess lovers!,"My girls favorite present ever! They especially love the hidden princess perks -- when you turn the volume up, Ariel shows up; turn the channel, Cinderella is there. Also, when the DVD player goes to sleep mode, the TV turns to a scene from Cinderella. It's adorable and a great quality TV. Fits perfectly on the Disney Princess DVD/VCR combo!"
2,Nice TV but not for long.....,"We got Disney Princess 13"" TV plus DVD combo for Christmas , at first it was a great TV and my daughter loved it! However, two years later we are not so impressed! The DVD player stopped working about 6 months after we got it, and the color/picture of the TV is going out already! I have other TV's (not this make/model a different brand) and they have lasted 10+ YEARS! Yet this one barely makes it 2 years! I am NOT impressed with this TV and even more un-impressed with the DVD player that came with it. If I had to do it all over again I would NOT buy this again. Sometimes plain and simple is better I guess."
2,Worked okay at first,"We bought this television and dvd player combo about 2 years ago and I have had problems with the dvd for about a year now. At first it was great I had no problems, now I have a heck of a time getting dvd movies to play. Sometimes they do other times they start but stop. These are movies that play on my other television. No dvd player should stop working after one year of being purchased. Such a pain."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK,"If Danielle Steel didn't already have 60+ novels to her credit, this is yet another book that would have never been published. It is written in her outline-like style without any real feeling. While the story itself is good, it really got old that the reader had to wait so long for Faith and Brad to get together."
1,Totally predictable - just terrible,"I will not buy a D. Steele book again. I have enjoyed her books in the past although they invariably are ""formula"" as one reviewer put it. But this book is so bad.....repeating herself so many times in one chapter it almost defies belief. Is Danielle Steele becoming senile? I seriously considered taking this book back to the bookstore to exchange it"
5,Wonderful Book,"Wonderful yet so very sad at the same time. I am a HUGE Danielle Steele fan. This book, along with all her others are tops."
1,Pretty Boring,"If I could have given 1/2 star I would have. You tend to get tired of hearing the same chatter over and over again in the e-mails. Jack, Praying (and for someone who only went to church on Christmas Eve) that was annoying and being called Fred. Faith had no back bone and was pretty stupid to put up with Alex. All the characters were whiners, execpt for Zoe who seemed to have the most personality. Not the best Danielle Steel. I finished last night and was quite happy to have it end. Thank ""God"" I got it from the Library."
5,A truly thoughtful journey of self-discovery,"Answered Prayers by acclaimed romance author Danielle Steel is the compelling story of Faith Madison and Brad Patterson, two childhood friends who are each caught up in the midst of unhappy marriages and who correspond by e-mail. Gradually Faith and Brad find the courage to take necessary (albeit painful) steps in their lives that they never dared to take before. Answered Prayers is highly recommended as a truly thoughtful journey of self-discovery and reaching out to embrace life. The large print format is ideal for readers who vision requirements necessitates an easy-to-read font size."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I agree with Kristi of the U.S. It was a good story line but not believeable, pretty bland, but mostly I got aggravated with the repitition. I guess you fill pages that way and make a lot of money but it's not fair to the readers. I was glad when it was over and sorry I paid full price for this hard-back book."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Boring, repetitive, predictable. Definitely not one of her best novels. Faith's brother Jack was brought up over and over again, so often in fact that while I was listening(book on tape) I thought several times that I had accidentally rewound it or put the same tape back in instead of a new one.Nothing unusual here. Old friendship rekindled,both are in unhappy marriages but they are only friends, both marriages break down and WHAM they find out they are actually in love. How boring."
1,ick,"DS goes up and down, this one is down. Faith is such a wuss I lost all interest in her 1/2way throught the book. It is a throwback plot to the fifties--what middle aged man today would have such a strong reaction to an innocent little desire to go back to law school? Get real. Boring, dreary, and the emails do get horribly boring. And for such a pious little wimp that Faith is made out to be, she sure doth cusseth a lot."
3,"same ole, same ole","Danielle Steele has essentially been writing the same book over and over again since ""The Promise"" came out. Obviously, her true fans love her formula and trust it.And after 56 books she knows the right way to go to get a bestseller. However, if you are a casual romance fan or if you haven't touched a Steele book since high school, I'd say pass this by or go the library. The only thing that stands out about it is that the tragedy is a little more dreary than usual."
4,You'll hate her husband!,"After being disappointed with a few of the newer Steel books, I thought this one was quite good. Beware though- you'll hate the husband! It's actually amazing to think there could ever be a man out there like this. I couldn't wait for him to get what was coming to him!I know a lot of people might read this story and think the characters are too simple-minded or that the story is predictable. Well, maybe they are; but the story kept me reading and I started to really love certain characters and love to hate others. Every now and then, you just need a good love story, no matter how predicatable or sappy."
1,Hated it!!!,"This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read. I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book. I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through. This one has gotten on my last nerve. I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable. But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books. It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them."
5,A very good bedtime read.,"Good story, easy reading.DS. is one of my favorite writers, but sometimes she repeats herself in describing characters. Not in this book!"
5,I love reading,I love Danelle steel books. Thank you and now that I have the kindle I can read more I have almost every one of her books.
4,Good Read,I like Danielle Steel's books. She tells a good story. I don't like her PERFECT heroines so much. I always get the feeling she is trying to sell herself as the heroines and how perfect she is. NO ONE is perfect. I even quit buying her books for a long time because of that feeling.
4,Typical of Danielle Steel,"Liked the book very much. There was mystery included in the romance, and a great development of characters. The old friend was a great character."
1,YAWN,"I also would have given this a 1/2 star if I could. Probably the worst DS book I have read. Very boring and unbelievably predictable. Someone else said it, I think DS phoned this one in."
2,"I agree, very bland.","I totally agree with Kristi (a huge disappointment) on this book. This droaned on and on repeating the same thing over and over again. This book could have covered the same story in 100 pages or less if things like her horrible childhood and how she deserved to be treated badly by everyone weren't repeated in every chapter.I have only read a few Steel books but this one is almost exactly like the last one I read (The Dating Game)with a middle aged man divorcing the perfect, beautiful wife after 20 plus wonderful years to run off with some young tart.Faith made me ill. Did women ever, even in the 1930's, let their husband treat them like that!Save your money!"
1,Boring and predictable,"This book has way too much repeating of information in it. On each page the author seems to keep telling us the same thing over and over again like the reader is going to forget something from page to page.It also has a very predictable plot. I couldn't even finish the story because I was so bored.I have loved most Danielle Steel books in the past, but her most recent books have really disappointed me."
2,"BOOK WAS OK, NOT GREAT",I ALSO AGREE THAT THIS WAS A VERY BLAND BOOK. THE REPETITION GOT RIDICULOUS. I WOULD EXPECT MORE FROM DANIELLE STEEL
4,Tis the season to be reading.,"I got three books to tuck in with this holiday season--- Good In Bed by Jennifer Weiner--- Cloned Love by Thorne Peters and this book by Danielle Steele. I read this one first. Danielle Steel knows how to get her story off the ground right away, her characters are fully developed when you meet them and she always understands the point that she's trying to make so you're seeing what she sees. ALL of her books are great and this one is Fantastic!!! That's why her name on the cover sells instantly; we know what we're getting."
5,Worth the price,"I love all the hipsters from Spoylt! I just added these ones to my collection and they are so cute, I will definitly be getting the matching bra. Just a tip about their sizing, I would recommend getting a size smaller than you usually wear. Also, all their stuff comes in beautiful pink boxes"
1,Poor,"First, the inside case was damaged because the plastic wrap securing the cans in the case had been torn apart. Due to that, every can was dented so badly, I was unable to place the can on any flat surface without it falling over, or the top of the can was dented outwards that the pull tab broke off while attemping to open it. I wound up using a hammer to flatten out the dent on the bottom and/or using pliers to remove the entire pull tab. They also could not be stored standing up in the refrig.After drinking the first can I immediately did not care very much for its taste. It had a flavor that is difficult to describe...not fruity, but more like a funny bubble gum taste, and it did not provide any energy, at least not to me.I purchased this product a few months ago and I still have about fifteen (15) ""dented"" cans remaining.I highly recommend that anyone makes an attempt to purchase and try one (1) can before purchasing an entire case of twenty-four (24)."
4,Lots of fun,"My 3 year old daughter really enjoys this toy. She likes the baby animals and ability to put them in the balloon or slide them down the slide. Super cute. You do have to be careful to keep up with all the pieces as the apples are tiny and easily lost, but overall its a great toy."
1,Don't bother with this one...,"I loved the other books in the series. This one, however is not good at all. The hero is a lout. Kissing what he thought was a servant girl while she is asking for help for her friends who are stuck in an overturned carriage, during a violent storm? Please, spare me! I couldn't find one redeeming quality in this guy. I wouldn't bother with this one."
3,Good Read,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't turned away by the fact that the hero preferred...well, the heroine...over his betrothed. It was pretty much made clear from the start that he had no interest whatsoever in being wed and that the marriage would be one in name only. I enjoyed the interaction between the hero and the heroine; it was both witty and engaging. Although the story started off well enough at the beginning, it kind of fell apart towards the end for me. However, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good read. My first read by Anne Gracie but definitely not my last."
4,Pekingese dogs like it,"I got this food because the rescue I got my little dogs from finds this the most well-tolerated for their dogs. It also has high quality ingredients. My dogs will eat this with no problem, although they sometimes leave it. I just tried a small dog food with smaller pieces that they like a bit better so I think I'll switch. I will probably return though once in a while because this is more economical yet also high quality."
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED OR ANY COMMUNICATION ABOUT IT,"ITEM WAS NEVER RECEIVED.PLUS NO COMMUNICATION REGARDING WHEN IT WOULD BE COMINGOR IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM.NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS NOT HAPPY, SINCE I'VE PAID FOR IT.LWOOD"
5,I love Mylene Farmer!,"This is a great album by a great female singer.On the one hand this album has very soothing ballads and on the other hand some upbeat rock oriented songs.My Favorite songs are: California - a very good ballad and one of her biggest hits, also L'instant X ,XXL , Alice , Tomber 7 Fois.don't get me wrong I have absolutely no idea what she's singing about, I don't speak french but I still enjoy the music and her voice. Also try her greatest hits album ""Les Mots"" and her live version of this album, her live performances are also great."
4,Her best studio album,"So you want to start a Mylene CD collection...firstly buy ""Les Mots"", her recently released greatest hits. Then get ""Live a Bercy"", her best live album (better than Mylenium tour). ""Anamorphosee"" is her best studio album IMHO, and the change of style to other worldly rock chick suited her very well. Even though this has guitars on it, expect the usual high melodic standard, provocative lyrics and unique style. The first part of the album is stronger than the second half, as I find ""Laisse Le Vent..."" and ""Tomber 7 Fois"" slightly weaker tracks, and never understood the hysteria regarding ""Rever"" either. Still I am sure other fans will think differently, but what we will agree on is that this is a very strong album which set an extremely high standard which its follow-up ""Innamoramento"" failed to reach."
5,The Best Recording Ever!,"I was so impressed with this recording and as a violinist I believe that you should own a copy of this high class masterpiece. Stern's sound is so rich and deep that it touches your heart in a way that is life changing. If you want to hear a great master of the violin, buy this recording and you will not regret it."
4,Still a great one.,"Isaac Stern really pours it on. He plays with certainty and strength and makes even the more sedate parts shine and I think his impassioned interpretations during the Bruch and Wienawski are exciting. Never muddy, he adds depth and solidarity to the long notes and delicacy to the high ones. I enjoy the entire album but I especially enjoy the Bruch."
5,This man can go anywhere and wipe the floor everytime,"No need for over analysis. Peter murphy has , over his carrer done what a rare few can do. Which is to make music that defies categorisation.He can move from pure avante guard to pure pop and all in between and remain convincing, no! nigh on amazing. Born with a genius that is untrained yet inborn. Seemingly writing music , performing,and (THAT) singing is a state of being, without effort. This man is THE cutting edge.Unshattered just happends to be a brilliant main stream album, the next , who knows . Judging by his complete body of work you just can't tell where he'll go next. All this , and the eyes of Joseph - the voice of David."
1,What in the world....?,"First off, let me just say I've been a huge fan of this man since the first Bauhaus record. I've seen him 4 times and have loved most all of his work-until now. This album lacks melody, rhythm and sincerity. Has Murphy become Sting? Honestly, I have listened to this over and over and I just don't get it. What happened? After Dust, I thought he had gone back to being the innovator again. What a disappointment. Please come back Pete!"
2,The poster child for not smoking,"I've been a Murphy fan since his Bauhaus days. The 'adult contemporary' stylings of the new album aren't a surprise; he's been edging that way for some time now.My big gripe is the fact that his voice ... well, it has gotten worse over time. There are points on this album where I was cringing at his singing, a thought unthinkable back in his glory days when he could rival Bowie for most incredible vocals. I'm not a psycho anti-smoking zealot, but it's clear that his taste for fags has ruined his voice. On the plus side, at least he didn't feel the need to Pro-Tools his voice to death as some artists have chosen to do.If it was anybody else, I'd probably give it one star, but I still harbor fond feelings for Murphy."
1,This is the worst EVER!!!,"I have enjoyed Peter since the beginning, what a joke! Peter I want my money back! I didnt learn my leason after the cd, I went to his concert,go back to Turkey.What a sell out!"
4,Best Kept Secret,"This is a good CD and it has its moments of brilliance. But the main reason I am writing is to say that the man's voice remains strong and incredible (a previous reviewer said it was not). I just saw him in Atlanta 5/13/05 and he was mesmerizing, witty, and wonderfully strange. The songs that he played from the new album took on a new life when played live. He stepped up there and sang like no one I had ever heard before. Why his genius isn't more widely recognized is beyond me. Hopefully he will continue on with that haunting brilliant voice and persona."
5,If Our Love Song...Could Fly Over Mountains,"Something for everybody? Everybody for something. This is a Peter Murphy album. A few dated drum-machine moments and the odd bizarre, twinkly 80s synth sound might distract at first, but not for long. Emergency Unit broods like a Disappearing electric guitar, only acoustic. The First Stone is unlike anything else by anybody, even if it was instrumental, and then he sings like a bird. Blinded Like Saul is a noisechunk celebration of something. Batman? Breaking No One's Heaven could be the best vocal he's ever sung. And that's saying something. It's a beautiful voice, & it sings from some heaven. Mohammed Reza Shajarian & David Bowie are amongst his brethren. And that's saying something else..."
4,Solid and Mesmerizing!,"This album definietly goes back to the relm of Love Hysteria, Deep and Cascade. Though maybe not as polished as Deep and Cascade, Unshattered is true Peter Murphy. His amazing voice is still right up there with the best in rock. These songs will blend in well with Peter's oldies when he tours again just as the songs from Dust did on the last tour. I can't wait to see this mesmerizing performer again and to see is imagery and his voice. Oh man his voice...."
2,if you were going to leave just one PM album out of your collection...,"this one would be it. i give it 2 stars because i believe that there are some flashes of lyrical and sonic brilliance here, but they fade pretty quickly. i'm wondering where the wheels came off of this album during production -- the quality of the recording is great, peter's voice is amazing, but i'm confused by the patchy and irregular instumental arrangements and the lack of enthusiasm and continuity. please, may the recording contract luck be better with peter next time... and perhaps on the next one we'll have some turkish musicians? ... maybe even playing unplugged? i hope so."
4,"An acquired taste, but a good CD.","This album is more like a fusion of his earlier stuff with Cascade. This album goes in a completely different direction than Dust. At first, I wasn't too pleased with the CD. I listened to samples on the website and thought ""My god...what is this adult contemporary crap!?"" ... but I picked up the CD anyway and after 2 listens I would put this CD with some of the ones I like best."
2,Speculation Only Please,"The praise that reviewers lavish on speculative works of this kind betray an absolute ignorance of the actual findings of archaeology, geology, paleogenetics, and other fields of bonafide research. Reads like this book are fun though...and remind me of what I loved about Marvel comics as a kid. Nuff Said."
3,Common...,"I'd give it an 8 for scope and chustpa and a 2 on delivering the goods. Although I don't believe the Great Pyramid was ever a tomb the author never convinced me that it was a ""death ray"" machine. He constantly quotes other authors who use the same unsubstantiated ""facts"" to support their theories. And then he quotes himself by using a diminutive type face in the middle of the page as another source. Again and again he made claims that seemed as silly as, ...if I made ham and eggs for breakfast, the great pyramid is a death weapon. Yes I learned a little more than I already knew about the Great Pyramid from reading Hancock's books on the Giza complex, but the assertions needed more substance behind them. I'm hoping the government in Egypt will allow more scientific exploration of the Pyramid so humanity will at last find out what it was really built for, but until then its all speculation."
5,GREAT BOOK,I LOVED THIS BOOK SO MUCH I WONT THE WHOLE FAMILY OF BOOKS THAT ARE IN THE SERIES .I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK VERY HIGHLY.
2,"high style, major design glitch","I chose this kettle based on the cool design and the hope that the all-in-one lid and spout would be elegant and simple. When I pushed the red button to open the lid/spout, droplets of hot water splashed on me, which was annoying. Then, after two days of use, the lid got stuck in the opening,and would not open, no matter how hard I pushed on the button. If you can't get the lid open, you can't fill or pour from the kettle.The stainless steel material was great, but this design is a failure. I would highly recommend looking for another funky stainless teakettle design."
5,great,This is just what I wanted for a gift. Could not find it locally. I am glad that I was able to find it.
5,GREAT CONDITION AND FAST SHIPPING,very pleased with the shipping speed. This was a great condition book for only around $4.00...Thanks!
5,Exceptional Series! Fun for everyone in the Family!,"Set in Australia during the later part of the 18th century ""Five Mile Creek"" has something for everyone! Boys and Girls/Moms & Dads will enjoy the history of the wild west with new friends becoming like family. They meet villains and see tragedies with good strong people supporting one another through it all!Our family has seen videos 1 through 15. I am not aware of any other video series of its kind! It has even inspired my older two sons (ages 13 & 12) to begin read for pleasure! My only disappointment is that the rest of the series is no longer available from Disney and we haven't seen the wedding yet! We'd love to see videos 16 and higher!"
5,Great for all audiences!,"Very family oriented. Clean, no profanity, solid family values, with a constant propensity toward the right and correctness. A great series !!"
5,Australian Western - Incredibly Produced Family Series,"Five Mile Creek is a lovable, endearing ideo series about one woman's life experiences that takes her from her home in the USA to the Australian outback. The story is set in the western trail blazing days of Old Autralia and is placed within indescribable picturesque panorama's of endless, wild, landscapes. Follow this wonderfully written and performed story edited into 2 hour video segments. Take your self and your family on a journey that you will not soon forget along the Five Mile Creek."
2,Indy Wouldn't Last a Day With This,My mom and I bike rode to Party Time to see if they had their Halloween stuff up. They didn't have costumes up yet but they had there usual Halloween arsenal of costume weapons with the unusual suprise of a six foot whip. I immediatly wanted to get it because it would go well with the gangster hat I bought that looked like Indiana Jones' fedora. The minute it came out of wrapper I noticed it was covered in tar like stuff and the red part was split because there was no knot to hold it together. After a few minutes of trying in vain to crack or pull things with it the red part broke off and the end became unbraided so I got mom to take me back to Party Time to replace it. When I got home I wrapped the end of the new one it in tape. The only reason I got because it was at Party Time.
4,It's just a battery,"New battery. Received it, charged it, installed it, camera worked fine. Second recharge was good too. A lower price would have been nice."
3,"Common Marsh, Underwater & Floating-leaved Plants of US & Ca","Hotchkiss has provided a practical, easy-to-use guide to identifying underwater and marsh plants to species level. This information is useful to wetland scientists, aquatic biologists, and others who need to accurately identify and characterize submerged plant communities. Line drawings are easy to read and distinctions between common species are clear. Drawbacks: incomplete when it comes to rarer species."
4,Sleek and well made.,"I was pleasantly surprised by the lamp base parts having all metal construction, meaning the 3-way switch is metal instead of being plastic. The shade is lined and appears well-made. The ""beads"" on the lampshade are actually ordinary ball chains wrapped vertically around the shade, but it does add an extra, more industrial, element in the design. The only part of the lamp that I feel could have been improved upon is the bottom of the base. The bottom does not make contact with my table all the way around because it's design has 4 built-in metal feet. I feel the lamp would be more stable if they made the bottom uniformly flat leaving only a small cut-out for the ac cord. That is why I am not giving the lamp 5 stars."
3,broken case on one of the 3 movies,All of the discs come in good condition but the third movies' case was broke and cracked all over beyond repair so that was kind of disappointing other than that everything else was good
5,Great Price for the set,This was a great price for an action packed series. This was definitely a good buy. The action is awesome of course. Can't wait until T4 comes out.
5,Great movie!!,"If you like action movies, this is the movie to watch. It has excellent effects, and great story. This is a must have for action lovers."
4,Dope set.........But contained bad disk,Everthing was in working order. Except the DOTM disc started to skip in the middle of the movie. Kinda strange. Called amazon and the service was absolutely exceptional. Right away they put the order in the replacement. Same shipping and everything. Just be you check the disc before you play it. Movie sounds completely amazing in 7.1 surrounding sound.
3,Well....,I am semi disappointed in this collection. In short it is all three movies in very basic Blue Ray cases inside a cardboard case. the movies look like they were part of a set of 2 discs due to the first movies disc saying disc 1. they have very minimal special features. nothing for a movie fanatic. If you want just the movies here ya go. If you want a ultimate collection look elsewhere
3,Question about subtitles,"I purchased this item 'cause i love Transformers movies, but i returned because i didn't knew if this trilogy comes with english, spanish, french, portuguese or any languages subtitles, does it?"
2,I Just Don't Undetstand,amazon should hold off until the release of the items before you can't make a review. you have idiots on here giving the opinion on the movie but not the item itself. I'm doing my review on the french version of this item. The item is cheaply made. not worth the extra money for a stupid cardboard cutout.
2,Don't Buy it,"Don't buy it, because the second one is the worst, the third is okay, and the first is the best, but don't buy this, because you're wasting your money on a horrible sequel. The only good things in this in this box set are just the first and the third, but buying the second is wasting your money, so yeah don't buy it."
1,These movies are a load of propaganda for 12 year olds,"Aliens attack earth, only the ""gods chosen one"" can save the world.Been there done that, the jewcentric hollywood model is flagrantly racist. Especially when spielberg fires an actress for comparing the director to hitler.It's as though hollywood and the holocaust industry have copyrighted hitler and maintain exclusive rights.Although to be fair, hollywood made several ""black man savior"" movies with will smith to prep people for Obamas reign. Prior to those movies Smith was relegated to doing the heavy lifting for goldblum in ID4."
1,YIKES!,For $135? What else needs to be said - for that kind of money I don't purchase three movies - what a scan.
1,Ugh,"The first movie was merely bad: awful script, terrible acting, and mind-numbing plot. It's a Michael Bay movie so it's literally nothing but pretty explosions. There's no real exposition, no characters, and the end result is actually more one-dimensional than the original cartoon!The sequels were worse - a cash-grab where the producers went through the motions again."
2,No ROTF IMAX edition in this set,"As outlined on the official Michael Bay forums, the IMAX edition of ROTF will not be included with this set; link: http://www.shootfortheedit.com/forum/showthread.php?10128-TF1-2-3-trilogy-Steel-Set-Update-3&p;=197380&viewfull;=1#post197380Thus, a no-buy for me....guess I'll just get the films individually (and I waited on buying any of the films so I could get a trilogy set).PS: Please understand that I gave this boxset a 'star rating' only because I had too. Since I don't intend on buying this now, I wouldn't have rated it if I didn't have to."
1,Not happy,Movies were boot leg. The movie box they came in was the best thing about it. It could have atleast described it was going to be that way before I paid my money.
1,There WILL BE a TRANSFORMERS 4 in 2014,"I know this is not a review for this product but I would like to inform future buyers that would like to buy or consider buying this collector's trilogy when there will be a part 4 in 2014.****SEE LINK IN COMMENT SECTION****I was really seriously considering on getting this collector's item as I am a huge TF fan but holding off and reading back in December that Bay is in talks with the producers, Hasbro and Paramount for a possible fourth installment is now coming in to fruitation.Having this said, please consider this news before buying. Again, I am not discouraging people to buy this product. It's your money, your decision. I would just like to inform you of this news and how this may affect the value of this item or if they are going to have a collector's four-pack. Only time will tell I guess. As for the one-star rating, it is because IMO, this item may not have a good collector's value knowing there is a going to be a part four."
1,DVD VERSION?!?!?!?!,"I wish they would make a DVD version of this 7-disc set!!!! I want the trilogy, but just not on blu-ray!!!!"
4,Great,"Great idea of including all movies in a neat case, just wish the case was a bit more sturdy and not made of cardboard :/"
5,Great Movies,We have watched these movies already so many times. We love it. Never regret buying this item. Would buy it again.
2,The cellophane tape ruined this collection!,"This is a marvelous collector's item for any Transformers fan. However why the heck there are cellophane tapes across all the front discs. One of the blu ray's front layer was peeled off during removal of the tape across the blu rays. DAMN! My collection is of no value anymore as the disc was damaged. I would strongly advise Amazon to contact the discs manufacturers to stop attaching cellophane tape on the blu ray discs, they ain't gonna fall off as its in the BOX!? I got my refund from Amazon, but I am frustrated and sad that this had to happen to my favorite limited edition box set. Its priceless but the damaged is irreversible!!! This is the only risk for potential-buyers need to take if you are reading this review!"
5,Great series,"No need to explain, if you are buying this, you have at least seen one of them or all and want it so you can view whenever you want."
5,great!,first time i have seen the transformers sold as a trilogy and my bf is going to love that i found this since he has always wanted the transformer trilogy!
5,It's Transformers!,Regardless of reviews I love these movies. Brings back some childhood nostalgia of the Transformers cartoons. Entertaining movies. Great price.
3,"Movies are great, release not as great","Let me start off by saying the trilogy is an awesome one, and happy to add to my blu-ray collection! Each film kicked butt on the big screen! I give each film a 5/5 also! My 3 star rating is for the set. I bought it knowing it had no special features...but here is my gripe. This set was $40! I wasn't about to pay more for special features even though I wanted them. Good movies, but in my mind, for $40, they should have included each two-disc edition. There may be one out now, I don't know, but at the time, this was my maximum spending limit. Just know it is just the movies when you get this!"
3,Oops no extra content,Price was so good I hopped on board...theses are the movies but no extra content at all. Just like the disk you get when you rent.
3,Do you like special features,These movies are good the only i had with this box set was the special features were absent. If you dont care about having the special features buy this its very affordable for a three pack of bluray movies
3,Review,"Though the movie has a excelent video quality, the Blu-Ray boxes otherwise appears to be a cheaper version of boxes in general."
4,For Transformer Fans.,"While I don't think this set is the end all be all sets, the price isn't that bad for what it is. I'd say that this is strictly for fans of the films and of Transformers who don't have the all the movies or don't mind a cool little collectible. The price isn't all that unreasonable depending what its final sales price is, and lets face it, they aren't making a whole lot of these, so this time next year, I can see these being a bit on the pricey side."
2,Teenage Boy Fantasyland,"I give the writers credit for coming up with something fresh, and I even managed to stay awake through most of the first movie, but that's where my compliments end. I thought the parents were cartoonish, the transformers better actors than the humans, and I HATED how unrealistic the two female leads looked/acted over the course of the three movies. Nothing against the actresses given those parts, but I would've preferred younger, more age-appropriate actresses for these movies, the type of females teenage boys actually see at their schools -- instead of just in their fantasies."
2,Be Aware,This is not the 3 films in 3d. Like many of the Blu rays sold by Amazon this is not all the films in 3d Blu Ray
3,No Digital Copies?,All this...but does it have digital copies of the movies? If so this would be a perfect set...until number 4 comes out.
2,"Very dated, but very well done!","This book is very dated! The latest edition came out in 1984. In addition, I am not sure it applies at all to recent versions of the BASIC language.However, the book is very well organized and well written. BASIC functions are listed alphabetically, with a short description as well as examples. The appendices include several tables that are still relevent to date, especially for ""derived functions"".No one would probably want to buy this book now, it's out of print anyway. However, I wish more recent books can be this well done."
5,tina finds her path,"The thing that makes a song great for me is that when you least expect it, the tune pops into your head. Tina's new CD has done that for me once again, as have her past two releases. She is just that kind of honest and talented songwriter that can match an idea with a melody and catch you hummming it the next day. Faves on her new record for me are the title cut,"" The Road Home"", "" The Box"", and "" Raise Your Voice"". Oh, and if you ever get a chance to see her live...do it! Be prepared however to feel the full spectrum of human emotions. Translation..bring kleenex:-)"
2,Pinches little palms,"Be super careful when pressing this top down. My 6 month old was playing with it and I was helping her push it down and her little palm got caught in the gaps on top and pinched pretty hard. Its not our favorite toy but with supervision, I don't have a problem with her playing it."
3,Small but fun,"This is a compact version of the classic toy. My 7 month son can only see the balls if he is laying on his tummy. However, it is so small and light that he can pick the toy up by the handle, flip it over, etc. It's about the size of a lantern."
3,jury is still out,i got this for my 8 month old grandson. He is amused by it when an adult presses down the top for few seconds. All he can do at this point is knock it over and look for something else to play. Perhaps he will find it morew interesting as he gets older... we'll see
3,Concordancia Basica de la Biblia,"Es una buena herramienta para el estudio de la Biblia por su contenido, creo que como referencia rapida y completa es de mucha utilidad."
4,This model has been DISCONTINUED,"You might want to do a search for comparisons of newer models. Make sure you can afford the filters, they can get expensive."
5,FEW WORDS ABOUT K. KOMEDA,I'M FROM POLAND AND I WANT TO SAY THAT KRZYSZTOF KOMEDA IS THE BEST EUROPEAN JAZZ COMPOSER. EVERYBODY MUST SEE ROMAN POLANSKI'S ROSEMARRY'S BABY. IN THIS MOTION PICTURE YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE BEST SAMPLE OF KOMEDA'S MUSIC
2,"Big Box, Great CD Sound, Lousy Picture","My Zenith DVD5201 is going back to the store. The sound from my music CDs is great. I wanted a 5-disc changer and the random feature is satisfactory. After four to five minutes, though, the video and audio of DVDs becomes garbled. After twenty minutes the video and audio break up completely. Perhaps I just got a dud. However, since the player is so large that it won't fit anywhere in my little home, it is going back to the store and an even exchange won't be accepted."
