1,Bissell 1425b Little Green Proheat Turbo Carpet Cleaner,"This was just a very poor quality machine, it heated and it sprayed but when the fluid is on your furniture there was little or no power to suck it up, so if you sprayed out 1/2 cup of shampoo you got back a few tablespoons, I seldom send back anything, but this item was a total waste of money..I went and rented the rug doctor ahd it worked just fine with the bag of attachments for furniture. It would be great if Bissell would make a small furniture shampoo which actually has good suction. Fancy name for a machine that didn't work, Amazon was great in handling the return!!"
1,BISSELL LITTLE GREEN PROHEAT CARPET CLEANER,I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO AND I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. I HAD TO BRING IT TO GET REPAIRED AND WAS TOLD I DIDNT FLUSH IT OUT. I BROUGHT IT HOME AND NEVER USED IT FOR AWILE. I TRIED TO USE IT THE OTHER DAY AND IT IS STILL BROKEN. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
2,Don't Bother If It's Cat Urine,"I have 3 cats and one small dog. I purchased this unit to clean pet ""accidents."" It did a pretty good job on the dog accidents, however, I did just as well with a spray cleaner and rag. As far as cat accidents, forget it. This unit only spread the urine stain around. It did not remove the odor, either. If you have a carpet stained with cat urine - it's pretty much hopeless. I plan on ripping the carpet out and replacing it with flooring."
1,Worked great the first 2-3 times...not after that,"When I first bought this spot cleaner I thought it was the greatest. However, after emptying it and storing it away for awhile, the next time I went to use it it was clogged and I couldn't get it to do anything - the sprayer didn't work and it didn't suck up anything. Considering I was cleaning up after a sick pet, it was late and I had work to do, I had no time to deal with fixing it. It immediately went in the garbage. The way it is configured makes it difficult to clean and maintain. If you want to spend more time fixing than using then this is for you. If you are like the remaining 99% of the population, keep looking."
1,Works for a while,"I bought this machine to clean up after my two dogs and was very happy with it for about 2 days. All the spots reappeard and the machine (even though I thorougly cleaned out the dirty water tank) had a horrible smell. The brush got clogged up with hair and I could not get it out. I strongly suggest NOT buying this product, I ended up throwing mine away."
1,"Typical Bissell, breaks quickly","First I bought the unit without the heater and powered brushes. It worked for a short while and quickly lost all suction despite the fact that I maintained it according to the instruction manual. Since it was just past the 1 year warranty I went out and upgraded rather than have the unit serviced, buying the unit with the heater and the powered brushes. I've used it but three times and it no longer sprays and it no longer pulls sufficient vacuum to move the brushes. In fact, it no longer pulls sufficient to draw the cleaning solution even if I spray it onto the surface manually. Unfortunately, between the last use when it worked and my current attempt to use it a time period which puts it out of warranty again has elapsed. I will never again buy a Bissell product."
2,Too much mess,"I bought this product today to clean up a spot on my upholstered chair where one of my cats vomited. Not only did it NOT get the spot out, but it SOAKED the cushion. I also tried cleaning some smaller old spots on my light green carpet (they are still there). I wish I knew what I was doing wrong as other reviewers seem to think this machine works so well. In my experience, there is hardly any suction at all. I used half the water/cleaner tank and the dirt/flush tank had barely any water in it. After reading the reviews about durability and heater problems and witnessing the watery mess I ended up with, I am returning this product in the morning."
1,fix or repair daily,I've had this product for less than one year and I'm extremely disappointed in it. It has been in the repair shop three times already and I've only tried to use it seven times. The heater does not heat. The unit leaks all over the place and the water did not spray out in a continuous spray and often got clogged. I asked for it to be replaced the last time I bought it to the repair shop as it was still under warranty and all they told me it was fixed and not to use tap water. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I purchased a Dirt Devil Jaguar Featherlite unit for about the same price and I'm very happy with it.
1,Little green **** machine,"It worked great the first time I used it. The next time I went to use it, the nozzle that sprays the cleaning fluid was clogged. I took it to a Bissell authorized repair shop to get it repaired. $35 later, it worked again... I didn't touch it for a few months until I needed it again, and, the nozzle that sprays the cleaning fluid is clogged, again. $135 total, and I've used it once. A phone call to Bissell customer service yeilded nothing. I purchased a spot cleaner since we have hardwood floors and area rugs... this product does not function well as I thought it was intended. I would strongly recommend purchasing a different product."
4,Bissell Little Green Pro Heat,I have had this product for several years now and am happy to have it. We have used it many times now. I would NOT suggest getting the extra turbo brush as we used it only once or twice in the beginning and not again until recently when the other brush cracked and the cleaner doesn't come out where it is supposed to. But overall I would purchase the machine again.
1,For $100 I expected a lot more,"I got this hoping that it would help out with carpet stains from our two animals. It did an alright job -- not great -- getting the stains out. However, the work to fill it, mess around with it, clean and empty it when you are done, then find a place to put the huge thing was more than it was worth. Then, it started to leak everywhere. This was just the second time I used it. I returned it and replaced the whole thing with a small bin of carpet cleaner, a scrub brush and paper towels. That works just as well, if not better, never leaks, will never clog and the best part -- only cost me $15."
1,Nice when it lasted-all of only 3 times!,"I used this cleaner a total of 3 times, shortly after I purchased it and each time, I was happy with the results.However! I put it away and 1 year later, come time to clean my couch/loveseat in time for the holidays...guess what, you guessed it-Kaput! It is our guess that the pump went out.We did blow through the line, to make certain there wasn't a blockage but air did flow. Hence our thinking it the pump.To make matters worse (Bissell!) shortly after discovering that my Little Green was broken, did my beloved Bissell vacuum break and in less than a year!I have since concluded that while Bissell makes some nice products, that they are not built to last. To note, no...I am not hard on my equipment.On account of both my negative experiences with a Bissell product, I will not purchase another product from them ever again.Very disappointing to say the least."
4,Not impressed,"I had the same product for years, but it eventually wore out. This new one seemed great until Irealized the bottle of cleaner that came with it, leaked all over the inside of the box. So I didnot get to use the cleaner ( obviously ) Also there was alot of dirt on the scrub brush. I assume thismay be due to the item having been previously returned and NOT cleaned up? Dissapointed to say the least.Giving it four stars because the actual product works well"
2,You'll have to replace it every year or so,"This is my 3rd Little Green Machine in the last 5 years. I love it when it's working and when it's working, it works well. But I continually have the same problem and this time I've decided to look for something else. This is getting too costly and too frustrating to deal with when you have something you need to clean asap and it decides it's going to be the same day it decides not to work. RRRRRrrrrr!"
1,Bissell Little Green Bites,"It worked twice, if you want to count the second time when it stopped working, but I kept fooling with it because I wanted it to work. I spent more time taking it out of the box, and putting it together. Its a chew toy now. It would have been nice if it vacuumed too. it was the most expensive mistake I've made this year."
3,"OK but messy, while it still works","The water spray comes out pretty far behind the suction area, so you have to spray first if you're attempting to clean a small area. No big deal I guess, but the spray can get messy. The suction could be stronger. The solution is heated, but the heater on mine broke within two months from the purchase date."
4,Great if you are housebreaking a puppy,"My wife and I have used this carpet cleaner extensively over the past few years. We bought it when we got two beagle puppies that were a little difficult to housebreak. This carpet cleaner has come in very handy for all of those little surprises. We've had this for about four years now and it is still going strong. Be sure to clean it out every time you use it. I'm guessing the negative reviews are from those who didn't read the manual and keep this thing cleaned out between uses. I'm giving it four stars as the turbo brush is a waste of time. The rotating turbo brush is powered by the vacuum and therefore greatly reduces the suction power. It might have been a good idea if it were powered by an electric motor. You can throw that brush away. However the non-powered brush does a good job, and we still are using this tool on accidental spills years after the puppies have grown."
3,"ok for the job, but leaks","This device leaks all over the place, the gasket ring at the bottom of the dirty canister is cheap, and the way the unit is designed, there is also a leak underneath the clean water canister. So I took some Blue RTV from PEP BOYS and made my own silicon gasket and sealed up the entire bottom. I then used electrical tape to seal the 4 open holes underneath the clean canister and one open hole underneath the dirty canister. You can email at ruiz.jose0305@yahoo.com for a picI agree with other reviewers, the heater hardly warms up the water"
2,Triple bummer. the heater stopped working,"This is our second Little Green + Heat. We really liked the first one, no problems with clogging or anything. After four years of yeoman duty, the vacuum hose started to crack a little, right where the hose connects to the machine. Not a big deal, we used duct tape and it's holding up well. We decided to get a second one for upstairs and to retire the first.The heater stopped working on it's tenth use or so, bummer. Checked to see if heater was clogged, it was not - double bummer. The easy return window passed about 10 days ago - triple bummer. Five stars for the first one.This one is going back, even if I lose a little money on it. Although we like and use the first one, we're disappointed that the new one failed after such a short time. three stars - while it worked, it was great."
3,it leaks,I love the way it cleans but with leak it put the stain in another place where the cleaner sits. it took about four time to fixs with a GOOP sealer. works great now..
2,does not last a longtime,I bought a green machine about 5 years ago for pet stains etc. Yhis worked well to get out the stains however through use it stopped sprayin. I purchased anothert one and used it twice.well it broke as the sprayer continued to spray and their was no suction. My parents had on my brother borrowed it for his stairs and it also broke. My parents did not use their machine much at all. I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN. I am going to try the spot Bot and hope I have more luck!
4,little green machine,"Have wanted to get one of these for some years and now that we have a handicapped dog who sometimes has mistakes in the house, it was time we got one.....like the idea of the steam cleaning as I feel that this digs deep into the carpet and cleans out the down deep stuff.....we used it shortly after getting it in the mail and it did a great job.....used the pet cleaner with it and it was a miracle worker for us....."
2,Mine Leaks,"I've had this product for a few years now, and went to use it to spot clean sweet potato out of the rug (2 year old ;) ). Well, I got it cleaned up and then looked at the unit, and saw a huge amount of filthy water pooling into the rug from around the base of the unit. Clearly it was leaking. Never had this problem before so a search of the symptoms on the internet brought me here to amazon where I see that these indeed have this problem. Mine suddenly started doing it after a few years. Personally I expect a more durable product for the money but I did get a few years out of it. It hasn't really been as effective as I would like either at removing pet stains. We can still see them after it dries on our berber carpet. I expected more out of this product, sorry Bissell."
1,Yours too will quit working- I guarantee it!,"For all of those who gave this product 5 stars, I offer this predction. It will work great for a year or two-depending how often you use it, and then one day it will quit spraying. It happened to my original Bissell little green, and being an optimist, I bought another one. It also quit spraying after 18 months of use. Bissell's advice to unplug the sprayer with a paperclip will not work either.For a company that produces expensive products that quit working after 18 months and are expensive to repair to make another similar product labeled ""earth friendly"" is a joke. I can't even fathom how many of these little green machines are in landfills. It's inexcusable."
2,"Bare minimal parts work, the rest (heat, turbo br.)broke quickly","I can really only add my voice to the others here, mine has broken in significant ways rather quickly. The heat broke first, then the turbo brush stopped being able to suck the liquid back up, so now I have to use the tiny brush, which takes more time, and more effort. This is important to me, because I have a disability that limits my strength and stamina. The bottom is also leaking now, which I discovered when I found the water marks/damage on the floor of my coat closet where I store it.Despite all of this, I would recommend anyone with kids, pets, or an accident prone family member, to purchase a similar piece of equipment. I think I would go with the one the other review said his vacuum repair guy suggested. Hoover SteamVac Jr. I think it was. I will definitely buy another myself, but it will not be this piece of poo poo again."
5,Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful,"This little machine is truly amazing. Talk about some power in this little thing. I just cleaned my entire two bedroom apartment with this! Course, I had to make many many trips to refill, empty and I was on my hands and knees for the duration, but I tell you, it's worth it. This thing is awesome. I used it on my upolstry and it was great yet again. I highly recommend. This will save me tons of money, and I am sure it'll save you money too."
1,Murphy,"This is terrible cleaner, no power. you mite as well use your kitchen sponge. Makes a lot of noise with limited results. I had the large bissell cleaner and it worked great. Don't waste your money."
2,I would not recommend this,"Sprayer plugged up all of the time. I thought it might have been the detergent I was using, so I just would fill it up with clean water. But, it still plugged. It takes about 10 minutes to fix, but what good is that when you need it. I got so mad at this thing the last time, I threw it away."
1,"Doesn't clean, just dampens the rug","I was extremely disappointed with this product. Given some of the rave reviews, I was expecting at least decent results. I found that it just dampened my rug. The machine is just strong enough to show the water splashing about inside the nozzle head, but it's not strong enough to actually fully suck it out of the rug and into the canister. It just doesn't have enough power to clean the rug effectively. The result is that you've spent $90 on a machine that leaves you with a wet and dirty rug. You're better off taking it to the dry cleaner, renting one of those professional cleaning machines, or spending a couple of dollars on a spray cleaner that you let dry and then vacuum up with your regular vacuum."
4,Bissell Little Green Proheat Turbo cleaner is a real pro.....,"Bissell 1425B Little Green Proheat Turbo Carpet CleanerI purchased the Bissell 1425B Little Green Proheat Turbo Carpet Cleaner because I needed something to clean my sofa. My daughter has 2 puppies and one of them had an accident on my sofa. I also have cats and one of them got sick an the sofa. I am also the mother of 5 kids so needless to say things have been spilled on the sofa. The Proheat Turbo worked amazing it saved me from having to buy a new couch.It cleans terrific and dried in just a few hours. I DO NOT REGRET BUYING THIS PRODUCT.The only reason this product got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is very difficult to clean the back of the sofa because the machine leaks if you hold the brush up/down, but on flat surfaces it is a must for pet owners and parents."
4,Good,Item was as expected. Received on time with no problems. Steelers rule. Steelers rule go go go go go steelers
5,My new favorite towel,"I'm really happy with the quality of this towel. And I was surprised at how big it was! I really need to start reading product descriptions more :) Anyway, the logo is perfect, the colors are vibrant, and the towel is soft. It's perfect for the Steelers fan that's also a fan of the beach/pool."
2,Not accurate enough,"The book is Ok, but not quite there. There are interviews from Pro Pinochet people and familiars of the dissapeared. However, I would also have liked to see the opinion of a person whose relatives where killed by communist guerrillas. Also, at the end of the book she tries to portray Allende as the good and Pinochet as the bad guy. That shows she is one sided. Well, Politzer was the head of campaign of Chile's current socialist president Ricardo Lagos and she has her own views but I think she still has some emotions in her that don't let her see what happened in Chile with full neutrality."
4,leaves you wondering,"This was a bit different book for the author, it left things open ended, both in the case and her personal life. It was a good story, believable. I am surprised the next book isn't a continuation, but sometimes it is better that way. let you figure out the ultimate ending"
5,Excellent as always,I have all of the Kinsey books in hardback and read this when it originally came out. I'm now trying to get them all on my Kindle. I usually read the whole Kinsey series A-V every year. J is for Judgement is one of the best. I read a lot of mysteries and I think Kinsey is the best character in contemporary fiction today.
3,J is for Juicy,"Solid Read! J is for Judgment does not disappoint fans of this series. There are lots of juicy relationships to explore in this novel (Wendell & Dana, Wendell & Renata, Michael & Juliet etc.) The ending of the novel ties up most of the loose ends but I would have liked the story to follow-up more with the Jaffe Family and Detective Harris Brown. Were there any reprecussions for the retired police officer's involvement in the money scandal? I guess the novel has to end somewhere! Overall it's worth the read if you enjoy this series of novels. I also found the section on Kinsey's family history an interesting addition to the novel."
3,curious only when paid?,"The plot of this book was interesting enough, but I was left wondering why Kinsey Milhone was so incurious about her own family. If part of her name is all over the place, why didn't she have any information at all about them? And then to have one of her cousins turn into a dea ex machina? How convenient."
4,Where is Wendall Jaffe? Did He Fake His Own Death?,"Kinsey Millhone has to solve the case of what happened to Wendall Jaffe. Did he fake his own death in order to defraud theinsurance company? Kinsey spends most of the book trying to put the clues together and runs into trouble along her way.I enjoyed the book and found it a good read, though not as good as some of the others in this series."
1,Lame detective,"The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all. The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case. How does she resolve her dilemma? By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity. Lame! And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere. I don't know what ""K"" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out."
4,Wonderful Suspense,What a spectacular tale. Sue Grafton does it again with another great mystery. Well done.If only there were a follow upt to the story
2,Just a testimony,"It's an OK book I guess. It isn't so much about baseball as it is about this man's journey in life toward faith. He was a big baseball fan and so most of his stories of growing up have to do with baseball. Not really a sermon, but an OK testimony."
3,Ok but not enough,"It is a good book, but I feel it is still not it. Pictures are thousand words and a lot can be said through them. Some of the pictures are good but some not great and some fail to convey what you want to see or what to show. I would expect somthing more, some kind of enchanting realism from the graphics, something that can tell me what I want to hear through the eyes, transport me to a world where everything else seems non existent or if it just existed for only two of us, back into the memory lane some place where the time stops."
1,Halloween Costume,"Fast delivery, but was not the size i order =(. Too late to order a new one so i had to wear a costume from last year."
4,Tale of opportunities,"A psychological drama of being rejected by other work-seekers and betrayed by the loved preferring money and social status rather than family values of a modern world.Actually, it is hard to believe somewhere in the world such a selective process exists at all as protectionism and xenophobia ruled even less technologically advanced enterprises than one depicted."
4,Surprisingly good,"Terrific acting and a taut, boardroom drama. Almost all the action takes place on one set, enclosed, rather claustrophobic, but very effective. Good script, direction and acting."
2,Not Good........,"Ok, the only reason I saw this movie is because Jeremy Sisto! is in it. Him and his performance is the only reason I rated this movie 2 stars. Elizabeth Hurley does give somewhat of a good performance but overall, I found this movie both boring and confusing at times. Not a horror movie. Only worth the rental fee if you are a Sisto fan!"
3,Aspect Ratio,Just to let prospective buyers know that the widescreen aspect ratio is not set for 16:9 TV screens. You get a small picture with black bars on both sides and top and bottom. Sloppy DVD authoring.
2,NOT CONSISTENT WTH R-RATING,"This product was rated R , and so I wanted to witness sexy scenes of Liz hurley. But there were none to my dismay. So it was really mis-leading to rate this product as ""R"".Are nude scenes shown in ""Unrated"" Movies.If so, then only I will procedd with purchase of DVD s' in future."
1,Poorly researched,"This book is a badly written report. Firstly, it focuses mainly on only two roma groups, the Finnish Kaale and Canadian gypsies. Despite this, the author is too afraid to say anything specific, so most results of breaking any gypsy laws are left vague and unspecified. Second, many things are excluded in the explanations and research, such as women's roles and things like Divanos and Bandoliers. The book also glances at women's and family roles, and does not address any actual taboos broken or transgressions perpetuated. I found nothing like the information in the summary, all of which can be found in five seconds from reliable sites using google."
2,Does not match summary on back of book,"This book was nothing like what I expected after reading the summary on the back of the book.The summary makes it sound like the hero (Tag) has a wild journey across the Highlands (""Travelling alone through the Scottish highlands, the man who dissects other cultures for a living is completely out of his element in this one. Eccentric locals. Lethal-strength ale. Scary sheep."") It sounded like a fun, light, sexy romp.In fact, it's a very claustrophobic tale where nearly the entire story takes place in four locations (Tag's father's home, a rental car, an inn, and the castle where Maura lives) and significant portions of the story are played out in the minds of the two lead characters (as other reviewers have done a great job of describing).I've read a couple of short stories from this author (but not the ones that tie into this story) and I have enjoyed them. I'm willing to read more from this author, but I just can't recommend this book."
2,Story in need of a plot,"At the reading of his estranged father's will, prodigal son Tag discovers that he is the owner of a castle in rural Scotland. He travels to the highland country to sell the estate, and literally bumps into a sexy stranger and has a one night stand on a cold winter night.Who would have thunk that the sexy stranger would be Maura, the woman running the run down Scottish castle? Over the course of the next 250 pages, the two basically just have lots of steamy sex, with a couple of conversations and boring narrative thrown in that don't add much to the story, as they debate on the true ownership of the estate.I was really disappointed; usually I am impressed with Kauffman's storytelling (her only other miss for me was ""Cinderella Rules""). Rather than spend money on this one, check it out at the library. My copy will be available at a garage sale near you soon."
4,A must have for your Ben10 fanatic - if your kid likes Ben 10 this rocks!,The episodes are on this disc:Vengenace of Vilgax Part 1 and Part 2InfernoFools GoldBonus: Don't fear the RepoBonus: SinglehandedThat's 4 regular and 2 extra episodes. We have collected all the Ben 10 DVD's. I can't say I am happy with the fact that they stopped producing the Season compilations that they used to do for Ben 10- clearly this is all money related as the season sets were 13 episodes for about fifteen bucks or so and these are the same basic cost for 1/4 to 1/3 the epi's. That's disappointing but from a business standpoint I can see it.Ben 10 Alien Force is my son's favorite series - as was Ben 10. Now he's on to Ben 10 Ultimate Alien and loving it as well. The only reason for the 4 stars is that whole season set issue. Otherwise the quality of the epi's is very good (we have standard definition TV). For Ben 10 fans it's a must purchase!
2,Dissapointed,"When the dvds arrived I did not watch all of the many performances in the first 30 days. Because of a manufacturing defect, some of the performances on one disc froze and were unwatchable. I contacted Warner Bros. twice but never received a response. All I wanted was replacement of one disc. I sent an email to Oldies, the company that filled my order. Oldies responded that they would not do anything because more than 30 days had elapsed. I am not blaming them for the problem. I do blame them for not providing decent customer service.I certainly blame Warner Bros. for not standing by their products. I will never do business with either of them again. Caveat Emptor!"
4,Pushing Tin not Anamorphic as stated,"I bought the Angelina Jolie Collection in Canada. All three DVDs were listed as anamorphic on the cover, but ""Pushing Tin"" was not presented in anamorphic widescreen as stated.I wonder if the version released at the States has the same issue.Besides that, a good package for the price."
4,"Good value, but very few extras . . .","3 movies for the price of 1. But is it worth it? > you be the judge. I assume you know the movies, here's what you get on each disc.Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) PG-13 (slim case)- Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1- Deleted Scenes- Commentaries by Director Doug Liman and Screenwriter Simon Kinberg, Producers Lucas Foster and Akiva Goldsman, Film Editor Micheal Tronick- ""Making a Scene"" Featurette- Trailers and moreLife or Something Like It (2002) PG-13 (slim case)- 2 sided with both Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1 and Full Screen 1.33:1- Commentary by Director Steven HerekPushing Tin (1999) R (slim case)- Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1- Original Theatrical Trailer"
5,Angelina Jolie Celebrity Pack,Angelina Jolie Celebrity Pack (Mr. & Mrs. Smith / Life or Something Like It / Pushing Tin) is excellent movie.
4,Excellent reference,"This book is exactly what it claims to be - a pictorial archive. For descriptions or details, Dover has a wide selection of books that will be of immense help with materials, construction, and history. For those who already have a working knowledge of the century in fashion, this book is a candy store of visual tidbits.Just a note: very few fashion illustrations of the nineteenth century were colored; hand-coloring was a labor-intensive process reserved for high-end publications with limited runs. Check my Listmania list for some books with color illustrations."
2,Shoes hats and fashion Dover Pictorial Archives Series,"There is a great need for reference material of the past. particularly the 1900`s through 50`s. This publication had some good illustrations but there were no references as to source, just a time period and thus only of general backgroud reference. . I also found that many of the images were common available images elsewhere. The low price made the purchase an acceptable member of my reference library even if it be only for tracking down better information from other more detailed resources of the images that were shown. Phillip Nutt"
2,the cover says it all,"I was not happy with this one, the whole book looks just like the cover. No real information inside, just a collection of drawings."
4,"Good, but other flavors are better","Nature's Gate makes great products, and this tooth gel is no exception. This product works well - it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling fresh. I prefer the Wintergreen-flavored gel over this one - it seems a little smoother and mintier. For anyone who is used to regular toothpaste/gel (Colgate, Crest, etc.), and is looking to transition to a product that is healthier for the body and the environment, this is a good choice."
1,Contains glycerin,"As far as I can tell, all of Nature's Gates natural toothpastes contain glycerin. GLYCERIN (synthetic)(MSDS) draws moisture from inside the skin, and holds it on the surface for a better ""feel"". Listed on MSDS as hazardous."
3,I Wanted to Love This But Didn't,"I really wanted to love this toothpaste but didn't. It has a funky flavor and an even funkier texture. I ordered the 6 pack, so we're now stuck with 5 more tubes of this. I do like the Nature's Gate mint tooth PASTE that we purchased from here on Amazon though. I thought that that's what I was ordering again when I ordered this, but missed the ""gel"" part. So my mistake. Overall it's not hideous, but it's none of our favorites either."
5,I love this Bible,"I have to keep saying it ""I love this Bible"" my sister has this Bible and is how I first became aware of it, because we had to do a written assignment for our Ministry, it became cyrstal clear that I was at a diadvantage with my Bible! All Bibles meet the demand for reading, but for clarity, study and history the ""NEW POSSIBILITIES THINKERS BIBLE"" is a good source!"
1,Very OLD recording,"I did not know or pay attention to the fact that this is an old, old recording. This would be of interest to someone with historical interest, but not to me. I just wanted to explore some more of Hahn's beautiful sounds. Couldn't get to the sounds with all that old background. I gave the recording away, the first chance I had, to a pianist."
1,False Customer Service and not as stated,I sent an honest feedback about the poor packaging and how my book arrived damaged and not as described. For some reason it never made it on the review list. This seller seems to spend time writing the reviews himself. Don't waste your money with this seller.
1,not as described,I ordered a copy of Word Wealth and what I received was the Teacher's Manual for word wealth; this was not in the description. I would have returned it but the cost of return shipping would cost almost as much as the low price I paid for the used book.
5,A FAN FROM INDIANA,"I found this group when listening to an Mp3 station by the band Farewell to Kings. The first song was Every Day which blew me away. After going to OMNIs site and listening to the other songs I bought the CD and found the entire CD to reveal astounding musicianship -- simple, complex, dark, light, raw, refined. It grabs you and won't let you go. Listening is like finding something you desperately were seeking but didn't even know it existed until it hits you square in the face."
5,Originality For Once,Good new sound with rock influences from tool and tight technical music influnce from King Crimson. Omni has great skill and original music that fills a dark void in this world of pro-tools and quantized computer generated rock music.
4,Omni review,"I love the artwork on Omni's CD. Minimal. Dark. Beautiful. **My favorite track:""Porcelain""Broken PiecesBroken PiecesLove the way you comprehendthe things you love and mean to mendPush it awaytake it awayLove the way you comprehendthe things you hate and mean to endpush it awaytake it awayDisconnected falling from gracethus it seems to me alwaysyour eyes are wet but thenyou're as hollow as porcelainDon't you worry 'bout a thingdisapointment is a nasty stingpush it awaytake it awayall this only goes to showto care is to pain so let it gopush it awaytake it awayDisconnected falling from gracethus it seems to me alwaysyour eyes are wet but thenyou're as hollow as porcelainrock on * * *caryn"
4,Kids loved this!,"My kids love to pretend they are ""working at home"" like mommy. Lots of fun and very durable."
5,Perfect addition to our dollhouse,"My 34 month old daughter was THRILLED for her dolls to get computers just like Mommy & Daddy use. This is now one of the most popular ""sets"" in her entire dollhouse. As always, the Loving Family toys never cease to amaze me with attention to detail. My daughter appreciates that."
4,Had to purchase for myself,"I picked it up at the library, but after only a brief read I have to buy it for myself. I'll use the library book until it arrives... then send it back to the library for someone else on the path! This was in the NEW BOOKSsection, hooray for my librarians!"
3,A Somewhat Unique Work,"This book is somewhat unique in the field of introductory magical books in that it doesn't really deal with history or provide multitudes of rituals. It focuses instead on slowing and steadily building up a bedrock of foundation for a spiritual practice. On one hand, this is somewhat off-putting to me, as it seems to take far too long to get to even the most elementary ritual practices, but on the other, this might be a good approach for a total and absolute beginner. Personally, I shelved this book and never did much with it."
1,A little quality control is needed.,"When my first base arrived I noticed that one of the rear wheel assembly welds was not attatched. I returned it to Amazon and in two days recieved a replacement. The replacement had the exact same problem! I contacted the HTC company and they were ready to blame it on shipping. Both boxes arrived in perfect shape. There is no way this happened due to a shipping problem. If it can't survive the shipping process, it will never sustain a 300+ lb jointer sitting on it. If the welds were sound it might be a pretty good mobil base. I returned the second one as well. It looks like the HTC company could use a little quality control, or a better welder. Overall a frustrating experience."
1,Won't read Lexar,"This universal Digital media reader is not so universal. It will not read Lexar Memory sticks. I emailed customer service with no response. I finally called customer service. ""They might come out with a patch sometime"" was their response.And they have no idea when. Don't waste your time!!!"
2,Link for Lexar firmware update please,I am also having trouble in reading Lexar 128MB memory stick. On Dazzle / Zio website I was not able to get firmware update. I am using Windows 2000 so can somebody post a link to firmware update on zio's website>
4,Problems with Lexar Media have been resolved...,"I encountered the same problems with a Lexar 128MB memory stick that have been mentioned by other reviewers. I discovered that dazzle has a firmware update for this reader available on their website. I downloaded, installed and ran the firmware updater and have had no problems with the reader since.There's not much more to say. I wish the cord was about 2 feet longer. I have my USB hub on the floor, and the cord is barely long enough to reach --- and the reader is at the back of the desk. If it was a bit longer, I'd be able to pull it closer to the keyboard when I'm using it."
2,Doesn't work with Lexar media,The Dazzle reader doesn't work with my 128MB lexar stick. But it works fine with my 128MB sony stick and my 128MB sandisk stick. The lexar stick works fine in my camera and in my hp officejet's reader. I'd stay away from this reader.
5,Very Good price for a very cool item!!,"This Dazzle Memory Stick Reader doesn't just read. It is also a Writer. This means that after copying the pictures from your memory stick to your PC and then deleting the originals on your memory stick, when you change your mind that you actually wanted them on your memory stick, you can write them back on your memory stick by dragging them to the memory stick's folder. [And it costs less than one my friend got that] does the same thing. This item also comes with a free Slideshow creator that you can burn pictures on a CD-R and play them on a DVD player. It is worth the price. I had absolutely no problem with it and I just plugged it in and got going. I highly recommend it."
2,If you wear a watch forget It,I tried to make this useful many times but after 4 years It's the only Item I ever sent back to Amazon.If you wear a watch on the arm you use I negates the use of the wrist pillow.My advice pass these by. There Is not enough mouse pad to move around at times.
4,Skechers Morpheus Sneaker,"Great price. Just as pictured, and size was true. Good all around casual shoe. Not great arch support so not for long walks, but around town or house a good strong shoe. Seems well constructed and sole seems durable."
3,"Good to look at, average in comfort","The shoes were pretty good to look at even though I wanted a different color, which sold out pretty quickly.Lookswise: The shoe has a rugged look and with the sole design, it is pretty cool. The color is likely to show dirt rather quickly and thus will require frequent cleaning.Comfort: The shoes fit my feet pretty well from the day one onwards, however they do not have much cushion in the soles and hence walking for long distances or standing for a long time causes feet aches.However, after wearing them for over a month, I can say that they are overall average becausePros: They are lighter than average sneakers and are good to look at.Cons: Not much cushion in the soles."
4,Good but too loose,Got these to be hip as I'm always wearing sneakers or shoes. I like them but the laces are too loose and I have to redo them 2-3 times a day.I removed 1* cause of the looseness of the laces.
5,Near Occasions of Grace,"Another book by Richard Rohr that exceeded my expectations, and I usually have high expectations for Richard Rohr. Well worth reading, and keeping around. We all need to be more aware of the presence of our Creator God around us."
2,"Good book, bad audio sounds","If you have a choice between the paperback and audio of True Courage, I would recommend the paperback. This audio CD has a male voice that seems too ""acted."" Also, sound effects and music have been added (keys jangling, annoying beepings for pagers, phones ringing, ominous music, etc.), and they really distract you from the story and your own imagination. Definitely go for the paperback."
4,Pleased,"Pleasant read - would recommend. I've read all the other Dee Henderson books and this one is better than the final O'Mally series book - but not quite as good as some of the earlier Henderson books. As a part of the Uncommon Heroes series - which so far had all centered around the military and shared characters between the books - I was suprised that this book is non-military and shares no ties with the previous three books in the series. Plot does keep moving, although you don't get to understand what drives the ""hero"" as well as in previous books."
3,Courage amd Finding Romance,"The book starts out a little slow or at first boring but than 2/3 way into it the book really picks up as Luke Falcons close family members are kidnapped in seperate cars , and a young boy runs into the woods to save his own life and is later found by the search dogs and rescuers , as Luke contiues to look for Sharon and Mark (The boys mom and adopted father) . Sharon returns but then her sister Caroline is taken hostage by the kidnappers annd Luke must now find the her and in the process he realizes he truly loves Caroline but does he find her in time ? Sorry you gotta read to find out the ending as well as so much more detail on the kidnappings ..."
5,cute!,"very cute! kind of hard for 4 and under to pull the stroller from single to double, but they love it!"
3,Nice Furniture to add to Dora's House,My little one loves to play with the twins. This furniture pack is a great addition to the house.
3,Welcome Additions,"I purchased the Dora the Explorer Talking House Christmas 2005. It was a big hit with my than 3 year old daughter. I 've since added the nursery extension to the house. When the Twin's Furniture set came along, I included it on the Christmas 2006 shopping list. My daughter really enjoys the set. My only issue is that pieces (i.e. rocking horse and stroller) are not designed to securely accomodate the twin siblings."
4,24 illustrations by Leon Carre,This used Franklin Library edition has 24 color illustrations by the illustrator known as Leon-Georges-Jean-Baptiste Carre (Leon Carre)and 769 pages of text.I picked one up for about $30-40.00 and find it worthwhile for the beautiful illustrations: I think I have identified about 20 or so illustrations that also appear in 'minature' in the Lo Scarabeo Tarot of the 1001 Nights.I wish the card deck had the larger illustrations that this used book has!I also wish there was a collector's edition of the 80 or so colored plates of Leon Carre that was supposed to be in the original 12 volume gift set published in Paris so long ago. His work is beautiful and evocative...
3,its ok,this dvd has 3 episodes match of the millennium parts 1-2 and aftermath yugi finishes dueling peguses and wins of course then theris aftermath where yugi meets shadi the keeper of the millennium key who travels in yugis mind and sees that yugi has his other side yami.
3,very nice,this looked like a great product. It just didn't fit me well as I thought it would. I would however still do business with where it came from(herroom)because I've ordered from them before and they've always been great.
2,Returned.,"I'm a 34 DD, the cups fit perfectly. However that was not the problem. The waist area clinched so tight that it gave me a muffin top. This is what I was trying to avoid. I feel longline bras are better past the bellybutton area then ending at it. If you are super thin it should not be a problem. I'm a size 2-4 in the waist area & about 5'3"", shorter torso."
2,Bad Fit For Bigger Bust,"I am a 34D. Wearing a strapless has always been impossible for me because it would just fall down.I tried on a Dominque longline bra in a bridal store and loved it! I unfortunately ordered the wrong style number when ordering this bra.When I put this bra on, the space in the front between the cups gapped away from my body. Thus, not giving me any support. I think this is because of the low back. That being said, I returned and the company had great customer service! They included a return shipping label as well.Secondly, I ordered the correct Dominque strapless long line that reaches the whole way to the top of hips versus mid waist. This is perfect!! There are 14 eye hooks in the back versus 3 eye hooks (on this one). I need more support, so this is great for me. I recommend it!"
1,found this in the garbage,"it looked like someone wiped their butt with it, so i didn't read much of it. what little i read was very poorly written and could almost pass a sort of twisted joke.McHam clearly has no place teaching or writing about journalism. this shouldn't even be called a book at a whopping 91 pages."
5,WOW! I am now a Case Files addict.....,"I wholeheartedly reccommend Case Files : Ob/Gyn by Toy. I was actually on Ob/Gyn at St. Joseph's Hospital in Houston with Dr. Toy, and he went through the book case by case with us. This guy has truly been the best teaching attending I have ever been around. I plan to buy his books for every rotation they are available for from here on out.This book is golden. During the shelf exam, easily 50% of the questions were straight from the book! This book is ESSENTIAL to the Ob/Gyn rotation in the third year of medical school!"
5,A must-have for 3rd year OB/GYN rotation,This book helped me to honor my 3rd year OB/GYN rotation. I recommend it- easy reading with lots of pearls throughout. I just kept it at my bedside and read a few cases a night. I used this with Blueprints and was very prepared for the shelf exam.
4,"Excellent info, awkward editing","While the information is great, there could have been a lot more done in the editing process to clean up sentence and paragraph structure. In several instances the author will present multiple potential approaches to an issue but only cover one of the approaches."
2,Reach for Mediocrity,"I'm afraid I will have to agree with moviefan, Grell. This is a perfect example of why one's biography should not be written by a relative. As mentioned, the author oddly fails to mention within the pages that she is Harvey's sister in law. One can only assume that old family grudges or resentments lay behind what seems to be the author's distaste for her subject.There is precious little information on Harvey's films (barely a page on Darling) and most quotes from his co-stars are lifted from other biographies.The author would have made a wonderful source of information for a less biased and more talented biographer. I cannot recommend spending anything near full price for this bio, though I could justify a few dollars to read about Harvey's early life. Unfortunately, it is so clear that the author has an ax to grind, that I wasn't even sure her descriptions of Harvey's ""Mommy Dearest"" mother were accurate or the ultimate revenge against her own mother-in law."
4,enticing reintroduction to acoustic guitar,"I am an old acoustic music fan who drifted away. Acoustic Edge brought me back into the fold. Almost all of the cuts are solid strong pieces that reveal the power non-amplified music can have. I rediscovered old friends and found new ones. Richard Thompsons ""Beeswing"" is a soft etheral piece. Pat Donohue ""Pig Iron"" is a revelation. Overall it the album offers up strong pieces from musicians I automatically put in the acoustic folk category and surprising gems from musicians I put in the amplified pop/folk/jazz category."
5,"How appropriate he would edit this book: thank you, John!","I will actually begin reading this book this weekend. My only question before beginning: Did John Updike's own work make it in? After all, here is the greatest writer of short stories in American history. What a shame if he felt compelled to leave himself out for ANY reason."
2,Best American short storiesof the Century,"I really didn't like this selection of stories even if they have been assembled John Updike. They were too morose, unhappy, too long and sometimes obscure. John Updike is my favorite author. He could have put together a few upbeat or silly stories in amongst the gloom.Richard DeRycke"
3,Nice selection but could have been better.,"I am ambivalent about this collection. On one hand, each of the writers in this collection is famous for one reason or another, making this a very good record of our literary tradition for the last 100 years. On the other hand, these stories had to be culled from the Best American Short Stories annual, which is a limiting and somewhat misleading proposition for the consumer. Most readers, I suspect, will recognize the obvious omissions and curious substitutions this makes. However, there are some interesting gems that are well worth the read. I do recommend it, but don't believe the title. Think of this book as a good sampler."
2,Far from the Best,"Listening to these stories left me wondering whether Updike was putting us on. Many seemed more appropriate for a collection of the worst stories of the century rather than the best. Most are simply descriptions of things, often laboriously stylized, without plot, dramatic tension or point. Most of the protagonists are passive, shallow and uninteresting. Even the best of the bunch, ""The Things They Carried,"" isn't really a story, but rather a series of well-written and sometimes powerful vingettes. The poor quality of many of the narrators did not help."
3,"Some highlights, but the set doesn't really ""read"" that well","This is a nice collection with many great writers, but they are selected, I believe, not because they are particuraly powerful or flow well, but because they illustrate some subtlety of writing that Updike and Kenison want to illustrate. If it's the latter they're trying to do, they succeed. If you really want a set of short stories you can take with you on the train, bus or plane and enjoy, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,Used book failure,The book I ordered from Briguy 107 through Amazon was never delivered to me. I'm waiting for a refund.
1,a lamentable absence,The failure of the editors to include in this collection a story by the incomparable Peter Taylor is an omission of such serious proportions as to render the whole enterprise laughable.
3,Where's the current Pulitzer winner?,"The stories in this series are rich and evocative, especially the stories from the first half of the century. Most of the modern stories are very good too - Ann Beatie, Annie Proux, Lorrie Moore, Alice Munroe are all masters of their craft, though I was disappointed in the 1999 selection. Too bad Jhumpa Lahiri, the recent Pulitzer Prize winner, wasn't included, especially since I can't remember the last time a short story collection won such a prestigious honor. This seems like an unfortunate, yet serious, omission to an otherwise colorful collection."
4,Best American Short Stories of the 20th Century,"This book is loaded with very well written stories. Lots of dark stories but, well written. It behoves the reader to research the origin of some of them...intrigue. Worth the money and time but, couldn't read many at one time."
5,An Outstanding Compilation,"This is an excellent collection of American short stories. (Even the quality of the book itself - cover, pages, printing - is excellent.)I purchased a used book via Amazon from Hilltop Book Shop. What a pleasure. They delivered the book very quickly, shrink wrapped and carefully packed. It was described as in ""very good condition"" but it looks new to me."
5,Just a great book,"The stories are engrossing, and very interesting, This is a must buy for all avid readers, and younger ones!"
3,Will work,"If you plan on installing this yourself, I caution you to take it slow. The instructions are slightly confusing, but manageable"
2,Good response but POOR control.,"It holds up well, its seems durable and it has well working buttons. But it has a terrible problem with the directional buttons: It's tilted a little bit trying to go for an ergonomic design but it fails terribly and causes you to go down when you are trying to go left. Thats really the only problem, but it is a major handicap and is aggravatin. This makes it almost useless, I find the keyboard gives me better control."
5,"Terrific poems for baseball fans of all ages, but especially charming for kids!","What a lot of charm packed into a slim collection of original poetry plus a bonus essay.Who can resist a piece entitled ""Walking Back to the Bench"" which goes ""If only I could tie my laces/I'd bet I could get more stolen bases."" A longer poem celebrates a dad's baseball mitt. And the title poem is all about dreaming of having one's own name on the walls of the Hall of Fame. From these and all the other gems in this collection, it's clear the author knows what people of all ages love about playing the great game of baseball.But, to be clear, the poems are not just about baseball. One of my favorites covers what monkey's dream about (bananas, of course!).Hannah Edelson's schoolgirl drawings make the work even more wonderful.I'd buy this book for anyone from age 5 - 55!"
2,Try Another not worth wasting five bucks on!,"This book is more like an essay on swinging. Considering that it only [was fairly inexpensive] and only has 56 pages, I didn't expect much. However, it was even lower than my expectations. I felt it lacked content and the authors provided little factual information to support the lifestyle they were trying to promote. The ten reasons they give to consider swinging is pathetic. The real stories they provide are oddly placed throughout the book and hardly worth reading. Even as an introductory book on swinging I would barely consider it acceptable. I think this book was intended to be a precursor for the other book they wrote. Honestly I would recomend someone skipping this one for another book with more content."
4,Truly unique and useful,"While there are several good books about swinging (the best being Terry Gould's The Lifestyle) and for swingers (the best being Together Sex and Receational Sex), I don't think that any others are anywhere near as good for giving to another couple to introduce them to swinging. Considering Swinging is small and cheap but looks nice so the new people you give it to won't be ashamed to read it on the subway. And it works!"
2,Needs more content,"This VERY BRIEF booklet doesn't offer anything new or particularly insiteful. In my opinion, there are three pubs worth reading/seeing if you are thinking about the lifestyle: Recreational Sex by Patti Thomas, The Lifestyle by Terry Gould, and Dr. RObyn's video, Swing Lessons. Leave this turkey in the freezer."
3,Lock-up central!!,"Cons:a)Bad Hard Drive Partition,which makes the hard drive feel even smaller.b)Bad Battery Life.c)Locks-up frequently.d)A lot of useless software.e)So so customer service.f)Modem problems.Pros:a)When it works, is a pretty decent, basic computer.Next time I will go with pentium or centrino, with a bigger hard drive and DVD-R."
1,Worst computer ever,"If your are looking for a good used laptop..........look elsehwere. The FXA47 is loaded with software and problems and VERY POOR customer support. In the 2 years we have had it, it has stayed in the case most of the time because of lockups. I have restored it several times to original configurations with no help. Sony is clueless and wants to charge for phone supoport and has only responded to 1 of my e-mails. It seems that everytime we install software the computer wants to lock up. My Compaq 2715US works great with out any problems. I will never by another Sony product."
2,The worst customer service and a poor computer,"The FXA47 is a sleek machine and when it works, it is wonderful.I run a number of machines with XP and all perform better than this laptop, especially my Dell laptop.The FXA47 hangs repeatedly when using standard programs such as the microsoft office family. Frequent crashing makes the computer nearly useless.This is my second FXA47; the first was replaced due to these same problems to no avail. Beware!"
1,Frasier DVD 6th season and most others,These don't seem to be authentic DVD's. We purchased several and they all seem to jump and stop. We just gave up on the 4th DVD of Season 6. Who is selling Amazon these Frasier DVD's?
5,A Great Season of Frasier,"I truly find every episode a delight to watch and some are hysterically funny. And it is just so much better to view without commercial interruption. I have every season available and they are treasures I will be able to view again and again, over time.Well worth the investment, new or used if you a fan of Frasier.And it is fun to watch in sequence, season by season, to see the development of the characters and the progression of their ups and downs as they are meant to be seen.Most anxious to get Seasons 9 and 10 to complete my series.Terry, a most avid fan of Frasier"
5,Wonderful as ever!,"Really enjoyed seeing all the episodes from this season again. They made me laugh as much as they did the first time I saw them. My favorite episode this season has to be ""Three Valentines"" the scene at the beginning with David Hyde Pierce is CLASSIC!Only wish there was some ""bonus"" footage or goodies with this set."
5,5 stars,Always a big fan.Frasier is the best series ever.We will rewatch the intire series 3 or 4 times.Please always make them available
3,Not correct product be careful,I ended up returning this product twice because it comes in a standard dvd case not the box like all the other seasons. Amazon was very easy to work with when trying to return it and get a refund.
4,"trying too hard, so no cigar!","The lunacy begins bigger than ever in the aftermath of the unemployed. In episode one everyone dons new hairstyles and Frasier gains a lot of pounds in an episode that redefines `denial' but episode two fails miserably; Frasier overacts and the comedy is ridiculously broad! I don't know what the writers are thinking on this show sometimes; they set up some funny moments and then go too far in a very awkward manner and added to it is an unresolved and strange end to the episode ; this ain't no Will And Grace! `Hot Ticket' is another example of this; pompous, overdone and yet another attempt at a classic Frasier misunderstanding. The highlights are; Three Valentines, Roz a Loan, Secret Admirer, Merry Christmas Mrs. Moskowitz, The Good Samaritan, When A Man Loves Two Women, Maris`Divorce and the final two charming episodes save the season!"
5,great dvds,the sixth season has some funny episodes like when frasier gets arrested when he picks up a hooker? and freddy finds out about it. or when daphne has a vision of who she really needs to be with? could it be niles who knows you have to watch it
5,Frasier the Complete Comedy Ever,I have the entire Frasier collection. The writing and character chemistry is the best. I enjoy watching this series over and over. The best of personal entertainment for the money!
1,Doesn't work use traps,"I tried the repellent and gas bombs, the only thing that worked were the traps. You have to dig a hole but if you don't kill the gophers they will destroy your yard so a hole is no big deal.I used the Sweeney Gopher traps, they worked greatSweeneys 9013 Gopher Trap, 2-PackAs a follow up we have killed all the gophers on our 5 acres (at least the active ones), we did this in 3 days. We spent 3 months trying repellents and gas bombs."
3,Didn't Work For Me,"Moles still came back.In my experience, I would recommend the dry granules - easier to apply and probably the same or better effectiveness."
3,Wrinkle Free is not Wrinkle Wiz,Just so people are informed. Wrinkle free has been discontinued minus whatever left over stock is left. The picture displays wrinkle wiz which is a substitute for wrinkle free but it does not look like that blue can in the picture. It's actually a clear bottle and its similar but not totally the same. Just wanted to inform other buyers beware.
5,i do not know to press,"i do not know to iron press my clothes and i do not really want to learni use ""wrinkle free"" all the times, not only while traveling - every day, 10 seconds in front of the mirror: spray, pull on the garment, blow hair dryer ..et voila"
2,small,"I was surprised at this product, It was the same size as the travel size, I thought it would be bigger. Not much in the can for the price. Seems to work okay."
5,Wonderful !!!!!!!,"Very intense and beautiful videos, not to talk of the music!!!A jump into the past!"
2,Good for tranfers but crashes my computer.,"I like the fact that I can transfer the pictures I take with my digital camera without having to plug it into the PC. It is convenient, especially if you have several CF: you don't need to turn off your camera, switch the CF, turn on the camera... and so on.The only problem I have with this product is actualy when I am not using it. With the CF reader plugged into the USB port, my PC would crash anytime, without any reason. It took me some time before finding out that if I didn't leave the CF reader plugged when I wasn't using it, the problem would disapear. I still use the reader pretty often but I have to plug/unplug it every time.I use Win Me. I don't know where the problem comes from but I have several other devices on the USB ports and never had any problem with any of them.One last thing: that would be nice to have a LED to know when the CF is being read/written."
4,Gets the job done.,"I've had this reader for a couple months now, and it's worked without a hitch (under Win98). It's much much faster than the parallel reader I used to use. It's nothing fancy but it's worked for me really well."
1,Not what I ordered.....,"The seller was pleasant enough. I got a product similar to what I ordered, but for a MemoryStick instead of Compact Flash. It took several emails before I got a response. I was told to keep product and a refund would be given. Still haven't received the refund. I would make sure she has the product I wanted before I ordered. Seller was nice, though."
2,Dazzle Compact Flash Reader doesn't handle 64 MB chips,"The title says it all. The directory listing has lots of strange characters; consequently, I suspect it has flipped into 16-bit character mode. 8 MB chips work fine."
1,Unsatisfactory vendor,"This is supposed to be a universal burner, however, it did not fit into the main burner of my gas grill. I called the telephone number that was on the kit documentation but the number was disconnected and no other telephone was listed. It seems as though ""Grill Care"" is out of business and no one has taken over their customer service department. Therefore, I will not purchase any other gas grill item from ""Grill Care"" since"
4,"Good romance, interesting characters",The book was a fast read. The characters were the most interesting part. The woman is a chef and the man the lead detective. Both come to the relationship with plenty of baggage and a kid. The suspense left a little to be desired but all in all it was good and I DO recommend it.
2,Deadly Disscontent or disconect,"Christine Heggan poses the self aware restranteur Abbie Di Angelo against her sociopathic half brother, and later a thick headed strongman drug-dealing Arturo Garcia. First off, the story holds promise and I'm convinced that Ms. Heggan can weave a pot together. Bad guy number one really made me mad! I actually found myself steaming. Abbie Di Angelo made me angry for a different reason. I just wasn't buying the victimization of the seemly self-aware person. How could anyone this smart, and with such great people skills be this much of a doormat? I didn't put the book down at that point. I bought the romance and her devotion to Rose, the first bad guy's ex-wife. Nice touch. I related well with Rose's circumstances. I put the book down when Abbie was too dumb to call the police at her second Garcia sighting. The first sighting would have put, even the most stable person in the therapist's chair..."
5,Great gospel c.d.,"B.B King is the king of the blues. It is only natural to say he can sing Gospel better than most other singers. He takes the old time hymn ""Workin' on a building"" and works his blues laden magic on it. His interpretation of ""Swing low sweet chariot"" is truly an amazing intertpretation. If you are a Gospel listener than this cd may very well be for you. It is done traditionally in a plain, in your face, what you hear is what you get style.A quality that a lot of gospel or music in general is missing today. Rugged raw but trully inspiring."
1,It's B.B.; It's Gospel; It's Terrible,"Yes, this is B.B. King singing gospel favorites, but the sound quality is terrible. At first I thought someone got hold of the old analog masters and dubbed them to digital. Then I heard the distinctive pop of scratched records and realized this resulted from someone simply dubbing from vinyl. Tonal range is terrible - all midrange - and the vocals are deeply buried. If anything can make you appreciate the term ""remastered,"" this CD will do it."
1,Not so good,"I bought one before and it worked fine until I bent the metal piece, but the second one I bought did not work at all."
3,JUST MUSIC? THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR,This is an lp of just Simon's music with no words. It includes ads and themes and other eclectic work. Only for huge fans of Simon.
3,Cheap and loud! But gets the job done.,"I bought this product to inscribe my metal tools. I receive the package on time and very quickly...one star.The product works...one more star. The cons where its very loud! not just loud, VERY loud! wear hearing protection. The quality is cheap when i got it out the package the wire was already splitting into two in the middle. Will i recommend this product...yes if your doing small jobs. It gets the job done without spending lots of money...my third star."
3,a fair value,"I purchased this item to etch short text onto keys (e.g., GAR for garage, FD for front door, etc.) I could not adjust the speed control. As a result the etching was a bit ""rough"" but suited my needs."
4,What a bargain!,"I just bought this classic adventure (I owned the first edition years ago) for $8.98 in the used section. It was remaindered for some reason and shipping was free, so I bought this updated version. For $9 you have little reason to restrain your ""add to cart"" finger."
5,Refreshing And Beautiful Christmas Music,"I try to get at least one new Christmas CD every year, and this one is a winner. I enjoy the angelic and ethereal voices, and the celtic instrumentation on some of the tracks. The production is lush but not overdone, and it is the vocals and harmonies that shine. This is a CD I will get out every year and listen to again and again..."
4,Excellent voices.,"While the voices of Celtic Woman are amazing (that alone merits the four stars), and some of the songs on this album were excellent (such as the jazzy Let It Snow, which was a pleasant surprise), I wish I had been more familiar with the Christmas carols. This, however, is certainly not Celtic Woman's fault.One thing I was dissatisifed with was their rendition of Carol of the Bells. While somewhat pleasing on the grounds that it is my favorite Christmas carol, it did not have a very good arrangement and the whole piece seemed like a blur of background vocals and the nearly incoherent foreground ones.Overall, this album is good to listen to, and the quality of the singers cannot be denied, but it is better suited for background music and not very noteworthy."
3,Nice CD,"A Christmas Celebration by Celtic Woman is forty-eight minutes and fifty-sic seconds long and was released on October 3, 2006. The album reached #1 on the Top World Music Albums, #35 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts, #5 on the Top Holiday Albums, and #3 on the U.S. Billboard Top Pop Catalog. It is a nice, but not great CD. I would have preferred more Celtic Christmas songs or if they sang some of the songs in Gaelic. I just thought is needed more of a Celtic twist.

3,Okay..not the greatest,I didn't end up caring for it but my aunt did - would neither recommend nor discourage.
4,Celtic Charm,This Christmas CD is beautiful. The whole CD has expertly showcased Celtic Woman unique celtic style. I absolutely love this CD and will readily recommend it to all her fans.
4,Good music,"Good music, although I would much rather have had the gals include more traditional carols than some of the modern secular stuff."
4,Great CD,"The CD is all that I hoped it would be. However shipping took FOREVER, about 5 days longer than what was stated as the ""end range"" and the plastic CD case has several small cracks in it."
4,Celtic Woman,I am enjoying the Celtic music and learning through music about my distant Irish heritage. Distant meaning back about eight generations.
4,Excellent CD for the price,This will be one of the best Christmas CD's for a very long time. Great Price and excellent music. Thanks
5,These women can SING!,"This is a lovely holiday CD with a broad selection of music that I have greatly enjoyed. Other reviewers know each individual singer better than I do, so I won't ""go there"" -- you won't be disappointed in this."
2,What the...?,"This woman is singing ""Ave Maria"" -- it's LATIN, folks -- and she is rolling her R's like an opera star. WRONG. She has a lovely voice, but the endless r-r-r-r-r-rolling is maddeningly distracting."
2,celtic woman=christmas,this product was damaged before i purchased it. it was not in good condition. this was my first purchase at amazon and i guess my last.
1,"Overproduced, treacly cr*p","We adore Celtic music, and this bears no resemblance to the music we love. Listening to it right now because it just arrived and I paid for it, but it's destined for the thrift store."
5,Wonderful Christmas CD,"If you like Celtic Woman and also like to buy a new Christmas CD each year, then try this one. You won't be disappointed."
5,This is a good one,"My only exposure to Celtic Woman is through PBS, but I've heard and seen enough to know their music is breathtakingly beautiful. I haven't listened to all the tracks on this CD yet, but those that I've heard have not disappointed. The vocals are perfect, in some cases hauntingly so. The arrangements and orchestration are right there as well."
3,Nice but not great,"The voices of the Celtic Women singers are exquisite, but the arrangements on this record don't do them justice. There are several that shouldn't be missed. Tight harmonies on Merry Little Christmas, haunting That Night in Bethlehem, gorgeous Wexford Carol are the best of the lot. Guess I expected more Celtic tunes. It is quite shocking, and unpleasantly so, to have the blaring jazz horns blast at the start of Let It Snow after the quiet Wexford Carol and it ruined this CD for me."
3,Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration,"Although I think their voices are amazing and the music is beautiful, I expected carols and songs that are what we think of in this country as more traditional Christmas fare. I expected some Celtic tunes, but I thought there would be a predominance of regular Christmas carols. I still love the Celtic Woman music and will continue to follow them."
2,Christmas carols as lullabies,"This album is pleasant enough to to listen to especially if you want your young children to fall asleep. These ladies' voices are sweet but without much depth; their style gets old awfully quickly and in some hymns/songs such as Panis Angelicus, the rendition is inappropriate.Then again, in a stressful world, a Christmas collection to fall asleep to might not be a bad idea..."
4,Lovely!,"I've been buying Christmas albums almost every year but I don't listen to them a second time after buying them.This is the only one I enjoy immensely, for the purity of sound, as well as the angelic voices which bring to me the special atmosphere and meaning of Christmas."
5,YES,"Fantastic...frankly one of the best Christmas albums I own. Their first album was very good, but this one seems so well put together, and I can hardly point to a song that dropped the high standard set by the first few songs. My highlights: Holy Night, Christmas Pipes, Christmas Song, Carol of the Bells, Little Drummer Boy."
4,a christmas celebration,The variety was good. The acoustic and arrangement were not as good as I expected.
4,Bought this one for the originality of their sound,The accents add to the appeal of these tunes and the background music carries the melody around in my head.
5,"Celtic woman, or should be angelic voices",What a treat to listen to. The couple that I gave one disc to raved about how great it was.
3,Good music,It wasn't a bad album but i was expecting a better selection of songs to show their talent. Too Bad
5,A new family favorite for the holidays,This cd is excellent. These women sing so beautifully. We will be playing this cd for many holidays to come. They sing Christmas songs like they were supposed to be sung. There are a lot of so called singers out there that can learn from these women on how to sing and some that should NEVER be allowed to sing these songs EVER! We will buy more of there cds. My teen daughters also like them alot.
3,Its pleasing for the holidays,"I knew nothing of the television special, but this sounded nice. I was looking for some christmas music, something different, just something to play in the background. This isn't the best I've ever heard, but it's nice, with some ear catching songs among the lot. I recommend listening to the samples if they are available, that should give you an idea."
5,Great Celtic Woman Christmas album,"As usual, here's another great Celtic Woman performance. This is one I'll be pulling out to play each Christmas season. I love it!"
4,;pure voices,This disk shows all the reasons the Welsh are famous for their singers and choirs. It features pure clear voices with none of the cheap tricks of todays pop singers. These voices are perfectly exhibited with the familiar Christmas songs in this album.
4,I am ready to move to Ireland,"What beautiful voices. They can sing anything and make you want to sit back, relax, close your eyes and enjoy the music, the voices, the beauty. Of course a fine scotch also helps the mood."
4,"Good, but not what I expected...","I'm actually not familiar with Celtic Woman's other music, so I can't make a comparison, and my expectations were not based on their other stuff. I think because of the term ""Celtic"" I was expecting something more in the way of lively reels, but this CD mainly consists of peaceful, serene renditions of traditional and celtic carols/Christmas songs. That is not to say it is devoid of liveliness, because there are some lively songs, and there is a definite Celtic flavor to a few of the songs; but most of the music on this CD is much more traditionally ""Christmas,"" accompanied more often by an orchestra or piano than a fiddle and flute. It is quite beautiful, and makes a great addition to any traditional Christmas collection."
5,Just keep getting better,I bought Celtic Woman Home for Christmas and Celtic Woman A Christmas Celebration at the same time. Both are excellent. Recommend both if you are looking for inspiring music for the Christmas season.
4,Good Christmas music,I like the sound and the harmonies. Just right for the Christmas traditional music. I gave it for Christmas presents this year
4,Celtic Woman Christmas Album,"Orla, Chloe, Meav, Lisa, and Mairead are wonderful performers! I have loved their performances ever since I first saw them sing on television in 2004. Their Christmas album is very good. My favorites are ""O Holy Night"", ""Silent Night""(I've always been VERY impressed by Meav's vocal range), ""Christmas Pipes""(this one is my VERY favorite), ""Carol Of The Bells"", ""O Come All Ye Faithful"", and ""Let It Snow!"".The other songs are also great, although the chorus overpowers the women in ""Ding Dong Merrily On High"", and ""Don Oiche Ud I Mbeithil"" needs a translation. Orla does a wonderful job with ""Away In A Manger"", although I like the other version of that song better. They do a good job with ""The Little Drummer Boy"", although I prefer it to be sung slowly and simply. All in all, this is a wonderful album, and anyone who likes Celtic Woman should buy this."
5,Beautiful music for anytime of year.,"I could listen to this album year round. The voices are sooooo smooooooothe. I loved every cut, but the favorite of all is O Come All Ye Faithful! Then comes Have Yourself a very Merry Christmas. what a fun tune with beautiful voices. This album will send any person into overdrive singing along with it. Just the best at holiday time."
5,Celtic Woman-What more is there to say?,"If you have heard Celtic Woman on PBS and love those performances, you will love this CD. It has become part of our Christmas playlist."
5,Holiday Classic,I heard their songs on the radio and had to buy this CD. I love it!! It instantly gets you in the holiday spirit. They have amazing voices - they sound like angels! BUY THIS CD!!!
5,this rocks,this cd is awesome..great combination of types of music..comes with a dvd as well that is nice to watch..I love it and my kids like some of the songs to and ask for it often.
5,Gigi Soundtrack Review,"If you like My Fair Lady you probably will like Gigi. The songs have the same magic as the songs from My Fair Lady. Both of these shows are written by the same authors. Some recommended tracks are ""Thank Heaven For Little Girls"", ""The Night They Invented Champagne"" and ""Say A Prayer For Me Tonight"". But I think everybody's favorite is the title tune ""Gigi""."
2,Love Chan - Hate This Set,"I have the first five collections of Charlie Chan movies and thought this might be a nice addition. I was wrong. Of the 4 movies, only two are halfway decent. The first, Dark Alibi, is embarrassing in its use of black actor Martin Moreland aka Birmingham Brown. The worst combination of stereotyping and bad schtick are visited on Moreland who plays off Benson Fong as ""number 3 son."" Fong is dreadful in this role and Chan seems angry or bored or both. The other three movies are fair but the plots are weak and the sidebar shenanigans of Moreland and Victor Sen Young (back, thank goodness, as Chan's number 2 son) detract from what storyline there is. Save your money for something better than this set! A real disappointment."
4,CC TTM,This is Great......about Time...what about Tolers last 2 - Shadows over Chinatown and The Red Dragon.....they are the only ones left not on DVD
3,Only Four Films,"All the reviewers are gushing about this set and as a Chan fan I can somewhat agree. I find this small 4 movie issue an extreme disappointment. Many years back Warner Bros issued the first six Chan Monograms. When I read the news release I assumed the rest of the Monogram Chans were being released. I was shocked when I found out it was only four films. In this day and age when complete TV series are being issued in a set, why only four films. Also disappointing is Warner Bros. skipping over two Sidney Toler entries. Messing up the chronological order of the films that have been released. I suppose in another ten years Warner Bros. will issue another set. But honestly, Chan fans have waited long enough. Fox has issued their Chan sets in fairly fast sequence. Come on Warner Bros., get on the ball."
3,Older Charlie,"Later Charlie Chan series, it is fun to see, although not the best in the series..I am however all about completing colections.."
2,TCM Charlie Chan Collection DVD's,"I wasn't to thrilled with this four dvd set. The three movies with Sidney Tolar, were done just prior to his death. They seemed to be done like the old old westerns, when the whole movie was shot in one day. Unless anyone really likes the Charlie Chan mysteries, I wouldn't reccommend this product. Not worth the money."
5,Charlie Chan movies are good,"Although these weren't Sidney Tolar's best movies, it is good to have almost his full collection on DVD and to be able to watch his final picture."
4,fun entertainment,As a child I really enjoyed the Charlie Chan movies and re-watching them is great fun...trying to identify all the old character actors..looking up the bios...most of these were made about the time I was born.
3,collection filler,"Although not the best ""Chan"" ever filmed, its still good collection filler for addicts like myself. The quality of the product is good."
5,Powerful sound that enters inside you...,"This is a truly amazing electronic work. This is sound at its purist level. This CD will sound different in every acoustical environment it is played into.In Greensboro, my bedroom had a sloped ceiling. I put this album on and went to bed--turning off the lights. The sound of this CD would whirl around the room, enter my left ear, linger inside my brain, then exit through my right ear, and vascillate back again. OK, you think perhaps I was ""high"", and I was. But just on Lucier's pure sonic creation. Try it!"
3,Okay,Concepts are presented fine. Some of the examples seem too advanced. Worth it if cost was less or if purchased used.
3,Wait a minute...,"I ordered this book thinking that it's many illustrations would make things ""simple."" But let me tell you, if you do not consider yourself an avid sewer and very familiar with your sewing machine, don't even consider getting this book. It will drive you insane. It's definitely written for people who have a very good understanding beyond ""just the basics.""One reason this book is difficult to follow is that it focuses on VERY tailored covers. Not the kind you find at SureFit or the local linen store. The designs require measurements of your furniture piece from every conceivable angle.If you love measuring and working out mathmatical formulations for hours...get this book. If not, look somewhere else."
1,This album stinks!,"After reading the reviews from Amazon, I purchased this album (it took nearly a month to receive it). There is just too much electronic music(should I say electronic noises disguised as music?), often times covering up Kayah's voice. What a letdown."
5,Langensheidt is the best,"I always get their pocket dictionaries. For one thing, they have plastic covers which serve well when it rains. Which it always does :-)"
1,"Narrow appeal, title does not identify subject",A most unsatisfying book. The title and description do not identify the subject matter.
5,Cool Drive,One of the best CD-RW drives. with the speed of 32x it will let you burn for less then 4 min. and the audio rip of 40x makes the audio without the pops and clicks.If you need a drive buy the best one from TDK.
2,"can you say ""knock off""?",I bought this book thinking that it was a reprint of Edith Head's The Dress Doctor. Once I actually looked it I realized that this thing is just a colllection of excerpts from her book. I returned it and will search for a used copy of the real Dress Doctor book.
1,No content; not worth purchasing,"This book has a great title, but no content. There are a few sentences per page, and the suggestions are very dated (i.e. as in, what to wear to the bowling alley). Don't waste time on this book. Very shallow and you can go through it in 30 minutes."
2,Abridged and so somewhat pointless,"Abridging the contents of this book makes the information completely outdated. The contents of what was a definitive book of style and grace of a generation is pared down to a collection of one liners. The illustarations are gorgeous, although at times ill fitted."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Adaptation of the movie. A setting that is not pretty and more incommon with Jabberwocky, giving a much more realistic depiction of thesqualor of the times."
1,Frustrating,"Terribly designed product.My problems began with the lid. It comes unassembled with no instructions (which shouldn't be a problem, normally). Upon attempting to assemble the lid as pictured, I found the screw isn't long enough to reach from under the lid into the handle. Tayama obviously has no sense of quality control.The pot itself is riddled with problems. The sides and the bottom of the pot are the same thickness, which causes the entire pot to heat when placed on a stove. It makes a horrendous noise while heating. Even when used on an electric stovetop, scorch marks are left on the inside of the pot."
4,Good,"We looked for a long time for a split hot pot and finally found one. Works very well. I like spicey foods where as my wife doesnt, so this works great. She can divide our food spices so we get the taste we both enjoy."
3,"Great function, not so great reliablilty",I loved this shower head when we got it about 14 months ago. The air jet gives the feeling of a much higher water usage shower head. Very nice. But now the shower head leaks a great deal when it is in the spray position (but not the massage position). I'm going to have to replace it soon. I was expecting for this price something that lasted a bit longer than this.
5,Wonderful CD!,"Of all the CDs that I've gotten for my baby, this is our family's favorite. It's very soothing and comforting with a wonderful, creative mix of different sounds that put my baby right to sleep. The sound of the river running is my favorite, and I've used it to fall asleep myself. I truly recommend this CD."
5,Use it every night,"I am very satisfied with this CD purchase. We pretty much play this every night. Our daughter is in a bassinet in our room so WE also have to listen to it all night long.... but hey, It puts US to sleep, too!! I recommned this CD."
5,Wonderful,"This CD is awesome. We put my 3-month old to bed every night with this CD. Even if he doesn't fall asleep right away, it gets him moving in the right direction. Well worth it."
4,Good way to get baby to sleep.,"There are a few sounds that scared my baby to begin with, so I just started skipping those sounds. All around though, it is a great way to get baby off to dreamland."
1,There is the sound of a baby screaming in the background,"It was suggested that I turn up the volume very high to calm a very fussy baby, but in so doing I noticed the faint sound of a baby crying in the background of the cd. I noticed it on my baby's two favorite tracks, track 1 and track 9 (must be at very high volumes - listen close for it). Has anyone else noticed this? Both my wife and I were immediately appalled and that was the last time we will use this cd."
3,Nice CD,"I wouldn't say this CD put my 2 and 1/2 month old into a ""trance"" but it is a wonderful addition to her bedtime routine and it makes her room a little less lonely for her at night."
5,very cool,What a great idea. It really works and I still can't believe my son likes sleeping to the sound of freeway traffic... who new!?
2,Not such a fan,"I bought this moisturizer at ULTA, which was recommended by staff. I returned it after a few weeks of use. I found it to be very greasy and it took a long time to absorb. I finally decided to return it after swimming a few times with my kids. The moisturizer would run into my eyes and it really burns. That was it for me.I instead bought Neutrogena Visibly Even. I really am happy w/this product. Half of the price, absorbs quickly, non greasy and smells great."
2,Mario Bedascu Oil free Moisturizer,"Hi there,I havent returned it but I am very disappointed with this product, it says oil free but it seems to be very thick and greasy and has caused me to break out worse. I am taking the time now to send a review."
2,I am returning mine,"I bought this headset along with my new Palm Treo 650 phone. Since the phone had bluetooth, I thought it would be nice to have a wireless headset for convenience and safety (in car).The first night I used it at home I loved it. Nice sound, easy to use. My only complaint was that the device was not more adjustable; it was not as comfortable as other wired headsets I have used.The next day I used it while in the car and found I hated the thing. I ended up pluggin in my old wired headset. First of all, I could not get the volume up high enough to hear the callers over the car's wind noise. I also could not get the speaker closer to my ear (lack of adjustments). However, the straw that broke the camel's back was that half the calls I made / received did not connect from the phone to the headset.Nice idea. Not ready for prime-time."
5,1950's Revival,I've recently discovered old movies from the 50's staring Gene Wilder. He was a great actor from his time and deserves much recognition for his work.
5,Great quality product,This is a great product for the price. Shake mix taste just fine and mixes well in my blender. Will buy again.
5,Great workout drink,"I mainly use this for hard workouts and when I snowboard or something else similar that I don't do often and get sore muscles from. This makes recovery so much quicker. The flavor is pretty good, I have had both cookies and cream and vanilla ice cream. I prefer the vanilla ice cream but thats just my opinion. Compared with other protein shakes such as Muscle Tech (my brother uses) it has less calories and we both agree BSN tastes better. MuscleTech seems to have more ""different"" ingredients but a lot of them are just made up words that they patented for blends of normal proteins and enzymes that are included in other shakes. I have only tried 4 different protein shakes and by far this is my favorite."
2,Unfortunately the container was cracked & I won't get to taste it. :(,"upon recieving this, the lid was cracked & powder was spilling out into the box. I will be throwing this in the garbage & out the $23 I spent on the powder. Kinda bummed. I will still order more in hopes that it won't be damaged."
5,Delicious Protein Powder,"Delicious, nourishing, protein powder supplement. Makes up for not having ice cream, and I love ice cream! Keeps me satisfied and is quite tasty."
4,Very good tasting protein powder,"This caramel latte protein powder tastes fabulous in coffee!!! The only minor complaint I have is if you don't shake it or stir it ALOT, you might have some clumping. Otherwise....best protein I've tried. 22g per serving is great!"
5,Tastes Awesome!,"This product tastes great. No chalky aftertaste.good frozen as well. I would definiely recommend this to meet your protein requirements. I start out every day with A shake, and this is my favorite."
4,"good product overall, although one con.","Please now this is for the chocolate peanut butter flavor. Other flavors I have tired are five stars.I bought this flavor because it was cheaper than the other flavors, but this one sadly has a fatal flaw in how it doesn't blend as easy leaving little chunks of protein that taste like sand. I've tried with water and milk using one of those GNC whisk cups. Which never had a problem before. Hopefully doesn't effect protein absorption"
4,Super Tasty!,"This stuff tastes fantastic! From the research I did, I believe it to be very high quality, and the ingredients list has all the right stuff on it. I do wish, though, that it didn't have so many carbs. There are almost as many grams of carbs as there are of protein. That is okay after a workout, but this powder isn't really a workout protein since there is a lot more than whey in it. So I use it somewhat sparingly, but it is right up there with Muscle Milk for flavor."
5,Best Tasting Protein EVER! Good Nutrional quality TOO!,"The deal on amazon for this Protein was awesome. It is actually one of the best tasting proteins ive had in recent times. It mixes well and the nutritional content is decent. You dont have to rely on one shake for all of your daily needs, but this makes it enjoyable to consume. I also got the blender bottle with it, which i highly recommend. You can go to GNC and get all of this stuff for TWICE THE PRICE! Amazon rules! Snytha 6 RULES.Five stars all the way."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Highly rated and highly effective. The combination of good stuff in here keeps me at the top of my game, and for the price I got it for cannot be beat. I personally feel like it improves overall energy during the day also, so make for a good morning shake to start the day."
5,Tastes Great!,"Tastes great! It works, I've noticed muscle mass with a proper workout routine. No reason to purchase another product, thanks BSN."
3,"Does the job, but has a strange chemical taste","It's definitely loaded with Protein and all the other goodies, that's for sure.However, it has a strange chemical taste to it, it also tastes very sugary since it has artificial sweeteners in it.Don't buy it if you don't like the taste of sugary things."
2,Horrible taste,"I'm surprised by all the positive reviews - the main reason why I purchased the product in the first place.I ordered the Chocolate Mint Flavor. The taste is sour and rancid. I had tried Chocolate Mint flavor before by Muscle Milk and it was the best protein shake I ever had. This in comparison is awful.Whether or not the protein shake does it's job, however, is another question. And, of course, this review is based solely off the taste of the product.To drink the stuff, I usually pour the powder in a cup along with milk and a banana then blend it together. I've been drinking my protein powder like this for years and so it can't be the milk or the banana being sour - it's BSN."
2,Too sweet,"I decided to order the Carmel latte version of this, though it was way to sweet for me. I tried with just 20oz of water, and the flavor was awful to try and gulp down. I even tried with milk which made it twice as sweet. I however decided to make my drinks using about 2 shots of espresso and a splash of milk which dulled down the sweetness, but it's still not my favorite. My boyfriend purchased the chocolate mint which is about 5x better tasting than the carmel latte. I do not recommend this to anyone, it does not come near to what a true Carmel latte even tastes like. Good product otherwise, it's a bit high in carbs & fats, but it's probably one of the better tasting protein shakes out there."
4,Nice Product,"Strawberry taste good only 22g of protien per serving and only 30 servings in the jar. Can't beat the price though, switched back to EAS myoplex."
4,Rich and Creamy,"This protein shake I take with 1 and a half scoops with 8 ounces of water to get my full 30 grams of protein I need everyday. The taste is rich and creamy, I found that after you mix it if you leave it for a minute or two it is much more creamy. This shake fills me up and I love it!"
4,Good taste and performance,I like the Chocolate milkshake flavor. It mixes well with water or milk. I've had great results from using this product and it is more affordable than most of the high end protein powders.
5,"The best tasting protein powder, ever","Syntha-6 makes the best tasting protein shake I have ever had! All other protein powders just pale in comparison. True, it has more calories per scoop than it's competitors, but that works for me as I often use it as a meal replacement. Plus, there are some benefits that come with the extra calories, like the high fiber content. I've only had the Chocolate Milkshake flavor so far, but I can't wait to try all the others! I love blending a scoop with big splash of vanilla soy or almond milk and a cup of ice and eating it like ice cream. My husband likes to add a banana to his. Great stuff!"
4,Great taste,"Great taste, even in just water. I do have a hard time mixing it well. Tends to clump up and not dissolve sometimes, but I chug it down any way."
5,!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!,"This stuff kicks A$$. I used several protein powders before this one and this one is by far the best. It refreshes me after a workout, reduces muscle soreness greatly, and tastes delicious. I have had the Vanilla, Strawberry, and chocolate and they are all extremely tasty just with water (no clumps of goo either!!!!). I have made shakes with them a couple times and that is like heaven. Anyhoo, best protein powder ever. It also has Isolates so if your tummy gets upset easily (like mine) this one cures that problem. Simply put, a great product for a great price. RAAAAWR, bye this stuff and go hit the GYM!!!!! Seriously though, bye this stuff it's great!"
5,"Price is good, tastes good","I've already tried many BSN Syntha-6 Products, and they are one of the better tasting protein shakes out there. Amazon just happens to sell these for much cheaper than most stores. I still think the best deal you can get is the protein from Optimum Nutrition which also has a good taste. I like to alternate between the two.Results wise, as long as you eat healthy, use this to SUPPLEMENT your lifestyle, and exercise you should see good results."
2,I keep canceling this subscription and it keeps coming!,The protein isnt anything special and now the price doubled! STOP sending me this garbage amazon! why do I have to write more words argghhh!
3,Not as great as I thought it would be.,"I bought the Chocolate Milkshake version of this mix a few days ago. I also had some Pure Protein brand Cookies n' Cream flavor to compare it to.Syntha-6 has 3 grams less protein than Pure Protein. It also did not come with a ""scoop"", like Pure Protein did, so without the Pure Protein scoop I would have had no idea how much to use. Also, the flavor was bland (I mix it with skim milk), and didn't have the yummy taste of chocolate like the Pure Protein brand had the yummy taste of cookies n' cream. Also, Syntha-6 is $8 more per bottle.I am female and these are the only two brands I have sampled so far. I will not be buying this brand again; I suggest Pure Protein. It can also be found in-stores, whereas I couldn't find Syntha-6 anywhere besides online."
3,"Mix, Drink, Workout, Get Jacked, then crap your brains out!","I don't have much experience with protein shakes, but I've lived enough to know that if you drink or eat something and within the hour your stomach gets incredibly gassy and you need to poop your intestine out, whatever you had isn't the best quality.You know that feeling after you come back from a grimey Chinese buffet joint? Yeah, THAT feeling! So basically, when drinking this mix, make sure a bathroom is accessible because your workout experience will be greatly disappointing when you're constantly worried that you'd crap your pants in front of everyone."
5,mhm,"This is the best protein on market ,quality\price and tastes awesome if you mix it with low fat milk and mixed with MuscleMilk you get better results.PEACEEEEE"
5,Best tasting protein on the market!!! I FREAKIN LOVE IT!!,"I switched from so many different protein because they all tasted bad. I came across this one and fell in love. I got the vanilla one and it TASTES LIKE ICE CREAM! OMG MAN, i just wanna drink this all day! as for effectiveness, i have no idea because ive only had it for two days but this is the best taste-wise! IT ALSO MIXES SO EASILY AND IT DOES NOT LEAVE CLUMPS like other protein. OMG PPL NEED TO BUY THIS NOW! i am a 16 year old athlete who doesn;t know that much about protein, but when it comes to the taste, this is the one!!!!"
4,"Good, chocolate tastes better","Same as other syntha6 protiens, they seem to help ME better than standard 100% whey.Chocolate had more flavor and seemed to get thicker, which I liked."
2,Too high calorie,"Not a bad protein, but too high calorie. I believe the second or third ingredient is sunflower oil. I noticed that after two weeks of taking this several times a day I put on some unwanted fat. Not a good sign and unusual considering I have a very healthy diet and am a competitive athlete. I replaced this w/ ON's protein instead which provides 24g of protein with only 120 calories. ON (has like 1000+ positive reviews) was much healthier and not as thick and helped me maintain my fitness goals."
3,Does not mix with spoon tastes good,"I've experienced 4 or so whey proteins, this one probably mixes the worst out of all of them. It however does tastes good and gets the job done for protein...and it was cheap. I would recommended ON Whey over this stuff though. I give it 3 stars due to its poor mixing abilities, solid price, and good taste"
5,Great taste and BCAA's,Best tasting protein powder that you will fine. Tastes great even when you mix it with water. BCAA help to preserve the muscle from breaking down & they are in this protein powder. May find it in others but they probably wont taste as good as syntha-6. I will stick with this product for life.
4,Great taste!!,"This is one of the best tasting protein supplements I have ever tasted. With the shakes It makes, the powder dissolves well and the protein is quality."
2,super hard to digest,"I have GERD, but this product flares it up like crazy. I have used other proteins, namely, gold standard, and had no problem. This protein tastes delicious, but, makes me feel like crap all day after only one serving. If you have GERD, stay away."
5,Chocolate Mint,"If anybody here is curious, the chocolate mint flavor is quite tasty. I've had a number of the different flavors and they are all great. I love having one of these after working out."
5,Yum! Best tasting protein powder I've ever tried!,"Love this protein powder! The chocolate milkshake flavor is AMAZING, even when mixed with just water! So tasty--a great supplemental source of protein! Would definitely recommend using this with the Blender Bottle; a quick, easy, nutritious post-workout supplement!"
3,"BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder, Vanilla Ice Cream",Didn't like this flavor at all. Really has no flavor like vanilla ice cream. I had ordered the Caramel one and finished that in no time! This one I'm struggling through just to finish. Very disappointed. Highly recommend the other flavor Caramel Latte ....
2,Taste Great,"You'll never find a better tasting protein shake. BSN is known widely for their N.O. Xplode but they kind of dropped the ball on this one. Syntha-6, although with a cool name, has only 28 grams of protein but costs the same as the other name brands. I don't know about you but I'd rather go for a bottle of Isopure with nearly twice the protein and zero carbs."
3,Too early to say,"It's too early for me to see results of Syntha. It's very tasty, recovery it not bad but I haven't seen great results. I'll wait till finishing up the whole tub."
1,very poor taste,"Don't buy this strawberry shake! I order a three pack and this strawberry was one of them. I hate it, I understand that it is fairly inexpensive but come on! This is gross! It tastes like pure chemical and I almost threw up trying to drink it with milk. I am either throwing it away or if they would exchange it for another, I will do that! Do not get strawberry! Stick to chocolate cookies and cream!"
1,"Jar was only 3/4 full, and no scoop","I wish I could rate this product higher, but never had a chance to try since no scoop was included. Directions tell you to use a ""scoop"" of powder with 4 to 5 oz of liquid. Last time I checked the term scoop wasn't a standard measurement, and I don't think anything has changed. Additionally... the jar came packed with powder only 3/4 full. I'm not sure if that normal, but hopefully the seller can contact me to clarify. Will probably return."
1,Torn off seal!,"I opened the bottle to see the paper/plastic safety seal under the cap had been ripped off, with bits of paper still along the top of the jar! No scoop either. Was this product tampered with? Seller, please contact me."
5,Very good,"Like another reviewer wrote, I always usually have these blended with small amount of ice cubes and a 1/2 banana. I often throw in about 10 coffee beans too. Chocolate Peanut Butter is very good, both wife and I like it a lot. Only other we've tried so far is the Mochaccino, which is good but not a ton of flavor like the CPB has. Still good though, and neither has any kind of weird aftertaste that we can notice."
5,BSN Syntha-6,"I've tried many different protein shakes from different companies, but I always come back to Syntha-6 because of the taste. The strawberry flavor is my favorite and considers it the best. It taste so good, like a dessert."
4,"Tasted great, but caused congestion?","I was amazed at how good it tasted and how well it blends. It says to blend 1-2 scoops (the scoop is big, probably a quarter cup at least) into 4-8 oz of water, but I always used at least 12 oz. Even still it tasted great and dissolved entirely. I also tried blending into milk and while it dissolved, I would almost say it tasted better with water.As for the effectiveness, I can't really say if it boosted my muscle growth, but I did think I felt better during my workouts if I drank some beforehand. It is also very filling and made a good breakfast substitute.My only complaint is that I thought it made the back of my mouth sore and caused some major congestion. This happened after drinking it ~2 times a day for about a week. I don't know if this was actually the cause, but the ""sickness"" seemed different than the average cold, and my mucus had a strangely yellow tint, so I thought I might have had an allergic reaction of some sort."
4,Not Crazy about Mochaccino!,"Just got this 5 minutes ago and used one scoop. Don't like the flavor. Think I will do Vanilla or Strawberry next time. I have no idea what the outcome will be, but I will update. If it works, I will buy another flavor next time. Had Body Fortress Strawberry and that was awful until I drank it for a week, and now I love it. The Syntha-6 Mochaccino now is awful. Well, it is only 2+lbs (almost 3) so it should go fast. Actually pretty big for 2+ lbs. I have only noticed little wait gain with Body fortress taken 3 times a day, so I hope this will only take one shake a day, because that is all I can do in this flavor. The product itself has GREAT Ratings, so I will update when I get some proof that it works. The good thing about this is it has egg, milk and soy so it should be way better than Body Fortress. We will see."
4,sweet,"its very high grade protein and i trust it a lot, and the taste with syntha 6 is unmatched. however, cookies and cream flavor tends to be a bit too sweet, loaded with artificial sugar, and its somewhat too much to handle. mixed with milk is almost unbearable since it tastes like youre eating a milkshake, but with water its less sugary and easier to drink. I wouldn't recommend this product if you do not like sweet things. I usually have 2 scoops (as recommended) after my workout, and its pretty good if you mxi it with water. Syntha 6 has excellent flavors that taste exactly like the said flavor, but i would like it if it was less sweet. i probably wont order this flavor anymore. mochaccino was very very good."
2,Taste on choco peanut butter is pretty rough,"I bought this because of all the positive reviews, trying to upgrade the protein/serving of the Muscle Milk that I was drinking. Unfortunately, I have to force myself to drink this - the aftertaste of the peanut butter is really rough, and the smell makes me nauseated. I understand this is subjective, so take that with a grain of salt.Due to lack of expertise, I can't comment on its nutritional value. But having to force-feed myself takes 3 stars off the rating."
4,"The Best, BSN will always hold the title.",This is a great tasting product. It does taste like cookies and cream. You wont have to choke it down too.
5,Very good,"I have used it for around 6 months. Tasts great, relatively easy to mix (through blender is recommended) results are there as far as effectiveness goes. Definitely better than cheap protein mixes. Could be cheaper, could be easier to mix and could taste just a tad better."
3,1st protein powder,"I am a finicky eater and I don't like powdered stuff. No powdered milk or healthy type stuff. So I was not sure but figured at the price, which I couldn't find this any lower anywhere else, that I would give it a try.I found it pretty good, (vanilla) which is one of my favorite flavors. It took a few days to get used to it. I found that by adding 1/2 teaspoon of Slimfast Chocolate Royale it tasted like a vanila/chocolate milkshake and now it is tempting to drink it through the day instead of just for the morning."
4,Best tasting whey I've tried yet,"The Syntha-6 vanilla ice cream flavor is the best tasting whey I've tried so far. However, it doesn't come without a price, since the amount of carbs in this are a lot higher than in something like Optimum Nutrition brand whey. Either way, I'll continue with this powder until it's time to cut weight, in which case I want to pare down on carbs wherever possible."
5,Consistently great,Low cost and provides the perfect amount of protein for most needs. The flavor mixes with anything and it does what it says.
5,A protein I look forward to drink every day,Pros:- Whey protein for immediate release- Casein Protein for long term release- Good amount of calories- AMAZING TASTECons:- Expensive
4,Great stuff,I had bought this after trying a friends one time. It is really great stuff and gives u enough protine that even if u just take it as a post workout shake I feel that it really helps to feed your muscles. I used to use muscle milk but this stuffJust blows it out of the water. The only complaint I have about it is that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth after a while if you don't eat anything else with it.
4,Great price and tastes good too.,"I ordered one of these last month and I liked it so well that I ordered two more this month. The seller is very fast at shipping and they offer fair prices. The product tastes good too, I definitely recommend it."
3,"Good powder, but doesn't always end well.","Hey People,I'm a freshman in high school and I bought this powder around 2 months ago. It's great powder, built some good muscle in a week or two, but I had read some strange reports on the sweeteners in the Syntha-6. Instead of Sucrose, it was labeled Sucralose. Its not the biggest deal, but I had a pretty big meal one night, got a workout, drank 18 ounces of the shake, and woke up at 12:30 in the morning, only to vomit all over my room. Granted, I hadn't had the healthiest meal either. But it's something to consider. Cheers,DieselD"
5,Wonderful Banana taste and product has helped with toning and weight loss.,"I've used Syntha 6 for over a year. Banana is very good. Strawberry is good also. Chocolate is good but a little thicker (I use milk and a litte bit of water for all my mixes). I can mix with a spoon if I don't have my special shaker cup, just have to mix the spoon around for a good 1 or 2. I can drink for breakfast and huge cup of tea and be good until lunch. By far the best tasting protein shake. I don't have to add any other fruit, sugur, etc."
2,Causes severe gas and bloating. However it tastes great.,"I workout frequently and Im in good shape. Im a 29yr old male. I had high hopes but wont ever use again. I couldnt wait until this stuff was gone. It caused the worst gas! I am not sensitive to protein but this stuff killed my guts. I was always bloated and the gas was insane! Maybe it was the Egg ingredient that caused the gas, Im not sure but it was rough. Id rather use ON, EAS or Dymatize(although the flavors arent great)."
4,Watch out for the Cholesterol Levels!,"In my opinion, the chocolate milkshake tastes better than the vanilla. Doesn't have a bad aftertaste of fake sugar.The cholesterol per serving (per scoop) is 55mg, which is 18% of the daily value, so be careful.Just as good as the GNC Pro Performance' AMP Amplified Wheybolic Extreme 60."
4,"Wow, this stuff is really tasty!","I've tried a variety of protein powders in the last few years, and none of them taste as good as this mix (except pre-mixed Muscle Milk, but that costs quite a bit more). The chocolate flavor is really, really good. When mixed with milk it tastes just like chocolate milk! My only complaint is that the protein content isn't as high as some alternatives, but I'll make that sacrifice since it tastes so good."
5,Great product,This stuff is great!!! I have tried all kinds of protein powders before but this product is in a league of its own.Not only does it taste great but it helps to keep my weight in check. Great fuel for the body!!!
5,Awesome!,BSN hit gold on this. I had my wife try it out and she loves the taste and has taken up drinking protein when she gets the chance. I've only been taking this for about a month now (once per day) but with my workout schedule I am seeing definite results (leaner). will definitely be buying this product once I run out.
5,Best powder on the market,"It increased healing time and I noticed huge gains just after 2 weeks of using this stuff! In combination with PowerFULL and Jack3d, Syntha-6 is getting me to where I want to be."
5,Love Syntha - 6,I've used this product for some time. I love it. It helps after workouts and gives me a good source of energy between regular meals.
5,Great for post-workout shakes,"I normally buy the generic brand from Vitamin World, and enjoy the taste, but when this came up for a discounted price, making it the same price as the Vitamin World brand, I jumped on it. Although it tasted a little different to my old brand, I came to like it quite a lot.I mix it with orange gatorade powder for post-workout shakes and like it a lot. Be sure to do the subscription on it as you'll run out real quickly and it's annoying to not have one in stock when you need it."
2,A Bad Value.,"At first glance this protein seems great. It gives 22 grams of protein per serving and appears to be quite cheap given that with subscribe and save you can buy five pounds for roughly $34. Unfortunately, other products routinely provide 25 grams/per serving and they do it in a total gram serving of 30-33. These other products are providing you with a product that is roughly 80% protein. A serving of Syntha-6 is a bloated 44 grams and only half of that (50%) is protein. That also means that per pound you only get 10 servings versus 15 servings from a regular 30-gram serving. This breaks down to $7.14/pound and 3.17 cents per gram of protein, which is really high. A mix of protein from a custom mix site is about 3.3 cents per gram including shipping. Some people might want to use this as a meal-replacement protein but it is always much cheaper and better to just add simple foods to your protein shake to get those extra calories. I would recommend buying something higher quality."
2,Quarter Empty,"I decided to get a different flavor of the Syntha-6, and I was extremely disappointed to see that over a quarter of the container was empty. The last time I bought it it was filled almost to the top. I'm not happy with this purchase."
3,Not good for Cholesterol!,"After reading all the great reviews I decided to try Syntha-6 (Vanilla) instead of my usual Muscle Milk. The taste is pretty good, but I was disappointed to find that just one serving (22g Protein from one rounded scoop) contains 23% of the RDA for Cholesterol (RDA is for people WITHOUT a Cholesterol problem).Conversely, an equivalent of 1.5 scoops of Muscle Milk (24g Protein) contains only 7% of the RDA for Cholesterol. Personally I also prefer the taste of Muscle Milk, and it's got a lot more vitamins and minerals than Syntha (don't take my word - compare the labels!).Syntha is a good product if you don't have Cholesterol concerns, and if BSN comes out with a lower Cholesterol version, then I would give them another try."
1,Severe stomach cramping,"Didn't taste bad but about 12 hours after using it I had severe stomach cramping/bloating. Very painful and caused me to get sick. The next day I didn't make it to work and I was queasy all day. I read the bottle again that day and in fine print read that it could cause ""severe stomach cramping"". After doing some research I found that is common with the types of proteins in the product. I guess I needed to actually heed the small print."
4,Amazing taste,"The nutritional profile isn't the best you can find (less protein per gram than many other powders), but the taste is bar none. The vanilla ice cream *almost* rivals the taste of a restaurant milkshake. Mixability is good, especially in a blender bottle. I also use it to make a protein ""cake,"" mixing a half scoop with a little baking soda and stevia, and adding water to make it like a batter. Nuke it for 30 seconds or so and top with PB, jam, whatever you like."
3,Not bad,"I make protein shakes for breakfast with a bunch of stuff and try to stay healthy. This has artifical sweetners, which takes away from any health benefit. Why not use stevia instead? The taste was decent and it kept me fuller than Optimum Nutrition Natural Whey, but the added artificial sweetner has me looking at other powders."
5,DELICIOUS,MMMMMM the taste is mind blowing...i feel hyped up whenever i drink this...its got like a steroid effect in it without actually having it...VERY NICE!
1,Corn Syrup????,"I was about to buy this until I researched the ingredients and learned that this is sweetened with cheap corn syrup,among other things. I found this is Linberg's Nutrition Express Catalog. I avoid corn syrup and am disappointed in the company for going with cheap instead of healthy."
3,nutrition facts,"Hi guys, I just bought bsn syntha 6 and bsn true mass, its kind of very sweet so i could only take it few times a day..I know its kind of silly but I just wanna make sure that I understand it coz I wanna make sure that Im getting much calories as I could. Now, in 1 scoop of syntha 6 theres 200 calories on it, right????"
1,Consumer Reports found dangerous Metals in this and many other Shake products!!!!!,"Consumer Reports found dangerous Metals in this and many other Shake products!!!!!Dangerous levels of Cadmium, lead and many others for people who drink 3 or more shakes a day.... well I don't want ANY metals I don't need in something I'm taking to help my HEALTH!!!"
5,Tastes soo good..,"I work out consistently, but I'm not someone who's really interested in all of the facts pertaining to the ingredients of protein powders. I find all the terminology exhausting. What I do know is that this stuff tastes great, and from my limited knowledge, it seems to have worthwhile ingredients. I also noticed it blends very quickly, even with a shaker cup. I have been using Syntha-6 off and on for probably almost a year now, and I've never been dissatisfied. Give it a shot."
4,Syntha 6,"I started using this about a month ago and so far its working great! Great muscle mass increase, love the way that it doesnt leave my stomach all full, good source of energy, noticible difference between days you take it and those you dont. The taste is great, pretty much everything about it is besides the high calories and suger. But I would definatly recomend it to anyone who is willing to be consistent with exercise and proper use."
5,awesome taste and great results,it has a great taste and it has helped me with muscle recovery. I highly recommend this product for the intermediate workout enthusiast
2,Not what I expected,"I was very disappointed when this item arrived and I looked at the label.High fat, high carbohydrate, high cholesterol, added sugar. If you are looking for something to bulk up your love handles, this seems to be it.Plus, the label does not list the amino acid analysis, so you don't really know what you are getting.Isopure or Dymatize look like much better choices."
3,Great taste - Average Fat-Protein balance,"Compared to other products I have used this tasted pretty good, but I was a little disappointed with the Fat-Protein ratio. My own fault for not checking the BSN site in more detail. I wish amazon would have this on their site."
1,red bucket of s***,idk why people rate this product so high. maybe they work for bsn. first thier products were better years ago but since they sold thier company there quality has gone down hill. but since this review is about synta 6 ill stay on that. its not whey its a bunch of s*** protien thrown in a red bucket. i replaced my old whey protien with this one to try somthing new while i was cutting down for summer. this was the only thing i changed during my cutting cycle from years past and this time around i felt like s*** lost size took 6 weeks longer to get cut than years previus and spent alot more time on the toilet seat than anyone should . if people want taste go to mcdonalds and buy a milk shake on your way from the gym. please dont waste money on this red bucket of s***. try universal whey. dymatize iso 100. but not this.
1,Bland taste,I am really picky when it comes to taste of protein shakes. I didn't like this shake though I have never found a shake that I really enjoy yet. So I could be a harsh critic of it.
2,:(,I love the Syntha-6 and i realllllllly reallly really wish i had gotten cookies and cream or Vanilla. Strawberry taste so generic and makes me sick to the stomach.
4,tastes great less filling,"I used BSN Syntha-6 as a post workout and also as a meal replacement. Even though the flavor's amazing, I find that without the amino acids I don't feel full after a shake. So I found it effective as a post work out but not to helpful in between meals."
4,"Good Tasting, Good Gains","BSN makes a great product. I personally have used the chocolate flavor, and it was absolutely worth the purchase. They don't make you scoop it 4 times to get one serving either. Just one scoop! I gained 3 pounds lean mass after one tub. Would buy again!"
3,good snack replacement,"Good product for supplementing calories in between meals. Wouldnt recommend it for regular protein intake, you need a higher protein gram amount/per scoop. Overall not bad, considering the price for a well known name brand. Does tatse really good."
4,"Great Protein, not my favorite flavor","I love Syntha-6 Protein Powder, and usually get Chocolate Peanut Butter. I wanted to try Caramel Latte for some variety, and it is actually pretty good. But there is less you can mix it in to make a protein shake, so I usually just do the powder and water. It tastes fine like that, I just like something I can use with a little more variety!"
3,CHOCOLATE MINT review,I've tried several flavors from this brand. Chocolate mint DOES NOT taste like the Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies. It tastes like a chocolate protein shake and a hint of mint.The strawberry and the vanilla taste way better in my opinion. The chocolate is about as good.
4,Great middle of the road protein,"Great tasting stuff for ""middle of the road"" protein. There are many other powders out there with a couple more grams protein per scoop that have a little less calories, fat, carbs etc. but for the price and taste, this one is hard to beat. I mix the Vanilla ice cream flavor with some OJ and strawberries in the morning and it tastes AWESOME!"
4,Truly tastes like a chocolate milkshake.,"I lift weights and don't get enough protein from food, so I decided to try this as a protein supplement. In the past, I've tried chocolate protein powders and have had to force them down, due to the terrible taste. Fortunately, this version tastes great. While you probably won't confuse it with a milkshake from your neighborhood ice cream shop, it comes very close. It even tastes pretty good with water (though I typically use milk). You can add some peanut butter or cinnamon to give it an extra flavor. The 5 grams of fiber is a nice bonus too.The only negatives are the high calories (which isn't ideal for calorie counters), and the presence of sucralose (which results in a ""diet soda"" aftertaste).Overall though, I will continue to buy this due to the taste."
3,Its OK not the best tasting though...,Well I decided to give BSN syntha-6 a try based on the protein content being higher than most per scoop. Lets just say it gets the job done after a nice long workout. I usually use two scoops which will put you in the range of 44 grams!Only thing is the taste is bad and this is based off the chocolate milkshake flavor. Maybe I was spoiled coming from Muscle Milk but really it doesnt even come close to MM on flavor. Ill be switching back to Muscle Milk when this powder is done regardless if it has lower protein content per scoop. Sorry BSN :(
2,Didn't gain a pound !,"I consumed the whole thing in abut a month in the beginning of last summer to gain some weight, but nothing changed. I don't if there's something wrong with me or the products. it tastes pretty good though, especially with some H&H milk."
3,"Good, not great.","The taste isn't bad, but since this isn't a whey isolate the calorie count is a little high (if you're cutting) for the amount of protein per serving."
2,Mixed badly,"First of all, I want to say that I love Syntha 6, but for some reason this tube did not mix well unlike all of the others that I purchased at Vitamin Shoppe."
3,Brotein,"Okay trying this after using ON WHEY for a while...Just wanna comment on a few things.Calories is 200 per serving and there are 22g of protein per scoop.When you mix this stuff with milk you are going to probably seriously need 2 cups of milk or water to chug it. Its VERYYY thick in comparison to ON Whey.Drinking it with 2 cups of skim milk and it definitely fills you up but that's about 400 calories right there so if you are using it in a cut you are going to have to factor that in as 400 calories on a 1500-1800 calorie cut is quite a chunk of your daily allowance.Flavor is pretty good, Im using the peanut butter chocolate flavor and it's very sweet, best tasting whey by far but that comes with the extra calories so just watch out."
2,"High Carb, Sodium and Fat....",No returns! High Carb and high sodium and 25% fat!.... 15g of carbs and 220mg sodium ! You can do much better.
4,Good stuff,"well, it tastes great anyway. Lots of people call this ""high quality"" protein, but I have no idea what the scientific reasoning for that is. Only thing I know is that it tastes good, is priced reasonably and comes in a cool jar! DOES NOT mix well. You really have to work a bit extra to get it mixed well with milk or water or whatever works for you. For those that do not know, Syntha has different types of proteins for different uses. This one is part of what they call ""Foundation"" series. Check out the product in more detail and make sure you're buying what you need."
5,Tastes great!,"I bought BSN Syntha-6 and wasn't crazy about it the very first time I tried it, but since then I love it! At first I used a blender, then when I was in a hurry one day, I put some water in a water bottle, added the powder, shook it up well, and it was fine. I use more water than the directions call for, just to stretch it. I also tried Muscle Milk in chocolate. I only tried it once, but didn't like it as much - maybe because I was already used to the taste of this??"
3,"Delicious, but contains artificial flavors","Very tasty protein powder compared to a lot of the other brands I've tried. Very filling, you won't be hungry after you drink one of these.Contains artificial flavors, which are typically toxic chemicals made from God-knows-what."
5,Best Protein on the market,"Guys this is the best Protein on the market, thick and rich. And the price is the best on the web!!!"
5,"Best, bar none, protein supplement on the open market","Want a good, solid source of protein? This is it. Nuff said. It's affordable. It taste fantastic. It mixes well. It does it's job and then some. This replaces the hurt and damaged cells your muscles naturally breaks down after strenuous workout in no time. It rebuilds them, which is what's most important, while you sleep and the results are fast and long lasting. I've used them all. All kinds of worthless proteins on the market. Little more than cake mix 95% of them. As with any BSN product you can't go wrong with Syntha. I am 100% behind this company and have been since my 1st bottle of No-xplode. They make products worth your time and money. They get you results and that is all anyone can ask of.Buy this stuff if you're in the market for protein that WORKS!!!!"
2,Taste AMAZING with milk,"The product tastes great with low fat milk and with water..... Although for me its not the best as it does not digest well with me. Everybody's body is different so it may work for you. Also pretty high in calories 200 per scoop as opposed to ""warrior milk"" which is all natural protein powder and has 40 calories per scoop and tastes just as good with milk or almond milk."
4,Good Product with great results,I started using this product after my daily workouts and started noticing results after 3 weeks. I did have to increase my water intake as a result of taking the protein drinks but that wasn't an issues. I got the strawberry flavor and it is great. No chalky after taste. Tasts like a strawberry smoothie.I'll be trying the chocolate one next.
5,BSN Scientists are Wizards!,"You thought that protein shakes had to be nasty, clumpy and grainy? Foolish person... The Wizards at BSN have formulated a product that is not only effective and delicious, but isn't too expensive either! I've bought 2 5-pounders in addition to the 2.91 Cookies and Creme and have loved them all! Whether you want to lose weight or gain lean muscle mass (in conjunction with your workouts) then this is the protein powder for you. Now buy it!"
4,Tastes great. Would like something lighter.,"Compared to other meal replacement powders, this is pretty heavy on calories as well as other things that are not protein. I really like the taste. They did a great job with this.It is likely not that great for dieting. The problem for me is that protein powder seem to come and go so frequently (In terms of their availability in the market), it's hard to find something that is consistently available and serves my needs. This powder is been around for a long time and tastes really good."
4,"Great Tasting Protein, Solid Alternative to Muscle Milk","BSN Syntha-6 is one of the best protein powders on the market and deserves its positive reputation within the bodybuilding community. That being said, those who want maximum protein and minimal amounts of fat and carbohydrates will be disappointed by this protein powder's nutritional profile but that is not what this protein is meant for. It is a great post-workout recovery powder that taste very good when mixed with water, but reaches milkshake-like flavor when drinking with milk.I used this protein as a lower-caloric alternative to muscle milk and will likely purchase the product again in the future."
3,Great stuff,"I love the moccachino much better. The peanut butter has an artifical flavor taste, and it never is completely smooth after mixing."
5,Syntha 6 Protein Powder,Excellent product. Just buy whatever flavor happens to be on sale and you can generally get it for half the price that a place like GNC charges. Free shipping if you order a couple at a time.
4,"solid product, good price","I use this in conjunction with other proteins, but this one serves its purpose well. As an athlete trying to gain weight, the 200 calories in BSN helps me reach my caloric goal. Less protein per serving than in other brands, but for the price I paid for 54 servings, that can be forgiven. Because this is a blend, with some slow digesting proteins added, I drink this first thing before going to sleep and first thing upon waking up. Taste is wonderful, mixes as well as any other brand I've used. Its a bit thicker and frothier, which I like, as it helps me swallow my larger pills."
4,Mix with Milk for an almost Milkshake quality drink....,"I like to mix it with 1% milk and Ovaltine chocolate....Yum! Tastes awesome! Feel great afterwards. This is not the lowest calorie Protien powder by far, but I think it is one of the better tasting ones."
4,One of the best I've tried,This is a very drinkable and a very mixable protein powder. I've used 5+ containers of the product without any noticeable stomach trouble. I can also tell you that the formula has MCT oil which appears to be a solid ingredient. I wont elaborate on the MCT oil but I would encourage you to look it up.
5,AWESOME,Delicious. I've only been using it for a month so I don't know if I'm stronger yet so we'll see. At least it tastes good and keeps you full!
5,Great Stuff,"Syntha 6 is great, It is so fine that it does not clump. The result from your workouts will show very quickly."
5,Vanilla Ice Cream.. mmmm..,"This stuff is straight up delicious. The vanilla ice cream flavor is smooth and creamy (when mixed with 2% milk, at least) and definitely isn't a task to drink like some of the other protein powders out there. I'm really satisfied."
4,Helped with night hunger,"I have tried both the chocolate and the vanilla and believe the vanilla is much better. The chocolate is okay, but not as good as others. The powder mixes very well. I bought it as a recovery drink for after workouts because I would not be hungary for about an hour then starving at night and eating anything I could. This helped me control my hunger, feed my muscles, and get me back on track for weight loss and lean muscle building. I would like to see it with less calories and a bit more casein proteins. Overall, this is a great product."
5,Superb taste!,"I rarely write a review, but as someone who has had bypass surgery and needs to take extra protein every day, this one finally knocks it out of the park! It is the only one I have found that I can even being to stomach as something I look forward to drinking. I mix it with Very vanilla Silk soy milk and put in a few cubes of ice. I mix it in a blender and BAM! Tastes like a lovely vanilla milkshake. I even make up extra of it and keep it in the fridge to use in my coffee as a creamer. Fantastic!"
3,Super Thick,"I've tried many diff. powders, and while this one taste decent it is really thick. It also has pretty many calories. Most likely will not buy again."
2,"BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder, Cookies & Cream and Mochaccino Flavors","Having previously used, and enjoyed, the chocolate and vanilla flavors, I gave these a try. They were disappointingly inferior in taste to the others. On the Cookies & Cream, the 'cookie' particles tended to settle out and were really indistinguishable taste-wise. The Mochaccino flavor had a slight sharp after taste. I would not purchase these flavors again."
3,Tastes good but contains SUCRALOSE,"This protein shake tastes delicious but the only problem I have with it is it contains sucralose. The protein powder says it doesn't contain aspartame which is true however, sucralose is an artificial sweetener that is about 3 times sweeter than aspartame. ([...])I would suggest getting a protein powder without any artificial sweeteners."
3,flavor is okay,The strawberry was much better. This one is do-able luckily I only purchased the smaller tub. I will definitely be going back to strawberry.
4,Pretty good product,This flavor seems to mix better than the chocolate in both milk and water. Very smooth. Was a bit nervous about how this flavor would taste but I was pleasantly surprised. BSN Syntha-6 is a solid protein mix. I just wish it had a little less cholesterol.
5,"Flavor is a big deal, and this stuff delivers.","Basically, all modern high quality protein powders are the same, so for me, it all boils down to flavor. This stuff really delivers, it tastes great! I've tried so many different types, and by far this is my favorite."
4,Taste/blends great.,I was using on's whey protein until they stopped doing the subscribe and save. So I tried the chocolate milkshake flavor of this brand. It mixes really well with just a shaker bottle and has the consistency of a malt shake. The taste is great!
1,What the hell?,"Completely sent me the wrong flavor, asked for chocolate peanutbutter, and sent me Strawberry milkshake."
3,"Good protein, bad shake","The protein works well, but it does not mix well at all with milk or water. And the vanilla ice cream flavor tastes nothing like vanilla ice cream. It's not bad though."
2,Clumpy & could not taste the peanut butter,"I ordered this because of the good reviews & I wanted a protein powder to satisfy my peanut butter cravings. I found this one to be clumpy and I couldn't really taste the peanut butter flavor. I also think the calories, fat & carbs are kind of high.My favorite protein powder so far that I have found is Tempro, strawberry but it was discontinued."
3,vanilla variant contains soy,"been a loyalist of ON whey protein, and now im trying something new. it's my first week on this BSN syntha-6 and cant tell yet the difference with ON. comparing its nutrition label, BSN contains more fat, more cholesterol, more sodium and less protein/gram than ON. mixability - harder to mix but im okay on that as ive tried other whey brand that's as hard to mix. one icky thing tho, it contains SOY in form of casein and lecithin. soy as we know contains estrogen. i don't know what would it be for me in the long term, but for the short time im on BSN can't tell yet if it has bad effects for me. will update in the next coming weeks."
3,BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder (Strawberry),"This is a good tasting quality protein powder. The thing I wasn't anticipating, and this may be true of all such powders, was the high amount of calories and cholesterol. While I may find that such a product doesn't exist - when my supply of BSN Syntha-6 runs out I'm going to look for a lower calorie protein powder. I want to use the product to build muscle, not to gain weight."
3,the taste is just okay.,I drink boost. I like their mocha favor a lot. However they are very price so I decide to give this product a try. The taste is definitely not as good as boost. I guess I was expecting too much. I would say it taste just like any other protein powder.
2,no good but tastes good,"the problem with this protein is the main ingredient meaning most of it is whey protein, which means ur body only uses about 50% of the protein. also it has 60mg of cholesterol. another thing is the scoop size is huge meaning u dont get that many servings in such a huge jar 54 servings versus 81 servings in iso100. also if you're lactose intolerant ur screwed buying this. i would recommend iso100 which is way higher quality and has many more servings in a smaller container. the only thing syntha 6 has going for it taste"
4,Tastes great! Not low-cal,"This stuff tastes really good. Probably the best tasting protein powder I've ever had. That being said, I probably won't buy again due to the higher calorie content than I usually buy. If you're not focused on low calorie/carb/fat powder, definitely go for this stuff. Great value for the price."
5,Great taste,This by far is one of the best tasting protein powders on the market. It mixes easily and has a very creamy texture. I mix it with water usually and I still cant believe how good it tastes. Very low sugar too... I would recommend you try it the price is great too.
5,My Favorite Protein Mix,"Note I didn't say ""Whey"", Syntha 6 is as they state: ""6 Unique protein sources - A blend of fast, medium and slow digesting proteins"". In other words, a mix of casein and whey.This may be a bit of ""bro"" science, but here is why such a mix is great:* 1 scoop of whey, unless you're at least an amateur athlete or bodybuilder, you're probably going to ""waste"" most of the extra protein you're getting from this mix* Casein tastes like crap, but is great to take at nightSo for someone like me, having something that TASTES great and gives me the best of both worlds is perfect. The fast digesting protein will hit me right after a workout, while the slow digesting stuff will stick around for when I need it later.Did I mention it tastes great?"
5,High quality product,"This protein powder is great. I've only tried the 'Vanilla Ice Cream' flavor so far, but it tastes wonderful. Appears to be a pretty good bang-for-the-buck, and consists of high quality ingredients and minimal additives. Mixes extremely easy, too. Many protein powders I have used practically require a blender to eliminate dry chunks floating around in it. With Syntha-6, that's anything but the case. You can add a scoop of this to whatever you please in a regular water bottle, give it a quick shake, and it mixes completely. I'll definitely be purchasing more of this."
5,Perfect Taste ! Also... get a blender bottle!,"This stuff takes the gross taste out of proteins powder. I have never tasted anything better, and with a blender bottle its perfect."
5,Just started working out and am not looking back!,A co worker recommended this and I am so glad I took his advice. This stuff tastes really good. I have tried others that tasted like chalk! I use one scoop and about 8 OZ of ice cold water as I am just starting to work out. I feel the difference when I have it right after I am not as sore. Highly recommended!
3,The shake is ok,I finished the shake but the taste isn't all that great and mixing it with water or milk does make a difference. It is really sweet so water is best.
3,Its Ok,"It's certainly one of the best tasting products out there, but the scoop is large... about twice the size of what a normal protein scoops is. And so, it will finish in about half the time it will take you to do a different brand. My guess is that it has a lot of milk powder in it for taste (that's one of the main selling points - how good it tastes). Just my opinion."
4,Low Carbs - High Protein - Great Product,"Syntha-6 tastes amazing, has so few carbs it's silly, and really works well. There are less expensive alternatives out there, but I can't say anything but good things about the taste, the no-bloat feeling afterward, and the results."
5,BEST of te red ribbon sagas,I almost stayed up all night waching whis movie it is about a guy named genral blue who wants to get a dragon ball and so dose goku this is the most suspenceful saga in dragon ball and no fans should miss it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Great product but you can get it way cheaper,"This is a really good product, but this price should be for the 16 0z bottle."
4,Good simple introduction to microscopes for young kids,"This is a simple, gentle little story that gives a few simple ideas within its plot for getting started with a microscope at home. It will help your young child understand a little bit about what microscopes do and seed a few ideas on everyday common things you can look at and/or compare under a microscope.If you're looking for a bunch of experiments to try with kids and a microscope, look elsewhere.We enjoyed the story, but it is very simple. If available, I'd recommend getting this one from the library, and invest in more of a how-to book on experiments for microscopes for my own collection."
4,Fun with STEM,"Great companion book to a new science microscope. Helps inspire interest and ideas. Tells a story of what 'a kid like me' can discover through a microscope. (Easy to read vocabulary, too) With this book and a little bit of imagination...future mad scientists!!"
2,"Greg's Microscope is for boys, not girls","This is a nice easy reader about a child with a home microscope. Observation of common objects is presented with a good discovery approach, but Greg's family is depicted in a (very 1960s) sexist manner that diminishes its usefulness."
4,Good book for early readers,This book made my son pull out his microscope and look at everything he could find. It was amazing hto see how some items like salt look when magnified. A fun read.
3,Pleasant though incomplete rendition of the score,"This is Hollywood's reworking of the classic stage musical fantasy. The original LP was quite short with only nine cuts. This expanded CD version uses outtakes and dance music as well as scene underscorings to fill up the disk. It's a ""different"" BRIGADOON than the stage show. Emphasis here is on dance, not songs. Almost half the original score was discarded to make room for dance numbers. The film is charming and the story is hard to ruin despite the cuts. Buy this only if you either loved the film or love Gene Kelly's voice."
4,Gorgeous!!,"Actually the newly released CD is probably better than the actual film. They restored several songs that were cut from the final print of the film, and the soundtrack includes all of the dance music, which is spectacular, particularly the music for the Heather On The Hill dance sequence. Absolutely gorgeous. Overall the soundtrack is lovely!"
5,Brigadoon - love the DVD/ and the music,This is an old movie I never get tired of watching. Now I have the music I can play when I feel melancholy and want to remember good old days.One of my favorites. If you love Scotland and Romance this is for you.
2,In the Nightside...,"This series came highly recommended by several friends. But I have to say I was disappointed and couldn't get drawn into the story. The main charater's background is very relevant to the story, but we know nothing about him as the story opens and as the story moves on, we continue to learn very little about him ot the world known as The Nightside. And I found it very annoying that almost every other sentence ended with, ""in the Nightside"" as if the author expected the reader to forget where the story was taking place. I had very high hopes for this series, but was let down."
2,no useful tips,"Good games teach something so I wondered if knowing the ""Theory of Fun"" would help me teach. Could I convert some science data base into a game? Unfortunately I picked up no tips useful to me. The book describes fun, philosophizes about fun, has platitudes and personal opinions. Some reviews raised my expectations unrealistically."
5,A refreshing read,"This is is a nice read, well illustrated too, which shares some key points we game developers tend to forget about our own profession. Sometimes we just think of making cool games, forgetting our responsability to teach."
4,Solid read.,"Disagree with him on some points, but it's an interesting read. Note, this book is not really about how to make games you create fun, so much as it is a rambling discourse about the nature of fun itself."
2,It's perfecting skills.,"There, now you know the theory.This book has a lot of some interesting material in it. Mainly I enjoyed being pointed to other resources in his notes. As far as a theory of fun, he just says players like to grok the game environment. He then explores responsible game design among other issues with that paradigm in the forefront, taking a very flat look at games.Maybe if he gave this book a different title I would have liked it."
1,You should apply your 'fun' theroy to Star Wars Galaxies.,"Great book, Unfortunately, The 15 dollars a month I have been paying for the last year and a half now for your Star Wars Galaxies is anything but fun. I honestly don't know how Ralph can write a great book on the mechanics of games, and then not apply any of them to the actual games he works on. Many other games out (the newest World of Warcraft) actually rewards the player for playing, and investing time into the game. Now if he would follow the advice he gives about how a game should be fun, SWG would be a spectacular game. People play games to play, not to work! I really wish he would read his own writing and apply it to his games. And please, please, please, please stop dragging Star Wars, through the gutter to make a buck."
5,Excellent,"A must-read guide for every game designer or game designer wanna be out there. I was looking for something that explains how the brain works and why certain games are perceived different than others for different people and different genders. This is ""the"" book of game design!"
2,A Bit of a Letdown,"I didn't really feel like there was much of substance. The same items/examples were rehashed multiple times, but not in a way that made it a slow reveal or created a more profound understanding of that example in the context of what was being discussed. Quite frankly this was a quick read that had more nostalgia and self-justification for why making games is a real job than any real discussion behind a theory of what makes things fun. Don't get me wrong, he does bring up some valid points regarding the role that games play and always have played in society regarding teaching valuable lessons, but I felt that the real meat of this book could have been done in a quarter of the space than the already brief book spread it out across. This was especially surprising since this one of many books recommended by some rather highly regarded participants in the GamaSutra community."
4,What do We Know,This book has given me some insight that have lead me on what to know more about YAHWEH
3,OK,Very tiny book. Not very many common words. Disappointed. Will look for a different one. Do not recommend for travelers.
1,Mental,"Mental health professionals are at least regulated, in contrast to Scamontology which uses religious cloaking to avoid scrutiny. The author seems to think her life has improved by donating huge sums to dangerous cult."
5,Wonderful book,This is just a great book with a very important point. Very satisfying story that you just can't put down. Looking forward to the next book from this wonderful author!
5,Awesome Book,"Hey,I actually know the author, she is very awesome. She told me how much she she had to work and research to get the correct information and data.I thought that it was very true in a very frightening way. I think everyone should know of the evil the pshciatrists are spreading around, saying they are 'helping' people. Diane Klein does just that and I commend her for sticking a foot out to the wolves to get the truth out to the rest of us."
5,In the Name of Help,This book is a must read and one that I couldn't put down until done. We may like to think that evil isn't real and that evil things can't happen to us.....but after reading this book I don't think you will ever feel that way again. I know I won't. Psychiatric abuse is evil and it is real. Diane did a great job on this novel.
4,Already putting new traditions in place,A well written book offering some unique & interesting ideas for family traditions. Even provides some basic instructions & resource information.
1,DAZZLE DUD - WINDOWS XP NOT!!!,I've had nothing but trouble with this reader. Claims to be XP compatable but XP rejects it and Dazzle customer support is useless at best. If you have XP stay away.
1,Lots of 'Blue Screens of Death',"Had a great deal of trouble installing this on a Compaq Armada M700 laptop running Windows 2000. It runs on my Dell desktop running Windows 98 fine, but can't get through the install on the Compaq. Online support from Dazzle revealed little/no help (but did reveal a similar problem on Dell's running W2K). I tried what was recommended for the Dells (update BIOS, update to W2K Service Pack 2, plug in without USB dock, etc.) but nothing worked. Phone support was stumped after 2 hours. Tried installing on co-workers Compaq running W2k and had same results.Same symptoms occurred with Dazzle Multitech's Zio SmartMedia reader."
4,Not For The Faint Of Heart!,"Wow. I was impressed with her williness and ability to see the best in the religious right extremists, but when she revealed from how far on the other end of the spectrum she was writing I was dumbfounded. Her personal immersion in Sadomasochism juxtaposed against the controlling sweetness of the far right was jarring. I have long considered myself liberal but living as I do in the Bible belt I now find myself up on the fence fighting vertigo."
1,Ferocious Romance What My Encounters With the Right Wing Tau,"I'm a member of one of the churches mentioned in this book. I am both perplexed and bewildered at how a church with Democratic ministers and congregates who voted repeatedly for President Clinton, can be considered ""Right Wing"" as the title of Ms. Minkowitz book would suggest. Therefore, at the outset, I realized that factually this book had problems.The bizarre account of the author's sexual thoughts while a female soloist was singing a classic gospel hymn are disturbing. Her jest regarding laying a woman pastor down on the floor and cutting her up with a bread knife is alarming. My advice is to put your [money] to a better purpose."
5,intel pentium processor 3.0 ghz,was shipped in air tight package and was like almost new was very happy to get it and it worked just as it was suppose too i highly must say if you need to upgrade this one works well
1,Dissatisfied,The item was advertised with a rebate. When the product came there was a sticker intentionally placed across the UPC code on the container. My rebate was refused for an inappropriate upc code. I paid more for the product than it was worth. Equivalent photo managers are available other places for free.
3,"Nice, but different than shown","This rack is pretty nice. The construction is very simple so you're left with the feeling that it was a bit overpriced, but it works nicely and looks good.The rack that was delivered, however, doesn't look like the picture. In the picture the rails stick straight out, but the ones delivered slant upward at about a 30 deg angle. This isn't a big deal, but as shown it looks like you can mount the racks on a wall all the way up next to the ceiling, while still being able to use the top rack. With the angled rails, you have to mount it much lower onto the wall or else you can't get the board up and over the top rails (the rails will actually hit the ceiling if hung too high, making it impossible to use the top rack).Anyway, it looks fine and works fine, but be aware that what you see isn't what you get."
3,Nothing spectacular,"Costed me $40 for $2 in parts and 20 mins of labor. I would of made these myslef, but don't have any room for my tools in my small apartment. Needless to say, they do what they say they do, just a little upset they were so expensive."
1,Burn it yourself,"This is an interesting film, and something of a cult item, and I would love to buy a DVD of it. However, this is another in what appears to be a tidal wave of ""burn on demand"" discs from Warners, Fox, and some independents. All disc burners that I know about use a 480i quality, the same as standard def TV, and much worse than DVDs (480p, except for some junk discs). You can't use 480i in a home theater because it looks like fuzzy crap when blown up on a big screen. You can also burn it yourself for next to nothing if the film shows up on cable/sat. Charging $20 for this garbage (the disc, not the film) is absurd and, I fear, a harbinger of what's to come as studios abandon DVDs prematurely."
4,Good Book !,My daughter used the book for Goverment AP class - mandatory reading - and with no regrets. It really helps to understand the basis of the our Nation's goverment from an objective perspective. The light through which our founding fathers design the constitution is clearly depicted and fully explore with annotated references.
5,WOW!!!,"GREAT READ! Unbelievable amount of history on the subject here.Lots of wonderful pics.I can't say enough about how good this book is.A MUST HAVE/MUST READ for any auto enthusiast, but especially for Cobra owners."
5,Oldest is still the Best!,"Believe this to be the oldest video/film of this opera of any quality. Both Freni and Domingo were in their 30's and wonderful together. All the costumes and singing excellent. I liked the directing as well. The sets simple and lovely with a flashback beginning which was very different at the time it was made. I have many of videos, film and stage, made in subsequent years and none of them can begin to compare with this version. Freni will make you cry and Domingo is the overweight, if attractive heel that Pinkerton is supposed to be. I've seen it many times in person with many different singers and this video always comes to mind in comparison. Buy this Butterfly and enjoy the wonderful music full of Puccini's sentimentality! This is also a great gift for a newbie."
3,What happened?,"The music and acting are superior, but the image is faded. I was so disappointed. What has happened to the tape?"
1,Disappointed,"While the voices are fine, the production values are very disappointing. The video is poor and the audio is poor. The overall direction approach doesn't work. I'd much rather see a video of a stage production. After several emails to the seller, Moviemars, I received no satisfaction on return or substitution."
1,PAL or OTHER system,"I did look for a dvd like this but I did not found if it was PAL or other system, now I got the wrong system and I did send a mail to AMAZON without any reaction. It's not my way to make trouble and so I keep it but I know that the service is bad.Rob de Jong Holland"
5,Mesmerizing,"This version of Madama Butterfly is simply astonishing. Freni and Domingo are magnificent and Von Karajan, once again, proves to be the great maestro of all times. I watched this dvd with some friends and all of us were moved,some to tears, at the power of the performances."
3,The Many Faces of Madame Butterfly,"From the David Belasco play to Puccini's opera to Schonberg's Miss Saigon, there are many faces of Madame Butterfly. But none is any more exquisite than that of Mirella Freni-- especially as she sings the near-perfect aria, ""Un bel di"" and the Flower Song duet with Suzuki. However, Ponnelle, who staged and directed the film version, made Placido Domingo as Lt. Pinkerton a little too caddish for my taste. This version seems to resemble a faded memory that speaks not to the intellect but to the heart. It certainly deserves a place in any opera collection."
3,madama butterfly not my favourite,"We were disappointed with this first viewing of Madama Butterfly. We found it melodramatic rather than tragic which may be attributed to the production. The flashbacks, dream sequences and ""inner thought vocals"" were annoying, the lighting was poor and too contrived in many of the scenes, the staging was good but not great and fading between scenes was disastrous. The vocals were very good... but I love Freni."
3,Not well-adapted to a film format,"This version of Madama Butterfly is not well-adapted to a film format, I do not recommend it.The director doesn't seem well-acquainted with the medium. His direction is awkward, with clumsy cuts, poor camera work, a plodding pace and flat lighting. The added scenes, such as the opening sequence with a distraught Domingo, as well as the dream sequence during the humming chorus, are unimaginative and don't add anything to the story.The costumes and makeup, too, are unattractive. Freni looks like a ghost in her stark white makeup, and Domingo's attire in the love scene is wholly inappropriate -- a cheap-looking, blue-colored T-shirt that doesn't flatter his pudgy, middle-aged physique. He looks like he ought to be sitting on a sofa guzzling beer and watching football.The only pluses are the acting and singing of the principals, which are quite good throughout."
4,A Remarkable Album,"Tuckers music is unique. He is hard to place in any particular bag owing to his diverse range of material.He is very much a 'songwriter' of the old school although he does not shy away from comtempory sounds and (sometimes ) sonic mayhem.His vocal style is often compared with David Bowie and it is true that some songs on this album recall Bowies 'Hunky Dory' period.However, overall what comes across on this record is his originality and scope. A true English eccentric.Remarkable contains some of his best work although his most recent effort 'Fear Of Flying"" is destined to become a classic. If you are into Fear Of Flying and are wondering what he has done in the past Remarkable is a good place to start."
3,Good swimming goggles,"These goggles worked great for some fun at the pool but can have the tendency to leak, although I've experienced this with other goggles as well."
3,Very nice goggles but are better for my 7yr old daughter,"These goggles are very nice, extremely clear and are everything Amazon describes about them. But they fit my 7yr old much better than they do me and my head is NOT THAT BIG!! Even after trying many adjustments they are just uncomfortable for me.DD LOVES them. She can have them, so I have to keep looking..."
1,Are they serious?,"Simple Solutions makes the (very useful) Male Wrap product that these are supposedly for, so it's unbelievable that these pads are so useless. I thought these would be large flat pads that fit the wrap; instead, these pads are just really cheap maxi pads that cover maybe a third of the ""catch"" area. For the same price you can get a much bigger pack of human incontinence pads, and they work a lot better.If these pads totally covered the catch area, were a little thinner, were made with better quality (more absorbent) material, and cost about half as much, they'd be a winner. As it is, I have no idea what Simple Solutions was thinking putting this out."
1,Overpriced maxi pads,"Just go to the store and buy a bag of generic, thick maxi-pads because that's all these are."
1,Not worth the extra money,These are identical to women's maxi-pads but cost 3x as much. You'll save money if you simply buy an economy box of maxi-pads at your local store -- a truly simply solution.
4,"Good, but costly","These do a great job of absorbing. The total price in the long run is too expensive, as I recommend using the human super Maxi pads that you can buy at the store."
3,They work.,Thought I'd see how well pads made for an animal would absorb. They hold a lot for my unhousebroken little girl. Thank goodness.
3,Fair,This product is not for heavy incontinence. I am sure is perfect for light problems. I recommend it for this type of problems. Good price.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"These pads did little, purchase womens security pads, fit perfectly and does the job. These were over priced for the quality of absorbtion."
1,Way overpriced,"To be honest I have not bought these but who in there right mind would? 10 pack for $6-7? I don't think so! My puppy came into heat, I bought the washable covers that the liners go in. Then I purchased store brand panty liners. They work great and I paid $2 for 70+ liners. The great thing about buying Panty pads/liners instead of these is that you can buy higher absorbency Ones, So if you're using it for urine accidents it won't be as messy. Simple solution you have a great concept but way overpriced."
2,liner review,"These are far too small for any dog larger than the one on the packaging. They are nothing more than a Stayfree maxi pad. And those are not designed for urine. I used the liners with a large full diaper wrap, for my 15 year old German Shepherd that suffers incontinence over night. I used 4 of these liners inside the diaper,yet he and his bed were saturated in the morning. You might be better off getting a package of puppy diapers to use as liners. At least they have an absorbent gel that locks in the amount of urine that a large breed dog can produce. I have had my SnuggEase Washable Dog DiaperSnuggEase Washable Dog Diaper - Two Pack - XX-Large), for two days and have had to wash it out in as many days. The whole point of me purchasing the liners was to avoid having to do this..live and learn I guess. Off to Petsmart for a package of puppy diapers (free shipping when you go to the store ;-p"
3,"It's a fine product for spotting during heat, BUT...","It's nothing but a panty liner. I can't ding them too badly and give them a one star review because their product is so expensive, but I can say that I would never buy these again. Ten for $9.15? I bought a box of store-brand panty liners at the store today: 60 for $2.24. Less than 4 cents each versus ninety cents each? No thanks. If you want to buy from Amazon, buy this instead:Regular Unscented Dri-Liners 100 CountI used this for my girl when she was in heat and it was fine for catching that small amount of spotting. This would be useless for incontinence, unless your dog only ""dribbles"" a drop or two at a time."
2,Like Don Knotts leaving The Andy Griffith Show,"Having purchased and viewed seasons 1-5, I anxiously picked up this set when it was released. I had forgotten what an absolute nose dive this series took when Shelly Long left. While there are a few good episodes on this set, it is not one to watch repeatedly as are the first five seasons. The Rebecca/Evan Drake saga gets old REALLY quick. The wedding episodes of Carla and Eddie are two of the worst to this point in the series. And it seems the episodes have a tendency to leave the bar more often this season, which really takes away from the overall feel of the show.As for the DVD's, the picture is equal to the other five seasons, and there are again no extras.My recommendation....get the first five seasons and stop there. Even the 4th and 5th seasons showed some slip in quality with the loss of Nicholas Colasanto....but Woody Harrelson still does a pretty good job."
4,"love Becky, cd's less than great","I first bought this series from an Amazon store, at a reduced price, but the main menu ""wobbled"", and I couldn't fast forward thru the ads and junk at the beginning of the cd. I viewed the 1st 2 discs, then sent it back to the independent seller, and bought the set from Amazon, thinking I could fast forward thru the junk and the cd wouldn't be distorted. Both problems remain. Anyone else having this problem? My other cd's work fine."
3,What's happening to Sam?,"Well, I admit I'm biased towards the Diane years. I never quite enjoyed the Rebecca episodes as much back in the 80's and I fully expected to not like them as much now. Thing is, Rebecca isn't bad this season, comedy-wise. The problem is that the warmth and heart seems to have gone out of the show. In the Diane years, the characters cared about each other. Now, they just crack one-liners. Plus, what's happening to Sammy?? How can Sam Malone be losing it? I hate that; Sam's the ultimate womanizer. If he's losing his touch... well, I don't think that's a world I want to live in! In short, some very funny moments, but it's just not the same show."
4,"good, however, would prefer ""non- theme song"" option","I would like the option of ""play all"" without having to hear the theme song every time and without the credits. Also do not like the adverts. Beyond that it's good"
5,Every track will have you feeling,This is one of my favorite albums of all time in any genre. I wasn't even intending to buy music when I came across it at a nature / discovery shop. Now I own 2 copies of this CD and I plan to buy a few more as gifts to special people. Listen to the sample tracks for a taste of what you will be delighting your mind and heart to with this album. Each song takes me away from where I am at the moment I'm listening. Some tracks are faster tempo others slower but all exceptionally beautiful and deeply affecting.
5,All the Wizard of Oz Music!,"This is a great addition to your ""WIZARD OF OZ"" Collection. I hae a copy of it and it's done very well. You can also get to hear many of the outtakes music stuff from the movie and that's really neat to hear too. There is also a wonderful extended verison of ""Over The Rainbow"" by Judy Garland when she filmed the movie she sang the song a few times but it ended up that they had to keep redoing the song a few times as heared on the CD because she ended up crying!"
4,A Classic To Remember,"This is an interesting soundtrack to listen to, even if the sound is a little muffled. It's definitely for all ''Wizard of OZ'' fans. By the way, you can hear a new recording of ''The Jitterbug'' on a new CD called 'Silver Screen Serenades' by recording artist Michael Poss. It has a nice big band arrangement with a little extra sparkle. This was the song that was cut from the second screening back in 1939. The movie executives thought it would date the movie."
5,Impressive sound quality,"Sure, the music is over sixty years old, but Rhino CDs are the best in sound quality and this is no exception. I am very pleased with the sound quality and it was worth the price (each CD is a picture disc).The outtake of ""Over the Rainbow"" should be reason enough to get this CD. Kids will love the instrumental tracks for play acting many of the movie's scenes.I'm happy with it, I think you will be, too."
4,Festival of Family Classics Vol 1,"""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""20000 Leagues under the Sea""This DVD is twice the 45 min running time of Vol 2 or Vol 3.These two stories were the two in the Festival of Family Classics 1971 series, which were two parters.Appropriately grouped together on this DVD, they appeal not only to Rankin Bass fans, but also readers of the author Jules Verne, whose novels were the basis of both stories.So you're actually getting not two, but four episodes.Check out my detailed review for Volume 2, especially Australian buyers."
4,Insightful look...,"This book offers a new and insightful look into the tangled, intriguing life of Lady Day. However, it only has ONE photo of the legend in the entire book. I would like to have seen more photos, copies of documents mentioned, and other visual aids included. That's about the only negative thing about this book. A must have for the Billie collector."
3,Rehash,This is a rehash of interviews that were used much better by Stuart Nicholson. How Julia Blackburn can take credit for writing a book is beyond me.As for Billie Holiday I love her work and her lifestyle was for the times the story of many black women that will forever go untold.Prostitution was rampant during the great depression and any reader who wants to moralize best do so on a empty stomich. As for billes ghost wrtitten biography if you read it properly then read stuart nicholsons work u will see many truths that beforehand were thought of as lies. This book disappointed me greatly and I've read evry damn book they have written about her. Thank god I read it 4 free at the libary. Its not bad but it isn't good either
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I am no stranger to fitness dvd's. I have quite a collection going, mainly because I get bored with exercise so easily so I need to change it up. Being pressed for time, I'm always interested in a quick workout. This is by far the WORST dvd I have ever purchased.First, the workouts are well over 40 minutes. Second, the upper body movements are dangerous. They involve throwing and jerking motions with hand weights that left me in a lot of pain (and not the good kind).Third it was boring. Repeating the same moves for four, five cycles. There are much better dvds out there. Don't waste your money!!!!"
5,The classic,"The Compleat Klezmer is the classic book in its field. Many of the tunes in this book represent the standard core repertoire with which any klezmer band should be familiar. The explanatory first chapter is a rich source of information about the music. When I was starting out, this book was my bible and it is still the one I would recommend to any beginner. Musicians should make sure to obtain the spiral bound edition. Those who are not primarily musicians will find the explanatory text and accompanying photographs and notes interesting, though the book is mainly geared toward players."
5,well done,She has a wonderful voice and a good message to go with it. She exudes sincerity and talent.
2,Bad sound quality,I was very disappointed with this purchase. The sound quality is terrible! I had to turn it down during the music sequences and crank it up to hear anyone singing. It sounds like someone put a recorder up next to the TV screen and recorded it while watching the movie.
3,wizard of oz item,happy with the product because my daughter enjoyed listening to wizard of oz songs .
3,"Great idea, but not entirely comfortable.","I purchased this bra because I thought it was a great idea to hold my polar heart rate monitor. It does work great, but the bra is cut too high on my chest and I found that the material rubs on my chest which is quite annoying.Also, purchasing through BikeSomeWhere was a bit of a hassle. I ordered a medium as I'm a 34B and the bra was too small. After three emails and a phone call, I finally got a response from the company on how to exchange for a size large.It all worked out in the end. I do like how the hear rate monitor sits comfortably in the slits in the bra, but until they do a re-design, I wouldn't purchase another one."
4,Polar Sports Bra Works well,"The Polar Sports Bra works well with the heart monitor. I was not sure if I needed to use the elastic, but it did not work without it. The instructions were not very complete. You need to make sure the elastic band keeps the monitor snugly against your body. The bra itself is not going to hold the monitor snugly in place without the elastic."
5,Wonderful,I am an amateur photographer. 90% of good photography is in finding the right subject. These photos are stirring.
2,Misleading Title,"This title is misleading. Although I read this entire book, it is not about the tools for Peak Performance as much as it is an investigative journalist's study of the technologies being used, and those that have been developed by governments for the control of other people or the manipulations of their brainwaves. Lots of technical information, nothing in the way of usable tools for an individual to use in controlling their own mind or for achieving peak performance. This is more of a masters degree paper on the subject of these technologies than a book for learning anything new. Almost a historic look at the development of these tools. Careful on why you buy this book...it may not be what you want if you base your purchase on the title of the book."
1,Awful!,"While the garlic is cut into nice pieces with this, this is really hard to use (you need to really press down on the top) and almost impossible to clean."
3,Great but Fragile,"I bought this garlic mincer in July and used it nearly every day. It works great, I just loved it. It only lasted through November; just a little over 4 months. It just fell apart. So disappointed! I'm looking for a different mincer."
5,this is just great,"Hah, hah, hah! BONE will surely have you laughing out loud. Jeff Smith has managed to conjure a bunch of great characters, all with their different pros and cons, and thrown them all into a wonderful world of childish fantasy. The three Bone cousins, Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone, have been run out of Boneville (due to Phoney Bone's many scrupelous schemes) and, much to their dislike, soon finds themselves in a battle against The Lord Of The Locusts, who is threatening to take over a peaceloving community in a quiet and peaceful valley. Moments of Laugh. Moments of Suspense. Moments of Joy. Moments of drama. And many, many, many moments of sheer magic."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Ok, whimsical sort of comic, at times. I can see where this would be quite popular with kids, with its cross between Disney comics and the look of casper the ghost, wendy the little witch, hot stuff, and all those sort of gohst line of characters. This is what it reminded me of, anyway. Not enough to want to read any more though."
5,"Fine graphics suite, feature-rich and stable","This is probably the most stable and solid release of theCorel graphics suite I've used. It has all the featuresnecessary for illustration and photo editing, and at a pricefar lower than competing products from Adobe. Nice job,Corel!"
2,Not really worth it,"It doesn't work too well. The rack wobbles as you ride and makes riding in general more difficult. Wind also makes it a lot harder to control your bike. It would be alright for short distances, like less than a mile, but you might as well carry your board for something like that."
3,Decent rack,"The bike rack itself was good enough. I did end up switching to a side mount, because I kept grinding off my tail. Not to mention it's difficult to strap down the board well enough without leaving marks. To solve the marks I would wrap my board in my towel."
3,Inconsistant,"I really liked the early part of the book, but inconsistancies occur in the methology as you progress into real game situations where you would seek position off the object ball. Although it's not great, it is still worth the cost to open your mind to new possibilities."
2,I am being generous with this 2.,"I am a league player rated a 5. I can make shots and banks. I am not the best player and I'm not the worst player. I was looking for a book that gave a solid kicking system.This book tells you nothing you cannot find out from another good player at a hall. The fomula given is usable. Unfortunately, it is not explained too well. The examples on the 3 and 4 rail kicks lack in quantity. The illustrations lack variations in shots and explanations on how to make a reasonable adjustment. A beginning pool player is not going to follow it. The other information in this book can be found in other books which are better written. 99 Critical Shots of Pool contains all this information and more.This is not for the beginner. If you don't know english or have a good stroke, you will not benefit from this. This book assumes you already have the basics behind you.I don't recommend this book.Buy a tip pick instead. Or some chalk. Or a soda."
2,good at first but i got lost,"I thought i finally found a book that explained the diamond system and was getting it but then to book moved on to areas that i could not find explained earlier than i got lost. examples shown did not always show all the needed information to fully understand and decipher. after reading the other reviews i must be a ree, everyone seems to love it. i am at about a 25 ball run on regrular basis."
2,Statler Farewell,Unless I got some pirated copy from amazon. (It ended up being a pal recording and was not advertised as so. and I feel the seller falsely listed it) I was disapointed that the entire show including all comentary was not on the dvd. It was just inserts of each song and not the full show leaving out all the funny remarks from Harold and it takes away from the full impact of the show.
5,At their best...,The best of a long and illustrious career. All the tunes that made these guys so successful and well loved.
4,Always a pleasure listening to the Statlers,"While I enjoy having the last concert by this delightful foursome, I felt their presentation was less than stellar. Lots of the songs are rushed with sped-up tempos, The group will be missed."
4,Excellent Background Material,"To read Kohelet is to enter into the world of the realist who has become embittered and cynical, but not altogether wrong. As becomes apparent in Seow's volume, Kohelet is written (and probably codified into the Tanach) as in contradistinction to Mishlei (Proverbs). The volume is extensive and the interpretations quite well-thought out and valid. It is rare for the author to favor one interpretation over another which is refreshing since it does not appear that Seow has an axe to grind one way or the other. I would have liked to have seen more aggadic and talmudic references to the verses but that was not overly forthcoming. Still, it is an excellent volume for adult ed and has lots of good sermon material in it. It is especially fun to teach it at the same time you are teaching Proverbs.Rabbi Cy StanwayTemple Beth Miriam, Elberon, NJ"
4,TG - The Songs You Love So Well,"I agree that this isn't a definitive TG collection - where is ""Persuasion"" or ""Weeping"" and nothing from ""Heathen Earth"" - but it's still enjoyable enough. ""Slug Bait"" is actually more listenable here backwards as ""Tiab Guls"". By the way one of your US reviewers mentioned something about ""United"" being a top 10 hit in the UK - in your dreams pal! I can only assume he's confusing this ""United"" with the identically titled top 10 hit of the same era by those well-known Industrial pioneers, Judas Priest!"
3,Throbbing Gristle - 'Greatest Hits' (Mute),"Was never aware that Throbbing Gristle even had any hits. Decent compilation of Gristle's trademark experimental / industrial sounds for you to thoroughly 'take in'. Good thing about Throbbing Gristle is that most of their music is JUST barely too strange for most, while at the same time acceptable by many. Does that make much sense? Tunes here that I thought were fairly good were ""Hamburger Lady"", the just plain weird ""Subhuman"", the noisy ""What A Day"" and ""Adrenalin"". Might appeal to fans of Skinny Puppy, Controlled Bleeding, Nurse With Wound and KMFDM. Check it out."
5,this IS essential,"Essential. Essential. Essential. That's all I can say. Know your roots, rivethead!"
3,What the hell?,"At first I thought this would be some real industrial rock from the first known industrial band. But I got something completely different. This is just ALOT of random noises. Some of it freaks me out because this was Throbbing Gristle's plan to shock and annoy off-guard listeners. There's only a few actual songs on here that are actually normal. The last track ""Adrenalin"" is really good for something made in the 70's.I don't know what else to say, if you like pure industrial music then pick this up, but if you're a fan of Ministry, KMFDM, NIN and other acts then you might wanna avoid this and wait til you can handle what goes on."
1,Horrid!,"Ugh! I bought this many, many years ago (LP) because the name of the band intrigued me. What a major mistake! Even now, years later, the banal, wounded animal growlings of ""Subhuman"" echo in my brain. When they're not yelling at the listener, the other tunes (and I use the term loosely) is talentless, uninspired syntho (and I like techno) that could have been done with a child's first keyboard. Be afraid! Be very afraid!"
1,Great Production /Horrible Casting,"Quality production as usual from HB,but the girls on this dvd look like a bunch of your typical run-of-the-mill over-bleached pornstar bimbos.I like my blondes natural and without the cheap tattoos and piercings thank you very much.1 star for Antoinette and Kellemarie,but thats about it. Definitely not worth 20 bucks for sure !!"
3,Broke leg mommy,"""Broken Leg Mommy"" - That is the name my 2 year old gave this doll when the leg broke off after the 2nd day. There was clearly a production issue with the particular doll as the leg did not move freely before it broke. We have several other Loving Family dolls and have not had this problem. Since they are so ""affordable"" I just went and bought another set. It was not worth any hassle to return the product. Besides, by then the damage was done. The new mommy's name is ""Fixed Leg Mommy"". Both of my girls (2 & 4) play with both dolls. My husband says it is a good lesson that some people real people have limitations. I was pretty annoyed with the lack of Quality Assurance and would gladly pay more for these products if it meant they did a final inspection of the toy before putting it in the box."
4,Great stuff!!!!!,"I came to learn of this cd through Vernessa's web site, while I was looking for a dance single. This cd is awesome! I'm not a gospel music buyer, but this cd did something to me. I really can't explain it. There's something about it. Great voice, great music, great songs. I'm keeping my eye on her."
4,Nativity,Very happy to find a copy of this animated bible story that we watched with our daughter and now want to pass it on to beautiful grand daughters!
3,"OK, But......","Fits nicely on a nightstand, has good-sized time display (for us very near-sighted people)and the nature sounds are nice. Unfortunately, there is definitely a low hum coming from the speakers when the radio or CD are playing. I have clock radios from Timex and Sony that have clear sound(the Timex has better radio reception for me) so I'm not ready to hear a HUM for the added CD feature -It's being returned right now!"
2,You can do better,"I have had this for only a week but here are my impressions so far. The display is way too bright, you can almost use it for a reading lamp. The sound is ok but nothing great. I have not noticed any humming sound in it like the other reviewers however. The nature sounds are nice except for the wind one which just sounds like static. Overall I think you could do much better than this."
2,Returning this to the store!,"After my wonderful Panasonic CD clock radio bit the dust after my ten year old pounded the top of the CD player with his fist, I settled on this Timex model. After only one night I know it is going back to the store. The hum when playing a CD is so loud it practically kept me up all night when listening to a ""relaxation"" CD to lull me to sleep! The radio is awful and we can't pick up ANYTHING! This box isn't worth $10 of my money, let alone $50. The only redeeming quality is the nature sounds, which I enjoy waking up to, but I can always buy a CD with those."
4,"Worked fine for me, until CD player stopped working","I've loved this little alarm clock. I haven't had the problems with humming, etc., although after having it about a year and a half, the CD player has stopped working. It's not cheap to replace; I'm going to see if I can get a free replacement from the manufacturer. The newer model has a plug-in for your mp3 player, which seems like a nice feature."
4,Can't Help Myself,"I read this in one setting. Like always, about half way through Bukowski has us hanging our heads and shaking them in amazement. I'm not sure what he left out of this novel, but it wasn't much. Bukowski throws in the kitchen sink and then ties it all together. Bukowski shows us life from the crud under our fingernails to analysing our vomit and on to internal motivations. The whole time he keeps the story line going. Bukowski is really up against the whole world in this one, and then some to include space aliens and the un dead. Luckily for him he's just unsavoury enough that no one really wants him spending eternity with them. In the end Bukowski will have you rooting for the good guy and wishing fatal accidents on his adversaries. Save plenty of hot water because you'll want a bath after this one. -Mike"
1,terrible,"Don't get me wrong, Bukowski has written more than his share of masterpieces--but this is clearly not one of them. It's awful, the worst tripe. It is supposed to be a parody--and it simply does not work, neither does that other one The Captain is Away and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship. In my opinion these two titles never should have been published.I suggest, to those not familiar with Buk's material, they try one of these titles: Women, Post Office, Hollywood, South of No North (short stories), or some of his poetry, etc. Don't waste your money on Pulp."
1,truely awful,"If you're a fan of Buk, and you liked Post Office or Women or Factotum, then you'll probably HATE this book. It's truely awful. The writing is bad, is not funny, and has no real logic to it. I know that Buk was trying to write a parody novel of early detective stories, but I call this an experiment gone wrong. I don't know why the reviews are so good on this book. Don't buy this book."
1,junk,I could hardly get by the first few pages before i donated this to a library book sale. Do not bother with it...
1,Worse thing he ever wrote!!,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Bukowski fan. Post Office is a great novel and Women is pretty damn good also, but this is just awful. If this was his first ever novel, it would never have been published. Bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then I can believe why. Pulp, is just a very bad book. The story is stupid, the plot is a mess, the characters are dumb. The only good thing about it is it's short. It's a shame to read something so bad from someone I used to love to read. Stay well away from this book, you will only be very disappointed."
1,The Buk's Biggest Joke on us.,"I have read most but not all of Bukowski. When he's at his best I think he is a fantastic writer. He's talking to ME while seated at his typer. There are big changes in his writing post 1985. Pulp is the biggest. I can hear him laughing. ""Will they eat anything?"" I wouldn't be suprised if he wrote the book in a two hour sitting. Not much to take awy from this one."
2,Finally found a Bukowski book I don't like,"Well I have finally ran across a Bukowski book I don't like. Cliche ridden detective story, (yes I realize that some of those cliches were put there intentionally, but still) and Bukowskis attempts at humor for the most part fall flat."
3,Last Hurrah,"Bukowski's own ""Old Man and the Sea."" Instead of sharks, his protagonist fends off long dead French writers, space aliens, and Death herself. There are plenty of references to Bukowski's own life and career, so it helps to know a little about him before reading this work. Quick read. Whatever."
4,"Funny stuff man, funny stuff","I doubt the critics will like this kind of book, but who the hell cares? It's a larf, it is. Bukoswki tells an off beat and colorful story about an aging, alchoholic LA detective. Its good. Enjoy."
5,insane - different,"Still 20 pages to go but this is one of the best bukowski books. Different from all the other novels and full of really strange and unreal things. Or real. I really liked it, shame it's coming to an end so fast."
1,"It's bad, baby...","I saw a documentary on ""Hank"" Bukowski, and thought I'd give him a day in court. This was the only work of his available at the library, so this is what I sampled. It's crap. A waste of time. Bukowski's reputation certainly can't rest on this alone. Did he pull an esoteric fast-one, and write this just for the initiated? Maybe. The book still sucks."
2,Clever at best.,"This was Bukowski's last published work before he died. It's an old-fashioned detective novel, or a parody of one, and an allegory about a man getting ready to die. It's clever at best. There are some great one-liners. At worst, it's convoluted and easy. Taken in context of Bukowski's life, it's a big middle finger to all the literary elitism Bukowski despised. But as a stand-alone book, it's little more than its title suggests: pulp. Fluff. And if you're not interested in Bukowski's life, this book has little to offer."
3,"Critics are right, not his best, but...still enjoyed it","If you like Buk, you'll like it, easily. Sure, it's sloppy, and even the dedication page says ""dedicated to bad writing"". Buk knew it - but still, enjoyed the read. If you're a fan of his, it's just one of those things, you know you're going to get it eventually."
4,Funny book,"The main character is funny and real. He drinks a lot, is depressed with life most of the time but keeps investigating."
1,"Another ""Hits"" album - destined to be heavily discounted","Another in the saturated ""hits"" of an era album. One can find a similar offering at the bottom of the discount bins at your CD outlet. Wait a while and this will be found there too."
1,I was very displeased when I put the dvd in it was legal for this region.( the U.S.A),was not a legal copy for U.S.A. Could not watch it.I was very displeased. The provider new it was for the U.S and should state these products are not for the U.S.A are any areas they should not be viewed.
5,Outstanding Service,"This is my daughter's ""pen of choice"" during college. Both times I've placed orders, my daughter has received them within days. Couldn't ask for any better service."
1,NOT WHAT EXPECTED,The product was definitly not what I expected... I don't think I would purchase anything again from this seller..
3,NaturalCare Hear All,Tried it to help with Tinnitus. Can't say it works. Will not purchase it again.
1,What does it do?,"I tried this product in hopes that my tinnitus would, at least dim a little. No such luck. It has had no effect at all on me."
3,HearAll,"I have tried three bottles of HearAll. So far I haven't noticed a dramatic improvement in my hearing; however, it hasn't gotten worse either. My dad is a retired pharmacist, and he says that the formula in the product is good. I will keep using it for awhile."
2,Hear All,As in Optiall which the same company sells for vision-not too impressed with Hear Alls claims! Didn't do a thing for me
4,Hearall capsules,"I found Hearall very effective for improvement in hearing. Of course it is early days yet, and I can only give final opinion after using the capsules for a few months."
4,HearAll,This was a gift and the customer said that it worked very well as to his hearing and helping with the tinnitus.
1,It's a poor job by Lawrence Block,"This particular book is just offensive. The main character, Evan Turner, gets an assignment to go to a fictional African nation. In his adventures, he, of course, beds another nymphomanic, hot for his secret agent body. The only problem: Turner enjoys a little pedophilia in that part. Part of his work is to eliminate a beautiful white terrorist nymphomaniac running around the jungles in Africa. Right.Too many of the passages in the book, through the eyes of any person today, forty years later, would be seen as just plain racist, homophobic, pedophilic and misogynistic. This book just isn't funny, like the other Evan Tanner novels. It does not hold together, and it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes, Block's books can sag a little and then pick up. This one goes for the cellar and never comes up.I love almost all the books by Lawrence Block. This one should stay unbought."
4,"Amazing from day 1, and 10$ cheaper than in the store!","These sandals are amazing!When I first tried a pair on in the store, I was surprised at how much more comfortable they were than the designer (40$) pair of sandals I was wearing.They are especially more comfortable at the ball of my foot and heel areas.One complaint is the cord/binding that separates your big toe from the rest slightly pinches after a full day of walking around. Not sure if this is because the shoe is being held snug against my foot (for correct support?), or because of the design, or because I have weird feet.Even with the minor pinching, I would still rather wear these sandals than any other pair.Once I wore these sandals for a week I gave away my old sandals that were still in good condition. Try a pair on at the store to make sure you are getting the correct size and never go back to another brand for casual, sunny-day footwear."
4,"Product good, but mix up on sizes","I've actually owned these sandals before I bought a pair from amazon, and five stars for the product.Unfortunately amazon sent size 6 when I ordered 9. I'm sure it was a clerical error and I would have sent the back if I hadn't spaced it. And miss the time I had to return it."
4,Welllll!!!,"The product looked great out of the box. I took them with me to Aruba last week and the are starting change shape... maybe from the rinsing after the pool and beach??? Also, the cheap red, yellow, and green stickers fell off. They are still very comfortable and look great casual or with a nice summer slack and shirt. I guess time will tell![...]"
2,Doesn't work for me,"I had issues with the strap chaffing my toes. After wearing these to the beach and walking a couple of blocks after, I developed a fairly large blister on my toe and found these too painful to wear."
3,OK,"This case is strong but i have one complaint. There is no place to put anything besides you sax! there is no where for your neck strap, cork grease, or reeds!"
3,Early Short Story - Diverting But Untypical,"Iris Murdoch's novels are deep and intricate, peopled by complex characters engaged in philosophical struggles, narrated in strong and forthright terms by a writer lovingly in search of human goodness. This recently rediscovered simple short story is pleasantly diverting, but there is nothing in it of the complexity or interest of her later writing, nothing of the dense philosophical discourse which motivates so many of her characters; this is a dated, urban tale of inexperienced love which I, for one, would not have guessed to be by Ms. Murdoch, even at her youngest. It is the lightest of reads, mainly of historical interest to the author's fans, perfect in length and depth for a doctor's waiting-room.The illustrations add much charm to this exceptionally thin volume."
4,Fair price for a bag of screws,"I have no complaints with these replacement screws. I do have a small complaint with why so many are necessary. These screws screw into vibram rubber knobs on the bottom of the stabilicers, and they periodically work themselves out. I try to keep them tightened but notice after every third or forth use that one or two have gone missing.Stabiliers should have embedded metal nuts into the knobs, so that one could secure them better with loctite. I'm worried that the problem may worsen as the rubber screw holes wear.If you use your stabilicers frequently, I would recommend buying a couple of bags."
4,Good Quality... size is the issue,"I got these for my husband for Christmas. I ordered the large hoping they would fit his size 12 pack boots. They of course do not. They fit his combat boots, my pack boot, and all our other shoes. The whole reason I bought these were for his ice fishing adventures he has every winter. Its not a total waste since they do fit all our other shoes. Pack boots are HUGE so we will order the 3X size cause I think they will actually fit."
3,OUTTAKES,"What can I say, the Outtakes were the best part. The story was not original, but it was still ok. Problem is for the most part, the acting very well could have been the worst I've ever seen in a movie. They were much more convincing doing the interviews for one of the extras on the DVD. There was a lot of bad dialogue also. Parts were laughable. I would have given it 2 stars, but I gave 3 based on the Outtakes. They were pretty funny."
4,Better than I expected,"I really enjoyed watching The Last Year. I found it to be a very intelligent gay movie. It's about acceptance and finding out who you are. I rented the moviea, and I like it so much that I decided to purchase the movie from Amazon. The acting was very good. I really liked Mike Dolan and Merrick McMahon. I was not bored at all with The Last Year. It raises a lot of very important questions about being gay and religious beliefs. I think Mike Dolan is a very talented actor and very handsome too. :). I receommend this movie to anyone that appreciates great storytelling."
5,Well Worth Seeing,"It would be best for Christian ethicists to see this movie. Yet those are the people most unlikely to watch it.Still, the situations are well portrayed in an almost ""DEBATE""-like mode, presenting many sides of the situation, tho' very contrived at times. Thusly the generalized Homophobia is presented within a Christian format but with a well documented rebuttal.The main actors deliver REALLY good performances while the minor acting is very stilted. There is some good ""skin"" but no nudity. There are problems with the ""video"" of the film- very ""soap-opera-ish"". Well-done cinema angles.The anti-right wing argument is well presented verbally and visually... as it is vice-versa. The emotions are real...but if lessons are to be learned-- it may not be by those who need to learn them since they won't be the ones watching this movie.For anyone not subscribing to the American ""status quo"" this movie presents well the actual ""reality"" of our times ... tho' many will deny it."
2,not that great,It has selective footage of the experienced of one person. Most of the footage is not interesting except for 3 of them.. I didn't like it. I was expecting more of a documentary and not a story telling of how one individual attracts ufo sightings..
5,A long overdue anecdote to Warfieldism,"In this book, Ruthven systematically and carefully refutes a sacred cow of American protestantism that should have been put out to pasture a long time ago - namely the B.B. Warfield philosophy. Warfield's ideas have seemingly been uncritically accepted by many theologians over the years. Few, if any, have taken the time to apply his own standards to his theological system to find out if it stands. Ruthven does the job masterfully in this book and shows not only the errors of the classic Warfield/cessationist view from a Biblical standpoint, but also rightfully points out that Warfield appealed to history (and therefore experience) in an attempt to support his position. This is significant in light of the fact that so many who accept this Princeton theologian's arguements claim that they ""go by the Bible alone, never by experience."""
5,Outstanding,"Ruthven has presented an outstanding response to the argument set forth in B.B. Warfield's early 20th century classic ""Counterfeit Miracles.""Thiose interested in the cessationist debate would do well to read Warfield's book along with Ruthven's more than competent response."
5,I love this book,Each story has its own heart warming experience that are really wonderful. This book shows that you could get something that you dream off at the least expeted place and that what's make life is so great:)
3,No Mario Kart,"This game features a lot of unlockables that can be used when playing against other people which is cool but the controls aren't the most responsive and the touch screen process of getting a boost in the beginning is kind of lame and feels tacked on. I'm also not all that crazy about the story mode either.All in all, not a bad game but if you've mastered Mario Kart and are looking for something else like it, you are likely to be very unimpressed."
5,Fun Game,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter because it was on her wish list. She loves the game and plays with it often.
2,Not much fun,"This game was a lot less fun for me than Mario Kart. The vehicles in this game handle horribly, and races are very hard to win. When I first started the game, it was all right. But as I progressed, it got less fun. This game is worth buying only if it on sale, or a good used price."
4,Donkey goes racing finally ....,"Donkey Kong Racing DS works well as a standalone or with multiple players. Although late to the racing games already available (mario Racing and Cartoon Netowrk Racing), the game has a twist. You have the choice or regular racing using a kart, or now using a hoover craft or an airplane. So, although late to the game .. it's made up by the other racing vehicles."
3,A Little Bit of a Let Down...,"I had heard all these good reviews about Diddy Kong Racing from the gaming magazines and when I got it home I was a little disappointed. The races are fairly easy to win, the story's kind of boring, and you have to do research on who in the world all these characters are (unless you're a big Donkey Kong fan). I wouldn't recommend spending the full MSRP for this game because it's just too easy to win (and it's not fun when you're lapping the person in 2nd place...)."
4,Grandchild Pleaser,"This game arrived promptly and in perfect condition. My grandson really loved it. He plays it very often. This was the best price that I found for it, too."
3,Bland when compared to Mario Kart DS,"I've been playing this game for a few weeks and find it to be a boring. I've played with friends using the wireless functionality, but even still it's not as engaging as Mario Kart DS.As the title states, the levels are bland. Nothing exciting here. No matter what vehicle you use you never feel like you're going fast.You don't get the same thrill and rush that Mario Kart DS provides.I would have thought the folks over at Nintendo would have put some more time and effort into this title as it could have been fun, but I was disappointed.It doesn't have much re-play value as its Mario Kart DS counter part.Yeah, yeah I know it sounds like I'm a Mario Kart DS fan boy, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.As far as ""Kart"" games go, I would go for Mario Kart DS and skip this title."
5,fantastice,i ordered this for my daughter for easter so she hasn't played it yet but she will be thrilled. i am suprised at how fast i recieved the item. thank you so much!
5,donkey kong,"one excellent game and a nice product, worth every penny and i most definitely needed it for my son. a purchase that you couldnt get a better price. excellent product and a recommended buy"
4,Son loved it!!,"My son loved it for Christmas!! He enjoys playing it and plays it for hours. Works great, fast shipping, and no problems!!"
4,GO ONLINE and YOU'll LOVE IT!,"This game is a replica of the old N64 game. Except on this outing, the single player game is not much better than below average. Sure there is some good parts for the casual gamer that is not too hard on games. However, if you are a video game reviewer or a world class player, you will find this game has many shortcomings in the single player mode ... Well, it stinks. Now, on the other hand, the online play rocks. THis really seals the deal for this game. So in short summary, if you can't get online and your a casual gamer, rent the game. If you can get online, and you have a friend or two that can too, its worth the purchase.I hope this helps!"
2,Taylor's first review,"The game is just OK, not as good as all the hype. I wish I had not spent the mopney on it."
3,Good book,As there are not many available titles on the subject of Garde Manger specifically this is a good starter book. I wish it would have gone into more depth however.
3,Pretty good while it lasted,"I gave this mug 3 stars because it has the best lid design for traveling (I carry mine on the outside of a small backpack, which often gets tipped around in my car, and the lid - when closed - cannot spill), but it failed me yesterday after about a year of use - the bottom fell off. I picked it up off my desk, and the bottom (a small disk of metal with the non-skid pad attached) was still sitting where the cup had been. Turns out that the metal base is only attached with about 6 small spot welds. This also allowed my to peer into its insides where there is no insultation evident. This explains why it never kept coffee as hot for as long as my Starbucks stainless press (great cup, but not good for long drives if you're the driver). I'll be looking for a genuine vacuum design next time. Disappointing (mine was red, BTW)."
4,Quite the best travel mug I've ever used,"I love coffee, I love tea, I love drinks that don't spill on me...and this is the best mug I've found yet. It's easy to use, dishwasher safe, and while it does drip a bit, it simply will not spill, and that's good enough for me. It's durable too; having taken some severe drops and falls, it lives. I do find that keeping it clean is crucial to the seal--all that coffee goo builds up after a while--but beyond that there's not a whole lot to complain about. My version does not have a handle, but it does have a rubber grip, and a mini-biner on a loop at the handle. While you might well ask, ""what good is that?"" I'll tell you, it's come in handy when I want to carry the mug with me and I don't have a spare hand. I just clip it onto my computer bag! No drips, no third hand needed. Highly, highly recommended."
3,Just OK,"These fit nicely in the cup holder but I have found them to leak a bit occasionally. I purchased 2 and the tops on each are opposite, so you can't drink the same direction from both. We've used these for 2 years and the paint is starting to chip in the bottom."
2,leaks,vaccum seal is a bit tricky. It is either so tight it let nothing through or it is so loose it leaks on you.
4,the geode adventure,According to my son the only misadventure regarding the geode was a slight spill (oops) when putting the geode ingredients together. I think it still had a happy ending and the room actually glowed in the dark not just the geode :)
3,what's wrong with clanking tins & clashing cymbals?,"i like this album. Period. 3 stars because it's not THAT repetitive to be annoying. I like my albums annoying. So one of your friend will spot this cd in your collection & while laughing nervously he is going to ask you, is that panasonic, the band? they're like cabaret voltaire/can of our generation ain't they?They say panasonic is a pretentious band. Ask them what's wrong with good, ole pretentiousness?One star each for the facts that1) it's good to test your speaker2) it's great to annoy someone else, play this while they're trying to sleep3) it's actually listenable & to think that this came out in 97 (pre fennesz, mum, vespertine, boc), track 7 & 8 are especially great. Your cat will strain its ears to this!Annoy people ( & animals) with your music (hopefully, pretentious music)!"
3,"Fun to read, but confusing!","I couldn't really figure out why Lord Wyland fell in love with Mary so fast. Later he says it is her honesty, but she is not really honest with him in many ways. She hides her love from him. How was she able to resist his lovemaking? All because she thought he was in love with another woman? I can't believe they didn't talk even if it was in anger. Even the vicar was a sad and confusing character - if he cared for Mary why didn't he act on it in five years?The buying of bonnets was a nice touch. The story was ok. I just kept waiting for revelations to explain why things were the way they were and the answers never came! I still had fun reading this book and have enjoyed others by Joy Reed -- but this will not be on my keeper shelf."
3,DOES NOT SHIP WELL,"The paper is the standard HP paper and good quality, but it was not shipped well through the USPS. The carton came broken and the first few reams were broken also. This was not the first time it was shipped like this as my first order came the same way. If it had been shipped through UPS it may have come in better condition. I sent a review of the shipping method to Amazon and maybe they will listen to it. I used Amazon Prime to ship and usually UPS is used but not in this case so I will not buy it again. Perhaps you will have better luck. The price is fair."
5,If you DM you need this book!,"I just began DMing my own AD&D game and without this book I would be lost. This book has everything that a DM needs to know such as treasure, a nice list of some magical itmes, and other things. Another reviewer of this book said that the psionics should be in here. I don't agree because this has all the basic things needed psionics is only used by advanced DMs and if they want to use it they should refer to the Complete of Guide of Psionics."
4,"Very good, but has a few errors.","First off, it relys on the player's handbook a lot. Next, remember that there are a few errors(for example, putting arrows and other piercing weapons under the catagory slashing weapons). However, it is a good book for new DMs. I recomend this book to future DMs and only of you already have and read the Player's Handbook."
2,not worth $25,"If you've read the player's handbook, you don't need this book. it has terrible artwork, and the only use ful section is the magical items. if you can just barrow one from someone and read that section."
4,its informative,"It was great, but the artwork kinda sucked. Anyway it really helped me.(when i was a beginning player)."
2,Mythology of dogs,"Mostly a dog book with descriptions of the different breeds, their histories, interesting facts and a few references to mythology. It is an interesting book about dog breeds, but does not have much content on mythology."
2,Not very mythological,"I was looking for a book on mythology, not a book on dogs. While there were one or two interesting myths, primarily this was a book of anecdotes. The fact that it has a chapter for each breed should have been a giveaway...I suppose if you're a dog lover, you won't be as disappointed as I was."
2,Wrong color.,"Beware. Although this dispenser looks silver in the photo, it is actually white. Not what I wanted at all.On the plus side, it works and is sturdy. I just wish it was the right color."
5,An Interesting and Informative Read,"I think this was a great book, a quick read and an interesting perspective of life in Jerusalem. I think people will thoroughly enjoy this. It's a new book, the author's work is highly readable, and I give it a thumb's up."
1,Found this @ the Dollar Tree store.,I found this to be funny that amazon.com is trying to sell this for around $4.00 bucks because i found this on Blu-ray at the Dollar Tree store.
3,A real shocker,"This film spent about a week in the theatres and tanked with the critics. Out of curiosity, just to see exactly how bad it was, I watched it on television. Citizen Kain it ain't, but I ended up really enjoying it! Woody Allen and Bette Midler had terrific chemistry and were quite sexy together (!?). I can't wait to post this so that I can have a look at other reviews to see if I'm out of my mind and am the only one that liked it. (Typically, in order not to be influenced, I won't look at other reviews until I post.)"
5,DVD's ASAP,This DVD purchase was shipped to me so quickly I was not expecting such an immediate response. Very pleasing.
1,Don't even bother,"I didn't realize that Woody Allen did not direct this film until after I watched it. This explains much of my confusion. Depressing, monotonous, painful to watch. This film does nothing but depress the viewer. The early 90's fashions and musical bits did not help make this a ""timeless"" film either. The annoying ""carolers"" throughout the film.....on and on. The one redeaming feature was the reference to ""Salaam Bombay"". My wife was ready to shut it off but I had to see how it ended......oh well, no surprise. We all have to live with ""dukkha"" but this just rubs it in your face. It's an irritating film."
2,Bette and Woody?,Bette Midler and Woody Allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing. Instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as Bette and Woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school. They also discover that they have been cheating on one another. The movie gets boring rather fast as Bette and Woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters. I would have expected better from these two.
3,The title says it all!,"This film is about a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary at a Los Angeles shopping mall. The celebration is bittersweet because the husband(Woody Allen) admits his affair to his wife(Bette Midler). The wife remains angry for a while but eventually forgives her husband. Allen and Midler have done better films than this. Midler's much better films include DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS,RUTHLESS PEOPLE and BIG BUSINESS(all made by Buena Vista like this one). Allen's subsequent film MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY from 1993 was much better than this."
5,Loved it!,"This is one of my all time favorite Woody Allen movies. But I think it's the kind of movie you will either love or hate - nothing in between! I am a big Woody Allen fan, but do not like a lot of his movies, so considering how picky I am, that says a lot. My favorite movies of his have been Play It Again Sam, Annie Hall, Manhattan, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Zelig, New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and probably a few others I forgot. Least favorite (many!) but the worst ever was Curse of the Jade Scorpion... Anyway, if you like ""Jewish-ness"" you will like this film, I think it's a real sleeper!"
3,Best appreciated by Woody Allen and/or Bette Middler fans,"I'm a Woody Allen fan. I've seen most of his movies and have enjoyed most (but not all) of them. I found this movie amusing but falling a bit short of his better work. His character in this movie, in my opinion, does not engage the sympathy of the viewer at the same level as characters he has successfully created in the past. This is not to say he doesn't do a good job with it, it's just to say he didn't ""reach"" me in this character as he has previously.Bette Midler was absolutely perfect in the role of his all-too-human, far-less-than-perfect wife. (I'm not necessarily a Midler fan, but kudos to her in this role. Great job, Bette.)Still, I would certainly recommend this film for the purpose of killing a couple of hours of otherwise available time. It's not going to educate or elevate you, it will not ask you to re-evaluate your life, but you will chuckle . . . and, sometimes, that's quite enough. It's a pleasantly diverting bit of fluff."
1,AVOID AT ALL COST,"I paid 29 cents for this film (used) and I feel completely ripped off. This one is horrendous...horrible acting...no script...totally boring...moves at a snail's pace...and should be avoided at all cost. The box cover art is also a rip-off. There's no such scene in the film. Tracy Nelson's performance is less than inspiring. She's in the wrong field. She should be a clerk at the DMV. Even if someone gives you this film free of charge, refuse it. You could do much better watching TV commercials for 93 minutes. No kidding. This one belongs in the trash...which is where I placed it less than 30 seconds after I retrieved it from my DVD player."
4,Every Sox Fan Should Own This,"I DVR'd this when it broadcast, and have watched it a couple of times. I am eagerly ordering it so that I can have it forever. I watched it with my 11 year old son, who remembers that season but was too young to appreciate the magic of those games. Mercifully, he is also too young to know the angst of being a Sox fan prior to 2004. It is not a painstaking play by play documentary of the whole series. Instead, it focuses on the signature moments: Dave Roberts steal, the Bloody Sock, ARod slapping the ball out of Aroyyo's glove, etc. It does a great job a capturing the emotion of the times. As others had said, I could have done less with Simmons and Clarke, although I think they do add something to it. Overall, it does a splendid job of showing the 4 days that changed Red Sox Nation forever. And yes, watching Yankee fans cry does make for great TV!"
4,"Great doc, could be better","Couldn't agree more with everyone else's sentiments here regarding the two buffoons in the bar. Those cutscenes are AWFUL. Not to mention the perfectly poured glasses of beer on the counter and Lenny Clarke's HIDEOUS outfit.That being said, every Red Sox fan should see this. It fills a need to document what was simply one of the greatest sports dramas ever witnessed.If I had my druthers, I'd kind of like to see something spanning the whole 7 games. I think it would set the stage a bit better overall.And you know what else-why doesn't Damon's grand slam in game 7 get more play? That was the single greatest moment for me. Game 7 was a bit anti-climactic, but you didn't know that in the 2nd inning. Does anyone remember that the Yanks brought in a new pitcher and Damon hit the FIRST PITCH out? Sweet, sweet justice that was."
2,Best series ever. Maybe not the best documentary.,"I love the Red Sox. I'll talk about this series for the rest of my life. With that said, I was disappointed with the documentary. My chief complaint is the lack of continuity between shots. I found it distracting, and I think it detracts from the pure emotion and beauty of these games (e.g. Ortiz's game-winning RBI in game 5). There are many things to like about the documenary, such as the behind-the-scenes footage, the interviews, and the composition of video and sound. But utlimately I wish there had been less cutting and splicing and more rolling with the game footage that many of us remember from our living rooms during these remarkable 4 days."
1,Disappointing,"It may be a great story, but this is a very disappointing documentary. There is no summary of what happened before these 4 games, and not even a mention of the big drumming Boston took in game 3. It doesn't even do a good job of summarizing these 4 games. It's largely just a bunch of nearly-random 5 second clips strung back to back (highlights from local news casts, fan comments, very short clips from the games, clubhouse interviews, etc). It may be OK if you know everything that happened, have ADD, and are taking LSD and looking for something to trip on, but it is in no way a cogent documentary."
3,bullseye - quote from an earlier review,"""two of the biggest buffoons in Red Sox Nation...Bill Simmons and Lenny Clarke sitting in an empty bar. Their lame smart-***** attempts at comedy fell flat and really distracted from the dramatic nature of the the story and the film.""wow. what a shame the producer felt compelled to spend valuable air-time on these two goof-heads' drivel. when i get the dvd, i'll try to figger out a way to effectively liberate the film from them."
4,Better packaging needed,"Got this as one of my son's birthday presnts (he's 6) and he loved all the pieces. I thougth all the pieces looked great, very life like and sturdy. My only complaint on the item is the ""toob"".... for the money paid for such tiny toys, I expected the tube to be much more sturdy. At the very least I had thought it would also be a storage place for the small toys after playtime was over but it wasn't. The ""Toob"" is very flimsy, and once you get the nifty globe top off, you can't put it back on securely, it just falls apart....really annoying that my kids can't carry these items along with them like I had hoped due to the crappy packaging."
3,A review,"Warning! This might be a wonderful book except for the fact that the publishers decided to use much smaller print than is normally used for computer manuals. If staring at small print is not a problem for you then buy this book, otherwise you might be better off buying another book with normal sized print."
2,Buy another version,"I have several recordings of Show Boat, and as much as I like the movie version, this is by far the weakest recording of them all. This should actually be called highlights from Show Boat as the score is mercilessly cut. Most problematic is the really poor (in some cases terrible) sound. In their attempt to rerecord the music in stereo the sound has become muffled with no dynamic range at all. The stereo effects are just wishful thinking. My old Metro LP sounds better. Even Ava Gardner's excellent tracks can't save this one. I like most of the Rhino soundtracks, but you can skip this one."
3,Got what I paid for,"The quality was merely OK, but it was inexpensive so I guess I got what I paid for."
2,What the?,"This is quite the oddest recording quality for a major C.D. release I've ever heard. The film was a mess but a big hit nevertheless. Isolated from the movie, the soundtrack reveals the truly lush qualities and sterling artistry in the performances. Conrad Salinger's arrangements, per usual, are amazing and unmatched. The talent represents as assemblage of peerless artists. So why is the sound here so muddy, muddled, off balance and just strange? I don't get it. The original 10-inch M-G-M L.P. sounded better! Annette Warren is a remarkable singer, but Ava Gardner's vocals are also tremendously moving. The lady who should have gotten the part of Julie is Lena Horne but the powers at M-G-M were too chicken to cast her. Still, her good friend Gardner is devastating in the role. Worth having, worth hearing, worth complaining about."
2,Wrong Dimensions,"The drawers are NOT 12 1/4"" big and therefore you can't fit 12"" x 12"" paper in them. I called and they stated that was the outside measurement of the outside of the drawer--wrong again, they are only 11 1/2"" wide on the outside. So beware if you want to use this for scrapbooking paper.Also, even though the unit was wrapped in bubble wrap, it was broken when it arrived. Very disappointing!"
2,Why no dimensions on the drawers?,"I wanted a holder for 12 x 12 paper. but it didn't fit. What a disappointment! I would have returned, but it costs to much to send. Into the garage!"
3,Picture is decieving,"This is great cart if you want 6 drawers all the same size. The drawers are all ~2 1/2"" deep so the cart can't be used for files only storaged of office supplies.When I looked at the photo I had thought The bottom drawer could be used for files so I was disappointed.It is strudy looks nice and was easy to assemble."
3,much smaller than expected,"was looking for drawers for my wife quilting material. Turns out the drawers are deep, but very short in height.I would recommend to others if you are into crafts."
5,Storage System,This storage system fits my needs perfectly: it holds my piano music in an organized fashion and fits under the piano.
4,Storage Drawers,"These were easy to put together and will work great for my sample's storage. My only concern is that overtime the drawers will bow, but for now they are perfect."
1,Purchased for a Writing Course,"I purchased this book because it was required reading for an adult nonfiction writing course. I enjoy reading, but did not enjoy reading this book and can not recommend it."
1,It doesn't work,"This winder doesn't adequately wind my antique Longines 5-star Admiral. It only runs about 8 seconds on each cycle. I used it exactly the way the instructions said to use it, but my watch requires a bit more winding than that. I tried to give it no stars but apparently at least one is required."
1,Does not work with large Omega watches,"I hate to give this thing a little bit of a bashing, since it is a nice looking winder that is well made and may work with some other automatic watches, but I have a large Omega Seamaster, which fits into the winder just fine with the cusion but fails to actually wind the watch as it turns. The watch does turn in the mechanism, but the winding never happens, which is quite unfortunate."
2,Unfortunately I had to return...,"I had previously purchased this unit for less than $100 - it appears price has gone up significantly. I bought this hoping to be able to use it for my Hamilton X-Wind automatic - unfortunately, I had to return it. The unit itself is pretty handsome, however, workmanship of the leather just seemed okay. There was a minor scratch in the leather edging that was covered by the hinged cover. The primary reason that I returned it however is because the unit I received appeared to be defective - the motor would not operate when I installed a fresh set of batteries. It worked fine with the supplied AC adapter... and ran pretty quiet with this power source. I wanted to have the option to use batteries for when I traveled. I opted to return the unit as opposed to trying to get it replaced."
1,Good price but doesn't work,"This item totally fails to keep my watches running. I have three automatic watches, it fails to keep any of them running. Actually on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this a 0."
1,Don't Even Buy It For Laughs,If you're looking for any practical information don't waste your money. As a comedy it still is a waste of money.
4,Adorable!,"Bought this to fill with snacks for my first year hosting Christmas for the husband's family. Great quality, crisp design, not cheap looking, easy to wash. A+, will be purchasing products from this company again."
5,Plan B is NOW in effect.,"After too long a wait, PLAN B has finally been published. My friends in the Liaden Universe were every bit as great as I remembered them and the trouble Clan Korval gets into every bit as dangerous. Val Con, Miri, Shan, Edger, and all the rest of an exciting cast of characters make this book impossible to put down. The Luck of Clan Korval leads to some interesting plot twists. I can't wait for the next book, I DARE."
5,A rip-roaring adventure,"I knew this was a good book before I read it. How? Because my husband made off with it, and read it in virtually one sitting. This was fortunate, as I wouldn't have been willing to wait very long to get my hands on it. It's a non-stop romp, with plenty of adventure, lots of chuckles, and a lot of hair-raising moments. Val Con and Miri are in trouble, and so is the rest of Clan Korval. As usual they deal with trouble in adept, surprising, and often amusing ways, confounding both friends and enemies along the way. More is seen of Anthora and Nova than in previous books, and some more is learned of the Yxtrang - who have been largely a cipher up until now. If you haven't run into this series before you need to start with Partners in Necessity, which is an omnibus of the first three Liaden novels. Just be warned, once you start you won't stop until you've read everything available."
1,Standard size was really adult small,"Wouldn't fit. Have to be under 5'5"" for it to fit. Haed doesn't stay on well. Can't make any sudden moves or the eyes shift and you are blind."
2,poor,"When we received the item, we found that the vercro closure had only loops and could not be closed. Fortunately, I could sew and fixed the problem. I do not think that you should have to pay that amount and have to repair the costume in any way. We did not have time to return the item or I would have..I am not sure that I will order from you again...Sincerely,Christie Fowler"
1,not that great,I'm 6'3 and was too small for me. The pants part was too tight in the waist and when I put on the mask it was pretty smelly. I first decide to go with this one because it was cheaper but it doesn't look anything like the actual Chewbacca so I couldn't get my money back because I order in October. so I won't be ordering it again
5,A great brainstorming starter,"Grab this book before planning your reunion to help through the stumbling blocks and unlock a wealth of creative event combinations. I=m sure this book will be as useful to the first time reunion planner as it will be to the pros for new ideas and creative ways to let your reunion celebration unfold. The deck gives you ideas for inventive places to hold your reunion, themes to add some excitement, food and beverage styles that you may not have tried before, elements to enhance a single event and things to bring some excitement to the reunion overall. Mix and match each idea until you come up with the reunion that=s perfect for your group. Before you start to plan your reunion, buy this book. It will help bring out the natural creativity in your group."
4,Overall movie impression,"For GI Joe the movie, I thought it was good after watching the movie despite of what some friends say that it was only so-so. I would recommend it to those people who like action to see the movie. I just can't wait for the sequel to come out because I know it will be highly anticipated."
5,Love It!,"I love this movie! There have been a lot of classic cartoons & whatnot getting live action movie treatment these days, but the GI Joe is one of my favorites of them. I went to the theater when this was out and saw it as a double feature alongside District 9 (which I hadn't originally planned to see but a friend had said it was good so I thought I'd see it too).The acting was pretty good and the action was pretty awesome. LoL, it was funny seeing Christopher Eccleston in it after having seen him in Doctor Who. It was cool to see the writer and director's ideas behind the start of everything and Cobra's eventual rise to commander of the enemy terrorist group.Originally I owned the DVD copy because I didn't quite have Blu-Ray capability when it had first come out, but not long after I had one I upgraded this to Blu-Ray. Looking forward to seeing the sequel!"
3,it was alright,"wasnt what i was hoping for in terms of a GI Joe movie, hopfully the second one is better than the first"
4,Fun action flick,"GI Joe is a fun action movie I like to watch over & over so glad I bought it. Channing Tatum is very believable as a solider (though his sidekick is not; more of a doofus and not believable as a special ops/superior fighter pilot). Enjoyed the fast-paced action sequences, excitement, love interest/romance with a twist, the gray of some characters not being all black or white (not just good & evil), etc., etc. I grew up watching ""GI Joe...American hero"" (can still sing the cartoon song) so really enjoyed seeing this in the theater, and it does not disappoint on DVD either. I've already watched it twice. Also, really love the back stories that give the characters depth and demonstrate their childhoods/motivations/past; gives this movie more than the typical action flick with two-dimensional characters."
5,Why all the hate?,"I don't know why so many people are hating on this movie. Okay, so its not the best story, or acting. But it is still good. The story in my opinion has more depth than the Transformers Revenge of the Fallen story. This movie is just a fun movie, and is a bit corny at times. But it is still a good, fun movie. If your a fan of action movies, then you will probably like this movie. So give it a chance."
5,Smooth transaction,"Bought the G.I. Joe Blu-Ray. The shipping was fast, the item as described, great seller, would highly recommend."
2,Def Only a 2 Star Movie,"I love action flicks and was really, really looking forward to this movie. Very close to being a total dud, but I admit it just kept my interest enough to finish watching it. To add insult to injury, even Dennis Quaid was more a cameo role and phoned it in, and Sienna Miller was horribly miscast in it :("
5,Awesome!,Loved the movie! Long time fans of the franchise should be happy because this is clearly a set up for future installments!!!
1,"Not a Great Movie, Inappropriate for Family or Children","Only a complete, brain-dead moron would call this a family film. The deadly carnage begins within the first few minutes and continues nonstop for the entire film. Maybe all those civilians and cars they destroyed during the Drive through Paris were full of escape murders and child molesters so they deserved what they got. Just because it is all computer generated doesn't make it family fun. It's still just bad movie making. I feel diseased just for watching it and am ashamed of myself for even renting it. The acting was totally hideous. The only good thing I can say about this movie is it had great special effects. Unfortunately, most movies today, good or bad, can make that claim. Stay away from this film."
1,Poor for anyone over 13,"I rarely review movies, but this one was so disappointing I had to put a quick review. I grew up watching GI Joe, and playing with the action figures as a kid. This was so bad I didn't even finish the whole thing, instead fast forwarding through much of it. There were so many characters it was confusing, to the point I never really cared about any of them.This reminds me what happened to the Batman Movies in the 90's. They were so crappy for so long that when Batman Begins came out everyone was so shocked it was actually good. I think there is a good GI Joe movie out there waiting to be made by a good director with a good story but this one certainly was not it.Granted this was probably aimed at teenagers and the newer Batman movies aimed at adults but this was so bad I had to warn others to not waste their time."
2,"Entertaining, but NOT G.I. JOE.","This movie had gunfights, explosions, cool vehicles and pretty much everything an action junkie likes. Problem is, they took a mediocre ""B"" action movie and slapped the G.I. JOE name on it. This was NOT the G.I. JOE I grew up with. And what's with the leather jumpsuits? Does EVERY action movie hero have to sport a leather jumpsuit now? First X-MEN now G.I. JOE. Only The Baroness should have been in a leather jumpsuit, and she was, so the movie wasn't all bad. Bottom line, it's a good way to kill two hours on a saturday afternoon, when it comes on cable."
2,"Big guns, corny guns, and hot babes","I can't say I had high expectations for any movie based on GI Joe action figures. I used to love playing the figures as a kid, but it just simply isn't movie material.G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobrais probably the best they could do given the concept, but the result isn't very satisfying. It's an action movie galore, but not much else. The script gets a bit corny and cliche, with predictable lines and plot developments - like the hot GI Joe Scarlett also being the scientific nerd. I was also surprisedG.I. Joefeatures so many hot characters. I don't remember anybody like Sienna Miller's character in my action figures when I was younger! Unfortunately, it seems part of a larger problem with the movie - it is more focused on delivering eye candy (both special effects and hot actresses) than delivering a good movie."
2,"Really cheesy, really long, really violent","Really cheesy, really long, one minute doesn't go by without yet another battle sequence, lots of sci-fi high tech, low on everything else. The cartoon was better, at least then you got what you expected."
1,Beyond unwatchable,"I may be biased because I'm not a big fan of action movies as it is, but this is about as bad an ""action"" movie there is. I figured it may be something to watch while I work out, but it wasn't even able to keep my attention partially during sets. Furthermore all the shooting is so badly directed it just gives you a headache. Amazon, please add a minus-rating as this would be a -5"
1,Pathetic movie,"This movie was like a bad dream where you know everything is stupid and wrong but you can't wake up. Nobody was real, no one's behavior made sense, and at the end you felt that time was wasted completely."
1,"Horrible, horrible movie","There isn't a single positive note in this picture. Every actor is horrible, the script is pointless, and the directing is the most amateurish I've ever seen in a mainstream action/adventure film. To top it off, the PG-13 rating is wildly inappropriate; the violence in this film is clearly deserving of an R, but no one uses the f-word, so of course the MPAA rewarded it."
3,G. I. Don't know,"First let me say my buying experience with Amazon was great as always. Pirce was good and delivery was as expected. Why anyone would buy DVDs or Blurays anywhere else is is a mystery.The movie...well that was disappointing. There was the expected action and so on but, the movie had a ""toy"" quality to it. I think it was more the story line than the production values. Ublike the Marval comic movies G I Joe was after all just a toy with no story to be told."
1,terrible,I recently saw this movie and its terrible. One of the worst I have seen ever. Dont waste your money on the dvd or blu-ray. If you dont believe me - rent it and then decide for yourself.
1,irritated,i liked the movie hence why i tried to buy it...i bought it in the beginning of February and it is now May...i STILL have not gotten my movie
3,"movie was great, ""the product"" blew","the film skipped constantly,I will give the product another try but this is not en easy way to watch a movie."
5,The Joes,just a fun movie to watch. I didn't expect a lot when I purchased the movie but it was a fun watch. Don't take it too seriously. It is full of fun and action.
5,It's a movie based on action figures...,You just have to love it for what it is. Enjoy the action and don't get too preoccupied with reality.
3,Should have just been called JOE,I thought G.I. Joe was the american hero. This movie was alright. But I wish it was just a american force. I don't remember G.I. Joes being a international force. They should have just called the movie Joe and left the G.I. off of the title. But other than that I liked the movie
1,Bleah!,"Poor me, poor me. I suffered so much watching this movie to the end. Two hours long, que horror!!! This is the most horrific movie I have ever seen. It is boring as hell. I was browsing through the movies and figured this one would be exciting. I really do not care about the acting, but I was expecting the action to excite. It did nothing for me. The CGI wasn't very impressive either. It looked very unrealistic. You could tell it was CGI. Geesh! Wait until your library has it and check it out free of charge. Through out the whole thing I had been wishing it to end and wish I had been watching something else. It reminds me of an 80's sci fi movie the kind you laugh at now in the present.....generic and cheesy. Bleah!"
4,Funtastic!,"WOW! One of the best all round movies I've seen in some time. A great melding of action, imagination and super effects. If you like sci fi, comics or the military at all you gotta see this one."
2,"GI Joe: Rise of ""What Just Happened""","GI Joe wow what's to say? Well if you liked the corny cartoon you will love the movie (I hope), because the movie is probably a little more corny than the cartoon. So basically I sat down thinking wow this is gonna either be amazing and the worst movie ever made. It was AMAZING.Since no one likes to read extensive reviews on movies they haven't seen I will just trick everyone into actually giving it a chance.I am just gonna hit a few key points one should know before seeing.Jet pack flying into a spaceship thing.Ninja fights.Flashbacks of a long lost love.A submarine dog fight.Laser or plasma guns(not sure).Workout/training sequence.Threat of nanobot world holocaust.The line ""We lost a lot of Joes out there today.Garbage CG mixed with some of the coolest CG of a ninja dodging flying cars.Snake Eyes is still the most legit mofo in ninja history."
2,GI Joe - Way too far fetched...,"Movie: (would rate as 2 stars)I know it's supposed to be sci-fi, but there should be at least some level of reality to it... Way to far-fetched for my liking.Service: (would rate as 3 stars)Watched this on a Roku box via Amazon Video On Demand - quality was 'OK', but nothing near BluRay HD."
1,Easily one of the worst big budget movies of the 21st Century,"I have been sitting here, looking at a blank page for several minutes. I don't even know where to begin with this absolute horror show of a movie. I tried to think of ONE good thing about it, and there's literally nothing. It is the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen with a huge budget behind it. It undoubtedly has to be one of the worst movies of all time, with a budget of over $100 million. And for this movie to have done over $300 million at the Box Office is a SIN! Talk about robbing people. This had little to no entertainment value, the acting was horrible, script was even worse, special effects were comical looking, character development was poor. It wasn't funny, wasn't interesting. I mean, this had NOTHING.If you can add something negative to this review, please, by all means, do so! Lol."
1,Worst Movie Ever!!,The G.I Joe: Resolute movie was 20 times better than this poorly written crap they called a movie.If your gonna spend the money buy that instead of this poo.
2,This is not an Amercian Hero,"Almost three out of five stars for me. Great action and a whole lot of fun to watch. The Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow thing was cool, using very talented martial artists. I loved this cartoon as a kid and became very patriotic over the whole thing as a child. Having served in Iraq and watching this movie seeing the GI Joe All American Hero thing downplayed in this movie was a slap in the face. Certain things were just awkard and didn't translate from the comics and TV show very well, Tatum looked like Duke but seemed 10 years too young for Duke's rank which I think was First Seargent or something, and his acting sucks. The exo suit things were a bit much but the Army is testing stuff like that so I guess that can slide. And the Black Eyed Peas song at the end credits left me with a bad taste in the mouth and made for a bad joke like the Moroccan Special Forces guy."
1,REAL AMERICAN HERO............NOT ANYMORE!!!!,"Remember the GIJOE you loved in your youth? A real American hero? Forget it! What used to be patriotic is now pathetic. The new international heroes will save us all (yawn)! This movie is only loosely based on the GIJOE I remember, and if you are a hardcore old school fan like I am you will not like this. Transformers was at least true to its roots fun and entertaining. I wouldent waste the time or money on this movie. Bottom line DISSAPOINTING!"
1,NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies of ALL time. Do NOT spend money on this drivel, if anything call up the idiots in Hollywood and demand them to pay you for wasting more than a second of your life on this. AND ALSO - since when is Government Issue Joe an international force, ""GI Joe ... the AMERICAN HERO""??"
1,where's the beef?,"Why is it that almost ALL movies reviewed on Amazon have 4 or more stars? It seems there are really NO bad movies based on the ratings. well, here's one bad review!Take away the CG that's overused and unimaginative and you're left with bad acting, bad story, just plain BAD! Can anyone tell me what purpose Dennis Quaid served in this movie? I used to watch GI Joe cartoon movie on VHS with my kids years ago and I gotta say that movie was FAR SUPERIOR. Basically another example of easy special effects destroying art of film making and Hollywood chasing easy money with fat, dumb, and happy audiences who will see these types of movies no matter how bad the story is. I feel ripped off spending $1 renting this."
2,Disappointed long time fan,"I grew up reading the Joe comic book. Snake eyes inspired me to train in martial arts. If they would have made this a straight war movie and allowed Ray Park to show case his actual martial arts skills this could have been one of the best comic book movies ever. The special effects and all of the fake stuff ruined this movie for me. Ray Park has extreme skills that would have been better than the computer generated stuff and wire work. It really confuses me how they can make a ""live action"" movie faker than a comic book."
3,Could have bin better,I went to go see this movie with my dad and it bad and good at the same time C.G.I The Rise Of Cobra is ok not the best I hate movies with so much cgi in it and this is one of them.
1,GI NO-GO,"The biggest problem with this movie is its disregard with the fact that GIJOE is supposed to be fiercely American, thus the phrase ""a real American Hero."" This movie makes them out to be some sort of United Nations group. I don't recall seeing one American flag in the movie, now granted I didn't pay too much attention after the first 20 minutes revealed the angle they were taking. The characters are all a bunch of paper-thin talking-head blow-hards with extremely bad dialogue. I have been waiting for a live action GIJOE since I was 10 years old. Alas, upon seeing the ads for this movie I knew then that I would have to wait another 10-15 years for Hollywood to re-load the franchise because this one was a blank."
3,GI Joe : The rise of Cobra,The Movie play on my Mom's PC and new DVD player but it did not work on my PS2 and it play funny on my living room DVD player.
5,G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra,this particular DVD was a gift for my younger brother so I honestly can't review this but my brother was very happy and he loved the movie
3,It is what it is,"I get frustrated when people bash this movie. It's by no means great, but let's be honest, you don't exactly look to G.I. Joe for highbrow, thought provoking social discourse. You watch it because it's fun. This is an enjoyable action/adventure movie. The acting is okay, but it's got a lot of explosions and action sequences so sit back and watch. Turn the brain off for an evening and just enjoy the show."
3,Fun popcorn movie,"Nothing real spectacular here. Just a fun movie with better then average special effects. This movie reminds me of the Roger Moore Bond movies. Yes on one level they were bad, but entertaining nevertheless."
3,action flick? Fair. capturing G.I.Joe? Meh.,"I think the overall reviews of G.I.Joe are just about fair. As an action movie it's about what you'd expect. It's not great, but it's entertaining and there are lots of special effects, gunfights, and explosions. Where the movie falls short is in depicting the classic characters or in capturing the feel of the old tv show or comic book series. I think the last part was something that was important in making this a successful series of movies, and they messed it up. The gross was great on the first movie because long time fans were giving it a try. I don't think many of them will be returning to the theater for a sequel. Scarlett-Ripcord??? Why? Why not Scarlett-Snake Eyes like in the comics, or Scarlett-Duke like in the cartoon? Going with Ripcord makes no sense. How is it better? There are a lot of things like that that take away from the movie. But ignoring all the history, it's a 3-star action movie."
4,Loved Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow,"I loved the actors whom played Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, they got their characters down to a 'T'!The rest of the movie however, so-so, the story line could use a bit of tweaking."
3,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,Entertaining. Everything you've come to expect from a Hollywood rendition of a comic book. Decent special effects.
3,"G.I. Joe - Great Special Effects, Poor Character Development","I recently purchased G.I.Joe, which I had not seen in the theatre. I thought it would be a good story. However, all it is one thing getting blown up after another. Lots of shooting, very little character development. The special effects overwhelm the movie. After you've seen half an hour of things exploding, you've got the idea and the rest is a collossal bore."
2,Wow Special Effects are COOL! Story? What Story?,"Sad what they did, all the budget and computing power you could want, and this is the film that gets made. Not the Casts fault, just a painfully shallow plot, stilted dialog, blech. Felt like a Star Wars prequel, just horribly done.Disappointed."
5,GIJoe geat movie,That movie is really amaizing. Visual effects and audio the best... watch it folks..
4,Action,"This movie is full of action. Sometimes you can have a little too much action, but very good."
1,Horrible,i saw this movie and has to be the worse movie i ever seen.it was so bad that i did not even finish watching it.Don't waste your money on this movie.
3,Kind of Laughable But a Little Fun,"Okay..the acting was terrible. Especially the lead character who seemed to clench his jaws every time he was in a scene.The special effects, which I think they had to many for the producers to manage, were almost laughable at times. Have to say thatsome of the visual were stunning though. Transformers 2 knocked this one out of the park."
1,Terrible Film,"Gave me a vision of what Power Rangers would have been like on crack. Terrible film, poor acting, decent action, poor writing, and the visual effects in many places make Jurassic Park look state of the art."
1,The most expensive B movie ever!,"The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and I was wish with all the destruction in the movie the entire cast of characters would blow each other apart. The special effects contradict themselves by being really good and really bad. The acting on the other hand is constant in it's blandness. Skip this movie, and if you watch it and love it, don't tell anyone so they don't think you're 5.You know there's a sequel coming so hey ""Hollywood people"", please fire the director and the rest of the cast and get some real talent in there."
4,Longtime Gi Joe fan,"I saw the trailer of the movie and thought it might be lame ,but if you have a open mind and go into it trying to have fun then you will. If you like the GI JOE franchise then you wont be disappointed. If your just a sci fi/ action fan then you'll like the movie if your ok with something like a assault on a moon base or something."
3,decent movie,This movie is just what I expected. It was entertaining with great action sequences and bad acting. Snakes eyes was a great character but Duke & Ripcord just did not do it for me. I thought the two main soldiers in both Transformers were much better. The storyline was totally predictable too. This movie falls short when you compare it to the 1st transformers. This movie is worth a rental but not a purchase
3,Decent,"Decent Movie. seems like the actors have never acted before. Also seems too slow and ju bled of a movie story, thats supposed to be based off the cartoon. If not for the action scenes, this could have went straight to DVD/bluray. Do movies go straight to Bluray or am I over stepping my bounds? Anyway, better as a rent than a buy."
1,We left!,"My dad and I saw this in the Dollar theater and at the half point of the movie,we left.Too much mindless action,no story,this should be on TV!I mean,who in the world would give this movie 5 stars?!Even if my life depended it,I WILL NOT BUY OR RENT THIS FILM!"
1,Bad. No; Awful.,"Seriously.I guess that the Baroness was good-looking, so the movie wasn't all bad. But it was close. All of the characters were ruined, the ""real American Hero"" is now less American, the dialogue was horrible, and the comic relief was painful. It's really as bad as people say it is.Maybe the pacing was okay? Until toward the end, when it kept going...If you like scary movies, then you'll like the end, when they strongly suggest a sequel."
4,GOOD ACTION PACT MOVIE,i grew up on the GI JOE cartoon series back in the 1980s and i loved this film. going to buy the dvd for my own collection. heart pulse pounding action and fighting thru out. i rented it on netflix but i have to buy one!
4,Yo Joe,Sure it could have been better. What movie couldn't be? Where they really went wrong was those space-aged suits that were just too futuristic for my liking. The Storm Shadow/ Snake Eyes conflict was amazing and I can't wait for Storm Shadow to have his revenge. Where was Snake Eyes' dog? The baroness is a goddess and I hope to see more of her in an evil role again. This movie really sets things up for the next one when (SPOILER) Cobra Commander takes control of Cobra and delivers the pain. GI Joe is action packed.
3,Fun action flick,I would watch it again. Not the best plot ever but fun action in it. I liked the special effects.
4,G.I. Joe for the new generation,"I grew up with G.I Joe on T.V and the toys my brothers had laying all over. I am somewhat familiar with the characters, not much about their background in the series. It's awesome that they finally made a movie that was action pack and had alot going on. I did however get confused by the Zartan character and was disappointed to see Cobra Commander put to shame like he was. However, this movie for the new generation,(who hasn't seen the original series) will be awe at the special effects and cool gadgets. I would recommend buying this movie for movie collectors, but for the Die hard Joe fans I am sure they we're disappointed."
1,Duke can't act.,This movie sucked. The red haired girl was hot. The guy that played Duke cannot act. Just not a good movie. Dennis Quaid even sucked. Sieanna Miller sucked too. The two good thing: looking at the red head & the suprise guest appearance by SPOILER BELOWGEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.Suck suck sucked.
1,Worst Action Movie Ever!,"Worst Action Movie for the summer of 2009, if you think that this movie goes with the G. I. Joe cartoon and Comic books of the 80's. You are dead wrong, nothing like it at all. Just don't waste your time and money on this movie."
1,Not enough Ray Park...,"Liked it that he didn't say a word and did a lot of chop-socky.Other than that, this movie was awful. Love the fact that even though Parks' character Shadow (I think that's the characters' name) didn't have much air time, he's larger than the rest of the gang on the cover. This of course shows you that the company knew that my assessment of the show was correct and are hoping that the audience who Did Not see the movie in the theater will buy this because they see a 'sorta' ninja on the cover and think that he's the actual Star of the movie!They're making a movie on silly games like 'Astroid' and 'Battleship' which shows you how desperate hollyweird is nowadays. 'GI joe' is on that weird coin too."
1,GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra,This item was shown in stock when ordered. It didn't arrive. I did receive a notice that it wasn't available and did receive a credit in a timely manner. Would order from this company again.
2,Lame Graphics,"The movie started fine but the middle was so cheesey and lame that I actually got up from watching it with my kids to go cook dinner. So I did not review the end. The main character might be a heartthrob to young females, and I am not hating on the guy but he cannot act. He did fine in Coach Carter but this movie sucked and he did not help matters by starring in this crap. I'm suprised at Dennis Quaid. He is a fine actor that has been in alot of good movies but lately he's been in a slump. 1st the horror flick Horseman, now this crap. I'm sorry this movie was good for children between the ages 7 and 11. Thats it."
2,Nothing Special,"No one is expecting much out of a film like this, you go and watch it for some actions scenes and hot girls in skin tight costumes trying to be [...]. That's fine I get that. Problem is GI Joe is just trying way too hard to be cool, the action scenes are far too over the top and require CGI for almost every single second of them, and you start to wonder why they just didn't render the whole film like it and save a lot of money. Even the dialog comes across as forced, you can tell that the actors are cringing on the inside with each syllable of nonsense they must mutter, even down to squeezing in some of the catch phrases such as ""knowing is half the battle"", ""GO Joe!"" and ""Real American hero"".If I didn't know any better I would say that this is a live action Team America, finish watching the Paris scene and tell me I'm wrong, I dare you.At the end of the day the movie does do what is set out to do. A minor distraction that is forgotten quickly, a B-Movie with a budget."
1,SIMPLE!!!,"I'll keep this short and sweet! G.I.Joe: The Rise Of Cobra is a horrible movie!!! Being a huge G.I. Joe fan since I was a kid, I was utterly disgusted with this movie! Being an open-minded critic...I fell asleep 15 mintes into this thing. It was torture! I could go on and on about why this movie is terrible..."
1,"Gee, I hate Joe","Adjective review for GI Joe:Garbage. Trash. Vomit. Effluence. Refuse. Waste. Debris. Rot. Rubble. Waste. Junk. Litter. Flotsam. Swill. Scraps. Offal. Detritus. Dump. Rubbish. Drivel. Twaddle.By no means does this list even begin to describe it. If you ever watched the 80's cartoon, it's as ridiculous and stupid as the cartoon only this time it's live action. Can't wait for the sequel with the generic""Revenge of [ ]"" title."
1,Nice visually - but nothing else here.,"Visually stunning, but that alone is not enough to carry this movie. This is for sure a one-time watch - so rent, don't buy. I think this movie sets the record for number of cheesy lines. Maybe 50% of the dialog is mindless predictable one-liners you've heard 100 times already in other movies. There is no character development to speak of, there are no surprises in the plot. Very tiring to watch this movie in one sitting.I gave it one star only because of the visual treat (and because you can't give it none :) )."
1,How could they?,"It's like having the most amazing memories of childhood ripped from your conscience. Ground-up, from the original writers to the actors and director; all involved in this atrocity should banned from even discussing movies. This review doesn't even scratch the surface of my true feelings. Any person or entity that profited from this plague of a movie should donate every dollar to charity."
4,Entertaining,Worth watching. Good action scenes. Worth the purchase. If you are looking for a movie with action this is it. Looking forward to see the next one.
4,Eh...,"...if u can look past the bad acting and cliche/80s-90s era action movie feel of it, it's actually a pretty entertaining flick. The special effects aren't the greatest during parts of it or nor does the movie give you a traditional G.I. Joe feel but it's watchable. Basically a movie made by Hollywood for the masses and not the original fans."
2,Pre-Teen Shoot-Em-Up Rollercoaster,"This a simple movie - all flash and no substance - just like the cartoon. If you're one of those pre-teens who embraced the animated version in the 80s, you'll probably enjoy this thing, because it shovels out the same formula: beefcakes, big guns, explosions, dumb dialogue, cheesy jingoism, massive property damage, and militarism without consequence. If that's not your thing, run away. Hollywood is cashing in on an old, ugly pop icon."
1,"low budget, crappy, put together in five minutes",What else can I say? This movie SUCKED. SUCKED. SUCKED. But it wasn't bad enough to become good again (like Torque). Save yourself.
3,guilty pleasure popcorn movie..,"I am a fan of this director-Stephen Sommers....""Mummy"", ""Mummy Returns"", ""Van Helsing"". He really knows how to direct an action pic.Based upon, yes, the popular action figure for several generations. This film throws a lot of CGI effects (which are impressive) and good-looking actors on the screen. I enjoyed all the eye candy and the action scenes.the story has something to do with good guys protecting an ultimate weapon from the bad guys; the usual chaos follows.this movie is a nice way to warm up your cold winter days with heavy action.recommended mood to be in when you are about to watch this movie: lethargic. You won't feel lethargic after watching it!fun, energetic film.."
4,"great movie, but really should have put the special features on blu","I really enjoyed the movie, and they did a good job on the blu ray. I thought it was a little annoying that they didn't bother to put the special features on a blu ray, but on a DVD instead. I think this was to avoid having to add a third disc specifically for the digital copy, but it's a little cheesy."
2,Entertaining but also annoying.,"The movie was entertaining with some good action scenes but...The movie was also annoying as some of it was borderline stupid, the choice of some of the actors was inane and some of the action scenes were ludicrous even for this type of movie.With a few minor changes, this could have been a much much better movie. If you like action, comic book, corny type movies and can overlook a lot, then you might like this movie. We sort of enjoyed it (more or less) but won't go out of our way to see it again."
3,decent movie,"Pretty decent movie. It has a so-so plot. The action sequences are pretty cool, but the filler lacks a little."
4,Fun enough movie,"This movie had a bit of a rough start for me. Before all the action starts we get Channing Tatum talking which is really painful. He's tolerable when there is action going on but without that it really exposes just how terrible of an actor he is. And since he's the star of the movie, he becomes a drag. I found just about every other character far more interesting than him. Even the ninja that doesn't speak.The special effects are fun but a little cartoonish. I bought them sometimes. Other times they looked a little poor. But they got the job done.If they make a sequel, I would suggest dumping Channing Tatum."
3,Paramount .... You Idiots,"Why put the special feature on the same disc as the digital copy??? There is enough room on the Blu-ray disc for everything. Now I have to take out disc one (Blu-ray) to watch the the special features on disc two (dvd). The same thing was done with Hellboy II. Movie on the Blu-ray disc & special features on the digital copy disc (which is a dvd). The dvd nowadays aren't handled with care as Blu-ray discs, so most dvd's are scratched or have fingerprints when you take them out of the package.Why not make a real 2 disc edition on two Blu-ray discs (LIKE YOU DID WITH TRANSFORMERS 2) & have the digital copy separate on a dvd that you can get rid of when it cannot be used anymore. Most of these so called 2 disc editions are just a 1 disc edition with a digital copy that can't be used after a certain period or after a couple of downloads.I have to take away stars because of how Paramount handled this release."
1,"Painful, even for an 80's kid.","I just can't recommend enough that you not watch this movie. The plot was barely there and the lines were so sophmoric, I was saying them along with the movie without ever having seen it before. It was bad pun after sexual innuendo that could only possibly be amusing to a 12 year old boy with an equal IQ. I suppose if you just want flashy lights and BFG's, this might entertain you for a moment or two, but honestly, there are a lot better in that genre."
2,Had potential... Wayans kills it,"This is on par with the latest Transformers movie (Rise of the Fallen) in its excessive use of computer graphics for the action scenes. The story wasn't bad, but the casting of Marlon Wayans as Ripcord really REALLY killed it for me. I kept waiting for the next Scary Movie gag to appear. He really tries to act, but is more suited for comedies than anything else. He ended up being a major distraction. Hopefully the next Joe film will replace him with a real actor. The pacing of the film seemed a little off to me as well. All in all, it was watchable... but I had hoped for something with more character development and a cohesive story line. Maybe this was the setup for Joe 2."
3,low grade production,"i don't think the producer or director really knew what they were trying to make, shoot um, kick um, and kill um, thats the movie!"
1,"Oh Ugh, and a sequel too?","While watching this I was so thankful we rented it, and didn't buy it. Not that I expected much from it, the special effects were good, albeit a bit transparent at times, cheesy dialogue, and it just NEVER ENDED.But I learned a lesson: Will never force my hubby to watch another ""chick flick"" as I now understand the sheer torture he endures."
2,Too much going on ...,"... it's just too much going on for me. The plot is okay. But, geeez there are explosions left right and center. It just over the top technical. The story is totally lost in all those ""WOW"" moments. Too much sugar and coffain for me ..."
4,Part 1??? One can only hope so,"I had LOW expectations for this movie. i did ask for and got it for christmas 2009 and waited until today to watch it because i didn' want to be disapointed.I WASN'TThe movie got right into the action. even though it was mostly CGI i didn't care. this was a faily decent movie with a decent plot. could this happen for real? hell no. A terrorist making a dooms day bomb and then going to the UN to ask for more funding? laughable....but it got better from there.Compare this to other 80's cartoons that became live action movies (transformers comes to mind) this should have won an acadamy award. (no i am not saying it really should have, i am saying it was better.if you watched and liked the GI Joe cartoons this will fill an emprty spot. If action and shoot em ups are not your thing, stay away, there is plent ""speghetti sauce"" to go around here"
4,must i always be the first one to write a review...,"Wow, this is a really good album. I can't believe nobody has taken the time to review it. This album will make you feel dark and sinister in a psychodelic and trippy sort of way. ""quiet room-44"" and ""de-orbit burn"" are some of the best space rock out there. the only reason I didn't give it a five was because the three middle tracks are lacking something but i am not exactly sure just what it is. give this album a ride and i promise you will never come down."
2,You could of heard better 25 years ago.,"I tried to like this album, I wanted to like this album, but after listening, and then listening again, I found it to be a bit redundant. Maybe if I was 18 again and smoked my first joint, or dropped a tab, this would have been impressive. It's just that this ""type"" of material has been done so many times better, by so many people, from the sixties all the way to the late eighties. Please explore the many recordings of the superior ""Can"" or even early ""Helios Creed"" before spending your hard earned cash on this. Unless you feel the need to fill more dead space on your CD rack."
2,Bad fangs,"the glue that came with these is useless. I was unable to wear them. Also, I could not talk once they were applied and they promptly fell out. The fangs are still fine and I may try to find a better glue and use them."
2,very boring,I am not inspired by this cd I wish I could return it I dislike it so much I can't even get through the first part
4,Wow! It's a Motorcycle! And a little man!,"This was an 'early' birthday present for my grandson; thus, he was very motivated to open it and start playing. Within seconds of when the words in the title of this review were spoken, he raced off, motorcycle clutched in hand. The two were not to be separated. Since then, he plays with it, designing imaginative stories using other toys which interact with this one. Playmobil is a winner. This is the first Playmobil that I have purchased for him. There will be more to come!"
5,Cool shots from back in the day.,"A neat book with vintage photos of rods & customs, model cars & auto memorabilia."
5,A first-class college textbook,"This is one of the college textbooks which I saved from college and found to be an excellent source of reference for years to come. Combinatorics is the kind of math that every programmer needs to know from time to time, but if you're like me you will be a bit rusty everytime a new problem presents itself. I strongly recommend this book to both students and programmers who have yet to appreciate the value of the factorial function ;)"
2,not impressed,"I am a math grad student taking graph theory this semester. As a math major, I understand that one should have the ability to ""fill in the holes"". You can overdo anything, however. This book is ruined by its lack of examples. Also, it is like the author is in a hurry when he is talking about key ideas. Definitions are often stated in a rushed way that confuses me. Yet, he rambles on when discussing less relevant things. In short, this is a very hard text to read. Easy exercises seem hard because little foundation has been laid. I only paid $17 for this book on amazon. I could not imagine paying $100 for it.I will admit that this book is a good source for exercises. Also, the proofs are fairly readable, provided you can grasp the ""under-explained"" key concepts that are less than readable."
5,Sweet and whimsical,"This is an adorable story that I bought for my nieces and nephew. Ron Atlas has a real gift for telling a tale that will appeal to all young children, and the illustrations are beautiful!"
5,Amazing Bach on Marimba,"I happen to love Bach transcriptions and, like most bach lovers, I can be rather picky...but this recording is amazing. I think Bach would have loved it as well. Highly recommended!"
3,An ambitious project that doesn't quite make it,"Bach on marimba is certainly an idea worth trying, but this album failed to captivate me like ""normal"" music by Bach does, or even as some transcriptions for other instruments such as guitar do. The muisic sounds dry, soulless, with little or none of Bach's warmth and color. It is interesting nonetheless simply as an original interpretation of Bach's music. While uninspired, Merola's playing is clean and precise. He obviously has great technical skill, and his website (www.....com) reveals him as a musician of exceptional vision with a promising future. His future projects should turn out better; this one just wasn't meant to be."
1,Unbelievable...,"...that anybody could take this worth a grain of salt. These ""experiments"" with water crystals do not possess any scientific integrity. There are no repeated trials, proper controls, evaluations of mineral composition, no tests of precision, etc. Emoto even attempts to tie in some incomprehensible point about DNA inheritance. It is plainly evident that he never studied genetics or chemistry, or any proper scientific method. This book cannot be considered scientific or philosophical in nature. Both science and philosophy seek to know the truth. This book is, at best, an exposition of wishful thinking."
1,Intellectual disgrace!!!,"I have a terribly difficult time believing that this kind ofintellectual abomination is being published, printed and sold in thisday and age. The author jumps to ridiculous conclusions without thesupport of any real (i.e. SCIENTIFIC) evidence. This kind of nonsensewould never be published in any decent science journal. Oh and thereis no such thing as ""[a] blend of science and spirituality"". Thesedenote two completely different ways of thinking. The first is logicaland methodical, and seeks evidence to find truth. The second assertsthat science cannot explain everything, and immediately concludes thatwhatever is not presently explained by science is explained byspiritual entities. Of course, spiritualists are entitled to theirown beliefs, but that doesn't mean epilepsy really was themanifestation of demonic possession in the middle ages."
3,More than Water flows in this book,"Thought provoking and definitely outside of the box. This book isn't just about ""water"" but everything that we are: psychologically, socially, physically, spiritually and beyond. This books is another voice in the choir that sentience exists on all levels, and that respect and kindness (and conversely cruelty and disrespect) affects everything small and large, whether we can see it with our naked eyes or not."
5,A MOST IMPORTANT SECRET INDEED!,"I am such a fan of Dr. Emoto and his books!! Never could I have gained such a respect and appreciation for the healing power of water were it not for reading Dr. Emoto's books and actually getting to see the crystal formations he captured on film. I have learned to relate to water in ways I never dreamed possible, and I will respect this entity and NEVER take clean water for granted for the rest of my life. Thank you, Dr. Emoto!"
5,Review of the Secret Life of Water,This is an excellent read...it's interesting beyond measure. The research is incredible and important for everyone. The CD about this subject is an excellent companion to the book. I'm glad I purchased this book.
4,What The??,"Seriously.. WTF?I almost stopped reading it, and then I got hooked. Me thinks the author dropped some acid coming up with this story line. Where or how anyone came up with this is beyond me. It's one of the oddest, most unique books I've ever read. And I haven't decided if that's a good thing or not.It's so weird that I cannot even ..If you try it, don't stop where you want to. Give it 40% of the way through to get the vibe. If you don't like it by then just remove your grease paintand delete it from your Kindle.If the book wasn't so odd, it would rate 5 starts. But really.. a semi-posessed(?) clown, detective noir, walking dead gunsel sidekick named fatso (he ain't fat), rain, bleak darkness.. Oh, and an old Chrysler, cigarettes and Canadian Club. Way too odd for 5 stars.. but hey, I liked it.. I think?"
1,When readers yawn,"I don't know why I read as much as I did; I guess hoping for a clear point or plot or at least character development or backgrounds. I don't know if its the author or whoever transcribed this version, but someone working on a detective novel should have some basic knowledge of common handguns. I gave up about 20 pages shy of the end, just couldn't put any more effort into hoping for the good part"
1,Didn't even finish,"Some may like it, but it was not for me. The author could never pull me in. It was just weird and boring."
3,Decent mystery set in a truly bizarre fantasy world,This is a reasonably well done murder mystery of the Raymond Chandler variety. But the characters/setting in a post apocalyptic world where the dead walk etc etc borders on truly strange. I just couldn't buy into the premise.
5,Great product.,"I was glad to find this product on DVD. I have it on VHS and it was difficult to watch,"
3,Decent for price,"If you are looking for a little more bass, these seem to be better than most portable speakers. However, if you want to hear your music over something I recomend the Sony SRS M30. I drive a deisel FedEx truck & want to be able to hear my music over the engine & wind and I found that these speakers aren't quite as loud & loose more sound quality when turned up to their max volume."
5,Excellent for the price,I wanted some good sounding speakers for my office-space which was small enough to fit on my desk and had quality sounding bass. What caught my eye about these was the subwoofer. For the price I can't complain at all. I'm very satisfied.
4,Mini Mini Max,When I travel I want my bedtime music without earphones. These are good. The bass was limited but what do you expect from a speaker system that can fit in your coat pocket!
2,Very weak sound,"I bought these speakers to use with my laptop while stationed in Iraq back in 2006. I liked how portable they were, since they all fit in a convenient carrying case (often too small to neatly fit everything in there and still close the velcro). My biggest complaint is the sound being too quiet to really enjoy anything. The subwoofer (if you can call it that) provided almost decent bass sound, but went through batteries quickly- in fact I often didn't even use the subwoofer. The whole system is just way too weak for enjoyment. I say spend an extra $20 and get something more worth your while."
4,Preety and nice sound,"it has a really nice sound but not much volume, but i think that for the price and size its an excelent buy."
3,Good little system,"As a portable set of speakers, it works fairly well. The sound is as expected, and it looks great when setup. However, I'll note two minor problems: 1. The AC adapter that comes with it doesn't operate on 220v! Since I imagine most purchase this to travel with, I find it unbelievable that they wouldn't include an adapter that operates on both 110 and 220 (like most laptops and other portable devices I own). Essentially I only use the battery option, which works fine, but give me a break! 2) The subwoofer's little buttons rattle when the speaker is operating, therefore, you have to place a little pen on top or something to ""quiet"" them down. :) Other than that, it is a great compact little system."
2,"Not a bad read, but don't expect any spectacular revelations","Blackjack is a game that is easy to understand and nearly impossible to master. It is also a game that is largely influenced by how people play. The odds will vary depending on compliance with basic strategy. For a new player, the basic strategy chart will be useful, as may the description of gameplay. But the suggested betting strategies and card counting techniques are nothing but snake-oil! I'd recommend Andy Glazier's works over this book to experienced as well as inexperiened players."
5,Back to the Roots,"Ive been a fan for a while, and i thoroughly enjoyed KoRn and Life is Peachy, the first two albums. Then... Follow The Leader came. Great CD, but it was too rap oriented for my taste, with songs like ""Children of the KoRn"", ""Cameltosis"" and ""All In The Family"". Now, ""Issues"" has come out and I could not be happier! This music has the wonderful grooves and heavier sound of the first CD. When you pop in this CD, you either are digging the sound or the volume isn't on! Buy it now!"
3,Expectations too high? It's not bad.,"Korn said they rushed Peachy to the market and it showed. I think they might have rushed this one too. JD said the sound reminded him of the first album but I don't hear it. The guitars seem to get lost while Fieldy's bass over-dominates. Head and Munkey are the best guitar duo in the industry but I think they're trying to ""experiment"" alittle too much. As the hippies say, ""Simplify, man"". Korn understands that bands need to grow and stay fresh but I think they also have to maintain some loyalty to the original sound and style that they used to bring dignity back to music. This cd is still better than most of the stuff out there but by Korn's standards they could have done better."
5,KoRn decided to experiment... and it worked.,"Issues is unlike any of KoRn's other albums. It is more depressing and eerie than the others because Jon Davis had just recently gotten off of Speed (I know first-hand how hard that is) and was in a much darker mood. He decided to try something new with this album, experiment a bit. And I have to say that it worked. Issues is wonderful, even amazing in some areas, and although it takes awhile to get used to, it is by no means a dissapointment."
4,Korn's best album,"This album, being consistent all along with the dark, gothic atmosphere we know from ""blind"", is their best album for those who would go for the debut album rather than ""follow the leader"". The transitions between songs keep the album as a whole and though it seemingly has the mood to get you down and blues, i always find myself exhilarated and finally, the song ""hey daddy"" is just one of the best works of korn. The great bass and vocal's harmony is incredible, definitely my favorite song from Korn."
2,Korns Best,"I reckon these guys could be a good band. Maybe if Jon Davis stopped getting all these rap artists to appear on his CD's, their guitarists were a lot heavier. The drummer doesnt need to change. There are a lot of better bands out there, Please, go try Superjoint Ritual, Danzig, or Slayer. This CD is full of fake/weird/interlude songs anyway. Maybe only get it if you see it at Cash Converters for a dollar or two."
4,A GOOD CD BUT NOT THE BEST,"This KoRn cd is pretty good, but not the best KoRn work ever. I would say this was the worst cd KoRn put out although it is good. On this album they go to a more softer mood and are not quite as heavy. Their are a couple of good songs on here such as Falling Away From Me, Beg For Me, Somebody Someone, Wake Up, and Dirty. If your looking to get a KoRn cd, grab the self-titled before you get any other KoRn cd out their."
2,Pitiful: Korn has Fallen,"I've been listening to KoRn since ""Blind"" first blared from my cassette player around a decade ago. I was thoroughly impressed with the self-titled album and the tracks on it such as ""Daddy,"" ""Shoots & Ladders,"" etc. Not too long after was the emergence of Life is Peachy which is even better in my opinion. When Follow the Leader came out I wasn't feeling the power of the first two albums. ""Got the Life"" just wasn't Korn to me. TRL seemed to appreciate it though. I still kept my faith in KoRn's talent... and then there was ISSUES. This album isn't worth the time. It's the same old trendy, teeny-bopper [music]. Untouchables isn't much better. If you want to get a good KoRn album, but either KoRn or Life is Peachy."
3,issues,"korn is an awesome band and this was a good cd, but definitely not one of the best by korn. it could have been better, but it was still worth buying."
3,Issues,"KoRn's new CD Issues, like Follow The Leader is a very good album being that it has a number of catchy beats, but also, like Follow The Leader, the CD lacks the emotion that the self titled and Life Is Peachy had. The lyrics in Follow The Leader and this one plainly show that Jon just wants people to feel sorry for him. The self titled and Life Is Peachy seem to vent out more Issues than this album did. It's just a less hip-hop version of Follow The Leader. I don't know where the hell Jon is getting the idea that Issues has the style of the first album. I still give full credit to Munky, Head, David, and Fieldy who, as always, did a great job."
2,Save Your Money Please!,This album was more hype than anything else. In trying to mix in some of their older stuff from Korn and Life is Peachy with the new stuff from Follow the Leader they ended up with some lame music. Korn should go back to their old stuff. Ask a friend to let you borrow it first and then you'll see what I mean. Every band produces trash so this counts as Korn's trash.
2,Disappointing. . .,"First of all I'd like to say that I am die-hard KoRn fan, and like others, I found this CD to be very dissapointing. In an attemp to live up to their debut, they failed miserably. First of all, the sounds are too ""poppish"" and soft. Also, it doesn't have that ""OOMPH!"" essence that Follow the Leader and the debut had, or the darkness of their first 3."
2,quite disappointing,"I have been a Korn fan pretty much since they started and after the brilliant third album 'follow the leader' i had high expectations for this album. I was very disappointed. The best song on this album, 'falling away from me' would only rate as about the seventh best song on 'folow the leader'. There are too many bad tracks on this album, and the better ones are still only mediocre.It seems that the band rushed this album - only a year between 'issues' and 'follow the leader'. The tracks are not polished and the heavy but clear riffs from the last album are replaced with unimaginative, repetitive, 'un-korn-like' ones.overall quite disappointing"
5,One of the best by Korn,"This album and album by korn that had alot of tracks on them which made it a very long album. I think it was different from their other albums not because of the style, but because there is not TOO many good songs on it, but the songs that are good are REALLY REALLY good. Some of the best songs by Korn are on this cd. The best songs on this cd are ""Falling Away from me"", ""Trash"", ""Make me Bad"", ""Somebody Someone"", ""Counting"", and ""Let's Get This Party Started"". When this album came out it was when Head and David were still with Korn, so that had alot to do with it's greatness. One of my favorites by Korn, great album."
5,This is the best album of the year!,i thought this was gonna be just as bad as follow the leader....in the sense that it was a sellout album...but this album is one i can see by listening to the lyrics they put alot more meaning in thier songs.my favorite track is Countingi love this album go out and buy it its worth it!
3,I was expecting better,"I was excited when they said it was like the first album, heavy. But after listening to it, I saw that there are only 4 songs which stand out, and another two which are interesting. The music is the only thing which keeps it alive, it's downright wierd, and the best feature of the CD. Even though it doesn't have the same head banging quality of the first. The lyrics have lost the edge, and are harder to relate to. Korn and Life is Peachy are better in this field, by far.""Let's get this part started"" is probably my favorite track, with ""Trash"" in a close second."
4,Korn are still at it,"Korn changed their sound with each album... with a trend heading towards a lighter sound than their first album. They promised a return to the first album with this one, however it isn't quite that heavy. It's heavier than Follow The Leader, and is just as innovative. Their first single, Falling Away From Me, is great. Other good tracks are Lets Get This Party Started (my personal favorite on the disc), Trash, and Hey Daddy. I hope they can keep up their music with this quality."
5,Back to the Basics....AWESOME,"This is the best album of 1999 by far. Coming from one the the heaviest bands out there, Korn delivers once again, only this time with a much darker and heavier sound. This will definetly be hard to get out of my CD player for a long time to come."
4,Better and better everytime I'm listening to it,"The first time I heard it, I was'nt sure if it was a really good korn album but has I listen again and again, I found that ISSUES was the second greatest korn album (after self-titled)! the music gets better and better on every album. Jonhatan's voice is a bit annoying sometimes when he sorts of whispering but when he starts to scream, it's like an explosion of dense energy! It sucks that it does'nt even have featurings on it tough... If you liked follow the leader, you'll like this one for sure! recommended songs : wake up, counting, somebody someone, let's gets this party started and falling away from me."
4,Great Album!,"This is the best CD I've bought in a while. I only liked a couple of songs on ""Follow the Leader"", so I'm not sure what made me buy this album as soon as it came out, but I'm really glad I did. Unlike the last album, I can listen to Issues all the way through without skipping any songs. Most tracks have great beats and some really cool, erie sounds. The singing is much better than the last album also (more melody, less screaming). I really hope Korn continues in this direction."
1,I thought it was gonna be like the first cd,"Cough Cough cellouts Korn,what happened to the angry music,and the rage.Where did it all go......into the gutter.I used to love KoRn but they rushed the cd and they edited his voice to much and I hate the new KoRn fans that started to like KoRn when they came out with their slow tuned annoying ""follow the leader"" whoever recomends you to buy this has their head in their.....well you know.I recomend you buy it if your an alternative fan but if your into their selftitled disk and ""life is peachy""dont touch it.Nice try Korn,your ending up like limp bizkit..........sell outs.....KoRn needs to stop editing over and get their acts together and come out with an all out hard core cd with screaming and yelling...please"
1,don't waste your money,im a big korn fan but am greatly dispointed with their new cd issues. The cover song falling away from me is good but the rest of the album is just jonathan davis crying or screaming i dont know what they were thinking when they released this album
1,I HATE THIS ALBUM,"The problem with Amazon.com is that they don't let you give negative stars. I can't say enough bad things about this album and about KoRn (sorry there is no backwards ""R"") KoRn is Just a bunch of KrAp of rage on the stage. I'll give them that they're original. Issues is all about how ridiculous and how many cusswords you can fit in one song. This is hardly what I'd call rock. If you're looking for rock Creed, is the only good new rock band, Pearl Jam is the old one. KoRn is really just bad singing and rapping over a really pathetic ""guitarist"". Hardly what I call good rock or even good music. If you're buying this CD, chances are your following the trend of KoRn freaks like my brother. BE ORIGINAL, try listening to some Nirvana, Pearl Jam, ETC... something with real feeling and meaning to it. If you like true rock don't by this CD because you will be disgusted at today's view of rock."
3,KoRn can do better than this.,"'Issues' by KoRn just might be their worst album to date.While its actually not bad,its not very good either.Its medicore.Theres a few standout tracks that are awesome,but then there are some annoying ones that you will skip each time you listein to this album.I don't really consider anything on this a real classic either.Its hard and heavy though and it features no rap like their last album(which I didn't mind but other people seem to complain about it).You can go on in life skipping this album - its nothing really special and its a little annoying.Buy the other albums by KoRn instead."
1,Unlistenable,"I bought this CD after listening to Falling away from me. Unfortunately this is the only good song on the CD. After listening to the CD for an hour you just feel that you have to stop the music before you're going mad. Some songs can be Ok, but if you listen to the entire album it is far from splendid. I'm not so into Korn's music anymore, but I have friend who likes them and who agrees that this is the worst Korn album. The extremely [bad] guitar-riffs are not good either. Everything on this album has been done before."
1,another dissapointment,"i was a huge korn fan after their self titled debut and life is peachy, however they have gone strait downhill. lyrics are poor as well as the song writing. korn sold out. period."
1,a brief review,"horrible lyrics, one good song, too much whineing, many pointless songs, many stupid messages from songs, get their album KoRn instead, and you shall be happier. Told you i'd be brief."
1,More proof that todays rock music sucks,"After reading all of the below reviews, I can finally say that todays youth wouldn't know good music if it came up and bit them. The lyrics on this album are terrible at best. THIS ALBUM SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE FOLLOW THE LEADER (an album which sucked all most as much as this one). If Korn thinks they can throw some boring album together and expect it to sell, then they're right. Look how many people gave this a good review. John can't sing, nor write lyrics, Munky and Head are using the same dreadful guitar riffs that were on the last album, Fieldy, I can't really say anything good or bad about him, simply because it's really hard to be a bad bass player, and as for the drums, they've been going downhill since Life is Peachy. I truely doubt that anyone will actually listen to this, simply because the people who are reading this review are the same people who make Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock celebrities. Put simply: AVOID THIS ALBUM!"
2,its korn,ok this cd is boreing and weak at times i feel im in church listening to a choir sing but oh well. korn just has gone downhill KORN was awesome a classic lip was great Ftl was a dissapoitment and Issues is just to boreing. i have evolved from listening to korn all the time to expanding into SLIPKNOT and NOTHINGFACE now this is real hard rock. all i can say is korn is only a shell of its former self RIP KORN
2,Disappointed,"If you like Korn for thier hardness and thier in your face lyrics. Then you won't really like this new album. There is 3 good, almost normal Korn songs on this CD. There are 2 other songs that are ok and that's out of 16 songs (listed). Like my title says I'm very disappointed."
2,Korn has finally gone Mainstream.,"I checked out this CD the day it was released. I have to say that i am very unpleased with it. I've been listening to Korn since they were unknown, and they seem to have finally let the Record company mold them into a mainstream band. There is too many different sounds being smushed together on the CD, and what the Hell is going on with the Singing nonsense. It sounds like Korn hung out with N'Sync during their recording sessions. I give the album a 2. 1 point because of their album cover contest and the 2nd point because they've totally snowed all of their real fans. Good thing one of my friends bought the CD before me."
2,DOESN'T CLICK,"""ISSUES"" MAKES KORN SEEM TERRIBLE. ITS JUST A POOR SEQUEL TO ""FOLLOW THE LEADER"". I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE FOLLOW THE LEADER BUT ITS BETTER THAN THIS. KORN IS DYIING, FACE IT, THEY AREN'T GOOD ANYMORE. DONT GO WITH THIS CD, ITS BORING, THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I LOVED KORN WITH A PASSION....TODAY IM GIVING UP ON THEM"
2,"typical, weak and uninspired","Korn don't prove themselves to be any better with this dreck. Listened to it twice and gave it to my sister, utterly boring"
5,2nd best korn cd,"follow the leader is a barely better cd, but this cd is everything a korn fanatic expects. all songs are good, and the lyrics have stories that relate to jhon davis's life. number 2-6 and 9-10 and 13 are probably the best songs on the album, but the song for you i about jhon davis's life with his wife kim."
5,AWESOME BABYYYYY!,This SeeDee (notice spelling) is the best one yet im gonna write more so it can get 5 stars dam nit great guitar great lyrics after all i flirt with suicide sometimes it kills the pain
4,"Korn still rocks, just not as good as the other albums","While I have become a very big Korn fan in the last few years(I did not know about these guys until about 2 years ago), I am saddened by the fact that these guys seem to be losing their edge a bit. I have all four of Korn's album, and by far this album does not rock me like the first album did. While I am a very emotionally charged and angst ridden young man, I still think there are other groups(Rage Against the Machine and NIN to be exact) that portray the anger in a more brilliant fasion."
3,"Good, but could have been better","The latest from KoRn was good but not great. The only good songs on it were ""Trash"" and ""Somebody Someone"" as well as the two singles ""Make Me Bad"" and ""Falling Away From Me."" Those are about th only songs I listen to. The other songs are very basic and a little boring. Comparing the change between KoRn's debut, and Issues, is like comparing Limp Bizkit debut with Significant Other. Now I will admit that I don't own KoRn's first 2 CDs, but I have downloaded mp3 clips, and I think there should be songs similar to ""Blind"" and ""ADIDAS"" on here, but unfortunately, there won't be. The guitars are all good, but their music has gotten a little more boring."
3,It ROCKS! ....but not very original................,When i heard it for the first time i though that it sound too much like the first two albums....but after a while.....YEAH! .......is not as good as FOLLOW THE LEADER........ but still rocks!....
2,KoRn,"KoRn fan neeed to lern to melow out and rock and thrash and rock and enjoy the music, cuz this dont git no beter then ISSUE! Beets are tite an this c.d. is there touhgest disk to date! I lik to bang my head til this d.c. alot. stop fihgteng about wether its like other ones--just rock! it's good1"
5,KORN!,"Even though I had heard that this album wasn't the best, I got it and found out that this wasn't so. I mean, even though this is the only album I have from them, I still think that this is their best yet. I'd have to say the best tracks on here are ""Trash"", ""Beg For Me"", and ""Wake Up""."
3,ok,i'm not really a big korn fan but i got this cd because of somebody someone its a good song but there r only like 2 other good ones or something like that but if ur a big korn fan u should get it but if ur looking for something different give this cd a try over all its an ok cd.
4,It's Not So Bad,"Okay, I've heard enough of those little comments like Korn is sold out or this album is horrible....ITS NOT THAT BAD! Yes I am a big fan and I dont think that this was by far the best album, but they are growing and changing with time..... if you dont like this particular album......THEN DONT LISTEN TO IT! The reasons I like this album is first and formost JONATHAN CAN SING EXTREMELY WELL! I know many people dont like his vocal delivary but I do. My favorite songs are Dirty, Make Me Bad, Trash and I'ts Gonna Go away. He has an amazing voice which is heartfelt and emotional( not to mention he is really really sexy....hehe) Anyway, I wouldnt shy amay from this album because they have not sold out and that is my final word.....so deal with it."
3,It's a good CD......,"just not up to the normal KoRn standards, but it's great when compared to most other CD's. It doesn't even touch the Self Titled. It kind of sounds like on big song with strange bridges."
3,Fair,"I am a really big Korn fan, but this cd just didn't please me. I mean Korn was usually the outlet to get out your anger and frustration and now that Korn's giving to that slow melodic, powerhouse lyrics, its just not the same effect. For heavy Metal, I would reccomend Godsmack, as they are one of the only new bands that hasnt tried to copy Korns rap/rock fusion, this album just needs more raw energy and intensity behind it, for Korn fans, i would reccomend anything from Korn to Follow the Leader, but unless you feel it necassary to own every Korn cd, this one can afford to be passed up."
3,Um.....oh...kay,"Well, first of all, Im happy they took away that damn rap influence. This album is...psychotic. I dunno, after three albums Jonathan Davis keeps on whining. and his problems seem to be getting worse. I mean ""Trash"" ? come on? Im sorry. I just dont relate to the overwhelming desire to have sex with a little girl...sorry jon. but musically this is sound. it wont blast your ears like the first one. but its hard enough. I like the experimental little interlude things. they should have made those longer though because the interludes usually had the most interesting sounds. anywho...buy this album if your a KoRn fan. otherwise burrow it and decide for yourself...the standout tracks are ""Falling away from me"", ""No way"" and ""Dirty"""
4,This Is More Like It,"After the dissapointing KoRn-Follow The Leader CD this is a very great CD, probably my secondd favourite CD the first one being my favourite.The reason i love Korn so much is cause' I can relate to what they say in their songs.Fave Songs: Lets Get This Party Started, Dirty and Somebody Someone.Worst Song:Make Me Bad (What The Hells It Supposed To Be About?)"
3,HUGE Disappointment,"OK, what the hell happened to Korn? They never used to sound like this. They've lost all of their edge. They once possessed a distinguishable sound from other bands...now they've melted into the mainstream. I'll stick to my first three albums, thank you very much."
2,Experimentation is not always good.,"I have one Major problem with this album. Jon has a VERY talented voice. Yet on this cd, far too often, his voice is being warbled, distored, or put through some odd effect. This only takes away from the Korn experience, and left me feeling that this was some poser band trying to sound like Korn, as the unique vocals just weren't there."
2,"Disappointed, I can't believe it they went soft","If you like Korn for thier hardness and thier in your face lyrics. Then you won't really like this new album. There is 3 good, almost normal Korn songs on this CD. There are 2 other songs that are ok and that's out of 16 songs (listed). Like my title says I'm very disappointed."
1,Is this considered music?,"This is by far one of the many horrible attepmts at creating good heavy music from the States. This album, along with every Corn, Limp Biscuit, etc, is some of the worst music possible. I'd rather listen to the Backstreet Boys: at least they make horrible music for an already horrible style, but with these ""heavy"" bands, they put a bad name to great metal! It's too bad Americans support such nonsense.......real music you ask? OPETH, KATATONIA, IN FLAMES, OCTOBER TIDE, CHILDREN OF BODOM, EDGE OF SANITY, DARK TRANQUILLITY, TRISTANIA, THEATRE OF TRAGEDY, ACTURUS, DIMMU BORGIR, EMPEROR, BEETHOVEN, CHOPIN, STRAVINSKY, DEBUSSY, etc. ...... real music!"
1,Garbage... plain and simple. Garbage.,"Perhaps verging on the fine line between my hatred of rap and sell-outs lies KoRn. This ""music"" has disillusioned millions, bought the souls of ""Children of the Korn"" everywhere and made a mockery of the once noble genre of Rock and Roll. If you enjoy Korn's recent releases under their corporate ownership, you are a follower. You do not know what music is. You know nothing about this band. You only like what is popular. I mean, honestly, you buy an album from a renound sell-out band, titled ""Follow the Leader"" (you, the niave buyer) and expect to be accepted as a fan of rock? How dare you even assosciate this trash and all you want to believe in with music that has meaning. I hate all of you. For all of you who believe Follow the Leader was a ""great debut album"" as I have actually heard before, I have one thing to say... you are losers. God, I miss Cobain..."
1,I have an Issue,"Korn: A) a music group hailing from Southern California who released a groundbreaking self-titled debut in 1994. B) A group that had the potential to change the landscape of rock music forever, but chose to throw it all away for monetary considerations. C) see also SELLOUTS."
4,not bad for nu-metal,"I'm not a big fan of Korn and nu-metal bands but this cd isn't that bad. It has a lot more melody, ...and less mindless screaming than their older albums. I guess that's why I like it."
1,its a shame...,"what happened?? korn used to be the ideal metal group. slow, hard-driving, melodic metal combined with the amazing lyrics of jon davis. now i hear this, and i just want to scream in disgust. you are probably saying ""eh, you are one of the wanna-be's that got on the bandwagon when follow the leader was released."" no. i got OFF the bandwagon when follow the leader came out. i have been a korn fan for as long as they have been around, and i can safely say that the band that put out issues is NOT the same band that put out one of the most amazing rock albums ever 6 years ago."
1,edwardscissorhands,i guess this cd is great for those kids going through a confusing time in their life and they feel like they need to fit in.and for kids that have all this anger built up in them just because its the trendy thing to have.ANGER ANGER MORE ANGER!haha.
1,this cd is sh- - !,"how can you people listen to this sh--. I wish i could give it less than one star, but this review thing wouldnt let me. alternative rock stations that play this stuff are wrecking all good music. take slipknot for an example: they play the slowest song on the cd; then as people start to like that song, slipknot thinks that people like the slow music. So then the next cd that they put out will be slow. DONT YOU PEOPLE GET IT! YOU ARE WRECKING GOOD MUSIC BY LISTENING TO THIS SH--."
1,Sob....poor me...life stinks...yada yada yada,"Death, rage, death, violence, depravity, death, suicide, and...erm...DEATH! (Did I already mention death?)This is so pathetic. Another band of morose [souls] screeching about the underbelly of life. Jeez, take a walk, see the blue sky, go sit by the ocean, listen to the wind rustle through the trees, talk to a friend, and get a freakin' LIFE...."
1,Korn really is a sell out band!,"I've been listening to Korn since Life is PEachy, and I just have to say, this piece of trash disapointed me. I had a feeling Korn would turn out this way after the large success of Follow the Leader, which wasn't that good hold a few songs. I am upset and disgusted, Korn is simplifying their music for a younger audience so they can reach more people, I think it's horrible. I am not against bands making it big, but when they feel that they have to release rushed products to please a mass audience they are losing it. Korn made better music when they weren't in the mainstream, and I wish at least if they were popular they could make as good music as they did back in the days of Korn and Life is Peachy."
4,2nd best album,"Let's get this out in the open. Been a Korn fan when people who like them now where saying turn this off. There first cd was the best followed by Issues, Follow the Leader, and then the Krapy Life is Peachy. Anyone who likes that cd is not a true Korn fan. There's maybe 3 good song's on it. The reason why people might not like this cd is because it's darker and a little slower. I thought that they went more commercial on FTL then on Issues. This cd sounds nothing like any of there cd's. So they have 4 cd's that sound nothing alike. I like Jonathan's voice and I wished in some song's it wouldn't have been hiding behind the music. If you just listen to the lyrics of Jonathan Davis you should really like this album. I recomend it."
2,Korn's fourth album is fourth best one,"Although ""Falling away from Me"" was a good start, this Cd has nothing else.It doesn't compare to Korns first three. The songs are all the same and very comparable to the first three Cds. No songs stand out to me. I await for Korn's next album to outdo this one"
4,Issues,"Korn is one of my favorite bands out there so when the long-awaited Issues CD came out on November 16, I went to Best Buy and bought it. I played it the whole way through and I was astonished at the CD. The music was incredible and they spent a lot of time producing this release. Jonathon Davis returns with his abrasive vocals while Fieldy, Head, MunKy, and David put their entire hearts into such songs as Falling Away From Me and Counting. Each song is worth hearing even though some of them are hardly two minutes long. This isnt one of those releases where you want to say, ""Hey, turn it to number 6"" or something along the lines of that. Any Korn or rock fan will definitly want to check Issues out."
5,KoRn rocks!,"This is a great CD. It's not KoRn's best but it's up there. The best songs on here are Falling Away From Me, Trash, Wake Up, Somebody Someone, Let's get this party started, and Dirty. I also recomend buying KoRn's self-titled CD."
3,Sorry to say it...,"Honestly, I listened to this cd at a friend's house and was not all that impressed. This is not just because it isn't as heavy, but more beacuase most of the songs were kind of dull. Earlier KoRn is much better. If you do want some good hard-rock pick up System of a Down, A Perfect Circle, or TOOL."
3,Hardcore soft KoRn?,"When I heard this album for the first time I was highly dissapointed. The female backing vocals and added jingles reminded me of a trashy pop album but if you ignore the odd pop reference and instead look to Jonathan Davis' excellently restrained vocals you can get enjoyment out of some very catchy songs on this album. It is most certainly softer than other KoRn offerings such as 'Follow the leader' (my personal favourite) but if you're unsure of whether you'll like KoRn or not because your most played CD is some weak pop album, listen to this before the others. I would give this 3 1/2 stars if it would let me, as there are some good songs here, just not the usual style."
2,Not the best way to go,"This cd wasnt horrible but it damn sure isn't great. The best tracks were Falling Away From Me, Make Me Bad and Dirty. There were just too many bad filler songs. Korn is still the best,but this was their worst cd. Hopefully Korn will Do better on their new album."
5,This CD is AWESOME!,This cd is not the best i think their self-titled cd is the best then this then follow the leader then life is peachy. If there is any korn fans out there that does not have this cd should get!
5,Korn's Kareer Pinnakle,"""Issues"" is a top-notch hard rock album, and one that cements Korn's status as an elite band in its genre. It moves far past the teeny-bopper image that the band got following the immense success of their last album, ""Follow the Leader,"" and brings Korn's talents into focus. Any comparisons to Limp Bizkit should be stricken from the record from here on; there is no rap influence anywhere on here, just loud, angry rock n' roll (and that's the way we like it). Jonathan Davis certainly has his own issues, but I'm glad he shared them with us."
4,groovy,"I listened to korn's cd issues and thought it was grrrreat! even though their lyrics are kind of ""wierd"", their lyrics make them unique and that is what makes a good band ""good"". i would definately recommend this cd to those people who like this type of music. Korn is ""Phat"" and they are definately going to stay at #1 in my fav. list for a long long time!"
4,"Issues, very good album","when you think about it, there is much to criticize about this album. but then you realize that this album is just great. Aside from the five 1 minute fillers, the other 11 songs are just incredible. I am a new Korn fan and i only have 2 of their albums, iSSUES and Untouchables, and as Untouchables is better than this album, Issues is still a great album with awesome songs such as one of my favorite Korn songs ever ""Make me bad"", and then there is ""trash"" ,""fallin away from me"", ""counting"", ""wake up"", and other great songs full of lyrics with distinct emotion sung by the incredible jon davis. I never thought i would like korn , but this is an incredible album. I cant wait to get their others despite the fact that i heard that they had different sounds.get this cd, its great"
4,Great stuff,very mainstream but i dont care its still good... all of the songs are awesome... heavy cd. but the first release is the best... GET THIS IF YOU LOVE KORN!
3,"Very creative, makes you wonder...what happened?","This is Korn at its most creative, the guitars venture outside the realm of mindless grinding riffs and go for something a bit calmer and creepier. The lyrics are different and add to the depressing mood. ""falling away from me"" ""make me bad"" ""Beg for me"" and ""Dirty"" are excellent songs but are the only ones that are real complete songs, the rest are lacking at some point. The mindless filler tracks that are all about a minute long are annoying, but this was a good experiment by korn, and it makes you wonder where they'd be if they had continued down this path."
4,Issues are plentiful,"Having watched Korn since they emerged, but never really taken time out to listen to their music or shows to any extent, the time was now...The END OF DAYS soundtrack with their track Camel Song got me pumping (best track on there a long with GNR`s Oh My God) and I picked up first Life Is Peachy and now Issues.Issues is brilliant. The sonic assault is inventive yet - now - what can be called klassic Korn (with a k). You`ll be bopping to this. Lyrically, Jonathan is as haunting as ever - Trash is Faith No More`s RV Part 2. Great lyrics. And this throughout. Issues stays with you./regards - Peterps : Another thing. Axl Rose - who`s been out to lunch for 7 years somewhere in Malibu - has allegedly been spotted at ONLY two live shows all that time. The first was Radiohead. The other was Korn. That says something - right there. When Rose zooms in on anything, it is something worthwhile. Yowsa!"
2,Wow I NEVER THOUGH I WOULD SAY THIS..!,"I have been the biggest diehard korn fan..but..i cant beleive im about to say this...thet keep getting worse...there first cd was the best cd ever back when they were ""Real"" now theve let it get to their heads.this cd bores me....i cant belive im saying this...i have to shoot myself now..! aagghhh!"
4,Better than the Follow the leader,Issues have more heavy sound than Follow the Leader and i like of heavy sound.Korn is not a rock band is a metal band.You guys listen the first cd.
2,R.I.P. KoRn (1994-1998),"KoRn was once my favorite band. Their first 2 albums are still some of the coolest stuff ever. Then Follow The Leader came along! And they sold them selfs to all those damn mindless Mtv kids! Now KoRn has killed them selfs with this album. The first few times I played it I loved it! I thought KoRn was back! But, later it proved to be annoying, and repetitive! KoRn is still a band of really cool people! and I hope they put out some real heavy music again soon! but for now, I'm going to stick with Slayer, SlipKnot, Machine Head, and PanterA."
3,A change,"Those looking for more of the same from Korn's last album may be a little disapointed. The very accurately titled album concentrates and Johnathan Davis's sorrow and pain rather than anger and angst as was the case in Korn's other album's. This is not to say that the album is bad. For those of us who love korn it is a must add to your collection. It keeps in tradition with Korn's past by curtailing melody in favor of raw emmotion, but at times will prevoke you to weep rather than rage."
5,Best KoRn yet,"this is the best korn album yet. i love all the songs on the cd. it is heavey, while some songs like 4u keep it good. this is definately the best korn cd yet, john davis is a freakin awesome singer, and the rest of the band rocks. there is such a range of emotions on this cd, it really keeps it going. buy this cd! i've been a korn fan for a while, and the is the best yet."
4,Pretty Good Album,"This cd is pretty good, but nothing compared to their first cd. I would say this cd ties with ""follow the leader"" for 2nd best korn cd. ""life is peachy"" being the least best. And to all those ""supposedly"" korn fans just because they come out with a new album doesn't mean you automatically give it 5 stars just cuz it's korn. i would defenitley agree with the band that this is an experimental album. Jonathan Davis really experiments with diferrent vocal distortions. Guitars pretty much sound the same as does feildly on bass. The best songs on here are Somebody Someone, Trash, Wake up, Let's get this party started, and Dirty. If you are a korn fan get this album , you won't be dissapointed"
3,Slowly going down hill,"If you are a true KoRn fan then you will be disappointed by this Cd it is nougthing like the first three and i quite frankly thought it an insult to all the fans out there. The music just isn't the same as it used to be. I mean i'm not saying that i hate KoRn in fact the complete oppisite i just thing that this album was a chance for them to do something more like there first album. It seems to me that all the band that rock or have pentical to rock have been puting out sad sad albums this year. take for example Limp Bizkit. Last year there album tore it up. But this years album suck rocks. So what I'm saying is that if you want a good KoRn album don't buy this one either buy ""KoRn"" Life Is Peachy"" Or ""Follow The Leader"". Because in contrast those album are forever better then the sad wreck that is ""Issues"""
5,This album made me a Korn fan,"This is the first Korn album I have ever bought and it rocks.Issues has to be the best album of the year hands down.The songs Beg for me and Trash are down right the best metal songs I've heard in years ,yes even beating Metallica and Megadeth.This album brings back the return of metal that has been missing since the early 90's.I stongly recommend Korn ,Issues to all metal loving fans,so enjoy.One other thing be sure to get the winning cover the others are not very good."
2,Good God KoRn has NOT gotten back to their roots at all.,"God,once again,KoRn has pulled it off and lied to their fans once again. This is not a good album at all,they have drastically changed,and NOT for better,rather for worse. They say its more ""emotional"" but come on,the spice girls can come up with better lyrics than this. KoRn has dissapointed me once again...AND I AM A KORN FAN,BUT IM GETTING USED TO THIS,JON ALWAYS SAYS ITS GOING TO BE LIKE THE FIRST ALBUM,ONLY TO FIND OUT IT IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. Well,not all the tracks are bad,lets get this party started,trash,make me bad,and wake up are pretty good..my favorites are trash and make me bad. BUT OVERALL,IT FEELS RUSHED...SAVE YOUR MONEY TOWARDS THE NEXT KORN ALBUM.. (THEY'LL PROBABLY SAY ITS A LOT LIKE THE FIRST ONE) WELL I DONT CARE IF YOU DONT LIKE MY OPINION,IT IS NOT LIKE I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT YOURS."
3,Good CD Little dissapointed,"Dont get me wrong. I like the CD. It's dark and gloomy more like the original korn CD. But My big issue with it is theres no where as near as many songs that grab ya from the first listen as say ""blind"" or ""something takes a part of me"" It's just not has Smash your face into the wall as the last albums. But it is still very good. My biggest disappointment is the production quality. It seems very muddy to me compaird to Follow the leader. The Guitar and drums are definatly hidden behind the sometimes wayy to loud Bass."
5,Dope Dope Dope sweet sounds added new effects to music,this cd is very good if you liked follow the leader it has about 9 good songs on it and korn did a great job on mastering this cd by adding effects to their music this cd never gets boring only downside is that theres 4 songs that are less than 1:30 long and really stupid but the rest of the cd is awesome go check my page for real player and mp3 filez (limp bizkit)
3,Not what I expected,"Now, I love KoRn, and when I bought this I was expecting to be blown away. As much as I hate to say it, I was put to sleep. Sure, its got some good songs, but it doesn't compare to the other CDs. But its pretty good, if you are a real KoRn fan."
4,"Great new music from Korn, but doesn't match old quality.","A few months ago, when I looked at korn.com's updates page and Jon said the new album would be a lot like their first self titled album, I got excited; mostly because the first album was my favorite. When issues came out, I listened to it.. and there are some great new tunes, but it doesn't have the quality or lyrics that the past few albums had."
1,Korn are a bunch of sellouts!,Korn is not hard and heavy like people say! they svck! Jonathon Davis can't sing! Munky can't play the guitar! and neither can Fieldy and Head! But i have to admit David the drummer is a very good drummer! But thats not the point the point is that Korn is not metal! If you guys want to hear hard music you guys should hear the band Slipknot there fvcking awesome!
4,3rd best CD,"I will rate this CD song by song: #1-stinks. isn't even a song #2-Classic. Pure Korn. #3-OK. #4-stinks #5-not that bad #6-This song is sweet. nice beat #7-weird #8-heavy, heavy stuff. the kiddies should get the edited version #9-stinks #10-eerie, but very,very sweet #11- BEST SONG,I don't care what u say #12-stinks #13-ok #14-stinks #15-ok #16-ok Overall, this CD is ok, worth your money. Not as good as Follow the Leader, or their debut album."
5,Best KoRn CD YET,"Out of all the cds, this is by far the greatest one. Anyone that says old-KoRn is better is stupid as hell. The songs are heavier now than they were 6 years ago and the talent level is through the roof now. And they ARE NOT SELL-OUTS! Just because they have millions of fans that demand to see them on MTV and want to buy KoRn-gear dosen't make them sell-outs. Any band that says they won't sell-out just isn't good enough to be famous. AND THEY ARE LIGHT-YEARS BETTER NOW THAN BEFORE."
1,What were they thinking?,"I am a huge fan of all of the korn albums, except this one, and apparently, korn wasn't a big fan of this album either, because their last two albums were nothing like issues. Untouchables was way harder, and Take a look in the mirror was hard and fast, like the rest of their albums. Way to much filler and nit enough killer to seal the deal on this album."
1,KoRns worst cd,"When I first got issues,I couldent wait to listein to it.I mean,it hade alot of hype and four different album covers,so I was thinking it would be a great album!But I was wrong,this is Korns worst cd.There are only two good songs(Falling away from Me and Trash)plus this cd gets old quick.Do not buy this cd!"
4,"Good cd, but deffinitely not Korn's best","This is a pretty good cd, but not korn's best. Their self-titled is better than any other one they have made. Best songs on issues are falling away from me, dirty, counting and somebody someone. Korn has not gone commercial and never will. they just put out a decent album this time...not a great album. and ill speak for the korn fans that have been with them since '94... if you think follow the leader and issues are better than the 1st self titled and life is peachy then YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT."
2,What Happened?,"Well, I don't really know what to say! I loved KoRn when their debut came out, thought they were still cool when the second one came out, was still into them with the third, but this album just sucks. They are pulling a Limp Bizkit on us! Let's hope the next album is way, WAY better."
4,Korn's Worst Album,"This is Korn's worst album, but it does have two good songs, ""Make Me Bad"" & ""Somebody Someone"". The reason a lot of people,(including me), say that this is their worst, is because of songs like ""4U"", ""It's Gonna Go Away"", and ""Am I Going Crazy"". Those kinds of songs shouldn't even make it on an album. All they do is slow down everything, and make listening to the album boring. Every song on an album should be good and worth listening to. So, when they call this album an LP, I disagree with them, Korn just added in some tracks that aren't even real songs. THE REASON PEOPLE SAY KORN'S DEBUT IS THEIR BEST, IS BECAUSE IT FLOWS, IT ISN'T STOPPED BY SONGS LIKE THE ONES LISTED ABOVE."
1,Smile and the world smiles w/ you cry and you cry alone,HELLO FOLKS DONT BUY THIS ALBUMits really nothing more than what seems to be B-Sides and Skits. its really sad that through all the album its just Jon Crying about stuff.There are only about 6 songs and a whole mess'o skits. I really like the skits dead and for you.The singles that were released to this album are old and played out.oh and jon talks in that gruffy voice through alot o the album.
2,Boring,"This isn't the Worst record I've ever heard, but today this heavy teen angst metal stuff is everywhere. so anything in this genre is sort of played out."
2,"KoRn? I got some KoRn in my KRap, and vice versa.","Okay well I couldn't wait to buy this cd because I've been a bit of a fan of this group for a while. When I heard 'Falling away from me' on the radio I was like, 'Cool! I gotta get this cd!' And I did, and I was sorely disappointed. I don't know what KoRn was smokin' when they thought people might actually, I dunno, ENJOY this album? Falling away from me is one of maybe three or four songs on the cd that I would catagorize as 'listenable.' If every song they did had the same eerie guitar riffs and raw emotion of that song, the cd would be awesome. So KoRn, please wait just a little longer when you have a whole cd's worth of good songs before releasing another one, okay? One last thing- Falling Away From Me was the only thing keeping my review above one star. Awesome, killer song, horrible cd."
4,Better than Follow the Leader!!!!!!!!,"Ok this was better than Follow the Leader except it still had some rap in it I think? I hate rap and it really sucks so why wont it go away because all of the idiots love it. Anyway, this had sum cool guitar riffs and cool drummin but John D. Needs to start a new singing style."
2,IM Disappointed,"i own all of koRn's albums they are all great cd's but when i got issues i was stunned thet korn my favorite rock band could produce an album this poor! The entire c-d john davis complains about how much his life sux. i mean its ok to have a dark rock song with alot of thought put into it but when the entire cd is like that it gets boring! FOR ALL YOU NEW KORN FANS DO YOURSLF A FAVOR AND BUY ""FOLLOW THE LEADER OR KORN(SELF TITLED)"" THERE ALOT BETTER!"
2,Poor album by a sell out band,"Well, I had to sigh while listening to this album. Korn has lost what they had a long time ago. The songs are poorly constructed, and get rather redundant. The fact that I like Jonathan Davis' vocals is what convinced me to give this more than one star.If you're a die hard Korn fan, then by all means buy this album, but if you're a new listener looking for a great hardcore band, this is NOT what you expect. The music is very simple, with poor beat changes.Sorry Korn, this one fails in my book."
3,what the hell is all this filler?,"the first thing wrong right off the bat, 5 count em 5 short little 40 second filler interlude songs. i mean, what the hell? theyve never done that before. and second of all the songs are okay but most of them arent all that great. my favorite is make me bad. i really dont know about this one. its just.........blah.it seems to me that they get worse with each album. ""korn"" will always be the best, peachy is awesome, and on ftl, they went a little bit too far off course but it was still good. this just isnt what i would expect from korn."
4,i've got ISSUES,Korn.....one of the most powerful band of the 90's..this cd kicks big time! of course their frist CD will always be the best this one comes close
3,What happened!,"Before I start, Let me say that I have been a KoRn fan since before they sold out to TRL and preppy MTV. I was really excited to get this album, but then when i played it I was a little let down. They definetly grown musically and Jonathon's voice is much better, but it doesn't seem up to their standards. just by listening to it I can tell that they didn't take their time and they rushed to make it. I would have waited another year for them to perfect it, as long as it sounds good. It still killer, but they didn't put the time needed into it. Who cares if they did it to sell more records when their still on top? I'll still buy there music when their not. The fans will always be there, but the poser fans, who cling to any hot band like a leech and then drop when their not cool, aren't needed. A good album, but it could have been much better. I liked the lyrics to ""Beg For Me"" better at Woodstock, but it's still a cool song on the album. KoRn!"
5,this is great!,"Nothing beats korn--nothing! This album is one of their best, second only to follow the leader which I loved to death everyone buy it!"
5,This CD is true music.,I love this cd it totally rocks. Jonathan davis voice is great he feels his music. He truly is a musical artist.
5,Korn has done it again with another fantastic album.,"Korn is definately the greatest band of our time. Their self-titled album totally blew me away. Their 2nd album, ""Life is Peachy"" was absolutely ground-breaking. I listen to both nearly every day. I was rather disappointed with ""Follow the Leader"" mainly because it lacked the raw emotion and rage of the first 2. But ""Issues"" is awesome. When you first listen to it, you can tell it is way different from the first 3. It lacks the scat lyrics (which totally sucks!) but is a must-have for any Korn fan. Definately go out and buy this album!"
5,it grows on ya,"i will be the first to admit i didn't really like this cd when i gave its first spin. i am a huge fan of korn. So i gave myself an hour and gave it anther spin. it really grew on my. i acutally like more tracks on this cd than i do on any other of their cds. my favorite is the infectious track 12 No Way, the haunting Let's Get this Party Started. Make Me Bad which vocally Jon Davis sounds a little like Axl Rose during the chorus...i also really like Hey Daddy, Beg For Me, Trash, and of course Falling Away From Me. very good guys great cd."
4,korn lives,"This is a weaker album of KoRn but still a good one. It has hints of Life Is Peachy and Follow the Leader and has a sound all its own. I think the stand out tracks are ""Falling Away From Me"" and ""Wake Up"". The rest are ok songs but nothing like Life is Peachy and KoRn (self titled). If you like Follow the Leader and their mellow stuff pick it up, but if your like me and like harder stuff of KoRn then stay clear."
3,Nowhere as good as their first CD,"I don't see how many people can say this is a great album. From a true hardcore Korn fans point of view...they sold out on this album. Here are my reasons why-1. It took them on 5 months to write!2. Not as hardcore as the first cd.3. They are now enlisted in the ""TRL"" crowd.Don't get me wrong. I bought the cd the night it came out. But...I nearly burned it. I felt like it would be a waste of lighter fluid. Now I do understand from a guitarist's point of view to try something new, but only time will tell if they can do better on the next album.My advice: If your a true Korn fan buy this. But get the first album instead. It is truly on a whole different level of greatness."
3,"OK, could be better","This cd is ok if you don't like the real hard stuff. The cd is soft compared to the others and if KoRn wants to keep the fans they have there next album better be really good. There first cd is awsome but after follow the leader they have gotten soft. follow the leader was more of a rap based album, but issues was just too soft for me. The best songs on there is hey daddy, somebody someone, and make me bad, but othere than that it was a soft cd. I am a really big korn fan, but this cd was a disappointment. They can do better. peace!"
2,MOSTLY TRASH,"This album was horrible. It's dark soul metal, not what Korn is known for. Dead, Falling Away From Me, Trash, Beg For Me, Make Me Bad, Somebody Someone, Wish You Could Be Me, Counting, and Dirty deserve 4 or 5 stars, but the rest of the songs bring it all the way down to 2 stars. Korn, Life Is Peachy, and Follow The Leader, are all 4 or 5 star albums, but this one was mostly trash. Cop the other Korn albums, put the songs I mentioned onto a mix, then wait for the fifth Korn album. Buy this album if you like to eat dead rats and live under a rock in a desert in New York City."
5,"Raw, Blunt, Honest and Great","This cd, combined with both blunt, real lyrics, dealing with real issues, and the raw music with a sound that rocks, is definitely worth the $13 you will pay for it. They have matured since their cd, Follow the Leader, and have a sound that is the same, but with new lyrics and emotions empowered in their music. Get this cd if you like more hard core rock with lyrics that mean something, instead of fake words... (britney spears, ricky martin)"
4,Korn: Issues,"I've been reading a lot of the reviews and I've realized that most people are downsizing Issues because it's not ""hard"" enough or they're dying out. First off, you have to realize that each and every one of Korn's albums is about a different part in time or about a different experience. The self-titled was about childhood. Issues is a CD about Jonathan Davis's personal life i.e. the breakup of his marriage and such like that. I agree with some who didn't like the two extra short songs. It did hint that Issues was rushed since Follow The Leader was released in 1998 and Issues was released 1999. However, if you are willing to see the different sides of Korn, I suggest you add this to your collection. All in all, if anything, I'd say Korn has gotten better from their first album. The self-titled was very thrashy and it was especially hard to hear the lyrics. Korn has come a long way and I'm sure that they'll be in the music scene for a while."
4,! DIFFERENT !,"This is definately an acquired taste, after the first listen I wanted this to break into a million pieces, but after tolerating future listenings the grooves settled and the album picks up from there, as stand out tracks are soon identified (2,5,6,11,13)and you soon adjust to the new neo-metal sound of it. Still its not the best, as Im sure it needs more funk and hip-hop incorparated into the verses."
5,"Different, But it grows on you like a fungus on a tree","After Playing this album for the first time, I thought this sucks because I was use to the non stop in your face beats of Follow the Leader. After careful playing of this record I realized Korn had brought an Errie Mellow subdued undertones into its beat . Which turns out to be just as good as all the rest"
2,down and down we go...,Poor Korn. Once a band sells out that's it. You can't put the Genie back into the bottle. If you want to hear Korn at thier best get thier first album. If you want to get some good music check out Nothingface.
4,Really Good,"The cd came in really fast, it was in very good condition, and for an amazing price. The only problem was that it didn't come in the original case. It was most likely in the description. Other than that, im completely satisfied!"
4,"This started the experimental side of Korn, with mixed results..","I enjoyed this cd just like I enjoy all the other Korn cds. But it is one that I normally don't listen to straight through. There are some songs that I skip over. The really good songs, like ""Falling Away From Me"", ""Trash"", ""Make Me Bad"" and ""Somebody, Someone"" are great additions to the Korn catalog, but I find it hard to get into the other songs as much. None of the other songs are bad, it's just that I have so many other great Korn songs to listen to instead, and I prefer the heavier side of Korn from previous outings. It is worth buying just for those hit songs I mentioned, but don't expect another ""Follow the Leader""."
3,|3.7| Some of Korn's best work.,"At first, a lot of Korn fans got pissed off because of Issues' 'gothic, darker sound'. Issues is no doubt darker, heavier and flat out freakier than any of their other albums, and it is also one of their best. True, some of the tracks on the album are filler, and some just suck; however, some tracks are absolutely brilliant, and represent some of Korn's best work to date such as ""Let's get this party started"" or ""Somebody, someone"". I'm not particarally a Korn fan, however, I'm always up for some casual listening, and Korn definently provides entertainment. Just like in the other albums, Jonathan Davis is still whining and crying. It can get annoying, but I really don't mind as long as Korn keeps pumping out these nice riffs.Overall, Issues is way different and in my opinion, sometimes way smarter and well and crafted than their previous albums. Thumbs up."
5,BEST KoRn CD EVER,"I have listened to Every KoRn Album out there and i think that this one[ISSUES] and ""Untouchables"" are they're best they have really outdone themselves on this one the quality in which i enjoy most in this album is the EERIE feeling and uniqueness throughout. I think that the Best songs on this album are...""Dead"", ""Falling Away From Me"", ""4U"",""Make Me Bad"" and ""Hey Daddy"" I Would Reccomend this album if you like Weird New Age Music..Toodels"
2,Bad Album,"Dead: its short and very annoying, that bagpipes thing is just stupid now.Falling Away From Me: This song is horrible and embarrasing. Stupid vocals, stupid lyrics, and stupid message.Trash: Whiny vocals, but mildly tolerable.4U: Excellent song, but too short.Beg 4 me: Terrible song. Completely pointless.Make Me Bad: Best song on the album! Good lyrics, surprisingly great vocals! Actually its one of their best of their career.Its gonna go away: Short, fairly annoying interlude.Wake Up: Stupid lyrics, but actually the music itself really good.Am I Going Crazy: Short and pointless.Hey Daddy: Some good parts, but the chorus is stupid.Somebody Someone: HorribleNo Way: Somewhat Tolerable, still below average.Lets get this party started: Below averageWish you could be me: Horrible and EmbarrisingCounting: BoringDirty: Kind of repetitive."
4,I have issues,"If you like a combination of punk and heavymetal then you will like the new Korn album""Issues"". The best song on the album is ""FallingAway From Me."" Korn is famous for their violencein their songs and if you like violence then you willlike Korn's new album."
4,Not as good as the others but ok,"OK... so I love Korn and am very loyal to them, but I rarely listen to this CD and I feel bad. It is not as hard as any of the other CDs. My best friend and I are convinced it will grow on us."
4,This CD rocks!,"Eventhough I liked this CD, I think that Follow the leader had better songs like got the life, their single Falling away it's ok but songs like dead aren't that great...but it's your own judgement"
4,A step in the right direction,The new record is great...probably their best to date. It is dark and heavy yet the vocals are suprsingly melodic. There is actually some three-part harmony on this disc. I like this cd better than the last two.
4,It's another great korn cd,"I just got the new Korn cd ""Issues"" today and I'm really enjoying it a lot. I have all of koRn's other albums and this one fits in nicely. I think it's much heavier then Korn's last release ""Follow the Leader"". It a big more raw. Alot of it reminds me of the bands second release ""Life is Peachy"". It has some great riffs and songs on it. The songs that really stand out as new korn classics to me are ""Trash"", ""beg for me"", ""Wake up"", and ""Somebody someone"". Although all the songs are extremely good. I'm not sure it beat's Korn's first self titled release but it's very good.-Alex"
2,DOESN'T CLICK,"""issues"" frankly is just a cheesy follow up to follow the leader. i dont like either but i'd rather listen to FTL. i've been in love with korn for so long. but once i got issues, it just got away from me. the music sounds the same. its all whiny and they use tons of weird stuff to make jons voice different. ""falling away from me"" is the only good song on this album. there are many swears on it. i guess they think by putting more swears in will make it more like their first cd. i think not. korn is dieing, they have been. issues will sell well...but korn will never be the same. i think jon, has run out with ideas to sing about and he just repeats them in this album. sorry korn, im going to have to ""fall away"" from you."
4,best korn cd along with the original but still some flaws,"this cd is heavy, has monster beats and grat chorases but is dampered by filthy lirics (just listen to track #3) and bad guitar playing, (not that munky or head have ever been good.) It is also getting very old when they go from super heavy power chords to jonathan davis whining in a soft voice. But if you like korn this is the cd to buy."
1,a waste,"I must say, very disappointing. KoRn has gone downhill since their debut album, which I happened to enjoy. But they have never performed as well since then. And most people I know like the band just because they're KoRn. Definitely not worth the patience, time or money, buy Helmet's ""Meantime."" 5,000,000,000 times better than this."
2,For Korn addicts only!,"I remember the days when I'd get A.D.I.D.A.S and Blind stuck in my head for days on end. This usually lead to me using serious swear words in front of teachers, parents, etc. If you don't like getting catchy songs stuck in your head, this cd is for you, because it EATS IT. It really doesn't measure up to the other korn cds. Head was right on when he called it experimental. Still, my hard-core korn friend likes this cd, so who knows? I really like how the guys (from korn) posted some stuff on this page though, so I'm going to go out and buy ""Life is Peachy"" in their honor. (P.S., the new music video is a joke yo!)"
3,"ISSUES,GREAT CD?",RECENTLY I GOT THE KORN CD ISSUES. I LOVE KORN SO I WAS EXCPECTING THIS TO BE A AWSOME ALBUM. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T LOVE IT BUT ALL THE SONGS HAD THE EXACT SAME BEAT BUT IT WAS A GREAT CD AND KICKS BUT FOR KORN FANS EVERY WHERE. NOT AS GOOD AS LIFE IS PEACHY BUT A CLOSE SECOND.
3,Seems somewhat softer then previous albums.,"I have to begin by saying that even though I think that it's a tad softer then the previous albums, it's still a very good album. I really enjoyed Falling Away From Me , 4U , and Hey Daddy. Overall, the album is good but the change in sound is just a little bit dissapointing as I was hoping for another rock hard album like Life is Peachy."
3,Not as bad as people say it is...,"A lot of people say that this album sucked. A mojority of thos people were not Korn fans. If you are not a Korn fan you will probably not like this album. I actaully rate this album 3rd of all of Korn's album, and I am a Huge Korn fan. The one minute songs is what really influences people's opinions. I have to admit that yes they do kinda suck except for 4 U. That song actually is not bad especially live, I kinda wish they would've made it longer though. Falling Away From Me and Trash are my personal favorites. The rest of the songs the the album are o.k. The songs are not the best out there but they aren't the worst either. I would recommend this album to Korn fans only."
3,korn...loosing it or gaining it,"ok, i think this album wasnt so big, sure it was ok, but it was definatly lacking somehting. it had hits like ""make me bad"" and ""Hey daddy""but somehting was really lacking from there other albums.im not saying this album was bad, but it certainly was not the best. i enjoyed it a few times i listened to it but after a couple times through i put it on my cd rack and hadnt really taken it out much.but hey, its not totally bad, but compared to follow the leader and life is peachy and the self titled korn albums, it doiesnt measure.i say go out and buy the cd, then resell it on ebay after a couple months."
3,hhhmmmm,"I really don't know where to start with these guys.Number one, I'm not a big metal rock fan, but I got this c.d. at C.D. Warehouse for $3 just to give it a try.I first heard ""Falling Away From Me"" on South Park when Korn did the special apperance. I kinda liked the song.Then I got a taste of the album itself.""Trash"" isn't so bad. The talks about suicide are a bit much.""Wake Up"" is one of my favorite songs. Like when it calms down during the verses.And last but not least, ""Hey Daddy"" I can somewhat relate to.I must say, now I know why people kill themselves and go off the deep end. Music like this.But don't get me wrong, everyone gets depressed. Including the interludes, this album isn't so bad but this will be my first and last Korn album. Simply because there's only but so much I can take."
5,"kind of depressing, but I still love it!","In my personal opinion this is korns greatest album. Other people may not like it but this depressing cemetary music is perfect for me, even thohgh i'm not depressed. You shouln't listen to the reviews just try it you may like it."
3,not the best korn stuff,I would say this would be the worst korn album ever but it is ok. Songs like Wake Up and Beg For Me are probably their best songs. If you want a good korn Album buy the first one or follow the leader or untouchables
2,Worst KoRn CD,"I am a huge KoRn fan, but this CD was just plain bad. When I first got this CD,I thought it was okay, but once I listened to it again, it just lost it's flavor. Jonathan Davis barely screams on it, all he does is try to sing, which he was never that good at. Jon Davis has a great voice for screaming as shown on the first three CD's. In conclusion, from the corporate inside cover of the ""MTV Kover Kontest"" to the repetitive lyrics, this album is not KoRn."
1,and they sell it out to ..........MTV,"this once good band is no more. why you ask? because they SOLD OUT! this album along with ""follow the leader"" are depressing,morbid,etc. jonathan davis is a screamer NOT a singer half way in almost every song you will always hear him SCEAMING! the songs on this album alone are just about sucide. now it's ok if one album like one or two songs about it,but an ENTIRE album based on sucide makes me sick. what was jon thinking? most of the time he writes good songs but most of these songs don't fall under that catagory. the only truely good songs are ""falling away from me"",""make me bad"" and ""somebody someone"". other then that you might as well skip the rest."
5,Almost Perfect,"Korn don't seem to be so skilled on their instruments, but they're VERY SKILLED in songwriting though. All you have to do is to give the record some time to convince you that this is the best album ever made. My favorite song is trash. There's only one thing I don't like with this album, between some tracks they have some short songs that makes you press the next button. Why did they make those wierd songs between? The songs I mean are 4 u, it's gonna go away, Am I going crazy, Wish you could be me. So you could say that this is a 12 tracked album."
2,It's the same old thing,"Korn has put out 3 CDs of the same style. While this one is better than Life Is Peacy, it still can't touch their debut. The current single is the best song on here, you wouldn't miss much by skipping this entire CD."
1,"I got issues, not you","I got real issues with this piece of junk. for instance, why can't you spell your name right? I feel bad for anyone who is tortured with this album. Give up music and go back to farming"
2,not good,"I too am a Korn fan from the begining. The first and the thrid albums are very good, both 5s. This one is not worth the money and even more its not worth the time."
1,This is the sellout album from Korn,"Issues is a very poor album, and sadly the band has went from modern rock stars, to TRL Mallcore addias crap, Poor writing, dumber singing and stupid songs, let's face itKorn is dead and they will never come backDEATH TO FALSE METAL"
2,corney,"the beats are good, but the voice and the lyrics are pointless. if you get this your a weirdo."
3,What happened to orginal Korn,This cd is like dance music i can not see this as the same band that made life is peachy this cd actualy makes follow the leader look good it's worth buying but it's not one of those cd's you'll love
2,worst Korn album yet,"This album pretty much sucks! It only got 2 stars because it is Korn, other wise it would of got 0. I was so diassapointed with this cd, they used way too many effects on this album and Johnathan does nothing but whine. They will never top their debut album."
5,"Korn has ""Issues""...and they ROCK!","I've been waiting anxiously for Korn's new album, and I have to say that it ROCKS! The whole idea of four different covers was a cool idea, but I'm not one of those mega-fanatics who went out and bought all four. I chose between my two favourites. Anyway, about the music... the two most stellar tracks are ""Falling Away From Me"" and ""Trash"". This stuff sounds like early Korn, and I loved it! The rest of the album is awesome too, especially ""Make Me Bad"", ""Dirty"" and of course the intro, ""Dead"". Jon Davis' voice and the rest of the band make this a GREAT album and a must-have for all Korn fans! I'm extremely psyched with the new CD and I can't wait for the tour. Korn is definitely one of the greatest bands of this decade and they're gonna last into the new millenium! Thanks, Korn, for making November a GREAT month for me!"
2,What the hell?,"Huh? I suppose that I must have missed the point of Korn's new album. I loved their self-titled debut album, it represented the outward expression of the raw emotional pain we all feel in such a tangible way...but I don't have a clue what they are doing here. They shy away from their trademark crunch, instead choosing to have Davis howl over weird house of horrors style music. No track on the album possesses the intensity and power generally associated with KoRn. What the hell happened?"
2,NOTHINGLIKE THE OTHER CD'S,"I MUST SAY THAT I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW KoRn ALBUM ALTHOUGH, TO TELL THE TRUTH I DID NOT EXPECT MUCH SEEING AS HOW IT WAS LITTE MORE THEN A YEAR SINCE THE RELEACE OF FOLLOW THE LEADERCAME OUT. AND THAT IS WHY THIS CD AIN'T THAT GOOD."
1,Imitation CD,"Korn first caught my attention with the release of their first successful album, Follow The Leader. The style was new and inventive, adn the songs were great. However, this is not the case with Issues. They deliver almost an identical record to their first one with no major changes. Usually, with a recent release, you are able to see how the band has matured over their recent fame. It is clearly evident here that Korn threw in a duplicate of their first record in order to get everyone to buy it because it's by Korn. My reccomendation is if you don't have Follow the Leader, buy one or the other. Don't waste your money on two identical records."
5,A Great CD,"Issues is wonderful. Although its songs may be more melodic and slow, the rage of Jonathan Davis's vocals and lyrics isn't absent. In fact, Issues has the most deep and meaningful lyrics of all the Korn albums. I definently recommend this album. Some fans may say Korn became a ""sell-out"" band after Life is Peachy was released, but the truth is Korn only matured in their sound and brought something totally new to the table. Issues is a perfect example of how diverse Korn's songs can be. Also, all you Jonathan Davis worshippers out there (like myself) would like to know that Issues is probably the most personal album for the vocalist/songwriter. Many of the songs on Issues touch topics that were never discussed in earlier Korn albums, and I feel that Jonathan Davis let out all that he was holding back in this album. Pick up a copy of Issues and ignore all the nay-sayers. Korn's fourth album is a must have."
1,korns best album yet!,"Korns fourth albums issues is in my opinion their best yet. Here is a run down of the songs.1.dead-pretty boring, features bagpipes by jonathan Davis.-1/102.Falling away from me- the best song on the cd.also the first single on the cd-10/103.Trash-Good song, kind of a rap meets korn type song.-9/104.4U-this song just a stupid filler.-0/105.Beg for me-the drums in this song are good,so are the lyrics and guitars.-9/106.Make me bad.-This song is ok, it could have been better.-7/107.it's gonna go away-another stupid filler 0/108.wake up- ok song, ...6.59.Am i going crazy-a stupid filler.-0/1010.Hey Daddy- a cool song, theres some wierd but cool sound through out the song. 9/1011.somebody someone-this song is pretty good.-8/1012.No way-No comment.7/1013.lets get this party started-if tou like heavy songs this ones not for you.6/1014.wish you could be me- stupid filler15.counting-this song is heavy and has good drums.-9/1016.dirty- a stupid 7 minute song it s also the last on the cd"
3,Following the Lead? er....,"Well it's pretty good, but it's not the last album. I think it the songs (other than Falling Away from Me) will take time to grow on me."
3,"Godd, but better out there","This is a good CD and I have been a hardcore Korn fan for a long time, but Follow the Leader, and Life is Peachy are definetally better. It is no doubt about it better than most of the other trash out there, but the other Korn CD's are better"
2,issues ( korn ),"issues isn't as good as the first two korn cd's- korn,follow the leader. The first 5 songs are ok!.As myself (a big korn fan ) Darren Brennan!"
5,some of their best work,"This is some of KORN's best work, it takes a while to get to like it...but when you start, you wont stop. this album has rarely left my cd player, if you like KORN in any way, this is the album for you....plus any other korn album!! And then these idiots come on here and preach..""OHH, slipknot is an awesome band"", slipknot is a load of you know what. if there is nine of them, and they still sound that bad then i think they should give up on their ""musical carrers"""
4,Issues - The album for the public,"This album is very good except for the fact that there are 4 completely usleless filler tracks, and 10 potential singles. I can imagine every full length song except for Wake Up being played on MTV or radio. However, there are lots of good songs like Dead (Good bagpipes), Falling Away From Me, Trash, Beg for Me, Hey Daddy, and Let's Get this Party Started. Counting has some good riffs like those from self-titled or LIP. This is a good introduction to Korn, as is FTL."
5,Best Ever,"What a powerful cd. ""Somebody Someone"" sends off vibes so that u can actually feel it, and i actually like lyrics in their songs. ""Make Me Bad"" is a dark, grim, yet great. Why dont you people like this cd. This is Korns best, and I hope is stays this way"
1,El sucko delux,"this cd is a complete waste of time, money, and materials. in fact, i wish they had a negative star rating on this site. one star is far too generous."
1,Falling away from me...,"is the only good song on this album, others completely failed to hold my attention for longer than a day, 'wake up' sounded uplifting at first but it got too repetitive like the whole CD.Issues is just another one-track CD by another nu-metal band."
1,More like Creed than KoRn,"This CD decided to put more emphasis on better lyric writing than better music. Truth is, neither one of those things are better. This CD is almost killing their style from their previous records. And as for the lyrics, these are definitely the dumbest lyrics that have come our of his mouth. Download the song ""Trash"" and then ignore this CD. Unless KoRn redefines their style, I hope to not be hearing from them in a while. Hands-down worst KoRn CD.Favorite songs: Trash"
2,"Well, Not the best......","I personally think that this album is not the best by Korn. It is in a sense, a radical departure from FOLLOW THE LEADER. With some weird sounds and primitive lyrics. In my opinion the 1st album was the best. All because it came from the heart rather than a money making music CEO's mouth. Maybe Korn can learn from this and make a better album next time."
1,Why do you want to listen to unhappy music?,"why do you want to listen to unhappy music. stop trying to cram yourself into the steriotyped korn boshing angry teenager. listen to something happier, trust me, you'll be happier if your happy search Happy2bHardcore (no spaces) that's some good stuff, disk three is the best"
1,Read this,"Korn has sold out. I don't think Jonathan Davis is depressed anymore, but he might as well act like it so he can go and sell millions of records. Wise up, folks."
1,What Happened Korn?,"What happened? Do any of you remeber the good old days of Korn. The hard rocking head banging ones, and now, well, choirs, and orchestral music. It seems that Korn is taking the same road as many groups, and going for the soft pop landing. This CD is just 16 very bad songs. I really like korn, and I love it, but what is wrong with the guys down there? It all started with the Follow the Leader. If you guys want good music, bring back Ross Robinson, producer of tonnes of great records (the two first korn ones, and slipknot, coalchamber), all with a beat that changed the way the music industry though. If you want music, change to a heavier group, because this one is goin kapootz"
1,Korn sux,This cd is terrible. Ive never seen such a sellout band in my life. Korn has absolutely no talent at all and it shows on this cd. What dont they try actually playing their instruments? Instead they just make noise because they think their cool. If the members of korn are reading this i have a message for you...YOU SUCK! Anyone who has an argument feel free to e-mail me at the address shown above. Dont buy this cd.
1,Extreme Disapointment,"I used to love Korn, but this album was beyond awful. I'd like to keep this interview simple, so I'll make my main points now:Korn started off great, and got worse with every CD they released (no acceptions to the pattern). Their first album, the self-titled, is excellent and I would reccomend the purchase of it. ""Life Is Peachy"" is also a necessity, but it just about ends there. ""Follow the Leader"" is OKAY but nothing outstanding.There is ONE decent (not great) song on ""Issues."" It's called ""Let's get this party started."" Get the mp3, or put it on a mix if you want, but don't waste your money on the album for it."
1,"""Issues"" has Issues","A typical overhyped release. Obviously Korn believes fans will put up with the constant change in music style, unfortunately some fans do. This album is simply trash. Korn has potential but wastes it on trash like this. Don't get me wrong I do own and enjoy their self labeled release ""Korn"". It gave metal a new dimension. It kicked and really stayed heavy, something most metal albums don't do. But after the release of ""Korn"" everything went downhill. Six years with three albums worth of chances and Korn has gotten worse and worse. Even with their horrible music they have still held onto fans. Their lyrics of violence has turned their fans into pre-meditating murderers, or at least most of them. Just visit the Kornweb message boards. Anyway, this album like everyother korn release (Except for ""Korn"" their '94 self titled album)is a waste of money and listening time."
1,just one more point...,When the lead singer does that goofy gibberish doesn't he sound like Beavis' other side the great cornholio? I think he does...
4,very good!,"This cd are very cool.Some songs like Somebody Someone,Trash,Falling away from me. have heavy sounds.Is the second best cd of Korn.The first best is the first of the band. Someone say for the korn band for they come did a tour in south america.Korn have a legion of fans in every place of Brazil"
4,Quite a good CD,This CD is good but not that great.4 stars is the right rating.I agree with the other reviewers about the lyrics being shadowed by the loud music.They should have made the lyrics a little bit louder.
1,waste of money,"This cd is a total disapointment. koRn reached their musical peak with follow the leader and should have stopped afetr that cd. if you want to hear good koRn, buy any of their other cds."
2,John!.. What Happened!,"Ok it gets 2 stars. I like Korn.. I really really do. But I'msorry, I was not happy at all with this album. First of all, I realizethat a band must evolve and change, and with them, their music. However, I find that the music on this CD is not evolved at all, it is manufactured. It's like this, the first album is great, Life is Peachy was great too, follow the leader was my favorite, and Issues is, well, a disappointment. I guess the guys got caught up in the success and were in a rush. So they pumped out a sell out, ( ) rushed album. If you just love Korn, or perhaps buy music because other people think it's cool, this is a record for you. But if you actually like to 'listen', I don't think you'll be enjoying more than 2 or 3 songs. Sorry Mr. Davis. Spend a few more months next time. END"
1,Oh no..grow up!,"My friends like it because of Jonathan's painfilled voice. And cool riffs. But for me........no way. If you want pain and agony, Buy the Deftones or The Cure. These guys are so faked and commersialised, pretending to be so cool, i almost sick up. Their music has no possible meaning, since the don't put any effort at all making a new record. (What did it take? A month...two?) The embarresing is that kids buy their cool attitude. OK, their music CAN be listened to but it doesn't touch you, in any way!"
4,KoRn makes another future hit album,"When I first heard the cd, I thought ""What a waste of $14. Follow the Leader was 10 times better."" But as I listened to it more, I realized that I was expecting something more like Korns last album, which they didn't put out. That is a good thing. KoRn would get very boring and unoriginal if every album they put out was similair. This cd is not as good as Follow the leader, but is definately worth it. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
3,The last one i care!!,"ISSUES is the last album by KORN that i care...got some KORN classics like SOMEBODY SOMEONE, FALLING AWAY FROM ME and MAKE ME BAD, but ISSUEs really recriates the korn atmosphere in a bad way...the lyrics were always disturbing and totally sick, but on issues they really turn to a depressive mood that i really don't like...the korn sound on every song is very similar, but on their debut and on LIFE IS PEACHY they were totally brutal, insane and raw...on issues they really incorporates some eletronic beats and some rap crap attitude....what can i say, i'm not a big KORN fan, but i like their debut, life is peachy and some songs on FOLLOW THE LEADER...they TOTALLY lost their way on issues..."
2,This is why...,"Alot of younger Korn fans don't get it when people call Korn ""nu-metal"" or say that they sound like pop.Although I agree that Korn have always been poppy nu-metal, they have always balanced it out with some very well done heavy tracks. Not so on Issues. This sounds like something Creed would write.""Make me Bad"" is trash. This song is the absolute *perfect* example of nu-metal pop-rock. Seriosuly, remove the deep bass sound and what are you left with? A Nickelback song, that's what.Korn jumped the shark in a big way with this album."
3,pretty good,I think issues is not bad but korn's new album just doesn't sound as good as their self titled debut don't get me wrong i like issues it is just some songs are just to light and some sound really weird best songs on the cd is falling away from me and counting so if your a korn fan you may or may not like it i thought half was good and half sucked but that is just my opinion but you be the judge for yourself
3,I rushed out to buy this the day it came out but...,"when I got home and listened to it I said wow I thought this cd would be much better! Then I listened to it again ans the songs grew on me. KoRn has yet again come up with a new sound and it is good, but the songs are just not as good as in the other CD's. This CD is deeper than the last 2, and more like the first on. The more I listen the better the songs become. I really love tracks 2 and 6 ""Falling Away From Me"" and ""Making me Bad"" they are awewsome! I liked Follow The Leader better, but this on is good, too"
5,"This CD is wonderful, to say the least.","KoRn first of all is just the best, I mean they rule! Their 1st CD KoRn waz the best then came Life Is Peachy, and lastly Follow The Leader in that order, the order of the ones that I think are best. When I heard about Issues I knew that it was going to be great. Jon Davis said that it was more like their 1st CD and it was so totally true. I love that CD it is the best."
4,its pretty good....,this cd is much better then follow the leader because this cd is not rap influenced like FTL. This cd is like their first album which i think is their best cd out because they dotn use all those special effects like in FTL. but overall this cd is pretty good
2,disappointing,"After reaching there peak with Follow the Leader,Korn brings in a rather lame follow up with no memorable songs with the exception of Falling away from me and maybe Trash. Other than that I found this record to be sad and disappointing"
4,"The Music Is Great, but The Lyrics Are Terrible.","I Honestly like the guitar sounds and the voice effects. But, I really think the lyrics are horrible.Such as in,""Wish You Could Be Me"": At least you could look at me, while you are ripping me. Who's ripping Jonathan Davis?""No Way"": Felling like I'm God. Does he fell like God?""Falling Away From Me"": Do they really flirt with suicide?""Let's Get This Party Started"": Is He really insane?These kinds of lyrics make me worried about how their lives are gonna be. Should we help them?"
5,KORN COMES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE,"OH MY GOD...this cd is sweet, Korn doesn't go away from their typical sound but now it goes beyond anything done on follow the leader....a worthy purchase to end the millenium and next millenium IT'S GONNA BE ROCK ALL THE WAY..!"
4,It's Different,It's defenitly not follow the leader part 2. so if thats what you're looking for keep looking all in all it's a very good cd. diversity is turning in to one of korns trademarks theres a little bit for everyone on this one
5,have you ever walked the streets of bakersfield,Ok first i gotta say korn kicks ... Issues is awsome. It doesn't reach the power of self tittle but its their second best. This cd takes u through the mentality of johnathan and some of it actually has a positive messege. Songs like wake up speak such true words. In my opinion the whole cd is great but korn does need to get back to basics to be able to top their first cd. I would recommend buying this cd. HOWEVER DON'T COMPARE TO OTHER KORN CDS! Issues is original and is a great korn cd.
5,Korn still rocks,"Okay, let's get this straight. Korn is obviously a band who tries different and new things. On each album, they have made a new style of music. Issues is no exception, and any Korn fan would know that. I've really enjoyed their music since their first album but this album is my favorite CD of theirs. It is different from the other three but I think that somehow it defines jonathan davis's personality and all the crap he goes through. That's why I gave it five stars."
5,OVER HERE FIELDY!!!,"Well this is cool. Unless that artist comment by Fieldy is fake and was made by somebody else, this is cool.Frankly, KoRn, if u read this, this album was awesome. You have created even a newer new sound, newer than your selftitled was. The songs are great. The only complaint I have is the quantity. I was slightly disappointed that there were really only 10-11 songs on this album and the rest were cool but short interludes. The length went to 53 minutes. If you took your style and made an album that was maybe 70 or 79 (the limit) minutes long, you would have, to put it plainly, your best album.Keep up the good work.Now, this is for the people who wonder whether or not they should buy this album:Don't listen to these hypocrites who just want to put you down and keep you from buying this CD. I highly recommend it. MAKE ME BAD and SOMEBODY SOMEONE are explosive. If you're still unsure then listen to some samples."
4,A book about twins that doesn't have research,"It was refreshing to read a book about twins that wasn't all research and statistics. This book tells a short story about the lives of twins that are either famous or have accomplished something extraordinary or stick out in some other way. Notables are Muhammad Ali's twin daughter, the Hennessy's, Tamera and Tia (Sister Sister show), Mario Andretti and his twin Aldo and Jane Seymour's twin boys. Also the story of the Jim Twins (in every book about twins) and the famous Hensel conjoined twins.Very interesting reading, and I agree it's a good coffee table book. I do think they should have more boy-girl and other fraternal twins sets represented though."
5,Why aren't there any books about twins?,"As the owners of a Web site about twins and supertwins, that was a question that we received regularly in e-mail messages from around the world. It is easy to find books for parents about raising twins, but there just weren't any books about twins, their lives, and the special relationship that exists between them.Now, we're pleased to be able to answer that question with an enthusiastic ""Yes. There is!""And, ""Twins"" is a wonderfully inspirational, beautiful book that is a ""must have"" for any one who is a twin, knows a twin, or is just interested in learning more about what it means to be a twin.The photography is absolutely wonderful (we strongly urge the publishers to follow the book with a calendar). The essays by Ruth and Rachel Sandweiss are written with an understanding that could only come from a ""twin perspective.""If you know a set of twins, why not buy two copies? This is the ultimate gift."
5,Simple truths for young people about Witchcraft.,"The modern media biases against witchcraft are pleasantly missing from this book. Fear and hatred of Witches may be avoided if this book is presented to children as an early introduction to witchcraft and Magic. It is basic, yet interesting. Oh, and despite the appearance of the people on the cover, it is a friendly book."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have two books by Liz Rigbey and hope the other one will be better.This one is way too slow to keep me reading. After 100 pages I gave up.A complete waste of time.I rather recommend books that are thrilling from the first page like ""In a Dry Season"" by Peter Robinson, ""A Place of Execution"" by Val McDermid, ""Night over Water"" by Ken Follett, ""Landscape of Lies"" by Peter Watson, ""Tom Ripley"" by Patricia Highsmith or ""The Unforgiven"" by Patricia MacDonald."
3,Several characters stand out as people I'd like to meet.,"What I enjoyed most are the characters in the story whose personalities and quirks persisted to the end. I liked especially those who stood on the sidelines such as the bubbly Kim; the librarian, Mrs. Cleaver, who would sneak out for a smoke; the honorable Dr. Berlins; the ready-to-help Candice and the peculiar Nose. The children of Lomax were also endearing, as well as Deputy Dawg. However, Julia remained cold throughout and I could not empathize with her miseries and loneliness even at the end. I know that there is a connection with Lomax' resolution of his earlier suspicions regarding Dr. Berlins that contributed to his change in the end but I could not really feel it the way I wanted to. I think that there should have been more in the final confrontation between Lomax and Julia."
1,they doesn't fit. I bought these lights to replace the original lights in a dodge ram 2500 2007 pick up truck.,"I took the original bulb out of the socket and try to replace it with the one's supplied and they doesn't fit at all. Some one told me to cut some plastic in the base so they'll fit, but i just put again the original bulb. i'm very disapointed.I rate it one star because it cant be rated cero stars."
2,Definitely Out-dated,Pros:- Don't need to open the antenna to get reception...so it stays streamlined to the edge of your PC Card slot. That is the only positive of this card.Cons:- the driver software is WAY outdated. Even the software on 3com's site doesn't help.- Doesn't pair well.- Class II card...bad range.Go with a CLASS I type card. I purchased a Hawkings Tech Class 1 USB dongle. It is awesome. However I am now purchasing a Zoom Class I card which looks great and from what I heard might be the best.
2,Far inferior to the already overrated original.,"Despite the wonderfully perverse sex scene at the end this film is barely worth watching.Wordless for the first 19 minutes the film opens with the graphic suicide scene from the ending of part one. We then get 8 horrible, boring minutes of a woman digging up a grave. She takes the guy from part one home and makes boring love to the corpse. The film goes on like this until she meets a new guy (he's alive by the way). They go to the theater and watch a long, meaningless film about birds. They go to the zoo and to the fair and I nearly went to sleep.The live guy is fond of the girl but senses something is wrong when he finds a chopped off wang in the refrigerator! More stuff happens including an intensely graphic dissection of a seal then finally the sex scene that almost...almost...makes this art house snoozer worth watching.Look for a cameo by Buttgereit on the left side of the screen in the movie theater."
1,"Not Taboo, Ta-boring Is More Like It","I've read a lot of reviews for this film, and picked up both films from a store in the city after just being curious and looking to add to my horror collection. I enjoyed the first film very much, but this one is just terrible. I heard it was nowhere near as good as the first, but i didnt expect it to be THIS BAD.Just as others have said, there are a bunch of pointless scenes where nothing is being said or done. The first sex scene with the corpse is long, not shocking and just plain boring. This is supposed to be taboo i guess, but it really just puts you to sleep.I know the director wanted to do something different and not just rehash the first film, but it could have been so much better. If you edit out the few gore sequences, its more like a boring date movie than anything else.If you can find the find the first one, pick that up. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this snoozefest."
3,Disturbing to say the least,"All the reviews I read about this movie were pretty much dead on. This is the most depressing and disturbing movie I've ever seen. I've seen a multitude of horror-gore movies in my time(35+years) and considered myself unshockable, but this movie proved me wrong. I've watched it once and have no desire for another viewing. Watch it if you feel you need to as I did, but I imagine once will be enough."
3,washing machine valve,"Ordered these because of the color handle and the 90 degree bend. Ended up not using them because of the straight thread, a pipe thread would be better."
1,I never got the book,"I never got the book you sent. Some how it must have gotten lost. Or some other guy named Robert Greene got the book and thought, wow someone sent me a book. Oh well"
1,Beware of handwash only!!,"Very dissapointed. I loved the look of this until I realized that it is hand wash only. The plate after only a few uses has tiny cracks in the glaze. I also doubt it can be used in freezer or oven. When doing dishes the other day walked away from the sink with the plate still in it, upon return the water soaked into the plate discoloring it.This was one of the first pieces that I bought to be made in China. To me the quality is not the same as the pieces made in the USA. I try to buy only American made pieces when I can. If made in China I inspect it very closely."
4,Hetty,"Very different from a Poirot, Lewis, frost etc. in terms of how she ends up solving/wrapping up mysteries. Some of it appears as luck and others make you go back and watch the episode to catch what elements made her conclude the way she did, which is fun because you do catch things that you missed! Hetty is, also, more of a character that ordinary people can connect with. Plus, the relationship that the main three characters, Hetty, Jeffery and Robert, have a lot of good chemistry and silly moments. I find this series a nice and pleasant one to enjoy with family."
2,slim plots,"Acting is well done. Patricia Rutledge is always good. However the plots are lacking. I was looking for something more complex,a mystery. These are not the ones. They improved as the series progressed. I did like the character development."
3,"Patricia, Yes! Writing, meh!","I am a fan of Patricia Routledge and the comedy in which she excels in Keeping Up Appearances. She does well in her acting in this series too, as do all her supporting actors and actresses. Yet the plots are weird. More than once I've found myself as the final credits unexpectedly roll, saying to myself ""That's it? THAT'S the end of the episode?"" The conclusions come so quickly and abruptly they can almost be parodied. Where's the conclusion? How EXACTLY did Hetty solve this?There are many interesting settings, but the writing just isn't up to the quality one might find in Midsommer Mysteries, The Last Detective (though the dialogue is near impossible to understand at times in that one for an American), A Touch of Frost, Rosemary and Thyme or my favorite Foyle's War, which is head and shoulders above the rest."
5,Hyacinth calmed and great fun,"Great fun. Patricia Routledge is a joy in whatever role she plays, and this one is just right for her. None of the slapstick of Keeping Up Appearances but plenty of humor and physical hijinks."
3,We didn't enjoy it.,"Big fan of The Wiggles but this one did not interest my three year old. A lot of the scenes are shot from above looking down and it just seemed hard to focus on what was going on. As others said it is shot in one location and as usual Anthony does try to hog the show. So we would say pass on this one and get Pop Goes the Wiggles, The Wiggles Go Bananas, Sing a Song of Wiggles or You Make Me Feel Like Dancing."
2,Back to the basics.,"Our kids watch something from the Wiggles every day, whether it be from their TV show or from one of our many Wiggles DVD's. Naturally, we added this one to our collection. So imagine my surprise to see how uninspiring this production turned out. The whole show was stuck in a small circular stage, and the colorful circus atmosphere clashed with the black starry backdrop and polka-dotted black floor. The songs were rather bland. They did the same gymnastic numbers as they did on their other recent DVD release, ""The Wiggles: Big, Big Show!"". And at times, the camera was 10-feet high and you would be looking down on the Wiggles at an awkward camera angle. This is nothing like their computer graphic enhanced DVD's, ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" and ""The Wiggles Go Bananas!"". It's more basic than ""Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party"", and that's going way, way back. I hate to do it, Wiggles, but I have to give it 2-stars. Here's hoping the next DVD production turns out better."
4,Very enjoyable read,I thought this book was well written and not 'over your head'. I enjoyed the case studies and found them particularly enlightening. I recognized myself in a few of the descriptions.
3,Average to Better than Average Writting-Bad Test Engine,The test engine left something to be desired. I normally utilize the test engine to evaluate if I'm ready to take an exam or learn where my shortcommings are. The review software just didn't measure up....
1,Get the Sybex version instead,"This book was horrible. After using it, I failed the test by 16 points. I got the Sybex book and then passed the test by 109 points."
1,This book will not help you pass the Exam!,"I read this book, took the exam and failed it. I re-read the entire book, knowing what was expected on the exam, and failed it again! This book may have detailed information on IE and the IEAK, but it does not prepare you for the IE4+IEAK exam. It conveniently skips over the items asked on the test. Find another book if you intend on taking the test!"
1,too confusing and out of date,"This book is a complete waste of time. It is extremely confusing, with grids of information that don't really tell you any significant information about the apartment besides the price and year that it was sold. Since real estate fluctuates significantly from year to year, prices from 3 years ago will not do anyone any good. There are not a lot of recent sales recorded in the book. While the rental guide has some useful information, the sales guide is basically just capitalizing off the success from the rental guide, but does not even offer the small benefit that the rental guide does. Unfortunately, you will probably end up having to pay some sort of broker fee anyway, so why not start with a broker and at least have them do the work for you. As a buyer in New York, you don't pay the broker any way."
3,Full Disclosure?,"Well it wasn't a ground breaking film and I was a little confused on where Brian Palmer was going with this. It did have some graphic things in it but so do most of the videos on Youtube. So the title doesn't give it justice. It was also very short. C'mon Brian, I know you had tons more footage. I know because I was there. It was interesting to watch my unit in action. SSGT Marino is the man. A true warrior and honorable Marine. I'm glad I had the opportunity to serve with him along with all the other Marines that were there with me. Funny how I stumble across this. I may have saw myself in the background once or twice. I can't remember if Brian interviewed me or not. I do remember I thought he was working for MTV. Anyway back to the film. Like I said, could have been done better but was still an interesting watch. Brought back a lot of memories both good and bad. Semper Fi."
5,A great Combination,This is a great combination for white chocolate lovers. The crisp wafer along with white chocolate is a nice change from milk chocolate.
2,picture doesn't represent what was delivered,"the picture of this item shows stitching and a button on the lid. The item I received yesterday is plain on top with a few creases in the leather from where it had been folded before and isn't very appealing. Be careful opening the box in case you need to return it like myself. Otherwise, it's seems to be built well and sturdy with a lot of space inside for storage."

5,"Great product, great price","We have a beach front place, so maybe I could just look out the window, but I got a tide clock and liked it so much that I wanted a watch. My kids searched for 24 months to find this one.As with most products the instruction book could be better, but once I figured out how to set the tides for our beach and to get the right display it has been great.The watch can be reset when you vacation to another beach and keep track of two different beaches at once. The built-in chronograph is useful for jogging or timing a scuba dive... now if it just had a depth gauge...Very satisfied."
3,"Oh, The Clothes!","As a movie, it's not great. Amusing to watch once on late night tv but that's it. I would give it 2 stars - one for Sophia who's fabulous and the other because it is mildly funny. But I gave it three and suggest you buy it for one reason only: The Clothes.OH Those GORGEOUS Clothes! Yes there are many historical films out there with tremendous costuming (Anna and the King, GWTW, The Ten Commandments, etc.) but for a non-historical film showing contemporary clothing this is simply the best. Don't get me wrong, I am awed by Adrian, and enjoy watching Edith Head's designs come alive on screen but this is the best film for costuming and clothing EVER.Yes, yes it's not a reason for a film buff to buy it. But if you're studying fashion design, or are a clothing historian or just want to kick back one night and fill your head with scrumptious eye candy, this is it."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but there's always Sophia","This is a very slow-paced comedy with very few smiles. But anytime you have Sophia, it's not a total loss. However, this DVD print looks like it was made from an old bad print. The color is very faded and the sound is of static quality. A very disapponting DVD."
5,Classic Brady Bunch!,"Five stars of course!Season 1-3 are very traditional, Carol is much more husband and children centered.She is often helping to cook or sewing. She has her original haircut.They are all so great, you can't go wrong with this if you likethe show!"
4,Some episodes blurry,"The content of these shows are very entertaining and just good clean fun. The one thing about this particular box set that I didn't like is that several episodes were actually blurry. At first I thought it was MY eyes, but the kids started noticing too. Not all episodes are like this, but at least 3 or 4 are."
4,Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!,"Yes this is the season where Jan spouts that infamous line. This is also the season the Bradys have their ""Grand Canyon Adventure"" and as ""The Brady 6"" they record ""Time to Change"" in the wake of Peter's voice changing.24 episodes in all on 4 discs. Paramount did a good job with these. The prints are nowhere near as bad as some customers here are making them out to be.One minor quibble: This season set omits the opening ""THE BRADY BUNCH in color"" slides. I remember them being used for all 5 seasons and they were included on the first and second season sets so why not on this set?I also don't like the fact that Paramount (for some strange reason) decided to omit the cast boxes that appear near the end of each episode just before the ending tag comes up that leads into the ending credits. This is done on all three Grand Canyon episodes. What was the point? When something is sold as ""The Complete...."" I really expect it to be just that: COMPLETE."
1,Grand Canyon Episodes Edited!,The final moments of each Grand Canyon episode cuts omits the Cast Boxes.....these are classics....why are they cut?
1,knockoff,Very poor quality knockoff product... some unplayable or duplicates. Plus took almost a month to arrive. Cou;d only get a partial refund. Very bad deal
3,Missing Episode?,"The new third season box set says complete season, however episode 65-Law and Disorder is not included. Anyone have any information on this? I think the packaging is misleading,because it says complete third season all 23 episodes, but there were 24. Disapointed!"
3,"Needs a gadget, too many ads in the front","This workout is supposed to be done using a special oblong ""core ball"" (which Hart sells). This needs to be mentioned in the product description.Most of the exercises could be worked using perhaps a soccer-type ball (if you're not too heavy). Two of the exercises, the Mermaid and the Diamond push-up, she does with the ball, but you'd get a better workout not using the ball--it is used here as more of a support, rather than as a way to make the exercise more effective. Indeed, since it is oblong, rather than round, I think it is not as effective as using a round ball, since there is a lot less need to balance on it.Another negative with this DVD is that there is over a minute of ads you can't forward through at the beginning. Plain annoying, especially when you're in a hurry to get to the workout.Rent first, before buying."
3,unforgivable production values,"I really like the program itself - combines tai chi, yoga, and pilates to give a non-intensive yet solid workout. I simply can't get over, however, how truly awful this production is... Obviously originally a videotape, the resolution is horrific and the soundtrack is occasionally off. Worse yet, she's wearing a lav mike, and every time she turns to the side the volume dips or drops out altogether. I mean, how much is a boom mike for god's sake? On a workout video?! My 10-year old could have done a better job on the menu graphics... This program is far too expensive to have cheaped out on these details."
2,t tapp total workout,I returned item. too advanced for my needs. still no credit issued on credit card. not enough detail about product to assure ordering the appropriate item
5,One of my my favorite movies....,"EVER! Just a delight from beginning to end. It keeps you laughing throughout the entire movie. Want a good laugh? Something to distract yourself? Well, enjoy this movie!"
3,Cool book,"I have this hymnal at home and while it contains many latin hymns and mas settings from the Trindentine Mass,it lack some of the traditional english hymns such as Come Holy Ghost,Imacculate Mary,Holy, Holy, Holy etc. But still a good buy."
3,not real happy,product ok I did not get what i ordered but I am getting reimbursted for missing idems.
3,Choose It for the Songs You Recognize,"I own several CDs in this series and this one, unfortunately is the one that comes off the shelf the least. Even since loading the contents up MP3 style into my computer and iPod only a few get played. Only a select few truly sound like the alternative radio I grew up with in the 80s."
1,Yawn,"To be honest, I didn't make it all the way through the dvd. I found it boring. Some of the short stories were interesting in parts, but didn't hold my interest long enough for me to care one way or the other about what was going on. I'd give it a lower score, but there aren't negatives as options."
3,"Clever, entertaining, diverse.","If you want lots of erotica, this will disapoint. However, this collection contains humor, thoughtful connections, drama, and a sort of avant garde feel of diversity. The filming isn't Hollywood with its millions, but that doesn't necessarily take away from the entertainment value. Worth the price of a used DVD!"
3,"some fun, some interesting...","movie titled ''Interview with my next girlfriend'', very funny, others somewhat interesting."
2,Gayle R. Donham,I expected much more out of this film.The title is a bit misleading.There was basicaly nothing to watch.
2,Contrived and often trys too hard,A collection of stories which are short on substance and high on marketing. Found them trivial overdone repeated themes of past shorts and films.
1,"OK, but films should not just be OK","These shorts were short on substance and script...A nice set up but not worth over one star...If you want to see a good lesbian flick go buy ""A Family Affair"" or the old classic ""desert hearts"" or Sayles film ""Lianna"" Those films are more worth your money if you buy anything..."
2,Its is OK,"It is OK not too bad, but I do not want to pay for OK...this is a rental...nice cast over acting and writing is stilted...nice effort....hopefully their next project will be better...there was potential there"
2,was very dissapointing!,i was very dissapointed from this DVD i bought.i think it's not worth the money.it's a pretty old collection of short lesbo movies which i allready have seen the last 5 years in differet occasions.very dissapointing.
5,as good as ever!,"Just fine, except I feel bad that their website does not recognize my purchase, especially since there's no deal though Amazon."
3,interesting,"This is a very interesting product - the trick really is to be patient AND hold the wand downward (pointed exactly as if you just pulled it out of the bottle). Let the excess solution drip off and while keeping the wand in the same position, blow! The bubbles really do last a long time (overnight if left undisturbed). They really don't smell like PB, but they do last as promised."
2,VERY small bottle for the price!,"Our dog liked catching the bubbles (whether they actually taste good or not I don't know), but the bottle you get is so tiny! We paid $6 and the bottle fits in the palm of my hand...and I'm a girl so my hands aren't that big. They are longer lasting than regular bubbles, but all of the ones I blew popped within a minute or two. I'd buy these again if I found them at the dollar store, but not from here or for more than a buck."
3,hardly any,"You get very little actual soap. I've got to learn how to make this myself. One dog loved them, the other could have cared less. The bubbles last forever. One bubble stayed for so long, I finally just popped it. I wouldn't spend so much for such a small amount again, though."
2,My dog wasn't interested,My dog didn't seem to enjoy the bubbles which is strange because she is very curious about everything. The wand to blow the bubbles is really tiny and difficult to get out of the bottle.
4,Great!,"These bubbles were great. They worked very well and our dog had a blast with them. A little messy though. They are much thicker than normal bubbles and are sticky. We had to wipe our dog down afterwards because they were caked in this coat, kind of gluey. But it was worth it cause he had a blast with them and they produced great bubbles."
3,crazy dog catch a bubble,"Average product at best. The bubbles don't really stay in the air long, then leave this sticky residue after they land."
2,My dog could not care less for the bubbles...,"all he wanted to do is sniff the bottle of bubbles! He didn't pay any attention to the bubbles sitting all around him, on the floor, desk, shoe, anything they landed on, they just sat there looking pretty! These would be EXCELLENT decorations for a party, shower, or centerpiece for holidays or birthdays, because they do last a LOOOOONG time, but MY DOG did not find them very interesting. I'll give them to my nieces."
1,doesn't taste like peanut butter,"My terriers have always liked bubbles. When they were so unintested in these, I wondered if maybe they were losing their eyesight and couldn't see them, but when I tasted the solution myself, it was worse than regular soap bubbles. It does blow a lot of bubbles, though."
5,The best yet,"I hope when I'm 68 and in a wheelchair I can perform like Peg did on this CD. If you like the blues, this is the one."
2,"Some ""Assembly"" Required","I purchased 4 of these wands, and was shocked when they arrived. The electronic parts had not been soldered to the board! I wasn't sure if it was worth trying to get a refund or not, but I definitely wanted to warn other buyers. I happen to have a friend who was willing to give it a try for me. He spent a couple of weeks practicing and working on them and he got two of the four working for now. I didn't see it listed that it would ship that way. I might have missed it, or it might have been an accident, but heads up to future buyers."
1,old man goya,"This is a superficial and self-indulgent approach to both the subject (Goya), his art, Spain and Spanish history. Full of factual errors, it also is full of non-sequiturs, vague statements and strangely unconnected self-reflections. A huge disappointment."
2,Doesn't work,"This is supposed to be part biography, part personal recollection. Part fiction, part non-fiction. In prose but poetic. However Blackburn does not pull any of this off. The book provides some fluffy overly-poetic imagery of Goya (some of which IS memorable) but not much more. It reads quite self-indulgently too. The part biography part personal story might have worked in principle given the right style - in practice it hasn't.Might have made a good poem but it's not a good book."
5,The shoes are light and comfortable,"I love these shoes especially when I walk an entire golf course. They are light and comfortable; they give good support. When swinging the club, I feel good traction. I totally recommend these shoes."
5,a tool that all nurses in all cultures must know and use,"This book from L. W. appears to make a tremendous diference in the way nurses and health professional ca understant, and feel prepared to act as a healers not only for the body, but for the complet person, because D.W. make us understant the spirituality,and suffereing are both tangible and intangible aspects that must be in consideration of those that want to be really a resource for healing process in moments and lyfe experiences were one have to go deep to find meanings for the strugle and the sense of it is possible to overcame.I recomend this book for NURSES ALL OVER THE WORLD and working in all the possible contexts."
5,"Bought it to replace a more expensive model, successfully!","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, who once told me he had owned a similar Gerber multi-tool. Only this one had a few ""greater"" features- like the replaceable Carbide cutting blades! He said he really likes the slide-down pliers, instead of having to fold the handles around. Also, it's a lot more convenient that each tool folds down separately and without having to move one to reach another, etc. Personally, I thought it was neat they included the hex key, that had a little loop to keep it inside the sheath along with the tool itself. It's still a little heavy, but nothing he won't keep in his pocket!"
4,Gerber 07530 MP 600,"I first bought this model MP from Gerber back around 1995 and it was one of the best purchases ever for a Gerber product. I purchased a couple more through the years to replace lost ones and to have the ""back-up one"" with me. As of lately, I have had mixed feelings about the tool. The metal seems slightly thinner on the tools, the long blade has been replaced by a different type of blade (this I did not like a all...), and the option on the wire cutters is interesting. I have to purchase additional cutters?? Overall, it is a great tool to have for every day use or in a pinch."
5,daily wear,I use this every day at work and at home. I keep it on my belt and it just works. made in the USA
2,Don't buy it.,"This is the SECOND cool pad I've had that has ripped at the seam. I did not move it much nor was it abused in any way. If you would like for this to last longer than one summer, you will be disappointed."
2,My problem with the item...my suggestion,I didn't have any problem with receiving the order.My problem happened the 1st day. I put the mat down and my dog bit a hole right through it!Mty suggestion would be to put a cover over the mat so it won't tempt the dog to chew on the plastic. Dogs like to chew plastic things.
1,Reeks like chemicals,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
4,raw coconut oil at a good price,"I was afraid to order after reading the one negative review, but I thought maybe they had gotten better over time. I usually order the Aloha Nu, which is raw and has a strong smell and flavor of coconut, but they have been out of stock for a long time and may no longer be available.I have also gotten the Barleans 16 oz coconut oil which tastes the same as this Wilderness Naturals. I wanted to get a larger size at a slightly more reasonable price. The Wilderness Naturals is definitely fresh and arrived quickly in a well sealed gallon bucket. It also clearly states that it is raw (the Barleans does not) as well as being centrifuge extracted, so it's the real deal. It has a very mild coconut smell and flavor, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five. I will definitely buy this again if I still can't get the Aloha Nu."
5,Did a good job of mounting my light fixtures overhead.,"I needed to suspend some light fixtures for a garage we just built and this chain was just whatwas needed to do the job. It made a neat and strong installation on some high bay floursenct lightfixtures for our new garage. I was able to hang about 6 fixtures with about a half a roll, economicalinstallation."
3,A high quality book ...,"...much as you would expect from Charles Reid. For me, this book seems less focused than some of his earlier output -- such as his portrait & figure painting books and his portait video -- and less compelling, as was his floral book, although I suspect they might both appeal more to a female viewer/reader. It is also possible that there is a certain amount of repetition/overlap/familiarity about the book. That said, the color and quality of the images are admittedly wonderful and superior to the mainly mono-tone portrait book mentioned previously."
3,Book for watercolorists,"May be the author wished to speak about painting in general, but the pictures shown are mainly watercolors. So if you are interested in oils... Moreover Reid's oil paintings seem to me like watercolor ones, and his oils are not specially beautiful.Another important fact about this book is Reid's painting philosophy: ""I know I see a spot of (let's say) white color there, but I know the local color of this object is (let's say) blue, so I paint it blue"". In my opinion he just paints the tones and values he wants, with no relationship to reality. This is the way the title of this book should be interpreted.The paintings shown on the book are beautiful (I mean I like them), the explanations are clear (for me) and the examples are illustrative (I find them so). But I don't like the way he changes the light and atmosphere of scenes."
3,I think....,"that Dvesti Po Vstrechnoi is better. Sorry, but the girls were better with Shapovalov as they had someone to listen and follow. Now on they're own, there is no coordination."
1,too expensive!!,It is unneccessarily long and very [pricey] for an ordinary reader. It contains lots of repetitions. It could have been much shorter. I don't think it is worth [$]!!
1,caveat emptor,"buyer beware,i purchased this series from crazyape at a great price.the only problem,is that, what i received was not the title that is advertised.seller and amazon were notified ,but it's still advertised as the walter cronkite series.unprofessional and deceptive company."
1,chopped off HEAD!,"So far I've only looked at HEAD out of this box and I'm very sorry to report that the new widescreen transfer chops off... heads! If you go to 54 seconds, in the background you'll see the top of a guy's head cut off. At 42 seconds in on the Rhino dvd you'll see that his whole head is in the frame. And there's only a minimal amount of extra information on the sides of the Criterion frame as compared with the Rhino version. There appears to be much more loss to the top and bottom than is gained on the sides.Yes the picture has been cleaned up but the framing is all wrong. It looks like they matted and zoomed in on the frame just to give us widescreen."
5,Stunning!,"The quality of each film, both sight and sound, are stunning. American cinema at its finest reflecting the raw and gritty times they were made."
5,"Zan & Jayna, not Wendy & Marvin","Despite the cover, Zan and Jayna are the kids in these stories. My 3- and 6-year old son and daughter love this book. We took it with us on a 6 hour drive to Disneyland and it kept them both entertained for a good portion of the drive. My only gripe is the original covers are only shown at the end of the book and are rather small."
4,so-so toy if no baseball-football feild,"this toy is so-so if you don't have a baseball or football field because it has a little problem where it always turns to the left. all times i tried to ground launch it spun out but a hand launch is fine, if your in a big field fun toy, will review again after baseball-football field try-out"
2,"Fun to fly, for about 15 minutes...","The best thing I can say about this airplane is that the Megatech Customer Service is very helpful. The wing was sent to us with a huge crease that precluded its use (1st call to Customer Service - they sent me a new wing with no charge). The next problem was with the battery - it lasted for two flights (second call to Customor Service - made me pay for a new battery). It was probably because it was recharged while it was still warm from use (a no-no according to the directions), but I would say its a poor design if the battery can't be recharged immediately after use. Overall, for a remote control airplane this price is right, flying is easy, but the quality of the power system is poor."
5,Excellent companion for your Qur'an!!,"This is a nice to read book which talks about each Surah. Tafsir, contexts, teachings, stories, meanings, etc. A very nice book, quite thick but understandable to the student or scholar. Muhammad al-Ghazali was a great Shaykh from al-Azhar in the 20th century. Highly recommended for everyone!!"
5,Pleasing to the eye as well as the pocketbook !,"In true Pfaltzgraff tradition, this set does not fail to delight the eye as well as the pocketbook! The bowls are generous - not the dainty bowls so often seen with other dinnerware sets, and also included are nicely sized mugs - just perfect for coffee or hot cocoa. The design makes it perfect not only for Christmas, but for use all through the winter months. Also, since the design is available in open stock, there are numerous pieces that can be added to your Snow Bear collection. And the Amazon price for this set simply can't be beaten !!"
1,Don't even think of buying this..,This wheelchair bag is awful. The material is as thin as a silk. I bought nike sackbag instead.
5,Duro-Med Wheel Chair,"This is a great chair for the money! Folds up nice and tight and fits in the trunk of a car, easy open and light enough to move around without a problem. Very happy with this product."
4,Duro-Med Back Pack.,Great product for carrying medical records or papers or smaller objects.I like it and would recommend it for it's lightweight and convenience.
3,"Duro-Med Wheel chair Back Pack, Black","Duro-Med Wheel Chair Back Pack, BlackThe back pack is o.k but seems too wide. The straps slip off and the bag will slip as well and get caught in the wheels. Also sometimes hard to open to get at things, but will hold a lot even my purse. Probably needs to be a little heavier material but o.k. for the price. Also should be available in Navy instead of black. The Chair is Navy and the Cushion is Navy but not the backpack."
2,Strap broke the first time we used it.,"It's a lightweight bag, fits the wheelchair perfectly, and holds the foot pedals for chair the when they are not in use, but one of the straps ripped off the first time we used it so I had to sew it back on."
5,extra storage while i shop,I really like having this extra storage while I shop and not having to deal with a cumbersome shopping basket. thanks fast service
4,Serves My Needs,"This black back pack replaces a worn out blue one i used for 20 years. the new back pack is the same color of my chair. It is roomy for the variety of ""stuff"" i carry. i can reach it from my sitting position and dig out what I want The holding loops are strong. The simple velcro on the flap closes it adequately. My companions can, temporarily. use it for carrying their small needs."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"IT DOES NOT FIT WELL ON THE BACK OF THE WHEELCHAIR, BUT I AM GOING TO KEEP IT ANYWAY. I CAN FIND OTHER USES FOR IT."
3,"Taller than 18"" Height Seat Height in Product Description","The chair is very good quality, but I needed a chair with a seat height no taller than 18"" which is how this item was described. The person using the chair likes to sit in the chair and ""walk"" using her feet. She cannot do that if the seat is taller than 18"".Otherwise, the 19 1/4"" seat height would not be a factor. The chair is light and perfect for trips around town where most of the travel is inside. Much easier than loading and unloading a regular heavy wheel chair from your trunk.If I was not specifically looking for an 18"" seat height, I would have rated the chair five stars."
1,Did not fit,"Was listed as an accessory for wheelchair I ordered, but it could not fit over the brakes. Had to return it for a refund."
4,"Duro-Med Wheel Chair Back Pack, Black","This works pretty well. Fits nicely behind his chair. I actually bought it for his stroller/walker, so was hoping the straps would fit around it. Does a good job behind his wheel chair, though."
3,fits almost any wheelchair.,"I need something handy when I'm with my mother in a department store. In the Clinic for a medical revision. So this portable bag carries books. lens, yarn project and sweaters. It's perfect for it's size and carries heavy things as well.It's easy to adapt to my wheelchair a Karman light weight transport wheelchair."
5,Deep with velcro strap,"Deep enough to hold a purse or other items when shopping. Fits just fine, waterproof and durable."
5,Great Backpack!,It is a simple design but really is a great help when you have extra items to carry and also push a wheelchair. It is very deep and easy to close. I would recommend it.
2,Not so great if chair has hand brakes.,"I bought this when I bought a lightweight transport chair. The chair has handbrakes, that do not work well with this pack, which was promoted with that chair. The problem is that he loops used to hang this pack do not open. They are desiged to fit over the handles of the chair. However,if the chair has hand brakes, this won't work. If the loops had buckles or velcro that would allow them to be wrapped around any part of the frame, it would be great. Good size and construction, but for me to make this workable for me, I will have to do some modifications to these straps."
3,Adequate,"It works well enough, though it does not give the appearance of durability that the cloth backpacks do. Time will tell in that respect.However, the Duro-Med backpack does have a velcro-flap to close the backpack, is relatively waterproof against light rain, can hold enough emergency gear like a change of clothes, meds, etc. I would've like some small outside pockets for easier retrieval of minor items.I feel the price is a little high by a few dollars but I suppose it's a specialized product and these backpacks do come in handy."
3,HAD TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS,Had to make adjustments as the two loops that go over the handles did not fit as I have brake levers on handles. I used velcro straps to hold the back pack on the handles of the wheel chair. The design of the back pack should be changed to be more universal. .
5,Excellent product,"Excellent product. Carries bags, folders, etc. Frees up chair pusher to take care of occupant. Surprisingly roomy. Very good value."
1,"Duro-Med Wheel Chair back pack, black",This back pack is so flimsy. The only items you can really hold in it are paper items. This is not strong enough to carry anything else in it.
2,Duro Med Wheel Chair Back Pack,"Too thin and easy to rip, very disappointed in it. I really need a strong material so I can use it"
3,Not what I expected,"The pictures and description of this product are a little misleading. The product hasn't failed on me structurally speaking, however this bag is a very cheap, low-quality nylon with no rigid shape. My items often fall out of it and the velcro strip appears to just be a formality. I would recommend a zipping bag over this."
4,Good Sturdy Cup Holder,"I got one of these for my business and liked it so well, I ordered another. We have one by the coffee we have out for our customers and another in the staff room for water or coffee. I would give it five stars, but the little prongs that you bend to fit the cup size are a little bit hard to adjust correctly so only one cup comes out at a time. However, once you have it set - it works fine. In fact, it also works with heavy paper cups in addition to the foam cupsFoam Cup Dispenser with Removable Cap, Pull-Type, Sand."
4,versatile & great,These storage ottomans have been ideal for our den & just the right size to use as an ottoman or for storage. The quality is good for the price & we're enjoying them...would recommend them.
5,Amazing!,I bought this to use with my Sigma 10-22 super wide and I couldn't be happier with the results. I was recently shooting in Arizona and SoCal with this and it really made the pictures pop with sky color.
1,not happy at all,Misleading photo - looks like exact TOYOTA 4-wire plug as on my car - that is where I've been doomed. Actual thing was two bare wires. I needed 4-wire sensor not two wire one.
5,feeling the sublime,"As Laibach said, they are not musicians, but rather politicians. Do you want to know how ideology works.... listen then to the album, or even better go to the Laibach concert and you will get the meaning of life, and even more... You will fell power, you will see the universe, you will see god... And if you resist and go to the end, you will be scarred...and dead. I frendly reccomend; listen to Laibach, leave yourselve to the feeling, dare it...."
3,Rammstein on acid,"I was surprised to find a ""new"" laibach-cd in the record store, but ive bougth it and it surprisingly fresh. Rammstein on acid maybe can give a hint on what kind of an album this is. Maybe it deserves 4 stars, I dont know, Its cool anyway. Dark powerful and rythmic, like a washingmachine on steroids that's roaming the streets in a tank demanding worship."
5,a beautiful book,"This is a beautiful book and for anyone interested in our relationship with nature. It is a book that you must own, not borrow from the library, because it needs to be read over and over. It is similar to a meditation. The photographs are stunning and will lead you outside to find the forms in nature."
4,Simply Slipcovers,"This purchase was for my wife's business so I'm not able to rale it, however the book was in great shape it look new!"
2,Simply Slipcovers,I have been studying this book and plan to begin my slipcover project just as soon as I find my perfect fabric. This book is of great encouragement to me and I believe I will be successful on even my first attempt at slipcovers. Sandra R.
4,Thank goodness for slipcovers!,"I am an experienced sewer so I didn't think I needed a book to teach me how to make a slipcover. After all, I had made slipcovers for two upholstered chairs before. But I decided to buy this book to get ""tips"" on slipcovering my sofas--definitely much bigger projects than 2 chairs. I am happy I bought it. I love their techniques for roughly cutting out all the fabric you'll need in rectangles and squares and then simply draping these pieces over the couch, pinning in place, removing and sewing. This resulted in a very fitted and tailored look. One sofa down, one to go..... I'll admit I didn't follow all of their instructions--they are so long and detailed! They would probably be helpful for a beginner, but like I said, I've sewed for years so once I got to the pin-fit method on the couch I didn't open the book again."
4,Handy reference and with pictures too.,"I am into historical fiction, whether it be the meatier books such as those written by Sharon Penman or fluffier historical romances such as those written by Madeline Hunter, and appreciate this little reference book when I need to quickly check a fact or two about British history and monarchy. This book takes you from 600 AD up to Elizabeth II and is a small book so you know you're not getting any in-depth information but it's a good starting point. Another slightly more detailed reference I have is Richard Cavendish and Pip Leahy's KINGS AND QUEENS: The story of Britain's monarchs from pre-Roman times to today. That one is coffee-table quality with glossy paper and beautiful pictures."
5,Great album!,"A staple for any Ohio State fan prior to ""The Game."" Going to college in Michigan, my friends thought this album was both hilarious and catchy. Even if you hate the Buckeyes you have to respect the dedication of a band willing to go on stage dressed as Woody Hayes.Their lyrics are pretty crass, but undeniably clever. Anyone who refuses to chant ""Wide Left"" during ""The Ballad of Mike Lantry"" literally has no soul."
3,Yosemite established ties with the wrong tribe.,"I like the book, but Yosemite NPS DID NOT establish ties with the original Native Americans. Instead Yosemite NPS established and hired Indians who moved into the park to work in the 1900s. Yosemite mistakenly now keeps ties with Yokuts and not with the original Yosemites Indians.They Yosemite NPS has hired a park ethnologist who we believe does not have a degree, but was married to a Miwok woman. He has been re-writing the true history of the Indian people in Yosemite. Sad, but true."
3,Didn't fit my Compaq,"Although the memory types were identical, the notch for fitting the chip into the port was slightly misaligned, making it useless to me. Might have been a good product, but I never got it to work"
2,Disappointed with this product,I bought this product for a little boy's 3rd birthday. He wanted a leaf blower like his Daddy's. Within a week the pull string broke. There is no way to fix it and now he doesn't play with it. I would think a toy with the John Deere label would be a little more durable.
2,it doesn't blow very much,"we purchased this blower for our 2 year old's birthday because of the review on amazon that said it really blows and it's the only one that does. the reality is that even though the blower looks great and is durable, you have to pull very hard on a string several times and then a little ""puff"" of air comes out which would never blow a leaf. it doesn't make much noise because it's not battery operated. that could be a good thing except that our little boy thinks it's broken because it doesn't sound anything like daddy's. overall, a disappointment for our family. bummer."
1,Big disappointment,"My mother-in-law bought this for my son's 3rd birthday. The string came off at the party before we even got the toy home. Major upset. He's a big John Deere fan; has the gator, weedeater. For his upcoming birthday this year he wants a blower that works."
2,An interesting man but not a writer,"I do find this Gentleman very engaging, having seen some of his TV shows in Britian there is little doubt that he is a credible and committed figure. But you would have to be a very ardent fan to stick with this book, it does not have the richness of language nor the skill of emotional story development to bring any of the material to life.Mr Acorah is a very interesting man and doubtless a very nice man but he is not a writer, this in itself need not be a problem had the editorial and production team on this book done him justice. They simply don't and as such commit this book to a hard core fan purchases only. A shame really, it had all the potential of a bestseller for the RIGHT reasons."
1,Didn't love it,"This was my first Derek Acorah book, and I really didn't enjoy this one. I didn't even finish it. I love to read about psychics and mediums, usually, but this book was kind of boring. I traded it off."
2,The Psychic Adventures of Derek Acorah,Gives a little background to the T.V. personality but nothing indepth. I bought this because I was curious.Didn't satisfy me too much as a book. But it did give a look into Derek's background and ability.I would recommend this only to the true Derek Acorah fan.
3,Good,very informative. I just didn't understand why the author didn't get into the twisted scripture concerning the tithes and offerings.
5,Don't miss this book if you have suffered in a church group,"I highly recommend this book, especially if you have experiencedabuse in a shepherding type of controlling church or group.The author does a great job pointing out the difference betweenobeying God (and Scriptures) vs. man made rules. She alsopoints out some of the methods used to bring people under thedominating control of religous abusers. If you have beeninvolved in Boston Church of Christ, or any other abusivechurch or religous group, this book will be very helpful."
2,Could be Better!,"Don't waste you time or money on this one. A much better purchase is the 7 CD box set ""Have a Nice Decade"" produced by Rhino Records. I've taken this set to several parties and my friends can't get enought of it."
