3,Dogbones,"I use dog bone pillows in my practice. My only complaint is that after the first washing, some of the dark fabrics fade and appear old."
3,Neck pillow just ok,I think this pillow is too overstuffed and too hard to really be comfortable. Unfortunately I bought two of them. C'est la vie!
4,Good for napping in car,"I sometimes take a nap in the car to break up a long drive. Pull over, lean the seat back, put this neck pillow behind my neck, and off to a nice snooze."
4,Great value for the price and good product,"We've had our DogBone NeckBone pillow for a couple months now and happy with it. The quality is surprising for the price ($10 at the time we bought on Amazon). We are both chronic neck pain sufferers and on the nights when pain is really bad, this pillow makes a difference. My wife is very happy with it and uses it much more than I do. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is that it's a little awkward/stiff for me and I toss&turn a lot, so I only use it when I'm really having a rough pain day. I wish it was a little bit softer, but then I suppose it wouldn't do the job if that were the case. I assume it needs to be a bit stiff in order to provide support and keep your neck in proper place."
4,kinda fun,"I like my little dog bone pillow but I don't use it to sleep. It is set too high and too stiff for sleeping. It's good in the car, sitting around watching TV, or when laying back on your desk chair to take a little break from working..... anything that you'll spend an extended time doing and just would like some neck support.It looks really cute too!! A fun little thing."
2,Blah......,"Hi,I travel quite a lot for my job and I have tried several travel pillows including this one. It doesn't work, it was pretty disappointing actually. Cheaply made and not a lot of thought put into it.I found the simple pillow by Method Simple and it has been the answer to all my prayers.....forget the doggie neck pillow or whatever.I love my simple pillow.[...] - Check it ou"
2,Not so great,The neck pillow has a tear and the stuffing is coming out. Cheap product with cheap design! I bought this to use for traveling but had to buy another product for my neck.
1,Not Received Yet!!!,I don't know how long it usually takes but I have not received the neck pillows as of 9/18/12 a.m. If you can help expedite I willsure appreciate.
3,DogBone Pillow is overated,"I was really looking fwd to receiving my DogBones Pillow, after I read about it in the SHAPE magazine issue. When the product arrived I was dissapointed - it just looked like a standard pillow, much bigger in size than I expected and did not feel soft or comfortable at all! I brought it on my 5hr flight from Detroit to Seattle , and it didn't make my trip any better..."
1,"DogBones NeckBones Chiropractic Neck Pillow, Violet",I have been trying to find the perfect pillow to fit my neck for over 5 years now. This one was NOT it. Too big to fit me so it was very uncomfortable. I think I donated it our local Salvation Army. NOT worth the price.
5,"Love, love, LOVE this pillow!","I have had the paisley turquoise version for a couple of years now and it goes with me everywhere as well as in bed at night. I have had neck surgery and have had chronic neck problems for years, and this is the only pillow which actually lets me sleep well at night. It's a bit big for the plane so I bring a microbead pillow for then, but in the car it is more supportive and I take it pretty much everywhere. I love it so much that even our old Lab will pull out the neck pillow from my bed and bring it to me during the day while I'm sitting at the computer--Emma knows that Mom loves her pillow! The only thing I wish is that it came in something a little softer like corduroy, so I am thinking of trying to get a friend to sew a cover for it (the old material is beginning to pill after many washings). Otherwise, it has held up just great without coming apart at the seams. I have also given this away as gifts to friends and they all love it!!"
5,pain-free at last,"I've had chronic neck and shoulder pain for over 30 years and during that time, I've tried dozens of pillows designed for the problem but nothing really worked, although some were better than others. This little pillow is fantastic! I'm finally able to fall asleep and not have to try to ignore the pain. I'm pain-free. It's really fantastic.As an additional benefit, it holds my head in such a way that my throat is open, eliminating the snoring problem.I love this little pillow!"
5,Heaven!,"I purchased the Chiropractic Neck Dogbone, Pillow, and it came very quickly. I haven't had any neck problems since purchasing the Dogbone Pillow! It's a must for anyone who experiences neck pain!"
5,"Excactly what I was looking for!!,",I used to be able to find these pillows occasionally in my local stores. For the last two years I couldn't find them anywhere. So When I found them here I was amazed and then after I received them I was delighted with them.. Thank you for a great product..
2,just ok,"Bought 2 of these for a cross country flight for my husband and I. They take up a lot of space to pack in a carry on, and are too big when used on an airplane."
1,cheap fabric,"I used this for neck support while driving, the fabric itched from day one, then it gave me rashes on the back of my neck after 1 week. Stopped using it and sure enough no more rashesMaybe I'll use it for back support, but not for where it would be touching my skin."
3,"Adequate, but not great","From the reviews on this site, I thought this product would provide an out-of-this-world pillow nirvana. However, the NeckBones is a little too small to provide complete support. For its size, it is an adequate head and neck support, but if you want to have a very comfortable rest while on the bus or airplane, bring something larger."
2,dogbone neck pillows,"Both of the neck pillows I recently bought have already needed hand-stitching repair, having come apart at the seam."
5,Love dog bones,"I love dog bone pillows. Have several bad cervical discs and this little pillow has make such a difference. Not going to claim it has cured anything but it spares me a lot of pain and discomfort. Takes a little getting used to - unless your neck is really acting up when it arrives and then it makes such an immediate difference you don't notice the sleeping position adjustment - once you're used it you won't be able to use a regular or other cervical pillow. I had to fight my husband with degenerative disc disease to even try mine - when he did I never got it back. We now own four, two in our TV area and two in the bed (got tired of trudging back to the TV room when we forgot to take it to bed). They wash (front load machine gentle cycle, med spin and dry on low heat) like a dream. Wonderful for us, I hope they will do as much for others."
4,Keeps my head still,This product keeps my head still while in bed. I think this prevents me from tossing around. It seems to support my neck well. I have not experienced any neck pain.
5,Satisfied Customer,"I ordered 3 DogBones Chiropractic Neck pillows to qualify for free shipping. Product received in good time, as advertised and equal quality to a pillow I purchased at Walgreens some years ago. I use this pillow as my primary pillow and find it very comfortable. One pillow will stay in car for trips and the other two in different bedrooms."
2,Not good,I don't understand all the great reviews for this pillow. I have chronic neck pain and I hoped this pillow might help. It does not help and I find it uncomfortable. Maybe there is no hope for me. It might be a nice travel pillow for people who have no neck problems.
1,stuffing comes out of the fabric,"some kind of synthetic stuffing which is small enough to push through the holes of the fabric cover, making a mess."
5,Perfect cushion for my neck,"My neck is always killing me so I ordered this. This pillow is the perfect shape for reading, relaxing, watching tv, or sleeping. My dog-bone pillow arrived about a week ago and hasn't been far from my side since."
2,Did not like,I purchased this pillow for my neck when sitting in a chair. It is too large and too firm for a neck support. It is more suited for the back only.
2,Too Big,"I was hopeful this would replace my long used chiropractic neck pillow, but its too puffy. To support my neck with my head on the bed, it then puffs around the side and annoys my ears. Disappointed."
2,OK if slightly reclined,"I live in Germany and travel often. My regular U shaped neck pillow had bit the dust so was about to buy another when I came across these. Great reviews so I guess they work for may but when sitting in a plane in the upright position, it was a no-go. It pushed me forward. In the reclined position it was nice but found it not too different than the others. I'm 5'4 if that makes a difference."
2,quality has gone downhill,"I have used the dog bone pillows for years and loved them. They have been regular traveling companions for me on planes and in hotels. I ordered my new pillow enthusiastically but when it arrived, one squeeze was all it took to realize that the stuffing material had changed. It had a springy feel to it instead of a firm feel. This just won't serve the purpose of supporting my neck the way the older pillows did. Please bring back the old filling material!"
3,Cute but ineffective,"It is too tall for the shape of my head/neck and doesn't compress very much. So it put me in an awkward and uncomfortable sleeping position. Nicely made, pretty fabric, useless in my case. Sorry..."
2,Quality Control Issues,"The shape of this pillow is great, comfortable and convenient. But!!I ordered two blue ones at the same time. They are made of different fabrics and are very different shades of blue.One has a zipper for a removable cover, the other one does not.There is no inner ""pillow"" case, and the fill works it's way out of the fabric, so it appears you have been letting the pets use it, even if you have no pets. It's impossible to pick all the little fibers out of the cover. It constantly looks like it needs cleaning. To wash the cover, you will have to remove the fill and then try to restuff it.Too bad the makers don't take that little extra effort to provide a quality product. :("
1,Changed Over Time To Disappointing,"I must have purchased at least 15 dogbone pillows over the years and have been a huge fan. But my last order? Grrr. Someone in their wisdom decided to add a zipper to the pillows. One pillow had a zipper on the end; no big deal. An identical pillow has a zipper in the bend of the neck. This is a big deal because if you roll over in the night you can scratch your eyelid and cheek like I did. AND, the pillows do not have the same amount of stuffing as they used to; it's less so it doesn't support the neck as well. Very Sad. Very disappointed to see a good product devolve."
4,Give your neck a bone!,"I got this pillow for my mom, who suffers from chronic neck pain, and she loves it! I will be purchasing one for myself."
2,Too Big,I have neck problems and I purchased this pillow to support my neck at night. It was too big and there was no way to open and remove some of the stuffing unless you cut it open and re-sewed. I gave it about a week hoping I could get used to it. I ended up purchasing a Bucky Minnie Bamboo Neck Pillow which works perfectly. You can remove the outer cover to wash. You can unzip the interior and remove some of the stuff if it is too big.
1,Pillow too big,This pillow was too big and bulky to be useful on an airplane. I could see how it would be great used as a normal pillow.
2,Be careful of color bleeding,"I bought the red version, took it out of the packing bag, and threw it on my microfiber couch. Two days later I went to use it and it had stained the bottom and back cusions red. Neither the pillow nor the couch were wet, and it's still in the 40s here (no humidity).I have no clue whether washing it first would have helped, but just a forewarning about the color of the pillow possibly bleeding."
2,neckbone pillow,"I enjoyed sleeping with the neckbone pillow for about seven years. I've washed it many times and was still completely satisfied with it. The fabric was thinning as well as I got a hole on one corner so I had been looking for a replacement pillow for a couple of years and finally found it online. So happy to have found it again, I purchased two. However the material used to stuff the new pillows has obviously changed. The new one is very soft and foamy. The old one was stuffed with cotton. Lets just say I am disappointed, but I still have my old reliable."
5,GENERAL UTILITY GLOVES,GOOD LIGHT WEIGHT GLOVE THAT STAYS IN PLACE WHILE YOU WORK - ALLOWS PERSPIRATION TO EVAPORATE. VELCRO STAYS SECURE GLOVES.
3,Breaks easily,My husband and I had just assembled the butterfly tent when trying to move it out of the house one of the support bars completely broke! My husband had to buy a plastic pipe around that size to fix it. Although this is a great idea for hatching butterflies perhaps the way to go is to buy a smaller pavillion that hangs.
2,A big disappointment!,"I bought this butterfly bungalow for my six-year-old grandson. The butterflies did hatch, but they were all dead the next day. He was really disappointed."
4,Historical pop-up,"Gives good perspective of what Stonehenge is and relationship of objects to each other. Have to admit, I learned something from this book."
3,It's just for kids,"This is a children's book. Oversize and very thin, with delightful pictures, published in the UK and affiliated with English Heritage.(akin to US Parks and Tourism) Addresses the history with text and two very simple pop ups. Simple and interesting- who knows this could be the start of a young archaeologist's library."
1,Magnetic only on one side,"I thought it would be cool to teach our little boy about how magnets work with this train, however it's not as easy to get the magnets to stick to the base of the train as one would think. There is only one side of each of the pieces that attaches magnetically to the train's base. So that means you have to try up to 6 surfaces to find the ""sticky"" surface. Seems like a simple thing but it's kind of annoying. Wouldn't have bought this had I known this."
3,The nature of magnets make this toy difficult,"At first one might think that magnets would make wooden blocks easier to use. However, I find the opposite to be true. The age recommendation is 12 months +. My son is 13 months, and is far from figuring out how magnets work.As an adult, I find myself enjoying fiddling with the train, but mildly irritating that there is no way to predict how the symmetrical blocks will fit together. I actually enjoy the non-magnetic Haba Fantasy blocks I got for my son better.It seems like a high quality product.I Might recommend the train for:1. An older child who may benefit from learning about magnets.2. A child who already likes regular wooden blocks and might like a variation and challenge."
3,A beat em up with guns = win,Die Hard arcade is a Sega arcade game from 96 or 97 it was ported to the Saturn in 97 or 98. it's a fairly solid beat em up 2 of Sega's most popular franchises were Streets of Rage preferably part 2 & Virtua Fighter 1&2 to mix the 2 together put out some good results. There's a few problems the game can be cheap if you don't learn a few of the moves the bosses can be cheap too but if you have a good supply of 9MM clips you'll have no problem. Story is not vvery much like the movie. Terrorist's have taken over the Nakatomi Tower but in the games case they have kidnapped the Presidents daughter. Why cause this game was called Dynamite Dekka in Japan so they brought it over here to the U.S & they were going to make Streets Of Rage 4 out of of it thank God they didn't games to short about 16-20 minutes so they just slapped Die Hard on a arcade machine. But it's a fairly solid beat em up & very action packed.
5,Excellent choice for all ages,"King of the Trees is a childrens story of magic, imagination and fire breathing dragons coupled with Christian values and Biblical inferences which is wonderful reading for all ages. As a senior citizen I have read it from cover to cover and enjoyed every chapter. I will definitely recommend it to my children and grandchildren as a classic."
4,"Sturdy, Elegant Garden Scoop","This is a wonderful garden tool -- I do believe it would last forever. And it is very 'artistically' made -- a beautiful tool. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instesd of 5 was because of its weight. I have weak hands and arms and did not realize how heavy it was. It is very effective, but I cannot use it for long. If you don't have weak hands and/or arms, this is the best tool money can buy!"
4,an engrossing collection,"If you've read any of my other reviews of Carroll's books, you'll know I'm a bit of a groupie, so I may have liked these stories more than most. Sure, not every story was perfect, but Carroll is so creative and so bizarre that I could not put this book down. Since I had just finished A Child Across the Sky, I had read two of the stories already as they are contained in that novel. Furthermore, Black Cocktail is published in a separate volume. That still leaves a good 17 stories or so that are ""new"" and I loved all of them. I think he's better at novels, but I enjoy his stories because he is able to isolate one or two wild ideas into a coherent story rather than jumbling them all together in a novel where they don't always make sense. For some reason, I really liked the ""Zoondel"" story about a special breed of dog that recognizes werewolves. If you're a Carroll fan, you'll definitely want to see how he translates some of his shorter ideas into short stories."
4,Good enough read--one story stands out,"I'm usually not a short fiction reader. It usually doesn't evolve enough to be interesting. I enjoyed speculative fiction because it focuses on cocnept and ideas and how they play out in the future. Gives my mind more to think about than the limits of the prose.I enjoyed this collection well enough. JC's writing is always a comfortable read. However the story ""Uh-Oh City"" is awesome. He presents an idea that I would love to see fleshed out. He leaves questions on the mind that want to be answered. The book was worth it for that story alone for me."
3,"Good book, but...","Is it me or does Jonathan Carroll always finds a way to explicitly explain why the weird things happen to the people in the stories? I don't know, but it seems like there is some person to explain everything about why what's going on. Couldn't there be some sort of information to describe it and have the reader make their own conclusions?"
2,Fails to protect from cold,"I bought these gloves to use at work in a freezer full of frozen food and they utterly fail to keep my hands warm. Despite the nice aesthetic design and the impressive grip performance, the stitching on the gloves allows water to seep inside which quickly approaches freezing temperatures. This is unacceptable and I can almost say that I would prefer working without any gloves. I contacted the company (they are in Los Angeles) and they said that they are aware that the gloves are not waterproof. The suggestion was to scotch guard the gloves. I have yet to try this so I can't say if it is worth it. They also told me that they are developing a waterproof pair of gloves, so we'll just have to wait and see if they are an improvement. For now I can only recommend these gloves to the style-conscious person that does not have to use them in a damp or bitter ""cold condition."""
2,Something Missing,"Hutzulak's style is wonderful and his work is full of interesting pieces like ""They sat across the table... but more than the table separated them..."" Unfortunately, the work is missing information about the characters and their actions that could make it a more satisfying and interesting work. It is difficult to know the motivation behind much of what happens in the book. In the end, I felt like I had read the story of a loser whom I didn't know enough about. The afterlife description was interesting but there wasn't enough done with it. The visit to the ex-wife had alot of potential but didn't get you inside the relationship enough to know more than the fact that the main character was a loser who had wasted a relationship. The sex was gratuitous and keeps me from passing this interesting attempt to friends."
1,"ugly sex, unexplained violence","This book offers lots of ugly sex and unexplained violence. Not only is there no explanation as to why the main murder occurs, there is no explanation about where the murderer ends up or why. This book is easily read in a few hours, lots of empty pages and title pages with no text, and not much substance to the story. The author's descriptions are vivid, but description alone doesn't make a good novel. If you like poetry then you might find this book interesting to read. But if you're looking for a good story, look elsewhere."
1,INFERIOR -NO QUALITY CONTROL,I ORDERED THIS ITEM TWO TIMES AND BOTH TIMES IT CAME WITHOUT AN END ON IT TO HOOK UP TO A FAUCET. I WOULD NOT ORDER THIS ITEM AGAIN EVEN IF IT WAS FREE!!!
4,A Great Little Book,"It's hard to believe this book is not fiction. The events are riveting, and described in an enjoyable, readable format.I do want to say how disappointed I am that this book is out of print and some copies are apparently selling for as much as $65.00. That is just nuts. I hope there is a re-issue at some point. This book is good, but it should cost under $10.00."
3,try it before you buy it,"I bought this book based on pictures alone because I was convinced that the salads would be amazing. First, 80% of the recipes include anchovies as an ingredient. If you don't like anchovies, you're out of luck. Secondly, many of the recipes seem fickle - either over salted or the process of making them is made far, far, far too complicated when it could be easily done another way. Borrow this from a friend or from the library and then decide whether it's a good fit for you."
1,Shipped Different Part With Same Item #,Ordered 3 of these from AMAZON got 1 that was correct but not colored as pictured & 2 that were completely different than pictured one of which was missing a coupler so it couldn't be used. CAUTION WHEN ORDERING WHAREHOUSE DOESN'T KNOW THEY'RE SENDING THE WRONG ITEM!!!!!
5,Great quality!,I bought this as a spotting scope to use at the target range. This is very good quality at a fair price. Sharp and clear.
1,Not worth the $$$,Crappy optics above 25x. Really crappy.Black dots on white paper appear to have red and blue rings around them.The only good thing about it is decent eye relief.Don't waste your money like I did.
1,Christian in Today's Culture by Colson Disappointing,"Although the book contained some ideas that were thought provoking, I found much of the book dogmatic and narrow-minded. Most of the author's conclusions about education, for example, were based on opinions and distorted, and inaccurate information. Knowing how wrong he was about education, also made me question whether his conclusions on other topics were also just opinions or distortions."
1,Boots Not Made for Walkin',"This toy broke within the first few uses. The dog stopped walking, and it pulls the doll on boots with skates. We changed the batteries, but still no go. My brother fixed it several times. My niece loved it at first, but after two days, my brother tired of fixing it, so she lost interest. She was also upset that the doll's clothes can't be changed, and it can't sit (because of the mechanical stuff in it)."
4,cute doll,I love how cute the doll looks. The dog and doll doesnt walk far but it is cute and my niece loves chloe anyway. Doll worked as expected.
5,Celebrating Catholic Education,"This novel celebrates Catholic education and the vocation of Catholic teachers. Light reading, but a profound message of hope and perseverance in the day to day challenges of Catholic education. Sister Gervaise is the heroine; her struggle to be a good nun and educator is one experienced by many, but proclaims that the struggle is worth it!"
5,I love Hideaki.,"Hideaki, a friend and colleague of mine, shows the world what we at Herricks High School have already known...he is amazing. Listening to his playing envokes emotions of pleasure and excitement. This Album truly brings out all of that and more!"
2,This book lacks in my areas.,The reason I did not like this book: No photos of how to perform each exercise in various stages. It presented older techniques and older famous bodybuilders. It was only 79 pages and the was not well written at all. It did not go in depth on each exercise. This was one of the worst books on bodybuilding I have ever read.
5,Great book for muscular arms,If you want to build more muscular arms this book will really help. The section on brachialis training alone is worth the price. The book also has a good discussion of the importance of the triceps.
5,i like this keypad a lot!,"This keypad does exactly what it's supposed to do. It takes just 1 AAA battery, which lasts for months. And it blinks green and red all day and night. You can push the buttons and it beeps, so it looks as real as possible. With the sticker it is simply the cheapest alternative to a real alarm system out there."
2,Looks fake,I wanted a fake key pad to make it appear I have an alarm on my shop. This wouldn't fool even a dumb robber. I returned it.
4,sleep review,I think that this book will change people lives. Its a good book. A bit alarmist at time but i feel that just to keep the americans Interested. Over all I find that the content is very good but a little complicated for the ordinary reader. However I feel its is a very important book and people would benifit it from it greatly.
2,Do you really need 10 hours?,"Let me save you some time with this book: the author says you need more sleep. 10 hours in fact. If you fall asleep when your head hits the pillow, you are likely sleep deprived and you need more time sleeping. If you are in this category (as am I) this book won't help much, beyond some good tips on napping.If you cannot fall asleep easily, or wake often, this book has lots of detailed advice, from how to decorate your bedroom and what to do there, to when to eat dinner, what not to drink, watch on TV, and so on. This is probably a useful book for those who cannot sleep. Me? I should have skipped it and caught an extra hour."
2,Works if you move the cord in a certain position...,"I was excited to order this product and it was sold from the seller ""Bowtie.Products."" Upon receiving the system, I plugged it in and it didn't work. All of the cords were connected, game inserted, and the TV was registering that something was being turned on. Apparently, one of the cords that plugs into the back (I'm assuming the video cord) is not working properly and you have to move it to a certain position to get the video to work. If you move the system in the slightest after it has been positioned, the video cuts out. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend buying this product from ""Bowtie.Products"" due to the fact that they promised a system that was in good condition and they failed to deliver. I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase."
5,"VOMA is a great indie band from Lafayette, LA","I live in Lafayette and had the pleasure of seeing them play at a show, and by the time I realized they were great they broke up. I listen to everything from punk to screamo to progressive to post-hardcore to classic rock, and this is basically the hybrid of anything you would want in music. Whenever I searched from them I did not really think anything would come up, but you are truly lucky to be able to purchase this no matter where you are from. The internet can expose you to great music you would have never known about some 20 years ago before its existence. Buy this, you won't be sorry."
1,lousy,"lousy ... is the best word for this book.p.49 new web page...press this,press that...I did...nothinghappened.Yes,I am not experienced user,thats why I bought a book.Useless."
5,Best intermediate level course ever written,"What I really like about this book is how it caters for the student who seriously wants to improve. There is a lot more to it than you might think from seeing the cover, and I learned a lot about strategy and endgames. There are four things I found especially helpful:1. the book covers a big range of topics, like how to make a plan or the important of pawn structures.2. the diagram examples feature many famous games and famous players.3. endgames are covered in detail (I have found that other books of this type ignore them).4. there is lots of advice on how to improveIf you are an intermediate player (say rated 800 to 1900 USCF) this book will greatly benefit you."
3,Fun book to read but analysis is lacking,"I enjoyed this book. However, it may not be the sharpest tool in the shed (as my father says). It has many good pointers. Some of the stories can be a bit silly. I collect chess books at the age of 12. Older, but a better book is CHESS FOR FUN AND CHESS FOR BLOOD."
4,"Reclaim Your Power ,Transform your Life","Astrology for Self-Empowerment Techniques for Reclaiming Your Sacred Power By: Dovid Strusiner Llewellyn Publications,(2000). Paperback, 168 pages. ISBN: 1-56718-644-0In Astrology for self-empowerment you will learn how to analyze and interpret your natal chart to help you make positive transformations in your life.

The author focuses on empowering techniques combined with teaching you to understand the basics of astrology to help you fulfill your highest goals and dreams."
2,Okay bed,"This bed is okay. The underside is like sleeping bag fabric, and the top part is a little softer and not as slippery. It works well for a travel bed but wouldn't really be thick enough to serve as something permanent. My biggest complaint is the way it came packaged. The drawstring part of the bag was pulled very tightly shut and locked in place with a teeny, tiny zip tie. The only way I could manage to get this very small zip tie off with scissors also managed to cut the drawstring, rendering the bag 100% useless. The bed still has some pretty cheap straps on it (they're already shredding apart, even though I JUST opened it), so you can still roll it up and tie it into a bundle, if you ruin your bag trying to remove the packaging like I did."
5,Good stuff!,"I really dug William Harms' graphic novel Abel, so I was excited to learn that Bad Mojo had hit shelves. And better yet, that it involved witches and (sorta) zombies!If you've followed his writing in PC Gamer magazine, you know that Harms is a MEGA-fan of the horror genre, and that love and delight definitely come through here. Bad Mojo is infinitely less bleak than Abel, but it keeps the same refreshingly down-to-earth feel that you're pleasantly surprised to find in a comic.This isn't the stuff of capes and villains---it's regular people coping with the craziness that life sends you...with a supernatural twist. These characters talk like you do; they act like you do; they screw up like you do. And then they try to figure out what the hell to do.Part 1 leaves you with a serious itch for the rest of the story. You WILL enjoy it."
5,A great story for kids,"I agree w/ the review below--this book is better than Freaky Friday. I've never forgotten how I wanted my own TV set that broadcast tomorrow's news today. This story has such charm, magic, and realism in it. Every child should read this book."
4,very well done but very graphic,"wanted to show this too kids for my spanish class but far to graphic violence, severed heads, a lot of blood and dead victims from the drug war, overall well done"
3,Nothing really new here,"If you want to get into IT, this book presents a great description of what it is really like to work in IT.If you already work in IT, this book makes you feel better with similar frustrations from other people.I already work in IT and I was not very interested in hearing other people complain about how overworked they are. Yeah, I know, I'm in the same boat.Here's a better way to get your IT career in gear - get your degree and get certified in your area of interest. That's it, no secret, really."
2,HELPFUL,"But a little dated. Be sure to also check out Ian Fisher's ""How to Start a Career in Information Technology, 2nd edition"" 2007."
1,"This Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ha,ha,ha!!!!!!!!!!!!","The movie is made of toy bulidings, and a guy in a jump suit as Godzilla, is an idiot!!! Oh, boy he kills a bunch maniacs who are running away from a person killing everybody!!! They are bunch of gods. (...) These prople are nothing to me!!! If, this was real everybody would be dead and God would kill Godzilla and send to him to the great depths of hell where his body would be engulfed by fire and gory violence, and blood would be everywhere and so on!!!(...)"
1,taylor support says - wiring defect,"Recieved my scale, it looks nice and is sturdy, but will not give your weight - only 0.0, no matter how many people and things I tried to weigh in. Taylor support says the scale is defective - there's a wiring problem. Buyer beware. I'm ordering a different brand to replace."
5,Good Value,"I read dozens of customer reviews before purchasing this scale and am very pleased with it. The weight tracking feature was easy to program and is consistent and accurate in its readings. I am on a weight loss program, so seeing how much closer I am to my goal each time I step on the scale is very encouraging and motivating. This scale is an excellent value for the money and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to track their weight."
3,"Great value, but photo credits","This was a great price for a great photo. It arrive in less than a week and was well packaged in a sturdy tube. My only issue is that the photo credits and website are printed on the lower-left corner of the photo. Why couldn't this be done on the back? Howcome the review didn't mention it? I'm having it mounted, so I would have to crop the photo to remove the credit and I didn't want to cut out the photographers in the lower-left corner. Oh well. I would have given 5 stars had I known about the credits."
5,And Presenting.... Stag!,"This simple toy model may be a still, lifeless thing, a TOY to adult eyes. But to children's eyes, this stag is peering over a bush, in a thick woods, lifting his mighty head and pricking the keen ears to hear a dog barking in the distance. This model truly brings animals to life, and this may seem a bit much to talk about a TOY, but this object is not a TOY. He is REAL. Accurate and magical details and perfect measurment add up to this splendid toy. Very durable and very educational for kids!!!!~Moonwhisker~"
2,"Try again, Duane.","This book is poorly written and it is one of a string of poorly written books by this author. He does not get detailed enough and this is true on every one of his efforts. It is almost laughable. He considers himself a grand expert on Colorado history and has no more a concept than a broad smear of the subject although his trade is as a professor. This duplicity astounds me. His writing is 6th grade level and he constantly misses the details and the background behind the specific point. This book, AGAIN, confirms this."
4,Little Leaps Thomas,"I purchased this and Dora at a special discounted rate around the holidays for my 2 yr old son. We tried Dora first and both of us were bored. So I was skeptical about how Thomas would be. But thank goodness my son enjoys it, as do I. While he doesn't watch the Thomas television show he is familiar with the trains so it grabs his interest. This game covers manners, feelings, letters and numbers and focuses on social skills. As far as the toddler Little Leaps line goes I find this one to be one of the best ones, with Leap Ahead as my second preference, though I don't care for the LeapFrog characters on it (we have yet to try the Backyardigans game)."
4,Little Leaps,"If you have a Thomas fan and a Little Leaps unit, this is a fun little game. Would recommend the purchase."
2,expensive,"I ordered this toy, and couldn't tell that you needed to purchase an expensive piece of other equipment to use it, and i have purchased a LOT of leap frog items and it's always clear what equipment it works on. so now I have had to spend another $40.00 on a piece of equipment that doesn't have many games with it, and he will outgrow in one year. I would have been better off buying something else."
1,For Complete Office 2000 Neophyte,"Perhaps if you have never used Excel *AND* have no idea what a relational database is, this would be a worthwhile purchase. Otherwise I hope there are other Access 2000 books out there for computer professional, power users, and intelligent users to learn the tricks of the trade.While I have a light background in dBase and relational databases, I needed to come up to speed quickly on how to best exploit Access 2000. This book was not a good match. Pages spent on how to delete a column, change a font, include a picture, etc. I went through the 300 page book in just over 4 hours. While I now have enough of an introduction to Access to put databases togehter, I am now in search of a reference book.Besides the lack of content, I found the book disjointed: to much typing of data (most books include sample databases on CD); and missed steps in putting the sample databases together."
4,Un buen libro de MS Access para principiantes,"Este libro es recomendable para personas que nunca han usado el MS Access ,en el contenido se explica como hacer tablas ,formularios,cuestionarios y reportes. La forma visual en que es explicado cada tema,hacen de este libro un articulo muy atractivo para los usuarios de base de datos . El material grafico es una de las ventajas con que cuenta este ejemplar y hace que sea menos pesado durante el ciclo de aprendizaje y ademas mantienen al lector siempre con ansias de aprender algo mas cada momento"
1,not for 360,"well the game is not xbox 360 compatible, seller should post it on the description, only cost me 20 bucks but it's the disapointment in my son's face that cost me the most."
3,It's Ok...,"Didn't have the same appeal as the original 2D one did, but it killed about 2 nights of my life.. then it sat on the shelf to never be played again..."
3,spy vs spy,Hard to rate this product when it does not work in our xbox live 360. We have this item and it is only made for xbox and is not compatible for the xbox 360 live. condition of the game and the timely manner we recieved it were good. It just sucks that it doesn't work on our system.
2,It has some usefull info in it.,Well it tells you the proper way to insert the thermostat. However It won't help you disassemble and reassemble the dash board when installing a new heater core.
4,"great clarity and clean visuals, a little big",I picked this up to use at the gun range and it works great. I used it at 20X for all the way up to 400 meters (on steel targets) so far and it is performed well. It is a little big but that has to be expected from an 80mm lens. All in all I am very satisfied with this product. It is very good quality for the price. I would recommend spending the money over the cheaper spotting scopes.
1,Extremely Dissatisfied,This hat only has a 7 inch brim-I purchased it because it was advertised as having an 8 inch brim-I already have several 7 inch brim hats & I did'nt want to order another. Luxury Divas has put me in a impossible situation with false advertisement. Their policy is if I return the hat I'll have to pay return shipping and a 15% restocking fee even though it's their error. I resent the fact that I'm stuck with a hat that was advertised incorrectly.
3,Just so-so,"The hat seems nice if you add a scarf or something to it. It is very large and somewhat stiff and doesn't look as floppy as the picture. It seems more like a solid brim hat. It is not very pliable and is too large for my taste without the softness of pliability. Looks almost like a sombrero. Additionally, it came out of the package with what seems to be a permanent crease in the brim on one side so I think I will have to return this and try again next year."
2,Not very practical,Bigger than I would have liked but it was decribed and reviewed that way. It is flexible and you can play around with the brim if needed. Didn't stand up well. Disappointed
5,Best bike rack I've found!,Just got the rack and love it! Fit right on my current hitch in one click. Well thought out lightweight rack for 2 bikes. Goes on and off so quickly and is light weight. Why it's not sold everywhere is beyond me. Highly recommend it.
4,Great Bike Rack,I purchased this item to attach to our cargo carrier. Fit perfectly and was able to take one bike on vacation as well as all of our gear. Didn't have any problems on our 5 hour drive.
4,Good product.,"Like the product, smart design, especially for the price.Would be nice if it had a lever for removing it from your hitch (snaps up very quickly), maybe a slightly larger hole in the top brace for a lock (I'm drilling it out) & maybe a longer cable on it for the bike locking part. These are all minor but would put it over the top.Need to ensure your hitch has enough room between the end of your receiver and the ball or drop down piece.Definitely recommend to someone who wants to tow a trailer or camper and wants to take a few bikes.I have also put 3 full size bikes on it. Worked fine, just keep a bungee or two and a towel handy (they'll fit in the storage bag too).Hope this helps you if your a potential purchaser."
1,These are quite inferior to other models.,"1. I have used various models of this type of light for years. This is, by far, the most finicky and hard to get adjusted right. Mine keep going on and off at odd times, and no adjusting makes them work easily or as well as others I have used.2. As noted, the bulbs are an odd size, are not easily found, and are not easily replaced in the units compared to other types of units.I am very unhappy that I purchased three of these units and installed them. I plan to replace all three of them and return them as quickly as I can. If I only had one of these, I'd think the problem was that one unit and return it. But I have three, and they all are trouble."
1,"Works well enough, but lamp life is awful!","Like the other reviewers, I also hate this fixture. I've replaced the lamps three times in the past year, with the last two giving me about 3 days' life before blowing out. I returned from a short trip to find my driveway dark and insecure.The lamps always fail the same way - the internal structure just falls apart, leaving the filament intact but unconnected. My thoughts are that the lamps aren't made to be used base-side up. And yes, I know how to handle the glass envelope of halogen lamps - these were installed correctly. Like the other reviewer, the tiny flat-blade set screw that holds the lens assembly in place is tiny. While mine hasn't locked up, it is such a pain to twist around on a ladder, crane your neck under the eaves and find that tiny screw, not drop it and not drop the entire lens assembly.The upside are the small ""eyelid"" shades that keep light spill out of the neighbor's windows."
3,"Works, but can't find replacement bulb","It works. I installed it on the side of the house as security light, also its motion sensetive could prevent forgetting turn the light off.However, the cast iron light holder saying using Type T bulb, the Type T bulb from store is different."
1,Hope a Bulb Doesn't blow,"Works ok as far as the motion sensor is concerned. One bulb blew about six months after it was installed and then the fun began. The set screw was totally locked up; applying more force with the screwdriver stripped the slots. I finally got it off with visegrips. Then I managed to drop the bulb housing and the glass, rubber seal and metal retaining ring all popped out. What followed was two hours of SCREAMING FRUSTRATION as I tried to put all the components back in. I never did get the seal in; I resorted to shooting a bead of silicone around the flat to (hopefully) seal the bulb off from the elements.The final verdict is it's way too involved just to do something as simple as change a bulb (which appears to have an incredibly short life span) and the internal construction is cheap and flimsy. Just not a well-engineered product. I wouldn't purchase another one."
2,Poor design but good warranty,"These units have a 10-yr warranty. All you need to do if you have a problem is call HeathZ at 1800-858-8501 and explain the problem. If they cannot fix it over the phone, they will send you a new one. When it arrives, just toss out the old unit. For me this is fine because I can reach my light from my back steps. I'd want something more dependable for my lights where I need to use a ladder."
5,Great product,This is the second one I've purchased. The previous fixture lasted nearly 15 yrs. love the timed low level light feature. Sensor works well.
1,Inferior-Terrible Design,Why do companies design products they KNOW will be defective. It is almost impossible to replace the bulbs (a design issue that appears to be purposeful) and the bulbs (1) don't last and (2) are expensive and hard to find.
4,"Verdi Requiem, Vienna Philharmonic (SACD)","While the chorus doesn't quite live up to its potential in this superbly lyrical score, both the soloists and the orchestra are beyond reproach. I was mesmerized- best recording of this piece that I have heard in years."
3,Zurich Deutsche,"My boyfriend is Swiss, born in the capital Bern. Ive been wanting to learn his language to make visiting family more fun so I bought pimslers swiss german. After listening and practicing my boyfriend informed me that a lot of the terms and phrases are only used in Zurich, and others are out of date.If you study with this, people will most likely understand you... but when they start giggling its because your talking like their grandmother/father might.I understand its hard to make a course on swiss german because there are around 13 different dialects all over the country, each having its own expressions and twists on words. But i would love it someone could make one using the current Bern dialect.Overall this is a good product to learn, even if what your learning is out of date."
4,Excellent short history of Soviet heavy tanks,"Steve Zaloga is an expert on Soviet Armored Fighting Vehicles. This is a well written study of the history of Soviet Heavy tanks. I particularly enjoyed reading and seeing the prototype tanks that never made it into production. There are many line drawings and text to help clarify some of the misconceptions of Soviet tank manufacture. I only wish that the cut away drawing were not cut in half by the pages. Can't have everything, but this is a very good primer, I definately recommend adding this to your collection."
4,A must for modellers,"An exhaustive book about the evolution, variations and derivatives of the Stalin series.A must for modellers, if you like to be accurate to the date and scenario of your model."
1,Obsolete,"Good for it's day when there was nothing better, but now the book by Baryatinsky ""The IS Tanks"" is head & shoulders over this one. This book is so over taken by Baryatinsky that further review is pointless."
4,One of the lost gems for Saturn,"I completely missed this one when I was younger. I admit, I might of jumped ship when the Playstation came out and forgot all about my Saturn. I had a chance to buy this and jumped on it. The game plays well and the cheesy story is as cheesy as ever. A great game for any Saturn collection and a classic for any Resident evil fan. Some subtle differences throughout the game kept me looking and was defiantly worth another play-through on Sega's forgotten console. Decent graphics, Cheesy but fun story. This was survival horror at it's beginnings"
4,Dr. Sally's Allergy Recipes,"Dr. Sally's book is wonderful for someone who is trying to set-up a rotational diet but needs some direction. The color-coded pages with corresponding recipes are truly idiot-proof. By purchasing this book, you will save yourself countless hours trying to figure out which foods are in the same family and should be included on a specific day, or excluded on a specific day. One shortcoming is that there is not a wide variety of recipes provided. Another good recipe book to get too is ""The Allergy Self-Help Book"" by Marjorie Hurt Jones. Dr. Sally's book will give you a wonderful start for setting up a rotational diet."
3,"No noise, but sound is muffled","This is a great recording of the Carnegie Hall concert, but compared to other labels, the sound is a bit muffled. After purchasing this CD, I discovered the Sony label,Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert, which has the noise and crackling of the original LP. However, the sound is more crisp and authentic. I probably would have purchased the Sony CD if I did not already purchase this one. The Past Perfect label doesn't have any noise, but the sound has less quality. It's adequate, though, for the average listener."
3,Very very lightweight,As others said it is very lightweight. It is really flimsy and I won't say cheap but very close to it.. It is good if you don't need to put anything in it. It is a $200 rack so I guess you get what you pay for.. I would not buy again
5,Impressive,"I'm impressed with this product, and I'd like to obtain more. I don't like the smell much, but it isn't that noticeable. The results are noticeable in a short period of time."
5,Thank you!,I was looking all over for this dvd. Thank you for the speedy delivery and great quality.
2,View on the Double Feature,I was disappinted when I received this item because I wanted the original copy not another version. I really do not like this copy of either movie.
1,He spent time on this?,As a disappointed reader I am surprised if the author spent his valuable time on this project.
4,"Very good, but not great.","Roky Erickson is/was crazy, right? Well...wait until you get a load of his mother. While I definitely do feel sorry for her, her lack of faith in psychiatry displayed in this film almost angers me. Who knows? Maybe Roky could've had a more lucrative career if it wasn't for some of the stuff that happened. If it wasn't for his courageous brother, we might've never even seen this film. Or a completely different/ultra-sad film. Either way, the ending will manage to both depress & make you happy at the same time. A little more live footage would've made this a 5 star DVD."
4,Interesting!,"I missed this when it aired on Sundance and it sounded interesting enough that I bought it. It is a tragic story. Though it centers around Roky Erickson, it shows the deeper tragedy surrounding his entire family."
5,Pure excellence,"In my long life of reading, I have never encountered anything like ""Moonwise"". It is the most extraordinary book I have ever read. I cared passionately about the characters, and laughed at the puns. The plot is almost mythic, and the language is glorious. No other novel comes close. Buy it. Read it. Read it again.And - if you take the time to read passages aloud, it gets even better.I am in awe of this writer."
4,"If you like folk music and folk motif, give it a chance....","I enjoyed this book a great deal (I managed to get a secondhand copy as a gift from a friend). I think it's a truly great example of an almost-lost way of telling tales, and it's daring, and it's a deep, heavy, demanding read. The scope of the tale is traditional -- it's a quest for someone, something valued -- but immense, and sends out roots into balladry and myth and so many other layers of the world. I enjoyed what Ms Gilman did with language, dialect and the voices of her characters. I concede that it's not a quick book, but books weren't always quick."
2,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I couldn`t finish it.,"I saw this movie today at the museum of television and radio because I love the addams family! But this? This family was like the jetsons. No one was cooky, creepy, or even freaky. The characters weren`t fun and they were so boring. If you want to bore yourself and have a horrible time get this movie. I don`t think anyone should be able to watch this show or whatever this is."
1,Ugh - dissapointing.,"I had not remembered seeing any of these cartoons as a child. As an Addams Family fanatic (tv series, movies) I thought I would really enjoy the animated series. Boy, was I wrong. The jokes weren't funny - the animatation was very bland and the voices (except for Fester) were AWFUL. Even the sounds were just typical Hanna Barbara - boring. Imagine taking Scooby Doo, the same type of art work, same bad jokes (which worked great in the Addams Family series and films, but not for this whiney voice used for Gomez in the cartoon) and trying to make Addams Family out of it! Yuck! You wind up with something that would not even be interesting to the average 3 year old. The only good thing I have to say about it is it was so bad that it is saving me money - I feel absolutely NO need to collect/buy the rest of them."
5,Becky's Review,"I thought this was a cute movie. The Addams family have decided to move to New York, and live in Centural Park, where they would own a museam free all the zoo animals, and scare off tourists. But two bad guys are out to get them! So, be sure to check this movie out!"
1,Someone please save us from a sequel,"Dragons are real. And they're among us today. Ooh. Scary.Not.School Library Journal characterizes this book as ""a long series of sword-and-sorcery adventures heavy on action and light on plot-much like a video game, comic strip, or feature-length cartoon written in short sentences and simple language but without the pictures.""Kirkus Reviews states that the book relies on ""lots of spectacular fiery explosions to distract readers from the clunky prose, wooden characters, and nonsensical, cliche-ridden plot.""Yikes.I won't disagree with other reviewers who assert that the premise could have germinated into a book that was readable. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to be the one to carry this out.The author's partisans would have you believe that this is a gem, waiting to be discovered by all fantasy lovers. I would contend that it's pyrite, waiting for less discriminating readers to inadvertantly pick it up, to their eventual dismay."
1,This book is lame,"I have to confess that I didn't finish this book, because I didn't want to waste my time. The story was ridiculous - good fantasy makes you suspend your disbelief. This doesn't qualify as good fantasy, because it was impossible to do this."
3,Could have been better,"I liked the idea driving the plot - dragons exist in the modern world, and they live among us. However, the book failed to grab me, like I hoped it would. The dragons never really developed as a sufficiently scary threat, and the relationships between the main characters did not develop in a realistic way. I'll give it three stars, because it is by a first-time author."
1,Yuck!!!!,"I am a big fan of fantasy, and especially books that have dragons in them. These dragons, as others have noted, aren't like your typical dragons that you find in fantasy books. I think the real difference about them is that they're not in the least bit scary. I couldn't get excited about this book for that reason. It seemed like there were a bunch of times when the main characters should have been toast, but they got away. I would not recommend that you read this!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I wanted to read something good before school started again, and picked up this book because my librarian, who usually recommends good titles, had said it might be good. She had recommended Artemis Fowl, and The Amulet of Samarkand, both of which I loved. This book was boring, however, and not funny at all. The jokes were all stupid, and I couldn't get myself to care about the characters. If you're looking for a good end of summer read, look elsewhere."
5,Wonderfully written! Invetive!,"I have to say, when it comes to dragon books, I am a sucker for them! But in all honesty, I love Simon St. George. He was innocent enough and tragic enough that he wasn't as overwhelming or unbelievable a character as Harry Potter can be.Although the dragons were not as large as they used to be in Mideval times, I still think the author did a great job at making them a menacing presence in the world. I enjoyed the eccentricities of all the dragons and the little things that made them tick. Mr. Hightman did a good job at making them just as much characters throughout the story as Simon, Aldric and Alaythia.I read this book in one day and coudln't put it down. Good job Mr. Hightman!"
1,Unscary dragons and just all around boring,"Most every book about dragons is at least a little frightening. This one doesn't fit into that catergory. The dragons were pretty easily defeated, and weren't all that scary to begin with."
1,Unlikely to enter the pantheon of adequately written fantasy,"This book screams ""the author used his connections to get a book published."" A relationship develops between the main character's father and an artist they pick up along the way in their adventures, which leaves the reader scratching his/her head and thinking ""where did that come from?"" A prime example of bad writing, and a waste of your time given the amount of good fantasy writing out there."
2,Wanted to like it...,"I tried hard to get into this book, cuz it was the last thing I read before I went back to school. It was almost a total letdown, however. It picked up towards the end a bit, but I almost put it down in the beginning because it was so boring."
3,It's okay...but a little boring,"It's okay. It's one of those books where you want to read it once and then give it away. I have every single Sweet Valley Senior Year book and this has to be one of the top three boring. You know what's going to happen. A little predictable. With Evan's parents splitting up and everything, it's good at some parts but some are boring. :)"
5,American Pride,"Ok i for this for my boyfriend and he loved it so he said he did. lol anyways i loved it aswell but the bounes on this is it has an gold plate on the would that says ""American Pride"" i didnt see it on the picture but when i got it. it had it on there! It is a awesome gift or if you collect them i would say get it :)."
5,A READING ADVENTURE !,One of the best motivational books. A very good addition to Rhinoceros Success and Advanced Rhinocerology. We hope that Scott keeps on CHARGING !
1,Unenlightened,"I cannot believe, in this age, one is still able to purchase a book with such hideously backward and uninformed views. The underlying message of the text is profoundly alarming. Alexander is wholly consumed by the hollow notion of the American dream: that, somehow, everybody can succeed if only they worked that bit harder. Unfortunately, life is not so simple. Millions of Americans are born in to poverty; millions die in poverty. Alexander's quasi-religious principles betray his personal background and his simplistic solutions do not address the realities of those who really do need 'motivation'.If you prefer to be comforted by such views as, `It is actually the poor who sponge off the rich,' then this book is for you. But if you have any kind of modern social perception, understanding or awareness, then this book will sicken you as it did me.A disturbing read."
1,No books included,I bought this not realizing that it's just matching tiles. No books were included. I also just realized that books 1 and 2 are not available on amazon. And seems like I can't get them anywhere else. Why carry this product when we can't use it without any books. Am very upset as I live in Asia and doesn't make sense for me to pay for shipping to get it returned to amazon!!
1,If only I could find the books that go with it...,"The frame and tiles are great, unfortunately Educational Insights discontinued making the books that go with it (sold separately) in early 2011. I continue my quest for the books...an impossible task thus far."
2,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know...,"Extremely well documented, amply illustrated. This book is ideal for the serious student of New Orleans transit systems. The general public, or casual reader, will likely find the subject content over whelming."
5,"Great sound, good price",I have four of these as part of my 7.1 surround sound system. The sound quality out of them is very clear and crisp. I have had them for about 3 year now and I am very happy with them.
5,safe jumping!,"I was worried about buying this toy without reading any reviews but it looked like a better quality than the ones available in stores (Target) so I took a chance. I am so glad I did! It is VERY durable, no seams popping or leaks, like the reviews say on the one from Target. We bought it as an alternative to my daughter jumping on the couch. It's working great. This is excellent quality and a great size too, not humongous. We keep it in the play room. I love it!"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"While the quality of the bag is good, it is larger than I anticipated and does not fit well on my 2012 Yamaha. I tried to return the item, but the seller will not pay the return postage AND they will charge a 20% restocking fee because of the charges they have to pay to Amazon. Anticipate never buying an item from this seller again."
1,Zipper defect,"While the name is reputable, and the product seems to be a good value, the main zipper broke after a few uses, I called Kuryakyn, but since the short warranty has expired, I'm on my own! I was told from customer relations to take it to a local shoe repair store or such. It sounded like I was not the first. I reside in a small town and to my disbelief I saw ""TWO"" KURYAKYN bags sitting on the store's shelves to have their ""Waterproof"" Zippers repaired. What a let down from a big name!!"
2,not worth the money,"i paid 600 for this item and was very disapointed.the worst thing was after manualy entering all the movie names a couple weeks later all the info was erased and i had to do it all over again.that happened a few times,and it takes a long time to put all that in.the other thing was the sound quality wasnt as good as my old 5 disk theatre system for 200 dollars.with my cheaper system when it was raining on tv i thought it was raining right next to me.with this system it dont sound that great.bottom line-save ur money."
4,I Keep Buying It,"I didn't start buying this because I'm picky about personal products, or due to a phobia about antiperspirants. I bought it because I was tired of my Ts and wifebeaters getting stained from the residue that antiperspirants leave. In that respect the product has performed well and probably pays for itself. It also has the virtue of being scentless. As a deodorant it's OK, but if you have a stressful day (e.g. being chased by a pack of wild dogs, strangers brandishing handguns, etc.) you'll probably notice that it has stopped working. It comes in a nice package that is sized to be TSA compliant and, for being so small, lasts quite a while. My only complaint is that it feels somewhat greasy when applied.All in all a good product. Like I said, I keep buying it!"
2,Does not keep you dry.,"Sadly this deodorant does not keep you dry. I had the bad experience of wet armpits few time too often with it.As far as smell, it is working fine.Too bad, the brand looks serious."
1,Worse then wearing no deodorant,I was really hoping this would work for me. Regular deodorants make my underarms itch. MenScience Advanced Deodorant generally makes my underarms feel damp and makes any odor worse. Pretty sad that I spent this much money on a deodorant. This stuff might work for some but it doesn't work for me.
2,Menscience Advanced Deoderant,"My underarms still get funky when I use this. Yes, I shower first, but a few hours later on a hot day, my underarms start smelling spicy. My underarms also feel sensitive after wearing this. I've tried it many times, and since I still have it, I will keep trying it periodically until it's gone, seeing that I paid almost $20 for it. Very disappointed."
1,Not the best ....,"After reading such awesome reviews about this pricey product, I decided to purchase this for my hubby. Big mistake! This is my first time ever giving a product a one star review. To put it into simple terms, it did not work."
1,Burns,"Doesn't agree with some people if you read the reviews. I'm one of them... Not sure what it is, maybe high alcohol content or something but it has a dull burning sensation for me that actually makes me sweat."
1,Burned my underarms!,"I tried Tom's deodorant before but didn't think that it lasted all day so I read all the great reviews and got this product. About 20 minutes after I applied it to my underarms, they would begin to itch and burn. It would then go away and I wouldn't think about it again. I wasn't sure if I needed to get used to a new product so I continued to use it for 5 days - not a good idea. Now my underarms are peeling, dry, and very sore! I am moving onto a new product and am bummed I spent $17 on this!"
5,Amazing Deodorant,"This is an amazing product! I can't use an antiperspirant because of irritation and the deodorants I have tried failed miserably after a few hours. This product works all day and into the night. Even after 24 hours, it is still working. Under extreme conditions there is a slight odor but that is due to the clothing not the deodorant failing. So far there have been no problems with irritation and I am very happy with the results. Even though it is more expensive (by a lot) I would recommend it to anyone who has an odor problem and does not want or can't use one of the aluminum based antiperspirant products."
2,ok if you are not active,"if you do any walking, exposed to temperatures above 70 for more than a few minutes or in generla sweat...you will smell. while its great that it is aluminum free, and thus the 2 stars, this is really only for inactive people.....mind you I have an office job. look at arm and hammer essentials"
4,Salty.... then sweet?,"Really digging this deodorant. I have found it difficult to find a natural product that works for me. I care about being a healthy human and really don't like to use or eat processed crap. I admit that I have to use Right Guard Clinical Strength during a very active day though... or night out. MenScience is great. I always give myself a smell check after putting it on and it smells salty. Then it goes away and smells like nothing. Not great with the perspiration, but controls the smell and makes you feel clean. Overall, would recommend the product. Worth the price."
5,Excellent deodorant!,The deodorant stops odor all day. Does not stop wetness as well but it is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. The deodorant is pricey when you consider product cost plus shipping. I still prefer this product to anything else at this point.
4,RJ,I have tried numerous natural deodorants and prior to using MenScience the only one that worked for me was one I had purchased in Australia. Great product.
4,ViewMaster,My grandson is 4 and he had no problem using it. He was delighted to see his favorite 'Cars' at his choosing.
2,Flamingo toy,"Within ten minutes of use, by a dog who is not rough with toys, it came open at the bottom, where the legs attach to the body. She still likes it, but have had to sew it a couple of time."
4,IT'S O.K.,The pads are ok but dont expect the bounces off like a groung pounder. The padding is softer so it just absorbs the impact.Empire Ground Pounder SE Youth Chest Protector - Black
4,NOT BAD FOR THE GRAPHICS THAT SATURN HAD,"WOW IBOUHT THIS GAME LAST WEEK ON A YARD SALE WITH THE SEGA SATURN.FIRST I OWN A PLAYSTATION 1 WITH QUAKE 2 AND IAM A BIG FAN OF QUAKE GAMES AND I PLAYED THE SEGA SATURN VERSION AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH THAT I PLAYED ALL SUNDAY,THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT THAT BAD IS A LTTLE DARK THAN OTHR QUAKE GAMES BUT MAKES IT MORE CREPPY LKE IT WHEN YOU GET TO THE BIG BOSS SPIDERNECTOR HE IS THE BIGGEST FEAR YOU WILL EVER FOUHGT ON A VIDEO GAME...I RECOMEND YOU BUYING THIS GAME IT WILL MAKE YOUR SEGA SATURN CHALENGE YOUR PLAYSTATION 1..."
5,American as it gets.,Pure full blown American made music. The mix is great and I can't seem stop playin it 3 years later.
5,Overlooked by Slayer and Unearth releases...but...,"This album is incredible...I bought this album today with the new Slayer, but let me tell you something this album is packed with full speed and good musicianship. These guys blends metalcore, death metal and thrash in a perfect combination. There's no breakdowns here, good guitar riffs and impress drumming. Try this album and you won't regret it!!!"
5,i wet myself.....,well what is there to say.....well we all know it if we heard it but this band is killer. the name speaks for itself. im wondering if they could ever top this release and it is only their second album. The first cd was done very well also but I like the style they have now and their new singer is truly gifted with the vocal. awesome band pick it up now.
3,poursite,"A very nice watch in all respects except one; the digital numbers are very faint. They can't be see in low light. However, it is slim, easy to use,handsome and inexpensive."
2,Warning,"You won't see this in the advertising...anywhere...but at the moment (and probably permanently) Mac Generals and PC Generals cannot play together online. So, if you are getting this game to play with your PC using friends on your Mac, just forget about it.[...]"
5,A,"This is one way to approach this contentious subject. There is the epidemiological method and the advocacy/feminist approach. this is the former. It is well written and with some basic knowledge of statistics it can be understood. There are no outrageous claims as the stats ate treated with critical realism. it gives some very useful facts about the extent,the impact, the solutions for those victims affected and the ways forward for further research.this topic is very current and I suggest that those who are commenting in public should read this before ""sounding off"". the may see it along other texts which are referred to in the book."
2,Just not accurate,"Inaccurate. The same issues that plague cheaper scales. I might accept this if it was a $20 scale, but it isn't. A scale this price should at least be able to produce accurate weight readings.Do not buy if you can find something comparable with good accuracy."
2,not accurate,"pretty but not accurate. can be 5 pounds different day to day, or even am to pm. body fat can flucuate 5% in one day which is not normal. BIA is not the gold standard in body fat measurement, which means it has a larger margin of error, but at least the scale could be accurate. it's not. i'm returning this item."
3,Random Recollections,What's amazing to me is that Henry Brewster Stanton selected these recollections and forgot to mention anything but once about his wife Elizabeth Cady Stanton! What a supportive husband!
4,"another ""D"" is added to the !!","this book gives another dimentition to the understanding of animation, it goes more into the philosophical use and representation ideas of creationg both formas and spaces in digital reality"
3,Whose Life is it Anyway?,"An okay book that gives us another perspective on possibly the greatest comedy team of all time (no apologies to the Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello or Martin and Lewis). The Stooges have outlasted all the rest. However, the perspective is from a partial outsider- Larry Fine's brother. You come away thinking that he had much to do with their success.What is missing are some hard facts. Everyone knows the famous incident where Larry had procured one movie contract deal in 1934 when Moe overruled him and took the Columbia deal. But this is only alluded to here without all the details. This is something that should have been better explored.Interestingly, even if Harry Cohn did not give them as much as they deserved for the 8 two reelers they made each year, they made plenty on the vaudeville stage as a result of their movie notoriety.I give it a 3 of 5 because there is some new information brought to light but it could have been better told."
5,I love Joan!,"Joan Lunden is such a perfect person to write a book like this. She's a mom, a professional, and keeps fit and healthy! Read this book!"
1,Narcassitic Drivel,"I have always been a fan of Joan Lunden, but this tape is nothing more than narcissistic musing of her path to growth supported by The Golden Gate Spa and a high dollar fitness club in New YorkThe tape contributed no new or practical knowledge which one could make use of on their own path to growth."
4,Great price for lighting gels,"The gels are priced right and work well. I used the blue and green for my yearly haunt for both LED and flood lights and they did the job. Easy to cut and fit to your light source. The heat of one American DJ PAR 38 Can light did melt part of one gel, but for the price I'm not going to complain. The blue is very dark so if you're looking to let more light through check out some lighter gel shades."
3,sasquatches from outer space,I thought this book was very interesting. I never really believed in sasquatch and other legends but this book made me sit down and really think about what these things are. This book shows that some things are real and some things aren't. I think this book would be interesting for anyone from the ages nine to 13. Even for some older kids that are interested in this sort of thing. For kids in grade three or lower this book may be to old for them. The author gave very discriptive words in this book. Because I do not read a lot about U.F.O.s this was a great learning experience. This book also showed two points of view. Thank You
2,Be careful when buying bulk grocery item!,I bought Reese Artichoke Bottoms in February 2009 on Goldbox deal from Amazon. The artichokes that I received were fine but they were too close to expiration date and I had to use them right away. Please consider if you are planning on saving them for much later use.
2,Some are tough,Like I read on another reviewer's summary - some of the artichoke hearts were tough and I had to discard parts of the hearts. Not the best quality I have had. What they should have done was trim them a little more so that the hard tough parts were not there - I guess they wanted to cheap it out a little and include parts that would have been thrown out if you were making them from fresh Artichokes. I liked that they were not in oil but I did have to wash some of them because they did have a salty flavor.
4,Can vs Frozen,"When I bought Reese Artichoke Hearts, it was less than $25/case and I didn't want to pay for shipping so I had one of my friend bought one for herself with me. It worked out great, the shipping was speedy and ate them fairly quickly since the experation date was quite close. However, It didn't bother me that much since I paid so much less than I normally pay for them at a grocery store.But one thing that I realized was these canned Artichoke isn't as good as Frozen ones.I didn't really notice it until I heard many chefs on TV would say things like ""use the fresh artichoke if you could, but if it's not available, use frozen one or those ones in a jar. Not the canned ones."" So after I finished with my 12 cans, I started to use the frozen artichoke and I think it actully taste better. Frozen ones don't have that sourness in them. Or maybe it is just me....or just those celebrity chefs on TV...."
3,produce of PERU,"If you're looking for US grown organic produce, then pass this by. Don't know how the artichokes are raised or what pesticides were used....hmmmm.... says nothing about PERU in the product description. This was not produce of Spain as advertised.The positive (why it did deserve 3 points): Taste is good, albiet fairly bland compared to other brands/options. Good for pasta salad if you add dressing."
5,An amazing compilation to this day!!!,There are two things that make this worth it.1. Playing with the first 3d created Sonic.2. Playing Sonic the hedgehog with SPIN DASH enabled!!!!!!!!These two things ALONE make the game worthwhile.I'm glad I bought one before amazon ran out.
1,DO NOT BUY!,DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU COLLECT OLD GAME SYSTEMS. FOR THOSE WITH NEWER SYSTEMS YOU CAN GET THE SONIC GAMES FOR THOSE SYSEMS.
1,Thomas Box,"The tin on this is SO flimsy unfortunately. The clasp doesnt stay attached when being carried, the box flops right open. I expected more from this and am 100% dissapointed in it. Unfortunately the ground shipping was extremely slow and it arrived ON my sons birthday before I could really get a chance to inspect it over. :("
4,Soviet Deception and Surprise Action,"Soviet Deception and Surprise ActionRaymond Garthoff's ""Soviet Military Doctrine"" some interesting information on deception operations. Chapter 16, entitled ""Deception, Surprise, and Security,"" describes the place of deception in Soviet military doctrine. Passages on deception in Soviet field regulations and other publications are quoted. Examples of successful Soviet deception operations during World War II are presented."
5,Very Good,"There's more between the covers of this unassuming book than you would guess from its small price. Lots of specific medical advice for conditions to which older dogs are prone, all presented in easy-to-understand language. I would heartily suggest this book to owners of older dogs."
5,Daisy Fay Delivers,"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read, if not the funniest. Great for a gift or for an introduction to the work of the author, Fannie Flagg. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Love Fannie Flagg...,"She is a wonderful Southern story teller. Her characters have warmth and everything wonderful in life, with some spice mixed in. It's books like these that are hard to put down and sad when they end."
3,Passing,"Fanny Flagg feeds many people's prejudice of small towns encompassing all that is good and large cities harboring all that is evil. In contrast in FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE, the town characters and situations depicted are more realistic and believeable. Flagg needs to recapture this quality in her writing to make her next book as memorable and worthwhile ."
4,"Wild, witty, and wonderful.","Eleven-year-old Daisy Fay Harper is the sassy narrator of Fannie Flagg's debut novel. Documenting her experiences growing up in a tiny Mississippi beach town, Daisy Fay writes with indomitable humor, charm, and pluck. Fannie Flagg has an amazing talent for creating true-to-life (yet marvelously zany) characters, and Daisy Fay and her town are no exception.The only problem? Flagg appears to lose interest once Daisy Fay hits high school. Things take a turn for the worse - both in Daisy Fay's life and in the writing. Things aren't as detailed, and the older Daisy Fay lacks much of the smart alecky quality of her younger counterpart.Still, a more than worthwhile read."
4,Any book that shows it's characters attending Jr. Debutante,Any book that has it's characters attending Jr. Debutante meeting in the back of a bait store has got my vote for a funny well written piece of work. This book made me laugh many times and I finished it in two days as I couldn't put it down. At times the writer would be writing something and it was almost as if they didn't realize that it was so knee slapping funny. A great read !
4,Daisy Mae and the Miracle Man,A quick easy read. Fannie Flagg offers a light hearted look at a by-gone era and laugh out loud humor. I have read all of her other novels and this one didn't disappointed. All of her books are worth the time.
5,The Perfect Remedy,"I read this book when I was 14, and I cracked up so many times I lost count. I lent it to many people, and they all found it to be a great read on a breezy summer day. You'll laugh so hard you want to cry. Flagg's ability to enter the mindset of a young Southern girl is refreshing and amazingly correct. Read this book if you're in a bad mood - I can guarantee it will have you feeling better in no time!"
4,Big Fannie Flagg fan,I love all of Fannie's books. Everyone of them is worth reading. I should know -I have read them all.
4,Liked it,A great book but not Fannie Flagg's best. It was very funny but I didn't laugh out loud as much as others I've read. I would still recommend it though.
5,Must read,"I read this book many years ago and just remembered how much I loved it. It runs the entire range of emotions, you laugh you cry, and just fall in love with Daisy Fay."
5,Good Reading,"Book arrived in just a few days after purchase, was in better condition than described, I had read this book several years ago and wanted to always have a copy to keep, Daisy Fay brought back such good childhood memories."
5,Wonderful read. I love all Fannie Flagg's books!,"A wonderful read. I love all Fannie Flagg's books! She's a fine author who writes books that stick, full of hope and humor."
5,A Fanny Flagg book is guaranteed entertainment,A professor at Compton Community College included a bit of this book in her recently published anthology. I am embarrassed to admit that I was laughing out loud while reading it on bus and train. There was nothing I could do about it because this book is just that funny!
4,This is one of the funniest books I've ever read!,"Set a spell and listen as Daisy Fay tells the story of her life. From when she and her family leave Jackson, Mississippi to move to run an ice cream shop in Florida, where, in the winter, her father freezes animals to stuff to make more money. Read as she's ""healed"" by the miracle man in the most hilarious scene I've ever read! Read as her long lost grandfather, helps her to win the Miss Florida or Mississippi or Alabama crown. Against all odds, Daisy Fay manages to keep a postive, joyful, attitude, despite some pretty bad situations not of her own making.This is a heartwarming, well-written book, read it, you'll laugh until it hurts! Fannie Flagg is a genius, read her books in order, Daisy Fay first, Fried Green Tomatoes second, and finally Welcome to the World, Baby Girl. This is time used wisely!"
3,Recipe: Some Spice But Something Missing,"Fannie Flagg's latest book is an enjoyable, easy read with an ending that might surprise you. The story revolves around Dena Nordstrom, a talented, beautiful news woman who, although SHE doesn't seem to know it, is searching for herself. In addition to Dena there are many other characters who could have been interesting, but who were not fully developed. Several intriguing themes, such as ""good news vs bad news"" in the media and the ""existence of God"" add some spice to the book, but if you are looking for another FRIED GREEN TOMATOES...look elsewhere."
1,Very disappointing!,"I have appreciated Fannie Flagg's unique humor since the days of Jack Paar. This book just doesn't measure up. It was a ""page-turner""; I kept turning pages hoping that something interesting, or somewhat intellectually challenging would appear. No luck!!!"
2,The miracle man doesn't delivers.,"This novel was originally issued under the title ""Coming Attractions."" I have the feeling Flagg was trying to ride the wave of the success of ""Fried Green Tomatoes..."" and reissued this book under the new - and longer - title. Unfortunately, Fannie flags here, weaving a loose fabric of weak characters that never grabbed me or made me care about them. Full of mediocre plot twists, the story follows an old rainbow to an empty pot as Daisy Fay not so much hunts for but rides like a piece of driftwood into the stagnant and sluggish backwaters of success and acceptance."
5,Daisy Fay,I loved this book. I wanted to take Daisy Fay home with me. It was a solid read. I enjoy books from that era and I especially enjoy Fannie Flagg!
3,Wonderfully read!,"This review refers to the abridged audio cassette version. Fanny Flagg gives a marvelous reading of her novel; one really feels that Daisy Fay herself is narrating her diary. It's a shame, though, that the producers elected to squeeze the entire novel onto two cassettes as it loses so much by not being complete. Some of the best passages have been omitted, and some events which occur later in the cassette version don't have the impact they should because the earlier events to which they refer have been left out. One gets the feeling that Ms. Flagg read the entire novel, and the producers selected the excerpts they needed to fill two cassettes while still making a modicum of sense. The cassettes are delightful to listen to, but bear in mind that the term ""abridged"" is not to be taken lightly!"
5,A very fun read!,"I had trouble putting this down. It was such fun to read. I had not read anything by Fannie Flagg before, but this book will get me looking for more!"
4,A Charming Novel,"As always, Fannie Flagg writes with wit and gives us an endearing protagonist. Loved the story as told through a young girl's perception. There are some truly laugh out loud moments! Enjoyed this book!"
5,"Wonderful, entertaining and thought-provoking.",This is a great book about America as it used to be. I recommend it for all.
5,Daisy Fay is the absolute best book I have ever read!,"I have bought countless copies of this book, not just as gifts but also for me. I have loaned my copies to friends who then loan them to friends and so on, which is just fine with me. I am now buying another copy for my 15 year old daughter because my 19 year old loaned her (2nd) copy to a friend who loaned it to a friend...A wonderful rainy day book!"
4,Very entertaining. I only put it down once.,"Daisy is quite a gal. She will make you laugh and make you cry. I liked it better than ""Fried Green Tomatoes"". If you need a good laugh, give Daisy a try."
1,What a flaming piece of junk,"I was desparate for something to listen to this week so grabbed this at the local library. Read the Amazon reviews and they seemed great. This book is totally worthless. Somebody had the audacity to say it was the funniest book ever? What do you normally read - physics textbooks? A total and absolute waste of my time. Had maybe 3 funny parts in the entire thing. The only reason I finished it was because it is so short and I figured with so many good reviews SOMETHING must happen SOMEWHERE. I was wrong. I don't think I've ever regretted a book before. Well, there's a first time for everything."
5,A laugh on every page.,"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man by Fanny Flagg was probably the funniest book I've ever read. Not only is it funny, it is well written and has a great story line. Daisy Fay also features some great, believable, and lovable characters which is a trademark of Fanny flagg. Basically, we follow the life of Daisy Fay Harper, a 12 year old girl living in Mississippi. We watch Daisy grow from a rough 12 year old tomboy to a 17 year old actress. Daisy also deals with some more serious problems such as her dad's drinking habits and her parent's divorce. All in all, this is definatly one of my favorite books by Flagg and one of my all time favorites."
5,This book cracked me up!!,"What a hilarious novel! I have never laughed so hard while reading a book in my entire life. Fannie Flagg is gifted. She made the characters come to life for me. Daisy Fay is the friend I wish I had in high school, if not for companionship but for the crazy, fun-filled memories. DAISY FAY AND THE MIRACLE MAN is a wonderful pick-me-up and such a pleasure to read. Thank you Ms. Flagg for creating such a fantastic story!"
5,WONDERFUL!!,"I thought that this book was incredible!!! I would read it on the bus on my way to work, and laugh in uncontrolable bursts!! ( making my fellow riders look at me strangely). However, underlying this hilarious story is a serious and sometimes sad tale of a little girl growing up in a very dysfunctional family, and dysfunctional world....if this story were told by anyone but Ms. Flagg, it would be a sad."
5,Splendid!,"Paul O'Dette continues to fulfill his calling magnificently (and the audience gets to reap the reward), for all this outstanding, gilded lute work.Elegantly performed and presented with excellent studio sound quality/backdrop effect.Splendid and gentle, festive luteny, perfectly realized.Five star rated.Ken Cybulska"
5,I really loved this book,"I just finished it and am praying there are more books by the same author. (Amazon shows none.) With the curious, thoughtful mind of a truth-seeker, she takes us inside a Buddhist monastery where everyone, including the lama (sort of like the mother superior) is a middle-class American. They're nice people, a little lost like the rest of us, trying to find meaning in their lives. Adventures and mysteries unfold. The first half is happy and so inspiring, as we get to know the characters and how they became Buddhists. Then the plot thickens as the lama turns out to have flaws (a lot like some of the gurus I personally have known). The ending is totally inspiring. It reads like a great & elegantly written novel, but this monastery really exists and the author is telling us what she found there. Made me hungry to know more about the kind & soulful people, the Buddhists, who are at the heart of this terrific book. I feel like I know them all!"
4,Dharma Bummed,"The Buddha From Brooklyn is captivating account about the cult of personality surrounding Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo, the spiritual leader of the largest Buddhist monastery in the United States.A quick read, the book is by all accounts a balanced and unbiased expose of the cult-like devotion and absolute corruption within this seemingly peaceful environment. Jetsunma's greed and hypocrisy makes Jim Baker look positively christ-like.Share this with your friends and family."
3,Part One,I'm about to purchase this book to learn more of Jetsumna. My husband of 2.5 years just left me upon her recommendation.
3,Buddha?,"Real-life accouont of an author's time spent with a great group of people led by a gal, in my opinion, who has strayed as far from The Path as is possible, if she has ever trod it in the first place, and is trapped in the vise of abject materialism. The writing, effort and research, however, are superb, except for the pop culture allusions, which I despise."
2,Review from a Buddhist practitioner,"""Buddha from Brooklyn"" is a medocre biography in my opinion. Although it seems Ms. Sherrill is intrigued by the Buddhist religion and her work on the book has drawn her toward it, too much of the book focuses on the superficial and sensational aspects of this particular teacher rather than the contents and quality of her teachings, temple and the works of her students. Even the stories of her devoted students are superficial compared to the details she shares about a few disgruntled former students. It just didn't feel like balanced journalism to me. If it had been a novel it would have been a heck of a read. As a non-fiction title it is shallow at best."
2,Not much fun to read,"Should an artist's personal life be taken into account when judging his work? This book is mostly about Jetsunma's and her student's personal lives and very little about their work. The amount of time spent describing negative incidents becomes depressing. As the author says herself, maybe she is holding these people to a different standard when she is critical of a nun having her own coffee pot in her room. Nuns should be more communal, I guess. Gossip and scandalous details can be intriguing but a steady diet of it is just not much fun to read."
5,Dharma or Doormat,"In The Buddha from Brooklyn, reporter Martha Sherill, explores the life of Jetsunma Akhon Lhamo Rinpoché, an American born woman of Italian and Jewish Heritage, a former New Age Guru, who was recognized as the reincarnation of a Buddhist saint.As the story unfolds there are secrets, and mysteries. Sometimes it's hard to believe that this story is (at least for the most part) very true.For more information on Jetsunma's group, Kunzang Payul Choling, check out ..........................for HH Penor Rinpoché's Website and the Palyul Lineage."
3,A cult that looks like Tibetan Buddhism,"The book describes a cult leader and her following, who one day decided they were Tibetan buddhists. The author does a great job of describing the goings-on of this cult but has no real insight into any buddhist tradition, tibetan or otherwise. Nowhere does one see the very basic observation of the mind and the delusions it creates, which all traditions deal with. And various items about tibetan buddhism are wrong, such as the nature of a tulku (merely a rebirth of a lama, certainly not infallibe.) This book is NOT about Tibetan buddhism or any buddhism of any sort. People who want to learn about buddhism should NOT take this as guidance."
5,Black thumbs be gone!,"This is probably not a book for more experienced gardeners... but luckily I'm not. The writing on the design aspect of the non-garden seems common sense (and it is), but the book is a real treasure for the beginning gardener and those of us who just have two left thumbs. This is because it includes basic guides on such diverse topics as: plant biology, planting (from rock gardens to hanging plants), caring for the plant, propagation and pest control. Guides to planting and plant maintenance include diagrams and step-by-step instruction for easy use. The book's best feature though is its lovely photography; the photos are intended to inspire the reader with ideas about the design of their no-garden garden."
1,could be better,"For the money, I can't complain too bitterly. The blade is diamond cross section only on the top half, the last third of the blade is paper thin and way too floppy. Had I known this I'd have gotten a different sword. The steel seems to be of reasonable quality but the pommel and grip are subject to loosening (an easy fix). I really should have known that any blade this inexpensive would not be terribly good but I had expected a stiffer blade which is why I had purchased the diamond section blade. Were the blade thicker and stiffer, I'd have been very happy as it really is quite inexpensive. It isn't a bad buy as long as you realize the blade will be paper thin and you expect that."
3,Forget that old time religion,"The title is not so provocative today. You only have to turn on your TV set anytime of the day and there are programs galore on covering the markets and investing. Clearly, economics and the scientific disciplines have filled in the void left by religion, at least in the western democracies. Let's hope we don't turn the economic model into a god that time immemorial has already shown is not worthy of human adoration. This isn't to say we shouldn't pay attention to economics, clearly it has an important place in our lives."
5,"Lyrical, evocative and heartfelt","I picked up this book, not knowing what to expect. 11 hours later, I finished it -- barely able to set it down. It was an amazing exploration of the relationship between mothers and daughters that I've ever read -- yet it speaks to all of us in terms of its analysis of the human spirit. I can't wait to read another one of Claudia Ricci's novels."
5,Amazing story in exacting detail,"Wow, many have seen the news stories or heard the name on a news story that proliferated for the bulk of the year. I doubt anyone has even the most remote idea of how much content & detail they have never heard. This book compeled me so much. I started to read it on a Sunday night as I was going to bed...I didn't go to sleep! I stayed up all night and read the book straight though Monday, I missed a day of work and it was well worth it. If you have any interest in the truth you will feel as if you have every detail you could possibly gleen. Never felt Monotonous or boring. I now feel like I could give a lecture on this enigma. I don't want to give away the real details that I discovered in this book, I want you to feel the same excitement I felt as I zipped detail to juicy detail. The last time I felt that into a story was when I read all the presidents men. I was captivated for 2 days and now I feel enlightened and enriched for the time I spent with this book."
4,Vegas Book Review,Excellent overall day by day scenario leading up to and after the removal of Elian Gonzalez. Covers the political structure of Cuba under the dictator Fidel Castro and the ties to the U.S. under the Clinton Administration. Legal information not revealed before in connection with the Cuban Adjustment Act is worth storing in any law library.
1,Right wing trash,If I could give this book a negative rating of 100 I would do so. This is the paranoid right wing at its worst. It is full of misinformation and complete nonsense. I have followed the story very carefully and this is complete distortion--sometimes laughable in its ridiculousness such as the claim that Elian is not the child of Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Don't waste your time or money on such trash.
1,Don't Wast Your Money if you're looking for Catholic teaching,The previous review by Tevington says it better than I.This book has nothing to offer someone who is looking for authentic Catholic teaching. Save your money.It is deceptive and misleading.The authors ought to be sued for false advertisement.
5,Another great video from Deb,"My wife has been into arts and crafts for a while. We've already used some of the advice from Deborah's video for candle making, and we wanted to see what she had to say about basket making.What can I say, she nailed it. Her attention to detail in the videos makes it so anyone can follow what she is doing. I have a feeling that how-to books will be quickly migrating to how-to videos like this.Thanks Deb!"
1,Not worth the money,"This book is not worth the money. I just started doing research for my business and this book did not offer me one ""common sense"" thing I didn't already know. She talks more about opening legal clinics than about making gift baskets.The presentation of the book is embarrasing. There are mistakes everywhere including alot of text that was left out. Topics jump around. The pictures of gift baskets that are included are so grainy you cannot possibly learn how to do anything from them. Spend your money on something better!"
3,The frangrance wears off,"I love paris hilton perfume/ however the fragrance wears off withing hours of spraying it on.so for the price of paris I no longer buy this stuff,its not worth the price they sell it for..I now use Marc Jacobs daisy this stays on all day and smells awesome!"
2,Entertaining but hard to believe.,"When you write about one of the greatest rock bands ever, you have the potential to make alot of money if you make the story interesting enough. I think that's what Sanchez was doing here; mixing just enough lies with the truth to come up with great copy. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell the fluff from the real stuff which is sad, because I'll bet the actual true account of the Stones would be even better! As they say, ""Truth is stranger than fiction."""
4,"probably true, in most aspects","read this in one day, fascinating events, lots of info on the music, repetitive accounts of heroin and coke usage ,more in depth analysis of altamont than film showed,appears knows toomuch of some conversations when he wasnt even there tho.still a good read and it was not extraordinary from the hippie culture of the late 60s and early 70s, introduces a closer role tweenbeatles and stones then was evident at the time, does not evenmention hendrix in london or such heavies as animals,and pink floyd ,still a b plus book, however, why did he spill his gutson what are basically private matters of close friends ?"
4,The great Rolling Stones!,"It's only rock n roll, but I like it.Unafraid to spin a good story out of everything that happened andnot sugar coat or hide the raw 'truth.' Funny as hell too.Good book."
5,Amazing!,"Few could write about the selfish lowlifes who call themselves the Rolling Stones with such credibility. Every word is gripping and believable, and beautifully written. Tony's casual writing style is incredible. The best rock bio I've ever read, and I've read dozens!"
5,A great decadent read...,"I really enjoyed this book. I read it after reading Keith's latest which I found really dull about half way thru.This tome I think it more truthfull and gives a true picture of addiction in all its colours, but particularly the darker ones."
4,Up and down with the Rolling Stones,"I purchased this book as a gift for someone. It was rather difficult to find, since it is out of print. I was happy with all phases of the transaction."
5,Still a Hot Seller,"This book was first issued in 1979.It was a very interesting book as it included Brian Jones. As Brian was the founder of the band, it is refreshing to read about him.It includes Mick Taylor. Very talented but not as captivating or as gifted as Brian Jones."
4,best surf book,"Most surf books are small waves breaking in shallow water, this guy sees beyond horizon."
4,A collection that includes a number of interesting songs,"This disc includes a number of songs that may be of value and interest. In particular, there are two versions of the song ""The Cat Came Back."" The first version (on track 1 of the disc) includes a number of verses that are often associated with the song (i.e. ""...The man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight..."") The other version, ""The Cat Came Back (Again),"" has different verses and a more louder rhythm, among other aspects. As the other songs go, ""John Russel Watkins"" is an interesting (and maybe surprising) tale about a character who encounters a ghost and some other supposedly scary creatures. ""My Grandfather's Clock"" is a somewhat oldish song that combines rhythm and an interesting verse. The song ""Jack Was Every Inch A Sailer/The Sailor's Hornpipe"" tells about the adventures of a seafaring young man, and includes a bit of instrumental music."
3,Good supplement to your other review materials,"I picked this book up as a supplement to my other study materials and as a quick reference guide, this is a decent book. Although it doesn't go into any great detail, it does touch on a number of subjects. Although I haven't taken the 70-290 exam yet, I did find more coverage of topics that are covered by the 70-291 exam, which were absent from those books. The book also comes with a CD containing a MasterSim exam, which has over 200 questions. I wouldn't use this for a stand-alone study guide, but I haven't found a book yet that could stand up to that challenge... Summary: brief and to the point."
4,Nice. Primary book!,"This is a good book to have in your collection. These Passport books are great. Gives you enough to pass the test, and then some. I used this as my primary book for the test, plus CBT videos, and test lab in the house. Also throw in a study guide, and practice test, and you should be good. When studying just practice the things you are learning over and over, and you you should be good for the test. This makes a good reference as well."
2,supplemental only,"Do not rely upon this book only. You will be disappointed. Also, the book assumes that the reader already has knowledge of this server. Statements like ""spend some time looking at the group policies"" are supposed to help. Come on there are over 160 group policies on the 2003 Server. I have taken the 70-290 twice and did worse the second time. The night before I reread most of this book which I don't think helped much. I really haven't found anything that matches the last test that I took (70-290).I wish that I could find something that matches what Microsoft does on test day.Don't rely on any one book."
4,Guided relaxation CD,"i am into the Guided meditation CD's, and i thought that this one was going to fill that bill, it is a good CD and good for relaxing, but not totally what i needed...thank."
3,Guided Relaxation ?,"This is a nice, relaxing CD to listen to. However, I find that to truly unwind, the hypnosis relaxation Cd's will take you to deeper state and a more relaxed experience. Although I wouldn't purchase it again, it IS a nice CD."
2,Disappointed,"Although her voice is relaxing, the effects that they do with it is distracting. The speaker's voice is echoed in some parts and plays on opposite sides of your headphones at varying times, which I found to not be relaxing, but amusing. After listening to this cd for 15 minutes, I could no longer stand it, it was the opposite of relaxing for me. Would not reccommend!!"
5,Upgrades,"My daughter just upgraded from Version 6 to this and loves this version. At first she wanted to keep Ver. 6 on her old computer because she needed the ""safety net"" of familarity and ease of use in that version just in case she didn't feel as comfortable with the upgrade. She erased the Ver. 6 because she likes this version so much!!! She is using it for her upcoming wedding and all that that intails!"
5,Great product!,I have an older version of Printshop and upgraded to this one. I am primarily using it for scrapbooking purposes.It is very easy to use and has a lot of user options.
4,Little known but outstanding.,"While I'll freely admit that the singer's (David Surkamp) voice isn't for everybody, it fits in very well with the soaring, artsy sound that Pavlov's Dog creates.This is a very tight, talented band. A tight rhythm section of Rick Stockton (bass) and Mike Safron (percussion) provides a rock solid base for the variety of sounds created by the keyboards, violins, flutes and other instruments featured on these two recordings.""Episode"" off of ""Pampered Menial"" ranks as my favorite, but there are so many stellar songs on both these CD's that if you enjoyed acts such as Jethro Tull, or Yes...then you can't go wrong here.Do yourself a favor and take Pavlov's Dog home soon!"
5,Unforgettable,"I first heard these albums in 1978 when a friend of mine was pushing all sorts of music at me. Initially I preferred At The Sound Of The Bell (Standing Here With You being my favourite) but I soon graduated to the harder-rocking first album. It seems everyone has different opinions on their favourites - mine is Theme From Subway Sue, on which Surkamp's vocals are absolutely astonishing, and there is gorgeous country-rock-inflected piano and some excellent lead guitar playing.Get these albums if you can. Proof that the 70's weren't all bad taste and flares! The music is timeless and even now if marketed properly would do well on general sale... It's REAL music, played and produced well, by people who knew what they were doing, and, of course, Surkamp's utterly, utterly unique voice. Only Geddy Lee of Rush comes anywhere close but it's not really a fair comparison.There are two other albums that I know of plus a bootleg of a live radio show, but these are of the 'for-fans-only' type."
5,"Have Time, Will Travel -- Ronald McDonald","Little boys will love this show. When my older son was little. he had one tape and watched it over and over. Now my younger son has all the episodes and also loves them. Neither of them knew who Ronald McDonald was, but that didn't matter, they still absolutely loved them."
5,Save time and Space!,"I've rated employees for over 30 years using various forms and formats that require specific documentation of skills, attitudes and potential. This is a tool providing focus with clear, concise word pictures."
5,Very Helpful,"I am going back into management after many years and this is a great ""crash course"" and reference tool. I highly recommend it!"
1,Mind numbing,"This is the first book I ever thew in the garbage. It was so bad that my teenager and I read parts outloud for laughs.Here is an example of a PERFECT PHRASE on how to break bad news to the boss:""I just have made what might be a career-limiting move."""
5,Brilliant,"The book gave me useful, practical, no-nonsense tips on how to deal with common conflicts I face as a manager. It's easy to read and introduces levity into an otherwise dry and serious topic. I found myself laughing several times. The phrases can be easily adapted to nearly any situation. I loved it!"
4,Classic Horner,"The talents of James Horner mesh wonderfully with the etherial theme of Brainstorm. The listener is taken on a ride from suspense to sorrow to elation, all while in the gentle embrace of Horner's skill. It really is a shame that this CD is so hard to find these days."
3,an acquired taste...,"Sorry to say, this music is not my cup of tea. It seems a bit dull and unobtrusive, rarely toe tapping in any shape or form. After a time, I found myself wanting to put on something else. Still, the music is well performed by one of the great early instrument ensembles. I do enjoy music for viols, but this music just may be a bit too ""early"" for me. If you appreciate this genre, you might wish to audition prior to purchase."
1,Mistake,"I, too, have happlily used earlier versions of Print Shop. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing Print Shop 21 Deluxe. After installing, my computer crashed while I was trying to insert a border onto a page. I then attempted to restart my computer and it took forever to come back up. Thereafter, I uninstalled the program and am hopeful my computer will function properly. Don't waste your money on this program."
1,Printshop 21,The item arrived in a new box. However no CD's were in box only an empty case. What kind of a rip-off are you pulling. I was away when item came so just recently found out.
1,Hindsight is 20/20,"I wish I had seen all of these other reviews before purchasing mine, which came with a rebate. I too have issues w/ the mail merge and image gallery functions. Broderbund is no help whatsoever, yet they constantly urge you to upgrade and purchase more of their products. I would have to be out of my mind to do it. I am looking for another graphics program. Any suggestions would be gratefully appreciated."
3,Print Shop 21 Deluxe,"Program does not really work well with my computer, as it loads without the menu items on the left side of the program. They have a fix that does not work and they have quit providing support for this version.Save your self aggravation and get a program that will work."
4,Borderless Printing with Epson R300 series printer,"I purchased Print Shop 21 (Standard) for one reason and one reason only: Borderless printing. I'm sure there are other packages out there that can do the same thing but it was time to upgrade PS anyway. I selected borderless printing in the Epson R300 print setup menu (with compatible paper) and got a perfect borderless greeting card, really professional in appearance. To me, it was well worth the $29. ---One more note; I had to tweak my NVidia 5200 video card settings in Windows XP to get any graphics to show up. How did I know how to do this?, Broderbunds EXCELLENT web based technical support, unbelievable! However, this is a compatibility issue so that's why it only gets 4 of 5 stars. Now to play with the other features this program has to offer!"

3,Print Shop 21 OK,I hadn't used Print Shop since #10 and it was time to upgrade. It does what it promises. It's added a load of icons and various options. I was drawn to the slide show with option to attach a music file. After several efforts the results have been less than stellar.I'm happy with the program but not bowled over.
2,disappointed,Product not new as promised and when I wrote them I was given the run around. No apology. But it did come on time and it works. Not an easy company to deal with.
2,Prefer Print Shop 6,"I started out with Print Shop 6 long ago. Since then, I have purchased 12 and 15. I prefer to use 6. As far as I am concerned. it was the best. I thought of buying 21, but since reading the reviews, I will save my money and stay with Print Shop 6."
3,print shop deluxe,not as intuitive as I would like. Somethings are difficult to alter and must read help files to fix. Otherwise great graphics and lots to choose from.
2,Printshop,"Too hard to manuever through and never could get it to make the cards I needed, after buying the card stock. A waste of money and time."
4,print shop 21 deluxe review,"The program worked very well for the specific project for which I purchased it. Learning how to use the program for other projects is mostly trial and error, however, since the manual seems quite unhelpful."
1,MANY BUGS NO SUPPORT,"I have owned and used all printshop versions. This is the worst out of the box. I purchased version 21 for epson r300 printing and this is the only thing that works. When I tried to merge addresses with a card project, the program crashed. The solution in the knowledge base did not work. After 2 request over 2 weeks, I received an email that informed me that they did not at this time have a solution. The work around was to print labels without pictures. The sole purpose of this program is to print labels with pictures. I finally reinstalled 20 to be able to print lables with picture with addresses. There were several other problems and again the solution in the knowledge base did not work.This acts like a beta version. It appears to be released too soon. Support is terrible. Wait for a later version of 21 which hopefully fixes these problems."
1,Broderbund Print Shop 21 Deluxe,"This is the worst print program I have ever used. I had 20 and loved it but it was misplaced. The box says all kinds of things on 21 that are impossible because you have to down load the images, most of them, from the internet and gee, guess what! They are impossible to download! I am totally dissapointed and angry. Also you cannot get help from Broderbund. There is no such thing as customer service there!"
1,Simply Awful,"It's getting harder and harder to find a piece of software that works the way it is supposed to. Broderbund's offering sure isn't it. There is absolutely no reason for a program like this to lock up on a P4 with 3.0ghz and 128mg video and 1gb memory that is less than a year old.And where the hell is Broderbund's tech support??? Moreover, where is Broderbund's website? Where is Broderbund? Are they still in business? Helllllooooooo? Anyone out there?Save your money - don't buy this dog."
2,"Not worth your money, honest!!!","My beef is that a lot of what used to be in the box is now on Broderbund's I-net site. Besides them wanting to know that I have it and how I use it I have to use dialup (slow) to get graphics etc. and it just isn't worth the price. Want to use an acceptable product from them, I recommend PrintShop 15...it ain't perfect but it's way ahead of PS21 Deluxe. I'm going to return this if I can."
1,autodisable.exe ??,"Four CDs are included with no instructions on this ""deluxe"" version. Used the ""Install CD"" first and though it didn't autorun I could get it to install (one driver problem was reported). I was led to believe the other CDs should be deluxe content but one was called ""Program CD"" (?? how is this different from the ""install CD""??) but it did not autorun and all I could find was an executable called ""autodisable.exe"" (kind of a scary name for an install program!). Got that program to start on the ""Program CD"" and the hard drive was working like crazy, but a dialog box never came up. An internet search suggested this file was a virus... The Broderbund site is useless regarding support. Unless you got hooked on this program in an earlier version, stay far, far away. Maybe the later versions are OK...?"
3,BPS 21,"This product is useful for beginners but quite incomplete for advance users. For example, it does not include ""Sayings and Quotes"" like previous versions. When making greeting cards this is a useful tool."
2,Broderbund behind in technology,I was hoping they had finally caught up with other home publishing and print programs but this is still really slow. I think Printmaster is and was better than Printshop.
4,A Must Read!,"Cordaro is a strong new voice in fiction. This story has it all. It's a love story and more, a true relationship odyssey for the ""clubbing"" generation. Chock full of scenes that will titillate you as well as make you cry, Sidelines is worth checking out."
2,Good plot but...,"I liked the storyline of a woman performer inheritance, it was so true of that period in time. But the overuse of the words ""vigor"" and ""granted"" and the overuse/misuse of the words ""doughty"" and ""surrender(ed)"" made the book hard to wade through. It makes me wonder about the depth of the author's vocabulary or if possibly someone else has a hand in the writing whosevocabulary is not very good."
3,Didn't work for me,"I think this product is certainly a good idea, but it didn't fit my shower curtain rod. I have a decorative rod, (from previous owner), and the hooks fit too tightly to move freely. If it wasn't for that I think the hooks would function well. Unfortunately, I had to return them."
1,doesnt work,When i first got the machine it was very hard to use. I dont know if it was just because mine was broken or if they are all like this. When i go to program it for the first time i had to hold down each button for like 5 seconds for anything to happen. Also i read online that the algorithm in the scale is bad because it wont show minor weight changes unless you put a drastically differnt weight on the scale before you get back on. But anyways after the first hour of trying to use it the machine managed to break becasue it kept saying low battery and wouldn't operate even though I had tried to put new ones in.
2,Not sure how it calculates body water %...,"but apparantly that determines your body fat. For some reason, this thing tells me I have an 85% body water percentage (um... ok), and as such, calculates my body fat out to 6.5%... yeah, not really.The weight part is probably close, but it does a pretty bad job of the rest of the calculations, in my opinion. And yes, I did step on it fresh out of the shower, nice wet feet for better conduction."
1,Non-functional,"The unit never worked from the day it arrived. Unfortunately I spent too much time planning on getting new batteries, and then trying them to return it. The display would work just fine, but it would never recognize any weight placed on the actual scale portion."
4,Opening the Scale,This scale has many functions and if you read all of the literature you can figure out how to work it.Main thing to do when unpacking the unit is to make sure to pull out the stip in the 9V battery.
2,its not as good as people say,"The scale is pretty accurate but the body fat analyzer is junk. It reads me at 15% when I know I am about 10. ""Athletic mode"" is just a way for them to sell their product..doesn't make a difference"
4,basic review,the scale works fine. the top part detaches easily . I had to read the instruction mannual to figure out how to work it. Over all it works fine it is nothing more or less then I expected.
1,Still doesn't work,So far it's just a floor clock. Once again no help from the store's customer service.
1,Worst product ever,"My brother bought this item on sale for 18 bucks and he is a health crazy guy. After he bought it, he started to analyze his fat% with this machine everyday sometimes after every meal several times a day. But his fat rate never went down to 20% which is a discouragement to him, cuz he is really trying to lose weight.Anyhow one day, I decided to use it too, and I wetted my feet as he instructed me and calculated my fat, it turns out with all that belly around me, the machine showed only %16 of fat in my body which is UNBELIEVABLE and defintely wrong. Although my other parts of the body are really slim I have a big belly and I really need to lose weight. Yet the machine is telling me only 16%????? I know as a fact that the ideal percentage is 15%, so it seems like I do not have to worry about weiht anymore but the mirrors are saying the opposite.So I am telling you folks, this machine is a screw up, do not buy it and do not trust its numbers."
2,Fat Analyzer did not work,"I tried and tried and couldn't get this gadget to analyze anything. The scale works, the clock works but that's all."
1,Great Little Floor Clock! :(,"I was very excited to receive this scale. However, while it was very easy to set the time and input my height, activity level, etc., it would not let me weigh myself. I tried everything, even called the manufacturer who confirmed that I was doing eveything right, but the device still would not give my weight. I called AMAZON, and while they were very nice, it has been WEEKS since I requested a return label and I still haven't received it. I guess I will be calling them again.PS The clock on this keeps great time!"
2,Weight is not accurate,"If you are interested in *accurate* weight results, this is not the scale for you. I am not sure of the algorithm, but it will report the exact same weight, even when you know that you weigh a different amount. I have been testing it by picking up 5# dumbbells, and reweighing myself. It will report the exact same weight every single time. If someone significantly lighter steps on the scale, then I get back on it, it will then report the true weight. It's like the algo is ""If the weight of the person is within 5% of the previous weight measured, then just report the previous weight to increase the perception of accuracy"". Other than that, it's a great scale."
1,Won't buy Taylor again,"First one was DOA. Returned it. Replacement lasted a little over a year about the same as my last Taylor scale. My daughter has the same scale and it is failing, too, at the same age. Won't buy Taylor again. They obviously have a quality issue."
1,What Gives?,"20 people rated the product 5 stars. 15 people gave it 1 star. (I agree with the 1 star people.)How does that average to a 4.5 star rating? Please explain, Amazon."
2,It's collecting dust.,"I bought it for my husband, but it's just too complicated to use. Not user friendly. I'm not even sure whether I'm weighing myself correctly or not sometimes. The top part with the digital readout comes off so you can hang it on the wall, but if I try to keep it on the main unit, it just keeps falling off. You get what you pay for."
3,Nice,Although the price was very decent on this scale to try & figure out how to use all of the options & advantages this scale offers was a bit overwhelming. I decided for me all I need to know is how much I weigh but if you're looking for something that offers you all of the benefits of detail body fats ect. this would probably work great.
3,Different color,Color of watch face is not dark gray as shown in the photo. It is a very light gray that is more of a light tan color than dark gray. Still a great watch with simple styling but the picture does not match the actual product.
5,Dance Dance Dance,One of those club hits you hear but don't know anything about the artist. But I asked a DJ and was glad I did because this song is GREAT! Track #2 is worth the price of the single alone. 8 minutes of Junior Vasquez's thumping hands up remix is almost not long enough. One of the best dance hits of the past few months by far. Get it Get it Get it Get it! 1
5,You Can`t be safe anywhere.,Claudia gets a regular sitting job for the Nicholls.Their new clients for the baby sitters club.Claudia thinks Mr.Noicholls abuses his children and unfortunaltly she right.If you want to find out the rest you should get this book
5,love si pure,this book is very moving i enjoyed every minute of it i have read babysitters club since 3 rd grade i am 17 now i love this story i know parents sometimes hit there kids but it is NOT okay to abuse that evil son of a bitch better watch out.
5,wow,"I remember being touched by this book because the BSC has never encountered this kind of thing before. Yes, there was the share of imperfect parents, but when Claudia babysits for a pair of boys, she notices oddities in their behavior, such as being too polite and fearful. This book shows you what to look for in some signs of abuse, so it gives kids a lesson in spotting abuse without being graphic like more adult books or movies would be. Overall a really good book, the BSC series is good for teaching its readers about different things."
5,very touching,"this book was amazing.Because""claudia and the terrible truth""is about when claudia is baby-sitting Nate and Joey Nicholls and she found out that Mr.Nicholls has been abusing them.This book touched really my heart and I recommend it to all of you out there!"
2,Not as Shown,When I opened the box the directions are vague and some of the parts were difficult to fit and didn't seem to be secure. The biggest problem for me is the bike clips and straps aren't what is shown in the ad or on the box. They don't seem to be as secure as the ones you can clearly see on the box. Hopefully my bike will be safe.
3,Doesn't hold the weight very well,"When I went looking for a 4-bike rack, I had in mind 2 adult bikes (26in & 24in) and 2 kids bikes (20in). However I was only able to actually get 3 bikes on the rack, the 4th had to go in the back of my CRV. Also, after the first use I noticed that the bars are now uneven....apparently the weight of 2 adult bikes and 1 kids bike is too heavy for it because it bent one of the bars. Kinda makes me a little uneasy actually because I'm wondering how many trips it will actually survive. I don't want to be hauling bikes somewhere and have one of the bars give out. The glideaway feature is the one thing I do like about this rack though because if you forget to put something in the back then you don't have to take the bikes back off. Comes in handy when you're bringing along a cooler. I just wish I felt more confident that it would hold up."
5,mind blowing,"Wow, this album is pretty terrific. The experimental sounds are a treat, as well as Donaghy's lusciously bitter vocals. The subject matter of the songs are varied and very interesting, and the lyrics - though not thoroughly artful - display great promise. Some of the songs are pretty darn odd and challenging to the listener, but this is what art is all about and Donaghy succeeds with brilliance. This album is simply great, and that is precisely why no-one is buying it."
5,Great gift for cowboy lovers,This gift was a huge hit with my grandpa and father in law. How can you go wrong with 100 cowboy movies?!
3,Seems like an OK set,"I bought this because I thought my husband would really enjoy it. Turns out, he doesn't actually like old westerns, just movies, especially westerns, with John Wayne or Clint Eastwood in them - of which this collection only had a few. So, I ended up returning it and now I'm not buying him presents ever again (this was not the first incident!). But if you truly do like the whole range of 50's-style westerns, you should like this collection."
4,Nice product with a few CONS,"PROS:1. Fluke's famous quality, durability and accuracy.2. Fluke finally made the battery replacement easy. The 9 Volt battery compartment is under the stand's flap fastened with only one small screw.CONS:1. The new holster is skimpy - it leaves part of the front panel and the knob exposed and prone to damage, should the meter fall. The old Fluke holsters used to be more bulletproof.2. Made in CHlNA. Fluke stuff used to be made in USA only. Why everything on US market has to be made in CHlNA now? Not good.3. The biggest CON for me is the display's much lower contrast than it used to be in old Fluke meters (like Fluke model 12). The background is really dark and it makes it hard to see the digits. OK, the new meters have backlight but who will use it constantly and waste the battery?I threw the manual booklet away and downloaded it in PDF file from Fluke's support website.Overall: nice product. Recommended."
5,simple,I like the other reviewers have owned many multimeters but have finally settled on fluke. I used fluke equipment in electronics school and now work in industry that demands using equipment in inclement weather. The fluke has held up great and the auto detection of DC and AC has simplified the work when switching between different circuits. I have also used this meter on weekends when working on old cars and it has worked great for troubleshooting and rewiring vintage metal.
5,Sturdy and very reliable,"Fluke is known for its top notch tools. This one is not different. Although it is called ""Electrician's"" the device is perfect for say anyone that has to measure voltage, current, resistivity, frequency (if not too high), and find power wires in walls (in Europe it seems to me that is too sensitive, as it detects wires from quite a distance, but we have 230V here, and that may make the difference). It helps with min/max/avg functions, auto-range, a readable/backlit display, and is well suited up to 600V and 10A, diodes check, continuity, . Is handy and very sturdy (didn't dropped mine yet, but I dropped others ;-) The only similar product I ever held in my hand of this quality was an ABB multimeter. This one I can recommend professionals working in the field. Also R/C folks."
5,NOT an NTSC-region Blu-Ray,"This Blu-Ray set is not region-coded, but it runs at 50i, so it does NOT PLAY in most Blu-Ray players sold in the USA. On my Sony Blu-Ray player, the opening logos play and then it shuts off. After a long backorder I was thrilled to receive this amazing show on Blu-Ray and I can't watch it!This is an incredibly funny show, but Amazon needs to wait until they release it properly at the correct framerate! Or at minimum, label it properly! It should be labeled as a PAL-framerate set!"
5,freekin awesome!!,Every episode is fantastic. I think this is one of the best series EVER to hit the TV airwaves. The one in Mexico is one of my favorites. This will make you pee your pants laughing. Watch them ALL!!
1,not happy,when i received this item it could not be played in the united states it had a block on it my son was not happy for it was one of his xmas gifts now we just have to stare at it in its case really sucks will never order from amazon again!!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU LIVE IN THE US!!!,This can not be played on a regular US blue ray player. It would be nice if amazon advertised this correctly. What a huge wast of money!
5,Pilkington is gut busting hilarious,This is not your momma's travelogue! Karl Pilkington is himself as he travels the 7 wonders of the world and explains his simple view of the world and events going on around him. Very funny stuff.
5,Hysterical,One of the funniest shows I have watched in a long time! Interesting travel sights and perspective on travel that has never been told before :)
5,Seriously funny,"My husband saw one of these shows on a plane and had to turn it off as it was so funny and he was laughing to loudly, when he arrived home we ordered it straight away and have watched the whole dvd already - what a laugh. Highly recommend."
2,Kind of emabaressing,I did not continue with this series as I was saddened by the insulting behavior of the main characters in this documentary. I thought that it did not honor other cultures so much as ridicule them. My only hope is that no one from the host country could understood english.
1,UGH...formatted for UK machines,This DVD would not play on our American DVD machine as it's formatted for machines in the UK. The information on Amazon did not state this so we purchased and opened before we found it didn't work.
1,"if you live in the USA, dont get this",I have seen this show on the Science channel and wanted to watch it all again at my leisure. Was very disappointed when I realized it isn't formatted for blu ray players in the US. That wasn't specified when I bought it.
1,Amazon Makes Error on DVD Region,"Amazon incorrectly stated that this DVD was the appropriate region for me to purchase. I was unable to view it because it is British and I am in the USA. I'm sure it would have been excellent had I been able to watch it. However, the customer service to return it was great, efficitent and easy."
5,From The Science Channel...are you kidding me?,"OK, I''ll give you this, it is an absolutely wonderful, unique presentation, education, and insight into the Seven Wonders of the World, but far from any self-perceived label of ""Science Channel"". Possibly get it for the amazement of our incredible world, but watch it for FUN. Oh, and see if you don't agree changing the the premise to Eight Wonders of this, our world, thereby making Carl the first! He is brilliant."
5,mindblowingly hilarious,"This is so funny! An entertaining look at a trip to China, from the eyes of Karl. His brutally honest comments and reactions to a culture so different from his are funny/sad/irreverent/and entertaining all at once. A gem of a show like this could only be invented by the genius comedy of Ricky Gervais. I enjoyed watching and laughing uncontrollably to this."
5,"No Really, They Work!","Okay, I work in the theater industry. I run a warehouse full of dirty steel pipe and dusty cables. Now I've got small enough hands that I buy children's sizes for winter gloves. So finding the pair of work gloves which will fit me well enough that I don't have to take off one or both to tie a knot or scrawl a note is almost impossible. But I've had arthritis since age 20 and gloves are a must if I want to be able to pick up a pen at age 50. My family knows of my obsession with the subject and three years ago they bought me a pair of these gloves for my birthday.Now first things first. I tried them on and they fit! That alone would have endeared the folks at ironclad to me. But the fact that they kept on fitting and kept on working with me every day for three years is a miracle in my business. I'm now on my second pair and I have no intention of buying anyone else's glove untill these folks stop making em!"
4,A Lovely Book!,"This is a really great book full of unusual designs (and yes, it is in english). You may want to get a little experience if you are a true beginner before tackling most of these projects, as many of them have somewhat complicated bead paths. There is a 3-D (two sided) heart pendant made from swarovski crystals that is just wonderful! With many beautiful necklaces, bracelets and even rings, this book is a great value!"
5,Yet another fine Japanese Beading book,"I wish there were more of these books. It's so hard to find japanese beading books here in the US. *hint hinT Amazon!!*Having been a beader for over 20 years, It's always wonderful to see how different people over the world approach beading. This book is a wonderful example of the uniqueness you will find in Japanese beading books.The basics to know, is that all the patterns assume you are using two needles to pass the two ends of the thread through, and start at the star, end at the moon. If you need written out instructions, these books arn't for you. Once you take the time to figure out the diagrams, it will all ""click"" and you're ready to go.This one has some beautiful crystal balls/pendants, and a nice version of the puffy crystal heart that is so popular. That pattern alone is worth the book."
5,Great Book with Fantastic Tutorials,"This book is great for beginners. It has check-boxes for you to put a check mark in once you've completed a section. I'm an intermediate beader and just picked up this addicting craft and have been pouring through countless magazines and books. I decided to buy this one and believe it or not, I've actually had success just following the printed diagrams on the instructions pages without having to read the instructions.For novice beaders, you will need a little patience, but practice a few sections before investing in more expensive beads first. It also helps to buy the listed size beads and thread for greatest success.I highly recommend this book! Have fun fellow-beaders!"
2,Not what you might expect,The title was changed to make the book more appealing - was originally going to be 'Knowledge Management' or similar.The book is really an attempt to justify corporations spending money on knowledge management. However it does not have much useful or practical information on managing knowledge.He describes the problem pretty well but there is not enough on solutions.
5,Overdue Insights -- a call for Management Action!,"This book is a wake-up call to management to re-assess the value of staff, and to ensure that this value is fully captured. It contains practical advice on how to capture and learn from past experience. Wall Street should be valueing companies on the basis of the companies ability to learn from its past."
2,Just ok for 17 month old,"I have Comcast which allows me to watch about 10 minutes of certain childrens videos for free. My daughter LOVED the free version, she would watch it 5 times in a row and still ask for more. So I ordered the 30 minute version, and she has yet to sit through even half of it. Not sure what the difference is, but I am SOOO glad I did not buy the 5 DVD set!PS Shipping was faster than I expected."
1,The Celestron C65 Mini Mak,Simply put..dont bother. The optics suck. At 90x forget any though of a clear image and its barely functional at 30x. The build of the unit even looks cheezy. Their binoculars put their spotter scopes to shame.. that is how bad it is.
1,"Think twice before you order any item from ""Adorama Cameras"" over Amazon","I ordered this Scope from Amazon , which the seller was Adorama Cameras.After I placed the order , I noticed the customer reviews about the product and wanted to cancel it , but I learned that this order could not be canceled from Amazon and I had to contact with the seller .I sent an e-mail to Adorama Cameras immediately to cancel my order but could not recieve any answer.Next week , after I recieved the scope from the carier and opened the box , I saw that one leg of the tripod was broken.I suggest not to buy any products from Adorama Cameras."
4,Thai Reference Grammar,"For the money it is an excellent reference book. The book has many examples, easy to understand and very useful to the more advance student. If their is a better Thai grammar book, then I've yet to find that book!"
5,Classic therapy book for survivors,"I have used this book many times in therapy with women and men survivors. It's imagery is very helpful and also very useful to clients who are ""too in their heads"". The imagery cuts through the intellectualizing and rationalizing and aids in healing on a fast track. Her other books and tapes are also highly recommended."
5,Cool Korean Culture,"Colorful and more up-to-date looking than similar books. Brief introduction to major aspects of Korean culture. Covers such topics as clothing, language, religion, dance, music, and food. The book also includes a map of Korea and wonderful illustrations. Each page has the Korean word for the topic discussed written in hangul."
5,"A lively, educational and highly recommended presentation","There are very few picturebooks on Korean culture for kids, which alone makes Land Of Morning Calm stand out for ages 7-12; but its other fine features include an organization by 19 topics ranging from holidays and arts to religions and home life, and beautiful visual displays of each by Soma Han. Land Of Morning Calm is a lively, educational and highly recommended presentation."
3,Interesting book about Korean culture,"Not sure this book is suited as a bedtime story book but definitely interesting as an adult to read. Not sure that younger kids will be interested by it, thus only 3 stars."
5,Zodiac of Echoes,"Kaleidescopic in structure and movement, daringly personal yet intensely political, his verse encompasses narrative, satire, meditation, and high-spirited hilarity. One moment, we're stuck in a highway on the way to the history-glutted Mississippi river. The next, questions of exile, identity, and linguistic alienation spiral in a poem set in a jaunty Cairo taxi ride. Line by line we turn from zany wisecracks about globalization to solemn invocations of the moon, from intensely felt lyricism to splintered, televisual, attention-franctured deferrals of feeling. . . These dazzling lyrics and sequences create one of the most compelling portraits we have of a mind, a sensibility, a language emerging from the hybridization of cultures-Jahan Ramazani"
2,Nice Looking But...,"This is a very nice looking cigar cutter, however it tends to not cut the cigars very well... I have crushed 3-4 cigars since I purchased this item and have since moved on to another cigar cutter."
2,Disappointed.,I am very disappointed with this cutter. Looked beautiful on the website so I figured I'd order one. In person it looks amazing. After crushing three cigars I decided to take it apart to sharpen the blade. Once it was sharp enough to split a blade of grass I gave it another attempt. Same result and the cutter went straight in the trash. Buyer beware.
2,"GOOD BARGAIN, BUT...","This is a very rich looking cutter. On first glance, comparable to the $90 Xicar model. Keep in mind, however, that this is a single-blade model. Guillotine cutters typically have two blades...as long as you know that, then it's an OK cutter for the price."
5,Great C# Book,"This is not a learn how to program in C# book. However, once you have at least some experience in programming with C#, this is the next book you should buy. The chapter on interfaces is worth the price all by itself. After reading it, I finally have a good idea of what interfaces are all about and the circumstances under which they should be used. As long as you keep in mind that it is not a beginners book, you will not be disappointed."
5,Visual C# 2005:The Base Class Library,"Francesco Bakena is a well-known author, the book is good.The themes and the examples are clean. The same line as Visual Basic. I recommend.Manoel de Assis - Brazil - [...]Programming Microsoft Visual C# 2005: The Base Class Library (Pro-Developer)"
3,Gloved,These gloves are pretty good but they need to be water proof! Could be a little better on the grip as well. Overall satisfied costumer!
2,not for use in cold conditions,"I bought these for biking to work in cold weather, and now I need to go buy some different gloves because these do not help with that. Uncomfortable inner seams, not very waterproof and do not keep your hands warm. Better than nothing, but not good."
2,not what i expected,"Carpenter who works in the cold. found them not to keep my hands warm, and water penetrates the gloves very easily"
4,Works well in wet environment,"Glove works as marketed. I kinda wish the wrist had a tighter fit, but other than that works great.This is a neoprene type of glove, your hand will get wet when working in a wet environment. That should be expected before purchasing these. They work just like a web suit works keeps a thin layer of water againts your hand that your body temperature warms up.They are fairly tough having used them in a wet environment for about 4 weeks or so now. I am assuming about 6 months of use before i will need to replace them."
2,Poor quality,"I had a pair of these for about a week before the lining pulled out of the fingers. Once the lining has pulled away from the stitching it's next to impossible to put the gloves back on. You basically just jam the fingers holes with the lining since it will no longer straighten out. I ended up removing the lining completely and use them as normal mechanic gloves. As for cold weather gloves they're marginal at best being good to around 20F before your fingers start freezing. Above 40 your hands begin to sweat causing the lining to stick to your fingers which, for me anyway, caused the lining to pull out as I stated above. Don't waste your money."
2,"not gloves for work, not gloves for the cold","These gloves aren't the worst I've ever had, but they're really not up to the rigors of outdoor work in cold climates. Wet snow seeps right through the material. And if it's raining, forget it. Your hands will be wet and numb with cold in minutes. And to top it off, they smell musty and mildewy -- eeew! I'm still looking for a decent pair of outdoor work gloves, so I'd love to hear some suggestions."
2,Don't buy if you work in cold conditions,"I am a carpenter from Upstate New York. I would not recommend these gloves for cold conditions. I have found when the temperatures get really cold they are useless. I had to get a warmer gloves. They are especially cold if they get wet. Your hands are dry but cold. I have found they are good in temperatures above 15 degrees, but for a winter glove you would expect better. They seem to be made alright, but after two days some of the threads have pulled out. We shall see how they hold up. So far after three weeks, they are still holding up with no more problems with the thread. I think this problem comes with the job though."
1,Your Hands Will Freeze,"Whoever came up with the name for these gloves should have their head examined and the manufacturer should receive some sort of admonition about false and deceptive advertising. I live and work at an elevation of 8,000 feet and frequently work ouside in temperatures in the teens and twenties. Simply stated, these gloves do not keep my hands from freezing at temperatures below about 32 degreees. To make matters worse, they easily get soaking wet and then take a long time to dry. I wish that I had spent my money on something else."
1,READ ALL THE COMMENTS BEFORE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!,"THESE GLOVES AREN'T EITHER WATERFROOF OR ZERO PLUS CONDITION,THEY GOT SOAKED QUIK AND THE LINER BROKE OFF REALLY EASY, I ENDED UP RIPPING THE LINER OUT AND USE THEM AS A NORMAL GENERAL DUTY GLOVE.....UNFORTUNATELY THERE ISN'T MANY GLOVES THAT SUIT THOSE CHARACTERISTICS, I'M A BIG IRONCLAD FAN BUT THESE DON'T LIVE TO THEIR EXPECTATION......... TERRIBLE!!"
1,Don't buy these gloves,I bought these gloves because they came highly recommended on a photographers' chat site I frequent. I wore them one night when it was only ~30F out (~20 if you include wind chill) for just a couple of hours and ended up with frostbite. They do not live up to their name. Don't waste your money.
3,good but....,I work in 30 degrees and most of the time my hands remain warm. The only thing is if I stop working my hands will start to get cold. They are NOT GOOD for wet conditions!!! even smi wet conditions along with the cold its not a good sight.... but other than that they hold up to the punishment that i give them every day.
1,Stay away from these,"Warning these gloves do not keep you warm. My hands and fingers go numb while wearing these gloves. Barely holds up in 40 degree weather, below that your fingers are done."
1,Poorly made gloves,Being a journeyman carpenter in the Chicago area and facing extremely cold temperatures in the winter I am always looking for a good fitting glove. This glove falls apart very quickly if worn everyday for one week. Unfortunately there are not a lot of alternative gloves out there for a carpenter to wear in the winter. These gloves wear out fast and do not keep your hands very warm. The only good thing about the gloves is that they allow for a tight grip. I wish someone would develop a real glove for carpenters.
5,"Not just for the unwed, all men need a review.","I bought the book for my husband of 18 years. Sometimes men forget their manners and this was a fun creative way to get the message across to my husband. He has always been well versed on his etiquette but he had forgotten how to use it with me. Even though I am a mother of two boys I still enjoy and want to be treated as the girl he use to date. We read the book together after the kids went to bed. The book has brought some fun back into our life and he has started giving me that special look and smile that just melts my heart. Ladies the book is not just for the unmarried; spice up your love life. This is just the beginning for us I want another eighteen filled with being his ""Special Girl""."
5,One of the best books on picking up women.....by a woman!,"I just bought this book and read it in under 2 hours.I loved it!This books explains so many things without being dull.This is one of the most comprehensive books on meeting women.I love the illustrations too.One of the best books that covers what us guys need to know.I also recommend these books to add to your collection:1)""U.S.S."".By Leil Lowndes.(means:undercover sex signals)2)""How to pick up beautiful women:secrets every man should know"".By John Eagan.You can find more books on ""dating"",how to pick up girls"",etc from this site."
1,Pointless and Stupid,"If you are looking to ""date out of your league"" don't but this book. If you are looking for ""tips"" such as, bathe before you leave the house, don't talk about your x, don't talk on the cell, hold open the door or pull out chair, you know, the basics, then the book is perfect for you."
5,Mandatory reading for young men,"I was 58 when I read this, so it didn't do me much good, what with my having already discovered by trial and error most of what the author has to say; but oh the agony I could have been spared if I'd had a book like this when I was 18. I copy of this book should be given to every boy at his high-school graduation, as he's preparing to enter the brutal world of adult dating.Masini has been critized for not talking about the importance of a man's developing ""content"" and ""depth."" She doesn't, but doing so would be a waste of time. A man either has depth or he doesn't. Give a jerk a lecture on depth and all you'll have is a jerk who knows how to fake being deep."
3,General Dating Primer,"Not sure, however, if the book delivers on its title. There are many helpful hints to increase your odds of dating (grooming, approach, etc.) Nothing specific to dating ""out of your league."" If you want general information about what females find attractive, here is your book."
4,Great sourcebook for a Vikings campaign,"Spice up your campaign with the fury of the Norsemen! This incomparable sourcebook includes details on rune magic, viking adventurer classes, lots of great adventures (including the infamous Kobold Champions...), and much more. All in all, you get: A map folder, 4 (!) more folders of uncut 3-D buildings and creatures, 2 books (96 pages!), and a giant, full-color, 2-sided poster map. Whip out your CD player, and get Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries going... your campaign will never be the same!"
1,100 dollars every 1.5 years to replace the battery,My Mio stopped working after about a year. I contacted the company and was informed the battery life is about 1.5 years. Mio charges 100 dollars to replace the battery and insists upon your shipping the device UPS. Just be aware it works great for a year or so but appears to have an annual cost of 100 + dollars a year in upkeep for battery.
1,Poor,Mio DigiWalker H610 Handheld GPS and MP3 PlayerReceived this GPS from TigerDirect through Amazon. Planned to use it on trip to Nevada and Colorado. Mountain bike trip in desert and concerned we might get lost. This unit's battery failed almost immediately and could not use it on the trail. Had it less than a month when it failed. Difficult to understand how to set trip destination. We should have purchased a TomTom and should not deal with TigerDirect.
2,Mio DigiWalker GPS,its a great product but the thing is its not capable for window vista which is a problem for me to update it...its an old version so need to update because it sometime read wrong direction..
1,for geeks only,"My reason for buying the H610 was to record my exercise walks. The feature is called Track Recording but does not work.PLUSES: excellent map, good ability to acquire the GPS signal, easy to carry, strong batter performance, nice accessories.MINUSES: simply awful user documentation, useless customer support [they know nothing about the unit, just furnish cookbook answers that are worthless], difficult to use -- geeks OK, but ordinary folks will be confused, features in the machine that do not work and are not mentioned in the documentation.SUMMARY: most reviewers of this unit are copying the sales literature but are NOT using the unit and have no idea of its problems."
5,Awesome GPS for its size,"This product is very small but has lots of great features built into it, like games, a digital compass, weather updates and many many more. The screen is very clear and has great video playback with a crisp clear picture!! It also has great sound when listening to mp3s! I would recommend this to anybody and everybody who is looking for an affordable yet compact GPS device!!"
2,They melted.,"These gels melted in the middle of the video I was shooting. Under worse circumstances, they could have started a fire. I was using florescent lights, which put off much less heat than a typical professional set-up, so I don't see how these can be useful in any lighting configuration."
5,more western swing,"I was not familiar with Curley Williams. I am now and really enjoy his style very much. Not as big a sound or as hot as Bob Will's, or on par with Spade Cooley, but singularly good and pleasant."
5,GREAT!!!,"I watched this one no so long ago on Scifi and it was totally a blast.he plot was excelent and the animation too.Although I'd seen many series with the exatly same characters and that really confuse me a lot.This one is one of the best anime that you can find out there,buy it or rent it.question,does the 999 has something to do with the demonic sign 666???"
2,Galaxy Express 999 wasn't too great.,"Galaxy Express 999 (pronouced ""Three-nine"", btw) wasn't the greatest anime title I've seen. The animation was mediocre, and the dubbing wasn't so great. Sometimes the story dragged on for awhile with nothing too important happening, making it a bit boring. It was entertaining, but there are better anime titles out there."
1,very disappointing,"Promo says recorded by ""Big Movie Orchestra"" but it sounds more like a couple of synthesizers. The ""strings"" are OK but anything on brass or wind sounds AWFUL. Some tracks are not even on pitch. Seller would not refund, either - adding insult to injury! Now it's a handsome coaster for my desk!:-)"
3,"Great plot, disappointing characters","While I appreciated the gritty reality and fast paced plot line of this book, I was in some ways disappointed with the characters. Price explores the effects of the events on the Dempsy community very throughly, but the effort at times seemed rushed, as if he was more interested in depicting the scenes than exploring their meaning.Despite Price's effort to show the ""truth-seeking"" aspect of reporter, Jesse Haus, she comes off selfish and unsympathetic. The amount of energy wasted on her character seemed pointless. Lorenzo Council is more interesting, as a cop balancing between a need to do his job and to protect Dempsy, the place he grew up. The Friends of Kent group and their obsession was fascinating. Yet some of the people we want to know better, like Brenda, her family, and the father of her child are all revealed in brief glimpses that interest the reader, but fade away all too quickly."
4,Good read. Not as good as CLOCKERS.,"Freedomland is a page turner and will probably get the praise that CLOCKERS deserved but did not quite get. The novel is essentially about two issues: race relations and parenting. Baby boomers in the New York City area remember the jingle, ""Mommy and Daddy take my hand, take my hand to Freedomland."" The problem then for parents and now is that the route to Freedomland was/is always a problem because of the assorted and sordid traffic. Price's character delineation is something special. The only character that remains blurry at the end is Jesse."
3,Mediocre.,"Disappointing considering his earlier novels (especially BLOODBROTHERS). This is hard work which is unrewarded. Everything about it is merely okay: the plot, the characters, the writing. It is not a very satisfying read. He used to be really funny (BLOODBROTHERS again- read that instead), but this is just an average, standard, mediocre story"
3,"A disappointment after the astonishing ""Clockers""","Price still has the gift of dialogue, but this story limps badly, especially compared to Clockers. Not nearly so taut; frankly, not at all difficult to put down. After his earlier novel, I was really primed for an exciting ride. Regretably, I didn't get one."
4,A very good book (but I didn't like it as much as Mamet did),"At a reading, David Mamet recommended this book as the best he'd read in a long time. My first Price book and I enjoyed it. Price is a masterful writer, creates great characters, and really evokes a sense of place. But it's not a masterpiece. It's too long and needed a bit more discipline. Also, why did he title it Freedomland when the action took place in Freedomtown?"
4,"Compelling characterizations, terrific imagery","It took me two months of on and off reading to finish this book, but I just could not abandon the characters. Once I settled in for a couple of long ""reads"" I finished in two days. It held me to the end. Clockers and Freedomland both took me into the inner city in such a way that I could almost feel the tension. I would recommend Freedomland to anyone interested in a novel set in a very gritty contempory environment."
3,A compelling story that is drawn out at the end.,"Although the dialogue is authentic, the realistic characters are self serving and often unsympathic, even at the expense of other people's pain. A well written novel that slows down tremendously in the last quarter of the book."
2,Disappointing,"This was a disappoiting book, to say the least. The story wandered, the characters acted in ways that made no sense (and thus seemed totally unrealistic). The dialogue was supposed to sound ""authentic"" but to me it came across as an author filling white space. And all the characters had the exact same speach patterns - eg they all said ""I hear you,"" and they all spoke statements as questions. The story line was fine in retrospect, but the length should have been cut at least in half and the writing tightened."
3,Sparkling dialog and characterization; so-so plot,"Clockers drove me ever forward, like an express train, until I finished it at 3 a.m.Freedomland is more like the local; start and stop, chugging along.Richard Price definitely has an uncanny knack for rendering dialog. But once the primary plot conflict was essentially resolved, I didn't care anymore. And it was made all the more disappointing by the fact that I was looking forward to reading Price's new novel since I finished Clockers 3 or 4 years ago.If Thomas Harris' sequel to The Silence of the Lambs is this disappointing, I may never look forward to a book again..."
3,No one wins,"Remember Susan Smith? Charles Stuart? ""A black man did it""? In this true-to-life work, Richard Price tells us how a disturbed white woman's irresponsibility leads to her own child's death and topples her community into near race war. Verging from deadpan to comical, Price renders a 550-page opus about the irrational racial hows and whys of segregated New Jersey, a harrowing urban circus world that includes ""actors"" (crime suspects), ""shooters"" (TV cameramen), ""jackers,"" and ""players."" For me, Price could trim back some of the police prose and go more interior to reach the complexity of his tale. What we get instead are predictable climaxes and fairly flat characters, with little moral judgement or character growth at the end of it all. It's a prosaic, riveting read, gritty and realistic, jumping straight from today's headlines, but providing no moral guidance whatsoever, even the ""heroes"" walking away worse for wear."
3,GOOD WRITING DESTROYED BY OVERLENGTH,"All of Richard Price's books were lean, taut, realistic and fast.This one starts well, but then you realize that you're about to sit through another ""Day In The Life"" story that isn't all that new or different.And why does it take 700 pages to tell this story?Everyone will argue character development and dialogue, fine, there are more economical ways to accomplish this than risking boring the reader to tears and giving him a very predictable ending as opposed to something insightful."
2,"Slow, boring, tedious, predictable...","I think Price was so caught up in his attempt to accurately capture the ""language"" that he lost sight of the story. I can't image anyone finding the middle 200 pages anything but boring."
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this book because Imus highley recommended it on one of his programs. I was not impressed. The writing style is hard to follow, the action slow. He tries to develop the characters, but many scenes seem to have no connection to the characters or the plot. I won't read another book by this author."
3,"Too reminiscent of Clockers, not as exciting.","In which Price's obsession with cops (see Clockers, Sea of Love, Night and the City, etc., ad nauseum) continues. The book is just plain too long with too many passages that DO NOT MOVE THE PLOT ALONG. I can't help but feel that Price in some way is showing off, using a bigger word instead of the immediate one at hand. Nevertheless, the characterizations are usually right on, as is the dialogue. I have read all six of Price's books, and this is not his best; it's his least satisfying except for maybe The Breaks. Clockers covers the same territory much more effectively. Elements of Freedomland are too predictable. But the attempt is noble, and very few other writers would even go into this territory."
2,Didn't Grab Me,"I am not a fan of books of this type, but I read the blurb onthe back and thought, ""Well, what the hey"". I quit after acouple of hundred pages, after it became apparent that the story was going nowhere. The dialogue may be authentic but I found it very distracting. It almost read like a court transcript in places, as though the author was trying WAAAAY too hard to tell us exactly how these inner-city speech patterns go.This book was a snore."
3,Too wordy,"Although this book has an interesting plot and characters that you can truly care about, it could be improved with some editing. Too much information that adds nothing to the story. Although I found myself wanting to read the entire novel through to the end, some chapters put me to sleep."
1,Long and Even Worse - BORING!!,"I bought this book with great interest as the cover blurbs are ""Gripping, Powerful"" etc etc. Should have said ""Long and Dull"" in my opinion. Starts out well, the kid is missing and the mom is in the hospital. From there.... On Page 463 (I checked) I was thinking ""So when is ANYTHING going to happen other than them talking and talking and talking"". I really had to struggle to finish it and am very disappointed."
2,I bought this book because I love Clockers.,"The film, that is. I've not read Price before, and may notagain. The story drags, the characters aren't developed enough, andthe seemingly good premise doesn't take off. Can't recommend."
1,way too long,How I got through this book I don't know. I kept reading hoping for something unexpected to happen but nothing did. I am usually very affected when stories are about children dying but the author did not succeed to bring any emotion out of me. I trade books with a friend but since she is a friend this one will not be heading her way.
1,"Like, don't bother!","If you actually have the mental stamina to persevere to the end of this rambling narrative of the inner city, please do me a favor: Count how many times Mr. Price uses the word ""like"" and/or the phrase ""I hear you."" You'll be amazed!!"
4,Too long but still holds your interest,"'Freedomland' is at times a powerful book of race, murder, and survival. The First half dozen chapters are brilllant in describing the tension, atmosphere, and characters as they make there way towards there eventual destiny. The book begins to bog down in the middle due to the author's tendacy to overwrite. I found myself saying 'Ok..i got it' ..But still near the end, the author finds his voice ( and maybe his editor..hehhehe) and delivers the goods.."
2,BLAH,"THE BAD FEATURES: 1) Too long; 2) Too many rambling descriptions attempting to ""set the scene""; 3) Cliched characters; 4) Predictable; 5) Too slow.THE GOOD FEATURES: 1) Interesting story; 2) Makes me want to keep reading to ""find the truth behind the lies""; 3) Great dialogue - Price has the lingo down pat; 4) I loved Lorenzo's character.OVERALL: Wait for the paperback version or buy it on audio. ""Clockers"" fans beware: It's not as good."
2,Slow and agonizing,"Let me start by saying the book is well written. The dialogue is outstanding. You get a sense of what each character is feeling with the dialogue that is presented. The only problem is that the story never....NEVER.....develops. It is dialogue only. There are so many ""side"" stories and conversations that you are often subjected to 10-20 pages of ""reliving the past"". It is novel at first but by the midpoint in the book, I wanted to jab my eyes out.The story is centered on a ""missing"" boy and the hunt for that child by a detective and a journalist. Their daily experiences are described in way too much detail and it quickly wears on the reader.This book would have been outstanding had it been about 300 pages shorter."
2,Nothing happens,"Freedomland is as about as entertaining as an Oliver Stone film chronicling the history of synchronized swimming. The dialogue, character development and descriptions are outstanding, but it lacks one crucial element...a story. What little story there is is shallow, predictable, frustratingly slow and flat out boring. It's a 700 page yawn that could have been whittled down to 250 and would still lack the creative substance that one would expect from Richard Price."
1,buyer beware,This is one of the most boring books I have started in a long time. I am about to put it aside but I feel so ripped off that I had to write this review. I would like to be able to get my money back from the author like any other unsatisfactory retail product. I cannot even find an email address for him.
1,don't waste your time and money,"This book was boring I really didn't enjoy it much. When I saw the cover and read the into it looked like a good book, but once I read it I thought it was worthless. I don't think that I would recommend this to any one. All this book was about was that the girl that was one of the main characters cried all the way through the book complaining about her child being kidnapped. I mean I understand she is sad and devastated but not through half of the book,and maybe even more. Well I just thought this was not a good book."
5,50 Secrets of the World's Longest Living People,"You'll revise your diet and thinking after reading this book, a treasure trove of examples for living an innovative health-oriented life. Avoid meats, sugar, salt, fat, and slothfulness. Exercise is key. And, nowhere is the incogitant phrase ""eat healthy"" used (one eats healthfully or eats healthful foods). Have recommended this book to many."
5,Excellent Book on health and longevity.,"This book is excellent. It's basic and straightforward. It has easy-to-follow ideas on how to improve your health in all areas (mind/body/spirituality). It's the same concept as John Robbins' ""Healthy at 100,"" but this is a bit more fun to read and more user-friendly. It's a great book to keep around for many years."
4,LEARN TO EAT BETTER,THIS IS AN AMZING BOOK FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN OUR EIGHTIES AND WANT OT LEARN WHAT IS HEALTHJY TO EAT. IT WOULD HJAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE READ IT FIFTY YEARS AGO SO I WOULDN'T HAV EATEN ALL TERRIBLE JUNK I PUT IN MY BODY BEFORE LEARNING TO EAT HEALTHY. WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THE FRANKENFOODS THAT ARE PRODUCED NOW BY HUGE COMPANIES BENT ON PROFIT BEFORE CUSTOMER CARE. IT EASY TO SEE WHY SOME CULTURES LIVE INTO THEIR NINETIES AND HUNDREDS BY THEIR GEOGRAPHY THAT KEEPS THEM AWAY FROM PACKAGED JUNK FOODS.
5,You won't need drs after reading this book,"If people would take the advice of this book, then we would be a much healthier and less FAT nation of sickly people.If you would eat as this book recommends or as the centenarians described in this book do, you would not have to go on a diet or take pills or even see your dr, you would naturally loose weight and feel great.The book starts with a description of 5 countries with the longest living people:Okinawa,Symi,Campodimele,Hunza and Bama.Then the author has done the homework for you. The 50 secrets are a combination of these peoples nutrition and lifestyle.The book ends with a summary, substances to avoid, and tips along with some recipes from each of the countries described in the book.You won't be disappointed.If you are serious about eating to live, not living to eat then by all means you will enjoy this book.Get one for your dr. too. This book should sit in all the waiting rooms at drs offices!"
4,Great all encompassing book on health,"I found this book very helpful. As a health counselor, I found that it includes almost all the tips I try to teach to my clients. Highly recommend it!"
2,Let's get real,"This book sounds so typical. From the reviews, some of the advice sounds wrong too. It will be harder & harder to follow anyway, when you realize our access to organic food is dwindling, with genetically-engineered crops contaminating conventional or organic crops. When you realize, food producers can use water with chemicals & pharmaceuticals in it, use sewage sludge for fertilizer called 'biomass' and still call the food 'organic'. Not to mention our soil is being stripped of nutrients. Most of the food you buy in stores is irradiated. The more you find out the truth, the more you realize we aren't doing enough to stop the corruption in our food production. Monsanto & friends' goal of owning & patenting all seeds. Let's talk about the real issues with food & health - control of our food supply.I recommend the book Real Food by Nina Planck, and I make no money from recommending it. It opened my eyes."
1,BUY THE COMPUTER VERSION! THIS VERSION [STINKS]!,"I bought this POS when I didn't have a computer. I took it home and played it, the more I played it, the more I notice things were missing(the music in the nudey bar, the secret places etc.)IT JUST [STINKS]! SEGA [STINKS], THEY ALWAYS CUT CORNERS! Why can't i give this 0 stars!"
5,Es un Super Juego,"Yo tuve la oportunidad de jugar este juego en Guatemala y me quedé encantado, por eso he estado buscandolo para comprarlo pero no he tenido suerte. En Internet lo encontré pero no lo enviaban a Guatemala. Asi que hoy nuevamente estoy tratando de comprarlo a traves de un Mail Box con representación en Guatemala."
1,Misses the mark.,"I too suffer from what Max coins the 'superman complex', but I knew that before I read the book. I guess if you're looking for real and useful help to get beyond feeling like you must be perfect and do it all alone, etc. - this book isn't the answer.I agree with some of the other reviews - not very interesting, not very original, and somehow not very genuine. I'm left with the sense the author wrote the book before he figured out a cure for his 'superman complex'."
1,Hard to finish and less than inspiring.,"On the surface the book has appeal, but unfortunately it simply presents many basic principles we have all gathered over the years - admit your fallible, ask for help, etc. and doesn't really help us 'get better' where we may need help. In addition, the story of this former football star? war hero? an all-around great guy? smacks of egomania."
1,Nothing original and not very interesting.,"If you've read any self help/psychology books, don't spend your money here. The message is pretty basic and you've heard it before - balance your life and admit you're not perfect and you can't do it all alone. Not a page turner."
2,advertisement for ones self,"perhaps confessions of grandure would make a better title? the title is misleading, and should actually be called THE CLARK KENT COMPLEX. supermen CREATE INNOVATE and REJUVINATE FOR SOCIETIES BETTERMENT. MAX STANDS FAR A FIELD FROM FLEMMING,MOTZART,PASTURE AND I AM AFRAID FAR FAR A FIELD FROM WATSON, FORD,CARNEGIE AND countless other innovaters,leaders and achievers..... the book is trite simplistic and frankly sophmoronic. the lesson to be learned is this,15 minutes of fame in this instance would be an injustice to both time and money... this book has been written by countless others before, and i sadly suspect will be written again..........."
5,Amazing book and easy to read and understand content,"It's amazing, how easy was to read this book. It's one of the best print guides I have seen in years."
2,Conflicted,"The Good:The book contains an abundance of illustrations which can be very helpful. The author uses the text of the book itself as bad examples of design.The Bad:As a newbie to publication design, I approached this book as a student. I probably would have never even opened the cover of it if it weren't required for a class. The design of the cover (and most of the book) is horrible. I can't read the title and it does nothing to attract me visually. The illustrations are so sloppy they are unprofessional. Although sketches in real life should be messy, the sketches in the book should at least be interpretable. The author never uses any concrete terminology, so it is difficult categorize information as you absorb it."
2,Weak,"I'm not sure that I learned anything from this book. How could I when the author hardly ever makes a point? This was used in my ""Introduction to Philosophy"" course. At first I read all the chapters required, but by the end of the course I realized it was wasting my time and I learned more accurate information by listening to the lectures and reading facts on Wikipedia."
2,can you define that for me.,This book is a pain. The author can't get to the point of what he is talking about. He gives points of view of deferent people but never gives enough so you can get what he is talking about. I find it hard to understand the subject because of the lack of clear definitions. As a student I find this book hot for the resale. The worst part is I love the class I just can't stand the book.Just my two cents.
5,Buy it - BUT NOT FROM PETSMART,"This is a great product; I have used it for the last 3 years. But how can I spend $30 and pay $25 for shipping? I realize this is to Hawaii, but give me a break: NOBODY charges that much. It's too bad Amazon can't arrange for ""partners"" that use their shipping rates!"
2,Quality and strength of this product is disappearing.,"I've been using this product for over twenty years. I notice within the past couple of years, the product has become inferior. The bag separates from the metal handles, rendering it useless after a relatively short term. I will not order this product again."
2,Only good for small dogs...,"I'm not certain this product works well for larger dogs. I have a Great Dane mix, and it seemed if he took one of his ""smaller"" poops I could easily scoop it up using this product, but I was never able to get all of his larger poops into the bag, resulting in a lot of dirty looks from people around the city as I left pieces on the ground behind me. Product also seemed to fall apart if you took more than one go at picking up the poop. It also seemed like an awful lot of waste every time your dog relieves himself-- cardboard, wire, AND plastic? I'll stick to newspaper bags, I think."
3,Kindle version is not put together well,"Great book, I love it and read once a year. However, I was excited when I saw it in kindle version, but once I got it it looks like a kid put it together."
1,"Snake oil salesman, dangerous cult leader","This book is the happy-go-lucky entry guide for his dangerous evangelical cult. You read about promises, the voice of God, and living on faith to do good will. What he needs to write about is how he has justified traveling the world for 40 years on ""donated"" money, acquiring millions in real-estate, (including his own residence in Hawaii)without paying taxes. It's just another fluff piece with hollow promises, containing zero substance."
5,A classic mindblower,"I you had to read only 1 YWAM book, I would highly recommend this. It just shook my mind, made me rethink many things. I read it in just a few days"
3,not for everyone,"I'm just going to say it,this book is poorly written.In fact I know elementary school students who could write a book better than this. How ever the book's content is quite useful if one is planning on attending a YWAM school/outreach. ""Is that really You, God?"" is about how youth with a mission got started and how it has grown in the last fifty years. So if you want to know more about YWAM's foundation and can look over chapters and chapters of grammatical errors then give it a read."
1,This sounds like a com.,"The Playstation Portable (or PSP) was not released until around late 2004. Since the Playstation One was still in development at this time (December 15, 1993) of the supposed release date, I highly doubt this a real UMD. And, if it is, it's most likely homebrew. If your PSP isn't set up to run homebrew games, it will not run this."
4,A practical orientation about Distance Training,"The book deserves the merit of showing diverse Instructional Theories frameworks applied to both Academic and Corporate environments. It becomes even more comprehensive at the point the case studies are shown, so it is easy to evaluate the applicability of all methodologies presented to a certain purpose."
3,Straight from the horse's mouth,"These candid interviews provide some insight into the design decisions and thoughts of the various architects, concerning their respective buildings. The discussions range from 'down to earth' (Goldberg and Lapidus), to flowery and cryptic (Johnson and Kahn). Some amusing anecdotes and bits of info serve to dispel any mystique surrounding these personalities."
2,megazord a mega dissappointment,"This toy is very overpriced at $40. The automobile components hook together into a large robot dude, HOWEVER the parts that hook it all together are not high quality and the parts frequently fall off. Bummer dude. Don't waste your money."
4,Dresdens rock!,"These guys are great. They're like a cross between the Replacements, Husker Du and The Ramones (at least I think so anyway). The album boasts a nice, raw, unpolished sound and is full of songs with great hooks. Especially 'Design and Debris' which is as catchy as the measles."
3,"second part, more of the first","This is necessary reading if you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms simply because this is the actual explanation of what happens to cause the Time of Troubles. The execution of that explanation, though, isn't all that great. It actually seems that there is TOO much time spent on ""developing"" the characters...even after we already know them pretty intimately. The plot seemed to drag (it was fairly fast paced, but in numerous bursts), and it felt like there were parts that were stuffed in there to make the thing take longer. Also, I found the characters frustrating...let's just say that you should only let a guy stab you in the back once, twice in a book, before you see it coming. Read it if you are a fan of the Forgotten Realms, otherwise don't bother."
3,"hmmm, this book needs the opinion of one who is better read","All i can say to the two previous entries is, I'm sorry. I'm sorry your reading of fantasy novels is so empovrished. As i said with Shadowdale, read the books, but dont expect too much. If you thought this was good then Jordan, Roberson, Modesit, Moorcock, and really everyone else out there will blow your mind."
2,Man....,"This book totally failed to impress me. It's the first book I've ever read that really strikes me as bad. Not that Shadowdale was a stellar book, but this....It feels like the author suddenly realized he had to make Cyric evil (MUAHAHAHAHA style...) and just changed his personality instantly from one book to the next. And like someone else said, he's now totally one dimensional. In fact, the plot in general seems forced and predicatable.All in all, the book didn't draw me in.I doubt you'll feel any different."
3,An okay Realms books ever.,This story is very interesting. I think it has some of the best charecters i've ever read. Its cool that they put the gods into the story. Without the gods the story would be pretty boring. The main person in this story is Midnight a female mage who is Mystras chosen. She doesn't really do much in this story. They should of made Adon the main charecter because not many storys have a cool cleric in them.
4,great puzzle for 1-3 year olds,"My daughter just turned two and she loves puzzles. This puzzle is one of her favorite ones. Very thick cardboard puzzle. When I ordered it I thought it was going to be wood, but it is still very durable. She likes it a lot. Good eduacational value."
4,Good Info,Creating a resume for the IT industry is different from other industries. This book starts with that premise and provides good solid information. Worth the price.
4,Powerful Package,"Powerful Package. To find the jobs too - I recommendInformation Technology Jobs in America: Corporate & Government Career GuideITJA explains the industry as marketplace. It shows you salary charts for the IT jobs in U.S. Federal, States and Cities, and pension estimates, and how precisely to go government IT AND the specialized IT service sector companies to go to. Put the resources together and you have a powerful package."
4,Jeremy the dragon hatcher,"I thought this was a good book. It was very interesting and also had good description.Jeremy is in art class. He gets a love letter from Mary Lou and she wants to kiss him after school. Then, after school, he is chased by Mary Lou and two other boys. He runs so far that he finds a magic shop that he has never seen before. In the shop, he buys a dragon's egg. The instructions that Mr. Elives gave him to hatch the egg changed after egg hatched to say how to take care of the egg. This book is descriptive. When he is looking at the dragon and saying how it looks. You can get a picture in your mind of what it looks like.If you like dragons and magic then you might like this book."
4,"Every kid's dream is to have a dragon, right?","In this book, the magic shop reveals a special surprise for an unsuspecting recipient of a pet dragon. Beginning as a curiuos nuisance this dragon soon proves his worth and teaches Jeremy a lesson he will never forget."
4,5th grade student,"it is about a boy named jeremy he is in 6th grade.He gonshatches a dragons egg.he gets chased by a girl named mary lou.she wants to kiss jeremy.Jeremys friend names are Freddy,speciaman.He names his dragon Tiamat.Then tiamat grows,grows,grows,and grows.Then jeremy puts him in a barn."
4,5th Grade readers,"I read the book Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher.It is about this boy that is a sixth grader.He is really short.He was running away Mary Lou because she was trying to kiss Jeremy.Then he ran into a magic shop.He buys a dragon egg for a quarter.Then he leaves trough a back door that will make him get home faster.Then when he got home his dog was jumping in front of him.He went upstairs. Inside the box he found a note that told him how to hatch the dragon egg.But he didn't Knew how to take care of the egg.My favorite part was when Mary Lou was trying to kiss Jeremy.That was my favorite part."
4,Justin,"I enjoyed reading the story Jeremy Thatcher Dragon Hatcher written by Bruce Coville. I enjoyed reading it because it showed his friendship with his pet dragon and haw he took care of it, fed it, and guarded it .The story really catches your attention and makes you wont to keep on reading.The author was rely able to hold on to my attention with the dragon .the dragon grew to extreme lengths rapidly fast. When Jeremy's mom caped on popping into his room and she couldn't see the dragon but Jeremy didn't know he was the only person he knew of that could see the dragon.My favorite sentience in the book was a poem ""Full moons light to wake the egg, full moons light to hatch it, mid summer night will break the world, but St Johns day will patch it.""The story Jeremy Thatcher Dragon Hatcher by Bruce Coville is the most not boring book I have read. I was able to relate to is that you think you have a true friend but don't."
3,5th grade reader,I read the book Jeremy Thatcher Dragon Hatcher.It is about a kid named Jeremy ho buys dragon.He is in sixth grade.And a girl Mary lou wants to kiss him.The dragon egg costed twenty five sents and Jeremy things that guy is crazy so he bought the egg it hathched and he was trig to give him food to see what he eats.And I really liked this book.
5,"""AFUNNY, ENJOYABLE BOOK.""","Jeremy got lost in a city he has never seen or been to.He saw a magic shop and he went inside it, he saw a beautiful ball.the store owner said he will give it to him for a quarter.Jeremy was surprised,he thought it will be very expensive.When he tooked ithome the store owner gave some stange instructions.the paper said it was an egg.when he hatched it only him and another girl could see the dragon.After all its the BEST book I've read."
5,a VERY good book,I've read this book 20 times and i still love it! Tiamat is the best! I think a sequel would be great! You have to read this book!
1,Jeremy thacther Dragon Hacther 5th grade student.,I READ THE BOOK JEREMY THACTHER DRAGON HACTHER.IT IS ABOUT A BOY THAT ENDS UP AT A MAGIC SHOP. AND BUYS A DRAGON EGG.ALSO HE ENDS UP TAKEING THE DRAGON HOME.BUT DOES NOT NO HOW TO HACTH IT.BUT THEN HE FINDS THE INSTUCTIONS.IF YOU ARE THINKING IN YOUR MIND DID SHE LIKE THE BOOK. WHY YES I DID.I LIKED THIS BOOK VERY VERY MUCH.I LIKED THE PART HOW JERMY AND THE DRAGON CONNTEID.THAT WAS THE BEST PART.YOU SHOULD READ IT SOME TIME.
1,5 grad readers rule,Iread the book Jeremyn Thacher Dragon Hatcher.It's about a boy named Jeremy.He went to school found out thet this girl liked him hid in a magic shop bought a dragon egg raised it and had to let it go.And talk to each other by mind
2,Jubilee wine glasses,For the price of the wine glasses I expected a higher quality plastic. I thought they were a little flimsy.
1,healing meditation,The music is louder than the talking on this CD so I cannot hear the speaker. A guided meditation does no good if you can't hear the guiding voice.
5,Peaceful,"Healing Meditation: Nourish Mind, Body and Spirit (Brain Sync Series)This series of meditation does give you nourishment, just as the title says. Kelly Howell's voice is very calming and renewing. I enjoy the Brain Sync Series with Kelly. I would reccomend to everyone wanting a refreshed mind and spirit."
3,Healing/Meditation,"I consider this healing/meditation tape to be of value. It met my expectations but did not exceed them. Overall, I could recommend this tape to a friend."
5,Baileme!,"I discovered Fito Olivares and his band years ago after hearing one of their songs played at an open-air bar on the sandy beach of Puerto Penasco, Mexico. I'm not a novice to Latin music, so I can say with confidence that they play the absolute best cumbia in the world! Excellent musicianship and creativity, etc. etc. When I put them on the juke, my stiff old Anglo hiney finally starts moving the way it should. This music will cheer you up, and this is a superb compilation: BUY IT!"
4,Engaging Book: Need a little help getting started,"Our kids love solving mystery games. They seem to be having a lot of fun with this book, but getting them started was a little slow: there is a clue-tracker sheet that one must create before moving on with the book and, for some reason, our girls (9 and 12) seemed a little put off by this task. But, now they have done that and seem very engrossed in the art scandal.My only recommendation is to 1. Maybe plan to help your kids create this clue-tracker sheet or, 2. The publisher should include it as a tear-out item in the book (which probably adds to production cost)."
4,A Great Art Book; Not Necessarily for Kids,"OK, so this book wasn't at all what I expected. I suppose I thought it would best, filled with silly anecdotes about artists along with a few poorly drawn cartoons and a few easy paragraphs on art history. Not so! This is a book about art and great artists first and foremost. Then, there are a few quirky surprises. The book comes with an attached magnifier, so that you can review the works and the ""fakes"" up close. But this book also has beautifully printed informational pages ""The Museum of Art Catalog,"" that details the works of some of the great masters. You'll find those you know (Botticelli, Degas, Monet, etc.), but also perhaps some lesser known artists (Hooch, Morisot, Uccello). All in all, it's a very fine book about art with an interesting twist. But don't buy it for your child, unless said child is +/- 15, or a budding art protege. Better still, buy it for yourself. If art is your thing, you'll be thrilled."
4,Accurate Reference Monitors,"I am very pleased with the Tapco S-5's so far. They give me a flat response and a very accurate representation of my recordings. I have not had a chance yet to do a lot of final mixdown work with them, but I believe they will do the job very well.These were a gift from my family, and although I love them, they are a bit too accurate. Now I will need to work on my vocals....Regards,Bill Carpenter"
5,Great value for video editing,"I've been using these speakers for the past couple of years for monitoring in a video edit suite. They strike a great balance for near-field monitoring, especially when you know your final mix will be heard in a variety of settings. Probably not for high-end final music mixes, but even then, a great pair of secondary reference monitors. And the price is incredible."
1,A Total Disgrace,"I am from Brooklyn (born and raised my whole life) and am thoroughly disgusted and embarrassed by this sorry excuse for a movie. It was recorded with a cam-corder, the acting is horrible, the women are scary-looking, and the plot is pathetic. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this piece of *%#$."
2,Liona's NOT a composer,"Cliché after tired cliché. This cd shows Liona has a firm grasp of guitar technique and little else. The compositions don't develop so much as meander and there is little that is new or interesting that can bring this disk above pure fluff. Try Dusan Bogdanovic, Roland Dyens, or Andrew York (LAGQ) for a true guitarist/composer example."
5,This book has stunning illustrations.,"I have given this book to a number of my relatives and friends' children, and every one has loved it, most especially for the incredible illustrations. I would highly recommend this, especially for children around 6 years old - but of course, it's never to early to start giving a child books!"
5,Beautiful art,The artwork in this fantastic tale of a boy 'saling' off to a magical island to frolic with lions and sea creatures make the book. My son (3) and I love it.
3,Denmark's emotional ride,"This book was a good read. Denmark had several issues. How he could assume instantly that his ""friends"" where responsible for being so low down was beyond me. Then he just worshipped Sierra too much. She didn't deserve any of the praise he constantly gave her. The turn of events that happen because of his plot to get revenge were terrible. He single-hand ruined his friends lives. I knew from the mention of ""Mr X"" real name that he was the one. The author lost me a couple of times, over detailing things that didn't matter. And I know he said ""purses his/her lips"" at least 3 times and each chapter, which drove me crazy. However this was a good read."
5,What happens when we assume!,"Wow! Talk about twists and turns. This is the kind of book where you get to the good part and you want to throw the book against the wall and say ""I didn't see that coming"" go get a copy and see what I am talking about. This writer is off the chain!"
3,Obsessed avenger !!!!!!!,"This was my first time reading a novel from Freddie Lee Johnson, IIIDenmark Vessey Wheeler scheme of revenge which did not turn out how he expected was the page turner of this book. The story line was good but it seems that the book could have ended with 200 plus page oppose to 352 pages.Again, good storyline but to many unnecessary description of certain sceneries and certain characters. (in other words the description at times did not flow in certain areas of the book)"
3,Nice Read......,"I wasn't as impressed about this book as some of the other readers. I read the book in a couple of days and felt is was an all right read. In my opinion the story could've been wrapped up in about 250 pages. I felt some of Denmark's language to be repetitive and some scenes to be over described. The characters that I did like were Alice and Hilda, they kept the book moving. I also really like the spiritual message throughout the book, it was perfect and not over the top. Overall if you need a book to get you through a long work day or if you have time to kill this would be a good read. I would not recommend this to someone looking for a great book as I could not give it 5 stars."
4,Readers of the Mahogany Soul,"This is a good book. I think anyone can relate to the heartache that Denmark experienced, but he definitely took it to the next level. This book is full of suspense and drama, which gives this book two thumbs up. Check out our review at: www.rmsbookclub.com."
5,Great,Very thin. Great for eggs. Also for chocolate chip cookies. This is one of my new favorite utensils. But don't expect to be flipping big steaks with it.
2,Not Satisfied,This spatula doesn't sit flat enough in the draw. It is bent at too much of an angle and has become one I don't use.
3,"More Romance, Please!","My expectations for this book were at first somewhat low, but upon reading the first few chapters, I had a change of heart. However, the author loses this reader somewhere in the middle of the book.Sheik's Spell started out on a really good note. African American research scientist is rescued by handsome son of an Egyptian sheik. A romance develops despite their cultural differences... Just as the reader gets ready for a nice romantic read, he's given an unnecessary lesson in Egyptian rituals and culture. You find yourself midway of the book, turning the page in hopes the author will get back to said romance, but that doesn't necessarily occur until the last few chapters.This could have been a great romance novel had the author spent less time attempting to educate the reader on the finer aspects of Egypt, and more on the love between the two central characters. I gave it a higher score than it deserved only because it held great potential."
2,Does not auto focus with Nikon 5100,This is avery good lense if you don't mind to manual focus if you Have a Nikon 5100.It will auto focus with the Nikon D7000 which I also have.I find it to be a great disapointment that it doesn't focus with my D5100.I would return it if I didn't have it so long.If I want an auto focus lense for the D5100 I will have to buy a diferent lense.Very unhappy!Sigma - Zoom lens - 18 mm - 125 mm - f/3.8-5.6 D 853109
2,Sigma 18 -125 f3.5-5.6 lens,"I bought this lens to use with my Canon EOS300D. Buyers should beware of the noticeable vignetting - in my opinion this problem is not acceptable in a lens of this price. Sigma should have sorted this out before putting it on the market. On the plus side is the convenient zoom range and the compact size. I guess it depends on whether you consider these benefits outweigh the vignetting problems. Yes, it can be corrected with imaging software, but who wants to have to correct every picture that has an area of sky or other light subject matter in the corners?"
2,Had this tv for about 2 years,I have this tv. Apparently the optical engine on this thing goes at the 2 year point. Sony is very aware of the problem. Lucky for me I spent 340 bucks for an extended warantee. I would suggest you do the same. The optical engine costs $1100 to fix. Depending on your timing of when the thing breaks you could be out a tv for a while since this part gets backordered all the time.I do love the picture on this tv but BUY THE WARANTEE...
3,Still working,I bought this tv in 2004 for the $2800 plus $125 for a 4'hdmi cable. It also had 1 hdmi output . It's crazy how much the technology has come to where we can buy a really nice 3d led with many hdmi and usb outputs for half that price
5,Favorite pens,"They write very nice, and last a good long time, even with me writing a lot in my graduate program. I am a pen freak, so these being my favorite pens is a very good compliment, I have over 500 pens, from mont blanc pens to cross pens to bic pens. These are the best."
4,...So far?,"Have yet to get to the bottom of a pen yet, so there's not much I can say; however, I like how smoothly it writes, and the ink dries quickly. The only drawback as of right now is that it dries a bit lighter than comparable pens, so it may appear gray next to a truer black ink."
1,Not so much!,"This camera was sent to me without a stand. It was also left out of the description that it came without installation disc. Anyway even after downloading the driver off the net it still would not install on my computer. I was going to send it back and the seller said...""Just throw it away."" I thought, ""Oh wow! I was sold something so worthless they do not want it back!"" My money was refunded and the camera was tossed as advised. I never got to see how it would work. I would avoid this one. It is just out of date!Creative Labs WebCam NX Ultra"
3,Wide angle lens may not be for you.,"The image quality and performance of this camera aren't bad, but it has a very wide field of view. This is great if you intend to use it as a baby monitor, security cam, or need to show several people at once, but it's really lousy for 1-on-1 video conferencing or IM. Unless you place it 10 inches from your face you're wasting most of the resolution(and bandwidth) on the background. This arrangement is quite unflattering as it exagerates facial features and reminds me of how people look through the peep hole in your front door - not what you're looking for if trying to attract a mate online."
2,Disappointed it is NOT made in USA,"Nice hat, but really disappointed it is made in China and not in the good old USA. Especially when you pay almost as much as if it was made here in the USA. If I would have known that, I would not have paid as much as I did for this hat. I would have passed on it."
5,A story about a year,Young children have such a hard time understanding the span of a year and the seasons. This book is great because it follows a family through the year. I loved what one of the other reviewers said about it being okay for anxious children. I agree with that. There is one of the stories that I would even say is especially good to share with an anxious child--the one set in winter during a snow storm. My daughters also loved the first story about the dog who came to live with them. This is a wonderful book to read aloud to a kindergartener or first grader!
3,"Good as an introduction, but nothing more","This is a concise introduction to email encryption for people who don't care about prime numbers. It nicely covers all real-life topics users of PGP and GPG are likely to be interested in. Two problems: First, there is a substantial number of typos, as if the book had never been proofread. There is a significant error in chapter 4 -- if you follow the instructions for generating new keys using the command-line (Unix) version of GPG, you will end up with un-usable keys (without subkeys). Accept all default values and you will have no problems. Second, since the book covers several specific versions of PGP and GPG, the user of any specific version will only use 50% of the book at best (and the book is a slim one to start with). As a result, this book should be considered as a basic introduction only, to be read once and never looked at again."
3,PGP & GPG: Email for the Practical Paranoid,I have not yet read the book only the first few pages but I think it is a good book which can make you understand how electronic mail is sent and who can have access to it.Joe Montesin
2,For warm weather only!,"This is NOT a machine for a cool basement. If the temp dips below 60, this machine gets iced over and won't work. In warm weather, it does fine."
3,Nice - but buy the longest extra warranty available,"Purchased the first one from an online vendor and it arrived DOA. Warranty was honored and the second unit arrived about 2 weeks after the first was returned. AWESOME deep bass for movies (especially U571 and the depth charge blasts). Rattled the glasses on our bar.It lasted about 14 months then began to squeak and squawk louder than one can bear to hear. Warranty period was over and estimate was $100 - $150 to try and fix. Gave up and purchased a Sony subwoofer about 6 months later and was good once through its break-in period but it was still not as good as the working JBL sub.Might try again, but would purchase longer tern warranty."
2,R.I.P. To A Great Sounding Sub,"I bought the JBL E250P after hearing it, shopping around to hear what else was available, and then realizing it was a very musical sub that never strained to reach those bottom notes. So I bought it. But like so many others, mine died after 5 years of great service. Same symptoms as so many others. It would flash between off and idle, start to boom for no reason, then the razzes began before it konked out for good. The problems with this sub are well documented. Many claim that leaving it on ""Auto"" rather than turning it on and off when needed, precipitates the problems. I dunno. I'm now stuck between repairing it (a guy on eBay says he can do it for $150 but with only a 30 day warranty) or shopping for a new sub. Right now my system is using a smaller Infinity 10"" as a standby."
5,ANOTHER GREAT WESTCOAST ALBUM,Psycho aka psycho gangsta aka dola mic as he is now known dropped this second solo album in 1997 on his own rat ta tat record label and it is a work of genius every song is a hit on this album start to finish with no filler when i first heard it i was hooked it had great hooks and fantastic backing vocals on its a very rare cd to find now but easily worth the money you wont be sorry trust me
4,"Helped, but didn't totally fix the problem.","Prior to installation, I had a very severe water hammer at one toilet when it was filling. This product certainly dampened out a lot of the severity of the hammering, but didn't get rid of it completely. It's a good product."
2,might work for you?,I'm giving it a 2 because it looks good and is easy to put on.However it did not stop the water hammer when I flush the toilet.I think I have a toilet problem. I had no water hammer noise for 20 + yrs. put in a new toilet and a yr. later the noise started?
3,Complicated,"while I can see the relevance of the extensive introduction, it fails to cross reference, etc. The maps are hard to read in the absence of a zoom feature."
4,"A good ""how"", a somewhat weak ""why"".","If you are looking for a book telling you _how_ the Spanish Civil was faought on both sides - mostly as estatic warfare, on the WWI model, in which a marginal technological advantage was decisive, a military advantage the Francoist side happened to posess - this is _the_ book to purchase. If, on the contrary, you're looking for a History of the Spanish Civil War explaining the ""whys"" of the conflict - the ideological outlook of the contending sides and how it shaped their decisions, specially the decision of the Communist Left to fight a conventional war it would eventually lose - this book suffers from a lack of understanding that will leave the reader to offer an interpretation by her/himself. Nevertheless, a superb piece of military history that is never dull, something which is an outstanding achievement in itself."
4,España: An economic miracle in today's Europe!,"Interested in understanding today's western world? this might be the book to start the quest... A miracle in Europe, no doubt, España didn't turn around its economy by just watching, but by huge ammounts of work and sacrifice. El Generalisimo Francisco Franco might have been the smartest leader in those days in Europe... perhaps he knew how to wait..."
4,Well written-very complicated subject,This is the type of subject that is so complicated I felt like I needed a simpler guide to the Spanish Civil War to help me understand this book. This is not Beevor's fault. It is just a complicated part of history that I was not very familiar with.I found the book to be readable and interesting. Beevor does an excellent job of sorting out the events and putting them in a well organized manner.My one complaint would be the descriptions of the large battles. I found it difficult to get a mental image of the fighting and what was happening. There are quite a few maps but again I did not find them all that helpful.Overall this is a very good one volume hisory of the Spanish Civil War. The reader will need to spend some time digesting the many people and parties involved.
3,Good-but the Bias shows through,"While this is a generally commendable book, and pulls a great amount of information from 1st hand accounts, scrutinized histories, and analysis of new archival information, Beevor lets slip an occasional anti-Traditionalist bias. He seems to accept that digging up corpses and desecrating graves was an acceptable practice, and that much of what the left did was necessary to ""modernize"" devotional Catholics.I am not convinced that devotional religious people are backwards, nor do they need modernizing. Much of the Carlist response to the blasphemies of the left, and eventually Franco's taking up traditional Catholicism seems to be a logical and justified response to a violent assault on religion.Still the book is very good, needs another edit if it goes into another publication, and could use better maps. Completely useful, if one takes note of the slight bias of the author."
3,Beevors least...,"How Franco seized power. As always, Beevor tells a compelling story, but this is his least attractively written book. It will open for many readers a story they are not familiair with.If you want to know the cause of many tensions in Spanish society until now, read this. And please, do have a strong stomach. There is more to war than moving flags on a map and Beevor will show you. Especially in the Spanish Civil War."
2,Not Fair and balanced,I am not an expert in the Spanish Civil War. This was the first book I ever read on it. I want to learn more about it. I understand that abuses in war occur on both sides but I feel the author showed that he disliked the Nationalists and favored the Republic. I was looking for a book that is fair and balanced.Only two chapters appeared to be fair and balanced in the entire book. It appears the war was the result of a conflict between two ideologies ie liberalism verus traditionalism. Traditionalism won the war. I wish more would have been written about the good side of the traditionalist ideology instead of portraying it as evil through most of the book. I guess I will have to keep researching to find out.
2,less complete than Preston,"Compared with ""the spanish civil war"" (revised edition) by Paul Preston : Antony Beevor offers a less complete analysis of the Spanish Civil War. Beevor attaches more importance to the military aspects while Preston gives us a full overview and syntesis of the historical, ideological, economic and social elements that conducted the civil war and the postwar dictatorship.Also Beevor's updated edition is less updated than Preston's latest edition.Frans Smeets, Belgium."
3,Lacking Objectivity,"Antony Beevor has done an excellent job of research and of articulating the results of that research for those wishing to learn about the fascinating Spanish Civil War. Unfortunately, Mr. Beevor's effort has been marred by his manifest bias -- he clearly prefers the Republicans over the Nationalists (though he has few illusions about the Communists), and is distastefully anti-Catholic. A pity, but an effective antidote might be Warren Carroll's ""The Last Crusade."""
5,Lawrence Sanders,"Long time ago I read one of Lawrence Sanders' s detective novels, found it too violent for me and decided never to read this author. Then I accidently bought one of his McNally series and absolutely fall in love with his adorable and mischievous hero and his delightfully elegant style. I bought every single book of these series and loved every one of them! I wish Mr. Sanders were still with us in this ""best of all worlds"" to continue writing mystery novels about Archie McNally. I would never miss any one of them."
4,Approved!,Thrilled to find this book in good condition.It was for a very special friend in Sweden.Thank You!BZ
1,Toy looked raggedy,This monkey looked like it had been on the shelf for a long time. It almost looked used. It was supposed to be a gift. Wasn't real happy with it.
5,I find the album - Its rare as the pope poops.,"the matrix number correspond to the side - In my case Its Lc6669So you want to survive the 3 Billions human deaths that will occur one day or another with this government, you first need to possess the original CD.The sound on the original is very very powerful and crystal clear as long as you have the sound system set on sound surround 5.1 -you are not reading this without having download it first. This is for High class people only. The recently vaccinated people will not like this CD,Their DNA will have been changed. i hope youll find it, It will be priced around the 60$."
5,Packed with Wisdom and Spirit.,"The colorful, beautifully designed cover is a clue to the interior design of this book, which is full of wise counsel, research-backed information, anecdotal inspiration, quotable quotes, and hands-on application for the reader's life and career. Bravo!"
1,Shamrocks and Shenanigans,"Poorly done ripoff. Not truely done by Everlast and not even a decent collection of songs. If you are an Everlast fan, you will hate this CD, as I do."
4,ENTER THE HOUSE OF PAIN,Cool group from back in the day! I wish there was still rap music like this today because it was very groovy and you good dance to it.
4,White boys do what.,I wanted everlast so i picked this album and started wearin my hat flat billed &to the side.
4,House Of Everlast.,"I've wondered for years why ""House Of Pain"" had no collections out, and even though this could be better, it's still ""On Point"". I do wish this included ""Top O' The Morning To Ya"", ""House Of Pain Anthem"", ""Back From The Dead"", and ""Beef Jerky"", from the ""Jerky Boys"" soundtrack. But, it does have the classic ""Jump Around"", ""Same As It Ever Was"", ""Pass The Jinn"", and ""Just Another Victim"", from the ""Judgment Night"" soundtrack. There's even a couple of 1990 pre-HOP tracks on here from ""Everlast"". Although I do like his solo stuff, and hope he keeps recording, I think this could have been an all ""House Of Pain"" collection. Also, chronological order would have been nice to seperate the two eras. Still though, this is 17 tracks of dope beats, and ""Fine Malt Lyrics""."
5,Another good Elisabeth Elliot book.,This woman is so gifted. Her books are a joy and I always learn so much. I love the way she thinks and shares.
3,"FIRST TIME A BUST, second time well done","I ordered two sets of these as a wedding gift. THEY arrived in shards, not even chunks of glass, but glass shards. THE bride and bride's mother were embarassed to tell me, but I am glad they did. I had to send a scathing comment to the supplier, and asked them to use bubble wrap and to pack them appropriatedly. PERHAPS they could also stamp, ""FRAGILE"" onto the package!!! I ordered two replacement sets, which came beautifully as ONE WHOLE candlestick each! THE bride loved them. BY ordering two sets, she could mix and match, or have perfectly paired candlesticks of various heights. Classic look, and the crystal reflected the candle light beautifully."
5,THE PERFECT ACCESSORY,"These are really cool martini picks - and I mean they look cool, a perfect accompaniment for a chilled martini.With a little imagination we've found many other uses for them as well - for hors d'oeuvres, dipping berries in sugar, etc.Their design fits well with a formal table or more casual dining. Handsome and handy, I'd say!"
5,Bottoms Up!,"Just as explained in the title of the product, and perfect for my liquor cabinet. I don't know what more to say other then if you are looking for martini picks then look no more and order these. They look cool with the tiny martinis on the tops and work perfectly fine."
5,Splendid Little Party Highlights,"These perky additions to any already smooth martini are essential to rounding out your classy cocktail party. Superbly chic without being FRU_FRU. Neatly spear your olives or onions on these picks and get your guests gabbing. Make sure you do a head count before your guests leave the party, though, as they are sure to be nabbed as a souvenir of the season's best Cocktail Party!"
3,Not the best,"I like most Dove products but I don't like this one. I have fine blonde hair and this conditioner weighs it down too much. Even if I just use a little and apply it only to the ends of my hair, my hair has no body or volume after styling. Also, it seems to get used up pretty fast. Maybe it is just me, but it seems like I only had the bottle for a month and it is almost gone. And it may just be a coincidence, but the first week after I started using it my forehead broke out and felt more oily than normal. I won't be buying this product again."
1,Smells awful!,"Just got Dove's new ""daily moisture"" formula to try! Unfortunately, the only improvement is in the shape of the bottle. The new fragrance is horrible (like curdled coconut milk with a chaser of astringent lemon floor cleaner), and there is no noticeable difference in the condition of my hair as opposed to the previous formula.So, hope they're ready to say goodbye to their loyal customers who loved the powder fresh scent, like me."
1,NIBO,I had a bad experience with this product. I have ordered 2 of them and none of them worked for a long time.
4,Works great,"I bought two. One for at home and the other in my golf bag. They both work great all the time. Good flame, compact and built well. Can't complain."
1,CRAP LIGHTER,"NIBO - SPACE 6 BUTANE LIGHTER, Workmanship is crap got 1 out of 3 to work! Not worth the money to send it back!"
2,Niblo lighter,Lighter broke after only a few days would not recommend this product. It was cheaper to throw away then to return it. Take my advice and do not buy this product
1,NIBO BUTANE LIGHTER,"IN SHORT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, NO MATTER HOW INEXPENSIVE IT MAY SEEM.IT'S LIFESPAN IS VERY SHORT, NOT DEPENDABLE AT ALL.WORKS GREAT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THEN UTILIZES TOO MUCH BUTANE AND NOT RECOMMENDED.ANTHONY.HBURLINGTON, MA."
5,Gerber plastic pants,"This product is fine, if a bit bulky on the baby. But that's also due to the diaper underneath. It's washable, which is great. They are bigger than i expected--my baby was six weeks old before he was big enough (9 lbs) to wear them."
2,To big,"I ordered a 3t and they were to big... I mean I should have ordered 2sizes smaller. They have not worked for me, at all. Waste of money!"
4,Still Leaked but Overall Good,"My son drinks a lot of water and so wets through his diaper at night. He is 26 months but fits in the weight frame for size 3T. We bought these and although I think they prevent some leakage, we still have a few wet sheets per week. Still an improvement. The elastic leaves marks on his thighs so I don't think a 2T would be appropriate for him. I will continue using these. I rinse them in the sink and have not attempted to wash in the washing machine."
2,Not as leak proof as expected,I was hoping to use these vinyl pants to help potty train my daugther. They were a bit bulky to fit under clothes and when she didn't make to the potty fast enough they didn't keep her clothes from getting wet.
2,gerber doesn't know how to size kids!,"I bought this product small, ordered 18 month size for my daughter who is a small 24 pound 26 month old girl with hardly any butt. These pants are huge. Almost as big as the ones you can find at Target. The leg holes seem about right so I am going to try them anyway even if they can go half way up to her arm pits. The plastic material seems fine, haven't washed them yet. Don't understand why gerber onesies fit just right yet these pants are so huge."
2,Definitely NOT my favorite item,"My 8 month old was waking up in the middle of the night because her diaper had leaked and her pajamas were soaking wet. So, I wanted another option so this wouldn't happen. This product wasn't it. I put these plastic pants on her and she woke up at 2 am anyway because the plastic pants were making her sweat. She was so hot. Plus the elastic around the legs by her thighs were rubbing her skin so much that her thighs were so red. I immediately took the plastic pants off and she immediately fell asleep in my arms. So much for these.I took someone else's opinion and purchased the Huggies Goodnight diapers. They were like a charm. I haven't had one diaper leak in the middle of the night since I started using the Huggies."
2,Gerber Plastic Pants,"I was tired of paying so much for disposable training pants so gave it a try with cloth training pants. They leaked, very bulky and I guess uncomfortable for my daughter because she hated them. They didn't work for us. Went back to disposable."
4,They run big,"I got these to help potty train my son. I'm glad I read the reviews, they do run big. They are helping but are not leak proof. Even if I keep all of the underpants under the rubber pants they still leak."
3,More trouble than it's worth,Unfortunately my daughter had difficulty getting them on and off easily because of the snug elastic. Better for use at nap time when accidents aren't happening frequently. A good back up pant. I prefer the gerber cotton training pants. She can use the potty on her own at preschool with those.
3,just ok,"I ordered these for my 2 year old, to go over his diaper at night because he often 'leaks' through his night time diaper. I put this on him and checked him in the middle of the night and he had already leaked through and had red marks on his legs from the elastic. I was not impressed and ended up throwing them out."
4,great price,this is a great price and i recommend buying them if you are using cloth diapers.there are some draw backs.... i find that they tear easily. at first i washed them in the washing machine with the diapers and most of them came out torn around the edges. so i decided to hand wash them. that seems to be the best way to do it and make them last.it is a bit of work but if you are really willing to do it then it is fine.
5,A lifesaver!,"We were very frustrated because no disposable diaper was making it through the nights with our son. These plastic pants keep the wetness from his disposable diapers in MOST nights so he's sleeping 12 hours a night again. So relieved to have fixed the problem, and happy to have a well-rested baby."
2,For the only ones I could find I guess they will work one day... Details below.,The size is 3 T. Should say 5 T! They are huge and haven't even used them. Two pair even had rips in them. No point in sending back though. Shipping cost are killer.
2,Rash,"This product gives my daughter a rash every time she wears it so we stopped using it. She does NOT have sensitive skin, so this is not a common problem for us."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered theses because I had a few of the older type that had been working. However, these which I have only been using since Thanksgiving are already ripping and tearing. Today, I opened up a 6 months set (I bought from 3 months up to 18 months) and before I even put them on my baby they are already torn. Do not order these. DO NOT waste your money. I hate them. They are not helping me on my cloth diapering needs. However, we will be using them until they completly give out since I bought them."
2,Too big,Not sized properly...buy them one size smaller than you think you need..couldn't tell you how leak proof they are since they were way too big
2,Useful but rip,These are very thin and don't stand up to use. These ripped easily which sucked. But they do do a good job of keeping the mess contained which is their function. My child is 48lbs and these fit much like a bloomer on him
3,Runs Big,Got these for my 3year old daughter. She wares T2 clothing and is about 28lbs. These turned out to be rather large on her.
2,Warning!,"This CD is Copy-Protected in a way that requires you to run an installation that will modify media player on your PC! (!!!) Amazon DOES NOT mention this in it's description of the CD's format, merely calling it enhanced. Amazon's description of 'Enhanced' makes no mention of anything like this copy protection scheme.(Google 'SONY rootkit' to see how bad some copy protection schemes can be...)The CD's shrink-wrap has a sticker that clearly states its copy-protected, but of course you can't see this when buying from Amazon.In order to put these tunes onto an iPod, which is where I listen to all my music, I had to import them one by one using an external CD player hooked in to the Line In jack on my sound card. what a PITA...As for the music, you're probably not interested in this CD if you don't already know them. This is as good a collection as any, some tunes very good, most not so good. Rating - 3 stars for the music, -1 star for the copy protection."
3,"It was still enjoyable, but not as interesting to me...","As always, I enjoyed the Christmas with Southern Living 2000, but found that some of the suggestions for decorating and gifts were more 'seemingly crafty' than in other years! As an interior designer, I enjoy the fine furnishings and decorating tricks, but wasn't as thrilled this time around. Recipes look great though and I'm eager to get busy planning for next season!"
5,Masonic TI ring,"Masonic emblem is etched into the polished finish. Very subtle, very dignified ring. Comfortable to wear, accurate sizing. He is very satisfied."
3,Looks nice but scratches easily,"This is a nice looking, simple ring, very lightweight and understated. Shipping was quick and painless, and the price was very fair. The downside is that the ring does scratch very easily. I've worn this a cumulative 3 or 4 days and it's covered in fine scratches that obscure the S&C. I imagine they can be buffed out, but I don't want to go to the trouble on a regular basis. I do not recommend this ring if you plan on wearing it every day; for that purpose, a tungsten ring is far more durable and scratch resistant."
3,Scratches Very Easily,"I bought this ring in July 2011. The ring is very light and wears nicely. However, it loses it nice shine after just a short time. It has scratches all over it and looks very dull. The emblem is still very noticeable, though. Since owning this one I decided to try something I had success with in the past - a tungsten carbide ring. They cost about 3 times the amount and are twice as heavy but they do not scratch anywhere near as easy. I've had one tungsten carbide ring for over a year with NO scratches to date. The newer masonic tungsten carbide ring I bought is about a week old and hasn't a scratch yet. Much more durable I think."
4,Masonic,I have been told that the ring is very comfortable to wear and he was quite surprised and please to see the Masonic ring in titanium.
3,it's a nice ring,I purchased the wrong size and had to exchange the ring. I expect to have the correct ring somtime soon...I hope.
4,Action packed adventure!!,"This may not be one of the best of the Tarzan films as far as good film making goes, but it is definatley one of the most action packed. Lots of impressivley staged chases with lions and rhinos and a very athletic Boy make for an action packed hour and a half. Gotta love that stock footage of Africa!! Can someone please tell me what kind of bird that 'chicken' looking thing was? Was that a real bird or was it some kind of elaborate puppet? Simply amazing!! I've never seen anything like that in my life!! I find the three movies with Boy to be the most action and fun for repeated viewings and Tarzan and His Mate to be the best overall film. I just wish I could get Tarzan and the Leopard Women and Tarzan's Desert Mystery on VHS."
3,Tongue-in-Cheek Adventure,"""Tarzan's Secret Treasure"" directed by Richard Thorpe injects more humor than menace in this tale of a band of gold seekers who invade Tarzan's jungle domain. The interlopers kidnap Jane and Boy as bait for Tarzan, but instead they all fall captive to the local natives. In usual jungle fashion Tarzan saves the day. This is one of the less memorable Tarzan adventures from MGM."
3,new age style,"this cd is nice , if you like new age native american music( with synthesizers) it's on here. also has flute solo's (my favorites) and chants to..all around good album....lookingbear 2002"
4,color is off,The color appears to be darker in the picture than it actually is. The wine color is more pink than red/maroon. Didn't match as well as I had hoped from looking at the photo. Other than than it is great.
1,Print Shop 21 Pro Photo,This is not worth buying no matter how cheap ($7). I'll spring loose with a few bucks a go with Adobe.
1,print shop pro photo,"I purchased the print shop pro photo, what I got in the box was acdsee 7.0. if you think that what you are getting is a print shop product then do yourself a favor and pass it up.I give this product a zero, definitely not worth buying.The disc itself is labeled print shop pro photo but what you are getting is acdsee 7.0. don't make my mistake."
1,software design doesn't include scaleable interface,"Print shop 21 pro photo has several leaflets on the box explaining the different things you can do with this software. I purposely bought the sofware because it says you can create banners and signs beyond an 8.5 by 11 sheet of paper. In searching the software for a way to rescale my project, I never found a part of the help file able to ""help"" with the problem. The software has been uninstalled and will be exchanged for CAD software that will do the job this one should have been able to do. I guess asking someone who has the program to share the limits of the program first might be more helpful than reading the box...."
3,Track Listing,"Track Listing1. Prelude/Heal the World [7"" edit] 4:312. Prelude/Heal the World [album version] 6:253. She Drives Me Wild 3:414. Man in the Mirror 4:55"
3,amazing!,"Ok so the title (of the review) is kida corny, but dont worry,i did read the book and il have to say its a good book and has a few good ideas, so all in all its a good book."
3,"Great Historical Record, only","This disc sounds as if it is a collection of 78 shellac recordings. Clean up and processing from the original has left the charactersitic frying fish sounds through some of the tracks. In terms of sound, each of the tracks has different background noise. However, as a record of what the Soviet era marches actually sounded like, and were arranged, there are few better sources.This colection preserves some of the recordings of that era (1920s - 1940s). Documentaion is adequate."
5,Delightful Surprise,"With humor and harmony reminiscent of the orginal Limeliters, this album is a delightful surprise. The ""Folk Rap"" is a real knee-slapper. Long time fans will surely want to dust off their guitars and serenade friends with one or more of the lyrical songs. Topical laughs as well as a timeless sense of folk spirit make these original tunes worth many replays"
1,Beware-Not the Original Group,"Fans of the original Limeliters and their recordings should be clearly warned that these are not their old favourites-Lou, Glenn and Alex. This new ""Limeliters"" grouping may share the name, but that little else. This recording and group compares to the original Limeliters as Tang does to fresh orange juice."
5,Cool!,"Kristy's family has a new member: A Labrador retriever puppy named Scout. Kristy is extra excited, since Scout isn't any ordinary puppy, she's being trained to be a guide dog for the blind. The whole family needs to pitch in to help Scout learn to help others. Kristy's a great BSC president and a great Krushers coCH. bUT CAN SHE SUCEED AS A DOG TRAINER?"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I'm an avid BSC fan, but this book just doesn't cut it. The book seems like it goes too fast. At the end of the book, I was looking for the rest of the pages- it left you hanging. The book was a big bore. Spend your moola on other BSC books, no this one. I recommend ""BSC FRIGHT NIGHT."" Check it out."
2,Horrible,"Okay this is my second review that I have written so lets see if it makes it on here. First of all this system was a huge disappointment. The sound quality is awful and it sounds like you are stuck in a can. Second, the graphics are blurry and distorted. Next, the game that came with it is a big disappointment because it does not give you an option on which game to play. I thought there were several choices on the game like many of the other leapster games. For some reason they choose for you and then move you to the next game. I so wish I would have bought the V-smile instead because it the quality of the games and graphics is much better. Over all I am very frustrated that I am stuck with this thing and can't return it. I really hope that the handheld leapster is better because That is what my other child is getting for christmas. Buyer remember just because it says leap frog doesn't mean it is the most wonderful thing out there. V-tech has some great alternitives."
1,Junk,"This game has such poor quality, I can't believe they actually put it on the market. Video games back when I was young, some 30 years ago, had better graphics. It's so bad you can't hardly play the game. My 4 year old can't even tolerate it. At first I thought it was the specific game. Nope. It's that bad with the other 2 we tried as well. Shame on LeapFrog!"
1,Don't BUY,"Awful graphics but my son could get over that if it was easy to control. Hard to manuever or understand what you are supposed to do. The skill sets required don't match the age but rather jump around, at one point asking him to identify large numbers, at the next point simply looking for the correct color. Overall we played with it once and he was bored and confused. He couldn't use it by himself and if he made a mistake or couldn't do something the game didn't advance or correct him it just kept asking the same question. A frustratingly bad product from a usually great company."
1,Not for children with special needs,I purchase this item for my daughter that has Autism. I thought it would be good for her because she is a visual learner. It was too many steps for her to handle. The pen is only good for children that have good fine motor skills. She does not have them yet. I would like to say that I will not return it. I will wait to use it again when her fine motor skills gets better. I have purchase alot of leap frog products for her and they usually work great with her level of maturity but this one is a little too advance for her. Leapfrog you should make a list of products that children on Spectrum can benefit from.
2,Frustrating,"This is a frustrating product. Yes, the graphics are poor, but that would not matter to me if it worked properly. The pen is nearly impossible to control on the pad. The joystick does not obey the direction that it is moved. It is disappointing."
1,Painfully Bad,Seeing this item rise in sales as it decreases in price has driven me to give this a review. Please don't waste your time or money purchasing this item. The system is so dysfunctional it makes it a chore to play a game with your child. It is hard for me to even describe how bad the graphics come out on a large television or any television I have tried it on with my son. The poor graphic quality could be forgiven if not for the absolute disaster that is the controller for this item. Trying to select things on screen with the attached pen is like trying to use chopsticks blindfolded. You will just end up paying for another system to play the Leapster game collection you end up purchasing for this system at $20 a piece. Even at the new insanely low price have enough respect for your kids not to buy this piece of junk
4,Good fun education while they are playing games,"This system is very durable. My children have pulled at it, stepped on it, dropped it, etc. and it still works fine. The graphics aren't the greatest because it is meant originally for a much smaller screen, but it gets to the point of the system to play a game and learn. Games are well done and can use the joystick or the pen. The only problem I have encountered is that games designed for the touchscreen like the draw and write one don't translate entirely well to this. When you could easily trace a letter on the touchscreen my son and I find it difficult to do easily on the joystick touchpad accurately. Other than that everything works fine and would recommend it. Each game has multiple levels which opens up new features and game content when played. The games can be on sale sometimes and are worth it."
3,Leapster TV --- ok for the money,"I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas. I liked the idea that he could use the games he already had and play it on the TV instead of the handheld, which he uses more in the car. The whole system ""feels"" cheap, the joystick felt like it was going to snap off. The pen skips and the graphics aren't great, but for the purpose I bought it for, it works. He wants a real video game system, but I don't want to shell out the money quite yet. So far he is happy with the leapster games. I think for the age range, this is an appropriate learning game. We also have the VSmile system and it is comparable graphics wise, but that console is picky about when it wants to work."
4,Solid Toy - Awesome Price!,"We got this for Christmas. We had some old leapster games from a few years ago. We got it for my 4 year old, but my 11 year old and 8 year old have been playing it too. We also took the power supply from the leapster charger and were able to use it too. This is so great that all the games and components work."
3,Not what I expected,"The product is okay, I really like the big buttons and the large joystick. But there is a tiny screen to write on and manipulate games using the attached pen. It is very difficult to maneuver the pen around the super small screen in order to make the games work. I'm 29 and a skilled PC user, and I had trouble using it - I have no idea how four year olds will make it work. The games were also a disappointment. The picture quality is horrible - very pixelated. I wasn't impressed with the games, but will look for something that doesn't require any use of the pen/screen."
1,I'd rather see how far I can throw it than plug it into the TV.,"This is a very educational piece of crap.Try showing a four year old how to use the mouse pen. Key lesson plan for patience, fine motor control, hand-eye coordination.Look for and fail to find the AC power adapter for this. Provides talking points for rechargeable batteries, renewable energy, and moving away from coal-fired power generation.Game graphics are circa 1985, and games are simple. This springboards into drawing with crayons and likely exceeding the entertainment value, not to mention fidelity of graphics and user involvement. Also provides solid compare/ contrast lessons.Arrives with one controller, so your lesson plan for sharing has better be up to date.Overall, you'll learn a lot, like how this much plastic can travel over 100 feet if you swing it rapidly overhead and get a good tailwind.-C"
3,If it only had better graphics,This game is like a flashback of the good old Atari days. The gameplay is acceptable but the graphics needs some serious help. I was hoping at least Playstation 1 (PS1) quality graphics but this one is really bad. But my kid likes it and thats who this product is targetted for.
4,Lone Wolf's quest for revenge!,"Joe Dever's 'Caverns of Kalte' is the third gamebook in the fantastic, legendary Lone Wolf series. Following the demise of Zagarna, Lone Wolf is set upon a mission to bring Vonotar the Traitor - renegade Magician - to justice. However, Vonotar has found refuge within the icy wastes of Kalte, a hard, merciless wilderness. Where even the ferocities of nature are against him, Lone Wolf must brave the inhabitants of Kalte then steal himself into the magician's fortress. A great sequel to end the legacy of Zagarna, despite it being a part of the Lone Wolf Novice series (books 1-5). In particular, I found the Ice Barbarians a superb feature to this gamebook."
4,Another great hit from Dever!,"The Caverns of Kalte is yet another of the many great Lone Wolf books from Gary Chalk and Joe Dever. This ""episode"" is set in an icy waistland called Kalte. You are sent to track down another of the Darklords minions and bringing him to justice. I have been collecting these books for seven years and I have never gotten tired of reading a single one of them! I suggest you read one too, you will become addicted like me."
5,The Mysteries of Life Explained,"""The Earth Adventure"" discusses the nature, meaning, and purpose of human life from the largest possible perspective. It touches on everything from our ultimate cosmic destiny to the psychology of aging. Along the way it illuminates reincarnation, explains the place of feeling in cognition, and teaches how to understand and work with dreams. In short, it explains what living as a soul in physical reality is all about. Those who are already interested in higher wisdom will be immediately drawn to it. But those who are not as elevated in their interests, being fully absorbed in the everyday drama of ordinary life--those, too, will find much benefit in it as well. Though it talks about higher things in providing a sort of map of life for the rational soul, it does not ask one to ""believe"" anything or to accept anything on faith. Therefore both the fanatic believer and the firm atheist can read it with great benefit. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
5,Honda Service Manaul,This is exactly what a Motorcycle owner needs to know how to repair or maintain a motorcycle. Details the exact procedure of doing many basic things. It is a wonderful tool!
3,Short stories,I am not fond of these books within a book. I only bought it because one of the stories was a conclusion to a series of books. It was OK but I rather resented having to purchase this way to get to read the last book of the series.
2,Disappointing short stories from otherwise much-loved and well-respected authors,"I was rather disappointed by these stories, and that's reflected in how long it took me to plod through this book: almost three weeks, instead of a day or two like usual. It didn't capture me as I had hoped, and I was put off by all the verbal sparring between the characters. What happened to the genteel Southern character? In fact, there wasn't anything particularly Southern about these stories except that they were set in cities in the South - I kept looking for more of the charm that the South is so well-known for. Perhaps my expectations were too high because of my past experience with these wonderful authors. I think the middle story, A Night in Paradise by Heather Graham, was the better story in this otherwise weak collection."
5,All the Classic Moments,"In some ways, this CD surpasses Volumes 1 and (especially) 2 of the music from Lost In Space. All the memorable pieces of music are here, themes repeated again and again throughout the series. It's wonderful to hear the ideas fleshed out and developed completely. John Williams score for ""My Friend, Mr. Nobody"" holds up particularly well on it's own. And the score from ""The Derelict"", while not penned by Williams, contains many signature LIS themes, including the ""Family"" (which I used to call the ""sad"" music). Most LIS fans will agree that a good deal of the magic of the show (especially the first season), was derived from the gorgeous orchestral scores. This CD will not disappoint."
4,don't have to touch it to pick it up,"I always hated the ""picking up poo"" part of walking my dog. YUCK! No longer! These bags are great. You don't have to touch a thing. They are more expensive than a regular plastic grocery bag but who can put a price on not having to wrap your fingers around poo (whether in a plastic bag or not). All you do it scoop, push to close, and throw away!"
5,Great buy for the style and price,"I love these shoes. Steve Madden had a pair that I was eyeing exactly like this but, they are about $50 more. Definately a good buy for the money. The inside has a nice cushion and is very comfy."
5,A fellow neurosurgeon,This book is the best combination of poignancy and accuracy of the life of both a neurosurgeon and a Navy physician.It was really great!
3,Too bad it's fiction.,"It seems unfortunate for the reader that this is a fictionalized account of what must be/have been a very interesting career. I suspect a detailed autobiographical account would have been much more interesting. One has the feeling there is an exciting and pertinent story here, but it never seems to develop very well. Medical research, military service including VietNam, private practice in the midst of a revolution in healthcare certainly generated experiences that would be both exciting and instructive. There are allusions to them, but very little detail. It left this reader feeling the attempt to fictionalize detracted from what would otherwise be a great story."
1,"""Not Complete""","Upon reciept of the album,I looked immediately for the title song ""welcome to my world"". The two discs in the packet were a different color, but the songs were exactly the same, and ""welcome to my world"" was not on either disc. I wrote a note to that effect when returning the order, but apparently no one read my complaint. I would have been pleased for them to send a complete replacement, however they just refunded my money."
5,Fantastic Product! No More Bleeding Gums!!!!,"I have been using this product for about 10 years. My gums were in bad shape, always bleeding when I brushed. My dentist recommended Mentadent. I bought it right away. It took a couple days to get used to the baking soda taste, but after that, I didn't even notice it. The mint flavor was great! Best of all, my gums stopped bleeding and haven't bled during all of the years I have been using Mentadent. It's been hard to find on the store shelves recently, so I was pleased to find it here on Amazon. I love this toothpaste! I'll keep on using it until they don't make it anymore!"
3,Nice and creative,it is a creative product for the toothpaste market i have ever seen. but i need more information about this dual pump toothpaste in US or other countries that sold this product. i want to know that is it this product was successful in the toothpaste product or not. i need to see more picture for this product too. thanks...
1,Doesn't work,I wouldn't waste my money. My husband took it for 3 months and did nothing! Try cialis or some natural testosterone that worked great!
3,Good Performance - Mediocre sound,"The university where I work recently got an online streaming audio service, and this performance is available for this work. The recording boasts an excellent cast and all were in good voice, so I have no problems with the performance. Kraus was especially good. This is apparently an in-house recording of a live performance. The sound is not very good, and I don't think this is attributable to the online sound, which has been excellent for other recordings. The sound is not terrible, but there is a lot of off-mike singing, which is fairly common in live performances. I probably would have given 4 stars if the price were not so high."
3,Quirky release from uber avants before their time,"The Bad Plus really shined on their follow-up These Are the Vistas, which received a modicum of attention and probably deserves more. On this earlier release, originally (and possibly still) on a Spanish label, some of the grooves are mellower than the peaks that Vistas reaches - but, then, maybe that's why they were called vistas. Motel was the place they stayed on the way to the peaks, and will interest you once you've experienced the vistas - but perhaps not if you, like the band, go to Motel first."
4,'Early' Bad Plus,"Clearly an 'early' Bad Plus, but nonetheless a very interesting album.The music is not yet as compact as on the albums they've recorded after this one, but all the Bad Plus ingredients are already in it. If you haven't yet got an album from this trio I would recommend you 'Prog', their latest one."
1,the greek holocaust,"was really interested in the topic as both my parents are pontian and heard my stories BUT was not expecting a hand held recorder of parades in america . was half expecting footage of were my people lived ,some of the infamous places were they were slaughtered ect . this dvd IS THE BIGGEST DUD I HAVE EVVVVER bought DNT reapeat DNT buy it and if the rest of this guys productions(rolling on the floor with laughter) are like this WELLLLL decide 4 urself (this is my first EVER reveiw thought i had 2 do it )"
1,I was duped,"This is not a documentary it is interviews at some damn parade. There was not a lot of information when this product became available and I thought someone had made a film like the armenians have about the history and what happened at that time. I tried to watch this cd, but lost interest very quickly. I have tried to watch it several times, but what the heck don't waste your money. I will never buy a product ever again that does not have more info. I am the child of a survivor and I would have been happier if you had used more info from survivors and some pictures from smyrni and made it more like a documentary. If you see the cover of the cd that is what really fooled me. Well live and learn. In any event may all the lost souls of that tradedy, may thier memory be eternal."
2,History is like a blade with two sides,"Turks were in Anatolia since 1200s and they had the total control of region for almost since 1400s .When Ottoman Empire collapsed it was a good time for Greeks to save their Asia Minor but they failed. It was a war.Not a holocaust.Greeks started loosing the war when France, Italy left occupied territories and became neutral to the Greek-Turco war..NOT when they started selling weapons to Turks.Greeks was being supported by UK and other countries since the beginning of the war.It is sad for a nation being a part of another nation for over 400 years. This is the grounding of hatred for Turks.Islam is not a religion of peace(this is a BS) but Turks were very tolerant (for its time) to the nations they occupied. This was major reason why the Empire lasted over 600 years.Just a simple question, if they were not tolerant, how more than 20 nations could have kept their religion and national values."
2,Valuable but grating,"I will keep this short and simple: Friedwald is a bad writer. This book contains a lot of bad jokes, forced analogies, a juvenile prose style and some occasional mistakes. However, this book is invaluable for someone who knows little about jazz singing, for it contains much information and most, if not all, the really important names in vocal jazz. However, if you are a more experienced listener, you will be put off by his off-handed dismissals of legends like Helen Merrill and talented minor figures like Lee Morse and Julie London, with little or no justification for his dislike of them. But he praises people like Perry Como, Dinah Shore and Doris Day.Hmmmm."
2,An Artistry In Bias!,"Seven pages devoted to Lee Wiley. Cleo Laine in the ""Must To Avoid Department"". And so it goes all through Mr. Friedwald's book, which reflects more the author's moods than historical facts. Mr. Friedwald takes the reader by the hand and decides what to listen to and what to reject. What he wrote about vocal groups is particularly revealing: to assess that the Hi-Lo's are like a solo singer ""singing badly"" is an origi- nal point of view, to say the least. Thus Mr. Friedwald built the whole story upon his likings and his resentments. Well, actually he's got a point: he didn't call it The ""History"" of jazz singing..."
2,Not much substance,I was let down by this book. The title drew me in but the content was a big disappointment.
1,He can't seem to make up his mind,This book drifts back and forth with no solid foundation. It seems as if the author can't make up his mind--which seems to set the book back at times--with the proper editing I believe this book my begin and finish some sort of consolidated theme.
3,"Simple, stylish","I was looking for a watch with a simple, uncluttered display and I found it with this watch. I've looked around and I have to say that this type and style of watch has few similar competitors. Press the button on the side to display month and day or again to get seconds. The watch has a wide elastic watch band which might chafe or pinch wearers with a thick wrist. It also doesn't have a backlight so you can't see the display in the dark. The battery has to be replaced by a jeweler or the manufacturer instead of allowing self-servicing. This may be a concern since I've only had mine for a few months and the battery is already wearing out."
2,"Flashy, but problematic","I've had the watch since 07 and it's not working anymore. It will keep the time for awhile, then the display will fade away and stop working. When you tap the side, it comes back to life and starts where it left off, only it doesn't keep the time in the meantime and you have to reset it almost daily. NOw I don't bother wearing it."
3,Good for the money,"A good collection and worth buying given the price. Although I prefer John Willams' style, Bream is an accomplished performer and provides a good selection of Spanish music. The organization of the CD's, however is not the best and some pieces are repeated. Nevertheless, for someone who wants to have a good selection of Spanish Classical Guitar music this is a good buy."
4,Oscar Levant makes beautiful music,"I remember as a child listening to Oscar Levant. My parents used to buy me the records and I would listen over and over. Oscar was a genius there is no doubt about that. He was also very brilliant and extremely funny. This music brought it all back to me. No matter what age, you are swept into the wonderment of music."
5,Table Weights,"During the summer months, we eat outside with a lot of friends. These table weights are very good at holding the table cloth down before we set the table. Many of our friends have remarked on how well they work if a breeze comes up and how good they look. We have a few different styles."
1,"Only lasted a few years, cannot turn on manually.","Bought as replacement or orignal sensor that failed in a flood light. This one also did not last long. 2-3 yrs. Also it would not turn on manually (when you cycle the light switch of for one sec and back on) as it should have. Looking for another replacement, again."
1,cycles on and off constantly in a light breeze,"I have two sets of Heath Zenith lights. My old sensor's photocell finally died on one set so I replaced it with this one, which is the same model. The old sensor worked fine for 7 years. This one out of the box is oversensitive. Even on the minimum sensitive setting if there is a light breeze, the lights come on. The old sensor did not do this. Nothing else changed, so it's the sensor. I picked up a second one thinking it was just a bad unit. Nope...same problem. We'll likely need to get something a little better quality to work properly. These are made in China and sold in big box stores so I'm not too surprised at the lack of quality. Customer support is useless. Without going into too much detail, let's just say that I think they work for free. I used to recommend Heath Zenith lights. No longer."
2,Not for use with flourescent lights,This sensor will not work with a flourescent light. I didn't see that information in the description although it may be there somewhere. It will work only with an incadescent light bulb. It will not even register with my little AC test lamp that has a neon (presumed) bulb in it to tell whether there is 120v or 220v present. Hope they come out with one (240 range) that will work with flourescent soon.
1,Heathco = Junk,"I bought three different Heathco motion sensing lights and all three had problems. I bought them at three different stores thinking there might have been a bad batch or something... Each was defective in its own way. The ""dim"" mode never come on the first one. The second never turned off, it stayed full bright all night. The third one cycled on and off every ten seconds. I read the instructions, reset by turning off/on, reaimed lights...even emailed Heathco. Guess what? They never responded. POOR QUALITY AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. A losing combination for sure!!!"
1,Defective product,"I agree with a previous poster. This unit cycled on and off every 2 minutes at the lowest sensitivity, in a quiet backyard. I tried everything I know to make it work. I bought this unit to replace a Heath 180 degree sensor that died in the fixture. This 240 degree sensor would not work properly under any conditions. Really, it's just useless junk that needs to be redesigned."
2,umm,"No self respecting del fan would buy this album. I bought it and didn't respect myself afterwards. Not the best sampling of del tracks, even for old school. Not to mention del has likened his time at elektra to being a slave on a plantation...in fact do yourself a favor go cop the album with that track- future development."
2,D-e-l,"I remember around 1991, NBA Inside Stuff did a feature on B.J. Armstrong (my favorite player) of the Chicago Bulls. B.J. said that his favorite song was ""Mr. Dobalina"". I remember thinking, well, if B.J. Armstrong likes this guy named Del tha Funkee Homosapien, then he must be good.And yes, Del's first album ""I Wish My Brother George Was Here"" is an absolute hands-down hip-hop classic. So I recommend that album over this one (it's cheap too). Del was at his creative peak with that first album; it featured great production from Ice Cube (back when Ice Cube made good albums instead of movies).Since then, his career's been a mixed bag. His CD's are very inconsistent. A Best Of CD is probably a good way to get an overview of those mixed-result cd's.But I think you'd also be better off buying ""Deltron 3030"" and ""I Wish My Brother George..."" instead."
4,"Basic, yet current observations","In my opinion, this is a fine book which details basic current planning principles. There are many photos and many references to built projects. Case studies are a strong point of this fine book."
4,"Nice card, v3.8 Software","Great card, great remote, -just okay software. The BeyondTV software version bundled is v3.8 The newest BeyondTV release is 4.x (For a limited time, you can upgrade from this version for an extra $30).I have owned this kit for a couple of weeks and I love the card and the remote. The picture is wonderful and the tuner is strong. However, the BeyondTV software is a little buggy and it seems like they won't even try to fix known problems.I also get a bad feeling about the fact that they delete posts on their support forum which ask about problems they haven't fixed yet (or have no intention of fixing!)The card is good and the RF remote is great, but I'll be buying a different brand of software."
2,Doubts...maybe outdated and incorrect info,"Don't know about now, but just as an example, according to a report in 1998, Espirit made some of its clothes in sweatshops paying as little as $0.13 per hour and horrible working conditions. You call that a socially responsible company?"
2,Just didn't do it for me ...........,"I so wanted to like this book. The plot and storyline seemed to have excellent potential and I found the hero to be ""heroic"", but the leading lady, Olivia, was a simpering, whiny excuse for a female, right from the git-go."
2,Bloodlines a disappointing read,"I was surprised how weak,passive and easily led the heroine was. I found it annoying this grown woman calling her grandfather ""Grampy"" throughout the book. The romance didn't ring true. I think this book could have been a really good romantic suspense novel in different hands. The characters are two dimensional as stated by another reviewer. I had a difficult time even finishing this book. I was ready to fling it across the room but hate to waste the money and kept hoping the ending would be a redeeming feature but it wasn't."
4,excellent,"Roy Budd is a soundtrack composer you may not know. He never gained the fame of a Quincy Jones or Jerry Goldsmith, but that never kept him from writing one hell of a film score. Get Cater came in 1971--this is with Michael Cane, not the remake with Sylvester Stalone,Budd made a type of classical funk for his film work, and for a great sampling of that, check out theGet Budd - O.S.T.double CD compilation. But this soundtrack is also important to hear, mixing Budd's style of instrumentals with early 1970s style R&B.;I respectfully disagree with my fellow reviewer. As a fan of deep funk, I highly appreciate the vintage R&B; work here. Budd should have gone to work for Stax. Listen hard to ""Love Is A Four Letter Word,"" which I had to stop the CD in the middle to play FIVE TIMES.For this and Budd's instrumental work, Get Carter. Get Carter today."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Ignoring all the other bad reviews, I bought this book because it was the only one out there about doing accounting on the Internet. First of all, the content isn't at all what I had expected. Second, the book is full of chapters on stuff that doesn't make any sense. I mean, come on, a chapter on what the Internet is??? Aren't we a little past that? Third, the writing is difficult to follow and what little I did read through just left me confused.I flipped through the whole book searching for SOMETHING useful and maybe found 5 pages total with info I might be able to use. Needless to say, I returned this book. Oh, and the fact that it costs like $33 is ridiculously expensive and absolutely NOT worth it for what you get...I wouldn't pay $2 for it!"
4,Useful Info,"This book is a little outdated, but contains quite a bit of helpful information. It is primarily for large accounting firms, who want to develop an online service. However, I have found very good info for my sole proprietorship. It is primarily about the technical/internet aspects - what to think about, how to ensure your goals are clear, how to get everyone in the business on board, how to develop your own database or accounting software (which most people will not do today), and much more. It even discusses writing a business plan, defining your target market, researching competitors, and such, if you have not done that yet with your business."
5,Love Guster; don't eat them.,"I'm not sure what the guy who called them 'sellouts' was thinking. One of the things I like most about Guster is that they HAVEN'T sold out and they've remained quite down to earth even during their latest bit of success. I don't think that success is equivalent to selling out -- they've still retained the Parachute/Goldfly sound we love them for. One really spiffy thing about Lost and Gone Forever is that they didn't use another drummer -- it's just Brian whacking the bongos. So, yeah. Buy the CD."
3,"Average, won't stay in CD rotation","I first saw and bought Guster when they were playing on a street corner in Harvard Square at the Head of the Charles in 1996. They were amazing and the CD Parachute is still one of the best I own. I played Parachute to anyone who would listen. Since then I've seen Guster numerous times in Boston and they are an even better live band than their CD's would lead you to believe. They remain on my list of ""must see"" live acts. Nevertheless, Goldfly was a disappointing follow up, although still a good CD. LAGF is a step up from Goldfly but I still wouldn't put it up in the five star category. I like the band, the sound and the CD's; Guster just doesn't impress me as they once did. I'm glad the boys from Tufts have had success and I truly hope they expand and sell to a huge audience - I just also hope they recapture some of what made me notice them on the street corner in 1996."
2,eh...,"granted, i haven't heard goldfly, but i live and breath Parachute, so i was psyched for this and ended up dissappointed as hell. what happened to the non-stop lyrics? the interesting, non-goo-goo dolls style lyrics? their melodies and harmonies now are totally predictable, repetitive, boring, and mainstream. this is not what i liked about them, this is some other processed-for-commercialism band. too bad, because songs one and two are really pretty good. loosen up, get back to basics boys, and lay off the electric circus there in the background."
4,great music!,"they have really great music. i had never heard of guster, until just this weekend. they were playing on a pbs show called Austin City Limits. They sounded great."
3,Not as good as expected,"When I heard that Guster supposedly had the same sound as Jump, Little Children, one of my favorite bands, I immediately bought this CD. Although a few of the songs are pretty decent, overall this album was a disappointment. Maybe it was because I had such high expectations with the comparison to J, LC, but I found the album a little flat in places. The drum beats do help to distinguish it from other bands, but it was one of the high points of the album. There are a few catchy tunes, but you'll find that those are the ones that they put out as singles, such as ""Fa Fa"" and ""Barrel of a Gun."""
5,fav cd of all time,"whatever your mood, lost and gone will fit it. diverse and sometimes funny, this is the third album from guster. a must have!"
2,Don't mean to pee on their parade...,"honestly, I just don't get this. This is the first time in many years and several thousands of $$ in purchases where I bought something so highly rated on Amazon and ended-up very disappointed. This is my first intro to Guster, and I bought this album instead of another choice because the reviewers said this is *the* Guster album. Well, I wish I could send it back. The lyrics are decent, the music actually pretty good, but the lead singer has one of the most irritating voices I have ever heard. I'm not saying that because I think I'm better. I'm saying it because you really, really need to listen to a couple of takes before you spend your money. I didn't -- I went soley on the advice of reviews."
2,Good vocalists with one good cover tune...,"I got it because I liked their cover tune, and while they're good vocalists, and overall, pretty good musicians, I didn't care for the rest of their CD."
5,sing-along CD,"After having this CD practically sealed in my CD player since I got it, I can pretty much sing it beginning to end - if you love great pop music in the vein of Jellyfish and Matthew Sweet, I think you'll dig this as well - the melodies, the harmonies, and some great little production gems (theramin, something that sounds like keys jingling recorded backwards, and even a typewriter) make this CD as much a joy to listen to the millionth time as the first. And the fact that Brian plays all the percussion with taped-up fingers instead of sticks blows my mind - you have to see this live."
5,the best music is somtimes found by accident :),"If you are tired of all the same music you hear on the radio all day, then you should give a listen to Guster,they are original in the most perfect way.I love the powerful lyrics and great sound. just give it chance for the love of great music :)"
5,I LOVE IT!!!,"I usually only listen to ""electronica"" for lack of a better word. I mean if you see my music collection it is 90% techno/drumnbass/ambient/fusion/downtempo/breaks/electro blah blah.. you know the drill. My girlfriend is into bands. Mostly three to five guys with guitars and a drummer, etc. I usually look down my nose on that kind of thing (yes I'm a snob) but I LOVE THIS CD!! GUSTER FREAKING ROCKS!!!!!! I saw them in concert with The Bare Naked Ladies (another group I would never have been seen with but for my wonderful girlfriend). So I am opening up a bit, and I think Guster ESPECIALLY the drummer, are UNBELIEVEABLE!! I just love this CD, I play it all the time."
5,Great CD,"Guster is orginally from my home town, so I have been listening to them for some time now. This CD is different the Goldfly and Parachute, but it is a change that is neither better or worse. The music is very good, and mellow over all. This CD can be put in and listened to track by track. It's great. Two of the best band traits that Guster posseses are the amazing percussion on the bongos, and their voices, which compliment themselves very well. Other bands that relate to Guster are Dispatch, Far Too Jones, Jump Little Children, and pergaps there is a hint of Dave Matthews Band or Phish in some songs, but deffinatley no ""jam-sessions"" like DMB likes to do.Get the CD, it's great."
5,Lost and Gone Forever,"This album contains the most moving and heart-felt lyrics and melodies. This, compared to Goldfly, it astonishing. I can listen to it over and over again and I never get tired of it. You can truly listen to it all the way through every time you play it. I recommend this album to anyone that enjoys a mellow but vibrant sound. Don't listen to it if you are depressed though. It will move you to tears!"
5,Great Guster!,"I love the mellow mood this puts me in without putting me to sleep. Catchy lyrics, riffs and MEN WHO CAN SING! Everyone knows the popular ""Barrel of a Gun"" with good percussion and countdown lyric and will like ""Center of Attention"" with its fun, quirky melody, but ""Two Points for Honesty"" and ""Rainy Day"" finish off the alubm like a nice, slow evening after a fun-filled day.Good for people who like to sing along to something other than pop music without sacrificing musical talent and meaningful lyrics. It's a lot like Coldplay but without all the depression and a little more nasal sounding vocals."
4,"Guster, Guster Guster","I'm listening to ""Window"" from the album Parachute as we speak. It is a live version w/ Matthew Bivens on harmonica, and I can't but stop wondering HOW THE HELL ARE THESE GUYS SO GOOD? Lost and Gone Forever only augments to their fantastic albums. While it lacks the upbeat the tempos that turned the band on to me initally, it definately compensates by its rich tapestry of vocal layers and musical depth. This CD is amazing in its range, from the fast ""Barrel Of a Gun"" to the mediocre ""Fa Fa Fa (Never Be The Same Again)"" it keeps me entertained. Of their 3 albums this is easily their worst--while it could be the best for many other bands in this style of music."
5,Obsessed In Wisconsin,"Guster is by far one of the best bands out there. Their sound is unique, soulful, undefinable. When someone asks ""who do they sound like?"" all you can answer is ""Guster"". The drums and guitar riffs are phenomenal! This cd is not leaving my stereo anytime soon. It's one that you can listen to over and over again without getting sick of the songs. Every song is different and gets you going. Guster is going to develop a great following someday. If you like Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, Pat McGee Band...Guster is a combination of all the above but even better. They've won me over and as soon as you hear them (especially in concert...it's their time to shine) you'll be captivated. Guster forever!"
4,Not As Great but Has Some Excellent Melodies,"After reading Dave Matthews ""Step Into the Light"" they mentioned Guster and when I was at a Dashboard Confessional forum someone recommended this guys. I picked up Goldfly first I was amazed to have found a band thats as equally as good as Dave Matthews and as talenlted. I picked up this cd next these cd is decent. It has its flaws, such Center of Attention and All The Way Up To Heaven. But they make up with Either Way, What You Wish For, and the probably the greatest track they ever done was Happier. The song is so beautiful it lifts you up in your most depressing moments of your life. I recommend getting Goldfly then Parachute, and then this then get there new one coming out."
4,a surprise !!!,"i sort of stumbled on this cd accidently. i wasn't old enough to live the glory days of Cream, but i certainly have an appreciation for some good music. and this cd blew me away. i'm not the biggest fan of classic rock, but something about Baker Gurvitz Army made me a believer. was it the amazing drumming coupled with the fantastic fretwork or the smoky powerful vocals? it's all of it. by the time the third track (""Inside of Me"") came on, i knew that it would stay with me as one of my all time favorite songs of my whole life! the rest of the album is also great. there's so much feeling and power in the melodies and what i love about this band is that they have the tendency to sort of wander off into prog rock territory, but they never go that full route; seemingly out of respect for the song. i can respect that. this is a great collection for those who may want a unique twist on hard classic bluesy rock. it made me want more, that's for sure!"

5,Excellent - A Must-Read!,"Lucid, sparkling, and multi-faceted, this book is a gem of high quality. Unlike other research-oriented books on social anxiety and social phobia, this one provides diverse conceptual perspectives from various scientific disciplines and deftly integrates their findings, data, consensus and controversies into a relevatory whole. This resource is for professionals and nonprofessionals alike who want to get outside the box to get a fuller understanding of the complexity and uniqueness of the phenomena of social anxiety and social phobia. Destined to be a classic, this book would be a significant addition to any psychology library. I enthusiastically recommend it!"
1,Life among the Nupe Tribe in West Africa,"I believe this is a copy of the original work, but the print quality is extremely poor. Many pages are illegible. We will be returning our copy."
1,It looks nice!,"When it was working, it would randomly read a few pounds plus or minus actual weight. After about one day, mine developed a constantly stuck on backlight but otherwise blank and inoperative display. I give it one star for looking pretty.EDIT: Taylor replaced the scale (I had to ship the defective unit back) and the new one has been working fine for several months now. They didn't give me a hard time at all about exchanging the bad unit."
2,Scale not consistent,Bought this item as a Christmas gift and returning it today. It's just not consistent (changes about +/- .5 pounds nearly every time. And is about 3 pounds lower than two other scales.
3,Born in Detroit,Recently I realized that I have been living away from Detroit longer then I was there. This is sad since in many ways I am still a Detroiter and proud of this. As for the book I am enjoying it. Maybe I will not agree with everything but I can relate to a lot that is being written. Is Detroit a racist city. Probably. Did blacks mess things up. Probably. But then we all have to accept a little blame for the cities decline. Just read the book at take away what you want. Leave the rest.Made in Detroit
2,Capitalizing on the 8 mile mythos,"Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone. I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting. I suspect that the author was an ""academic-in-waiting"" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul. I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though. Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense. It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive."
2,Made in Detroit,"We found this book to be very negative and poorly put together. It's got a ""woe is me"" attitude. It's got a ""them and us"" mentality. That's too bad the author's world view is so narrow."
2,Demise of Detroit - Personal View,I purchased the book expecting it to be about the American auto industry's demise and its impact on Detroit. Instead it was a personal account on the experience of one individual during a change in social demographics in Detroit. I was disappointed.
3,White and private schooled in Detroit,"Also being a white kid in a black city, I can relate to this book, as I too was sent to private schools to avoid the ""dreaded"" public schools in the Motor City.CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRL by Michelle Kane is another good book set in the city of Detroit, although the main character is from a broken home and not as lucky as Clemens to have both parents to turn to in confusing times.Confessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl"
4,"Motown blues, blacks and whites",It's a white thing you wouldn't understand is the theme of this story. A coming of age for author and Detroit and neither one is pretty. Of local interest to Metro Detroiters since the white angst he describes isn't present in other cities. More tract than memoir but still a good read.
3,Very Original,"As I said before, very original writing. I really admire the writer for digging deep inside himself and being so honest.I noticed many people in reviews defending this person against the charge of being a racist.In my mind, most of us are racists. Those who say they are not, are usually not being honest with themself.A few very young people seem to be free of this curse, but it is something most of us must deal with (regardless of their race or upbringing).Those of us who take the high road, identify where this racism exists and take action to not let it effect how we judge people.Racism is a natural reaction to your environment and upbringing. Descrimination is a personal choice and a failure to allow your pragmatic and moral side to overcome your racism.Obviously, the author's upbringing made it natural for him to feel allot of racism. This being said, he seemed to deal with the issue head on and strived to be a moral person."
2,TOO MUCH SELF AGGRANDIZEMENT,If the author had spent more time telling us about Detroit and less time telling us how literate he is then it would have been a lot better book.
1,Made In Detroit,"If you wanted a sociological essay about Detroit this is for you.I expected a book about the demise of the motor industry in America. There is no mention about cars anywhere in the book except for some black reference to a 'ride'.This is not a book about carsIf you are into political science, sociology and anthropology this is your book."
2,Yawn!,"I was born in Detroit and lived in the Southwest side from '73 to '80, so I was interested to read this.It's mostly a bore, I'm sorry to say.Paul Clemens is an English major (and constantly touts how well-read he is) but is unable to do anything interesting with the written word.His prose is filled with cliches. Truly unimaginative and soulless writing.If there were interesting characters here, or interesting dialog, or interesting events, or stories, or anything... I could recommend this. But there aren't, so I can't.There are racist elements/ideas in the book, but anyone who lives in a multicultural environment will have racist thoughts. So Clemens gets points for honesty. I just wish this was a better book."
4,The Album that wrongfully gets overlooked,"Do not miss this soulful, sincere collection of Al Green's music ... just before his transition away from secular music. There is much to be moved by in these songs as one can almost feel Al contemplating his new life - both with excitement and trepidation. Start with the 1-chord masterpiece ""Something"" and prepare to be amazed."
4,Ways of use,These cloth diapers are truly great... when you know how to use them. They are a bit tricky. When worn normally they leaked but worn backwards they don't. I also added an extra pad for more absorbency. When washing these make sure you close the velcro otherwise lint sticks all over the velcro tabs. Mine have been in part-time use for over a year :)
1,"video quality stinks: jittery, pixelated, herky-jerky",I went looking for the dramamine after watching this DVD for just 5 minutes. It flickers. It's pixelated. It's full of DVD artifacts. The slow motion scenes are herky-jerky; more of a frame-by-frame than true slow motion. Don't waste your money on this one unless you enjoy getting headaches in back of your eyeballs.
4,Great moisturizer!,"This is a great soap. It moisturizes so very well and is great to have especially in the winter. My only complaint is that is melts way too fast in the shower. We don't have it under running water at all, but it still only lasts about a week for just two of us. I think that's a little extreme. It smells wonderful though and really makes a difference in your skin. Maybe the formulation for the moisturizing portion is what makes it disintegrate so quickly. Wish they could find a way to improve upon that. Otherwise, it's a very nice soap."
4,"good, but strong","It's soap, what can I say. The bars have a strong aroma, but it is a nice smell. Doesn't dry my skin."
5,"If you work out, you must have one of these bras!",I purchased this bra as a gift for my girlfriend who just took up kickboxing. SHE LOVES IT. No other bra comes close to providing the support this bra does.
2,Free with the Skymaster Binoculars I ordered.,"A tripod adapter is ment to keep binoculars ""vibration"" free on your tripod as to resolve shakey vision. This adaper apears strong in the hand, but when I attached my 15x70 binoculars to it, I realized that under its weight, the plastic becomes less stern and bends. The slightest touch to the binoculars will send them rotating left and right on the bending adapter. To ""resolve"" this, you have to keep your zygomatic bone (and the rest of bone surrounding your eyes) on the eye cups to keep the binoculars steady when viewing (or grab the binoculars, which was the tripods purpose). I know this was free, but I now need to go buy another tripod adapter, perhaps one made of metal, to properly support my binoculars."
2,Not so sturdy,"Though it says I could use it for Celestron Binocular 20-100X70, but it is good only for lighter ones, not for heavier ones, since it has only one bottom screw to hold and starts moving after using bit longer. Can only give 2 star. If you are buying for lighter Binocular, then it is good, otherwise, refrain."
5,One of the major memoriable influences among my reading,"I read this book when I was eleven or twelve years old, and I bawled my heart out at the conclusion. This was one of three works that moved and upset me enough for others to notice (I seem to remember my mom walking in from hearing me crying). Another was ""Sleepers"", by Lorenzo Carcaterra (whether or not it was true) that I read when I was eighteen, and the third is the movie of Hyde's ""Pay it Forward"" which I recently saw on Pay Per View this past summer. This novel, along with the others, has had a tremendous influence on me and has made a mark in my writing. Hopefully, the world will witness it sooner or later."
4,the most soothing sound of the 00's,"I am 15 and basically unique, I love Classical music, the H.M.S Pinafore is some of the best music I've ever heard in my life. My favorite song in the intire opera is ""A British Tar..."" in act one. I have been looking for this CD for ever, because lets face it... dragging around a record player were ever you go isnt fun. :-) I hope you injoy this music from the late 19th Century as much as I do because the music today is just... well its not music its Noise nothin else. This music so so beautifull to listen to you can sit forever and just listen to it a thousand times over.Thank You"
3,Amusing,"So many indie films try to differentiate themselves by going extreme. Often that means lots of gore, or lots of nudity. Few films travel the road of Psycho Sleepover. Yes, it has its share of gore and nudity, but it differentiates itself with mega-doses of surreal humor. Sure, the sleepover plus psycho killer combo has been done before. More than once. This takes it to the next level. Not one, not two, not even three psychos menace our heroine Debbie. No, we get forty. That kind of genre excess epitomizes the film. Where we expect one or two things to happen, twice as many happen instead. It leads to a level of surreality that's surprising in an indie horror film, and one that's appreciated."
3,Troma delivered on this one.,"Much better than the crappy Jessica Rabid. This is a very fun and old school no budget horror. Girls, gore and fun. Kinda clever too. Great rental."
1,LAME!,I'd rather use this dvd as a frisbee with my dog. Typical 'college-made' movie.....Waste of time and money unless you laugh hysterically at sub-B rated movies.
5,PLEASE republish this!,"Someone should republish this because it's superhumanly beautiful.Just read the cast list. All smart, Wagner-capable superstars. (If you haven't heard of Toni Blankenheim, he was understudy to Gustav Neidlinger. If you don't know who Gustav Neidlinger was, I'm sorry for you.)Kim Borg displays unusual humor as Shigolch and Erwin Wohlfahrt (the Painter) is so smart he risks upstaging his partners."
3,Sybil - Blutjung und Liebeshungrig,"Well,I have seen Sybil in much better action so I can not been completly satisfied with this one... But it is OK. Those are hers young days and everyone who loves Sybil must see her like that... Sorry for my English!"
2,Surrealistic and creepy,This one is to draw a different audience not a civil war report or product.If it was one of Stephen king film without the civil war background I would have rated differently.
5,a fine biography about a little known man of the people,"Undoubtedly best known for his authorship of the novel ""Pelle the Conqueror,"" I was particularly entertained with with this auto-biographical sketch by Nexo, especially in the way he was was able to so honestly depict his early life from the squalid slums of 1870's Copenhagen to the fishing villages on the island of Bornholm. Even though Nexo was a Communist at the time of the writing and lived in the Stalinist Soviet Union during much of his adult life, he writes a freshingly unpolemical accounting of his youth. He was chronically beset with glandular problems, and because of his diminutive stature was ridiculed frequently by other kids. I enjoyed most his funny self-effacing antecdotes."
1,"Old, slow technology","Beware, this receiver is old technology and was developed by idiots. The main issue I have with it is the horribly long time to acquire satellites, and unlike newer receivers, it doesn't obtain the programming guide in the background. So you have to explicitly ask it to retrieve the programming info, which can take 15 minutes sometimes. What idiot thought this was acceptable?"
1,Problems.,"Unit locks up after you watch Off Air D Local channels when you stitch to Dish Network channels, Get erros 005. You call DN and they don't help out., Beware this receiver is junk."
1,This song sucks,This is a really bad song. Fat Joe used to be good but now he's really gone down hill. I think Pun's death really got to him. We miss the old Fat Joe and we would be happy if he would come back.
5,a must have item,"Wether you need it to clean your ears, your navel or get the makeup off (amazingly thats what its main use is), Q-tips are the way to go. You can use these for what i already said as well as cleaning hard to reach areas in your computer, cleaning your VCR and video tapes (extreme caution with the tapes), and well, pretty much any hard to reach small area. You can usually get these fairly cheap (dollar tree has a nice 100 pack and the quality is nice). So no home should be without these so get yours today."
1,No star would be more accurate,"All of the one star reviews are right on. This book sucks! These are the most cynical people I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. Fortunately for me I don't intend on encountering the last 60% of them. Once you start to fall in a hole, you don't have to go the rest of the way to figure out that it isn't going to end well. This is the one time I wish I was reading a paperback instead of a Kindle because it would at least give me a small amount of pleasure to pitch it violently into the bottom of the trash can."
4,Worst Noel - Funny,I enjoyed the stories very much especially the one by Cynthia Kaplan. Almost choked I was laughing so hard when I read it.
1,I gave it one star because you can't give it a zero!,"This is not only the ""Worst Noel"" it's probably the worst Christmas book- or worst book ever! I fought my way through the whole thing and I can say this: Whoever is responsible for this book owes me around 10 hours of hard labor."
2,"Ugh, bah humbug","Maybe my review isn't fair because I couldn't make myself go on after reading the first 3 shorts stories. I did laugh out loud at the deer accident, but then even that story lost my interest. I'll try to force myself to read on, but I assume they put the better stories near the front, so I'm not very hopeful. Can't recommend."
1,Whining New Yorkers haven't a clue!,"An abysmal collection of foul-mouthed Northeasterners who have no clue what Christmas is truly about think that it is hilarious to present absurd caricatures of families from the South as ignorant hicks who cling to stupid, outdated traditions which are skewered on each page. Does this sound really funny? Then this is the book for you.There are some really funny elements of our modern-day Christmas celebrations which are ripe for humorous examination, but if your idea of cleverness and wit involves something more than cheap shots and four-letter obscenities you would do better to look elsewhere for a good read."
2,A little disappointed,I have to say that I am disappointed with this one. I now own about 6 Swarovski bracelets and this one is just as nice as the others but I bought it thinking it was a three/twisted bracelet. It comes as three separate bracelets and I suppose you can twist them together but I thought from the photo that they came that way. So I am giving them less stars in the rating just because it's 3 separate bracelets.
2,pro publisher,"I received this item with excitement but after using it for a few hours, found the product was not user friendly, the process does not flow as I would expect it to."
3,Cheap quality but serviceable,"I read the reviews and they were pretty accurate. It is just cheap particle board and the handles on the doors are plastic made to look like metal, but it suits my purpose. However, when you get to the part where you have to stand it up, make sure you use two people because the legs are not at all sturdy and the way it goes together and the fact the particle board is cheap will cause the top where they are connected to come apart and start to break up if you only have one person and you try to pick it up from the top and stand it up. Other than that it looks fine and will serve my purpose so I won't be returning it. Once I am done with renovations this place will just revert back into a rental property anyway."
3,"Good neutral, unscented emollient",I've been using this almond oil for a few months now and its quality is unwavering. It is a great emollient but since it is oil it can stain clothes if worn too early after the oil has been applied. Its being natural is probably better for the skin.
1,Wast of Money,This product never worked at day one. The electric shock does not shock even when I put my finger on the wire. This product is a wast of money.
3,Works Depending on What You Need,"There are 3 poles that one sticks in the ground; there's a deer attractant to draw them near, and it uses AA batteries to give the critters a mild shock. Simple idea.The instructions tell you the limitations: one, it depends on the deer concentration; works best in the town where there are fewer; works least in a rural, non-residential setting. We live rural-residential, and have lots of deer. Secondly, it states it covers 1200 sq. ft.- that's like a 30' X 40' area. Finally, it's affected by climate, i.e., moisture.We, in general, like having deer around; however, we want to keep them away from our flowers, trees, and garden. I just bought some baby fruit trees, and it seems to work. How long I don't know?You'll have to consider the cost and what you want to protect. I think it's probably easier and more secure to use fencing, dogs, and chose plants deer don't eat."
4,Havahart 5250 Electronic Deer Repellent,"The product seems to be working thus far. Deer activity in my yard has decreased significantly. I use the product in conjunction with deer netting for certain flowers and plants which also helps I'm sure, but the deer droppings and digging in flower beds that I once experienced have ceased completly since I started using the product."
2,Short Review--Doesn't Work on Our Whitetail,"I live in a place that is overrun by deer and frankly the package map did not recommend this product for an area this populated with deer. We set this up on the property where we has been trying for 3 years to grow apple trees. Two things keep getting in the way, late frost, and whitetail deer. The product is supposed to attract the deer to the repellant, then delivers a mild shock to keep them away from the area. The attractant doesn't work. The deer walk right by it and are not interested in it at all. So for our situation in Montana, this product does not work."
1,No stars!,"Total failure. Most posts administered no perceptible shock to me, though batteries were inserted as instructed. Deer knocked all posts down and continued to break in and feast. Returned the items."
4,Electronic deer repellent,Had the product for 1 month and so far so good no deer attacks on the plants. Only negative the odor oil needs to be replenished after each rain storm.
3,"Good in Theory, Not as Good in Practice","The theory here is that you can prevent deer from coming around by luring them in to these stakes as the most attractive place to go, and then when they come in closer it zaps them.Unfortunately this means that these stakes have to have the scent added to them over and over, and have to be placed in a way that it's more inciting than your trees or flowers. If setup right, they seem to keep the deer away, but for easy of use I prefer a bar of soap with a hole drilled in it (like ivory spring), or use milorganite on the ground. Both which also use the deer's heightened sense of smell, but to keep them away instead of luring them in and zapping them."
1,These did not work for us,"Used these according to manufacturer's directions. Deer still came, still nibbled on our hostas which were near these stakes. It might be a hit or miss product that works for some but they did not work for us. We also have a very large yard and tons of plants (that are supposedly good for areas with deer but tell the deer that!). You do have to make sure they are working and scented which we did but over time we did not see evidence that the deer were deterred from entering our yard. Maybe if you had a ton of them it would work better but then it would also be very expensive. For now we are sticking with our spray on deer repellent (liquid fence) which works great and although expensive is more cost effective than these."
3,Mixed Results.,"This product supposedly works by attracting the deer using an acorn scent (a saturated cotton ball that you put in the top of the plastic scent stick) & then shocking the deer's nose when the deer leans in to eat the stick.I can't tell if the product works. The deer in our yard seem to love our nut trees & have almost destroyed a couple of them. We put the scent stakes out about 3 weeks ago & we still see 3-4 deer lounging in our yard (a typical number). I haven't caught them near the trees, so don't know if the scent stick works or if the deer just aren't interested in our trees at the moment.So, the jury is still out. I'm skeptical about luring animals to where you don't want them & then shocking them to keep them away. We'll keep using the scent sticks & I'll post as we watch the deer hang out (yes, one will even stand in the yard & watch my car drive down the driveway - not 20 feet away)."
2,No evidence of it working,"I agree with the one-star review titled ""Pointless"" written by ""Kitten Kisser"". I live in an area that falls between the last two categories ""Rural residential"" and ""Rural non-residential agricultural"" - I have high deer density, damage is frequent but unpredictable. Since I installed them, I haven't seen any deer in my yard, but my schedule has been erratic, so it's not unusual. I've seen deer damage on plants near one of the three repellent stakes, but not near the other two. But then, I don't know if I would have seen damage on those plants if the stakes were not there.I will continue to re-scent the stakes, at least as long as the supply lasts. And I'll move the stakes, as the instructions say. But since my walnut tree got partly eaten, I don't have high hopes for these stakes doing the job."
3,Effective...so far.,"We decided to use this deer repellent to try to keep the deer away from our ancient pear tree. We installed the system about a month ago and of course, it's a bit hard to tell if it's actually working. I can tell you, though, that there have been no deer tracks within the area that we placed the stakes. A good sign!The only reason I gave this product three stars instead of five is because there is little to no information that comes with the system. A comprehensive set of directions would have been wonderful. Also, you have to really keep an eye on it so that you will know when you have to change the battery. Other than that, it seems to be working just fine."
3,Problems out of the box,"This review is based upon my own experience - which is rather limited as the product was defective out of the box. Only one of the stakes (out of three that came with the set) worked whatsoever. The other two were dead on arrival. Based upon the quality concerns, I would rate this as a ""warning"" to others. The one stake that did work is quite safe, the description is accurate, it is a low level shock and nothing like an electric fence. Gentle but annoying. Overall, there seems to be a quality concern with this product. Since this was reviewed via the Vine program it isn't worth the time/effort to pursue but suffice to say, if I had purchased the product, it would be returned immediately. Overall, I would hesitate to suggest this to others based upon the erratic quality of the items. On the other hand, it is a safe and very easy to use product at a fraction of the time, effort and cost associated with other options which is why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars for a review."
3,Ok - But If Your Deer Are Clever,"We have a problem with deer chewing our tomato plants down every summer. We put these out a few weeks ago, and we have watched the deer get shocked (pretty powerful), but we have also watched them cleverly figure out how to just walk between them. I suppose that we need more than the few that came in the box. To me, it remains simpler just to encase the plants in a chickenwire-type fence."
2,Interesting Gadget,"This electronic deer repellent is interesting, but I'm afraid that there's little way to know if it works. The idea is to entice deer with a scent so that they touch a set of wires looped at the top of the device, which sends an electrical shock to the deer. The instructions indicate that it is not intended for an area with a high concentration of deer and that you need to rotate through different scents to keep them from associating the shock with the scent item. The units came with an acorn scent and I can imagine teaching the deer to avoid acorns while they continue to eat your fruit trees or scrape their horns on our aspen trees. I'm not sure whether they have reduced the damage that the deer have done in my yard, but my dog avoids acorns with a passion now. I guess that's good though ... right? I would say nice try, but maybe a bit off the mark."
3,Deers Begone.,"I have been using this product for awhile to see if it made a big difference. It works in a small area, I tried it on a large area and the Deer still came. I tried it around my backyard about 50 feet and it actually worked better. I think the deer get smart after awhile and go around it. The babies run one to three but the parents will try try again. Overall for a small area this will work great for you. A large area you need to adjust all to see how much you can get covered"
3,Counterintuitive,"This seemed to work OK, but it didn't protect my garden. Guess there are other creatures of the night interested in my water melons, beans and tomatoes.The thing that I don't understand is why you would attract the deer with some sort of good smelling stuff to the deer, and then shock them to get them to stay away. Now it the smell was water mellon or bean=based, I might understand the logic."
1,This ineffective product adds to frustration with deer,"The reviews are all over the landscape on this product. I scanned the 91 reviews of this product written to date to see if there is any pattern on the effectiveness of the repellent with regard to season or to location in the U.S. I could not detect a pattern other than the fact that most reviews are from the eastern United States. There was one review from my area, San Francisco Bay, a five-star review on 15 May 2011.My review is one star because I found the product ineffective in several tests. For example, after noticing that a deer had just eaten a part of a flowering head of a sunflower, I set up the Havahart 5250. The next morning the rest of the sunflower head was eaten. Other attempts to disrupt the walking paths or corridors of deer were unsuccessful. Even increasing the amount of the repellent did not deter the deer. My verdict: save your time and money."
2,Didn't work for me....,"So I set this up. I even read the instructions. The instructions say to place it at the entrance of your yard rather than near your garden. Well my yard is wide open, no fence, hence the problem with deer in the first place. So I can't do that. maybe that's why it isn't doing it's job for me. The shocker definately works, I tried it. the logic that a deer will smell the scent, shock themselves, then be detered makes sense unless you have 4-5 deer that travel together. The unit takes 15 minutes to charge in between shocks. IF one gets shocked, there are still other deer that can keep eating my vegetables. I don't even know if I'm shocking one of them. I just know that this isn't working the way that I hoped. I gave it two stars because mechanically it works, I just don't think the product concept it as sound as it is made out to be. I will get one of those motion detecting hose sprayers that amazon sells, that is pretty fool proof. Next year will be a better season..hopefully."
3,Get a dog,"If you're growing a real garden and want to protect your corn patch, these devices just aren't going to be enough. Deer around here are practically tame (rats with antlers) and are not phased by expensive little zappers like these. (I was actually hoping they would repel the racoons which are a worse problem.) In addition, since they're battery operated, they are not cost effective.I recommend getting a big scary dog and staking him/her out in the garden during harvesting season. Woof woof!"
3,Clever Solution to a Serious Problem,"Herds of deer patrol our yard and shrubs and they've done serious damage. We've fenced our vegetable garden and put netting over other shrubs that we don't want the deer to eat, but such solutions are not always convenient. This is a clever solution that doesn't take a lot of space or skill to implement but isn't cheap either. So far the deer have kept their noses and mouths off of our unfenced tomato plants protected by one of these. Some otherwise vulnerable flowers appear to be receiving protection from the others. Testing to make sure that they're working involves a mild shock. Oh deer."
3,Early returns are good.,"It will take time for me to be sure, but one week into my use of this method for keeping deer away from my gardens, but there are fewer signs of recent deer presence. So from the perspective of ""driving away the critters"", I'm inclined to recommend it.It's easy enough to use. One stake should cover atoub 1200 square feet of ground. Add a few drops of the scented lure onto the unit, put the batteries in and place the stakes according to the illustrations provided. The lure draws the deer in and once they're close enough, they'll receive 400 volts that ""should"" scare the deer away and imprint the fear deep enough to keep them away.The problem that I have is that in order for the repellent to work, it has to lure the deer close. That could bring additional deer into the area, which could defeat the overall purpose of the product. But only time will tell, by the end of the summer I might have a better idea about this."
2,Seems to attract deer more than repel them,"We live in suburbia - 1/2 acre to 1 acre plots - in Westchester County New York. Lots of deer. These have an odd way of working. They actually use a scent to ATTRACT deer, then they use a shock to repel them. It's a bit odd. Unless the deer actually touch the wires, they are never repelled - only attracted.I haven't done a statistical study, but I would say that the deer are MORE active on our property than they used to be. Previously, they would wander through. Now, they are curious and stick around because of the scent. I have only seen one deer (a huge buck) touch the wires. It only seemed mildly phased - and didn't run away or anything.These are also very dangerous if you have kids around. There are package warnings, but the wires give off a pretty good shock to humans - probably not enough to do any damage, but pretty unpleasant."
2,Don't see any less deer,I put these up in my yard around the fence line. The deer still came into my yard. Didn't seem to make any mind of these stakes. The instructions say to place them at the areas away from what you want protected. I followed the directions and the deer still enters the yard and eats the plants.Maybe if you combine these with other deterrents they may work better. I don't know. These don't seem to work.
2,waste of money,"The deer ""repellent"" (odd name for a product that actually contains scent lure) is a high-maintenance, low-results product whose only real purpose seems to be to separate you from your money.The idea is that you're going to lure the deer to the stick, and then shock them in hopes that they will run away. What happens tomorrow as they're passing by? They smell the lure again and head over towards your plants again. Ask yourself... are they going to shock themselves on the stick again, or eat your plants?Exactly."
3,Wait and See,"The concept sounds good--depending on the learning curve of deer. Unfortunately, I'll need to wait till winter to see if these work because that is when the deer enter my yard and eat my beautiful cedar trees!I am disappointed that the acorn lure scent has to be applied weekly--or even more often if it rains. You would think a slightly more permanent method could be used. I would also agree with an earlier reviewer who commented on how the poles are very noticeable with the red tops.If it works . . . then I'll overlook both of my criticisms."
3,Too Early to Tell,"The garden has only been in for a short period of time so the plants are very small and not producing. It is also spring, a time all the berries, shoots, twigs, nuts and leaves are tender and plentiful, so the garden holds no great enticement. I will have to wait and come back when it is hot, dry and the deer are hungry.I am rating it a 3 because it requires more work than I expected so I want to warn everyone about that. A garden takes a great deal of work on its own so that in itself is a disappointment. If it doesn't work well it will be a huge disappointment."
3,Too hard,"Maybe my dog has extra sensitive gums, but this ball was just too hard for how she likes to play/chew/squeak her toys. It caused her gums to bleed after just a minute of play, so it's out of the toy box."
1,Wrong color,"I ordered this ball because it is orange. My dog is going blind and only likes orange toys, probably because this is the only color she can still see. I was very disappointed when the package arrived and the ball was dark blue. My dog was at my side and she got so excited and wanted the toy, so I gave it to her. She played with it for a few minutes, but could not see it and just abandoned it. Also, it is too tough on her gums and doesn't squeak much. Oh well. Still searching for an orange spiky toy..."
5,Another great Siddons book,This is a great book. It is not what I expected but equally as wonderful as I expected. You can relate to all characters and know someone like each one. Surprise twists everywhere
1,My last Siddons book...so disappointed!,"Just finished this book...and boy,was I disappointed...I was bored with the storyline after a few pages but kept plogging along,thinking it will get better shortly...Was I wrong! I was a huge fan of Siddons but after this one,no more...The characters are totally shallow & boring...the ending is fuzzy and at that point,I really didn't care who lived or not....Save your money Siddons fans....You will regret buying this!"
4,Four Sorority Sisters Come Together Again,"Overall, I enjoyed this book fine. It speaks of four sorority sisters from a Southern campus in the 60's. They are bound by a rare, early friendship-spending two idyllic spring breaks at Nag's Head, North Carolina, the isolated strip of barrier islands where grand old weatherbeaten houses perch defiantly at the edge of a storm-tossed sea.The characters in the book are elegant Kate, walking a tightrope over an abyss of lies. Cecie is the sensitive, sensible, self-contained one. Ginger was the heiress, sexy, vibrant, richer than sin, and Fig, the eccentric character, very brilliant yet poor.The book is very good. Very richly written with a lot of detail and description."
2,Do you love the Outer Banks?,"If you love the Outer Banks, don't read this book. I was very dissapointed. The story starts out pretty interesting, then it gets really shallow and the ending unfortunately is very tacky. It reminded me way too much of the ""love/hate"" booklets you can buy at a newspaper stand on the street. I do not recommend this book, I was amazed it made it on a Bestseller list at all."
4,A Solid Story,"We have romance, suspense, and some interesting characters in this novel. This is the first Anne Rivers Siddons book I have read (actually, I should say, listened to). Perhaps, initially, I felt it was a bit too maudlin, what with all the intertwined sad events occuring to the main characters. Siddons, however, has a tremendous talent towards intertwining characters with page turning plot. Maybe a little too Stephen Kingish at the end but who would have thought it?? Get the book and read it"
1,Feh!,"This has to be my least favorite ARS book. What a disaster. The characters were all way overblown and stereotyped, and everyone just seemed so darn shallow. I like the comment that it seemed like Stephen King finished the book. Very true. Overall, a giant ""feh""!Skip this book."
3,Very Entertaining,This is the first Siddons novel I have read. I found the characters very well drawn and the story line gripping. The premise of reuniting 4 college sorority sisters after 28 years promises a good story and Siddons delivers this. I really enjoyed it.
2,A disappointing read,"I've always enjoyed Siddon's descriptions of the locations and milieu of the characters in her books, and this one continues at a high level on that score. But the plot line was not engaging. Very slow. I kept waiting for something intriguing to happen, as it does in other of her books. I'd skip this one and read another of Anne Rivers Siddon's wonderful books."
4,Another super read by Anne Rivers Siddons,"I wondered about this book at the outset because the first few chapters depressed me. But the author really pulls you in with characters that are interesting in and of themselves and moreso because of the realtionships between them. Her themes resonate with females generally, but she's also a beautiful, witty writer. The end of the book especially is riveting! This would be a great summer read."
1,Why did anyone do anything?,"Kate apparently couldn't make up her mind. About whom to love, whom to befriend, whom to trust, whom to screw. She seems to drift along attaching herself to others, hoping they will give her an identity. The only thing she does really well is cry. At the drop of a hat. I have noticed crying in all Siddons' books. Crying seems to substitute for deep emotion. Mild emotion. Slight emotion. UP ISLAND was better, but Siddons never seems to lose her Southern Belle persona, wherever she may place her characters."
3,had me going until the end,"Siddons does a good job of character development and I got into the book. Living near the Outer Banks, being a member of a sorority, and knowing what small town southern life is all about helped to develop a kinship with the main character. But Siddons lost her touch toward the end. She throws such a poor twist in the plot, that it leaves the reader behind and wishing they had never even finished the book. So much effort seemed to be put into the beginning but the end seemed very hastily written."
2,Very disappointed in the ending.,"I am a big fan of Anne Rivers Siddons. ""Fault Lines"" is one of my all time favorite books, the one that got me hooked on her. I loved the way ""Outer Banks"" started and carried out the plot. I thought the characters were well developed..until the end. The entire book came to it's unrealistic conclusion in about 10 pages with many unanswered questions. If CeCe could only leave Vinnie's mother for 3 more days, how could she stay at Kate's for weeks? Who shot Fig, Kate or CeCe? And Alan seemed pretty happy even though his wife cheated on him. This was the worst Siddons book I have read. I am still a fan, and will read more, because I know she is capable of much better!"
2,Not very helpful,"I didn't find this book very helpful. I am a law student with substantial law office experience. I was looking for something more specific. This was very basic. For instance, what kind of furniture you need in a law office lobby. Not real helpful."
2,Very Basic,This book is very very basic with common sense ideas on how to start a practice. Not much real help.
1,slippery and thin,"this grip is slippery and too thin for my play. Also, sweating of hand makes it quite uneasy for play."
1,"Tiring, tiresome melodrama","There's not a single believable character, not a single believable scene in this movie. The tone is relentlessly melodramatic, as if these phony characters live right at the edge of hysteria every second of their lives. Everyone is always angry, and nearly every line is either shouted or snarled. That people who so annoy and irritate each other would have remained friends for a decade or even a year is ridiculous. Watching this foolish movie is tiring and tiresome."
2,The New twenty,"A group of friends. Very PC group of people. There is a gay, there is an asian girl and boy, there is somebody handsome and there is also somebody less handsome. So we have this mixture but does it ""taste"" good?Well, it doesn't :(The plot is average. The director apparently was too afraid to present the whole spectrum of gay relationship including sexlife (although, he shot several scenes of straight sex...).Are the characters likeable? To some degree. Unfortunately, I couldn't neither associate myself with any of 'em nor I give a damn about their problems.And the cover! Was it supposed to be a candy for gay viewers? Don't let them trick you.Rent before buying."
2,Disappointing sound quality,"I bought these earbuds to replace the buds that came with my Sansa MP3 player that I broke. The sound quality on these buds is inferior to the Sansa ones they replaced (couldn't find Sansa replacement buds). Also, it has this weird assymetrical cord with the left bud cord longer. It's a deliberate design feature that I could find absolutely no point to. I would have returned them but with return shipping, my shipping costs alone would have almost equalled the purchase price. If you care about sound quality, keep looking past these."
2,OK,"the earphones have pretty good sound (compared to the ones that come with ipods) they can handle the bass that the ipod earphones can'tbut they do not stay in my ear at all! i have to KEEP ON adjusting them in order to prevent them from falling out. if i didn't do this, they would fall out so easily! the cord is too short and yes, i do know they go around the back of the neck but there really is no slack on the cord. even though there is an extension cord, the cord is too long! there is no medium! also the plug in for the extension cord weighs down the earphones, so i can't walk too fast or else the plug will start swinging around and eventually make my earphones fall out."
1,Thrown away within a day of purchase,"Just want to reinforce how dissatisfactory this product is. Recognize I'm going to get low performance with an earbud + ipod, but the sound here is unreasonably tinny, with zero bass even with the bass booster on an ipod. Moreover, I had to turn up the volume on my ipod to hear anything, which in turn produced a bunch of uncomfortable ""background air"". I bought these to replace the Philips Surround Speaker earbuds I previously owned (which are cheaper); those earbuds take some more getting used to as far as ear fit goes, but produce a richer sound. Look elsewhere."
1,Not worth the hassle,"These earphones irritate me. A lot. The sound is fine, and I don't mind that they don't block out noise, but the technical design of them is horrible. Like the previous reivew said, the extender part is heavy and pulls on the earphones; the asymmetrical cabling exaggerates this tendency on the shorter side. The rubber of the wires completely defeats the purpose of the cabling for tangle management; tangles do not slip out easily. Lastly, the length of the cables are all wrong. The cables are too long with the extender, yet too short without the extender to rest neatly in a waist-level jacket pocket. Would not buy again."
2,$10 earphones for the price of $30,"i picked these up at target and was not impressed at all. the sound was just ok average, but what i did not like was how these sat in my ear - i could not get a good and secure fit. my previous (average too) sony ex71 were better fitting, better sounding, comparable price headphones"
1,Terrible,"I'm on my way to the store to return these right after I finish this review.Like many others, I bought these to use with my ipod. There is almost no bass response and the volume level is very low. I had to turn up my ipod all the way simply to hear the music. Just to make sure I wasn't crazy, I switched back and forth between these and the original ipod earbuds. The ipod earbuds have more bass and volume by far."
1,Who has ears this big?!,"I could not even get these earphones to stay in my ears. Yes, they have 3 sizes of plugs, but that wasn't the problem, the plastic ear bud was too big to fit in my ear. I don't have big ears but I doubt my ears are smaller than average. I thought maybe my boyfriend could use them but he said the same thing, they don't fit securely in the ear because of the size of the earbud itself. I know these got mostly good reviews, but seriously, if you have even slightly small ears, or even if you don't... these may not work for you."
2,"Good sound, bad cord","I got these to supplement a set of Bang & Olfsen phones (good sound, poorplug design.) These sound almost as good but the uneven cord lengths, a heavy cord weight, when the extension is used, made this hard for me to use. It means that the ear buds were always popping out when i walked.I gave them to my son after a few weeks. These are better for using with a computer than an ipod."
4,"great headphonea, perfext fit","Best headphones I've tried over the years, perfect ear seal. My only complaint is they no longer make the SHE9500, which were the same design, in black."
2,Two Stars !,I REGRET purchasing these headphones. The sound quality is decent. But everything else important about these headphones SUCKS. If I wasn't so lazy I would have shipped them back!
2,eh...too many flaws,"Though these are supposed to be fairly equivalent to similar looking buds from Sony, I found them far less comfortable (even wtih the adjustable bud covers) and tempramental. The extension is totally useless thus far - without it, the cord is too short (although it might work for an armband) and with it, slightly longer than necessary and gets caught on coat buttons, bag corners, etc.They're serviceable, but nothing to write home about."
1,No good,I tried these as a replacement for ipod buds -- which are uncomfortable for me -- and these are no comparison. Sound was muffled with no clarity. Still looking for something decent...
2,messy cord and sound,"I had these buds for a while, constantly flustered by the crappy, rubbery cord and ill-fitting earpieces. I THOUGHT the sound was good, with VERY solid bass, until I bought a pair of <over-priced, trendy, look-at-me-earbuds>. Comparing the two back-to-back, I realized how messy the Phillips sounded. The heavy bass completely muffled the mid-range. Poor fit, poor cord, and the sound doesn't hold a candle to better buds. Skip 'em."
1,"Cheap quality, you get what you pay for.","Decent, if you absolutely need headphones. Has very little bass compared to other headphones. While working out these headphones constantly fall out, regardless of bud size used. buy something else and save your time and money. I've had much better luck with sony."
1,"Just go with something different, save yourself","This has to be a case of a good idea, that just doesn't pan out.First off, the cord is short. 2ft + 2ft extension really isn't. The ear buds are designed to route behind your neck, thereby eleminating a full foot of cord length. Be prepared for a 3ft true length at best.Second, when you do route the cord behind your head, anytime you turn your head, it pulls on the earbud on the short side...everytime. Very annoying.Third, if you route the cord normally in front of you, one side is x3 longer than the other (because it was designed to go behind your neck). It doesn't work well, one side it taut the other has a ton of slack.It makes be wonder if they ever actually wore the earbuds before they put them up for sale.Lastly, the sounds was decent, good enough.Priced too high, annoying fit, not a whole lot of ""premium"" about these premium headphones. Stay away."
2,"Good sound, horrible everything else","These buds do not stay in my ears, regardless of the size plastic thing I put on them. I literally cannot do ANYTHING with them in because I have to constantly readjust them. I cannot even sit at my computer with them in and have them stay in my ears. The sound is fairly decent, especially for the $18 I spent on them, but had I known it would be so hard to keep them in my ears, I never would have bought them. IPOD ear buds have always been fine in my ears, I'm not sure why these suck so bad"
3,A romance novel,"After reading the sunne in splendour by Penman and the warlord chronicles by Cornwell this book was a big disappointment. However, if you want more romance than historical fiction this book is for you"
5,FLAWLESS,"It's really a snap installing the kit. You only need to know your ISP information which is basically username and password along with type of connection and just follow a short set of instructions.Once product is installed it has great coverage; even for the price. I can be the farthest away in the house, from the router, and it still works great! I recommend this kit as a solution for those of you who have an older model laptop without the built in wireless card. I shopped around for the same model around and nothing comes close to the price i got.Excellent deal!"
4,Can't go wrong with Linksys :),"I worship Linksys, I'm in the networking field and I love the reliability and support of Linksys. The feature set is rich, and the devices are built solid. As always, thanks Linksys for another great product, and thanks to AMAZON for AMAZING prices!"
2,"Router works, card only infrequently","I had no problem with the router set up and using the wired connections works fine. The card will only work infrequntly. Once it has acquired a connection it works great, but I haven't been able to predict when it will decide to connect. I too have messed about with all the parameters. It seems that you need to change something on the router (anything) and that might get the router and the card to talk. I have a Windows 2000 laptop."
3,Does the job when its working,Have to reset it alot which means unplugging it for a few minutes and plug it back in. No reset button. Other than that it is ok. Going to buy a new one and keep this as a backup. Not sure if I would have bought it having known this.
3,Learning experience,"I thought I had a good buy when I saw this on the website, but I wasn't really sure what I was getting into. I enjoy the functionality and practicality of the router, but I am using it withing an existing LAN within my college's network. It was a little tricky learning how to deal with the proxy settings and how to disable DHCP. Even though it obviously isn't a ""plug and play"" situation here, I would have done it all over again if I needed to. It was a valuable learning experience and an affordable investment."
2,WPC11 version 4 does not work with Linux yet,"I have this package. I have been trying to get it working in Linux for the past 4 days. After installing 3 different distros, i still am not able to get the pcmcia working. From what it looks like, this new version has a new chipset from the previous versions, and it is not being recognized at the moment.If you're running Linux and want a Linksys wireless product, then go for the seperate items, and get the WPC11 version 3 PCMCIA card. At least that works. Otherwise, you could wait for an update.Just my $.02."
3,"Nice combo, but technology not yet reliable","I really like this set, with easy to load software for the card and a nice web interface for the router. There are occasions where it has difficulty connecting to the internet, and further investigation has led me to believe it is some type of interference. Be aware that it uses the 2.4 Ghz frequency, which is also used by many cordless phones and bluetooth devices. While there should not be any trouble in theory, this is not the case in the real world. But, if you have to have a wireless set, this one is an excellent choice."
3,Works well once set up,"Setting up the access point was a little difficult, but once the right settings were tweaked, this thing hums along with little problems. The signal strength is high even to the backyard: makes working outside on the nice days easy. The security options are nice, since this can screen wireless cards unless you input their hardware address. Some fiddling with ports was necessary to get the virtual private networking (VPN) to go through correctly, but some help can be found on the internet. This access point also plays well with other vendor's PC cards.However, there are some issues with the PC card. This setup comes with version 4 (v4) of the card. There are SEVERE issues if you need to use a VPN to log into work. This card simply will not do it--but oddly, version 3 (v3) WILL. This is known on Linksys' website, but no fix is available. The v4 also seems to get worse reception than v3.Overall, it can work well, but be careful with the version of the PC card."
4,Works good,"Everything works well on this router. I was able to install it and get everything up and running in just a few minutes.The only complaint that I have is that my old Linksys router had a DMZ port on the back that could be configured to be permanently outside the firewall. This made it great for hosting internet games like Ghost Recon. I could switch between DMZ and firewall by just moving the cat5 cable. This router doesn't have that port. Instead, you have to configure a static IP address to be outside the firewall. This one is not as easy to switch between Firewall and DMZ.The wireless range is good. I put the router in my basement and I can connect with my laptop in every room in the house. Including the second floor (3 floors above the basement). The signal strength is excellent and the signal quality is excellent."
1,Have fun trying to get wireless connections to work...,"I recommended to one of my friends that they buy this product. They wanted to share an internet connection and the Linksys products I use and have installed for other people in the past have been great. Installation was a snap but we could not get the wireless device to be able to access the internet. The desktop PC plugged into the router with a cable worked, but not the wireless device. After 4 hours of trying all different types of things, downloading updated drivers, and two calls to Linksys support, I returned this. I bought the separate router and separate PC card, installed it and had it working in 10 minutes. The PC card in this bundle is marked as version 4 and the one we purchased separate was a version 3 card. Not sure what the deal is but I couldn't get this product to work with a Windows 2000 laptop."
1,wireless access point connection drops packets- unreliable,I have 2 notebook adapters and a PC card. The PC installation was difficult in getting the drivers to work. For the first 2 months I had no problems. I am having constant problems having days they work and on other days it doesn't. I tried Pinging and I can see sometimes it sends the packets and receives none.I believe from reading on the internet it has to do with the firmware. I am no expert in wireless devices but these were not my expectations of this product. Neither did Linksys send me my rebate having called them five times.
1,Horrible range in my home,"Basically the router works fine, except it has a RANGE OF ABOUT 10 FEET IN MY HOUSE!I kid you not, no matter where I place the router in my bedroom (the only place where cable is installed) my laptop gets ""Low"" reception in the hallway four feet away, ""Very Low"" reception in my living room 10 feet away, and practically NO RECEPTION in my office 50 feet away. You can actually stand at the router and see the laptop 10 feet outside the door and still the reception is horrible.This router is useless for me. Maybe it's my house or something, but that's just sad."
2,too fake,A very disappointing product. The picture definitely makes it look better than it really does. The flowers look and feel like plastic...not silk. I bought it for a friend for Christmas but I'm going to have to find something else. It's just too ugly to give as a gift.
4,Good Memories,"For anybody who loved reading about science fiction TV series way back in the 1970s, this book is a great memory. I found a copy at a now-defunct flea market when I was a teenager, and was thrilled to find episode guides to series such as ""One Step Beyond,"" ""Night Gallery"" ""Star Trek"" and all the Irwin Allen TV shows too (""Lost in Space,"" ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" and so on). I didn't care for the author's obvious disrespect and dislike for ""Space: 1999,"" always one of my favorites (and then a new show!) but it was still clear that so much research and work went into the book. If you can find a copy of this today, it's very much worth getting. There's information on everything from Made-For-TV Movies of the age (""Gargoyles!"" ""Ritual of Evil!"" ""Baffled!""), to British programming, and Saturday-morning genre efforts too."
3,Fun game for younger kids,"This is a very fun game for younger kids who have trouble with the harder, faster paced games. Still need to learn some moves that can be challenging but not impossible, like some games. I would definitely recommend for kids 10 and under. One negative is that the game does not automatically save to the memory cartridge, and it's hard to return to the save menu from game play (you have to go all the way back to the main menu). If you forget to save or quit by mistake, you have to start over from the beginning. Can be frustrating."
4,A lot of fun,"This game is a lot of fun. Its easy enough to not be frustrating, yet still challenging enough to be quite enjoyable. The graphics and game play are top notch! If you are a fan of disney and are looking for a fun time, this is a great game!"
2,OK rental,"My children, girls 6 and 5, tired of this game quickly. It's an OK rental for the kids, I suppose, because it's easy to learn and Donald is amusing as he goes quackers. In addition, it's instructional for adults, who would do well to avoid going quackers. But the game pales in comparison to my girls' favorites -- Donkey Kong and both Banjos. In my opinion, those are the only games one needs."
2,Learning any Wing Chun.....,...from a book requires excellent photography so that the subtleties of hand and arm positions can be captured. This otherwise fair book suffers from very dark photographic reproduction that renders it largely unusable.
5,Best book series out there.,I reccomend the entire set. Chao gives details not found in any other book or video series. The 1 inch punch training info alone is worth the price of the set.
5,a Classic Wing Chun Text,A classic text covering the complete Sil Lim Tao level training of the Yip Man Wing Chun school. This first book in the series (there are 3 volumes in all) lays the foundation needed to fully digest the material covered in the remaining 2 volumes. A must-have for the serious Wing Chun media collector. The drills and exercises presented alone make this increasingly difficult to find series well worth the asking price. Old school Yip Man Hong Kong lineage Wing Chun.Note: The second volume in the series (Chum Kil) is almost impossible to find. This should be taken into account if you are attempting to collect the entire set.
3,Effective but uncomfortable,This product does do an excellent job keeping posture in check- but I can't bear to wear it too long because of the intense chaffing to the underarm area. No matter how I adjust the straps or how loose or tight I make the item- I can never get rid of the uncomfortable feeling in the underarm area.
5,Start your life today!,"Whether it's the Monday blues, the Wednesday boredom or Friday afternoon itch, we can all use a boost . With this book, the pick-me-up will come in the form of true inspiration by Bruce Rector, a seasoned and highly motivating speaker and writer. Jumpstart your day and start the rest of your great, fabulous life TODAY by reading this book."
5,Hilarious!,This book was a riot. My favorite had to be either the Blue M&M or the Exxon gas. This book had me laughing out loud.
3,solid but slow,"The book is literate and the characters are interesting. In fact, I would have liked to have learned more about the women and spent less time in the high school gym playing badminton and on the plot thread concerning the student(s). The story drags there. In a novel this short I think the author needed every page she could get for character development. The book seemed to struggle a little over whether it was a romance or a social commentary on the pitfalls of our education systems. Having said that, there were good parts too. The love scenes were sensetive and well-drawn. The family dynmaic for both leads was compelling, if slightly short-changed for space. It reminded me a great deal of some of the movies you see on Lifetime or similar tv stations--decent, but a little slow for my taste."
4,Delightful piece of fluff,"This book is light and easy reading. Very predictable all the way, there are no surprise twists or plot turns, but it's one of the better lesbian books I've read in a while. I prefer this one to her other book ""Love In The Balance""."
3,a look at the trials of love... or perhaps just a depressing read.,"Some may find this book uplifting by taking a look at the trials of life and love that our characters face head on. I found it depressing. I liked the characters, and i have no problem with the author's writing stile, but the story was more focused on the unhappy reality of the icky politics and bullying and discrimination that i work so hard to avoid; and doesn't spend enough time on developing and letting us spend time with these great characters and their happy moments.i try to predict the outcome of all books that i read, while i'm reading them. This one had me knowing the entire time, that there was no possible way it could end well, unless the author gave us an unrealistic happy ending that wouldn't be believable. i wont tell you which one you get in the end, but as i suspected ... your only options in this book were depressing reality, or fairy tale happy ending. either way it wasn't an entertaining book for me."
3,A great romance,"Shayna is a biracial attorney whose professional drive destroys every relationship she has. Her best friend Jean is a dedicated teacher whose marriage is crumbling. As Shayna realizes the depth of her feelings for Jean, she tries hard to not let them influence her actions, and she never imagines that the feelings could be reciprocated. After divorcing her husband, Jean has an epiphany about her life and her past, and discovers her attraction for Shayna, but can she change her attitudes and life to let this love exist? Marianne Martin's deligthful romance also features some challenging issues like race, and harassment in school systems, that enhance the burgeoning love story. Like most romance fiction, ""Mirrors"" skims the surface and doesn't delve too deeply or painfully into the characters's pasts, but instead the focus is on the love story of the two women. It's a well-written and lovely story that is sure to appeal to all readers of lesbian romance stories."
3,Vague...,"I really felt that this book had a lot of potential, but everything happened quickly and didn't give the reader any opportunity to feel what the characters were feeling, nor did it allow for any real connection to any of the characters. For example, the two characters get together, split up, and get back together in a very unrealistic, rushed, timeframe. All of the issues explored in this story were interesting and were easy to relate to, but never really got off the ground because the author seemed in a rush to end the book. Even the conclusion was somewhat unsatisfying. I much prefer the writing of Lori Lake, and perhaps I've just gotten use to reading a more drawn-out story that keeps me turning the pages, and always satisfies at the end. I did enjoy ""Love In The Balance"" and would recommend it above this book."
4,A well balanced tape on parrots,"Being accustomed to watching ""Nature"" on my local PBS channel, and listening the marvelous voice of George Paige (who in my opinion has the perfect voice for nature narration), this will not disappoint those that have the high standards that ""Nature"" brings. This shows all sides of Parrots and is quite informative and captivating to watch both the wild and pet parrots. I am especially happy that Dr. Irene Pepperberg's hard work has made it into this video. She has been tireless in her 20 years of hard work and has proven that african grey parrots are as intelligent as dolphins and chimpanzees. If you have a grey, you must get a copy of her book AND videotape entitled ""Teaching Your African Grey The Alex Way."" I rate that video five-plus stars."
5,My favorite bird video,This video is very entertaining. One can not ever get tired of watching it. I have seen it about 5 times now and keep finding new and interesting pieces in the video. I showed it at one of my bird club meeting and everyone just loved it. There are not many bird videos out there and this one makes up for that. In this video you get to see how intelligent and beautiful the birds are. I hope everyone buys and enjoys this as much as I have.
4,"Very cute, but smaller than thought",This is a very sweet and cute ornament. When it arrived it was a little smaller than I was thinking it would be but I must not have looked carefully at the dimensions. It is still a very adorable ornament for anyone who likes Shibas.
5,An excellant book that can touch areas across curriculum.,"This is an excellent book. I have used it for medieval, folk/fairy tale, multiplication, critical thinking, and role playing studies. It is also just a wonderful story for read aloud at home or school. The illustrations are just beautiful."
4,Gotta love fairy tales,"I remember this book from middle school. I told people the story, and everyone thought I made it up! I'm glad to see that it's in print, and not just a figment of my imagination. If you love fairy tales, you'll like this book. A little strange, but worth the read."
5,wonderful artwork adds to a great tale,"This is an enchanting story made more so by wonderfully fresh watercolor artwork. The different perspectives used by the artist adds to the uniqueness of the tale. The color, compositions, poses, and facial expressions make this a great visual story as well. And Melisande's hair looks great no matter what length it is."
5,Wonderful Writing,"Many academics can't write. That's a fact. But Prof. Kim is marvelous at writing. His writing is understandable, clear, lucid, and interesting. I liked the content of his writing as well. But for me, I was particularly interested to see the clarity of his written form. This book is accessible even to non-specialists because Prof. Kim is such a lucid writer. Wnen you read this book, you'll see what I mean."
5,Excellent Book!,"I became interested in Prof. Kim's books after being exposed to them in the library of the Hong Kong Baptist University. I read his book, Jewish Law and Identity: Academic Essays, with great interest. I am glad that I was able to purchase this book and read it (I couldn't wait for the book to be catalogued at the library). I highly recommend this book. It's an excellent book of scholarship!"
1,coincidences,"It is a singular coincidence that most all of the multiple positive ""reviewers"" of Mr. Kim's books sound all very similar and only review HIS books. One wonders how easy it would be to get positive ratings through one person creating multiple reviews under various aliases...It also coincidental that one of Mr. Kim's books was the first book to be published by Hermit Kingdom press... One wonders about the ""scholarly"" nature of non-peer-reviewed writing..."
1,Terrible book written by a racist sex pest,Once again Christian Kim has produced a abominable book based upon his lewd sexual fantasies. It is clear from reading this drivel that Christian Kim cares as much about womens rights as the American's do about killing innocent Iraqi and Afghan civilians in the war on 'terror'. Christian Kim's use of English is appalling and many of his arguments fail to make sense as a result. I would steer well clear of this book if you're looking for a serious treatise on womens rights.Asif
1,Women's rights you're having a laugh!,I agree completely with Danielle; this book is totally ridiculous given that it were written by well known 'sex pest'. What does Christian Kim know about women's rights? Does a woman have the right not to be touched up by Christian Kim? The hypocrisy of Christian Kim never ceases to amaze me and this book is a stunning example. I do hope that Christian will stop writing these god awful books and get a job.
1,What a Cheek!,I cannot believe that Christian Kim has the audacity to write a book on women's rights when he has a reputation for infringing those rights in the worst possible manner i.e. sexual harassment. It is important to note that the topic of sexual harassment and a girls right not to be subjected to it are not covered in this book; I wonder why? Could have something to do with Christian's activities in Cambridge?Avoid this ridiculous book written by a hypocrite!
1,Racist drivel!,"This is one of the worst books I've ever had the mis-fortune to read; it is poorly written and the material offensive. Racist, religious and gender stereotypes are present throughout the book. The arguments made by Kim are poorly constructed and based on the most dubious evidence imaginable. When historical facts do not support Kim's argument, he simply distorts the truth to make it fit in with his story. I would advise all prospective readers to avoid this sham of a book dressed up as academic research."
1,Coincidences (pt. 2),"Once again, it is a singular coincidence that most all of the multiple positive ""reviewers"" of Mr. Kim's books sound all very similar and only review HIS books. One wonders how easy it would be to get positive ratings through one person creating multiple reviews under various aliases...It also coincidental that one of Mr. Kim's books was the first book to be published by Hermit Kingdom press... One wonders about the ""scholarly"" nature of non-peer-reviewed writing..."
5,Great for use outdoors!,"We ordered two different styles of these, wine and champagne and they are perfect for use in our summer camp! Pretty and practical too."
5,Edward G. Robinson Marathon,Edward G. Robinson spectaular feaures over 3 hours of this great actor in his prime. Real film noir with dark themes and heavy drama! The Stranger has the added bonus of being directed by the legendary director Orson Welles.
4,Kodak CX7430,"Although it lacks a German lens, this unit provided crisp clear close-ups. Very easy to use for the most part. Display is bright and menu commands are logically arranged."
2,Had my camera since 2005,"When i got this camera it was terrific, I bought the batteries with it. They last about 2.5 years and suddenly no longer would keep a charge. So i went and bought a new set of batteries same thing. I'll put a fresh set of batteries in straight off the charger and the camera tells me they batteries are almost dead. Yet when i put the batteries in a game controller or anything else after charging them, they are perfectly fine. Will NOT buy another Kodak. In fact, I'm waiting on my Canon Rebel to get here. It got me through but won't buy another one."
1,Broke after 15 days and only used twice,"Good out of the bad. After so much reading I got my CX7430. The second time I went to use it, it turned on and never work again. The lense extended and did nothing else after that. The good part of the story is that I took it back to the Kodak dealer here in Panama City, Panama and within two days a I got not just a replacement but the step up model DX7440 for no extra money. Not much to say about the CX7430, but a big round of applause for the dealership here in Panama"
2,Poorest images in 4MP class...,"This camera gives images great color depth BUT images are of poor quality with respect to noise, artifacting, and being grainy. Also, the camera has a VERY slow shutter! Don't count on ever getting a child's smile with this one. In addition, the camera uses up a set of batteries within ~40 shots! (even with the LCD viewer turned off!)"
3,"Pictures are a mixed bag, but still a good buy","Pros:- Great price for an outstanding 4MP resolution- Small and light- Easy-to-use menus; lots of dedicated function buttons- Video with sound that's worth keeping!- Portraits generally look outstandingCons:- Can't remember your flash setting after turning off camera- Images generally overexposed- Trouble taking pictures when zoomed inThis is a great camera for the price, yet images can turn out anywhere from outstanding to poor. Portraits usually look great, with soft, smooth skin tones. But most images, taken with or without the flash, are highly overexposed. And when zoomed in (using the optical zoom, not digital), all the pictures turn out blurry. This happens even in well-lit conditions and when I am holding the camera still.If you are not terribly concerned about the quality of your pictures, this is an excellent camera. But since I've found that my old 2MP Fuji camera takes better (if grainier) pictures, I'm not likely to shop at Kodak again."
3,worked only twice,"This camera was good for the price but has the last owner's albums, and they can't be deleted, which is funny.I got to use it twice before it broke."
2,OK while it lasted,"This was an OK camera and did basically what it was supposed to do. Found the battery pack didn't last very long and the dock setup bulky. The camera itself was functional, although not terribly responsive. I owned it about 2.5 years and got about 2 years of reliable use. Doesn't seem that great a deal over the long haul."
5,Great Camera,"I've had this camera for about 3 yrs now, and it's never given me a single problem. It takes very good pictures of scenery, but I don't think the night vision mode is particularly great (are any cameras that good @ taking shots in the dark though?). I've never regretted purchasing this camera."
2,Camera = good; Software = horrible,"I've had no problems with the camera itself, but the necessary Kodak software is so horrible, that it makes me avoid the camera too. The software makes it difficult to download select photos versus the entire collection on the camera. It also has skimpy editing features. I have to jump around from the Kodak software to a microsoft one and then another from a different website in order to get all the different changes I want in a picture."
1,very bad coustomer servise on junk,"I have never been a big fan of company's that have moved there coustomer servise overseas . I paid high dollar for this item with the dock and printer .after a short period of time I started having problems with the camera , of course it was out of warrenty . I will never purchase Kodak again . Poor picture quality ."
2,severely underpowered flash,"I nioted a couple of people commenting on the poor flash and then a a person upbraiding those persons for expecting too much.I have been working with cameras for about 30 years and digitals for 12 years since we had one of the early models at our our newspaper.I have used quite anumbe rof the $150 to $250 range small digitals like the 7340 and bought a 7340 for my daughter over christmas. I have to say for the price range this camera has a very poor flash. It is not just a bit underpowered but markedly so compared to this size and price range digital. when I noted how bad the flash was we compared identical indoor shot with four cameras, the 7430, a canon, an olympus and a sony all in the under $200 range of this camera.we are keeping the camera, the optics and several other elements make it a decent camera, but there is NO question this camera has a very underpowered flash.the software is also pretty cumbersome compared to other software in the class as well."
2,great at first,"I recieved this as a gift a couple years ago and used it off and on up until about six months ago when I went to use it and it refused to work properly. The paper kept getting jammed and once I'd fix the jam and try with another sheet, it did it again! I'm done trying to make it work, because it's way too much of a hassle. I wouldn't recommend it if you're hoping to use it for a lot of pictures and for a longer time period than a year or so."
2,Disposable Camera?,"WE bought this camera 2 years ago and were satisfied until recently. Of course the camera stops working properly when you most need it. It started giving really dark photos the day our son was born. Now we have all of these horrible, dark pictures of the birth of our son. We have tried to get it serviced but every shop we take it to says that we need to mail it to kodak and that it will cost at least $150 to fix it. I didn't realize I had bought a disposable camera. I am really diappointed."
1,I WAS A SUCKA!!!!,THIS PRODUCT SUCKED. I TAKE A PICTURE AND THEY ALL COME OUT DARK. THE OWNER SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT. I GUESS I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR. THEY WON'T LIGHTEN UP NO MATTER WHAT I DO TO THEM. I WAS A SUCKA.
3,understand flash,"At least one of the problems described by the commentator above may be due to user error. I am regularly amazed by people who try to use a flash to capture people on stage 50 feet away (or even use flash to attempt to take a picture of a projected film on a screen). The tiny flashes on ALL portable cameras only work up to about 15 feet away (and if they are close enough to a film screen they'll just wipe it out with white light).So, we shouldn't be surprised that your flash pictures of your cousin turned out dark -- the flash didn't reach him. And, we shouldn't be surrpised that it was blurry -- when zoomed in, in low light, any autofocus will have trouble tracking and the CCD will barely get enough light to register anything.(I don't have this particular camera so just gave it a middling rating out of ignorance.)"
2,Only lasts 6 months,"I was given this camera as a going away gift when I moved to brazil one year ago. The camera was fine for about 6 months. It has not been exposed to any harsh elements or dropped. I did not use anything but Kodak recommended american bought batteries. But in the summer the camera just died...I replaced the batteries with brand new ones a few times (even batteries Kodak recommended) but the camera will not turn on. Now I have a camera that DOES NOT HAVE POWER and no longer works. I even still have pictures in the camera! I contacted the company and the best Kodak can offer me is service which costs more than to buy a camera of the same quality. Overall I am quite disappointed, with the camera and Kodak company."
5,A really good digital camera,"I love this camera, however, the best time to take pictures is during the day with light. The night pictures are pretty dark, but you can still see them. The camera also only takes 2 AA batteries, which makes the camera pretty light.Overall this is a very good digital camera for the price."
5,a lot of camera for the price,"I've had this camera for about a year now, and I love it.It's my first digital and I'm amazed at all it can do. It has all the features I could ever want. I just take photos of family get-togethers.After a few months I discovered how to take videos and they are a lark!I paid around $170 for it a year ago and it's a great camera for that price."
3,Kodak CX7430-No Longevity,"I have owned two of this particular camera. I am now on my third. I originally bought my first one, years ago at Sam's Wholesale Club when it first came out.It takes great photos, for a novice point and shoot person.However, when I went to change the batteries on the first camera that I bought, the battery cover fell apart. I contacted Kodak to have it repaired but it would have been too costly, more than what I paid for the camera. I then bought another, online, at Amazon.com. It arrived and I used it for one year and then that one too, failed. I now have bought another,online, used but ""like new"". The camera arrived yesterday and I am using it to take photos of our ""NEMO"" Blizzard 2013 and it seems to be taking photos in good order. I am hoping this one will last, for more than a year."
4,I Love This Camera!,"I like this camera so much, I bought a used one after mine broke after it was dropped. The CX7430 was the first digital camera I bought (my 35mm died right before vacation in 2003 and I needed an easy-to-use point-and-shoot). This camera fit the bill....it's easy to use and takes great pictures. The only issues I've encountered are: (1) battery life is short (but increases if you turn off the LCD screen and use the viewfinder) (2) camera often ""freezes up"" and won't open in cold weather."
2,a piece of junk,"I bought this scale because I wanted an accurate scale to replace my current analog one. For my disappointment, it only works in extremely perfect flat surfaces. It gives random reading otherwise. Sometimes the reading is off by as much as 50 pounds. I got it like a month ago and I'm already looking to buy a different one."
1,Taylor 7507 Make-Believe Scale - Product Review,"This is an attractive looking product, but hardly a reliable one. For example, it has overestimated my weight and my wife's from the beginning every time we've used it. A specific example of its ridiculous performance is that one day: (a) I weighed myself in the buff, (b) got off the scale and immediately urinated copiously (in the toilet), (c) then immediately got back on the scale, still in the buff, and the scale showed my weight had gone UP half a pound! So if you're looking for an decorative object whose maker claims it will display your weight but never does so properly and serves best as a way to waste some floor space, this is the product for you! I think someone should report Taylor to the BBB for abusive and misleading business practices."
2,"Nice Bathroom Deco Item, but that's it!","Bought this cause it looks nice and was on sale. Probably on sale because it's not accurate and can't be adjusted. I have not had the widely varying readings as some people have but it is consistently off about 1.5-2 lbs on the low end and as much as 6 lbs on the mid range. Hard to believe there is no adjustment. I'm taking it back for a refund and going back to my accurate ""Chancellor"" mechanical scale. It's 30 years old and a little ugly but very accurate."
2,Carl,This is a beautiful piece of decoration in my bath room. The scale is really not accurate at all.You stepped on the scale in sucession you will get TWO totally different numbers. Sad but true.
1,Accuracy does not match what they say,"Ok, I was expecting 0.2 lb of error. But the scale is off by AT LEAST 2 lb (and up to 5 lb!) when compared to cheap scales (and I compared to some 4 different scales). They say that the accuracy is +/- 0.2 lb, but I guess one can only achieve that on a perfect surface, which is almost never the case. This is what they do not say in the product description. And there is not an adjustment in the scale to correct this offset, so one can only hope that the scale comes calibrated from the factory. I will call Taylor to see what they have to say. Not to say that I did not say something nice, it is a beautiful scale."
2,Taylor 7507 scale,I was disappointed with this scale because it varied 2-3 lbs routinely when compared with an upright balance type scale as found in doctor's offices. This was done wearing the same clothing and at the same time over many days. I would not recommend it. Kathy Ales
4,Best Singaporean author. Don't believe the rest,"I've been reading and re-reading Colin Cheong's novels and stories for the past ten years, and I love his books. 'Seventeen' reaches out to students and ex-students who have been in junior colleges in Singapore. I read it about 8 or 9 years after leaving JC and it really brought back a lot of memories.Teenage angst? Real life? Well, it sounds much more realistic when Colin writes about it, rather than those stories in which other Singaporean authors have tried to potray Singapore still as a mythical place full of smoky Chinese temples and old superstitious women juxtaposed against a backdrop of the city skyline, concrete jungle and uncaring busy young executives.His characters, plot and places bring back memories, and even though no names are mentioned, you know what he's talking about.If you want to bring back memories of your JC days, read this book. You won't go wrong."
3,Quick Service,Condition of book just as stated. Especially pleased with no delay in filling my order.
3,Book arrived in worse condition than I expected.,The top corner of the book has been chewed by a dog. (or other large mammal!) The content inside the book is unharmed but I am disappointed with the condition. If I had known it would be so mangled I would have looked for a different copy.
5,Good Recipes,"Jamba Juice, I luv this place! (and the Jamba Juice recipes found in this book). I'm glad I found this book that made the summer of 2001 real tasty and cool. Luv the book, and recommend to all who luv smoothies!"
5,Good Clean Fun,We listened to these on a long road trip and it kept the entire family enchanted and amused. A really good value for what all is included.
1,Not shipped as promised,I ordered this item before T-giving as a Christmas present for my 88 year old mother. I never recieved it although my charge card was promptly charged. The seller did not respond to my email so I contacted Amazon's customer service who took care of it for me. I was to receive a refund (still waiting to see my charge card) then all of a sudden the tapes came on Dec. 28th. Not sure what this seller is doing! (I ordered a similar product from a differant seller & got it right away)
5,"Radio X Recording Stars, Superchargers' Debut Record","Why are you reading this? Don't you alreday have this record... hehummm... CD?You know Darrin (geetar) ""discovered"" the now famous DONNAS...and Fat Turd (bass player), started RipOff Records.Some chick, probably Your Mom, bangs on drums and screams on a few songs. This record hurts my ears and gives me a headache when I play it loud, but I can't seem to scrape it off of my turntable!WARNING:Although this record is a favorite of the crack smoking homeless type, you'll find high school age girls dig it too! They will think you are very sophisticated if you play them this cd and will probably want to have sex with you. So beware! Be prepared... use a condom! We don't need more idiots like this group of douchebags running around...."
2,good sound but not very durable. Earbuds are uncomfortable,"These headphones sound pretty nice, however, my first pair only lasted a couple weeks before it shorted out and my second pair only lasted a couple months or so. I tried the earbuds as well and did not like them at all. I do not like earbuds anyway, but these seem especially uncomfortable and they always feel like theyre falling out of my ears."
2,You get what you pay for,"Very cheap quality headphones. The ""Deep Bass"" written on the package is misleading because the speakers start tearing at high bass. So if you like music that has lots of bass, these are not the speakers for you. Also, the ear cushions do not fit on your head. The back region is always off my head so you lose the coverage and hence hear everything that goes around you. Unless you like hearing noises around you and not the music, get these. I returned these things right away, so don't waste time buying 'em."
4,Good sound,"Good transfer from analog tape to SACD: for the first time is possible to listen all the ""breath"" of this original recording. I love Beethoven's Karajan and I find this Pastorale a bit ""confused"", in comparison. The 5th is very good, instead. I am giving 4 stars more for technical results than for artistical results."
2,good for one use,It worked OK. I used it to stain my fence. It worked good for the first hour then it became sticky and did not spray even. I got my fence done and then through the unit away.
5,Low Fat Big Franks are Great,"I have had a hard time finding a vegie hot dog that I like. I have tried them all. I loved the Big Franks that were not low fat, but getting them was a problem. This is my first try of the low fat ones and I do think they are just as good, and now getting them is easy too."
5,Big Franks,"I have eaten Big Franks for years. They are lower in fat and more digestable than beef weiners. The flavor is pleasant, the texture is very meat-like. They are precooked so they can be warmed in the mocrowave for about 2 minutes for four franks. They are very versatile and can be carried without refrigerated if they have not been opened. Soy is the major ingredient and it is the only plant protien which is a complete protein by itself. Patricia Neely-Mississippi"
2,Not the same as regular Big Franks,"I grew up on Loma Linda products and was excited to see them available on Amazon. The bad news is that these low fat big franks are way different than the normal ones. I was excited to have my newly vegetarian girlfriend try them out, but then I was embarrassed because they weren't nearly as good. They actually made us both a little sick. They're just too dense and strange.Stick with the linketts or find normal big franks somewhere else. I don't think they are on Amazon."
3,OK....but the Big Franks and Linketts are MUCH better!,"I like eating these hot dogs grounded up with onions and salt. But frying and eating them just like that, does not taste so good like the original. In fact, I like the Big Franks and Linketts much better than this fat free version."
4,Best Hot Dog substitute,These are delicious in a Hot Dog bun. they are a good size and don't fall apart when cooking. i've tried other veggie sausages but these are the best.
2,classy goth type stuff.,"the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of ""classic"". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic ""club"" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past.."
5,Good stuff,"Out of all the ways there are to quit smoking, I think this is a good one. Initially it might be a bit much so as you go along you might want to start cutting the patches in 2 and applying them once in the morning and once in the arvo. After two weeks you might be able to make it with just 1/2 a patch a day."
3,Worth the price,"Good book with a lot of information that is still pertinent, but also a lot of information that is outdated."
1,Product insuficcint,Product does not discuss theory and operation of AC systems .. It's meant for someone who read other books and could use this guide as a review
3,"Not perfect, but convenient","I have a number of Spanish Dictionaries and CDs for learning Spanish. I travel to Mexico about once every year or two. Unfortunately, I never make the time commitment to really refresh my knowledge of the language. I throw my copy of the Berlitz Latin American Spanish into my backpack and browse through it on the flight down. It helps. The book is small; I keep it handy throughout the trip and refer to it often.Everyone has different ways to learn a language or to use a language book. There are a number of ways this one could be improved, but it's simple - and easy to carry - and that counts for something."
2,Less than meets the eye,"Ambitious book with a high theory profile. Should be read by people interested in the ""queer Renaissance"" but promises more than it delivers."
3,Not the best copy,"As far as the Bible goes...there is no better book! But as far as this printing goes...it leaves room for improvement.The type is of a lower quality and has a smudged effect in some places. The text is a little hard to read. And the roman numerals are quite useless, (for someone who hasn't had a math class in 15 years).I have a HUGE master reference study Bible that I was hoping to use this one as a substitute and less of a physical work out, LOL. But it really hasn't been all that usefull to me as a study Bible. Perfect size for carrying around though.The feel of the Bible is good, and it lays nice while reading it. But since it is the Bible I just feel better reading from something with a higher quality. Now with that said...this is about the cheapest version out there, how picky can one be without spending a few bucks."
4,A nice set of speakers for the price,"One of the front door speakers in my 99 Chevy Silverado was blown, so I bought a set of the Dual DS653's to add new life to my ailing stereo. The stereo in the truck is the original factory unit, and I wasn't really looking for any big improvement in performance, so I didn't have any expectations going into this. I picked the DS653's mainly because they seemed like one of the better deals out there, and Dual is a well recognized name in audio. After installing the speakers I cranked up the tunes and found myself pleasantly surprised. The DS653's have good solid bass (at least as solid as one can expect from a 6 1/2"" speaker) and clear detailed highs thanks to the dome tweeters. Overall the lows and highs are cleaner and more detailed than the factory stock speakers, with less muddiness in the mid-range. If you're looking for a budget minded speaker replacement and/or upgrade, then the DS653s should do well for you."
3,Good Outline/Reference regarding issues to watch for,"I was a little surprised at the sparsity of this book. In general, each set of two pages takes up 1 1/2 pages of actual text. However, the ideas are valuable, and as far as I'm concerned the chapter on political pitfalls by itself justified the purchase price. I would recommend browsing through it in the bookstore first, then making your purchasing decision."
4,The Signs & Rhymes of Burma Shave,"Growing up I would see the Burma Shave signs along the Mother Road, viewing the history of the company was wonderful. This added to my collection of tapes & Dvd's about the Mother Road, Route 66."
1,Photo / Description Disparity,"Item pictured is NOT the same as item listed in description. Norpro model 3772 (listed in description) is much larger overall (as opposed to pictured pan) due to significantly wider brims as well as bulky handles on each end. Additionally, rim of pan is rolled UP as opposed to under. And finally, while pictured item appears to be stainless steel or aluminum, model 3772 is made of tin. Buyer beware. You can see a photo of the actual item by visiting the Norpro website."
4,Great for beginners,"I'm 25 years old and in the last year and half I've put on 40 lbs (yikes) well I figured it was time to start working out and this tape was the first one I purchased. I did it for a month straight and I was really happy with how it helped get me back on track, however, I would not consider it a ""fat burning"" workout, it's more of a tape to get you limbered up for more advance workouts."
4,"Challenging, but not daunting, for a moderate exerciser.","Exercise starts out slowly, builds to a point where you are working up a sweat and then gradually comes back down again without a prolonged period of maximum effort. Short sets of light aerobics are alternated with sets of toning exercises, some using free weights, a tall box, (I use my two-step Rubbermaid footstool) and a dowel. (I use an expandable shower curtain rod.)You can improvise equipment based on what you have around your house. There are lots of squats, lunges and dips so quads and hamstrings get the most toning benefits. The last exercise on the tape is a great shaper for the upper hamstring area. Exercises are done in low-rep sets so they are mangageable and the tape moves along quickly. I like the tape and have recommended it to my sister (who has been doing the same Jane Fonda tape for more than 5 years!)"
1,No beginner,"This is NOT for beginners. They are way too quick to be able to follow. Yet I can follow other videos without problem. If you're a beginner, get either another of the Firm ""Basics"": Abs, Buns & Thighs Workout. Or you can also try Cardio for Beginners with Petra Kolber--both titles available at Amazon, by the way."
1,I could have saved $50 and made my own with elastic and velcro,"Now I know why, for all these years, I hesitated to buy something to train my shoulders. Because it just doesn't work!The velcro areas are sharp and scratchy (and yes, I DID have them facing away from my body). The claim that it is 'invisible under your clothes' is just not true - unless you wear gunny sacks every day.If it had some sort of stays or support within the garment it may have been more effective, but this had nothing except straps. PLUS, there is no option to return the item if unsatisfied.Duped, once again, by good advertising. Call me gullible..."
3,okay?,"This was okay. I only wore it a few times because it cut into my armpits. Someone suggested a t-shirt under it, I tried that but it still was tight on my pits and didn't seem too effective at pulling my shoulders back."
1,"save your money, it will break","I am very unhappy with this product. In fact, I may go as far as to say this might be the biggest waste of money in my shopping history. It worked for about three days then the time was consistently off and then the laser stopped working all together, and it became nothing more than an overpriced piece of junk pen. Me and my friend exchanged gifts. I bought him what I thought was a nice pen. He bought me a nice zippo. Now I feel like a jerk for getting ripped off. Do yourself a favor. Don't waste your money on this pen. By a zippo instead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Nothing original,","It's a really bad movie. The action takes place in the 50's but the music is from the present times. The whole movie looks like a video clip from Santana or Ricky Martin. It's a poor copy of the original Dirty Dancing - follows the same pattern : they meet, dance together, and have a spectacular final dance.From this movie it looks like the people from Havana danced everyday, everywhere and didn't mind that there was a revolution taking place.Boring, boring, boring."
3,"Dirty Dancing, the sequel.","This movie was just okay to me. I wasn't as interested in this one as I was the first. Granted, the cast was easy on the eyes in this film, but it just lacked the excellence of the first. To me, there is no touching a classic, so I guess that is to be expected. The second usually isn't as good as the first, that is the case here. I would suggest renting this, it's worth at least a watch. Patrick Swayze is back in this one, a small part."
4,pleasently surprised,I loved the original dirty dancing and didn't think a sequal would be as good but I was pleasently surprised. This movie actually has more story to it than the original and the dancing is even hotter. If you love dancing movies you will love this.
5,Hot Dancing in Havana,"I recently viewed the DVD Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and thought it was terrific! The dancing was extraordinary and the actors really made the scenes they were in come to life. I also thought it was a perk to have Patrick Swayze from the original movie,Dirty Dancing as a dance instructor in the movie. It is a must see movie and a must have in your DVD collection. The music was also sensational!"
5,better than the first!!!!,"as a die hard dirty dancing fan i was relucant to even watch this film. i finally gave in to persistant whines from my teenage daughter and that was it i was totally hooked!there isn't one scene in this movie i would even think of fast forwarding.i loved everything about it, the dancing, the hot soundtrack, the love story and best of all... diego luna!!where has mexico been hiding him. the film was worth it for him alone.watch the movie then buy the hot soundtrack. you won't be disappointed."
3,"A good dog, but still a dog","Was it lack of money?I believe the producers could have hired professional dancers for the title roles. They did so for the background and it was great.So what's lacking is professionalism.The actors do a creditable job, their dancing is OK without adding anything. The story is ho-hum, with a little unobtrussive mention of the Batista regime and Fidel Castro but with no specifics.All in all, as I said, a good dog.3 stars for trying. 0 for lack of success."
2,Way too familiar!,"If you saw the first Dirty Dancing, don't even bother watching this one!! The only difference is the people & the place. It was VERY predictable!!"
1,Maybe I am just too old?,"I loved the original Dirty Dancing, and loved rewatching it this year. Maybe I am just too old now to find anything tantalizing about an adolescent boy trying to be sensual, but it didn't work for me. The dancing was weak, even when extras were in the forefront. It was obvious that the parents of the leads were never the fabulous dancers they were made out to be. The plot borrowed so heavily from the original, that it just makes sense to watch the original instead!"
3,Fluffy but fun,"The dancing wasn't impressive and the story wasn't complex or deep. If you can enjoy simple ""boy meets girl"" stories or enjoy watching people dance then you will probably enjoy seeing this movie once (but I doubt twice). I would recommend renting instead of buying."
3,Bland but entertaining.,"There are lots of things in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights that I just did not like. The story was utterly predictable and dry. The characters weren't fleshed out enough. The songs were modern when the film took place in the 50s. It was too short and ended very quickly. And the dancing wasn't dirty. That said, there was also alot that attracted me to the film. The cast was great and the setting was beautiful. While the story was boring, it had charm. After the movie, I viewed the deleted scenes and realized that had they not been taken out, most of my complaints wouldn't exist. I hate when a movie is ruined because of test audience opinions. The deleted scenes in this case should have stayed because they added to the story rather than subtracted from it. Had that been the case, we would have had a much better movie. But I guess Havana Nights was good enough. It was 85 minutes of entertainment, nothing more. But it sure was fun."
1,One of the worst movie of 2004,"DDHN is a totally miserable movie to watch. The story is flaccid and all too predictable, and the use of the Cuban Revolution in the background is forced, awkward and unbelievable. It's just ridiculous to cast Luna in the role of a budding underground revolutionary. The ending, with the two puppy lovers making love and then gleefully saying goodbye, is a total insult to the audience.Ok, so we probably didn't watch the movie for the silly plot or the unbalanced romance. But unlike the original Dirty Dancing, which had good acting and good dancing to make it into a classic, this one lacks these sorely, too. Nobody in this movie can really act, and the dancing feels empty and falls short of my modest expectations. Where's the energy? Where's the rhythm? Where's the art? None of those. The two leading actors are just too young to be taken seriously in any way.In short, DDHN is one of those terrible movies that should not have been made."
3,Okay to watch!,"I found the movie to be full of color and music, however I found it to be weak. The ending was a great disappointment. What I didn't understand was, why was it taking place in the 50's when the music was out of place. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the music but it didn't seem to go with the movie. I thought the movie had great potential and could've been better.I think it is important when going to see this movie not to compare to the Original Dirty Dancing. This is not the same movie!"
2,"Lame, lame, lame","I was really hoping to enjoy this movie, really, I was. It was just so lame. The acting WAS horrible...it seemed forced among all actors. Their was NO chemistry between the main characters. Even the cameo with Patrick Swayze was ridiculous! He had no spirit in him. It was almost as if the writers wanted him to bring (tie in) these movies together. Ugh..maybe you should see it just to say you did, but rent it first before wasting your money on poor acting.BTW, if you are seeing it to see Swayze, he LOOKS horrible. His face lift makes him look, well, fake. It's just a bit too tight. He was extremely ""fine"" in the original DD."
2,Boring!,"Poor imitation of the original. I quite liked the first Dirty Dancing but this doesn't even compare. Story is pretty boring and unless you are a teenage girl, this won't interest you much. Add the leading man who is a skinny kid and looks about 12, and the usual chanting of ""Revolution-good! Capitalism-bad!"" and you have the recepe for a something you don't want to bother with."
3,Romanticizing a Failed Revolution,"The dancing was good but they could have had more of it. The love story was barely warm. Romanticizing a failed revolution which continues to commit human rights violations against it's own people is really sad, even for a fantasy film. Batista was bad but Castro has been way worse. THE ENDING WAS TOTALLY DISHONEST IN A HISTORICAL SENSE, AS CASTRO'S REVOLUTION HAS DONE NOTHING BUT ENSLAVE, KILL & TORTURE THE CUBAN PEOPLE. If you can set aside the dishonesty & illogical romanticizing of the failed revolution, the film is just ok. The original Dirty Dancing was WAY BETTER."
4,Better than the first one!,"I sincerely thing that this movie is WAY better than the first one. I tried to watch the first one, and I was just bored throughout the first 20 minutes I could get through. Now, for Havana Nights, I know the plot isn't very well written and the script has some pretty corny dialogue, but the dancing makes up for it big time. I love the sensual feel of this movie, and it could partly be because I'm Hispanic and LOVE the way Hispanic's dance. Diego and Romola have amazing chemistry, overall, I think that it's a great film that makes you want to dance once you finish watching it."
4,very late delivery... but good product and cooperative company,"The movie was in very good condition, shrink-wrapped and good as new. But I didn't get it until a month after my order. I believe they had actually mailed one out two days after my order but it got lost in the mail. I emailed them and they simply sent me another one and it was here in two days. At first I was very angry that my order took so long to come in. But in retrospect, it was not the company's (aokmovie's) fault."
4,Almost as good as the first!,"As a diehard romantic, this movie has been put on one of the top romantic movies. It's fun, energetic, it really gets you in mood. Personally, after seeing that movie, I just wanna move to Cuba lol.It's just a fun movie and you can really the chemistry between these two individuals.It's not as good as the first. I mean the first one was a classic, we all know that. Usually nothing can beat the first movie, but this one is almost as good as it. I really don't know why Patrick Swayze made an appearance? I mean it was nice seeing him in it, but it just seemed pointless.Anyway, good movie - you'll like it ;)"
4,Better than the first!,This movie was great mainly because of the sensuality. Dirty dancing-1987 wasn't really as sensual as the Spanish version. Havana nights shows the tango's style and sexuality. You have to be close with another person and experience it together. I would reccomend it to people who like Latin dance or love stories even predictable ones. Even though it's a boy meets girl story it can be pretty unpredictable at parts. This is mainly because it was an uneasy time in Cuba. 4 stars.
5,Better than the Original,"OMG this movie is a definite must see!! While the first Dirty Dancing was undeniably a classic this movie just has something more. You just can't take your eyes off the screen as they dance because it's so amazing!! The story is interesting and sweet, and Diego Luna as Javier is just brilliant. Please give this movie a chance!!!:-)"
2,great for after baby,This is the tape I used to tone up after having my baby. Ten minutes fly by and I saw results fast! It really worked for me!
4,Pretty good,"Some people shy from Denise's videos because they hate her perkiness. But where she loses points in uppeti-ness, she compensates for in a pretty good workout.I think she's a pretty motivating teacher, and does a good job of instructing in this video. But her exercises aren't as good as those in Tamilee Webb's Abs of Steel.I switched over to Abs of Steel, and find myself more challenged and building a much firmer midsection with that program.But Hit the Spot Abs is good for a beginner."
5,An excellent video you can do every day!,"Denise is an excelllent motivator and fun to work out with. This video is great to begin every day with since each segment is only 10 minutes, but they work you hard!!"
3,Just so-so,"This video is all right, but if you have been working your abs regularly for some time now, you probably will not feel ANYTHING after doing one 10-minute work out. You might be sore after 2 10-minute workouts. However, if you do abs properly and challenge yourself, 10 minutes should be enough, so I was disappointed."
1,Racist Agenda,greeks are known for racism throughout Europe. And this dvd is an example of greek chauvinism propaganda.
4,Excellent addition to the series of plot summaries.,I got the British edition at a convention and the book is well-worth waiting for. It ties up the five-year story arc and fills in some details of each story with plenty of back plotting and insights into the actors in each story.
1,Had to throw it away....didn't even both to clean it.,"Worse thing I ever bought on Amazon, never worked the right way. It did heat up but the chocolate never flowed up as it shows on the box or claims it doesn't. Would be great if Amamzon returned my money.If I knew I would have never bought it."
2,can't get it to work,Love the way this fountain looks and the noise level is great but I can't get it to work right.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!,"I have NEVER been disappointed in a purchase from Amazon before. This was my second chocolate fountain, as I wanted one for milk chocolate and one for white chocolate for a party in early November. This does Not warm enough, and even when I had the chocolate warmer, the machine would not circulate the chocolate. IT was a disaster!! Decided to give it another try in December, again a failure!! Then I tried just circulating cooking oil, it wouldn't even do that. This is a total peice of junk, and I would send it back, but it is too late. I have a cheaper smaller version of a different name, it works everytime and perfectly, so I know how to use the appliance, this one is just not working. DO NOT PURcHASE!!!"
4,Works well,"The fountain is easy to assemble, is quiet and just the right size, however I have not yet been able to get the perfect flow. The Sephra chocolate is difficult to purchase in Canada for a reasonable price. There is also some waste when cleaning."
4,Chocolate **NOT** Included,"Shipping was lightning fast!! The fountain is lovely, but I have not had an opportunity to test it because, as others have stated, this model does not come with chocolate, (despite the claim to the contrary in the item description). In fact, the box it comes in clearly states on it: ""Chocolate Not Included."" Apparently one reviewer was lucky enough to receive chocolate with his order, but based on the recent reviews, there is only a one in four chance that yours will. It's not worth returning the fountain, but if your decision to buy this product is based on the chocolate being included- you will likely be disappointed when it arrives. Still a great bargain as compared to department store pricing!!!"
2,WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING ELSE,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD, THAT IT IS GOOD. WHEN YOU ARE TIRED AND DO NOT FEEL LIKE GOING THROUGH YOUR LIBRARY OF DVD'S, PULL THIS ONE OUT OF THE FRONT. THE ACTING WAS ACCEPTABLE, BUT THE GIANT AND THE LAKE MONSTER WERE AKIN TO THE HAND PUPPETS USED IN THE OLD GODZILLA/KING KONG MOVIES. THERE WAS NO STORY LINE. VINCE VAN PATTEN IS ONE OF THOSE ACTORS WHO SHOULD HAVE HAD A BETTER CAREER. THE WOMEN IN THIS MOVIE WERE DECENT ACTORS, BUT 100% EYE CANDY. I THINK THE GIRLS WITH THE BIGGER BOOBS GOT HIRED FOR THIS CAMPY LAUGH FEST. ALL OF THE FIGHT SCENES COULD HAVE BEEN LONGER AND MORE VIOLENT. ALL IN ALL, NOT A GOOD MOVIE, BUT WORTH AN OCCASIONAL VIEWING."
1,A Campy Mess,"Where to begin with this one? As dopey and incomprehensible a film as you can imagine, ""Camp Fear"" somehow mixes a plot that involves Druids, Betsy Russell, the Loch Ness Monster (!), sadistic motorcycle gangs, sinister Indians, sorority girls, earthquakes, the Lambada dance craze and woeful acting into an unintelligable disaster. Never funny or thrilling, the film limps along from one cheesy scenario to another with little sense. Previously released on VHS in an oscure version called ""The Millennium Countdown"" (yes, the millennium figures into the ""plot""...how, I haven't quite figured out yet) and was believed to be the mysterious sequel to the film ""Cheerleader Camp"" (which also featured Russell), this film is not clever enough to be campy or engaging enough to be a cult hit. Don't say you weren't warned."
1,SO BAD IT'S GOOD!!!,"Possibly one of the worste movies I've ever seen!I could'nt stop smiling and laughing at this horrible mess, the acting, dialog, set pieces, everything sucks! But now that you know that, you can appriciate it for what it is, TOTAL CHEESE! ENJOY!"
5,A FEARED OF THE CAMP,"ONCE IN A WHILE A GOOFY MOVIE COMES ALONG, AN UNKNOWN THAT JUST MAKES YOU LAUGH, MAKES YOU GROAN AND MAKES YOU WONDER ""WHY'D THEY MAKE THIS.""HERE IT IS. NOT MEANT TO BE FUNNY BUT YOU HAVE TO LAUGH.WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING LIGHT AND AMUSING THIS IS IT."
2,Doesn't stay closed,"I received two of these for my baby shower and they are super cute, but they only closed completely a few times and now they will not stay closed, so the wipes dry out. I'm about to throw them out because I have to put the whole thing in a big zip lock, so what's the point? I hate writing bad reviews, but I would not recommend this product."
3,Just ok,It does the job but unlike most wipe boxes there is no hole to pull them out easily. You get what you pay for.
2,Wife liked it but I could't stand it,Hard to say why I didn't like it. It has a distinct smell besides the lemon smell that gives me a headache. I had to throw it away...just couldn't stand it.
2,The first two minutes,"Eric has released all of his creativity in the first two minutes and it was so impressive that I forced myself to sit through the remainder. I hope he reads this as a praise of the work he did in ""The Forest"". I was so excited when I watched ""The Forest"" that I watched it about ten times before continuing. When I did continue, I thought the next short film was from another film maker or maybe a bad joke. There was nothing else I would ever suggest anyone watch but the first two minutes. Please expound upon that in which you show talent."
1,fairly disappointed,"after reading the product description, i had pretty high expectations for this. let me just tell you, these shorts have nothing in common with jan svankmajer, the brothers quay, or tim burton. they're mostly long meandering shots of landscapes. each short feels as long as kubrick's 2001. i also bought eric leiser's feature, ""imagination"" and liked it quite a bit. i suggest anyone interested in him buy imagination instead."
5,Wonderful harmony with a historically and socially aware twist,"First, from the musical perspective, these guys are three excellent vocalists who make a brilliant harmony. They hit their notes and hold them dead steady. They are also very expressive. I am no expert on describing voice so I'll leave it at that.The subject matter is a mixture of old folk themes, modern interests, protest songs and traditional. Poaching, transportation, a setting of a Christmas Carol (the Dunston Carol/Hush my Babe) and so on.Several of the tracks on this album would have been worth the price on their own."
4,apology of tertullian,great source for christian apologetics from one of the earliest christian apologists. very insightful and thought provoking. its great that through todays technology we have greater access to such classics
4,nice analysis book to start with,"This is certainly the most intuitive Analysis book on the market. It is well written and the author presents the proofs in a way that should be accessable to most readers. He usually tries to use similiar proof techniques over and over again giving the student the practice he needs and seldom uses the rabbit in a hat style some other authors seem to prefer. Although these arguments make this book well suited for self-study, lack of solutions to the exercises is annoying for the ""home-learner"". As a text for a course the book is somewhat too cosy - given a lecture on a topic, you don't want to read 15 pages of anecdotes at home before the relevant theorems come up, at least that is my opinion. In any case this book offers a nice change of pace to the standard terse presentation of most Analysis books. For people with a backround in rudimentary Analysis who want some insights into Functional Analysis too, Rudins or Kolmogorov's books are probably the wiser choice."
3,"Very readable, but not a good book for reference","Actually sitting down and reading a math textbook is seldom very inviting, but The Way of Analysis is an exception to that--the exposition is very good, and Strichartz goes far to ensure that his readers don't get lost in a mass of formalism. That said, this sometimes makes the text seem rather disorganized, and definitions are only rarely set off from the text, making it difficult to look back and find them. As such, if you're looking for an analysis book that you can keep on your bookshelf as a useful reference after you're done learning the material, Rudin's text (or, better yet, if your preparation is sufficient, Royden's) seems a better choice."
5,Very lucid and ideal material for learning real analysis,"Most books on mathematics simply dump concepts,equations and examples and let you figure out what to do. Not this one. The book is written in a passionate manner where the author takes pains to explain why we are going in a particular direction and the goals. The style is extremely lucid and informal, something unusual for a subject that is steeped in formal mathematics. Yet the author presents, explains and covers all the formal theorems, concepts etc . The book also has excellent exercises. A truly noteworthy achievement. I would highly recommend this to anyone (especially self-study) trying to learn this subject."
4,"Experimental, heavy, and different","Many people might agree that other books may serve as a text for intro to analysis course better than 'The Way' . However, i find that the writing is very motivated (albeit sometimes he got carried away) and the math is, at least, comprehensible. I sometimes use this as a source of some challenging analysis problems. I am not really sure about using it as a main text, though (I used it as a supplementary text during my freshman year)."
2,Strichartz is the Hugo of the Math Textbook Genre,"The text is verbose and reads like a story. I would not recommend it for a strong proof-based analysis course. Instead of clearly defining terms and succinctly stating theorems, the author instead chooses to write 500-word digressions on some mystical notion called ""the way."" Jesus H. Christ, I want math textbook, not a cult text! Although you'd understand the origin of the ambigiousity in the book if you ever meet Strichartz in person."
2,Strichartz is a blabbering fool (and very fat and bald),"This is the most wordy math text I have ever read. I understand the author's desire to motivate definitions, but it sacrifices utility in the process. Indeed, this is absolutely the worst book to have as a reference. Some of the proofs say something to the effect of : ""... as you can see by the diagram, 'such and such' will happen QED.""Strichartz, I think, believes he is some type of mathematical philosopher (as is evident by the title ""The Way""), and he speaks to the reader in this way. I, for one, feel that this style is not well suited for a math textbook. He tries to awe the reader with the fine points of mathematics, and sacrifices true understanding in the process.I would recommend this book only as a supplement for someone learning analysis, and nothing more."
1,Worst text to use for intoductory analysis,"I agree with the reviewer below that wrote that Strichartz considers himself a philosopher--which he is not, by the way. This is an inferior text for a person who wants to learn analysis in a rigorous manner. This text is not only a pain in the @ss as a referemce, but it is also a confusing mess in which beginners at proofs (which is the target of this book) will be left utterly confused. Little pictures used as ""proofs"" and pondering the philosophical significance of some theorems does not make for a good text.Strichartz tries to come off as entertaining but fails miserably. His total detachment from reality is obvious in this pitifully drawn out text (oh the agony of his long, boring prose). This book is just another in the mass of mediocre introductory analysis texts."
4,One seriously talented band,"I first saw this seven person, twenty-plus instrument band open for the Shins, and I was hooked. This creative, youthful group fills this album with lyrically clever - and musically delightful - poppy love songs.To see them perform is a great pleasure, and this album manages to capture and project their unique presence!"
1,This book was very uneventful.,"Ash Wednesday, by Chet Williamson, is a yucky book. It concerns a small Pennsylvania town that gets rudely awakened at like, 4 in the morning by the appearance of all these blue ghosts popping up everywhere. My problem with the book is that the ghosts don't do anything. They just sit there, or stand there, or whatever, like wax dummies. This book concentrates more on the reactions of the people than the ghosts, and I wouldn't have called this book a horror novel at all. It certainly wasn't very horrifying, and I feel that calling it a horror novel is misleading to people that like to read horror, and would expect this book to be a horror novel. I was definitely misled."
2,Not as described,"I had to send this back as it does not cut anywhere close to the listing's claims of:""blade adjusts from Size 000 (1/100 inch)"" instead it will cut at a minimum of 1/25 inch and that only on vertical hairs. Any hairs that do not stand up are cut at closer to 1/8 inch.Compared to a Philips Norelco T980 the stubble is from twice as long on standing hair to four times as long on hair laying flat.I considered keeping it since returning it wasn't a good option. The refund was minus $18.00 in shipping costs and 10-15% of the price.I decided to send it back since aside from not cutting close enough for my needs I found for general hair clipping the gyroscopic forces from the motor were quite strong and the cord rather stiff."
3,Diffently mature,"this game is rated mature for good reason and it is not just because you get to beat the caddy. The outfits are skimpy, the characters grope each other. It is a fun game, but it is not for children."
1,Very fragile,"I bought this hat without Ironman logo. It was supposed to be made of Coolmax polyester. I highly doubt that claim. Believing it's washable as it says in the product feature, I put it in th washer. To my surprise, only after two or three time of washing, the edge of the visor started showing the sign of shred. After that, it got worsened each time I washed. Polyester is a very durable, abrasion resistant material and I have other hats made of polyester even though not saying Coolmax, and I washed them many time without coming apart. Even the hat made of 100% cotton lasted longer than this.Most of other hats I bought were $5.- to $7.-, $10.- tops. At more than $20.-, this hat is a big rip off.From what I see, Headsweats use the same material for many of their products.Highly NOT recommended (all Headsweats products)."
2,Build and Spill Musical Turtle,"I thought this toy would be a lot of fun for my 1 year old son, but it's not very easy to use. He likes the music, but has a hard time getting the blocks to stay on it and the shapes only go in one way so that's difficult also. It doesn't fit very many shapes before it has to be dumped so that's also not good. I wouldn't purchase this again."
3,Doesn't hold attention,I have three boys and the oldest got this when he was a year old. Barely played with it. Kid #2 never touched it. Kid #3 plays with it a little when his older brother plays with it with him. It's a rather large toy that doesn't do much. The blocks are fun - you'd be better off just getting the blocks.
1,Disappointing,"My kids have had this toy for a year and a half, and neither one has played with it for more than three minutes. The younger one can't seem to get the blocks to stack up, and the older one isn't interested in it. In my opinion, you'd be better off buying the Fisher Price Peek A Blocks 2-in-1 Activity Wagon. It's a similar toy that my kids have played with and enjoyed much more."
3,not that great,when my son first got this he liked to play with the stacking blocks. he never played with it much and i never see him playing with it now. and he has had it for 2 years. his one year old sister has never showed any interest in it either. every time i put the blocks into the turtle i find them taken out but the turtle never moves. so a better bet would just be stacking blocks.
1,What exactly are we supposed to do with it?,"My son diligently ignores this toy. He LOVES the blocks that go with it, but the turtle itself is kind of a waste."
2,Mounting plate problem.,I purchased this window mount and it looked OK until I attempted to mount the plate on the camera. The one I received has a plastic folding handle on the camera plate mounting screw that is wider than the recessed area under the plate. Rather than ship it back I cut away the shoulders in the recess to provide room for the screw to turn.( Couldn't alter the handle as it has a metal pin that holds it to the screw) Then when the handle is folded down I have to use a screwdriver or knife to fold it back up as it fits so tightly in the recess that I cannot access it with my finger. The rest of it seems to work OK.
3,Fair quality,"I expected the same material, quality, and durability as in the smaller diameter hose that came with my Fein vacuum. This hose seems to be built out of much thinner material, does not appear to be anti-static, and is twice the price of similar products. I was disappointed and would choose another brand the need to replace it arose. I have it permanently hooked up to my Festool miter saw as I think it too flimsy to use in a portable mode."
3,A true relief...a validating piece of work for new S&Ms,"Being relatively new to accept the lifestyle, I found Hart's book refreshingly honest and informative. It is a book that a newly-acknowledged submissive can read with her (his) dom/master. While not a psychoanalysis of the lifestyle, and not the authoritzative text to explain the lifestyle to ""outsiders"" it will certainly be an important work for those of us who have finally admitted our deep and longstanding desires and wish to know more of the details to living out our fantasies in a safe manner. As BDSMers know, the lifestyle is always Consensual and Safe...there's always a way out, so it's NOT abuse. Read this and learn more..."
4,A movie that I ACTUALLY enjoyed.,"I wasnt sure on if I would be interested in watching a film shot in Africa. I am an american and never really seen such a film before.I actually really enjoyed it. The cast was outstanding and the story was uniquely different. Normally, when I seefilms about spousal abuse, it has no meaning and no reason why the 'abuse' has started, but here with this film. It takes you step by step and really helps the audience understand the WHY it started...I recommend it highly. The production value is also very good. Its kindda like Hollywood meets africa. ..Looking forward to checking out more of their films as well."
3,Meh,"Contrary to the first reviewers naive opinion, this movie does nothing to explain domestic violence. It doesn't happen because of some physical or emotional trauma of an abuser. Those are just handy excuses that the general public, and apparently the first reviewer, are willing to swallow. It gives an abuser not only an excuse, but makes the abuser a victim in everyones eyes. Abuse happens because an abuser feels ENTITLED to treat the victim however they want. The only person to blame for abuse is the abuser. Not the victim, not his Mama or his Daddy, absolutely no one and nothing is to blame but the abuser, put the blame where it belongs, squarely on the abusers shoulders.The only thing an abuser deserves or is entitled to is CONTEMPT. The longer people keep accepting all the ""poor wittle me"" excuses abusers will spoon feed you the longer his victim suffers."
5,Inspirational,"I found this to be a very insightful and inspirational book!Filled with stunning example after stunning example that make you pause in awe, this is a straight forward and well written book that belongs in the serious photographer's reference library.I refer back to this book often to keep focused on effective use of colour and composition, which I try to incorporate into my photographic endeavors.If you're looking for material that is rewarding and makes you want to run out and shoot - this publication suits the bill!"
3,Don't expect to recreate these images w/o some serious equipment.,"I only can give this book 3 stars based on the fine pictures. All the pictures were shot with medium format gear. You can't get these images with you're DSLR and certainly not your point and shoot.If you would like to buy a book to view some great pictures...buy this one.If you're an amateur and think you can recreate these pictures, think again unless you have $$$$$ lots of money as medium format gear is not cheap.This book should be titled Photos with IMPACT...that you will probably never recreate in your lifetime."
2,Pretty much useless as field/pocket guide,"I bough this pocket book and haven't found useful even once. In Internet age, this book renders itself pretty much useless. The book mainly has one pages with color photo of one of the deep sky objects and a very dry short description on the other page. That's pretty much about it. You can find all these photos on Internet in much better resolution or in the software like TheSky just by clicking on object. The accompanied description is just dry numerical tid-bits printed in font that discourages reading it. There are no constellation maps. You can find much better quality and interesting history, significance and field notes on Internet. May be this is not the authors fault. The description is supposed to be limited to that tiny page, what else they can do?"
2,The Capitalized Value of One's Time,"Even for many serious music-lovers, Sorabji's Opus Clavicembalisticum has an opportunity cost too great. Perhaps musicologists, poseurs, and musical geniuses can reasonably find the time for it. For the rest of us, it lies in the stage of negative marginal returns. I am not a critic of Sorabji, nor do I object to ne plus ultra complexity. I believe artists should do whatever they want. But whether it is Finnigan's Wake or grocery boxes nailed to the museum wall, some art is primarily cult material. A cult, one should remember, is not necessarily an elite."
2,"Ignore Magde's claque, go with Ogdon!","There is certainly a striking disparity among the reviews posted - praise from, for example, an admitted associate of Madge, and slanderous, disgraceful, utterly contemptible condemnation of Ogdon (""awash in anti-psychotic medication""? ""not one brain cell working""? - the person who wrote this is a pig). I can only say that, having known the piece first from Madge's recording, and having recently acquired the Ogdon, there is no comparison. Ogdon makes music - and great, astonishing music - where Madge produces endless streams of uncharacterised, undifferentiated note-spinning. The fugues, in particular, are utterly mechanical and apparently devoid of any comprehension in Madge's reading. To be sure, he certainly deserves credit for tackling the work, but one wonders why he released this recording - and why he tolerates, if he does, the blatantly offensive, disgusting claquery of his supporters."
2,Early Cook needed better recipe for success,"As Thomas H. Cook's first book, it certainly doesn't provide a glimmer of the brilliance that is to come in his later achievements. Having read many of his more recent novels, I am now seeking to complete reading the remainder of his collection. The woman at the bookstore warned me that Blood Innocents was not like his other books, and she was right. I would look at the cover from time to time to make sure that the middle initial was the same! My advice is to re-read Breakheart Hill."
3,a well constructed crime mystery,"This is Cook's first novel, written back in 1980 and is a commendable beginning. The book is a well thought out, well constructed crime mystery with a believable, realistic conclusion. It is unfortunately a rather short piece (only 230 pages) and because of that limitation, the main character, Reardon, lacks a little depth. I found myself enjoying the book but wishing to know more about the man the book centered around. This book could have been more than just good, but instead excellent if Cook had spent a few more words on the subplots."
4,Will read more Thomas Cook,"Gripping. Very well written with a totally unexpected ending. Would recommend this book to anyone looking for mystery, murder and one plot twist after another."
2,Beware MAC users,"The company does not let you know that it is not a user friendly camera for MAC...it does say ""optional Capty DVD for making DVD Video software provide seamless integration into the Apple Macintosh computer world""... empasize the OPTIONALl. You have to buy it for 125$ more."
2,TRY THE ALTERNATIVES BEFORE YOU BUY !!!!,"Been a JVC movie man for many years, and decided to update the well-travelled Mini-tape model to the shiny new HDD MG20 (purchased in Dubai while on holiday). Lovely quality, easy to use....BUT DON'T BUY IT before you check if the low-lighting results are acceptable to you. It might be fine for you, in which case this is a good buy, but not for us; colours faded, exceptionally grainy....even the software doesn't get it up to the levels we had from the old model.Returned it to JVC, who returned it as being absolutely fine, and I have been told I must take it back to the retailer...IN DUBAI !!So, this long-time JVC family are moving elsewhere. Recommendations appreciated."
1,JVC Does Not Stand Behind Their Products - JVC Lemoncorder,"I agree with the many other users who have experienced the ""Condensation, Operation Paused"" defect on their JVC GR-XXX. Despite numerous others reporting this problem, JVC says its not a recognized problem. I would disagree - it is a recognized problem, but its your problem, not theirs."
2,JVC MG 20 /30 ..PLEASE DON'T BUY IT,i bought it yesterday and going to return it today just because of its worst video quality....yes...! if you can compromise video quality....than you can surely go for buying this....no user friendly functions...complexity is everywhere..hdd is not 20 GB...in my case its only 17.5 GB. and yes...very disappointed customer service....nothing is good in this camcorder except good zoom and storage capacity....video in night is worst ever......please don't waste your money to buy it....PLEASE
4,Good Collection,"1. Devil May Hare (1954, McKimson; stars Bugs and Taz, the latter in his first appearance)2. Birds of a Father (1961, McKimson; stars Sylvester and Sylvester Jr)3.

Room and Bird (1951, Freleng; stars Sylvester and Tweety)I really enjoy ""The Ducksters"" (which is an underrated cartoon), ""Birds of a Father,"" and ""Room and Bird"" (one of the best in the Tweety and Sylvester series)."
3,"Flower Arranging For The Novice, Simplified","This is a wonderful reference, providing easy to follow directions and stunning color photographs for the novice Floral Designer. Most of the displays would be perfect in the home or for display at more conservative business events and church use. Lots and lots of choices here, with most of the materials needed readily available at your local craft store..no searching fruitlessly for floral design elements that are only available in large Metropolitan areas. It is also a great text for 'diverging' into more creative directions without neglecting the basics of display construction."
5,Probably the best British Comedy Series ever made!,A brilliant depiction of what the monotony of British life can do to you
5,Beautiful scale!,"This scale has sort of a retro look to it that I just love. It is real heavy too, real sturdy. It matches my bathroom so well -- the shiny metal and all that. The dial is easy to see and seems to be pretty accurate -- it compares to my doctor's office pretty close, so that must be good. I have it on my floor which is tile which is what the instructions say to put it on for stability. There is plenty of room for my feet too but it is not real huge. My friends all say that it looks real good too."
3,"Good, quick, memorable read about a neat adventure.","I thought I should put a review up here to even out the bad reviews.I thought ""Tales From Fish Camp"" was a pleasant read. The book is basically the narrative thoughts of a girl's adventure to an Alaskan fish camp for a few months. I thought the book read like a 'zine. And since I am a big fan of 'zines, I really enjoyed the book.It only took me about 2 hours to get through the whole thing, but I found the writing and the stories she told very inspiring. It brought back a good deal of good memories of my own adventures and friends that I haven't seen for a long time. I'm glad Danielle Henderson took the time to write her memories down from this interesting time of her life and share them with us."
1,Something to Not Try,Well after reading the reviews on here I decided to give this a try.I was disappointed. The good reviews on here promised me something else as did her blog. I did not enjoy the writing. I feel as if the writer should have waited a bit before putting this to print and worked on this a little more.The writing is amateurish at best. But it fits the genre and type of book it is.I'm glad I didn't pay for this as I would have demanded my money back. I'm not in the habit of paying blank pages in books.If you're looking for an extremely light read then pick it up. But I recommend that you read it at Barnes and Noble instead of buying it.
2,major drop in work,"A Kiss in Space is a major drop in quality of work. Anyone who has read Salter's books Sunday Skaters or Unfinished Paintings knows Salter is a top notch poet, but A Kiss in Space is just not up to the standard I'm used to seeing from her. I hope her latest book is back up there."
2,Needs more clips to work with beard,"This is good but not too good. It has only two clips ,not enough to shape the beard to the desired length. It needs more clips to get desired shapes of mustache and beard ."
1,Buy something better,"I bought this thing at a Walgreens and have hated it since day one. The motor isn't strong enough to trim anything unless you use the stupid ""turbo"" mode, which means that you have to hold down a button the whole time you are trimming, making it VERY uncomfortable to use. It has lasted a very long time, which is why I haven't made myself spend the money for a new one. However, I used it again today on my beard and moustache, and I can't stand it another day. If you take my advice, you'll NEVER buy a beard trimmier that makes you push in a button the whole time you use it."
3,Works well but battery is poor after a year,"I've been using this for about a year or so, and it works pretty well.For the price its hard to complain. I rinse it off all the time and shake off the water, and it still works good.I've never oiled the blades or anything either.The problem is the battery. It used to last for about 15 minutes which is not groundbreaking but does the job, but now after a year or so, im lucky if it lasts 5 minutes."
1,Negative 5 stars - The most awful Trek tribute ever,"This was the absolute worst ""tribute"" show I have ever seen, Trek or non-Trek. Jason Alexander, et al, who were supposed to be giving this tribute gave the worst impressions of Kirk, Spock and Bones. They were really bad. The so-called clips were 5 seconds for the longest, and just zipped by so fast you could hardly see them, much less tell what episode or movie they came from.I am just glad that if I had to sit through this I did when it was on TV so that I didn't have to pay anything extra for it. They should pay you to take it off their hands."
1,waste o cash,"Star Trek may have some great moments, unfortunatly few make it into this video...and Jason Alexander's commentary through this dog makes it painful to get to those few scenes. I am so bummed I laid down cash for this thing. UUUUGGGGHHHHH. Don't buy it!! Buy City on the Edge of Forever (TOS), or the Best of Both Worlds I @ II (TNG), or even a William Shatner novel, but not this."
1,Inane and a waste of time,"The best part about this show is the opening MTV style Techno Trek theme and flashfire clips. Jason Alexander is inane and fills the time between the trek clip with a humorless and lame attempt to emulate the William Shatner school of overacting. Catch a rerun of any trek episode before you buy this dog.... When it ran on UPN, I immediately put the tape I'd recorded it on back onto the blank pile. and I like a bit of Doctor who, so for me to say this is bad is saying something..."
5,For any Stephen King lover,"This is a wonderful trivia item for anyone who loves Stephen King. there are 100 quizzes, and over 1000 questions about King's works. It's a great way to test your true knowledge of the 'King' of horror fiction!"
5,"Single source of all rational civilization of humanity, as a whole.","I would like to thank to great scientist for his great contribution to social sciences and yet to all humanity. It can be your life-saver if you strive to make real research in this post-modern condition.If you cannot see the importance and meaning of the books and important difference between two volumes, it is better to question your own ""dasein"" in academic field. Good luck.."
4,Review,"My mother, who is a vet, recommended this book to me. I thinking she was right to say it is interesting, and I enjoyed it a lot. I never knew dead bodies could do so much for us."
3,Good clothes rack,"I like this clothes rack, but it's a bit cheaply made. Shortly after I received in in the mail, one of the pieces of plastic split and I am holding it together with tape. Would also be nice if they have ""arms"" that swiveled out for lingerie. I've seen another model that had that feature and thought it was really useful."
4,Very Good for the Price,"I needed white suspenders for my tails that used clips instead of buttons. This one is a bit cheap looking, but works OK. The metal is fairly low grade steel. So far it is performing fine, and I am pleased with the purchase. As for longevity, time will tell!"
3,Student Problem Manual to accompany Investments,"Though it is good, not worth for the money we need to spend to buy this book."
4,oxygen III narrowband filter,"This filter is only good with a 10"" telescope or better,did bring out the details of nebula's because it darkens the back ground,don't expect to see colors of the nebula's without the aid of a camera and Photoshop,overall its not that bad"
5,Near East Pasta,"Like the others, I love this pasta for a side; goes great with anything! Then suddenly, my huge grocery store that has everything doesn't carry it anymore,...WHY???? They always get rid of the best items,..makes me furious! And they kept the Rice-a-Roni brand pasta that can't even compare to this one. Go figure. I'll buy it by the twelve pack then,..it will go fast. It's awesome,...grill some shrimp and fresh veggies and serve this with it, along with a chilled glass of white wine,.....heaven!"
1,Liza: One Unlucky Lady,"The only reason to watch Stanley Donen's Lucky Lady (Shout! Factory) is to hear the Kander-Ebb title track, hear the blond bewigged Liza Minnelli mumble the famous ""fish fart"" line and remember that Liza was having a mad love affair wtih co-star Burt Reynolds during the making of this silly romp about booze-running during the prohibition. Watch closely . . . that's a wig co-star Robby Benson is wearing; he had shaved his head for his role in Death be Not Proud and the tresses hadn't grown back yet. Lucky Lady is an unlucky comedy that tries, so hard, to be screwball. Instead, it's screwy. Liza chose this as her Cabaret follow-up? Yikes! To paraphrase John and Fred: How unlucky can you get?"
1,BIG BOMB NOT SO LUCKY,"This was a career killer for LIza, made just a few years after winning her Oscar for her brilliant performance Cabaret (1972) and her career was never the same again. Terrible in every way from the mugging of the actors, including the great Gene Hackman, never worse, and Burt Reynolds, who could not even charm his way through this mess. How bad? One of the lines is, ""It's so quiet in here you could hear a fish...fart.""Oh belly laugh...oh bust a gut...NOT!!!! One of the worst films of the seventies."
2,WARNING LABEL NEEDED! - DECEPTIVE PRODUCT!,"Yes, Bob Marley & the Wailers VOICES are on this CD, but all the music was produced on a computer by a man named Bernd Hess. This album is only for the very curious, who might enjoy Bob, Bunny, & Peters original vocals mixed in with midi arrangments devised by Mr. Hess, (which have different chords than the original songs). The final result is not really bad. But the packaging states 'Played & Arranged by Bernd Hess' in such small print that I cannot see how any store or Online-CD concern would have a leg to stand on if a customer demanded a refund for this obviously fake Marley album. If the cover stated 'Bernd Hess Plays New Arrangements of the Music of Bob Marley', I would have no quarrel with it."
3,"Good, based on its price",Let me get to the points.Pros: It was easy for my husband to put together.LightweightCons: Wobbles (maximum weight is 225 and the person I bought it for is 200lbs)The basket is underneath the seat so you have to get up to reach items inbasket.When you fold the walker you have to remove the basket.There is a string you have to pull when you want to close the walkerand then sometimes you have to hold onto the string so it won't comeflying open.Overall I would recommend buying this walker if you had to buy a cheap walker really fast. Otherwise spend a little bit more and invest in something else.
1,Item arrived broken--no response from seller,"This seller sent out a product with a faulty weld so that it broke before anyone got the chance to use the item. We wrote the seller, through Amazon, and asked them how they wished to handle this and they have never responded. We wrote another email to them, again through Amazon, asking them not to ignore the problem and to please respond to our email. They have not responded to that either. It is looking like we are just stuck. One star is generous.Item: Rollator with Dual Brakes by Rollators Light Weight in Burgundy"
5,Very satisfied customer!!,I purchased this for my granny and we were both thrilled at the quality of the product and excellent service! We received free shipping and this product arrived within 2 days!! We were very impressed by the affordable price and incredible quality. I would highly recommend this product and company to all my friends and family and everyone!
2,CAUTION WEIGHT CAPACITY is ONLY 250 LBS>,"Yes it is a Medline but Amazon has the ""Product Description"" as a 300 lb. weight capacity , Medline won't accept the return because it was bought through ""Amazon"", they said to call Medline for returns so its just a run around from both parties,the unit appears to be very nice itself just wanted a higher weight cap."
3,Otherwise OK,"This is generally a nicely made product, quite sturdy. Good value, but, we ran into a problem with the brakes. They work well in most circumstances but can be less effective when trying to lock them. Adjusting them several times helped but never fully resolved the problem. (The manual is of some help, the manufacturer was essentially unhelpful.) In looking at several of this type of thing, it seems that most use a similar braking system so I don't know if any other unit would be any better."
5,Great Product!!!,"This is a great buy. It was everything that they said it would be. I was very impressed. It's even better than I exepected. The price was great and it arrived very quickly. I did alot ofr comparison and this is a great buy. very easy to use and assembly is not to difficult, although it's not super easy either."
4,Review/Rollator folding deluxe walkabout,"The item I ordered was for my sister. It arrived, and she is very happy with product.Thank you,Dian D. Jones"
3,Rollator,"I did not need the large Rollator, this one is very wide; I know there are smaller width ones. Other than that the product arrived safely and is good."
1,WAS NOT AS DESCRIBED,"First of all the stated weight is incorrect, with the packaging it comes to 26 lbs as marked on the carton; so the unit itself is not as lightweight as advertised, which could make a difference to someone unable to handle (fold up, put into car/trunk, etc) a heavier walker. Also, it states the brakes lock and we were unable to determine how that is possible (to lock the brakes). I would be interested in knowing if this was a problem for anyone else. Overall the unit was sturdy and the wheels rolled easily, but ultimately my Dad decided it was not for him. The return process was fairly simple."
5,"Love, love, love","This product!!! Please, NEVER stop making and selling it... It's the only thing that helps! I am over 40 and my metabolism has grinded to a stand still.. Follow directions EXACTLY... Treat your body nicely and don't eat junk and exercise! Counting calories work well with this! Stick to it use it at least 60 days, start a food journal !"
1,This is Middle English poetry?,"I purchased this book believing it contained the beautiful poem, The Owl and the Nightingale, written in the twelfth or possibly thirteenth century. And I suppose it does - kinda. But the poem has been rendered into modern English, thereby destroying most of its beauty and all the sense of antiquity it should convey. What a disappointment. Look around for a better copy - that's what I'm going to do..."
1,"Should be called ""Real BAD Food""","The voice in this book is nice--it makes you feel like cooking, which should happen when you read a cookbook. However, I tired 3-4 recipes out of it and without exception, the results were at best weird. The recipes are consistently without complete instructions or information about how a certain ingredient is to be prepared (cubed? grated? put in whole?). You'll spend extra time trying to figure out how to make the recipes work or be flavorful--so much for ""fast."" Leaving out key ingredients leads to disastrous results.I'm a good cook with prodessional experience and have certainly had a lot of success with other cookbooks. This one is just singularly bad. Skip it."
5,WOW!,"This has to be the most beautiful singing I have ever heard. A perfect voice! I am more suprised that she hasn't had more music out there!This music is similar to chant music. You find a comfortable, peaceful place and turn it on.... and go where it takes you.This ex-manhattan transfer sure has had her troubles. But it is nice to see her back in the saddle and putting others to shame. I only hope to hear more of her wonderful voice."
2,Resistant?,"We've got some small black ants that have invaded our kitchen. If we keep it clean, there's not swarms, but they are always sprinkled about the counters and cupboards.I put the MaxAttrax Ant Bait stations in their path, and most of the ants turn and run the instant their antennae touch the plastic! Could ants have developed a repellent detection of the active ingredient (Indoxacarb)? I tried cleaning off the outer surface of a station, but at best the ants crawl over it and completely ignore it. After days I have yet to see an ant take the slightest interest in a station, even though they find anything else sweet worth eating. Perhaps it's just this species, which unfortunately I can't name."
1,Maxattrax is bunk,I have this product down for a week inside my home and the ant population has INCREASED
5,Dressing review,"This is a good dressing for a border gauze. Has good protection and keeps the wound dry. I have used this product several time, and will continue to use it."
2,"Too big, too heavy","I read that this gadget was heavy, but I didn't believe it. It's made of plastic and aluminum, how heavy can it be? Well it weighs in at almost 15 ounces! At 8"" long and 4-1/2"" wide, it's built like a battleship.Try and use this on a smaller telescope and you'll have quite a balancing chore to perform. It appears to be sized for an older generation of much larger cameras.One good thing, the little L-shaped foot at the bottom is threaded like a camera, so if your camera and scope are light enough, just clamp them both to this behemoth and screw the adapter itself to the tripod.If this were half the size and half the weight, it would be a winner. As it is, I can't imagine how I'll use it."
3,Digital camara adapter,"I bought this in hopes that I could use it with my Kodak P-850 SLR digital camara, in conjunction with my Celestron 130 SLT telescope to obtain digital photos.Sorry to say that it doesn't have the required focal length for my camara. I added a bracket, to obtain the length, but it took alot of work, & time to get MY camara to work on my telescope.Limited (short) focal distance. Better to spend the extra money, and get a better ""universal"" digital camara adapter.It would work ok, (I think) for the lower end, (Small objective lens) ""point & shoot"" camaras."
3,Heavy but efficient,"This is a good product and well made, unfortunately I agree with some of the other reviews that it is too heavy and is about as heavy as my spotting scope. When the camera, adapter and scope all attached my cheap tripod, it just couldn't function properly, so had to use the window mount instead. Overall it performed its function and usually I am a big fan of merchandise that is sturdy but in this case I think a really good one could be made and weigh about half as much, after all most digital camera's are not bazookas and this could support one of those! If you want sturdy, bulky, by all means this is your product."
2,This is not universal,"A Camera with a large zoom doesn't fit with this adapter, this is not universal. Only works with the ultra compact digital cameras."
3,Decent adaptor with limited use,"One nice adaptor for a small digital camera. Easy to set the camera on and adjust it (collimate if you wish) with the telescope eyepiece.However, with the clamp about an inch wide, setting it on plossl eyepieses is not quite possible. Check first if your eyepiece has enough body to accomodate it. My 20 mm Celestron eyepiece is just OK for that. Also, the camera must be pretty slim. Canon IXUS series cameras are nearly perfect for the purpose.And as soon as you are able to set it on your scope - you will have no problem taking some happy snaps of the Moon and other celestial objects. Make sure you use manual mode on the camera and selftimer set at 10 seconds at least. Setting exposure to -1 or -2 helps a lot to Moon pictures quality."
2,Frustrating. Too heavy for small telescopes.,"Not universal as the description says. I cannot use it with on my Astromaster 70. The problem is the weight of the mount alone makes anything you want to photograph go out of the frame. I've spent many hours trying to get pictures of planets using this and I've gotten little more than frustration. If you have giant scopes that can take an extra pound (in mount weight alone) without budging, then by all means, this will work well.I've emailed Celestron customer support. Even they say with smaller telescopes you might as well hold the camera by hand or use a separate tripod,(or find a lighter mount)."
3,Might work for some.,"Doesn't really fit my Nexstar 5se unless I'm using a small low quality eyepiece which defeats the purpose. Thought was put into the design but overall I think this contraption is unnecessarily clunky. Considering the $50 hit plus the cost of a decent quality point & shoot that would be required for this setup; you could buy the T adapter / barlow combo and a micro SLR camera for about $300 which would be much better solution.Bought & returned, amazon is excellent."
4,Good but,Works good with a little work. I have a Kodak Dx7590 and it does not fit. A little work and extra pieces and you can get it to work. Just be careful if you have a wide camera with a longer lens it may not fit.
2,Not for every point and shoot camera,This might work for some cameras but not mine.It does not have enough adjustment for my Kodak camera to align with the eyepiece.
1,Disappointed,"Product is well made, very robust but not enough adjustment for my digital camera. Product details need to explain minimum and maximum position adjustment of height and depth that can be achieved so one can work out if it will suit a particular camera."
5,Must have Crate!,"Needed to get a new larger crate for my puppy who outgrew the one we bought at the Pet Superstore/s.This one is hands down 100% better. Very roomy for my puppy, both in height and width (bigger than the ones at the stores).Best thing about the crate is it's ability to be broken down and stored in less than 2 minutes!Thanks again to Amazon and Midwest - great product w/ super fast delivery!"
2,inflexible design - door swing,"This crate works, but I think its design limits its usefulness. The door should be made so that the direction it opens can be reversed. This would make the crate fit in more orientations. Better still, would be if all that was required to switch the swing of the door was flipping the crate over. But this crate is not symmetric. and the sides are not easily removed to change them. This crate is big (mine is 42"" L model), but if you want your dog to be able to go inside on his own, the also very big door must be open, taking up even more room. Again, this may not be a problem for everyone but a simple design switch would make this more flexible. You could probably hack it and make things work, but I didn't pay for this thing so I could edit it. I'm going to return it and look for something that will give me some options. Two doors maybe...On the plus side, I love how quickly it breaks down."
5,Better Dog Crate than expected,This is much better than I anticipated especially for the price. Mine arrived in perfect condition & is easy to setup and take down. Good vendor!
4,great for the price,Easy to put together. The top lock gives me a hard time...it doesn't easily fit into the slot when i try to lock my puppy in there but it does lock after a few tries. I am glad i got this size and not a smaller one because even for my 5 month old yorkshire terrier there's barely enough room for a small bed and almost a whole wee wee pad. Obviously the food container and water bottle (bought separately) are suspended in the air otherwise they'd never fit in. Overall i am happy with the product and i recommend it.
5,Folding dog crate,"I bought two of these cages for our dogs to stay in while we are at work during the day. They love the extra room that they have and it was easy to find doggie pillows that fit the cage bottom perfectly. If we travel, we can fold them and take them with us. These were the perfect answer to what we were looking for!"
4,Crate is great,"Crate works fine for my crazy puppy. Seems to be well constructed and solid. Door works good, pan slides nice.It's not the thickest metal, but it doesn't seem to be a problem. Just so folks know it's not solid like a shopping cart. But still very sturdy."
3,XLG folding crate,"the crate arrived via UPS who evidently beat the crap out of the box. However, the crate itself was undamaged. The crate is as large as advertised although I don;t feel that it is particularly heavy duty and sturdy. The front door will not latch without a great deal of effort where you have to force it to bend in at the bottom to line up the latch. I'm not really unhappy with the item but it appears to be a reminder that you get what you pay for."
2,would have been great.,This product would have been good if it had shipped on time.... ended up returning this and buying one for the same price after visiting about 10 retailers in the area. The crate itself is a good size for my terrior beagle mix. and easy to assemble/durable
4,Good crate except.....,"Bought for stepmom's new rescue dog(aka ""The Devil""). This was the third crate for this dog, it totally destroyed the previous two, this one he only ate the plastic tray in the bottom!"
5,This Crate Saved my House,My husband had purchased a smaller crate for more money before I came on to Amazon and ordered. We took the other crate back and purchased this one. We ordered Friday and it came Saturday with Prime Shipping. The crate was easy and quick to assemble. We put our two small dogs in there. We have a chihuhua and a mini pincher/chihuahua mix. I felt bad for crating them but the mini is a puppy and is tearing up our home. They love their crate and our very comfortable in there. When we get ready to leave they go right in. I live that you can add handles to top if you need to move it. Overall a great buy and I recommend!
4,Good Product,"This crate has worked VERY well for our German Shepherd puppy. As others have mentioned, the divider is a little bit difficult to install and adjust as the puppy grows, but it's a wonderful idea! We trained him to know his crate is not a punishment. Now he goes in there to lay on his bed and play with his toys. I would recommend buying a crate bed or placing a folded blanket or towel on the floor of the crate. The slide out tray is very convenient, but we haven't needed to clean it....yet. Another thing...this crate comes with handles, but isn't very portable!!! It's steel, and remember...steel isn't light, however, this has been an extremely durable enclosure thus far. I looked at several other crates, and I'm glad I purchased this one."
4,Does what I expected,It was easy to put together and my dog's very comfortable with it. My only problem is that the puppy has somehow managed to eat the handles that I had hooked onto the crate.
4,Good value and light.,"This crate is light and very easy to assemble. The tray is easy to remove and wash. The crate itself is also easy wipe down and the black color actually makes it look less like a ""cage"" for my dog. You can't beat the price. The only complaint is the latch at the base which is lose when the crate is assembled.I only used this briefly when I first got my dog. I found it was easier to give my dog his own little room and a litter box so he has more freedom. He never liked the crate much, but I plan on saving this crate for when I travel and need a place for him to sleep."
4,42 inch dog crate,"This crate was bent somewhat under the door. It still works, but is a little stiff to put up and take down. For the price, however, I would still buy it again. It works fine for a 100 lb. golden retriever who is quite a handful!!"
4,Good value. Fast delivery.,I purchased this crate for my new Doberman. He is a rescue from Mississippi and must have spent a lot of time in a crate. He loves the crate and has built quite a nest in there. The crate is well made and works well for crate trained dogs that do not try to get out. I would not recommend this type of crate (folding) for dogs that bounce around or try to get out as they could get the sides undone.The only drawback is that when I opened the box the pan had a big chunk out of it. I am working to resolve this issue. Since the crate is so big and we had limited space to open it the box had to be cut apart so returning it is not an option.I ordered it on a Sunday and it was on my doorstep Tuesday.
3,the door is funky,i have several of this type of dog crate. they fold up and are easy to carry and set back up anywhere. but the door on this one looks like it may have been welded wrong? it doesn't fit into the clips on the side panels the way it's supposed to.
3,inexpensive and poorly made,Both my husband and I cut our fingers on the metal fasterners on the cage. Other than that it is a great kennel for the price.
4,"Single-Door Folding Metal Dog Crate, 42 Inches by 28 Inches by 31 Inches","Good value for the money, Sturdy cage, easy assembly and setup. Chief drawback is only one door, would be nice if there were an additional door in center or on top."
4,Dog Is Happy,"This item was shipped to me VERY FAST. I am very satisfied with it. My puppy loved it after we put it together, she had been sharing with my other dog at night. She layed in it for hours and didn't have to. Great product it is holding up very well, all the pieces were there, I like it very much."
5,Excellent crate!,"Bought this for a small dog based on reviews on Amazon.com. So glad I listened. Crate is top notch and folds easily for travel. Sturdy, lightweight and perfect for our precious pooch. Highly recommended item and seller. Would do business again with seller in a heartbeat."
5,Great purchase!,"My dog was chewing on all the other crates I had purchased for him. This crate is perfect since he can't bite through the metal bars. Set-up was quick and easy, and it's also pretty light weight. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. Pricing was great, cheapest price I could find online."
5,Great product!,"The kennel was a breeze to put together, we had been looking for a kennel for our new puppy for several days; this one is by far the best price. No more worries about house training or safety while we're gone."
4,"Great crate, not so great handles","I've had this crate for almost a year and it still working great. It's quick and easy to fold down or up and move around, and even though when my dog was a pup he would push on the door, there is no bent wires or hinges. It's very easy to clean as well. Only complaint is the handles given to assist in carrying it broke within a month. The handles are cheap pieces of plastic that clip on. A simple bump in the car broke one, and the other broke while I was carrying it. Makes it harder now to carry but all in all a good product"
4,Seems to work ok,"I bought this crate for our 65lb German Shepard Mix. Seems to be the perfect size for him. Good price compared to many local stores. Easily assembles, I haven't taken in down to move or store yet, so I can't comment on that. My only complaint was the metal tabs that kind of hold the crate together are kind of weak, my dog bumped into one of the walls of the crate the 1st day and it was enough force to break one of the tabs off. Nothing a few well placed zipties won't fix. If you have a dog that will really struggle and try to force its way out, this crate might not be strong enough. But if your dog is like mine and just kind of bumps it while moving around inside, it should be ok."
3,Not bad,"Sturdy manufacture, accomplishes the objective of an adjustable crate for a growing puppy. However, the vertical bars by the door are not well-finished and we've scratched ourselves several times reaching in to adjust one thing or another. The adjustment partition works very well, but is not the easiest thing to hook and unhook. Could you some design and manufacture improvements."
5,Great Crate at a Great Price,"This crate is just as good as the ones you see at the pet store for $150 - $200 for half of the price. It is durable, easy to set up, and our dog has learned to love it. Great value!"
2,I bought the crate for a 70+ lb dog and my 55 lb dog breaks out within 2 minutes,"We purchased this crate several weeks ago for our new dog, who's a 10 month old husky mix, weighs about 55 lbs. We got him a crate that's a big larger than he needs, so he wouldn't feel too trapped. He immediately figured out how to break out of the thing. The clips on the side bent around immediately, so we used pliers to wrap them around a little more tightly. Again, he figured out how to squeeze through the seams within a couple of minutes. I'm very disappointed in the quality. I'd return it but I don't have the box or receipt anymore.If anyone has suggestions for a better solution, please let me know."
5,Perfect for my Bichon/Poodle,"I've had this crate for just about a year now, we use it every day and it has held up very well. It is the perfect size for my 15 lb Bichon/Poodle. She has plenty of room to lay down but not too much room. We have taken it camping several times and on many weekend trips and is still in great condition. I would say we average breaking it down and setting it up again at least once a month if not more.The divider that comes with it is a lifesaver for those that are potty training pupppies. The bottom tray can be taken out fairly easily but I just wiped it out most of the time. I wouldn't hestiate to purchase another one. The price for this was much less than other ones and it has held up better than I expected it to."
2,Couldn't hold up,"I have a 70 lb Alaskan husky pup with some separation anxiety issues. We bought this crate to ease him back into crate training after he grew out of his old one and sort of fell of the crate training wagon for a bit. After warming him up to the crate, the first time I left him alone in the crate for an hour he had kicked the bottom tray out, bent in the bottom front bars and popped the front and back door off enough to squeeze out and meet me at the front door when I came home. Needless to say this crate does not work for us, as our dog is able to work his way out of it in a matter of minutes. Maybe it would work better for a smaller dog?"
3,not what i assumed...,"crate door does not fold back on itself - as i assumed a good designed crate would do. my 1st time ever owning a crate trained dog. my timid 14 lb terrier mix rescue goes in it often to sleep and for security so i don't close the door.hense, the door stuck out and was forever in the way - until i used pliers and removed it permanently. on the bright side, it was a literal snap to set up."
2,PUPPY ESCAPES FROM THIS CRATE,My puppy has escaped from this crate twice and one time was found with his head stuck between the front and side panels. He escaped with the doors bolted shut. He managed to unhook the hooks holding the panels together and wedged his way out. This crate does not work for me.
3,Crate duty rating comparison,"Midwest's crates come in three ""duty"" ratings, light, medium, and heavy which correspond to their iCrate, Life Stages, and Ultima Pro lines respectively. The higher duty rating comes from heavier wire being used in the same sized crate.Midwestpetproducts.com website states the following:""Midwest provides the perfect home for every breed and temperament.Light Duty: For new puppies that will be crate trained from the start and for breeds with a mild temperament.Medium Duty: for older puppies and breeds with an average temperament.Heavy Duty: for adult dogs that have never been crate trained and for active breeds.""Wish they identified the duty rating clearly with their different product lines."
