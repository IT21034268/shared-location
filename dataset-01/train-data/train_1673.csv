2,Should have been a magazine article,Interesting topic but drawn out. Could have simply been stated in a magazine article..
4,Great Book,"I recommend this book to every woman. I plan to give a copy to each of my female friends. I have read a lot of finance/get rich how to books. This one was one of the better ones. Dr. Frankel is plain spoken, easy to understand and does understand why women have more difficulty than men in amassing wealth. Buy the book!"
2,Who's the Target Audience?,"I didn't find this book especially helpful. It seems the author could not decide who her target audience is: is it middle aged women who make $100K a year or 23 year old women making $25K? I also didn't think the financial advice was nearly as interesting or helpful as books written by finance professionals; the author is a therapist by training. It also seems that much of the advice is for women who are entirely passive, and I'm not sure most women fall into this category (I certainly do not.) Save your money."
5,I loved this book!!!,"I just finished this book a few minutes ago and am still smiling! I loved it!! I fell in love with Lindsay and Noah and their day to day adventures! If two people never should have met again, it would have been these two!! But Noah doesn't give up!! He is very persistent and Lyndsay can not resist him!! The ending was awesome, Lynn wrapped it up very nicely. All in all, I loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good old fashioned romantic comedy!!!"
4,Could have been a five,"""Return Engagement"" is a good read. I really enjoy how Lynn Michaels not only creates memorable leading characters but also secondary characters as well. In this book, the whole family of Lindsay and members of her small home town are unforgetable. They add such depth to the story, and a lot of laughs as well. I must say though that the frequent use of vulgarity brought my rating down. The book would have been great without it. The story starts a little slow but is worth the ride once it gets going."
3,A cute romance,"A very light, sweet, and fluffy romance. Not my usual genre, but a somewhat enjoyable read. I enjoyed the different characters and what they brought to the story, however, I had a hard time with the love-hate-back-and-forth relationship between Noah and Lindsay. Just thought the book was ok."
3,Second Chances,"Really enjoyed the 2 main characters, especially their bantering quips and antics. Nice to see that Noah worked to get himself back on track and wasn't someone who thought he was ""owed"" something. I could have done without so much of the colorful language, and the bodice-ripper sex ... not really what I like to read... but overall was a pretty good story."
4,kept my interest,"I'm really wishing I could give 3.5 stars. I don't read a lot of romance books, so I'm not very familiar with how they are usually plotted out. I really liked the first 3/4's of the book. I liked the story, I liked the charaters, but then the whole book seemed to change gears. It went from a nice little story to torid love scenes. I didn't feel that there was enough transition from flirty to bodice ripping, and it jarred me. The ending was, for me, a little to neat. The villians were a little to unknown. I would have liked more from them. I liked the story and it did pull me in from the get-go."
1,Hideous,OK for a kindergarten class but not much more. I was going to submit photos but not worth the time. They are obviously made by blind people (no disrespect) as you have to take scissors and cut them to shape before you use them. I struggle to use them even for the intended disposable purpose.
2,Really poor quality.,I have purchased disposable type brush kits in the past and this set was not even close to what I purchased before. The bristles are cut very irregularly.
1,Not worth the money!!,Maybe they could be used in an elementary school by kids - but not in a man's workshop!! A waste of money!
5,Groundbreaking theology,"A Roman Catholic theologian who has delved into the deep, deep works of Charles Sanders Peirce deserves to be read, and this book certainly does. It is a big first step toward making sense of the American experience without having to fall back on Euro-centric theological/philosophical traditions as a basis for thought.Charles Sanders Peirce's work is seminal and original, and thus has been largely ignored. Not by Father Garcia-Rivera, however, and not by Louis Menand, whose wonderful book, ""The Metaphysical club,"" provides an excellent overview of Peirce's work (and tragic life) and places him in the context of other leading American intellectuals of the late 19th century. The fact that Peirce's work stands head and shoulders above all the others validates to my mind Father Garcia-Rivera's groundbreaking enterprise."
5,Perfect for Product Photography,"After numerous internet reviews, I decided on this tripod for use with my in-home product photography - (i.e. still photos for uses such as posting on blogs and ebay...)I was looking for a short, small tripod for taking photo's in a photo tent to post on my blog. This tripod is small - perfect size, very very sturdy. I use it to home my canon rebel xti. I am not using the tripod to travel or to use outside of my home studio - but I think it would accommidate me well if I chose to.If you are looking for a very sturdy, compact folding tripod I recommend this one. It is sturdy enough that even if I don't use my camera remote, my camera remains stable.As always, I am pleased with my Amazon purchase and service.***Before buying products, I recommend researching the product and its direct uses to ensure your purchase will fulfill your expectations. I used outside searches and product reviews before deciding on this product. I was not disappointed."
5,Nice to use,"I currently own about eight tabletop tripods, they range in price from seven dollars to two hundred dollars each. All my photography is macro work; photographing jewellery. I bought this tripod not because I needed yet another tripod, I bought it because all my existing tripods are in storage, and rather than claw my way through box upon box looking for a tripod, I bought this because 1: it's the right size, 2: It's cheap, and 3: If it's rubbish, then I haven'y lost much. Well....it certainly isn't rubbish, infact, it's an excellent little tripod, well made, well put together, and most importantly - it is very sturdy, even without using a shutter release I can shoot at 1/4 of a sec with absolutely no blurry. The head that came with it is okay, but if you're intending to do a lot of close-up work, buy this tripod and invest in a good ball-head. This really does put some of my more expensive tripods to shame. Nice product, well worth the money."
3,Good value - Wrong picture!,"The Amazon page photo is of the VS34 tripod with the ball head, not the VS30, which as described has a tilting pan-head, but no ball. The legs are metal, but the pan-head is plasic, so has some flex to it.If you like the picture, look for the VS34.In any case this is a great value. The design is much like the Leitz tabletop tripod that I've had for 40 years, and that's still my favorite. However, the Leitz is now something like $110 for the legs and $330 for the ball head. (When I bought mine in the '60s it was $10.50 and $33.00 - factor of 10 cheaper!)The VS30 is very low to the surface, which is why I bought this to supplement my Leitz. Great for macro-photography, especially with a right-angle finder for your camera. With a ball head attached also makes a nice chest-pod for steadier hand-held shots."
1,shE lookEd ReAL,I used to like Barbies.But now I hate them!!!!!!No wonder Bratz fan always say they have big boobs and they do!!!!!How stupid is her name.Summer or in Malay musim panas.Musim is season.Panas is hot=Summer (I know u guys doesn't learn Bahasa Melayu at school).I prefer My Scene.They are worth of money and cool.Bratz is way cooler than Barbies.Fashion Fever Barbies are nice.P\S My Scene is always number one.My Scene Cool.And Barbie is not cool (Yuck)Farah Sazwanie
2,Way too small and cheaply made,Way too small and cheaply made to be functional. The paperclip gate started failing after 4 times opening and closing.
1,Quick-Release Key Ring,It looks way bigger than it actually is; it is so small and is of no use to me. I really thought they were a regular size but the picture fooled me.
4,"Love this item, wish shipping was a little cheaper.",I've bought quite of few of these in silver. They're great. I wish the shipping wasn't so much here though. More than four dollars is a lot for something so small. I believe shipping is cheaper directly from Photon.
2,quick release key ring,"keychain was tiny. Much smaller then what I expected. I ended up just throwing it in the trash, don't wast your time"
3,Good size,"Good size, but they are hard to remove from a keyring. These rings are very handy. My wife wants a bigger size because these are too small for her."
5,Great!,Best quick release on Amazon. Small but strong quality and easy release. Some others in Amazon are not as great but this is just what I was looking for to hook up my usb to the rest of my keys.
3,too small for normal use,"I agree with the reviewer who said this was a small ring, but I did not think it was THAT SMALL until I actually received it. The entire thing is just slightly bigger than a DIME and about half the size of a QUARTER. That should give you some idea.I had difficulty puttin on my Honda Oddesey's car key because this key ring is too small.Hope they will update the specs with actual dimensions."
3,Small but okay,"This item is much smaller than I thought according to the way it appeared on Amazon. While it does seem durable, the clip part is small. I don't think it would work well for someone with big fingers, especially if they were planning to clip it on and off daily. But other than that it is inexpensive."
4,Happy with key ring,"I needed a key ring which would allow me to detach a second ring of keys a couple times a day. This ring fits that requirement very well. I was a little disappointed in the small size which makes it a little difficult to open the latch. On the other hand, the total bundle of keys/keyring is that much smaller. I'm happy."
1,Night + Day is a BIG let down.,"I love new age music. I bought Night + Day thinking it would be a good CD in my collection, but it was a real disapointment. It is so bad it made me cry. I had to put it out with the trash."
1,I was quite disappointed with the total 'locomotive' sound.,This song was a bit disappointing and I do not believe that this song would go down very well in an 'underground house' club.
4,probably the best face-care pad out there,"I don't particularly love face-care pads; I'd far rather just use face wash and lotion, but these pads do fill a gap in my routine. I use these anytime my face is sweaty or dirty throughout the day, like after exercise or just a hot day in the sun. It tides me over well until I can actually wash my face. I also use them at night, after washing my face, to help clear out excess oil and dirt the gentle cleanser may have missed. These can be a bit drying though, so I've cut down on my use of the pads during my night routine since winter started. I use these every other night or less. Doesn't seem to make a difference if I use them during the day or not, as far as skin-drying goes.I'm a big fan of Neutrogena products, and these pads are definitely world's ahead of the other two acne-care face pads I've used before. If you like cleanser cloths, you should give these a try, particularly if you have skin that tends to be more oily than dry."
2,It doesn't work and I've used almost all of them,It makes my face red and dry and it simply doesn't work for me. I've used almost all of the container. I'm really disappointed because I love Neutrogena but this product simply doesn't work.
2,Don't hate it but I don't like it.,"This stuff doesn't do anything for me. I have probably used about 40/60 of the wipes, and I've been waiting for results that are just not going to come. First of all, I have very annoying, acne prone skin. It's oily on the t-zone, but is very dry on the cheeks. So I guess it would be called ""combination skin."" I don't have very bad acne, but I do have bumpy, un-smooth skin, with a couple of pimples at a time. When I started using this I loved the convenience of it, so of course I was praying it would work for me. Daily, I'd get out of the shower, quickly take a pad, rub all over my face, apply lotion, then be done and moving on to other things. But that's about the only thing I can say I really like about this. It just doesn't work for me at all."
3,Watch out if you have perfume sensitivities,"I just started using these, so I can't comment on how quickly they work yet. They don't seem overly drying and they don't sting -- I've used a lot of Neutrogena acne products, and none of them have stung or really dried out my skin. The only issue I see forming is that the fragrance is really amazingly strong. If you have perfume sensitivities, remember this is going to go on your face very close to your nose. It's strong enough that I might actually choose another wash or cream once I use up the jars I got. EDIT: I'm returning these. The perfume smell is just too much and won't even wash off. Yikes."
5,A moving book,"As a newcomer to the US, I am perhaps more aware of the role of race here than I am in the UK. However, despite living here 2 years, was still at a loss a loss as to its' origins and why it occured here.This book helped me see the American ""South"" in a new light. Gone are my perceptions that large sections of the old confederate south are your typical ""KKK style bigots"", but it has been replaced with a recognition that the racism that the African-American community experienced may well still be there.Sure the burning crosses are gone but the ""racism of the mind"", the unspoken racism that most people are too ashamed to raise but which must still be presents among some, both in the North and in the South, is still very much alive and well in the US."
1,A good book is in here . . . somewhere,"The obvious problem with this book is that it wasn't edited at all. Mr. Hendrickson attempted to write with style, grace and Faulknerian passages. Instead, we get overly grotesque physical descriptions and biased portraits of biased men.Just when the writing starts to get to the facts of the matter, we get line after line after line after line (well you get the idea) of superfluous, novellic, beautiful, cloying prose. This is NOT a novel, Mr. Hendrickson! It was meant to be study in non-fiction.If more of the disjointed ""literary"" passages were deleted, more attention was paid to the facts, and the author made a decent attempt to be unbiased, this book would be a five start book.You write very well, Mr. Hendrickson, but please get a better editor."
3,"Responding to ""Don from New York, NY""","Sir, I am also a New Yorker. I take issue with your assumption that someone writing a review with which you do not agree is a bigot, and further, that the bigot in question is a Southerner.P.S. ""Southerner"" is a proper noun and should be capitalized.Amazon, please remove or edit ""Don's"" offensive review."
4,This book show me my lackings,But it is not good for explain themes(eg. reference types o arrays). You must to consult other books for more complete explanations. But this book is very necesary like guide to you must to known. It is essential.
3,Wasn't what I was looking for...,"I was hoping for something that'd give me information about what I needed to know to pass the exam, this book does that, but also goes into the how's and whys. I would have been more useful for me to have that information separated, allowing me to look that up when needed and not get bogged down with prose. Still a good book, but heavy to get through if you're already familiar with most of the concepts."
5,Best for java 1.4,"I started to use java since its beginning, three years ago, I used this book's first edition <<A Programmer's Guide to Java (tm) Certification>> to pass my SCJP1.2...I really learnt a lot from this book and I rated it as the best one at that time.Now I passed SCJD, SCWCD and SCEA and became java architect in my company... I think the book gave me solid java foundation.I am glad to see its second edition out, it is more focus on the current SCJP certification, and contains a CD of SCPJ2 1.4 Exam Simulator developed by Whizlabs Software, which includes several mock exams and simulates the exam-taking experience. It explains common pitfalls in detail. I admit that after lots of year's java experience, I still learn a lot from the second edition of this book, which is even deeper than its previous edition.Wish other readers enjoy this book as well.Daniel"
5,Excellent for SCJP Exam (even SCJP 5),"This is a great book to prepare for the SCJP exams. The pity is that it was designed for SCJP 1.4. But where the subject matter for SCJP 5 is the same as for SCJP 1.4 I find this book better than the Sierra/Bates book. The discussion is very complete and thorough. Very good discussion of nested classes, threads, etc. But you need the S/B book for generics and the newer stuff."
4,This book passes the test because I did.,"This book definately helped me pass the test. It is very understandable, thorough and has good examples, questions and assignments. Its a very good book overall. The practice test has a few errors if you take it out of the book. For some reason I was expecting the practice test in the book and the test included on the CD to be different so I did the book test first. I would have liked them to have been different so that I had more practice. I suggest that the test on the cd be taken so as to simulate the actually test environment. One thing I felt was not explained well enough was overriding the hashcode() method. This is only a minor gripe though and that subject may only come up in 1 or 2 out of 61 questions."
3,A Native Arts Coloring book,"Designed and written as a child's coloring book, this gives a good overview of the symbology and importance to the Pacific North West Indians of each of the animals selected to ""color"" in. The legend in the front of the book explains the color scheme(s) and provides an outline of each animal on the following pages for a child to color. It gives wonderful examples of the artwork for a child to learn a bit about these symbols. However; if you are looking for an in-depth analysis of the symbology of the Northwest Indian arts or a ""how-to"" book, this would not be a good book for you. I wish I had known this was a ""coloring book"" before I bought it as I would have passed it over for something more detailed!"
5,Pure olive oil soap,"I typically buy the soap in Syria. However, with the recent troubles (so sad) it is a bit difficult to get there. The supplier sells the exact same products you find in Syria. So the quality is excellent. The smell, texture and skin sensation of the soap is superb. I like it.Since I sweat a lot my skin requires good moisturizing. I believe this soap does a good job to keep my skin as healthy as when I was born."
4,Been in love for years,"I've loved this album since I first heard it many years ago. It was lovely to hear it again after so long. Yes, there are some sound glitches on it - but it is a live recording. Microphone squeal adds to the ""you are here"" experience! Carpet of the Sun will make any day brighter."
4,Musical marriage made in heaven? Indeed!,"Fun and interesting listening! Most successful prog-rock endeavor. Unlike some other prog-rock orchestrations in which the arrangements seemed ""pasted on"", the orchestral arrangements here intensify the mystical, apocalyptic and Blake-like poetry/lyrics of Betty Thatcher. I give this 4 stars, but only because recently I heard the ""BBC Sessions"", sans orchestra, thereby allowing me to focus better on Annie's technically astounding and tastefully expressive singing and the band's virtuostic playing. (Preferring apples to oranges, perhaps?)"
1,Not up to the task,I purchased this unit as a supplemental heat source for a small bedroom. It was unable to warm the room and ran constantly because the heater was never able to reach the temperature necessary for the thermostat to shut it off. It only works if you sit close to it.
3,Good for the right purpose,"This heater works great to warm up a cold room gradually and maintain a temperature. It is not a high heat output unit that works like you are warming your hands over a fire. Turning the thermostat up does not produce more heat it just makes it run longer until it reaches that temperature before it cycles off.The best uses I have found for it are keeping my large garage warm in the winter when I need to bring plants in during a freeze and on winter camping trips where I can run an extension cord to a power source. In both cases I only want to raise the temperature to a reasonable point, not be able to run around in a bathing suit.The thermostat and tip safety switch are my favorite features."
3,Explanation from the Jim Henson Company,"I'm one of the many people who loved the original but was really disappointed with the VHS/DVD releases. This is the response I got from the JimHenson Company:""It is true that the recorded release of ""A Muppet Family Christmas."" is shorter than the broadcast special. The original agreement that was made for the music of this special was for broadcast television only. Subsequently, when we tried to arrange for the home video we were not allowed to release it unless certain selections were removed. This situation remains unchanged.""My suggestion, like others, would be to find somebody who has a good copy of the original. (Let me know if you do! My copy is getting a little old...)"
2,Big Disapointment,"I cannot believe Henson Co. allowed a heavily edited version to go to DVD. Usually a DVD has ADDED content. Not this one. Among other edits they removed an entire musical number(Sleigh Ride) which also has needed elements to advance the plot (Fozzy and Snowman). Nowhere on the DVD are we warned that pieces of the original program are missing. By saying it is digitally Mastered it is misleads one to assume they are using the original Master tape. Not so. We were so excited to see this available on a clean DVD, so it is with great emotion that we were disapointed upon viewing."
2,Thank goodness for online reviews,"I am so glad that I decided to read the reviews before buying this video. I have seen this movie more time then I can remember. The copy I have right now is taped off of the t.v. from many years ago. When I saw this video on here I was going to buy it right away. After reading the other reviews containing information about editing cuts, I think that I will continue watching my old copy. Commercials are better than missing great parts of the movie. I give this one two stars, and the original, uncut movie five"
4,Okay,This is one of my favorite movies as a child and I was psyched to find it on DVD. The only down side is that it is missing 3 scenes from the original broadcast and with these scenes missing it doesn't always flow right or make sense. I contacted the Jim Henson company and they would not or could not do anything about it. Otherwise a great Muppet movie.
3,Fun For Christmas,"If you're after a warm-hearted story which is essentially the Muppets singing Christmas carols around a basic plot then MUPPET FAMILY CHRISTMAS should be on your ""To Buy"" list.The whole cast are here: the Muppets, the Sesame Street gang and the Fraggles. Several Holiday classics are in this movie, as well as many old carols - the movie culminates in an entertaining sing-a-long with the entire band of Muppets.MUPPET FAMILY CHRISTMAS will please the audience it's aimed at - kids. They'll have great fun watching how the Muppets spend the Yuletide season. Adults however will be able to watch alongside without getting bored: it's the fact that the Muppets are so watchable that reaps benefits for this movie."
1,Want the original!,"I have been trying to find this movie for 2 years. After reading the reviews of the DVD, I realize I want the original movie. To ""Meggie"", I would love to have a copy of your original. Please let me know how to reach you. I am new to all this and don't know how to email you. Thanks!"
2,Please someone respond and help!!!!,"There sre so many of us that are suffering without a copy of the unedited version of mupp. fam. christmas we remember as children....... i beg for one of you out there that owns such a copy please please please make a copy and sell it so i can pass it on to the rest of us, i will pay whatever u want, vhs, beta, dvd, dont care i need to find this before its too late...ANYONE???? please respond!!!"
2,Original Wanted!!!,I'm glad to have read everyone's reviews that the DVD is not the original! I too had the original on tape (with the oldies commericals!) and the tape BROKE from watching it so much. Now I'm out to find the ORIGINAL version as a gift to my sisters. (...) Thank you!!!
3,What is the difference?,Can anyone tell me what the big difference is regarding price for this DVD? I see it anywhere from 10 dollars to 150 dollars. My son loves this Christmas show and I would like to purchase but i am confused as to what the differences are. Any information would be helpful. Thanks
1,Disappointment,"I LOVED this movie growing up... my parents taped it, along with many other christmas specials, off the tv (so when watched..you get to see all those familiar 80's commercials). I bought this movie so excited that I didnt have to search the Christmas special tape for this one movie! Well,when I watched it I started to sing along with some of my favorite songs, and surpirse suprise!!! I was the only one siging because they had left alot of the songs out!! It was made even worse when you could actually tell where the cuts were made even if youve never seen it before! I was so disappointed!!! I'm just going to copy my parent's tape so I dont have to be disappointed every time I see the Muppet Family Christmas Special (Even if it has to mean watching the squiggly lines and 80's commercials)."
3,They Blew It!,"I taped the original broadcast, and after watching it for many years, decided to buy a ""real"" tape of the program. I was very upset and disappointed to find they had cut what I considered some of the best parts of the film - and didn't even do a clean job of it. I do not recommend this to anyone who loves the original."
1,Where are the best parts?,"My family loves the Muppet Family Christmas, but this DVD leaves out our favorite parts. Find the original and forget this chopped up version."
1,A Tragic Release For a Wonderful Christmas Tradition,"Every Christmas since I was little, my family has made it a tradition to watch this classic. We were all very excited to hear it was coming out on DVD, but when we got it, we were upset to say the least. We could not believe that such classic scenes were deleted. How could they have taken out Fozzy with the snowman??? I understand that there are legal issues the company has, but I know most people would have been happy to pay a little more to get this special in its entirety. I believe you should do yourself a favor and get a hold of someone that has a good copy of this and ask them to make you a copy. You will be much happier with the commercials then with the terrible editing."
3,Jipped,"I love this movie. It has always and will always be my favorite Christmas movie. I recorded it from t.v. when it first came on in the 80's. In about 1994, my mom recorded over it. I was so mad! I haven't seen it since until I bought it on Amazon.com. I received it yesterday and watched it immediately. As the movie went on, I began to notice strange things. Parts of the movie had been removed! I felt let down. My advice is to be careful when you buy something."
2,Disappointing edited version...,"I was ecstatic to find out that this movie is available on DVD. Unfortunately after I watched it I was confused and disappointed. My favorite scene from childhood, Miss Piggy slipping on the icy patch, is not included!! Neither was my favorite song, ""There's no place like home for the holidays.."" The movie is significantly lacking without these memorable scenes. It's still nice to have on DVD, but a recorded from TV version is a necessary supplement."
1,Missing key scenes,"As other people have stated, I'm lucky enough to have the original version taped when it aired on TV. This tape isn't in the gratest condition anymore, so a couple years ago we purchased the VHS version and were very disappointed. Many people mentioned the missing scenes, but I didn't see anyone mention that because of this, a key part of the story line is missing. In the edited version, you don't have any idea why Fozzie is excited about his new act. The ""sleigh ride"" scene, with its series of jokes, explains why he's so excited. I was just checking the reviews to see if this was ""fixed"" in the DVD, and evidently it wasn't, so I won't be buying that version either."
3,What happened to this DVD?,"I was very disappointed in the DVD version of a timeless classic. In DVD there is no restriction on time or length, but somehow Jim Henson Production failed to include several musical numbers, 4 by my count. I have an old copy of this that was taped off television back in the late 80's, and I could not believe that it had been butchered. Most of the missing sections are obvious, because there is choppy scene switching, and someone who had never seen it before, would have been very confused about how Fozzy and the Snowman became comedic partners. This rates as 3 stars, not because the DVD itself was bad, but the decisions of some executives to leave out scenes that made this classic very special to me, as part of my youth. I wish I had read the on-line reviews before purchasing this DVD."
5,A must have for all muppet fans,This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. I am now 19 years old and still watch it every year. Not only does it have the regular muppets but the Fraggles and Seseme Street guys are in it too. You even get to see movies of the baby muppets. The whole gang end up at Fozzi's mom's farm house. There is lots of singing and they all learn the true meaning of christmas.
2,Beta is still the best,"I have been waiting and watching for this TV special to be released in its full origional version forever (so it seems). After nine years of waiting after the VHS version was released, it's not looking good. However, I was smart enough to tape the first run on TV with my Sony Beta-Max, without commercials. The cuts are a little ragged but to this day the quality is still as crisp and sharp as the day I taped it. Even though I am an old f, (Ah, I ment Senior Citizen)it's still one of my favorite Christmas specials, one that puts our family in the ""holiday spirit"". Like everyone else who remembers the full origional version, I hope that someday it is restored. Still, the edited DVD version does pass along the ""flavor"" and ""spirit"" that is the Muppet's trademark. So all things considered it's better then nothing."
3,Missing Scenes!,I have an original copy of the movie recorded to VHS from when it aired on TV in the 80's and noticed that 2 scenes were deleted on the DVD version. Die hard fans be aware.
2,A Muppet Family Christmas,"I wish I had read the other customer reviews before I purchased this video. I can't believe how they chopped up what I consider one of the best Christmas specials ever made. Next time, I'll make sure I'm getting the whole show before I buy. What a disappointment!"
5,A Muppets Family Christmas,I loved this one so much that I taped it from the TV show. Having the DVD is so much better. It is funny and heartwarming.
3,A Muppet Family Christmas,"We loved the original version of this movie, but were disappointed to find out that they had cut several of the most adorable scences.Usually, dvd's have additional material and footage, but this one had less than the original on vhs!"
3,"Kris from Brookline, MA","Hey Kris,I would love a copy of your DVD that you have put together! Place it on E-Bay under the title ""Real Muppets Christmas"" and I will find you there!!Hope this gets to you,PhiChitown"
1,I've got the original version!!,"While this had always been my favorite muppet movie, the missing scenes made this tape almost worthless. I found the original, taped from tv version at my parents house and it's in excellent shape, considering it was taped in 1988. It has the Fozzy and snowman song, sleighride, the muppet babies song, Santa CLaus is coming to town, Kermit and Miss Piggy singing, Have Yourself a Merry little Christmas, and Miss Piggy singing, there's no place like home for the holidays. If anyone is dying for the original, just email me for a copy. If you are a true muppet fan, you will be able to tell the difference.clarkeinvestigations@hotmail.com"
3,I've got the original version!,"While this had always been my favorite muppet movie, the missing scenes made this tape almost worthless. I found the original, taped from tv version at my parents house and it's in excellent shape. It has the Fozzy and snowman song, sleighride, the muppet babies song, Santa CLaus is coming to town, Kermit and Miss Piggy singing, Have Yourself a Merry little Christmas, and Miss Piggy singing, there's no place like home for the holidays. If anyone is dying for the original, just email me for a copy. If you are a true muppet fan, you will be able to tell the difference.clarkeinvestigations@hotmail.com"
2,A Muppet Family Christmas,"I wish I took the time to read the reviews before buying this DVD. My family loved this TV special and we have watched it over and over from a tape we made from the TV. I thought my family would be delighted to have a high quality DVD to watch and share with others, but we were all very disappointed when we found out that several scenes were deleted. Jim Henson, is someone that I held in high esteem, I can't believe his production company would do just a poor job of producing this DVD. I can't help but feel ripped-off."
2,Editing Sucks,"The original version of this deserves a full 5 stars--it's warm, inviting, and incredibly fun with appearances from nearly every muppet created from Fraggles, Muppet Show and Sesame Street. HOWEVER, this version only gets 1 star because whoever released this thing has edited a full 15 - 20 minutes out of it. IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN EDITED! In comparison to the original, this version is too jumpy, leaves out entire character developments and funny scenes. The original's pacing allows you to settle into the house with everyone and see how they mix. The pacing of this video barely gives you the flavor. This video version is like being forced to chug your hot cocoa before you can enjoy it."
1,Why the cuts?,"I, like many of the other reviewers, have had an ancient copy of this show recorded from TV. When I bought this video I was excited to have a ""complete"" copy. Imagine my horror that, within the first 15 minutes of the start, the editting had begun! If you have never seen this show before then I think you will love it. BUT, if you have loved and watched the original cut for the last 13 or so years you will be very disappointed."
1,CUT TO PIECES!!!,how could you ruin a worldwide favorite like this???every major enjoyable scene has been cut from this. the scene of fozzy doing standup with the snowman was my favorite memory of this special. WHY IS THERE NO DVD VERSION OF THE TELEVISION SPECIAL? WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO CUT THIS TO PIECES!?!?for the record... this is blasphemy and jim henson is rolling over in his grave.
1,Have to add my one star,I agree with everyone else on the page. I felt shortchanged whn I watched this for the first time because of all the missing scenes. Whoever would chop up a Muppet special doesn't deserve my money.
4,thanks for the info.,"I appreciated all the reviews by people who have bought this video recently, especially the information regarding the edits of the original. Our problem is, we have taped over the original!! So we have no other options here. My boys (11 and 15) say this is their all-time favorite Christmas movie, so we are buying it anyway (cut or not), and I am just hopeful since it's been so long that we won't notice the editing."
4,memories,Brings back the past Christmas seasons when my children and I would watch it. We all loved it. Great memories.
4,Muppet Family Christmas movie,"Great Muppet Christmas movie with all of Jim Henson's characters. My children enjoyed seeing the gang from Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and The Muppets all in one movie."
4,"Even though parts are missing, it is still a delight!","I too have searched for this and didn't buy it for a long time due to the reviews about what was missing. Well, I decided to buy it to show my now grown up kids and I am glad I did. It is still delightful, fun, and worth watching. Of course I would like to see the entire show, but understand the legalities as explained by one reviewer. Maybe someday it will be resolved, but until then, we enjoyed it very much anyway!"
3,Like It But Will Only Buy Non-edited Tape or DVD!!,I loved this Christmas special it was so cute and I really enjoyed the songs especially We Need A Little Christmas which was the first time I had ever heard the song and is now one of my favorites. I wanted to buy the video or DVD for This Muppets Christmas special but I'm a little disappointed that scenes were cut out so I rate this a 3 because it has been edited but if it hadn't been edited I would rate it a 5.
4,gotta love a muppet,if you have an ounce of muppet love - you'll love this muppet family christmas. in usual muppet style - they're irreverent & charming at once. they capture holiday magic w. concern for family & friends. it is one of our family's favorites - there is really no need to grow up
3,The best parts missing...,"I found this tape just the other day and immediatly purchased it, took it home and watched it. I do wish I had come here first. Although it's still the best Christmas special ever, I agree with all those who were disappointed: the best parts are missing. The part I miss the most is when Miss Piggy finally gets to the farmhouse and is making her big entrance, only to slip on the icy patch--with the entire muppet cast giving her the belated warning of ""careful of the icy patch!"""
3,piglet,As of last year I wrote an email in on the same issue as everyone else and never got any feedback on why they did what they did. I was even more disappointted that they are still selling the cut version when this was brought to their attention and the fact they don't seem to be airing the full version on any channel. Are we ever going to get to see the whole thing in fullness or own it. Thank you
1,Good video but major scenes are missing from the original.,"This is a very enjoyable holiday video with lots of singing and plenty of their famous vaudevillian humor. The problem with this tape, however, is that the version I received is missing several scenes that were on the original airing. If you are interested in this video because you have enjoyed it previously on television, do not buy this. You will be greatly disappointed as we were."
1,rating the item for sale -- not the unedited version!,"this definately should not have been released as it was. a lot of people are rating this 5 stars mostly because they remember the orginal airing on TV when the WHOLE movie was shown. this hacked up version that is the item for sale here gets a rating of 1. of course, if it were unedited (as all personal DVD/VHS should be) it would receive a rating of 5. why should one be able to watch the uncut version for free on TV, then pay for a lesser version? that is unacceptable. people need to realize that they are rating the product, and this one is no good."
4,"Uneditted version available for sale in ""region 2""","If you are looking for an uneditted version of Muppet Family Christmas, you can find it for sale on amazon.co.uk, as the film was released uneditted in region 2 (UK) a few years ago. Even better, many of the vendures are willing to ship internationally. I found the DVD and shipping for around $30-40 total. Awesome! The only glitch is that you MUST have a DVD player compatible to play region 2 discs... be sure about this before you purchase the movie or you may be stuck unable to watch it!"
3,Wish I had read the other reviews before purchase,"I have been looking for this video for a few years. It was out there but much too expensive and most of the time not in dvd format. When I saw this one, I was so excited and I bought two for my kids. After the fact, I read reviews from other people who bought this and unfortunately, there are scenes missing. Important scenes!!! Just a warning....Before you buy, Read the reviews!!"
1,I wont be buying the DVD of this favorite Christmas movie,"I came to Amazon a few weeks ago in order to buy the DVD version of Muppets Family Christmas for my grandsons. Its been a family fave of ours for 20 years now. Imagine my surprise when I saw the price of it! That alone was enough to deter me and then I read the reviews and saw that several of the best parts of this movie had been edited out.Whats the point in spending almost $200 when it isnt even the original movie?Amazon: A word of advice here. Dont bother trying to sell this movie at such an exorbitant price and then let people know that key parts have been edited due to something as stupid and trivial as ""production rights"".I still have my original VHS tape and will continue to watch that with my grandsons until the powers that be grow up and stop penalizing the viewing public for something we have absolutely no control over."
1,Muppet Family Christmas,Allie from canada..I would love to get an unedited version of the movie... How do I get in contact with you? I would pay for all costs. If you are unable to... is there anyone who can? Lisa
1,desperately searching for an original,I too saw the original - and had a tape til someone taped over most of the show. I am willing to pay for an origianl copy - for a Christmas gift to my teenage children who still love it!
1,Searching for original copy!!!!!!,"I am glad to see the reviews on this movie before I bought it. I was interested to see that some people still have their originals. If anyone would be willing to make my a copy (especially with original commercials), I will gladly pay for it. If anyone is able to do this, (...)."
1,Does anyone have the original??,"I am looking for the original uncut version of this movie. I work with kids and wanted to let them watch one of my FAVORITE Christmas movies, but am disappointed to hear that the version being sold on this site has been edited. If anyone has a good copy of the original and could send me a copy please email me! [...]Thanks!!"
1,How Do I get a copy?,"I was planning on buying the DVD, but after I saw all the reviews saying that there are missing scenes, I was wondering how I could contact someone with the original copy. I would pay for shipping and the cost of making the copy, if anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.Ian"
4,this is a great double stroller,"I absolutely love this stroller. I am the mother of a 2 year old and a 3 month old. I had such a struggle picking out a stroller but I read the reviews on the duoglider and they sounded really promising. I have to say that I was surprised at the ease of this stroller. It feels like I am pushing a single stroller, it manuevers very well and it folds so compact that if fits easily in the trunk of a car. If you are in the market for a double stroller give this one a good look. LL,NY"
5,Very pleased with this purchase,"Bought this product because I have a 23 month old and we are expecting another baby in November. Had it put together in less then ten minutes.Quality of product is excellent. Compared this product with several others before purchasing. The price for it was competitive, considering it comes with the child carrier and base for car. Both seats recline on stroller. Footstools for both children. Tray tables optional for both children. Parent tray does not get in the way when you try to close it. Nice parent tray as well! LARGE deep place under stroller to store stuff.Color and pattern conservative and nice.One hand close.Easy to maneuver. Could not be happier with this stroller"
5,perfect for 2 little ones,I bought this stroller when my older son was just about 3 and my new son was born. I knew that my older guy would be jealous if we only had a one seat stroller....and he gets tired on long walks. My older son loves it.....we used it with the infant seat and now that my newborn is 10 months he can just get buckled into the back. They both love it..its SO easy to use. I drive a huge SUV so storage in my trunk is a non-issue. But it does fit well into the back of my husbands 2 door car. Its very easy to push...and manuevers very well. Its also comfortable for me to push- I'm 5'8 and my husband is 6'. I would recommend this to anyone.....its a must have!
3,It's ... UMMM... okay...?,"I bought this stoller after researching double strollers for several months. At the time my children were 15 months and newborn. It was okay than and it is less than okay now. I am looking into side-by-sides. The car seat fit fine into it, but then my 15 month old daughter could not put her seat back at all. Now, my son sits up and pulls his sisters hair and kicks her seat. If I put anything into the basket, then it drags and has a lot of wear on the bottom of it. I am extremly disappointed in this stroller. With my first baby I had a Graco travel system and I could not say enough bad thngs about that one either. All my Graco products (and trust me throughout both children I have had several) have been a huge let down. I am looking that the Combi and McClaren double strollers. They both fit car seats which was one of my key selling points. Now my daughter is 2 and my son is a year."
3,Not the Best!,"I purchased this stroller for a number of reasons.1. Infant carseat goes in it2. Cup holder for mom and kiddos3. The colors4. Huge storageWell come to find out this stroller does not work well with heavy kids. Esp if the heavier one wants to be in the front. Also, the back child can pull the front child's hair. It cannot be steered with one hand at all. It is heavy to put in the car. I just don't like it! I'm selling and getting something else.I think the stroller could be made better for the money you spend on it."
2,awful stroller,"there are many features i don't like about this stroller, everytime i take it out of the car the front canopy falls off and is very difficult to get back on...it drives me nuts, also it hardly fits in the back of my jeep..you would think for the amount it costs it would be a better product"
5,A twin must!,"This stroller is absolutely great for twins! My twins are 9 months old now and I'm glad I didn't buy the side by side stroller. I go everywhere with my babies. People were amazed how I was out and about. But it was easy with this stroller. It is a smooth ride, easy transition from car to stroller and the car seats just snap in. I especially like how I do not have to take them out of their car seats. They stay nice and snug. It also folds quick and easily. When you have the children in their car seats it makes it very difficult to get to the bottom basket. What I did was hung my diaper bag on the handle bar. Easy fix. A great buy for me!"
3,good option for twins with a few flaws,"We have the single Graco travel system for our 2-year old and had no complaints. This stroller is a neccesity for twins for a couple of reasons: it holds 2 infant seats, it has lots of storage and you can completely cover both babies (important to shield new babies from nosy people). That said there are a few things that are very annoying: it is difficult to get the lock to catch when you fold it up, the front sun canopy constantly comes off and is a PAIN to get back on, the ""mommy"" cup holder is unusable unless the back canopy is extended, the back carrier always gets caught on the canopy and you can't strap in the back baby without removing that carrier. I don't know of a better option for the price, but I am looking for a lighter side-by-side stroller once the twins are out of the carriers."
5,Excellent Stroller for twins!,"I loved my stroller! I have b/g twins and this was great! It was easy to turn, open and close. I had the snap in car seats and they were east to put in and take out! It was a smooth ride for my babies! It helped me through all my first year twins needs. I never had any problems with it. I was able to put it together without screaming!!!It can be a bit pricey but is very well worth the $$! I did have one item break but I called Graco and they sent it to me for free! They didn't give me any problems and no questions. My stroller now belongs to another mommy of twins! She loves it too!"
4,Life saver!,This system saved me! I have a 3 week old and a 23 month old. My parents bought this for us. I works perfectly. My 23 month old loves that he sits up front and able to see the world! The stadium seating will be nice for when the youngest gets older. The only thing I would change is where the cup holders are located and that it be a bit lighter. But what can you expect it is a double stroller.
4,Great Product,"I bought this item as a gift and my friend was very pleased. I thought it was a great value as well. My only issue is with the shipping. Babie's R Us, shipped it very quick but the fee they charge for shipping is very expensive. This is the second time I have have bought something from them and had it shipped and both times the fees were way too high. If I could have gone to the store myself, I would not have purchased the gift online."
4,LIFESAVER FOR TWINS,"I am a mother of 6 mo. identical twin boys and while pregnant, my husband and I were looking for a stroller that would fit two infant carseats on it. This was it! We found no other stroller like it and it already came with one infant carrier with base, so we only had to buy one infant carseat. When we would go out, putting both of them in the stroller while in their infant carriers was so much more convenient than carrying their carriers ourselves. Now they are older and they still like it. I like the cupholders for me and them and the detachable cupholder trays for them are convenient also. However, it is a bit pricey and it's not that good over rough ground and it does take up quite a bit of trunk space. It is heavy, but it folds up pretty easily and when the back seat is reclined all the way, it is hard to reach the basket underneath, but hey what stroller is actually perfect? Overall, it is a great investment to make for twins."
5,Great double stroller,"I shopped around for the best double stroller. This one is perfect. You have enough storage on the bottom and many gadgets on the strolller for keys, cell phone etc....My two year loves it. He is also able to reline back even with the car seat attached on the back. Easy to fold and store in your vehicle. THe stroller is very easy to shop with at the mall. You can move it with only one hand. Great stroller. Vey happy with it."
4,Great for Twins!,"This stroller is great! I read the other reviews and understand their frustrations but overall its a great stroller. Once you get the hang of opening and closing it, its pretty simple (not brain surgery). I have twins and the infant car seats just click right in. No hassles. If I had to make one complaint, it would be the cup holder. When you have an infant in the back seat the umbrella covers the cup holder but not a huge deal in my book. I love that it turns on a dime (especially great in stores that are tight fitting with racks everywhere). And I love that both the infant car seats face back towards me so I can see them.Overall...It's pretty cool for a stroller!"
1,poor product,"I bought this stroller 4 months ago and the wheel comes off all the time. When I called Graco they sent me replacment parts but that did not help, the wheel still comes off and the stroller almost flips over when it happens. Some other problems with the stroller is you cannot get in the basket if the infant carrier is being used because the basket does not lower, and the front sun shade pops off every time you use the stroller and is very hard to get back on. I have several friends that have this stroller and none of them can use the sun shade because it is to hard to put back on.I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone. Graco is not very helpful either when you complain."
4,Lifesaver!,"I love my stroller! I have b/g twins and it has been truly a lifesaver to have this stroller. It accomodates two infant seats and very easy to assemble. It is narrow and very easy to manuever so you can get through stores smoothly.My only complaint is the storage. There is lots of it at the bottom but you have to recline the seats to put the infant carriers in it and you can't put anything in the storage basket underneath. Also, the sunshade covers the cupholder and storage compartment on the handle of the stroller so if it's back you can't use it.I couldn't live without this stroller though. It is a godsend and if you are a mom of twins or just have two small kids, this is a great option!"
5,lost orbo,This is a great use of the big Os voice for a range of songs we all know. Truly a pleasure to listen to
2,jksey,"After reading the reviews prior to ordering, I was very disappointed in the product after it arrived. On several songs, he seems to struggle (i.e. ""Words"" is a good example) and the overall quality of the CD (both audio and selections) can't hold a candle to ""The All- Time Greatest Hits of Roy Orbison"". Two bonus tracks (Too Soon to Know and My Friend) are more reminiscent of the Roy I remember."
5,Johnny`s amazing SUN recordings complete.,"This amazing box from Bear Family Records includes all SUN recordings plus an eye on the wall at his first Columbia session.Amazing good sound.Here you can hear Johnny sing ""Rock and roll Ruby"" pure rockabilly.It is amazing how his last rockabilly recordings 45 years later has the same good rocking sound.Compare it to the rockabilly recordings on ""Unearthed"".If you buy this and ""Unearthed"" you will find out that Johnny got back to his country roots.Buy it you will not regret it,well spent money."
5,The Best of the Internet,"Okay, sure... this little indie show is about gamers, but I know absolutely nothing about gaming... and I LOVE IT! The writing is smart and funny. The cast is superb. There's a lot of video on the internet these days, and this is the best of it. I couldn't recommend it more enthusiastically."
4,Joker,This cd's is ok if you like slow house. But if you like hard house of fast house music do not buy this cd.
2,SMALL FONT,The font on this book is so small you need a microscope to read it. Just FYI - I will need to seek this book with a large font. No wonder people are reading books online
5,delicious light flavor!,Absolutely delicious and not too sweet! Highly recommended to dessert lovers looking for alternatives!
3,"It Works, Kind Of.","This is a handy, LIGHTWEIGHT gizmo. It picks small objects up with precision. But it would be downright dangerous to take a 16 oz. can from a high shelf without a helmet! One problem with the description: It says the device has a locking trigger, and it does NOT. And unless you have very long arms, you will need one. The jaws won't stay closed if you let go of the handle to get an object you have just grabbed. I've been able to use mine by wrapping a sturdy rubber band around the handle and trigger, and pushing the trigger to open the jaws. Like I said, for LIGHTWEIGHT use!"
5,You don't need to understand what channeling is,"Channeling is not for me, but that didn't stop me to read the material channeled by someone else and get valuable information.I quickly went through the first five chapters.The sixth chapter is the most important one: ""Conclusion: Our Message to Earth"". It addresses the most important subjects in our life, and that alone makes this book worth to read.The messages make a lot of sense: they are deep, they are pointing towards the direction we're heading.Among all the negativities and uncertainties today, the channeled messages are POSITIVE, uplifting, strengthening and giving us HOPE.Again, you don't have to have interest in channeling to gain valuable information from this book."
5,Fantastic!,"This is one of the best albums in my collection, and one that I can listen to over and over. The guys are extremely talented and I keep hoping they'll come out with something new. Great stuff!"
1,Unless you are good at Audio Cassette Learning Don't bother,"If you need the personal interaction to learn a language, this is not for you. The tape pretty much speaks a useful phrase and then translates it and you are expected to repeat, remember and use it. Rather difficult to recreate the sounds of native speakers as a beginner."
3,Not bad,"I found the variety of situations on the tape very useful. Pronunciation is always the hardest part of Danish. As an aid to my learning, I just kept this on in the background while I cleaned the house, etc. and it was very helpful."
2,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this one, unless you just HAVE to buy EVERY book on the Alamo and the Texas War. Serious students might want to check this one out from their local library, just to get another perspective, but that's about the only thing positive about this book. Inaccurate and careless research, need I say more ? There are plenty of well done tomes on this subject, but this isn't one of them. A better choice would be Edmondson's book: THE ALAMO STORY, or Hardin's: TEXIAN ILLIAD or better still, Todish's: ALAMO SOURCEBOOK 1836."
4,A grat read for students and those new to professional image,"This is one of the first books on image and appearance that I ever purchased. I found it to be right on point when it comes to outlining the essentials of image and professional appearance. I first used it as a new student entering the field of image and professional development. The book is well laid out, easy to read and the pictures are clear and helpful. Before I became an image consultant, I had no idea what business casual meant. Now as a professional image consultant, I use the book as a reference guide when preparing seminars on image and branding. I have recommended this book on many occasions for my students. I also recommend Executive Image PowerExecutive Image Power: Top Image Experts Share What to Know to Advance Your Careerwhich is also an excellent resource for career-minded individuals wishing to enhance their image and brand."
2,It's ok,This book is too old and did not keep my attention. Most of what it says is just common sense nothing fresh or appealing. I gave it away. What can I say.
3,Good book for people just starting to look after their apperance,"Its too broadIf you are just beggining to think about or change you apperance then this book id for you.If you are well and truly in the know how with how you look and what you can and can not wear then this book is NOT for youThis book covers the general speal on apperances counta and professional presence.It goes over broadly traditional business dress, business casual dress, and plus sized professionals.its good because it has pictures scattered through out. Over all it is a good book if you are just beggining to change your apperance.I would wait until it goes down in price however as I dont think it is a fantastic ROI."
5,Jim Henson's Best Film,This little known film was one of Henson's last efforts before he died in 1990. I consider it one of his very best works. We have a tradition in our house to watch this film every Christmas Eve. It still brings tears to my eyes.This film deserves to be distributed on DVD.
5,Best kids movie,I remember when I was little I used to watch this movie all the time. Then one day when I was older (in my teens) I came home to find that my dad had taped over the movie. I was so upset because I loved this movie so much. All these years later I still think about this movie and how much I miss watching it. This is a must see for all families with small children.
5,The Christmas Toy,"I remember watching this movie when I was 7 on TV. I recorded it and would watch it every year. When Toy Story came out, it reminded me of this movie and I wanted to try to find it again. Thanks to the Internet, I was able to find it here. I am surprised that so many people remember it.It's funny because I did not remember that Kermit was in it. I just remember Rugby. I am looking forward to seeing it again and I hop it will be as magical as when I was 7."
5,I want this on DVD,"I own this VHS tape, but who watches VHS anymore? I want this show on DVD-It ranks among the best Christmas specials I have ever seen, and I am no spring chicken! It seems unfair that the young children now and in the future will be unable to see this show due to the neglect of whoever owns the rights to it. Get with the program and release it on DVD this year! Do parents a favor and let us buy quality holiday shows for our kids that actually teach something to our family."
5,The Christmas Toy,"I am so excited to find this on Amazon.com, this was a favorite of mine growing up and i watched it every chrismas, sadly as i got older it was misplaced and for years i have looked for the tape, then a friend told me to check here. This movie makes me feel like a child again. I also reccomennd A Very Muppet Christmas, if you like this movie, as in that movie they have all of the muppets, maybe ABC Family will play this as a christmas Special as part of thier 25 days of Christmas, now that Disney has rights to the muppets."
5,One of the greatest for Jim Henson,"This is such a sweet story about friends,family and about learning that we can't always be on top. Christmas Toy is tops with me for holiday feature films along with Emmit Otters Jug Band christmas, this only goes to show you Jim Henson is/was brilliant."
3,Nice looking shoes with some flaws,"The shoes is good and comfort, however the back of the shoe which support the heel is make with some cheap plastics. The plastics broken after 3 month of use."
1,Bad guides to manners are worse than having no money,There are no shortcuts to etiquette. This book is proof. It is more like an undeited magazine article than a comprehensive guide to modern civility.
5,Awesome Black Metal!!,"Lightning quick black metal, this cd never lets up at all until the very end, every song is fast and explosive and they all sound different which is a very good thing. I love this cd after the first time hearing it. Black Metal was made to be this fast."
3,Comfortable but really small for the price,"Love that it is auto inflate, cushion is actually nice to sit on as opposed to some other seats out there. Only thing I dont like is its just barely big enough to sit on. I feel like it was made for a child to sit on. They should make larger versions and this would be great.Moving around gets to be a bit of an annoyance as your have to roll it up and stash it everytime you want to change positions. My family and i are used to just hooking a seat cushion to the back loop on our belts so anytime u needed to move you just got up and walked."
5,Works great,"I paid $23 with free shipping. It's comfortable enough and light weight, rolls up and has good camo. Just what I needed and a great price."
5,Beautiful,This is absolutely fantastica beautiful performance.thank godot the actor is irish.in my humble opinion an american accent would not have workedIts the best book I have heard scince Jeremy Irons reading Lolitabut dont forgeot to get the other two in the trillogy as well
5,"I feel so relieved to have finally finished this, like making it to the peak of a challenging mountain.","It's an amazing work of genius, but very difficult and slow going. It's more of a modernist prose poem than it is a traditional novel, and if it's read in that way, taking time to savor each of the dazzling ideas that pack each page, then the task is a little easier, but still not easy. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the other two novels in the Beckett Trilogy, but that doesn't mean that it was any less great as a work of literature."
5,More Beautiful Quilts,"Here's a stunning collection of dramatic and magical quilts teaching about winter holidays of various cultures and describing winter sights such as a million-colored aurora borealis and a glowing wash of sunset against darkening snow. Swirling lights and crackling flames flicker bright against deep darkness, and there is a clever depiction of reading by flashlight. An extra treat for adults is the brief explanations of how the quilts were made. ""Winter Lights"" will warm the senses of young and old. See the author's first quilt bookPieces: A Year in Poems & Quilts"
3,Lots of storage!,This was a gift for my grandson who is three. His mom loved it. Held all of his cars.
2,Hot Wheels Car Case Launcher,The case is very weak to put the Hot Wheels inside. I bought my son a short time ago and no longer endures the weight of Hot Wheells. I do not recommend the use of this product is only appearance.
1,Disappointing,"We just purchased this case for my 5 year old son for Christmas. Red flags should have gone up when when found only one at the store and the latch was broken. We drove to the next town to purchase one. After careful use, our latch broke after only 10 days of use. I am having a hard time contacting the company to see about getting a new one."
1,Never got a chance to use it.,"The case was received with a broken hinge. Fortunately Amazon said that it would pay for the return and ship another next day in time for Christmas. Unfortunately, I checked my account and saw that it is expected to be delivered at the end of Jan beginning of Feb. I called again to see what was going on and she couldn't tell me anything other than that I was getting it when I get it (even though it was in stock, I had the first caller's name). I should have spent the extra three bucks to get it at a brick and mortar store."
5,Great Case,"My 5 year old son got this for Christmas and just loves it. He used to have a 48 car case, but this one holds twice the cars and has compartments of all sizes to hold his more unusual Hot Wheels cars and trucks. The attached launcher is a nice bonus. The only weakness I see with the case is that the extendable arm/handle for pulling the case along by its wheels is a bit flimsy and likes to twist when the case is loaded full."
2,Not as sturdy as I would expect,"I got this for my son for Chrstimas because he has so many hot wheels. It was not as sturdy as I would have expected. The arm used to ""wheel"" it around is very cheap and I am waiting for it to break. I had thought about sending it back but changed my mind."
2,Not as good as I expected...,"I bought this car case for my 4-year old son, who has over 200 cars. My hope was that he could use this case to store half his collection, and easily identify his cars. (Currently, we store his cars in a large bin and, when he's searching for a specific car, he dumps out all 200+ cars.) I must say I was somewhat disappointed in the case. My issues are as follows: (1) It's difficult for my 4-year old to open by himself. (2) Not all his cars fit perfectly within the case. It's best suited to small Matchbox and Hotwheels cars. The Car Movie cars and other larger matchbox do not fit. (3) The divider is flimsy. That said, for the price, I think the car case is fine. And my son certainly does enjoy wheeling the case around the house!"
4,Great storage!,"My son has hundreds of Hot Wheels cars and this is perfect for him to store his favorites. We used to throw all of them into a plastic bin, making it hard for him to find the exact car he wanted. After going through his collection, he has the ones he plays with frequently all nicely stored and now he can't wait to go on a trip so he can take his car ""suitcase""."
1,Poor Quality,"My kids take good care of their toys. I actually can't think of any other toy that they've broken, but this broke in two spots within 15 minutes of them receiving it. They weren't even playing with it, just exploring it by moving the launcher ramps up and down (one cracked off) and by opening and closing the inner piece of plastic that holds the cars in place (one of the points cracked). And the case really doesn't close that well without parental alignment help."
1,DO NOT BUY this awful product,"This is an absolutely dreadful excuse for a matchbox car carrier. It is a flimsy, poorly designed, poorly manufactured injection molded plastic piece of %^&*.The case hinges don't stay on their alignment pole.The open/close latch doesn't fit squarely onto it's mating part.The ramps in the individual car cells aren't wide enough to hold many cars.It doesn't open or close with any ease, often not at all.There is not a single good thing that I can say about this miserable product. My 3 yr old son was ecstatic to open it for his birthday tonight. It broke my heart to see him wrestle valiantly with the stupid thing, trying to get it open, trying to get his cars to stay in their cells, trying to close it, looking at me all the while with a ""What the heck is wrong with this thing, Mommy?!?!?!"" dejected look on his face. Awful awful awful."
5,Car Carry Case,"This is a fantastic car case. It has large slots, medium slots, as well as average sized slots for all your match boxes/hot wheels. My son has hundreds of them and this holds what was in a shoe box thankfully! Great product would buy over and over again!"
2,Didn't Last Very Long - Very Disappointed,"Put this on my registry based upon the review and product description. Barely owned for two months and just as I was making dinner, the largest platter shattered in the oven. Hello, is this not ""bakeware""? So disappointed it's not even funny.I already had Pyrex on the registry and needed a different set, as we keep a kosher kitchen and I needed to make the distinction. Will never purchase any Anchor products again; I guess I will try to find the size of Pyrex with a red top. That brand a much better than this. Do not buy, unless you never plan to bake anything!"
5,Unforgettable music,"This is one of the best instrumental CD's I have purchased. It is easy to listen to and makes good background for an event such as a wedding which is what I used it for. I especially like the version of the Bridal March. It is just long enough but not too long for the walk down the aisle by the bride. It is what was used in the wedding. I highly recommend it. Also, after I purchased it on line, it arrived very quickly. I wish it was still available in music stores."
3,Written for sea level,"I appreciated that the recipes were rated according to difficulty. What I didn't really enjoy was how the recipes were written for sea level and only had vague high-altitude adjustments. Baking at 5000 ft (Denver) and baking at 10000 ft (Deer Valley) is not quite the same thing, as Pie in the Sky has shown. I haven't gotten up the courage to try any of these recipes yet, because I'm so afraid they'll come out wrong."
5,Enjoyed,"GOTHIC Romance. From back cover:""An apartment in London where a mysteriously missing friend and a stranger's startling kisses posed questions that lovely Kati Nickleby had to answer. A magnificent mansion in Rome where Kati found herself surrounded by incredibly beautiful people and unspeakably ugly secrets. An ancient Italian villa where Kati came to search out the roots of evil--and stayed to be caught in the tendrils of terror. Passion had led Kati to horror's utlimate haven where love was the most deadly lie of all..."""
5,great music,"This was a very hard to find cd,I had not heard it since I was a teen and was searching for it and found it here on your sight. I was looking fot it for one song in particular and the song was called STU,however the rest of the cd is just as funky as that song and very worthwhile having found it again thanks Amazon."
1,no english subtitles,i am disapointed i bought it because it said it has english subtitles. it does not have even though they advertised it.
2,"The main attraction in this soap opera is the breathtaking Gabby Espino, who plays a ""country girl"" in Venezuela.","Actually, she grew up on a wealthy ranch in the countryside as a strong-willed cowgirl.Gabby also starred in the telenovela/soap opera ""Mundo the Fieras"" with Sebastian Rulli. She is so gorgeous that she must go everywhere with a bodyguard to keep the wolves away.Dying Grandpa knows her evil and greedy half-brother will do anything to steal the whole property instead of sharing the inheritance. Will grandpa be able to stop him?A sexy man comes to the ranch and the attraction starts with Gabby, but she's not inclined to fall for anyone. Meanwhile, his ex-wife interferes.Gabby's rich city cousin gets stood up at the altar, yet agrees a second time to marry the ambitious, cheating jerk. Will they get married or will the second marriage be derailed also?Lots of drama between Gabby and hot admirer."
2,Same info at www.cboe.com,"I picked up the book this morning and found it contained the same info you can get for free at the Chicago Board Options Exchange website. Furthermore, you can download the options calculator (Windows version), along with a slew of other training material, for free. I gave it two stars because it's in bound form, while the 300+ pages I printed off the cboe website aren't."
3,"Decisive, Clear but no new revelations","While the book was well thought out and written, it lacked real ""Meat"" to teach others the art of profitting with options. Options could be for everyone even the novice of investors if someone would just write a book on ""Options for Dummies"""
4,Good overview & hands-on manual for using options w/equities,"James Bittman's book ""Options for the Stock Investor"" provides a good overview and practical guide for using options in conjunction with a stock portfolio. Of any ofthe books I've read about this subject, this is by far the best as the others often tend to leave out strategies and/or ignore the importance of measuring overall rate of return.Written by an industry insider (Jim Bittman works for the Chicago Board Options Institute), it's the best book of its kind."
2,The Key word is Enhance,"There are things you can do with options that you can not do with any other investment tool. This book, and most of the others, do a good job of explaining the theory behind options and their math. This book is no exception, and neither is the software."
5,EXCELLENT RESOURCE FOR INVESTORS ABROAD,This book is a great tool for any investor who is wanting to increase and protect their winnings! It is extremely easy to understand and gives phenomenal examples that will teach the reader. I recommend it to anyone wanting to make big bucks!
3,Wanted to love this,"I normally love children's books with poetic text but this was a bit of a stretch and felt too contrived for a preschool audience. Food having an ""orange smell"", shivering livestock, and ""serious"" birds were all images that I can appreciate as an adult but are a bit hard for the very literal minds of preschoolers. The illustrations are lovely and peaceful, I just wish I liked the text better."
5,A wonderful read,"I purchased this book for my fourth and fifth grade students to enjoy, but being such a fan of Cynthia Rylant I read it multiples times a year. Enjoy!"
4,Student Review of race and Sports,In blck and white was a great story on how African Americans are not included in the front office of sports franchises.The book bu Kenneth L. Shrophire also shows how African Americans control the three major sports on the field but not in the front office. In the book Kenneth stats that 99% of all sprots franchise are owned by a white person. The book also stats how white owners have discrimnated against black athletes on the field and in the office. This book is good at showing you how African Americans have struggled in professional sports in all aspects.
1,Poorly made and painted,These rubber ducks are very poorly manufactured and painted. Areas of paint are missing or off center. Some of the ducks aren't quite finished. They are definitely less than satisfactory.
5,Ducky Collector,"My wife is a Ducky Collector and we have not seen these ducks out on the open market. You may receive 12 ducks, but it's only 4 individual ducks, the other 8 are copies...which was great for us; we are geocachers and so we leave duckies behind as trade items."
4,Cute Story,"I have the whole set of Heart of the West Series and they all have been cute reads. However, this one I couldn't warm up to Madison at all . I thought she was cold and manipulative. I couldn't believe while they were making love she kept at him to sign to her Ad Agency. That was really tacky. Another reviewer talked of Chance ranting and raving but I felt he had the right. He was used and manipulated the whole way. Well as in all romances, they end up figuring it out and getting married but I still just couldn't warm to the heroine."
4,Sexy and informative,"I am a Romance Specialist and bought this book today because it has some unique and great positions that I thought might be useful to my customers. While some of the postions are downright acrobatic, most can be accomplished by normal people. I'm still confused about the 99 Positions, because the copy I have lists almost 200. The photos are very sexy but in an artsy, not dirty way. A great find."
1,Very disapointing,I purchased all of the set of these for my grandson and they would not pull. They were a waste of time and money...
1,Designed to waste as much ink as possible.,"It clogs continually, and it always takes more than one cleaning cycle to get it printing right again. Which wastes all sorts of ink. When a cartridge gets down to 10% or less it won't allow you to run a cleaning cycle anymore, it tells you there's not enough ink left to run cycle to give you an idea about how much ink it wastes while cleaning. It's down right criminal how the printer manufactures purposely gouge you with replacement cartridges. scanning is adequate though."
1,What a disappointment,"I've been trying to get this printer to work for three days with no luck. I have a Mac operating on OS X 10.3.3 and downloaded the latest printer driver off the Epson site. Every time I try to print, the printer stalls out on me (""Print job stopped""). I've uninstalled and installed again, to no avail. The Epson help site is useless. All my previous printers have been HPs and I wish I had stuck to them. This printer is also the loudest machine I've ever had -- really annoying. In all, I'd say I wasted $50 (after rebate) on what looks like a very large and ugly doorstopper. Don't buy this machine!"
2,Disappointing product,"All in one design is attractive but in practice this product does not meet expectations. No single component (scanner, copier or printer) works without annoying troubleshooting required.The printer cartridges from Epson are constantly being pushed anytime ink is low. The Epson cartridges are significantly overpriced compared to generic pieces. Another bothersome point is that once both the color and B/W cartidges are empty you will need to replace both in order to start print again.I am still looking for a low maintenance, plug n play printer that is ready for use anytime I need it. Input from friends is that I will only be happy when I shift to a laser printer."
2,bad all in one,"This would not work, Would not print or copy,never had this happen from amazon before."
1,"Bought used, immediate obvious inferior quality","I purchased this through the ebay marketplace. The seller sent with no USB cord which is understandable. The speed and quality of the printer never seemed close to average. I am comparing this to past printers such as entry level Lexmark, Canon and HP's.The printer seems to go through quite a bit of work to pull paper through the tray. Spend less and get a stand-a-lone printer. Lexmark is usually a good price and works well."
1,Not User Friendly,I am fairly new to the world of computers as I'm sure many of you are. With that in mind I do not recommend this printer. First I am sold a brand new printer in which I have to go online to update the drivers. The instructions for this process are vague and conflicting. I found the color quality poor and the very expensive ink disappears at a rapid rate.
3,"So far, so good",Have not used it yet - but it looks my four year old son will really like working through the book.
5,As a teacher...,"I use this book with my youngest beginners. I also like Chester's Easiest Piano Course but I that doesn't seem as popular in the US. I learned with this method myself and find the students really enjoy the book. It is possible, as noted in a few of the other reviews, for kids to just pick this up and use it and that goes a long way to explaining its endurance and popularity. The 'middle C method' with its simple introduction to notes and rhythm creates happy young musicians and that should be the main focus where children and music are concerned."
5,Easy & Fun way to learn music,This book is one of the easiest and fun book to learn music. The colorful funny characters makes it easy to learn new notes and concepts. This is great for beginners who have no prior knowledge and great for all ages. I will definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn piano music.
2,Bad printing,I'm teaching beginners the piano and the reason I like this book is because I can accompany the children while they play the simplest things. Unfortunately on two of the pages the piano accompaniment was unreadable due to bad printing. It looks like a very poor photocopy.
5,Great for young beginners,"This is a wonderful book for younger beginners. It teaches skills in a logical progression that includes both clefs, both hands, time signatures, note values, etc.It also has note graphics on each page that help the young student make visual reference between the note written on the clef and where the note is on the piano.I would highly recommend this book for young beginnig piano students."
2,No so Easy,I thought this would be a good tool to home school but too hard to follow for a 6 year old.
1,Do not buy this without a CD,I just bought this one and without a CD this book is not enough. I suggest you buy the book with the CD. Book is recommended for below 8 yrds old without experience
5,Good,"Pleased to see that these books are still available. I miss the elves that used to be on my books, 25 yrs ago but this is great for my little boy as I begin to teach him."
4,For those that know piano well,If you are a piano teacher then this book will help little kids learn. If you are a parent with little music knowledge this will not help you teach your children the piano. I can read music and bought this to help teach my daughter. It helped me remember notes and play songs but it did not help me explain it to my daughter. She needs a piano teacher!!
3,John Thompson's Easiest Piano Course,"This book is OK if you had not seen ""Teaching Little Fingers to Play"". I would probably skip this one."
3,ok book,I found that this book skims over things too quickly for children to full grasp the concept before moving on.
3,"Good content, but flimsy pages for toddler fingers","This book will be used for a 3 3/4 year old girl and later on for her brother when he is old enough to start playing the piano. The content of the book is gearned for very small children, but I am always afraid that they tear the flimsy pages. Why aren't the pages made out of cardboard or thicker paper, like in my other song books for toddlers, so their little fingers can turn the pages without having to worry that they rip them? This alone could become a discouragement."
4,Guests can pick up this book from your piano and start learning to play!,"I keep this book and its sequel on my piano. Recently a friend came over with her 4 year-old daughter and started playing the lessons in the book. The two of them were able to make significant progress in about 30 minutes.I am using the activities to jump start my toddler's music exposure. She enjoys the cover, and the notes are simple enough to engage her. She is learning timing and correspondence between tone and piano key, and I am using the time to fine-tune my own understanding of piano playing.Overall, this book is a very good companion for your piano if you want to give guests and children the opportunity to play your piano and learn even with no previous lessons."
4,Good Book for Beginner Piano Students,"I usually teach older children piano, but I recently added younger children to my classes. So I wanted a book that was simple and easy to use and wouldn't frustrate the younger students. The notes are large and lessons are presented in a logical sequence. However, I feel that more pieces should be given to reinforce notes learned before new notes are introduced. To make up for this deficit, I sometimes have students play the same pieces over several times (even when they come on another day); young children can get bored with this because they feel they already know the piece being played."
5,A staple for children learning to play piano,I had this book and the second one when I was a little guy learning to play the piano. I had so much fun with this and recomend thar you use this with your kids. This will help them learn to play a lot better and let them have fun.
4,No Hawaii : (,"I checked this book out of the library and liked it so well that I got on Amazon and bought a copy. It has a wide variety of hikes all over the country. I'm not always a fan of Lonely Planet because they include so many minutiae; for hike purposes though it's really helpful!One disappointment is discovering that it's only the continental US - no Hawaii, no Alaska."
3,"Too much space, not enough time","This tries, although admirably, to cram a lot of country into one book."
3,not all there,"The CD is great in that it is a blast from the past but the CD is missing 4 selections and the last one is a Pepsi commercial. Good grief - this CD is about Coke. How dare someone put a Pepsi product in with a Coke. Selection 58 is Jay & the Techniques, 59 is Jay and the Techniques, 60 is Come Alive (Pepsi commercial). No Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrill. This annamoly should have been mentioned before buying. I checked with other sellers since my purchase and they tell me that the CD looks legit but it has wrong selections near the end. Buyer beware!"
3,"Personally, I'm a Pepsi man.","This is a collection of Coca-Cola commercials from the 1960s. Coke got a bunch of singers who were popular with young people to record jingles for them. The jingles are actually 60 or 90 second songs, which happen to mention Coca-Cola in the lyrics. Every song features the lyrics, ""Things go better with Coca-Cola. Things go better with Coke."", but they are all completely different other than that. Performers with two or three tracks on this CD recorded two or three different jingles for Coke. Many of the recordings here are actually good, but it gets repetitive listening to over an hour of Coke commercials."
5,Avoca review,"Being from the locality, this book is a fasinating look back at avoca life and history. I found some many interesting information on the whole parish and surrounding areas."
2,Runs larger than stated size,"I ordered these in my usual size 8 1/2 N. They were too long, they fit more like a size 9, so they had to go back."
5,An excellent book for any level sysadmin,"I used to believe people out there that said ""Who needs a book on Time Management?!"" Boy was I wrong. This book is immensely helpful. There are some things that you begin to do as a system administrator as far as task lists, ticketing systems, carrying your planner everywhere -- that this book reinforces and helps you get into the habit of doing. The goal just like everything else we do is to make us efficient as possible and not waste our brain power on frivolous activities. Tom hits the nail on the head numerous times throughout the book even giving suggestions on how to fight dreaded burn out that many of us admins face.I recommend this book to all of my peers. It's a book you'll keep coming back to throughout your career."
5,Agree with the other reviews.... this book is a must!!!,"If you are a sysadmin or netadmin this book is a MUST. Great book. Short and too the point. Won't go into details about the review because the other reviews have already taken care of that. What are you waiting for. Buy this book, get control of your life schedule!"
1,Puzzled...,"I'm puzzled by all of the positive reviews of this book. I couldn't even finish it because it discussed things that were so rediculously basic I can't believe they were in a book. For example one of the recommendations was to carry my planner with me all of the time. Suggesting blowing off meetings because you don't want to waste two hours sitting in a meeting only to be there for the sole purpose to say that the 'new server color is blue.' I mean, really? There are contradictions galore as well.Now, I seem to be the odd one out in my review of this book so take this with a grain of salt, but I was really disappointed and wish I could get my money back."
5,How to retain control over time during project management tasks,"Thomas A. Limoncelli's Time Management For System Administrators tells how to retain control over time during project management asks, and comes from real examples taken from the author's own career in desktop support and server management. From handling interruptions and keeping a calendar to developing routines for frequent issues, Time Management For System Administrators should reach the entire computer industry with solutions applicable to a range of issues."
5,an excellent American black metal album,"Through the Eyes of Night solidifies Fog's position in the up and coming American black metal sceen. They can easily hold their own against the old guard Norwegian bands in terms of musicianship. This LP doesn't have a single weak track, it is remarkable from start to finish. Fog's sound could be described as similar to the first two albums from Emperor, though Fog seems to show a somewhat more diverse sound. The album retains a distinctive black metal feel, while showing occasional thrash and death metal influences. The music is very chaotic but simultaneously atmospheric. The drumming is extremely fast but admirably controlled. Vocals by ""Lord Typhus"" have the typical black metal delivery and are consistant throughout the album. Fog's lyrics are focused on traditional black metal themes and are never trite or overdone. Fans of Mayhem, Darkthrone, and older Emperor will surely enjoy this overlooked USBM release."
2,I shouldn't have waited to buy College Hoops,"I waited until this week to buy College Hoops 2K7, expecting great things from this EA Sports title. When I rented March Madness 07, I was extremely disappointed.The graphics are very good, which is really the only advantage this has over College Hoops. I did not, however, find any camera angle within the game that captures the ""spirit"" of college basketball like College Hoops does.The gameplay in March Madness is absolutely awful. I could not find a way to alter the controller configuration. Unlike College Football, the controller configuration for March Madness is not easily laid out. I often found myself hitting what is usually a ""shoot"" button, only to attempt a lay-up from 3-point range.This isn't to say that College Hoops doesn't have down-sides, but this review isn't intended to discuss that title. If you're debating between the two titles, don't waste your time on this one."
4,A solid game,"This game has so many features that the other basket ball games just don't have. It plays well, it's intense, it works. If you are going to get a basketball game, get this one."
3,I haven't played March Madness 07 but.....,"I have not played March Madness 07, so take your advice from these reviews. I have however, played College Hoops 2K7 and enjoyed it. 2K7 has,in my opinion, great, smooth gameplay. The menu navigation for College Hoops is confusing at first, but you'll eventually figure it. It has a good legacy mode, where you coach your team to hopefully, a national title. The graphics didn't blow me away, but the gameplay was good enough for me not to notice when I played. If you enjoy college sports, add this to your collection!"
4,Screwballs,"Better than Porkys, better than Joysticks, Screwballs is as fantastic now as it was when it was released in 1983. More than 25 years and it is still going strong! The ending of the movie is absolutely incredible, as the protagonists visit a strip club and view the delights of a voluptuous and mammothly-endowed BTC! I highly reccomend this rare DVD for any connoisseur of beautiful females.Here's the great news! The price has come down drastically from even just three months ago! The old DVDs that had initially been offered (One Still Is) may have been second hand or perhaps they were dubbed, who knows. The new DVDs appear to be legitimate studio productions and at the lower price are much more affordable. So if you are out there Mr. Cousin and Mr. Lightkeeper, they have affordable DVDs out on the market now that are brand new. I'm going to buy two more!A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
1,really pretty lame,"The hype on this film far surpassed the reality. The movie was slow paced and overall, pretty stupid. Sometimes you know what you're getting into with these type of movies, but I felt bushwacked on this one. Unlike Porky's, this movie had nothing. The laughs were minimal, the nudity minimal, the ending was absurd. I purchased the blu ray version because it was only 50 cents more. Another let down. My experience with 'blu-rayed' older movies is: why bother? In this case, the copy wasn't any better than a normal DVD copy. I don't often regret a purchase, this time I did. Stupid movie, below average copy, save your money."
2,Quality wasn't what I would expect from a Blu-Ray transfer.,I tried to enjoy this movie but there just wasn't the quality I would expect and it was just plain silly. I probably won't watch this one more than the one time.
3,This was hyped too much.,"I read a few reviews about this album before I bought it and they made it sound like it was Buckethead's ultimate masterpiece. It's good and there are some highlights (like ""Big Sur Moon"" which is like an acoustic variation of ""Helicopter Kick"" on Cobra Strike's ""The 13th Scroll,"" a Buckethead side project), but it's no masterpiece. Overall, I find this album is pretty boring, which is bad coming from my mouth because I consider myself a die-hard Buckethead fan. If you're interested in getting your first Buckethead album, get ""Monsters and Robots."" Then get this when you're an established fan."
3,Willing to induce,"3 1/2Although tempered with tepid tempo, Colma remains some of the expert player's stripped-down, effectively sentimental best."
2,Sounds Like New Age,This is kind of boring but I guess as back ground music it might work. Very repetitive. Not harsh or unpleasant just kind of there. Definitely not what I was expecting. Not at all like the innovative and intense guitar playing that I have seen on video.
5,Probably one of the best underated musicians ever!!!!,"Buckethead.....a very tall, lengthy man wearing a kubiki mask and a KFC bucket on his head. His stage pressence on various shows indicates he is a bit eccentric. Musically,....the man is pure genious and you either get it or you don't. I came across a few songs on Colma and was completely mesmerized by it. Every song has a certain something that draws you into a realm that is calming and even emotionally thought provoking. This album covers the bases. I heard a live version of ""Whitewash"" and was blow away until I heard the album version. This is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. Each song speaks to me in a beautiful way. Just listen to ""Ghost"", ""For Mom"", ""Watching the boats with my dad"" and especially ""Wishing Well"". It just grabs you and takes you somewhere. If you are a fan of music and guitar, pick up anything by Buckethead. Give it a listen. Eventually you'll get it."
5,A BRILLIANT PIECE OF WORK,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL EXHIBIT OF BUCKETHEADS ABILITY TO TRAVEL DOWN ANOTHER AVENUE.""WHATS THE POINT"" IN SAN FRANCISCO IS MISSING THE POINT. THIS CD IS SIMPLY AWESOME!"
5,If Miles Davis played guitar...,"this is what he'd've sounded like. From the Amazon review posted, I was expecting something very Satriani. And while I can see why he's compared to Satriani, COLMA is really one of a kind. This is one of my favorite albums at present, very relaxing. I was interested in particular in Buckethead because he works with Bill Laswell, of whom I am a big admirer (particularly his India-influenced work). COLMA is a great album. For anyone who appreciates exceptional guitar or Miles Davis."
3,Maybe need to listen to another album,"I guess this one of those state of minds kind of music. On a normal state, most of the songs come off pretty monotonous if heard one after the other. But there is no doubt about Buckethead, I've heard some samples of his other albums and he's close to the Gods Vai and Satriani. ""Big Sur Moon"" is one song that I can listen to a 100 times repeat. The Boats with Daddy song is also kinda cool. All in all, good buy for a Buckethead fan, but I'd rather buy another one of his albums like the Praxis ones.Peace"
2,Mauve Rock,"I didn't know who guitarist Buckhead was until the recent resurrection of Guns 'N Roses, and I became intrigued by his strange stage persona of white mask and upturned KFC bucket hat. I became even more intrigued after reading up on the guy and decided to start with this disc as my introduction to his obviously diverse musical history. Granted I cannot compare this with his other works, but I gotta say I found the music on this CD to be sappy, pastel (file under Mauve Rock) and monotonous from start to finish. Nothing dynamic, challenging or all that expressive, and nothing here to really back his virtuosic, avant-garde reputation. This is a flat-liner, plain and simple. Kudos to BH for shifting gears and traveling down different artistic paths, but as for Colma, this is more Yanni than Michael Myers, more John Tesh than Axl Rose. I'd give Buckethead another shot, but I'd be a lot more hesitant before plunking down my [$$]."
3,I don't understand the hype,I really do not understand why this album gets such rave reviews. I heard so much about Buckethead that I had to get this now I wish I had saved my money and gotten something much better. Perhaps this is just not a good introduction to Buckethead.I found myself yawning at many songs that sound almost exactly the same. The same tone on the guitar. The same tempo. I'd recommend Michael Hedges instead of Buckethead.
2,Even Colonel Sanders wouldn't be proud,"Theres no arguing Buckethead is an excellent guitarist when it comes to technical skill and jaw dropping speed. Unfortunately on Colma all that know how adds up to next to nothing. Even Eddie Van Halen valued melody over heroics. Most of the tracks are filled with so much needless meandering even hardcore Phish fans might fall asleep, and the psychedlic experimentations seem half formed and down right indolent. Ok ok so its sort of commendable Buckethead dedicates the album to his parents, but the fact is any hack off the street can pick up a guitar, learn some scales, noodle around for 5 minutes and call it ""Sailing Boats with my Dad"". The only time Buckethead really bares the personality in his sound is on ""Machete"" a blast of ""Kiss my Axe"" guitar shredding that puts much of David Gilmour's guitar work to shame. All in all though Colma will just make you wish Axl Rose and Slash would kiss and make up, or at the very least make up."
3,pleasant,"I now own five releases of BH, anyway I find colma to be a bit depressing and uninspired. Riddled with pleasant melody but for the most part drab."
2,what's the point?,although this is ok it's not really what i go to buckethead for - there are many other musicians and guitarists who've done this mellow/new age stuff for years and done it better than buckethead - what's the point of a buckethead album without the trademark sonic mayhem and innovation? (if you haven't seen him live you just don't know)
2,Buckethead does pop,"I'm sorry, I'm a huge fan of Buckethead but this album just isn't good. Sure there are elements of his genius on this album but most of it sounds like Adult Contemporary or something. Give me his Death Cube K work over this Satriani crap anyday. The heart and soul of Buckethead is in Bucketheadland, Giant Robot, Death Cube K (Dreamatorium), and Monsters and Robots. Buckethead isn't just about the music people... he's about the attitude, persona, and the hilarious/creepy world of a man raised by chickens and smashing his foes with his chainsaw guitar. Get out of your Colma and back in the Coop!"
2,Bucket Head,"If you are a musician or have a good background in music playing, this CD is not recommended for you; period.This CD is played by computer devices, creating an electronic organized pretty sound, topped by a basic guitar playing. Nothing to add except the music can be played and appreciated in an elevator, grocery store or shopping malls.(Have you ever noticed that when someone writes a review and doesn't give 4 or 5 stars, how he or she gets slammed in the votes?)"
5,Just plain beautiful,"Every few seconds on this record, there's a sound that can only be described as gorgeous. And it's a different sound every time. These breathtaking sounds are assembled into equally breathtaking compositions with soaring melodies, and the beauty is squared, not doubled. Never less than tasty, often truly delicious. ""Colma"" reminds me a lot of some of Andy Summers' (ex-Police) solo instrumental work, and also of Mox -- except it's better than either. This is the only Buckethead album I own, or perhaps I should better say it's my first, since I'll be buying more. From reading other reviews of this album it sounds like this is rather different from his other work. A pity, really, though I'm sure his others have their charms as well, which I look forward to discovering."
3,Travel Golf Bage,I liked the bag but if the weight of the clubs is not evenly distributed it does not roll evenly on the wheels.
5,Excellent Value,I'm very happy with this product. Good quality for a very reasonable price. My cart bags fits in the cover with plenty of room and is very easy to carry. My kids use ultra-light stand bags and we're able to get both sets into one of these covers to reduce luggage when we travel.I highly recommend this cover.
3,Adequate for limited travel,We had a hole in the bag upon arriving at our destination (first trip with the bag). The clubs were protected from damage. We arrived back home with no additional damage to the bag. This bag is adequate for limited travel. So for the price it is a fair value.
3,Golf bag review,I would not recommend this bag if you have a long driver with a large head. There is not enough padding to insure against breakage and airlines no longer take responsibility for broken clubs. Not enough protection -
5,A great product.,"This is a great ink for any artist who uses the pen or brush. It is deep black and is water soluble, so it can be easily diluted to make a variety of shades. It is traditionally used used with a brush but it works great as an artist pen ink as well."
5,Awesome service!,I received the product the other day and I must say that I love the stickers . They stick to the wall without no problems.
1,techno in the middle ages?,"two nice pieces, very medieval sounding for about two minutes of what you probably bought the cd to hear, then the third and final piece is something called 'medieval techno' - not only an oxymoron, but a disappointment if it is authentic medieval sounds you seek. all in all, not much for the buck"
1,"THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE, but it isn't very funny.",This CD is only 4 minutes long and Amazon charged me [item price] for it. And I had to wait a month before they finally got around to sending it. The fact that what little was there sounded good doesn't count in these circumstances. I guess that next time I'll come here first and read the reviews.
1,these are not black,"the picture on the net is black, the picture on the box is black, I thought I was getting black but the dang things in the box are not black"
1,Too big for small dogs,"This fingerbrush is made for a very large finger. Also if you have a small breed dog, this product is too large for their mouth."
1,"Too large, too hard.","In the past, I used Petrodex fingerbrushes to brush my cats' teeth. The brushes fit my finger perfectly and were soft and pliable. This new style is way too large for my finger and is too hard and harsh for my cats' gums. It leaves their gums red. Do not plan to repurchase."
2,Industrial material!,"This is one tough finger toothbrush, it's very hard rubber? plastic? and will not flex when it is on your finger. The brush ""nubbins"" work well, but it's uncomfortable for me to use in my 20 pound dog's mouth. It's bigger than my finger, and slides around while it's on.I would not recommend this particular product."
3,ok product,A little loose on my finger but get the job done. I think I will have to find another toothbrush for me.
3,"Not very good; Get a ""regular"" style toothbrush instead","Like most other reviewers here, I found this finger toothbrush to be very hard to use.I would say I have average size hands (for ex: I wear a size Medium adult male snowboarding glove).The finger toothbrush has a very large opening - way too large for my fingers. And for my wife, not a chance she could get it to stay on her finger.The bristles are too short and very close together. I don't think it really scrubs anything.I am going back to using a ""regular"" style toothbrush (like the ones humans use). I have found that a toothbrush made for a baby works pretty well on dogs (small dogs, like mine)."
1,Not good.,"Just get a regular tooth brush it works better. Don't waste your money, time ,energy or frustrating the dogs. Forget it!"
3,Hard to clean,"I bought these thinking that I would have more control over where I was brushing than I would with a regular toothbrush. It's not very easy to clean all the toothpaste out of the little nooks and crannies. On the plus side, my senior dogs let me brush their teeth. I tried several years ago and it was a disaster."
2,Ehh. Not so much,"These tooth brushes are a little too big for your average hand. The first time using it, I put it on my thumb because it wouldn't fit on any other finger. I have two small dogs, less that 10 lbs and they worked great for the front teeth. The bristles are nice and soft, but I could get my finger in the back of their months to clean those teeth at all. I ended up switching back to the kids toothbrush I have been using, and that works much better."
5,What a true gift this book is!,"Prayer for Seniors is an incredible book and a must have for seniors. The author, through each prayer created, touched on every thought associated with the aging process and explained how God is there by your side through every new challenge or journey."
3,Rougher Stylings,"This one is a little bit rougher, stylistically and not quite as tight as ""The Evening Drag"" but it shows Kim Torres's raw potential, and the lyrics and vocals are every bit as strong on this one as on their follow-up album (sometimes even stronger). This one is actually my preference but I mistakenly gave 3 stars and couldn't fix it to be the appropriate 5. Real standouts are the title track and ""Senhor Santo Cristo.""Seems like their second CD ""THE EVENING DRAG"" is where it all really came together (or fell apart, since they never came out with a 3rd CD), but to have the beginning of a gorgeous story, check out ""WILD HORSE""."
4,TORREZ blows me away. This album is amazing.,"This album is full of great songs and superlative production. This is really one of the best records I've bought in a long long time. This is a band that's mapping out their soundscape in a territory of darkness, abuse and redemption. Classic."
4,An Excelent Source for the History of Chemical Science,"This edition to the Dover Classics of Science series traces the continuing growth of radioactive science. The book begins with the difficulties of studying transitory radioactive elements, moving on to discuss similarities between unrelated radioactive substances, the theory of isotopes, and ultimately the Bohr model of the atom. Included is an extensive historical introduction by the editor, along with frequent editorial comments on the papers that make up the majority of the work. These annotations allow even the layman to understand these basic and important trends in radioactive science."
5,"Income is not the subject of ""income taxes""","This book in very clear and precise language, and quotations from U.S. Supreme court cases will reveal how the Internal Revenue Laws have been misapplied to hard working Americans. From the House Congressional Record of March 27, 1943: ""The income tax is, therefore, not a tax on income as such. It is an excise tax with respect to certain activities and privileges which is measured by reference to the income which they produce. The income is not the subject of the tax: it is the basis for determining the amount of the tax."" Are you involved in a revenue taxable activity in your normal employment? Check it out, this book is a must for all patriotic Americans."
5,Truth and the so called income tax,"The author takes the time to explain with clairty the difficult task of understanding the delima of our tax system. Although some knowledge of law is helpful, it is not necessary. The reader is taken through the history of our tax system, by explaination. Using supreme court decsions and laws passed by congress the reader will understand that, there is no law that requires someone to pay the so-called income tax because you work."
2,Not enough info and too tedious,"If you've never studied anything of this sort it might point you in a direction to find more as many of the references are good. However ... if you know anything of mystery schools and symbolism this book tells you I have a secret and I'm not gonna share it (although most books of this nature do that but they atleast throw you a bone). Nothing new or revolutionary is shared, the information can be found elsewhere a lot easier. I suffered through this book hoping that maybe some glimpse of a deep initiatic mystery might be exposed and was disappointed time and again. One or two stories were interesting such as the man who worked constantly at just about anything including moving his fingers knowing that any work yields results... but this is no prize. If you're deathly interested take the book out from the library."
5,Excellent choice as an intro. to Renaud,"If you are not familiar with Renaud's music, this CD is a very good introduction to some of his best known and best loved songs. My all-time favorites include: La Mère à Titi, Mistral Gagnant and C'est Quand Qu'on Va Ou?"
3,Good basic guide for the begginer,"""The Guide to owning Dwarf Rabbits"" is a good basic guide to the first time rabbit owner. This book covers topics like Housing, feeding and health. ""The Guide to Owning Dwarf Rabbits"" is written in an easy to understand style and contains all you need to know for your first rabbit, but is not very in depth for those with rabbit experience."
5,Abba - Gold: Greatest Hits for Easy Piano,Great Transaction. I received my copy in a timely manner.The other copy was sent to a friend as a gift and she isenjoying it too.
3,"Was great before, but not so great now","John Tobler has written a fairly good book on ABBA, but is far too focused on the events surrounding ABBA's UK success (and failures). His style of writing is difficult to read. His sentences seem to ramble on, and at times they are quite hard to follow. There is very little really new information here. That was even true before reading the more recent books by Carl Magnus Palm and Jean-Marie Potiez. And now that those two authors have published their versions of the ABBA story, ABBA Gold seems very basic."
3,Could Be Better...,"Music was wonderful, but my clients complained about the chanting and vocals. One client asked me to put on a different CD during her massage."
3,Very nice,"The music is very relaxing. The spoken words (which last throughout the entire CD) were less prefered. But all in all, a very calming, relaxing CD"
2,"Informationally great , but claustrophobic and dull.","FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER is a very subtle and understated film concerning, most specifically, the four days in 1969 in which U.S Ambassador to Brazil Charles Burke Elbrick was held hostage by the Student Revolutionaries, the MR-8. This is not an ""edge-of-your-seats Political thriller that is powerful and exciting"" (all of terms that critics use). Instead, this film is told in a quasi-documentarian style that examines the emotions of all that were involved in this kidnapping. The information is excellent and is positively necessary in understanding Brazilian history, but I found the film as a whole very claustrophobic and ultimately dull."
3,Eh...,"I've got no complaints with the major components of this product. The scissors work well, the blade is sharp and the file has come in handy. Unfortunately, every time I go to use the pen, it is dried up and I have to find something to scribble to get the ink flowing again. I was hoping that I could stop carrying a pen and a knife because of this combination. That's not the case. Skip the pen and go for another SAK."
1,Part does not fit 2000 civic,The bolt holes on this part do not line up with the OEM bolt holes in the body. They are all slightly off.
4,Good Book,"I wanted to learn more about his idealogy, and what went on in his crazy mind. Good book, touched alot of topics."
1,badbook,i am a libyan please dont read this book as it is full of nonsenseand contradictions mumar the dead man talks about democracy while he him self is a dictator and tyrant ....he spend millions of poor libyan people's money to make his books famous he crushs all those who oppose him he denied his peoeple freedom he pretend to live simple life while he live extravagant life he corrupts our education and medicine systemhe involved libya in terror he DRAGGED us in war with chad he support the fighers groupes in sudan and the result is sudan division he hates islam'he hates arabs he hates americans ...he is devilhis end was on the great libyan people in a revolution that stunned the world ...people ...ordinary people holding guns and anti crafts guns in an extraordinary valor .. packed by nato airstrikes ..have ended the brutal regime of mad stupid damn evil man called Qaddafi.... Qaddafi wants always to be in history....he is now in the trash of history ...
5,Detail is the stuff of magic,This book is very well researched and organized. I enjoyed looking through it and reading about the historical origins of witchcraft and pagan practices. I found this book to be exceptional! I highly recommend it for anyone interested in witchcraft for the purposes of practice or just general curiosity about religious beliefs and how they came to be.
1,Extremely inaccurate,"Despite being extraordinarily referenced, this book contains inaccuracies on almost every page. Whether it be suggesting that most witches were burned during the witchtrials (when most were hanged), or suggesting that the origins of Santa have something to do with a mushroom, this book is filled with historical misconceptions, enormous leaps of speculation presented as fact, a poor selection of source material (which also seem to have been poorly read), simplification of facts which contort them beyond recognition, and what can only be described as a willful ignorance of actual scholarship. Without doubt one of the worst books on witchcraft I have ever read"
2,Cute,"This is a fun and light-hearted encyclopedia ideal for flipping through on a rainy day that keeps you at home. It's more for younger people, teens in particular. Although it's not really a good book for the serious researcher, it is a starting point for the curious. Be aware, however, that the book lacks the traditional alphabet listing of topics in an encyclopedia, which makes it hard to find specific things you are looking for."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a bit disappointing as it is not what I expected. It's light and fluffy as opposed to being a serious research guide and informative tome. It reminds me more of a ""My first encyclopedia"" type book, something for young teens. So, if you're looking for something to flip through on a rainy day, this is an okay book. However, if you're looking for an informative guide that can provide you with the facts on witchcraft and its beliefs & practices, you'll need to look elsewhere."
4,witchcraft encyclopedia review,"This was a great historical resource. However, not too useful for creating spells."
4,A solid recommendation despite some flaws,"The author states in the introduction that she began her research with a strong opinion about celibacy: that it was unnatural. The six years she spent writing the book changed her mind on that (her current view is much more complicated). This initial judgment of celibacy obviously colors the narrative in some parts of the book, especially the early chapters.I found a handful of instances where historical information contradicted other histories I have read. I tend to trust the other sources more: Abbott was researching the practice of and attitudes toward celibacy, and likely did not spend as much time evaluating her information on other issues.But overall, this was a wonderfully complete narrative of celibacy's history all over the world, in cultures ancient and modern. The narrative draws one in, the analysis draws together disparate cultural ideas into compelling conclusions, and the book is packed full of fascinating information."
3,Biased,I found this book to be a bit biased. I felt the author's ideas and standpoints colored her facts. I would have preferred more objectivity.
4,A Great Resource For Any Christian Exploring Purity,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
5,wonderful,"This is a wonderful little book. I got it yesterday and finished it within a couple of hours. I think its obvious that human beings are sexual, & growing up in a culture that says ""do it"", its very hard to wait until marriage.But its possible, Rebecca reminded me the importance of waiting. What an encouraging book. It'll encourage you to wait until your married. Its perfect whether your in your teens, 20s or older. I'm glad that I got it. I'd like to recommend another book that's just as good ""All It's Meant to Be by Bryan Clark."""
4,It's Going Down,"In the contest of which latina diva can hold her own and maintain street cred (jlo vs angie), then angie wins hands down. this album illustrates her writing prowess, where she illustrates her life in a non-one-dimensional way. it's all realness here. she shares mic duties with various guests, but she makes sure that the focus is not taken off of her at all time. if j.lo and angie got into a street brawl, my money's on angie. can't wait for her to drop another joint on the unsuspecting public."
5,Latin Breakthrough,"Once I saw Angie on the ""Not Tonight Remix"" from the Nothing to Lose Soundtrack, I knew she had it. With her first single, ""Dem Thangz"" got me kinda curious of what she had. It was addictively well-written with lyrics you learn the 3rd time thru! My fav song on the LP is where she lays down the chorus between the INVINCIBLE rhyming of The Lox, Beanie Sigel, Brett, & the legendary Kool G Rap! Other songs she shows her latin flavor on is ""Suavamente"" with Wyclef Jean where she flows irresistably. Another is ""Live At Jimmy's"" where Cuban Link tinges the song with Puerto-Rican flavor. Songs that you will probably end up loving are ""Gutter 2 TheFancy Ish"" with Busta Rhymes, ""Mi Amor"" with Jay-Z and his ghetto rhyming, and ""Thug Love"" with Fat Joes Thugness. One track that really stands out from the rest is the skit/song ""Silly N***az"" where the girlz hit it HARD! Overall a great freshmen effort for this BABE! COp it fo sho!"
5,ANG REPRESENTED AND DID HER THING.,"Ang did her thing on this album. She has a lot of great artists that worked with her on this... Jay-Z, Busta, Wyclef, Mary J. Blige and India are just to name a few. ""Suavemente"", ""Ladies and Gents"" and ""Live at Jimmy's"" are HOT! She's got a lot of Latin Beats on there. The girl can flow. She has a great relationship with her listeners on the radio and this album definitely allows you to know and understand her. I hihgly recommend this CD. If you haven't bought it yet, what are you waiting for?"
3,Solid start 4 Angie,"This new one from angie martinez is a solid start for her first cd. Everytack here is not the best and sometimes her rhyming is not always on point. The ones that are will definetly have you on the floor in the clubs or your own place. Tracks like: ""Mi Amor"", ""Suavamente"", and ""Dem thangs"" will have you think twice about this cd. Any fans or regular listeners of Hot97 who like angie should pick this up. Her flow is kind of old school too but the beats that back her up couldnt be any better. The 3 tracks I named out are some of the best tracks I like on the album."
1,boring,"Ok, she might have fame in the US being a radio DJ but in Europe she has no start-off fame and her singles were already rather boring. It's like someone is talking over a record, not rapping. The complete album didn't convince me either."
1,i cant believe she did this,"this is without a doubt one of the worse ablums i have heard in a long long time. It is obvouis she doubted herself by saturating her album with other artist. 95% of the cuts is with others, there is no one on one. I dont blame her for trying to cash in on the Jennifer Lopez crazy but really you must show some talent on your own, lets see her make an album by herself then i can say she has talent. One must remember, just because you interview artist everyday doesnt make you one, i can say the best part of the album was the ending...becuase it was finally over."
2,sorry ma!,"I'll give her an E for effort, but a rapper she's not,I kinda feel what she's trying to do but, I just can't get with her as a rapper, if this sells,it's strictly because she's a pretty girl and she's on one of he hottest radio stations, sorry ma!"
1,SOWWY!!!,"ay ma...look...u iz hot but dam ya album, i aint feelin it...i love ya dj skillz too...but ORIGINALITY...look at FOXY she like da hottest felinez out dere right now..she come up with her own ish...angie..boo....i love you...but ya album garbage...good think i aint cop it... peace peace 1"
3,NOT BAD AT ALL.,"I bought this CD three years ago and never really listened to it because I thought it was boring at the time. The other day, I placed it into my CD changer and listened to the whole album. This CD is not as bad as I thought it was. It's a good album. As a matter of fact, I think it's a CD that will grow on you if you listen to it a couple of times. Angie doesn't really have the rhyming skills like Foxy, Kim, or Eve but she makes an attempt with some tight beats and famous producers. I see her as an female MC that needs to practice her skills a little more. I give her an ""E"" for effort. Overall, not bad."
5,Not bad.... not bad at all,"This CD is a little bit different from what I expected. But give credit where credit is due the lyrics are pretty tight, its nice for a females to talk about somethin' other than how fly they are all the time and so on. She has one song on there w/ Mary J. Bilge and I found myself listening to lyrics and sayin' ""yeah, that's right."" Most of the lyrics are really about partying and just having a good time with friends, and we need more music like that. I look forward to the release of her next CD. I just wish I didn't wait so long to cop this one, because I could've been bumpin' it in my car a long time ago."
1,Angie Martinez represents a positive force.,"With this new release by Angie Martinez, Hip Hop has finallyhit the main stream. She happens to one of the few Latina women in thepop music business having any kind of success. Although she dips into the New Yorican, Spanglish stereotype sometimes, for the most part she is someone who is a positive role model for young Latina girls. She is a successful radio DJ in an industry that has very few Latino American personalities. (Actually they are almost non-existent.) For that reason and that reason only, Angie Martinez has gained my respect."
2,No thanks....,"I'm afraid I don't see much that is redeeming in this cd. Some people like it, that's fine, I'm not sure why. I think it is poorly done and truly not worth bothering with. But if you like it, I have one for sale.As for the ""artist"", well I have deleted most all the things I already wrote about her as just personal observation. I don't know her and really don't want to.It is obvious that she is not a ganster, not a rapper, not an artist and really just a dj hoping to cash in on some local fame.So like I said, if you like this CD, I have one for sale."
2,Rocafella Bound,"Ladies and Gentleman, let's give it up for the newest member of the Roc-a-fella camp. let's be serious , Amil was garbage , so what makes you think replacing her with Angie will be any better. They are two fine hotties but this is the rap game not modeling. Should have picked up Foxy or went someone new and unsigned because basically everyone else is cliqued up. At least Foxy sounds good with Jay's ghostwriting. Angie, while hanging with the Terror Squad,please ask Remi Martin to give you some rhyming lesson MA. Peace out One."
2,OK...haven't heard it all,"haven't heard the album yet, but since artists usually release the best cuts as singles, and the best cuts suck, the album CANNOT be good. angie had one -- ONE -- bright spot on lil' kim's cut ""ladies' night,"" and even that was mediocre.anyone who thinks this album deserves more than 2 stars either:a: does not listen to hip-hop (or at least, doesn't listen to lyrics);b: is giving stars because they're happy to finally see a latina on the mic (btw, hurricane g was the first to do so).don't misunderstand: latinas in hip-hop is a good thing. i wish there were more, but not when they're this bad. angie, don't quit your day job."
1,Not Fantastic!,"I was VERY disappointed in this DVD. It is not menued (why do people continue to make dvds and not menu them???) and it is simply a collection of old 8mm films that have been put onto a disc and all are extremely blurry. Ok, you can still make out what the demonstrators are doing, but if you're going to sell a product at least warn potential customers of the quality and the lack of a menu (but then, you probably wouldn't have very many sales---hmmm)."
5,Great hard rock,"Hard Rock like it's meant to be. Powerful riffs, tight rhythm, psycho vocals. Do yourself a favor and buy this album."
4,Perfect Driving Music,"EES has been around for so long it is like they always existed. This album was their big break in the US, although they are still relatively unknown outside of certain circles - which is sad. They are a talented group with a passion for what they do and this all comes through on this release."
1,Disappointed,This brush is not good for thick hair and it causes a lot of static. I would not recommend purchasing it.
3,Bigger than expected so was unable to use it or return it or honestly rate it!,"Cant really honestly rate it, because I didn't use it. Gave it away! It was bigger than it looked in the photo............too big for what I needed but couldn't return it. It may have been a very good product. Looked like a quality brush but was just too wide and big for me!"
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a book on framing and flipped through this quickly at a local big-box store and purchased it. I should have looked more closely. It is a just a collection of articles from a magazine that are about framing. While they go into great detail on a few chosen topics - they do not discuss framing soup to nuts as I would have expected from the title (or even the quick once-through). If you are interested in some advanced techniques, this might be a valuable resource, but if you want the basics - or at least something comprehensive - look elsewhere."
2,Turkey Call - Didn't impress me much,I received the Western Rivers Electronic Turkey Call and was quite dissapointed. The Turkey Panic Call portion is useless unless you want to scare all of the turkeys out of the woods. A bigger mistake is that the Hoot Owl is not a Hoot Owl...it is a mourning dove. I couldn't believe my ears. Also the vocals from the turkey hens are too high of a pitch. I also purchased the Cass Creek electronic caller from Amazon and was much more satisfied...it was worth the extra $'s.
2,Hit and Miss,"This is a compilation of short stories from experienced crime and mystery writers, as well as relative newcomers. Indeed, it is difficult not to be entertained by the distinctive styles in Ian Rankin's ""Saint Nicked"", or Simon Brett's ""Exit, Pursued"" (bound to be a hit with Shakespeare fans), both of which lead the reader on a meandering course of false trails before their sly endings. A notable new voice is Mat Coward, whose ""Too Subtle for Me"" both utilizes and mocks existing mystery standards.On the other hand, there are many stories in the book that fall short of the complexity that is needed for a mystery/crime story; experienced mystery readers will be able to discover a large number of twists within the first paragraphs. As an example of British crime telling it is patchy, but there are spots of great fun."
2,More Horror than Mystery,"I took this book out of the library because my mom loves mysteries. But she said none of the books were really murder mysteries, and upon reading about half of the stories I agree. They are more stories of revenge and death, with very little of the traditional mystery involved. I found I didn't much enjoy reading them and didn't finish the book."
1,Not a Winner,"If you enjoy British mystery authors such as Elizabeth George, PD James, Martha Grimes,or the established Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle, and you are hoping to find similar fare in this anthology, you will be disappointed. The first story was so offensive, basically a detailed description of pedaphilia, that I tore it out of the book. I have never done this before and do not regret it. The other included stories were also disappointing."
1,First Story Too Trashy for Me!,"I bought this book because I enjoyed the Best American Short Stories, but I was sorely disappointed. The first story was so trashy in its use of gutter-level sexual language, I pitched into the trash can where it belongs! If you don't like stories that contain sordid gutter talk, forget this one."
5,Best thing I did,"I thought this review book was more than enough to prepare me to pass the AUD section of the CPA exam. I didn't take any review courses, just read the book and went over all the MC questions and simulations. Would definitely recommend, especially since it's so much cheaper than taking a review course."
4,"a good reference book, i used it along with Becker materials.","I used Wiley with my Becker review. I got 86 in November. I think Wiley book is a good reference book but it is too detail oriented, which is not necessary."
4,Very good book,"I used this book to study, and passed the CPA exam with an 89. It is thorough and should contain almost everything you need. For a few of the topics I had difficulty with, I had to go back to my college notes/textbooks for clarification. Not sure if this was a shortcoming of the book or me :)It had plenty of questions, good explanation of the answers, and many extended problems to help prepare for the test. I've seen other people complain of constant errors. I noticed a few, but nothing to prevent me from buying other Wiley books in the future (I just bought the REG book)."
4,Wouldnt have done it if it wasnt for Wiley,"Wiley tends to throw in ALL of the information you could possibly be tested on while Becker will hold your hand and teach you tons of little tricks, as well as help you schedule your study time. The Wiley books do include a chapter in the front of the book with a study outline, however I didnt waste my time with it. If you can handle a few obvious typos and are self-motivated enough to hold yourself to a schedule, then you'll make it through Wiley's books just fine. I walked out of FAR about ready to jump in front of a bus, but ended up pulling an 85, almost wetting myself. Put in the time and Wiley will not dissapoint. Any complaints i've heard about Wiley are more than offset by the price."
3,Wiley CPA Exam Review,"I totally agreed with other people saying that Wiley CPA Review MC's are much harder than Becker's. I am using both Becker and Wiley Reviews to prepare my coming BEC exam which is on Oct. 2. By studying the perviously CPA released MC's, you pretty much got some ideas what the examers expected. They expected you know all the material inside and out. If it's that case, the Wiley MCs are more realistic compare to Becker's. However, I dislike the way Wiley formats the outlets in the book. The studying contents in the Wiley's book are not detail enough to work through the MCs. I like the Becker's books that explains more details in the contents, but its MCs are not indepth enough. By using combination of these two studying reviews, we see if I can pass the BEC."
3,Wiley CPA Review,It arrived on time however it said it was new but when i got the entire cover and the first 200 pages were all bent making extremely hard to read them.
5,New and fast shipping,The book conditions were excellent and I received it fast. I liked the service. Keep that way and you will keep your clients.
3,Kids love it but watch out- read on....,"This car arrived and literally took 5 minutes to put together as most of it is assembled. The quality of components are great and it appears robust.What had me stumped was that the steering worked back to front and you needed arms like a gorilla to steer the thing. I thought this was a model and not a toy. Initially I was disappointed but under closer inspection it appears someone at the factory had assembled the steering the wrong way. I removed 2 split pins, relocated the steering arm and then fixed the arm back in with two paperclips. Works fantastically now and the kids won't get out of it."
1,Amazon's Garage mismatch,"I ordered this because the system claimed it was a match for my 1992 toyota t100. it is most definitely NOT a match, it is much longer than shown, and is the wrong shape. Mirror also arrived covered in grime, with the product packaging open inside the shipping box. It looked like someone took it off a vehicle, shoved it in the old packaging, and mailed it."
2,not tight enough to represent the cov.,"up and coming west cov artist,the city is waiting for the tru hustlas to put it down.yall didn't do it on this don't try again no lyrics no beat's period."
4,Too Close For Comfort,"Jane Jeffry is a full-time mother whose life is filled with three children, two cats, a dog, PTA and carpools. Her husband Steve is killed in an auto accident on the night he leaves home for another woman. In the midst of her grieving, Jane's life is jolted by the murder next door of Happy Helper cleaning lady Ramona Thurgood. Jane's motivation to solve the crime is if a murder can be committed in another house in the neighborhood, it can also happen in her house.Jane is helped by her friend Shelley and old family friend Uncle Jim. Together with the local police a trap is set to catch the murderer in the act.The neighborhood and the characters are believable. The plot is easy to follow. I understand why the book got both the Agatha and Macavity Awards for Best First Mystery."
4,Laugh Aloud Funny,"I had given up on Jill Churchill after I read ""Bell, Book & Scandal,"" which I can only term amateurish, but maybe her editor encouraged her to write a chicklit-style novel to get those readers to cross over into mystery... Whatever the reason for that half-hearted effort, ""Grime and Punishment"" is so much better in terms of style, humor and plot, though the plot was still a bit thin. Still, it's an amusing escapade into mundane suburban (Chicago) life centered around a bunch of car-pooling PTA moms, with astute and hilarious insights into raising kids. There is a serious side too, dealing with Jane Jeffry's marriage, which rings true, and her forray into considering dating again is believably portrayed. A good bedtime read!"
3,disappointing,"Based on the previous ratings of all the books in this series, I thought I'd enjoy the first 10 or so. Fortunately I ordered only the 1st one; I won't be getting more.I warmed up to Jane over the course of the book, but didn't much like her at first. It took a while until a reader learns why she was ambivalent about her late husband. I thought the explanation of why she & Shelley were friends despite different personalities wasn't put very well. It made it sound like anyone who lived next door would have become Jane's best friend. And how was it that she'd never, before the day the story started, seen Shelley's regular, weekly cleaning woman? There were a number of other things like this that seemed unlikely to me."
3,"Pleasant, but average cozy","Jill Churchill writes well enough, but I didn't find heroine or her friends interesting. Maybe if I lived in the 'burbs it would make a difference..."
2,THE EMINEM OF DEATH ROW,Raper Miilk Bone has been in the rap game since 1994 he realsed his hit single ``wheirz da party at`` in 94 and was dubbed the white boy with skills and then he realsed his album ``da miilkrate`` winch did not sell he then was gone from the game but then poped up on the``chornic 2000`` album and now his 2nd album ``u got miilk?`` a album wheir he disses eminem for dissing him on the song ``dear slim`` but this album ... Miilk needs better producers better lyrics a hit single and he could find fame again i think anyways
4,The Mystery of Fire and Man,"This diminuitive book contains a significant amount of useful information on which to meditate and ponder. Focusing on the role of fire, fire worship and the sun in the spiritual development of man throughout the ages, Hall explores symbolism fromm the cavement through modern Freemasonry. Tying the role of fire through to the symbol of man - including occult anatomy of the spine and brain, Hall weaves together Eastern and Western philosophies - especially around Kundalini - to discuss the role of fire within man. An interesting work by an interesting philosopher."
2,Nothing like the original manufactured item.,"What I was sent looks nothing like the picute and this item should not be advertised as it is from the original manufacturer. This is not a ""Tefal 982628"" filter. It fits the deep fryer but it is a cheap replacement. It does not have the paper which shows that the filter needs to be changed and it is two black layers with white in the middle. I guess it will work but its not what I thought I was buying."
5,Deep Fryer Filter,This was bought as a replacement filter for my deep fryer. It works well. I am planning to order another one when it comes back into stock. I recommend this for anyone who owns a Tefal Deep Fryer.
4,"First two tracks are great, last 4 are poor","I have a correction to make in my previous comment, the great tracks are: Ode to Perfume & Fragrance (they make up the first side of the record and sound like one track). The title track and Witches' Multiplication Table are terrible. Two Bass Shuffle is dull and Hiss N Listen is OK."
2,The title tells it all,"""On the way to the peak of normal"" eptly describe this album. It's the peak of Czukay's mediocore solo adventure. ""ode Perfume"" is the only memorable melody in this record, other works are full of studio technique, but without true aspiration of former Can. If you are Czukay fans, ignore my review. My review is to those who Know Czukay through his work in Early Can days. Krautrock Lovers Avoid this stuff and his later works."
3,Lots of Chicken Shooting,This game is great for chicken shooting and the graphics are great. But thats all there is. Just an east shooting game. The kids love it.
4,Neuro Road Map,Good book for reviewing and getting the big picture for a subject that is so full of detail.
4,Good study guide,"Concise, nice practice questions in each section, easy to find information. I would recommend this to my students as a study guide for final exam in Medical Neuro course."
2,Save your money,"These pens are heavily advertised to aid in cutting back on check information being changed. They may well do that, however the pens that I got won't write, the ink clots and smears and two of them won't write at all."
5,Sensational,"One of my all time favorite KY products, the fragrance is enticing and the massage oil is gentle, this can go anywhere without burning or over stimulating, a great fore play oil or shower oil. I will even rub a little on my hands and around my neck and it keeps me thinking about him all day with great anticipation in pleasing my man."
5,All The J5 You'll Ever Need,"Since J5 albums were the usual Motown hits & filler affair as well as many being out of print,Soulsation is a good investment as well as an enjoyable one(a rarity for a boxed set).Yes it includes the favorites(I Want You Back,ABC,I'll Be There)and solo tracks(Michael's Got To Be There & Ben Jermaine's Daddy's Home and even Jackie's Love Don't Wanna Leave),but it also include key album tracks which could've been hits in their own right(Stand,People Make The World Go 'Round,If I Had To Move A Mountain,All I Do Is Think Of You).It was wise to put the vault material on the fourth disc and even some should've been released (the funky cover of It's Your Thing).Even if Motown remasters and re-releases the original albums on CD(I'll be looking forward to 1972's Looking Through The Windows,a suprisingly excellent album dispite it's cookie cutter origins)they'll be hit & miss.But Soulsation,although lenghthy,will be a winner all around."
3,Not the Only CD for a True Jackson 5 Collector,"As a long time J5 fan,I was hoping to having one neat boxset with the J'5 most popular along with some of their more obscure recordings. But I was disappointed that many of the J5 hits were missing like Zip a Dee Doo Dah, Nobody, Standing in the Shadows of Love, One More Chance, Come Round Here, and True Love Can Be Beautiful. I don't think for this much money these beautiful songs should have been excluded. I recommend getting the Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 Cd along with this one. It has the songs I mentioned, you won't regret it."
5,Jacksboro Highway,"I really enjoyed this CD. I can't even imagine the wonderful sounds and creativity coming from the Parnell home during their growing up years.The harmonica, slide guitar, and vocals are excellent! My favorite songs are Jacksboro Highway and Oopin' Doopin' Doopin'.Jacksboro Highway is an outstanding song. Nicholson,Carter, Carter, and Wilson have really captured the feel of this dubious geographic location. The magnificent soulful delivery of LeeRoy, Rob Roy, and Waylon Jennings, places the listener right in the middle of this stretch of 199.Oopin Doopin Doopin is just plain fun!My thanks to all involved in this wonderful CD."
3,Youth & Young Manhood - The Jury's Still Out,"I bought this album almost a year ago, and I still don't know what I think about it. Even though I have thoroughly liked every single released by Kings Of Leon, I found the album...didn't satisfy my appetite enough. Sure, it contains a fair good amount of decent little choons, but it just wasn't fantastic. I felt at most it made for good background music. I found the songs, while containing technical skill, good lyrics and a fine melody, unmemorable, which is a shame really.Never mind, maybe they can blow me away with their second album."
3,Trying too hard?,"A pretty good album. Maybe what Lynyrd Skynrd would have been like if they came out in 2003 instead of the seventies. It's a decent listen, but is not for everyone. I enjoyed it better the second time after waiting about a month in between listens.A word of caution: the copy I have has copy protection and cannot be burned."
5,one of my fav,i am a very specific person about muci i like abnds i can listen to thier songs over and over and not get bored with thier album kings of leon is my favorite album beside and rage against the machine album thier worth every cent spent on the cdi suggest you go and buy it now or maybee in five minutes. Also try the bands : black keys BRMC and Eels and the new pornographers
4,Not just the Southern Strokes,"This is a great album - short and to the point, and most importantly, full of emotion. When you hear a good rock song, by the end of it, you know the lead singer is exhausted, and that's how you feel when you listen to Kings of Leon. That's also one area that really sets them apart from The Strokes. Now, the Strokes are a good band too, but they just don't get into the music the way the Kings of Leon do. Just see them live and you'll understand. This is real rock n roll with some southern flavor and a lot of energy. Plus they're all related and they have mustaches, and that has to count for something. I hope they have a nice, long career ahead of them."
4,Great CD,"I think a lot of people are really missing out on what makes this band so good. One word: honesty. There isn't one ounce of pretentiousness on this record. It's all coming straight from the heart. I mean he isn't a great singer, they're not great players, but it all comes together great. But all being of the same family there is sure to be some underlying rhythm. And the tunes are just great. I mean each tune will definitely put you in mind of an earlier band, like the Stones or Tom Petty or the Allman Brothers, but these guys have boogie and they have shake. That deep South boogie and shake mind you. A real ballsy, bluesy kind of thing you don't learn from a book or music lessons. I'm talkin' the take the shoes off, roll down the stockin's, spread the cornmeal on the dancefloor, and get down boogie. As far as I'm concerned any music that makes you want to shake your hips is good stuff. At times ya want to stand up and testify!"
4,Give this a shot,"This album can be considered a country or southern rock album, but in many ways it's also a top-notch garage band album. It's a mix of Creedence and Skynyrd type southern rock, mixed with your favorite garage bands, including the Stooges. In fact, on sometimes the lead singer very much reminds me of a junior Iggy Pop, especially when he starts wigging out near the end of some songs. The country/southern rock influence is definitely stronger than the garage influence, and that gives the band a familiar, yet very unique sound. All in all, this album is a great, hard-rocking and gritty album. The strings arrangements and fingerpicking are great, and there are plenty of hooks and riffs to keep your feet tapping and your head nodding."
5,Amazing.,"This band is truly amazing. I've seen them live and hot damn. They're really passionate about their music and it shows. The prettiest track on the CD is California Waiting, a song about the record industry. Another great song that makes you just wanna kick people is Molly's Chambers. Another tune on there you should also check out is Wasted Time. Again, GREAT BAND. If you're debating whether to buy it or not - BUY IT."
2,Inbred Rock,"Hey guys, here's a clue. If you got a family that can really write and play some great music but ain't nobody can sing a lick, then you gotta go outside your kin.This band has the potential to be outstanding but I listened to 4 cuts from ""Youth and Young Manhood"" and switched CD's - the vocals are audibly painful. Imagine R.E.M. with Ozzy instead of Michael Stipe."
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap...and even more Crap","This is the WORST! WORST! WORST! I saw these guys open up for The Strokes (go head and say something, i don't care, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING...although they were el-lame-o live). These guys try to cash in on 70's retro rock, but it is evident that they don't know a damn thing about it (music wise) and look and rock out like the emo tools that they really are. You want the real deal buy some Cactus. And if you want something with a modern flair, support a good band that can actually play live and kick out the jams...Nebula is my choice. That was the worst 35 minutes I've ever had to stand through...and i wasn't even sober...wink-wink. good lookers(not by my standards though) don't make a good band. Hopefully, I've helped you all. There are plenty of other bands who write catchy songs and are good eye candy too...choose wisely. peace."
1,I hate this band so much.,"Seriously, these guys are awful. They're boring, predictable, and they look like the rejected cast of That 70s Show. I don't know if they think of what they wear is genius or not, maybe it was 40 years ago. When I first heard ""Molly Chambers"" on the radio, I asked myself, ""who allows this crap?"" The singing is awful (completely monotone) the whole song is the same, boring struggle, and the solo sounds like the guitar player just woke up from a drinking binge the night before. I hate these guys. Just stop the music, please, god."
1,Suck,"I know nothing about the albums, but saw these guys live with U2 on Thursday and they suck. Everytime the lead singer opened his mouth to sing, we cringed. He is like fingernails on a chalkboard. The band is actually ok, music wise, if the lead singer would shut up. If you go to U2, try to get reserved seats so you can skip this band. We were in general admission and didn't want to lose our spot close to the stage so we sufferred through this noise."
5,"Band of the decade,no contest.","All bow down, the kings of leon are taking over. From the first note of red morning light to the last syllable of holy roller novocaine, this album just hits the not perfectly.By the time you have listened to this album 3 times you will never want to take it out for about a month.10 of the 11(i have a british copy) are superb,Caleb has a different voice admittedly,and maybe a bit thick, but the tune works for it.Genius is the song of 2003,no contest. Kings of Leon are the band of 2003, and I hope for a long time to come."
3,A 3.5 really,"They're skilled and people like 'em and all, I just don't think the stuff is that compelling. I like it but it doesn't make me a fan."
3,Kings of Leon bring back the southern boogie,"I was interested in this album months before it came out after I read that the band members are sons of a Southern preacher. Knowing that world, I knew that musicians bringing that perspective would either really get it right or sound like cut-rate Black Crowes rip-offs. They really got it right - the laid-back Southern vibe, the boogying rhythm section, the slack-jawed, lazy vocals. At their best, on ""Happy Alone,"" KoL bring back and update the catchy, New-Wave-Southern slacker sound of Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers from ""American Girl."" Elsewhere, as on ""Holy Roller Novacaine,"" they sound like the insolent guys I grew up with - the Other South, the one that didn't like country music, thought ""redneck"" was a compliment, and believed with every fiber of their beings that mullets were sexy."
3,Southern Fried? Garage-Psych? Try 70's New Wave-Post Punk,"With the exception of a few vague Dickey Betts-like guitar licks, the music on this album owes more to Elvis Costello's ""This Year's Model"" and similar 70's British ""new wave/post-punk"" rockers (Joe Jackson, Graham Parker) than anything by Zeppelin or Skynyrd. In fact, imagine ""This Year's Model"" with a stoned, mellowed out, Elvis Costello singing with bad head cold and you got this album pegged. Chances are many reviewers here were not even born when the late 70's post-punk era was in full stride and have no idea what I'm talking about. So a little history, Costello's ""This Year's Model"" is arguably one of the best albums to come of that era (if you don't have it, get it); the fact the ""King's"" music sounds similar is really a compliment to the ""Kings"". Regardless, this is an okay album with nothing really original to offer. If you must, at least look to buy this one in the zShop and save a few bucks."
2,Overated band with a good publicist,"Kings of Leon has timed their arrival on the music scene brilliantly. 3 years ago this album would have gotten 2 stars from every reviewer. Now it's cool to be ""raw"" and every album with this sound is highly reviewed . The trouble here is that this band isn't raw in the stripped down sense, but rather raw in the lack of talent sense. The songs aren't great, the band is pretty average, and the vocals by Caleb are completely incomprehensible. On what level is it cool to intentionally slur your vocals?Yes, they're from the south and have seventies haircuts. No, their music is not even close to on par with great southern rock bands of the seventies. Other than their retro southern seventies image this is a truly unremarkable band."
3,Musical puberty,Clearly a work in progress- the extra gritty debut from these young hellbillies seemed a little overanxious to prove just how authentic it thought it was- but carries lazily energetic swagger with ease throughout.
2,Halfway there,"This album has great energy - somewhere between the Doors and the Clash, but song quality is uneven. Molly's Chambers and Spiral Staircase are good. Unfortunately, the version of California Waiting is sub-par and sounds as if the band wasn't fully there. I definitely want to hear more from Kings of Leon, but I'll be holding my breath that it'll be good."
3,"It really is the Southern Strokes, guys.","That's not a bad thing at all, but it's the most concise way to say it. I almost gave it 4 stars but it felt just a little too short (even though there's a nice hidden track). The whole album grooves well. I've played it like 5 times in the past few days and it's still a fun listen. Still, there's way too much hype about this band."
3,"This ain't southern rock - still decent, though","Before I get too far, I'll say that the CD is not bad at all. Good not great. Now I must say that I don't get the ""southern rock"" tag at all. Maybe they want to emphasize the ""southern"" part to separate them from bands like The Strokes. But don't expect to hear anything southern (maybe ""Joe's Head"" and ""Trani"", and the bluesy ""Dusty"" ?). To me, southern rock has some element of twang, especially in the vocals. It's absent here.It sounds a lot like early '70s glam such as T. Rex, Lou Reed, Stooges-lite, Bowie (most vocals are like an aggressive Bowie, and as other reviewers have noted, aren't for everyone)and also sounds a bit like late '70s/early '80s new wave/punk.Check out the Drive-by Truckers if you are looking for contemporary southern rock."
4,Simply Rocking,"The only thing keeping this from being a five star review is the presence of too many similar drum cadences (they're obviously big fans of the intro to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers American Girl). The Strokes comparisons I've heard seem to be a little off the mark. This is lo-fi, simple 3 chord rock, true, but the Strokes seem a little whiny compared to this. The Kings strut with a little more confidence, as heard in the low register, camels-n-jack vocals. The voices, combined with a muscular rhythm section and ragged-edge guitars remind me a bit of earlier Urge Overkill, where it sounded like the whole train could derail at any second. The whole CD is fairly riveting from start to finish, with ""California Waiting"" and ""Molly's Chambers"" leaping out at me on first listen. Maybe the notes aren't original, but the way they're put together sounds fresh enough to me."
4,Very good music,"I think you should go buy this CD. It's great. It reminds me a little bit of the Strokes album, 'Is This It', not only because the music is alike, but in that you can listen to it all the way through."
2,they are alright,I finally got around to hearing this Disc recently&while it has some moments that are good I wasn't feeling like i was hearing a 2nd-Coming of anything quite yet.having said that they have a chance if they grow with each release they do.they don't make me think of alot of the Bands out now&that is a Good thing.in time we shall see what they have.right now they are alright with plenty of room for Growth&More Depth.
3,Southern Rock,This has a mix of southern rock-Punk even some country and almost hip hop sounding lyrics.I guess it is a okay albumLyrics 5/10 Production 8/10 Music 6/10 Style 7/10 Voice 9/10Overall=35/50 Chris guide gives it 3.5 stars round to 3 stars
2,Pass on this hyped band.,"If you like this group you won't like my review. These guys are overrated. I just don't get the hype about this band. It seems most people are caught up in their now famous upbringing. Mythical hoohah! Look this isn't southern rock. These guys are a lame boogie band. All mumbling and murky,I keep waiting for something to rise up out of this muck but it never kicks in. The only saving grace for my two feeble stars is the song California Waiting. There are plenty of other great new bands out there with a southern rock background who get it ,It being the southern thing. Bands like Drive By Truckers and the Bottle Rockets get it with intelligence and humor. Plus they ROCK!!Save your money check and out the Truckers or the Bottle Rockets or the White Stripes or Rancid or the Wrens or anyone else..."
2,It's all hype I tell you! HYPE!,"I first became aware of the Kings of Leon when I read an article on them a few months ago. Then I heard a few tracks off their EP at a local record store and decided to buy this album. Two of the store clerks told me my money would be well-spent on something else. Unfortunately, their advice went unheeded. No, the Kings of Leon are not the Southern Strokes in a musical sense; but they are similar in the fact they both received a generous portion of praise from the music press. There are a couple of really good songs on here (""Joe's Head"" and ""California Waiting"" particularly stand out), a few allright tunes and the rest are subpar. I would have given this album only one star, but it deserves two since it is better than about 75% of any other recent releases I have heard. And after reading this review, someone out there still decides to purchase ""Youth & Young Manhood"" I would seriously advise that person to look around for a used copy"
4,most exciting southern band in a looong time,Not since Blind Melon has a southern band come along with so much promise (let's hope they can stick around longer than Shannon Hoon). You won't regret having this CD -- full of raw garage power mixed w/ beautiful southern melodies.
5,Alaskana at it's most prime,Having known Art during the writing of these great stories I can honestly say that Art lived this life and it's a shame to see these people and times going away to a more civilized manner. He was a story telling legend in the cannery on Kodiak Island where he worked for years before heading to the mainland. We can call ourselves lucky indeed that he's taken the time to write them down and I can only hope there's a sequel. Anyone who reads about these genuine characters will have them tucked away in their hearts forever. They're that memorable told in the un- paralleled stlye that will forever be Genuine Barlow.
3,Josephine Cox,"This author was recommended to me by an English lady because of my love for Catherine Cookson books. I was hoping for more, but found the book mediocre and I will not read this author again. The book wasn't awful, I just wasn't into it."
4,Mary J Blige 2001,"Remember when Mary popped on the seen way back in 92? This album brings back that feeling. Not only can Sunshine sing, the beats are good too. SHe does a good job with the ballads (""Crazy Love"" and ""Last Night"" are great), as well as the uptempo(Heard It..., Lunch or DInner). If there is one problem with the album, I have to say that it is the arrangement of the songs. The ballads are all together and the up-tempos are all together. Solution, put your player on shuffle so the CD doesn't play in order. Just when I was ready to give up on new artists, she comes along and spreads sunhine to the game. SO grab your sunblock or tan lotion and soak up some sun rays."
5,Sunshine!!!,"This CD was and is the BOMB! I play Sunshine's cd at home, at work, in my truck and anywhere somebody has a cd player. #8 IS MY FAVORITE SONG, SAVE THE DAY. I wish I had someone like that. I COULD GO ON AND ON. I recommend everybody get this HOT A$$ CD. My favorite tracks are #8, #14, #15, #12,#4 and #16 and last but not least #17, the Spoken Word. Keep up the great work Sunshine. I was upset I didn't see you more on TV. The radio could have pumped you up more also!"
3,"I like Sunshine, but.....","I liked ""Heard It All Before"" the first time I heard it, and I was looking forward to getting the album. I'm not downing Sunshine's talent, but she needs better material. The songs on this album didn't do anything for me. The only reason I listened to the whole thing is because, well, I listen to every CD I buy at least once. I love her voice, and I hope she gets better material next time around. I'm still a fan."
3,Heard It All Before,"Unfortunately it does sound like I heard it all before. I think there is some talent here but her choice of material and her choice of delivering that material (her vocal style) is not going to distinguish her or bring her to the forefront for very long if at all. If you like her that's good, but this CD isn't going to hit you over the head and say ""Wow!"" I do like the CD cover and she does look sincere."
3,Sunshine has potential for better albums,"When I heard ""Heard it all before"" I was so excited and I went to buy the album. However, other than the club hit, this is a average album at best. Hopefully Sunshine can pick it up on her next album or she'll be a new one hit wonder."
1,One hit blunder,"I purchased this CD on the strength of a terrific single, ""Heard it all Before"" and Sunshine's association with the very talented Macy Gray. I must say, I am very very disappointed. Sunshine's voice is marginal at best and the songwriting is inane. I'm trying to figure out how I will dispose of this utter waste of money. This just isn't a very good CD at all. Trust me."
1,Big Dissapointment,I thought that this album was going to be the bomb but it totally ...! The only good song on the album is 'Heard it All Before'. There may be two other songs that grow on you but that is it. The lyrics are great but the rythms and melodies are skrewed. All the songs sound almost the same and her voice never really changes.... I think sunshine needs to collaborate with some other producers next album because this one bombed bad.
4,A Lil Sunshine,I wish I could hear more...But I was in atlanta Recently and the record store was jammin' Sunshines' CD and it really sounded very very good. Her vocal presence is strong and infectious. Go 'head Girl.
2,"It's not the best, but it can do.","I think this record is getting way too much praise for this material that she put out. I like the title song. I am feelin that. ""Your Woman"" and ""Letting Down My Guard"" are good songs to me. I also like ""A Little Sunshine."" Simply for the fact that she can do something positive and not all of these ""I love you..."" and ""I hate you..."" songs, see ""I Heard It All Before!"" Move on."
2,Yep...heard it all before!,"I agree with Eric, who reviewed this CD, like him I find this CD not too attractive. Other than the hit song ""heard it all before"", Sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album. The sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor, which could be labeled as ""light cuisine"". As for me I need a couple of calories to make me feel good. I would not dare to compare her to Kelly Price, she might have a potential, but she's still got a long way to go to get there."
4,Surpassing her attempt to be the next Hip Hop Soul Princess,"This is one of the better r&b albums out on the market today. She is a mix of Mary J. Blidge with a smoothed out attitude. The title track down to the first single ""Heard it all before"" are making a statement of who, where, and what times she is living in. The probable next cut to be out as a single should be ""Letting Down My Guard"". A Str8 mix of jazz samples and her smoothed out approach, sounding similar to MJB more than any other cut on the album. What is so nice about this album is that it does not rely wholly on samples, guest appearances etc. Pretty much the gimicks of promoting a new artist these days. She is weighing on her own merits. Truly a solid debut album."
2,May not play on PC,"I purchased this CD to add to my MP3 library. It did not play on my PC so I could not add it to iTunes. It did play in my DVD player but that is not the way I listen to my music. It was shipped from outside the US and it might be a compatibility issue. My comment is not about CD content, I like the CD. I am just sorry that I cannot add it to my library."
5,ONE OF THE YEARS BEST,"tO EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO HATE LET THEM. tHIS ALBUM IS GREAT.THIS ALBUM HAS SOUL AND ITS BETTER THAN THAT OTHER GARBAGE BEING PLAYED ON THE RADIO NOW A DAYS. THIS ALBUM IS IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. TO EVERYONE WHO SAYS THIS ALBUM IS NOT GOOD, DOES NOT KNOW GOOD MUSIC. i JUST HOPE THAT SHE COMES WITH MORE SOUL NEXT ALBUM THOUGH, CAUSE SHE GOT THAT SOULLOVE U SUNSHINE"
2,Singers Are Not What They Used to Be,"I wouldn't even put Sunshine Anderson in the same category as Kelly Price, Jill Scott or Faith Evans because those women could sing circles around Sunshine Anderson. I guess now-a-days you don't really have to know how to ""sing"" to be a singer. that's really sad..."
4,Slept On Lovely,"Sunshine Anderson was definitely slept on her album. She had great songs with meaningful lyrics, good production, but she lacked promotion. I think if she was marketed better she would've pushed more units. Standout tracks are "" Where Have You Been"", ""Crazy Love"", ""Lunch or Dinner"", and ""Your Woman"". Sunshine has lots of soul, which is lacking in the industry right now all she needs is good people behind her and her career will certainly take off. Please don't count Sunshine out."
3,I'd rather chill out on Moonshine....,"A fair Debut, but quite a letdown. I threw it on 'random' last night presuming ""Heard it All Before"" was the tip of a dynamite iceberg I'd discovered, but no such.Buy something else, enjoy this via airplay."
1,Avon should be ashamed!,"No star!!!! My bathroom nightlight gives off more light than this ""light up mirror"" truly a ripoff."
1,no difference,had my dog on this stuff for a month or so. didn't notice any difference at all. definitely not worth recommending.
5,My dog has a new lease on life,My dog has severe gastrointestinal issues. Lots of diarrhea and vomiting. My vet put him on these enzymes and it literally changed my dog and his quality of life. After being on these for about a week I realized how poorly my dog actually felt. He stopped having all symptoms in short order. Had a better appetite. No diarrhea. Was playful and bouncy. He was HAPPY ! I just sprinkle a few capsules on his dry food a couple of times a week . He will remain on these for life. I have recommended this product to other friends with similar doggie issues and they have all had remarkable success with this product as well. It is much cheaper on Amazon then at my vet too
1,don't get this printer,"i got this printer as a gift, and i'm sure it didn't cost very much. first off, although the printer's cheap, the replacement ink cartridges each cost about $30. i've had it for about six months w/ only occasional use and i already need a new ink cartridge. it also messes up the colors, sometimes printing only in yellow, sometimes only red, and sometimes only blue or green. i read something about having to clean the cartridge, which i guess i'll look into, but the fact is the printer itself really doesn't work very well. the ""auto sheet feeder"" is supposed to load multiple sheets for you, but on my printer it just didn't work and would cause it to jam, so i had to load each individual page which was definitely annoying. also, it had this weird bug where sometimes it would print the first few lines of the text and then skip to the middle of the page and resume printing for no apparent reason. i'm a computer programmer so i know shoddy workmanship when i see it. avoid this one."
2,"Useless in color, barely OK BW","My Z13 just died this month, aged about 5 years (3 of relatively frequent use, 2 of mostly sitting on the shelf).While I appreciate the relatively long life, this would not have been a printer I'd have bought for myself: it came with the wife before my marriage :), and I had it thrown out without much sorrow.The good things: works with Mac and PC, relatively easy setup, once you learn to load the pages just right you can print on both sides. Small footprint.The bad: color printing basically makes no sense on this printer, unless you enjoy the various shades of the rainbow coming out unexpectedly. BW printing is too expensive as $30 per cartridge is the usual price for not too many pages. If you do not use the printer heavily, the ink basically dries out, and your $30 goes to waste. Plastic paper guides eventually fell off.All in all, this printer is classic case where you buy something cheaply and pay for it later."
3,Hass' first poetry book,"Field Guide is Robert Hass' first volume. An experimental assortment of poetry that uses images of the California landscape, as well as images of everyday life, as a form of meditation. Interesting poems, thought provoking and strangely positive. The poems also explore many forms and through them Hass is looking for his voice."
5,Cat Tracks,"Jeoffry takes us on a wondrous journey through the secretive world of the forest. Readers and listeners will feel the quiet as they track each adventure -- riding, jumping, climbing, wandering and finally flying!Through a symphony of words and illustrations, Bryant and Sayles take us to that lost land where snow and stars merge, and animals feast like kings.Children and their parents will love the peaceful and drifty feeling that Jeoffry's Christmas provides, as rhythmic and dream-like images ""dance in their heads."" Striking a balance between man and nature, Jeoffry leaves us in perfect harmony."
2,Wasn't what I wanted,"This had nothing to do with the seller, I was looking for different information, about Erica's old patterns, and it did not have what I wanted in it"
5,The very best,A hard item to find at most stores but Amazon has just about everything. An excellent past wax miracle for wood working.
2,Overwhelming solvent odor,"I noticed a really strong solvent smell upon application of this wax. Left the window open and fan on the wax and went out for 4-5 hours. Came back and still really strong solvent smell. Next morning still very strong solvent smell.What's up with this, I thought this was wax?While the ingredients are not listed on the can, SC Johnson does post the ingredients on its website, and also goes beyond the call of duty and points you to different environmental and toxicology databases.However, in the end, I will not buy this product again because it does contain a solvent (deodorized naptha). While I'm not an expert at understanding the scientific literature, it does seem to have long term effects on the nervous system.Instead I just bought some hard paste wax from Bioshield, #32. It contains Beeswax, Linseed Oil, Orange Peel Oil (d-limonene), Isoaliphatics, Carnauba Wax, Bees Wax, Larch Resin, Essential Oils, and Lead-free Dryers (Zircon, Cobalt Octoat)."
5,classic and still great,"I did not know that Johnson still made this product--I remember my family using this 50 years ago. We bought to used with an old solid cheery dining room table. Best description: WOW! When waxing the table, I follow the advice of using a paper towner for the final buff. Great product."
5,WOW,You will be amazed at the difference this wax will make in your furniture! Effective for use on antique wood furniture as well as modern.
2,Damaged in transit,"Mine came damaged as other reviewers stated. The shipping box had a smell similar to gasoline and was nearly saturated as it sat in the mailbox. I opened it and found the product to be separated into a liquid on top and a gelatinous mixture beneath similar to vaseline. I don't believe that stirring it will re-incorporate the liquid. The product still has a very strong gasoline smell and couldn't imagine using this anywhere but outdoors or in the garage.I've used some of the vaseline like substance on my cast iron tools and it hasn't prevented all rust from appearing so I'm going to move on to something else. It may work if it had not been left with the lid cracked for a week in the heat and separated, but I'm not going to try for another one."
2,John Paste Wax,The product works but it did smell for several days which was annoying because the whole house stinks for days.
5,great corn shucker,"If you like corn that tastes like it was just pulled from the field, this is the gadget for you!!! It makes taking the kernels off the cob very easy and makes a great cream style corn that you can easily freeze and keep in the freezer for up to a year. I often mix the cream style with whole kernel to use in soups. It sure makes corn 100% better than frozen ears or from a can!!! The gadget comes with little indents on the bottom so it can hug the bowl or pan while you are cutting off the kernels so that it stays in place. I rate this gadget a 5 stars for people who love corn!!!"
2,Not stainless steel,"When I ordered this item I thought it was the stainless steel one. I had ordered the stainless steel one several times before. It is great, but this one is flimsy and unsteady."
1,"mish,mash, mush","Doesn't matter which blade you use, this corn cutter just cuts off half the kernels. You end up running the cob through a second time and by then you have mush. Tried four different corn peelers including this one before finding one that really did the job."
1,$10 and $7 shipping?,"I don't care how good it is. When the shipping/handling cost is 70% of the cost of the unit, why buy it?"
1,Great hose NOT NOT NOT,"I actually had a curly hose for many years that I purchased when I first bought my MH. Someone stole it from my site up in Oregon. I had actually taken the MH out for the day and left the hose attached to let people know I would be back. I guess that wasn't the wisest thing to do. Anyhow, I couldn't find another for months and had to use the reguarl 25 foot white hose. What a pain that is. This stores in a small containter that I keep all my water related things in and is so much neater looking at the campsite. I would recommend this product whole-heartedly.WARNING WARNING WARNINGAfter using this hose for three RV trips of one week each, on the fourth trip I hooked it up and it looked just like a sprinkler system. There were large cracks every inch or so along the entire hose. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE HOSES!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Short Lifetime,I really liked this hose until it developed small pin holes because it didn't kink and it was handy. Only had it this summer and it has several pin holes in it. It is stored inside a shed and so it wasn't even the sun. Do not recommend.
1,Not good!,I only got 3 uses in my 5th wheel before it broke. On my 4th use it had multiple pinhole leaks along what looks like the seam on the inside of the diameter. Too bad because it did coil nicely.
5,You Have to Live The Party Life to Understand It!,"I love this book! It picks up where Cameron's crazy, quirky sense of humor left off in her last Bad Girls Guide. The Party Life inspires you to take your Bad Girl attitude to the next level --and take it out on the town. Some of the parties are hilarious, some just plain fun and sassy, others are too bad to be true! I can't decide which party to throw (or overthrow) first. I bought this as a gift but I think I'm going to keep it for myself!"
2,A Bad Girls Guide to Getting a Stupid Book Published,"This book is a complete waste of time. I am shocked at how many good ratings it has got. I have read two other books in the A Bad Girl's Guide to Series ""The Bad Girls Guide to the Open Road"" and ""The Bad girls guide to Getting what you want"". They were both excellent. This book however, seems a shameless excuse to cash in on the good will the earlier books in the series had generated.Shame on you Cameron Tuttle.And enough already with ""the 1000 of things to do with toilet roll"" routine - the ideas were not that good in the first place let alone good enough to be featured in every title in the series."
2,Pretty & Pretty Stupid,"I'd never read any of the other ""Party Girl..."" books when I got a copy of this. After buying this, I won't buy any of the others. It has no real content, just lots of mindless dribble. I thought it would at least be funny, but the train of thought trails off constantly. It's too stupid to be funny. The only thing I really liked was the sparkly silver cover. This is a book that you look at in the bookstore and leave there."
5,This is a great book,"Unlike some of the other reviewers I absolutely loved this book. I found it hilarious and charming. Swell is the type of girl many strive to be, a classic Audrey Hepurn. I am appalled that people refer to it as ""dumb"" or ""banal"", for this is not a book meant to be highly intellectually thought provoking making the nearest Nobel laureate feel like a dummy. It is meant to be taken by a modern female with a smile, not a scowl. A swell girl is not rigid, she enjoys life and does what makes her happy. That should never be looked down upon. This book is something that I recommend to all forward thinking young females."
2,Eh. Cute -- amusing even but a little light on useful info.,"The book's authors keep their sassy _sex_in_the_city_ tone throughout, but unless you're a denizon on manhatten, I'm not sure how useful this book can actually be. Maybe I'm not glamourous enough for this book. I suppose it did make me strive for more glamour in my life, but when I set the book down and realized my fully suburban existence, the book came up short with truly translatable wisdom. A cute gift for a gal just leaving college. At 28, I was far too aged for this one."
3,"Points for swell style, but a little short on swell info","The tone is appropriately light and breezy and the be-yourself-you-fabulous-thing philosophy a welcome change from women's media exhorting their readers to change. But I could've done with some pointers to more swell resources (drink recipes, swell shoe stores, Icons of Swell, etc.) and fewer stories about how fabulously swell the two writers were.One is left with the impression that it's easy to be swell if you're a arty black-clad New York girl; this book could've used a little broader scope than SoHo."
4,light & witty,"Think of a female Dean Martin, & you've got this book. Entertaining, fluffy, & on ocassion genuinely useful."
2,Cuter than a Shi-Tzu in a tiara and pearls...,"Cute, colorful, shiny and completely at odds with my life.The concept is terrific. Live a SWELL, glamorous life. Why, you can even buy the accessories to go with the book for a SWELL gift basket.However, honestly, how many people are going to live life even a tenth like this book?Read this for fun at the bookstore and save your money for something else."
2,Silly overpriced book,"This book is not that funny, and the info falls short--most smart girls will already know these so called tips."
5,fun book to give someon who is single or getting married,I feel this book bring back the humor and sex appeal of how to live a swell life. Plus it gives great tips and make you feel like it's wonderful to be a girl.
4,Life is Swell,"Love this book. It's not an Emily Post manners book and it doesn't try to be one. It's more lighthearted advice on how to carry yourself with style and class. It's a great graduation gift for any swell girl, too!"
1,Suprisingly Boring!,"When I bought this book I thought I was in for a treat, especially because of all the positive reviews I read here. What I wasn't expecting was a bunch of pages of useless blabber about parties and fashion and how much I should tip a hairstylist. It was advice a la Heloise. I will NEVER use this information. Don't waste your $."
1,Girls: don't be fooled,"I first saw this book on display at Nordstrom. Being a lover of fashion and literature, I thought this would be a cute read and feed my knowledge of fashion and girly stuff while I'm at it. Boy, was I fooled. This book does nothing but tell you useless information on boring subjects such as tipping and last-minute dinner parties. You can hardly relate to the little stories that Cynthia and Ilene put in, and they sometimes are an even bigger turn-off than the lame-o etiquette tips and party ideas. Also, no offense to Cynthia and Ilene who are probably nice gals, but they just aren't the right people to be writing this book. Save your money. If you want style, try a Vogue fashion book, or if you want interesting and USEFUL etiquette, check out Emily Vanderbilt. Thumbs down on this one."
1,Don't buy this book if you are a mom,My daughter is a senior in college. I thought this would be a cute gift. I was wrong. It is a poorly written book with no useful advice.
3,Not Exactly a SWELL Read,"I agree with the first few reviewers when they say that the ""INFO"" in the book is stuff many well-read and well-traveled women ALREADY KNOW! It is absolutely perfect for those SEX IN THE CITY WANNA-BE'S who live vicariously thru Cosmopolitan Magazine...Cynthia ROwley should just stick to what she knows best...Designing clothes!"
1,[STINKS],"I have to admit, I only bought this book because I collect etiquette books and the authors were frequently quoted in the fashion magazines I read ... I'd return the book but the effort isn't worth the additional expense and I already invested enough ...I found the advice incomplete and superficial, there are actual moments where the authors change subjects mid sentence and don't return to finish the thought or the advice, where was the editor? While I'm sure the authors are really hip and throw great parties I think they hire people for the important details, maybe they should have hired those same people to provide the very important details for this book"
2,kinda stupid,"this book does contain SOME useful advice, like the usefully detailed section on tipping & 'duking' for services received, but most of this ""useful"" advice is probably already well known to you (who hasn't disguised & dressed up take out or store-bought food for last-minute guests?).I recommend you buy it used."
5,O' To Be A Swell Girl!,"This book is fabulous. What a riot...and, yet, SO helpful. Anything and everything you ever needed or wanted to know. And, it's done with such humor and sophistication. This book answers any entertaining, traveling, dating, smooching, being fabulous on a mintues notice, and disaster question you can think up. This is the best resource out there for all single (or married, actually) ladies who are at a loss of what do do when life throws you a curve ball. Heads up...this is a classic in the making!"
1,Bright and shiny with nothing inside,"This book is poorly-written, poorly-organized, and full of advice we already know or that can be gleaned from other, more substantial sources. Another review suggested you read this in the bookstore and save your money for something more worthwhile. I think that's a great idea."
3,Not for teenage girls,"This book is more for adult women, not teenage girls. Amazon has it listed under teenage girls. Don't buy it for a teenager, you'll be disapointed, but adults will enjoy it!"
4,Fletch for President,"In this installment, Fletch goes to work for an American Presidential candidate after a murder in his campaign hotel. Along the way we get a lot of unique Fletch insights into the political process. This book would have made a much better sequel for the original Fletch movie than the idiotic ""Fletch Saved."" Overall, an excellent entry in the Fletch saga."
3,"Nothing special, but enjoyable nonetheless","Like the overpraised but not terribleThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this is a murder mystery second and a celebration of a newspaper man first. Fletch goes to work for a presidential campaign. The majority of the book talks about the scrutiny of the campaign trail, the little gestures that get blown out of proportion and the camraderie of the journalists. There are women dying throughout the book but they seem secondary to the main plot which consists of putting Fletch on the opposite side of investigative journalism as the guy who has to keep the floodgates closed.The mystery feels like a cheat since Fletch doesn't work out the murderer's identity so much as stumble on it and there's a tired little bit at the end where Fletch tries to save someone from the murderer."
3,Good replacement part put missing pieces,The thermostat itself is very good and a great replacement part. The bad part with this item is it does not come with the thermostat housing gasket or the o-ring that hold it in place. The description should have advised that it does not come with the other parts needed to install the product. Otherwise a good part.
3,A Kid's Coloring Book,"Like the companion book ""Northwest Native Arts: Creative Colors 1"" this book is designed and written as a child's coloring book, this too gives a good overview of the symbology and importance to the Pacific North West Indians of each of the animals selected to ""color"" in. The legend in the front of the book explains the color scheme(s) and provides an outline of each animal on the following pages for a child to color. It gives wonderful examples of the artwork for a child to learn a bit about these symbols. However; if you are looking for an in-depth analysis of the symbology of the Northwest Indian arts or a ""how-to"" book, this would not be a good book for you. I wish I had known this was a ""coloring book"" before I bought it as I would have passed it over for something more detailed!"
5,the greatest talent since Jaco Pastorius,"the greatest talent since Jaco PastoriusHadrien is Weather Report music in his soul, even he was hardly born when the Band Weather Report stopped playing. Hadrien has got Joe Zawinuls and Wayne Shorters idea, what Weather Report music is all about in his bones"
2,Not What I Expected,"I was expecting a discussion of Praxiteles and his work. The is really a play about Praxiteles. I did not think that the item description made this very clear.If you like plays you may enjoy this (although I did not). If you are working for a biography of Praxiteles or a catalogue of his work, keep looking.Note that this is an OCR edition of an older work. It appears that there was no effort made to clean up the OCR. As a result, while much of the text is readable, text like5.1 $cenel.to of ]j)raritrlra.is all too common."
5,Perfect for my task,"I fill these 2 dishes with flour, salt, butter; the three things I need the most when I'm cooking.They are attractive and certainly keeps handy some of the elements that are in constant demand.Neat, attractive, easily cleaned............jm"
4,Latex Fantasies/City Whips,"""A visual exploration of fetish"" describes it quite well. Rubber dresses, cross dressers, homosexuals in drag, Catholic school girls, whips, spanking. You couldn't ask for much more.This book is charged erotica in picture form. It's an explosion of colors and attitude in a way that will make even the most ardently celibate want to dabble.The only problem? There isn't nearly enough pictures. This book should've been about 300 pages."
3,Confused collection of passable photography,"Kloster offers a confusing array of atmospheres - grainy shots of lifestylers, Maybelline models wearing vinyl teddies and comically unconvincing sneers, one saddening shot of a little Russian prostitute posing leadenly in fetish heels, amateurish (and not charming) shots of preened and posturing club celebs. To call this ""a visual exploration of fetish"" is misleading. This is a jumbled mess of people wearing unusual clothing."
1,I couldn't get past the second track...,"...because it offered ridiculous ways to remember the terms like ""ohaiyoo gozaimsu"" like ""picture the state of Ohio with the sun coming up and it's going to a moss in the shape of an ""I."" Uh...no thanks. I'd rather just memorize this term by rote. Also, the pronunciation isn't quite right (it's ""ohaiyoo"" with an extended ""o"" sound at the end, rather than the shorter ""o"" at the end of ""Ohio."" There's a distinguishable difference between how the narrator speaks and how the other speaker pronounces the words; the latter sounds more like a native Japanese speaker.The story used to integrate the vocabulary was absurd and paced too quickly. It might have been enjoyable simply as a story, because it was a Douglas Adams kind absurd, I don't think it was helpful for language-learning."
5,Best language program out there!,"I have listened to many different language programs, and this one is by far the best. This one is actually fun to listen to and I've learned so much so quickly. Most informative and great value!"
5,FaithSkills is a Must Read!,Faith Skills is a must read for anyone struggling with their self identity...not only does it comfort the reader through it's short introductory stories that we are all traveling the same journeys....it also educates the reader how to make those journeys successful ones. Rene has catered this book in such a way that regardless of where you are starting to develop your self esteem...you will see growth and improvement in your life. - Rene has documented a master key that will open any door to my future...
4,Love it,"I bought an X41 tablet used and I love it. The screen is responsive and the tablet features are fun. Not having a cdrom drive is a bummer and it does get warm, but they are easily made up for by the ability to hand-write digital notes on a job site.Great Product."
1,Mine is a lemon,"Horrible, horrible, horrible machine. My problems with this machine could fill out a thick Grisham thriller. The fingerprint technology is not working. Certain USB devices are not recognized. The batteries went (almost) dead after 10 months. Wi-Fi is slow and weak: the laptops of my girlfriend or my co-author, put side-by-side, connect much faster and do not lose signals so frequently. Most recently it turned out that bluetooth is not working as well. I tried it with two different devices that, between themselves, established communication in ten seconds. The design of this machine is not so bad but there are various buttons that are either useless (Access IBM) or non-intuitively designed (page up/page down). Go for it if you want to take a risk of getting such a sour lemon as mine."
4,Consistency w/ Bon Shoulder Rest,"Nice piece of equipment that led to more consistency in my playing...After a few adjustments, the violin felt married to my shoulder...It's lite-weight, stable and comfortable...Highly recommend it !!"
2,Bon Musica Rest,"Disapointed. For my 4/4 Violin, it took some major re-engering to make it fit the violin and then the result was no better that I can get with a sponge. For me, it's an over rated piece of equipment."
5,"Excellent, Comfortable Shoulder Rest","I am a beginning adult violinist. I purchased this shoulder rest to find a comfortable fit for my violin, shoulder, and chin, after several attempts with standard shoulder rests. It is an amazing piece of equipment. It can be adjusted in numerous ways to achieve a customized fit. The extended, curved, left end can be bent to fit the violinist's shoulder and prevent the instrument from sliding off without requiring extensive down pressure from the chin. It is a little more expense than other standard shoulder rests, but it is definitely worth the price. I recommend this shoulder rest to any beginner who may be having trouble achieving a comfortable, relaxed bond with your violin."
4,"Very comfortable, but inconvenient","This is a very comfortable shoulder rest, and with it I find that it requires very little effort (none, really) to support the violin. The only downside is the shape and size, which makes it very difficult to find a violin case that will hold it. Of course, the size and shape is also what makes it comfortable, so it's hard to get too upset about that.I'm giving it a 5-star rating, though, since anyone who reads my review will know what to expect going in, regarding its awkwardness."
5,"Real improvement in posture, chin, shoulder, bowing...","I always had irritation and pain under my jaw from holding the violin. I tried many different chinrests. I modified my old reliable kun shoulder rest, but the violin still would slip down gradually as I played. The Bon Musica solved my problems. Violin does not slip at all. No more chin/jaw pain. I can move my head and chin a bit while playing, and the violin does not slip or dip. My left hand is more relaxed too, my vibrato has opened up, and shifting is easier. Also, my bowing is easier to keep straight, because my violin is always in same place, not constantly being readjusted as I play. I wish I had purchased a BonMusica shoulder rest along time ago, I didn't because of the price. The device is not perfect (c'mon you German engineers, you can do better!) but it's close enough for me."
1,My kid hated it.,"My kid wanted this shoulder rest, and he hated it. First. It doesn't fit into his 4/4 violin. Second. The height cannot be adjusted well. Third. The cushion is not comfortable. Don't buy it! Wasting money."
2,Foam peeled off after one month,"I had high expectations for this shoulder rest based on the reviews it received and at first I was very pleased. It was mechanically sturdy and very comfortable. However after only one month, both pieces of foam had completely peeled off the metal frame. I play and practice frequently and I did not expect the foam to last forever, but one month is completely unacceptable."
1,Do not Buy,"I bought this and 3-4 months later it would not go above the 1 setting! I emailed Amazon (that was the seller). They told me to email Derma Wand directly and, surprise!!, no response. I threw it away and bought something much better quality!"
2,Don't waste your money.,"I tried the Derma Wand after my Tuo Viso machine broke (after 5 years) & I did not have the money to replace it.The Derma Wand STINKS. It has a very low frequency on it & only 1 distribution point (Tuo Viso has 2) it takes 2 hours to do your whole face & the results do not last very long at all.The whole thing about guaranteed money back is bs too because I have the original packaging, receipt & so on & am being told it has been 65 days instead of the stated on receipt 60 days to return & I am stuck with it.I will continue to use it because I have it but I really don't think it is that great of a product."
4,Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it myself!,"I was rather skeptical about purchasing the wand, but, what the heck, it only cost $100, worth the try. After all, the surgeon's estimate to surgically correct the problem was over $4,000. Within 3 weeks of daily use, a very deep wrinkle under my eye improved about 75%. That wrinkle was the reason I purchased the wand, so I am a very happy lady. Other areas are improving also. This purchase is one of the best I have made in my life. I wouldn't believe it if I wouldn't be experiencing it myself."
3,Wand Not Durable,"The Derma Wand works. You will not see results instantly. I did notice small improvements after two weeks of daily use. The only problem is its not durable at all. Shortly after purchase, bulb broke, now the company wants $25 to replace. A bit pricey for such small results..."
3,Lasting effects,I like the product but the changes are not as drastic as they show in the advertisements nor are they long lasting but I still like it. it sure doesn't have any bad effects so far.
4,I'm glad I bought it,"I've been wanting to buy this product for years now, and did't because i was either pregnant, nursing, pregnant again nursing again and didn't really know if it was safe to use..... Finally i bought it for christmas, and have been using it twice a day for a month. The changes I've noticed for this past month has been in the texture and brightness of my skin. It is definetaly ""healthier looking"". I haven't noticed any major changes with wrinkles, but it is not magic, it has only been a month...I'll comment in a few more months and see if I'm getting younger!haha"
1,Too drying,I felt it only made my skin dry and therefore the wrinkles seemed even more noticable :( I think it might work well for someone with acne though.
4,Good product so far...,"I will come back to review further, so far I do see some results in my face after only a couple of weeks."
1,Not what they say,I guess if you believe this works it does but it did nothing for me what so ever. not worth bothering with.
4,reallyleery,"I think this wand does do some something for the skin, altho it does it slowly. Not too bad in all! Would recommend for a nice relaxed awake look."
1,Unethical Practices,"My wife ordered the Derma Wand, did nothing as claimed. She called and got authorization to return which she did. Derma Wand refused to acknowledge return even though the U.S. Post Office has confirmed delivery to Derma Wand and our credit card company has agreed we do not owe for the product. Derma Wand now threatening to turn the account over to a collection agency to make us pay even the product was returned in accordance with their procedures. Unless you want a fight on your hands and/or your credit rating damaged, do not do business with this company. Customer Service has not cooperated. We have filed complaints with their Customer Service, New York BBB, Corporate Headquarters and the Consumer Protection Division for the State of New York,"
2,Derma Wand,"I wasn't really pleased with this product. It does brighten up tired looking eyes. I wasn't happy about the smell it gives off while in usage, it kindda gave me a headache. I don't think it lives up to it standards and it surely does not compare to the professional treatment you receive in salons and dermatologist offices. I used it a few times and now it sits in my bathroom cabinet where it has been for months."
1,Broken product,"This product came broken without complete instructions. Now I get the joy of trying to get reimbursement, I plan to try again with QVC where you get a better warranty system."
3,43 year old Mom,"I've owned the Derma Wand for about 2 years now. I've found that slathering on any lotion (lots and lots) completely eliminates the ""sting"". I'd like to think that it's working great but can't tell too much. However, my skin has broken out my whole life and it is pretty rare for me to get bad breakouts anymore. I use it about twice a month. Now that I'm getting deeper wrinkles I'm going to try every other day and see what happens."
3,Great but I didn't receive the treatment,"I loved Derma Wand I've been using it for about a month and wow it really works. I didnt get the treatment thats why Im giving a 3 stars only, Im talking to the person in charge because I want the treatment I payed for."
3,Derma Wand Kit,"I just started using this product, so I can't say whether I like it or not or whether it's doing what it promises or not."
2,derma wand,"I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks,so it is really not fair for me to give it a star rating. I use it twice a day as directed. I'm not sure what kind of results I'm supposed to have in that time frame, so it is hard for me to say if it is working or not. I really can't see much difference, if any and no one has said anything about me looking any younger as seen in the ads. I'll keep using it and hope that I see some results in the near future."
1,Mine stop working at the second time,I do not live in the US and bought a derma wand and it stop working at the second time I was going to use it. It has poor quality. Please be careful if you want to buy one of these and you don't live in US
3,Not for me,Unfortunately I am sensitive to radio waves and it caused a slight dull headache after use so I was leary of continuing use although I did notice a tightening sensation.
4,I think it works!!,"I really didn't expect anything great from this product, but my mom bought it for Christmas for my sister and I. I can tell a it is doing something because I stopped using my Murad line eraser. I think it's worth a try. I can see more of a change than when I had it done at the spa once a month."
5,Nice,Been using this now for the past two months and can see a diiference. Will report later in about six months.
1,It quit working in less than 3 months,"Bought it mid September 2012, never got dropped / anything but suddenly quit working last week. Called their customer service, without asking question to diagnose what the problem it might be, she just said, it's the bulb and that is not covered under warranty. You have to ship the unit back to us & pay $25 for the bulb plus $9.99 for us to ship back the unit to you. NOT EVEN 3 MONTHS!!! And they said they have 10 years warranty, on WHAT? It could be the electrical item in the unit, who knows? But without even diagnosing they just said it's the part that isn't covered under warranty. What A Warranty. Totally disappointed,!"
1,Derma Wand,"I tried the product every day twice a day.... but I didn't see any results at all! It made my sikn very dry. Super service from seller...product arrived super fast...and the return was done very fast and professional, it was even picked up at my home, thank you for a super fast service!"
3,Dermawand,"It makes the skin feel better as in softer and maybe a little firmer, but has not reduced any wrinkles. Temporarily raises the eyebrow very little. I don't have bad wrinkles, but it needs to help a little more. I use it one to two times a day. I plan to keep using it to see if time will make a difference."
2,Very Scary Product,Derma Wand dryed out my skin on face even while using the moisturizers. Scary!!! Really would not reccomend wasting your money.
1,Great....while it lasted,"I really liked this device.......while it lasted, which wasn't very long. It creates a really nice, fresh smelling ozone smell, and I feel that it did help my skin. But I only got a chance to use it about 8 times before it broke."
1,Not good at all,"This product was awful! It burns and it made my wrinkles under my eyes and around my mouth worse. I followed the instructions to a ""T"" and this product has aged me about 10 years. I would never recommend this product."
1,Crap,"I believe most of the reviews I read on this product were paid for. This product does NOT work. I had read a couple of bad reviews and thought oh they just didn't use it long enough to see the results, Everyone wants instant results.....I used it every day for 2 months. I could see no difference. A waste of good money."
3,Derma Wand-The story continues....,"I have only been using the Derma Wand for about three weeks, so this may be a premature review. I have been faithfully using it twice a day, as the directions tell me but no results so far. None. Nothing.I have read that it takes time so I will keep the faith and keep using it. Would I buy it again? Probably not at this point."
1,Complete BULL,Went through all of this for friggin 60 days.....absolutely nothing !!! most these great reviews must be shills/fakes...
2,Probably not for someone who already has deep wrinkles,"I have been using it for 3 weeks and honestly, I believe it has made my skin look more wrinkled than less. I am afraid to even keep using it at this point."
3,Not comfortable with it.,"The item worked like it was suppose to, but I didn't the zapping feeling and I only had it on setting 3. Also it seemed to aggravate a scar I have on my face and I don't want to do that. I would like to return it."
3,It's ok I guess...,"I do not own this product but when I used to frequent the spa(before I began doing my own facials and peels) my aethetician would use this on my face to kill the bacteria post extractions.It's not as though I ever paid extra for this but to be honest, I don't know how effective it really is... I never had break-outs afterwards. But....then again--I have never had break-outs after a facial/peel treatment prior to using the wand.>>shrugs<<I trust the folks at my spa and I know that they know what they're doing and for that I'll give the wand 3.5 stars---but I guess I just don't see the big deal."
1,What is this?,"OK, I'm deployed so I don't know what's new for Slipknot out there, is this a new Concert DVD, new songs? Someone help...."
1,"Product is OK, be careful about rebate offer.","I bought this printer and it's working OK. The $200 rebate ISN'T. The rebate apppears to be a scam although quite official looking. It's administered by Parago Inc. who return my e-mails with a ""we're looking into it"" letter. First they denied my rebate saying I had already had receive a check. When I called their Customer service, they said they had no information about sending me a check but my rebate had been denied... And that they would look into it. Long story short, I'm on my 3rd Black Toner cartrige and still no rebate. I've sent the complaint to the Attorney Generals office in hopes they can help.The printer is OK for light home office use, but not for photographs (matte ink) It is also loud when it runs and much slower than advertised."
3,Do Not Buy If In 2012,Konica Minolta does not suppport there printers drivers when new operating systems come out. Why. It would take a tech guy a few hours or less to create a new driver. I have a perfectly low usage Magicolor 2300w and Windows 7 64 bits and Konica will not support Windows 7. I have heard this directly from them. Search the web and see how many people have this printer and others from this company with no current driver. I had to upgrade my Windows 7 to pro version so I could have access to Windows virtual XP just to operate this printer. Still having issues. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER KONICA MINOLTA Product. This makes my perfectly working 2300w a paper weight.Unfortunately this is a great printer that serves no use in 2012 unless your running XP or below.
1,Feeling ripped off,"If you find this printer for a good price, make sure that you buy several of them since they are cheaper than replacing the toner cartridges and drum, even taking into account the crippled ""low capacity"" cartridges shipped with the printer. As the other reviewers have said, once the printer decides that you are out of toner it stops printing completely. My printer decided today that there was 0% left of all three color cartridges (what are the odds of that?) so it stopped printing and won't even print black and white pages. Also beware that the low capacity toner cartridges have the same part number as the high capacity ones. Make sure you know what you are ordering."
1,The Pinto of Printers,"What's the difference between a Pinto and a Minolta QMS 2300 DL? The Pinto will last ten times longer than the Minolta. If you buy this printer, you need to hope that it breaks down before the warranty is up or you will be stuck with a pice of junk. Mine was perfect for one year but is on it's last legs after a year and a half. Minolta refuses to fix a known issue with the paper feed because it is out of warranty. Unfortunately the known issue didn't start until the warranty expired. If I print once it has gone into sleep mode, the first page starts 1"" or so too far down the page. Then for every page after that, I have to take the paper out of the tray, turn it over and put it back in before the printer recognizes that there is paper in the tray. Print quality has taken a nose dive as well. I am still on my second toner cartridge for cyan and my third for magenta, yellow and black. Judge for yourself. If you want a printer to last longer than this, buy something else."
4,Some assembly required,"The book is nice visually, as a gallery of handcrafted wooden marvels, many hundreds of years old, and has a wealth of interesting facts and photos, but, because it is so fragmented, is not a history that can be easily read straight through. For a briefer history, but with descriptions and samples of modern makers, and with maintenance and buying advice, get The Piano by Jean-Paul Williams. Just as nice visually."
2,Low Image Quality,"The quality of the glossy print paper is good, but the print itself looks like it was a originally a small image, enlarged to fit the paper. It's pixelated, and probably not worth the purchase."
4,The transfer is imperfect but the singing isn't,"This recording demonstrates the exceptional singing ability of ""Mr. C.""It is unfortunate that the recordings for which he is best known, while great commercial successes, do nothing to share with the listener his great musicianship....impeccable intonation and phrasing....much admired by none other than Billie Holliday.His effortless transition between vocal registers is characteristic of a voice that few performers of his time equalled.If there is any criticism I would have of Perry Como, it is that he compromised a great artistic talent for commercial success."
5,Thule Adapter Kit,"I bought this adapter kit to go with my thule load bars. I installed these on my existing factory rack on my 2004 GMC Envoy. I did have to make some minor adjustments for a proper fit,but it works very nicely on my factory rack and is very secure. The adapters are a little pricey, but very well made."
5,A very instructive & educatinal video for back ain sufferers,I've had back pain for years and I've received multiple instructions from physical therapists to exercise my back. Never had it been so easy and simple. It was a very instructive and very helpful video.
2,It's paper and a plastic tray,"Totally my fault for not reading the description well enough, but this is just paper and a plastic tray. For some reason I thought there was paint included too. Well the reason is the price! Although the price on this specific item is the same as specialty toy stores (local I found it for $15 plus tax), this is just an awful value. It's just paper and a plastic tray!"
4,house that is more personable and warm,"My reviewer Kris had this to say... ""Ferrer spins house that is more personable and warm than some and while it does suffer from the repetitiveness that is very nearly part and parcel of the house genre, it's got more entertainment longevity and hook than a lot of this stuff I've heard. You can kick back and chill (or get up and dance) to ""The World as I Know It"" and feel the groove for a bit, though it does tend to start fading into the background partway through the disc. The opening tracks are quite strong - especially ""Church Lady,"" an album highlight that features compelling gospel elements - and they help to draw you in. That way, you're less likely to bail later when proceedings begin to wear a little thin. But please note - I said ""a little."" Ferrer has done a good job with his subtley Afro-infused house textures and the genre's fans should be especially pleased."" [...]"
1,Battery,"Battery lasted maybe a week, wasn't new: package looked new, but scamed!!Try to stay away from 3 party vendors...."
1,"No One's Fault, I Think","This battery made my R40 Thinkpad crash repeatedly after installation. The company was very responsive and issued a full credit. I have not bought any replacement battery since, not even from Lenovo, and use AC power only. I'm waiting until this battery issue is worked out."
3,Looks Great,"I really wanted to like this shoe for the look and heel height were just what I wanted, but just was not comfortable. It was too tight for me across the instep and overall just not the usual comfort of ECCO. The return was swift and easy. Would try the company again."
2,Great durability but...too narrow!,"I have had this shoe for a year now. Like it very much for the quality of craftmanship and leather... but it is not comfortable to wear.Not like the usual Ecco comfort.Your foot really starts feeling squeezed from sides after about an hour of wearing, not immediately. And this sensation progresses into the time.Very wierd and uncomfortable feeling.I can't say I have a very wide foot, and besides, I don't feel my foot is squeezed until about 40-45 mins of wearing.Something must have gone wrong with this particular model.But, I guess, for a person with a very narrow foot, it's gonna make a nice shoe!Not for me, though..."
1,Worst Shoes I've Ever Purchased...,"I've been attempting to wear these shoes for 11 months now to no avail. They are much, much narrower than advertised and start feeling uncomfortable after approximately one hour of wear. I have even tried taking them to a shoe store to have them stretched, unsuccessfully. I have written to Ecco for advice regarding this unwearable shoe to which I was basically told ""too bad"". I cannot believe I spent $100 dollars for shoes that I cannot wear. I will never buy shoes from Ecco again. Worst. Shoe. (And company.) Ever. If there was a ranking of less than one star, this poorly made shoe would definitely qualify."
4,Como at his best,"Two albums on one disc. So Smooth has some good small group tracks. The winner is We Get Lettera. Como in a small group jazz setting.with Boomie Richman, Mel Davis and Tony mottola adding great support. Wrll worth the pric, and thew usual great service."
3,OK for awhile,"I purchased this item when I knew less ASL than now, and quickly outgrew it. As others have stated there is alot of information on deaf culture and little notes on social situations that were helpful. The photos were acceptable, even good. The book is not a dictionary, but rather designed to give you a kick start into conversation on a basic level. The DVD is user friendly and helps train your eyes to view signing, but contrary to some others I'd read about being too fast, this is too slow. There is a place for it though and would not consider it to be a waste, just expect to get what you do from it and then move on."
2,"""Look Ma, no hands!""","The idiots guide, with black and white pictures, of people with bad 1980's hair, had to be returned. First of all, when learning to sign, one can't help to feel like and idiot and doesn't need a title to remind them. The pictures were not defined, grainy and out of date, and nowhere did they show the sign for, the ""hair club!?"". If your attention is always going to be on the woman's ""hug,"" hairdo, and not her hands, then there is a problem. Sign is difficult and perhaps actual flash cards are the way to go - maybe learn one a day? I would not get this book, sorry Flock of Seagulls."
4,Good starter book,My husband is using this book to begin learning sign language and it is working very well for him as he can converse quickly.
2,disappointing...,"this book is nothing like i thought it would be. i was looking for something that would give me more on conversation style than actual vocabulary words/signs. i got more out of a dictionary than this. it was a complete waste of money, for me. the pictures are decent. they lack variation & real life feel (well, maybe that is the disappointment of the overall book). i do not recommend this book for someone trying to learn another language and not just the subtle niceties."
3,So far so good,"I'm about halfway through DM-ing this game for some graduate students who've mostly never played before, and we're having a grand time. However, this middle section isn't as rich as the first third in detail and tangential intrigue, but the framework remains good. I've supplemented the campaign with side adventures (remember White Plume Mountain? They've done that, and in a few more levels they'll be invited to search the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth) and am working to introduce appropriate NPC's. Still, it's a grand campaign which helps the side adventures become part of a larger plotline."
1,"Good beginning, no sting in its tail...","This boxed set is split into three books, of which the first one is the best. The second is the worst, and the third is slightly better than the second. The final encounter in this adventure is a cheap cop-out of which very little is gained. Appropriate for levels 1+ (to about 15th level, maybe 20 if you're a good party)."
5,Suzette's Review,What a beautiful book covering San Francisco California and done with Photograph's. Teh Photographer captures the joy and struggle along with the struggle of picking yourself up and starting all over after the most desvating earth quake the city had even seen.
1,Warning! This frame doesn't fit California license plates!,"I bought two of these frames for my new vehicle in October. Once I received my California plates, I found that they did not fit inside either license plate frame - not by much, but enough so that the frames would not mount flush with the license plates - they were about a half centimeter too small. I think this is a manufacturing defect with the frames rather than the plates, as I tried another set of California plates and they did not fit as well. Bummer for me was that I purchased the frames prior to receiving the plates, and once I received them and discovered they didn't fit, it was outside of Amazon's 30-day return window. So be careful buying this item."
4,BATMAN/1966,"great stuff, funny, but good. hope they'll be making another CD. more music missing from the TV series."
3,Stopped MOST Birds,"I glued these strips to the top of a horizontal section of downspout using silicone caulk. Most birds seemed to be deterred by the spikes, but one persistent robin built a nest between the spikes. I removed the nest prior to any eggs, and it didn't return."
4,good tage,These are good tage that we tried to restrain two Guineas that adopted us from roosting on our air conditioner. They worked
5,Watch This DVD Before Going to Berlin and Munich!,"This is one of our favorite Rudy Maxa travel videos. We showed it to our daughters before departing, and then followed several of his recommendations. If you weren't planning to go to Germany, this video might change your mind. (Our big surprise was Berlin, which is one of the hottest cities in Europe right now for the arts and entertainment, fueled to a significant degree by the booming German economy.)"
4,Polish Pottery,"Very nice piece of pottery, got it for my wife for her birthday. It came quickly, was packaged appropriately, and she loves it."
4,Excellent product.,I really like the fit of this ballet slipper on my daughter. Its comfortable and durable.
5,A sweet story,My children and I love this book.I read it outloud to my 5 and 7 year olds.Just a nice simple story of a boy and his favorite stuffed toy
4,Madly Erotic,I found this adult graphic novel on the sexual rampage of the main charecter Coley to be purley sexual. The story plot is vague and blotchy but the graphic content is fantastic. Definatly for adults only. If your looking for content and storyline this isnt what you want but if you want nothing but the sexual artwork than its a must.
3,Sorry but I didn't like the artwork,"Very high score for the raunchiness, but low score for the drawing which is rather childish and the 'hero' quite ugly though he's supposed to be an irresistible sex god. He looked more like a she, ugh. Sorry if the artist is offended but I like my dude to be more Ben than Jenn."
5,Great Band,These guys played my fraternity back in 1995 and they were awesome. I picked up the CD at the show. Saw them live in Delaware a couple of other times. Great alternative band--some really melodic but hard-edged songs on the disc. I really thought these guys were going to break big but it never happened. One of my favorite CD's still to this day.
1,Can I get my money back?,"After all the good reviews, I expected great things from this album, which made my disappointment all the worse. Sorry, but this is a complete failure in every way. The arrangements are static or plodding, and the use of traditional percussion (handclaps, for cryin' out loud!) only heightens the feeling that you're listening to a high school band that can keep a tune. I know they thought they were bridging the old and the new, but they've only succeeded in dragging down the exciting into the mundane. Even as a goof, it's just no fun. For the real thing, I strongly urge everyone to check out Empire Brass' PASSAGES, which, while a bit different, successfully achieves the artistic aims this album so completely fails to."
3,If day walks are your thing . . .,"I am currently planning my walking holiday in France, so I am trying to learn as much as I can before I arrive. I found this book to be helpful in as far as it dealt with practical matters of conditions in France; such as visas, telephones and doctors. It also gave a good indication of the attractions that walkers will find in France on a regional basis.I felt, however, that for a country famous for its very long distance trails, this book had an unhappy focus on short, often single day, walks. To be fair, it dealt in detail with the gruelling ""GR20"" trail in Corsica, but that was the only real endurance walk that it looked at. Given that these walks are my focus, I found this book to be something of a disappointment.That being said, someone looking to enliven his holiday with one or more short, possibly overnight, walks could do a lot worse than this handy little book."
5,"Women LOVE these guys, & I should know. ^_~","Ever since I was a little girl I've been fascinated with the 3 Stooges. & they're NOT women haters, their script writers were shovanists. They deserved SO much more respect & love than what they got back in their days. I LOVED that remake biography ABC made^_^"
4,Fun read,"OK, maybe it isn't great literature, or even literature at all, but fo Stooges lovers it is a really fun read. A ton of pictures. Moe Howard tells how it all happenned. He explains who the various Stooges were, where they came from , and what happenned to them. Shemp died peacefully in a friend's car after a horese race. He just leaned against a friends shoulder and died with a smile on his face. I can't believe that it has been over 25 years since Moe, the last of the original Stooges died.Great book, and a great way to relive some of your childhood."
4,Received Incorrect Parts,"Initially ordered 2. Received promptly, however, some of the parts were incorrect in both and could not install. Contacted Grohe and they replaced with correct ones promptly. Now working well."
4,GOOD MOVIE,"THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE BUT I HAD TO SEND THE FIRST DVD IN FOR A REFUND BECAUSE THE DVD WAS STRATCHED, THEN I BOUGHT ANOTHER DVD FROM THOSE PROCEEDS."
5,"Great value, great sound, great EVERYTHING","This player is absolutly the best. It has more features than I need. My player is asimilar model. Mine does not have a remote or FM tuner. I love everything about it. The only bad part is the fact it does not have Bass boost, but the sound quality makes up for that. The other bad thing is that there are many parts that are there for onamentation that seem to be a little loose on mine, but I think that they will hold. The warranty of one year is better than most 90 Day warrantees so itf something does fall off, which will most likely happen before the warranty is gone. The head phones that come with it are bad so I reccomend the Sony MDR-G52 for headphones. Battery life is 8 hours, but your's will be shorter because it has a remote. Samsung makes the best sounding MP3 players. I reccomend this one highly to anyone. It is the best one around."
5,Great Player,"This is a great player that is so easy to use. The only thing I don't like about it is it uses up batteries fast ,but this player's battery use is a lot less than other players out on the market. I found that if you use the remote the batteries used up really fast. The software is easy to install and really easy to use. I have seen lots of mp3 players and this is one of the easiest to use. A feature that I like about it is the voice recorder. Once you record something you can put it onto you computer and send it in an e-mail or what not. I like my player and use it often. I would recomand this player to everyone."
2,Gigantic hair brush - only for people with long hair,"I bought this brush without realizing that the brush had a 3 inch diameter. Needless to say, unless you have lots of hair this brush is impossible to use. I have short hair so the brush is useless to me. However, the brush is well made. It was my mistake by not reading the description carefully -- I would by similar brush if smaller one is available."
2,Good Perhaps For A Baby,"Although the handle is very comfortable and has a great feel and grip, the bristles are way too soft for my hair which is very fine, long, wavy, and easily tangled. It actually brushes over the top layer of the hair, never penetrating because the bristles totally collapse.If I had an infant, the bristles used in those brushes are comparable to the type used in this brush. There is no firmness whatsoever. I can't even imagine a boar with fur as soft as those on this so-called boar-bristle brush.If it hadn't been a hygenic type of product, I'd have sent it back; instead, I had to discard it."
2,Okay for limited applications,"At first glance, the DL0129 hot shoe slave appears to be a steal: inexpensive, wireless remote hot shoe slave. Unfortunately, I've found that the flash pickup sensor does not always work, and when it does, it's not able to fire the flash quickly enough to make a difference in the photo. (The delays appear to be as slow as 1/5 to 1/15 of a second.)If you're doing some very specific long-exposure shots that require a fill flash (ie., to ""freeze"" some action), this might work. Otherwise, pay a little more and get a hot shoe slave that works for a majority of situations."
3,"This is a good book, but its problem is not racism","This is a good book, but its problem is not racism, it is naivety.The typical western thinking is like ""a straight intestine goes directly to the bottom"". That is, the relationship between the historical evolutions from dictatorship to democracy is always misconstrued as a linear process, democratization is deemed a historically inevitable process, which can not be stopped, regardless of current realities, in cases of countries that have adopted certain Western institutions and socioeconomic approaches.These journalists can add a lot of stories to our knowledge, but they usually can't think; and when they think, they can't get out of the ""prison of one culture""."
2,He lost me in Chapter 1,The credibility of this author was completely shot with me when he described russia under vladimir Putin as a responsible and stable democracy in the first chapter of the book.
1,Author lack of scientific knowlage or IQ?,">Even more strikingly, Dr. Williamson's group reported that a version of a gene called DAB1 had become universal in Chinese but not in other populations.>>>>>When this author claimed Chinese identidity as fiction, he is obviously ignorant of true science. There are more genetic markers unigue for Chinese han.This author also believes individual representing national character? His mind is as simple as savage people. The most obedient people make the best army and strong nation. The countries made of individiual rambos are the wimpy ones like those middle east. Most obedient Japanese in Asia and English in Europe are the strongest nation. Kamikaze is act of obedience and loyalty, not matter of personal bravery.Author is simply not very sophisticated."
2,5-star subjective,"The book might be attractive, but it can be totally subjective as well. The author expressed his attitude, but if one is interested in truth, think twice and do by yourself.A fact is: China never committed massacre in its long history, in contrast to Japanese.Descendants of the arsonists in China's Winter Palace in 1860 become the most civilized peoples. Occupiers of the land of American indians becomes evangelists of democracy.Reading a book is easy, but for truth be serious."
1,"totally biased , not worth reading at all",at least I admire this author's courage to write such a book without knowing that much about China and its people.
1,Bullshit---This book is for know-nothing,"The airhead author confused too much things, and he did not know the real Chinese history and international entente. Taiwan, a part of China,was attacked by Janpanese, and then returned to China after WWII---the author could not be so stupid and unknew the ""Cairo proclamation""."
5,Great Live Album!,Live At The Star Club really captures Jerry Lee Lewis in his prime. The sound quality is great compared to some of the other live performances that are available. Recommended for any fan of rock and roll.
4,Wonderful Performance/Poor recording,Oh how I would have loved to have been there to hear this wildly energetic and Jerry Lee defining performance. It is so unfortunate that the live recording is fairly muddy in spots and generally not up to current standards. Still worth the purchase.
5,It's true,"This is absolutely, positively the best Jerry Lee Lewis record. Period. No question. It freakin SMOKES!"
4,Too detailed? That's where the devil is...,"While this book may not appeal to students in search of the CliffNotes version of the political process, this exhaustive account of the1986 tax reform bill gets a complicated story just about right. Especially when it concerns the tax code, the devil is in the details, and while B&M sometimes go a little overboard in describing the small print of oil depletion allowances and the like, the fact is that Congressmen think that way -- and voters had better know it. All in all, a solid addition to the 'how a bill becomes a law' ouevre. Plus, it makes you like an odd array of people: Ronald Reagan, Bill Bradley, and even Bob Packwood. Where are they now?... END"
1,Boring,Could have been condensed into a much shorter book. Filled with trivial details... it was boring.
1,Not pleased!!,This is not a good clipper. I bought it because it was cheaper but it takes 4 or 5 pushes at least to clip the needle off. I was really disappointed. I will definitely go back to the BD clipper which works EVERY TIME.
5,Needle Clipper,Received much faster than I expected. The only needle clipper I use because it is so easy and convenient and I don't have to wrry about disposal.
1,Does Not Work,"This product is junk; it simply will not sever a 22 gauge syringe needle, which is only average sized. The seller's product description should make clear how limited this product is."
1,Do not work for Penmates,"My son has the Penmate system for this novolog pens and you cannot clip the needles wit this clipper. The penmate system simplifies giving shots for children. They don't see a needle and just push a button to get the shot. We have to use the BD Clipper, as this clipper just won't reach the needle."
5,Harf is King,"This is a great look at one of the best wakeboarders out there, that of course is Danny Harf. It has information on lots of other wakeboarders too, and talks about where wakeboarding came from. I use this book and some of the other extreme books for a kids camp I work at that helps kids check out sports before they try them. They seem best for the junior high kids who don't know much about the sport but maybe have heard of some of the people in the books. This book will not teach you how to wakeboard, but might help someone get interested in the sport. There is a trick list which is pretty funny with things like hoochie glide defined and it's cool for lots of pics and reading suggestions."
4,Shop Fox 8 oz. Brass Head Mallet,This product arrived on time and upon initial inspection seems to be of good quality. The brass head screws on and fits securely enough to perform without rattling loose.
2,Works OK after some prep,"The picture looks better than the real product. I wasn't impressed with the finish on the handle, but hey, it was $11. A little sandpaper helped.I agree with another reviewer about the cheap stenciling of the SHOP FOX. I too sanded that garbage off.I wasn't able to use it for more than few swings on the chisel before the head started coming loose. Regardless of how much I tightened it, the thing continued to come lose. Tightening it too much started to draw the wood screw that holds the head on out of the handle. I finally glued the screw into the handle, and the head onto the screw with some Titebond II and let it sit overnight. It's worked fine since then.I was a little leery about buying shop fox tools given their general poor ratings I've come across. This tool more-or-less confirms I will never buy another shop fox tool again. Good thing I tested out shop fox with an inexpensive tool."
2,Driving circuit died 1year+2weeks,"I had this lamp for just over a year. Great design and worked great. Not that much light coming out, but was perfect by my PC to light up the work space.Just over the warranty period my lamp stopped working - it would turn on for a few seconds and then flicker off. I'm sure LEDs are fine and the problem is in the driver circuit. I was hoping to have this lamp for a long long time, as LEDs are very reliable. Unfortunately there are other parts and looks like the quality of them is not up to par.Update: Received and e-mail from Koncept in ~20 minutes after submission of my complain through their website. I was promised an updated circuit design at no charge (waiting for a prepaid FedEx shipping label). Very impressed by the promptness of Koncept customer service. Would upgrade my rating to 4 stars, but that choice is not availablePaying over $100 for something that would break in just over a year is not very comforting. I'm yet to hear from Koncept on my options."
3,A good game but.....,"Now I must say the gameplay on this game is great. I've played Grandia Extreme and Grandia 3 so I knew what to expect of sorts on how the gameplay for this was allready going to be. The storyline on this game is amazing. So you're probably asking yourself why I only gave this a 3 star review after what I previously mentioned. There is no difficulty to this game. I'm over 20 hours into the game now and not once have any of the boss battles ever been a problem. I've only had 2 of my characters die at any given time throughout the game thus far. This game is definitely a great game for beginners, but those who are looking for more of a challenge, you will not find it here."
5,The best Game of Grandia,Forget about all the others that came after this one. They aren't anywhere near as great as this one is! This the first one and ORIGINAL! The Best one of them all! If you have the opportunity to get this game here than go for it.
3,"Good For Beginners, Ideal in fact","Being an old Sega Saturn owner I used to dream of being able to playing this game in English, now thanks to Uncle Sony I can. I really wanted this game to be the best RPG I'd ever played, along the lines of Phantasy Star IV, Panzor Dragoon Azel or Final Fantasy. But whilst this game is good, it just cannot compete with those games.Grandia is far too easy, most people sight the fact that the battles are half the fun in this game, believe me they aren't! They become tedious as even the bosses don't pose much of a challenge. I even beat the final boss without a scratch!Plus points are that the story is nice, if a little perdictable, but it really picks up the pace on the second disc. If you're new to RPG's than I can think of no better introduction to the genre, the young may find this fun also."
3,Dosage too low,"Title says it all, dosage is too low to be doing anything.80mg/tablet vs others at 500mg/capsule.If you multiply the price by 500/80 you get the same price as all the others.Save your trouble and time and buy the 500mg"
5,Nice,HR-8061-2 nice tach/hour meter. easy instructions. Nice and small. plenty of signal wire. As for other reviews stating its hard to read. So is my LCD casio watch in certain conditions. Definately recommend it.
4,Solid Meter,Does what it is supposed to do and appears to be more accurate than the cheaper knock-offs. The button that switches it from hours to RPMs is a little hard to push which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
4,SIMPLE TO SET UP,"I also bought this for my generator to make sure its running at 3600 rpm's..It seems well put to together and easy to install..The increments read in 20 rpms spreads on my generator, ie.. 3580-3600 rpm., 3600-3620 rpms....so you have to use your judgement some where in between,, but it does the job..Would like an on/off switch to conserve the battery, or an auto shut off, since the battery is sealed inside...planned obsolescence????"
2,Cute but broke after a few weeks,"This is a cute ring however if you don't keep it on your toe and have to continually adjust it, the metal will give and it's broken. This would be more worth it out of a cracker jack box."
2,VERY CUTE,"EDITIt broke after a week of wearing!This a very cute toe ring! only thing is that of course because it is filigree its going to be brittle so be careful! I would not take this one on and off allot, but it does dig into your toe if you are wearing socks and boots. It left a bloody ring round my toe where it dug in. I have been wearing toe rings my whole life so I'm used to that feeling but if this is your first time I would recommended one that is flat all around.As for he look, well its allot prettier in person! very cute and flattering! I thought it was going to be bigger because of the picture put its really the perfect size! I'm very happy with this purchase!"
3,"Good, but I wish it could last longer","Well I bought this toe ring awhile ago and this was my first toe ring btwThe toe ring was nevertheless cute and much better than the picture (because it much shiner than it is in picture)the quality of the metal itself was okay I guess. It fit perfectly in my toe, but you see I have a problem with the ring.It tarnishing (turning slightly yellowish kind of thing) because I'm using it while I'm taking a bath and such..but then again 'do I have to take it off every single time I take a bath/shower in the first place?'Well anyways, I did take it off afterwards every time I'm going to take a shower.So probably that's why it got broke because I took it off and put it back on so many times.Overall I think the product was good, because it last on me for like 2 or 3 months before it snapped/broke."
5,Beautiful,"This is a very beautiful Toe-ring, nicely crafted, I love it! If one has pretty big toes it might not fit quite es nicely but it does with me, just right!"
3,Not worthy of the HP name,"This scanner has many good points, but doesn't live up to the HP name. It warms up slowly, scans slowly, and the manual slide mechanism on the 6390 version is a pain. I bought it to support a busy customer reception area, and it just isn't up to the job. Being a relatively expensive scanner, and an HP, I expected more.The SCSI interface is VERY nice, and using it reduces the time per scan considerably."
4,Excellent quality scans and easy to use,"If you're looking for a fast, easy-to-use, flatbed scanner -- look no further. It produces high-quality scans with ease of use. The buttons on the front allow you to easily make copies (just press the Print button!), or fax it, or e-mail it, etc. Very easy to use and set-up. I'm very happy with the results. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the Slide Adapter doesn't produce very good results from 35mm slides. They are ""ok"", but not great. But as for the flatbed scanner, it's fantastic!"
1,A total nightmare,"This has to be one of the worst products that HP has produced. I bought this in tandem with the Photosmart 1315. BIG MISTAKE! Not only are both products off the market, but HP offers no assistance what-so-ever. If you pay them $... they will assist you. What a rip-off! I'll never purchase a HP product again."
2,unstable,"Here are various comments I have about this scanner, which I've owned for over two years.- not-too-bad results for color photos, especially for web use.- the film/slide-adapter contraption that it comes with is practically useless. The reflector inside is hazy, and since it is made of cheap plastic, it broke when I tried to use it. The lighting on the resulting images is waay off and the over all quality is pretty bad.- ScanJet software that it comes with isn't too friendly, but it's ok after you get used to it.- scanning anything over 300dpi is much slower than expected- this machine is LOUD!Well just last night, the scanner literally burnt up and died on me when I connected it to another computer. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but when I ran a test scan, the light burnt out and the slider choked as it tried to scan..leaving a pretty nasty burnt odor in the room for a while..."
1,it is aweful.,I have had one for a long time. The mac OS X drivers are terrible and glitch up your system. It is possible to get them to work if you monkey with them for a while but not worth it. Seems to be a good piece of hardware but the software sucks so bad it cannot be redeemed.
3,Gate of Flesh (1964) - Seijun Suzuki,"Gate of Flesh is a film that Seijun Suzuki was told to make under his studio contract. In the hands of a normal filmmaker the film would be unforgettable at best, but under the direction of Suzuki, Gate of Flesh becomes a surreal journey in the lives of prostitutes, and post war Japanese citizens. As usual with any Suzuki film, the acting is stilted, the stories are weak, and the dialogue is predictable, but Suzuki always brings such visual flair to his films that they become something more than they really deserve to be. The sets are nice and the colors are bold, and the cinematography brings a rather interesting element to an unintersting script. Gate of Flesh is really a B-film given a stylistic treatment courtesy of Seijun Suzuki."
3,a shocking film about a Japanese brothel,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Gate of Flesh or Nikutai no mon, is the story of a brothel in postwar US occupied Japan. A local man hides from the police in the brothel and as the days go by, one of the prostitutes falls in love with him. The film is nototious for its graphic depiction of corporal punishment by the madame of her workers and I recommend viewer discretion.The DVD has some special featrures including an interview with director Seijun Suzuki and production designer Takeo Kimura, a theatrical trailer and a slide show production photos."
3,Irmin Schmidt - 'Impossible Holidays / Musk At Dusk' (Mute),"Not my thing, but overall, this experimental CD {maybe too much for some} is okay - not bad but again not as good as some of his other titles like 'Kamasutra' or 'Filmmusik Anthology, Vol. 4-5'. Tracks here that are so-so include ""Surprise"", ""Shudder Of Love"", ""Time The Dreamkiller"" and the smooth-sounding ""Great Escape"". Check out the line-up: Irmin Schimdt - synthesizer, keyboards & vocals, fellow Can alumni Jaki Liebezeit - drums, Frank Ema - bass, Gitte Haenning - vocals, Max Lasser - slide guitar, Egon Stegemoller - violin and Manfred - flugehorn."
1,Not the filter canister advertised.,"The filter advertised is a Shalon Chemical Type M-80 gas mask filter with 40mm Standard NATO thread. The filter canister I received is a Russian made filter canister, labeled in Cyrillic ""GP-6."" It also appears to have been made in 1978; far beyond it's expiration date. It does however, fit NATO canister thread specifications, so it will fit Israeli M-15 and Civilian gas masks. However, it's protective capabilities should be brought into question."
1,Filter Sold By Outdoor Bunker,The filters are dated 1986 and look and smell like they've been in a rodent infested basement for that long. Yuck! Don't buy from this place!
3,Gas canister,"Could use some better instructions on its use but thats all I know at this moment. As far as function, I haven't used one yet so I have no idea if it works or doesn't work. I cna only hope, if the occasion arises, it wil functionm."
2,No date at all on it. That seems shady.,"Another commenter here said that they bought this from Fox Racing and the expiration date was 2005. I bought this same item from this same seller just now, and there's no date on it at all.When these are made, they have a date on them. Many online merchants remove the date - or to be fair, it may well be the merchant's supplier that removed the date. I've seen several merchants explain that they get these from so many sources that it's impossible for them to make any claims about any dates at all. Fair enough. However, if just one frickin merchant would stick to making such claims, and would sell filters that aren't expired, they would get ALL the business. (And then immediately run out of stock probably :)I'm knocking off two stars because I have to assume it's expired and thus no longer NBC protection. I'm knocking off an additional star because someone removed the date altogether."
3,this is not the supplier i got if from,"amazon is not good with matching your purchases with the correct supplier. I got 2 of these and am still trying to figure out if they can be used in real deal situations. There is nothing but some type of russian or some other language on them. be careful as these may not be real good filters, they do seem new, but the protection level is not identified.The filter is selected according to the toxic compound.[2] Each filter type protects against a particular hazard:AX - Low-boiling (≤65 C) organic compoundsA - High-boiling (>65 C) organic compoundsB - Inorganic gases (hydrogen sulfide, chlorine, hydrogen cyanide)E - Sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride (acidic gases)K - Ammonia and aminesCO - Carbon monoxideHg - MercuryReactor - Iodine and methyl iodide (radioactive)P - Particles; classified as P1, P2, and P3 according to removal efficiencyABEK, ABEK-P3, ABEK-HgP3 or other combination filters against multiple hazards"
2,Item not as pictured,Item not as pictured. Item arrived sealed in plastic bags and boxed. Filter not the same color as pictured and did not have any labeling.
3,"Works ok for farts, but not for Zombie Virus.","The price was good so I thought what the heck? My roomate was complaining about my flatulence until I bought him this. Unfortunately, he depended upon it during the Great Sheboygan Zombie Wars of 09, and it let the virus through. Had to run him down with a forlift carrying two tons of cheese. Good times, good times."
5,worked perfect,"I don't know why, but you can't buy these kind of tools in Canada! So I ordered 3 of these from Amazon to reattach a bridge on an old Harmony 12 string. They worked perfectly. Lightweight, and strong, I didn't have to block or support them underneath to keep the top from bending. I did have to stick 1/2"" blocks to the bottom surfaces to clear a brace, and I did have to use thin pieces of wood shims under the clamping screw so as to not mar the bridge. I make no claims at all of being even close to a luthier, not even in my dreams. I'm just a picker and grinner who enjoys getting my hands on old beat up guitars and helping them make music again. Very happy with these clamps. And the shipping was relatively fair and very fast. The shipping only took 5 days! (For US shipping to Canada, that's Very Fast!)Derrick"
4,Did the job!,"I had to glue down a bridge that was starting to raise on a 12 string guitar. Stewart-McDonald carries these job specific tools and they are high quality with a high price tag. Not being a luthier, and this being a one-time project (hopefully), the 2 clamps I purchased did the trick just fine and was half the cost!"
4,I love my Goddess in a Box!,"This packet comes with a small goddess statue that acts as an incense burner, 4 sticks of incense, and a very thick, small book of goddess affirmations - heavy on the Native American and more obscure goddesses. The box also turns into an altar. I have always been a big fan on Nancy Blair and really like this concept.My only bias is that because it is a 365 day book of goddess, I wish all the major goddesses were representated. I agree that mentioning obscure goddess is important, but I think representing the core group is also valid. I would recommend this set to anyone."
4,good game its just short,If you've played action adventure games before you'll blow through this in a few hours. Its fun and senseless but can get old quickly they do add mini games to break up the shooting but their only a few. Still a good game though and its fairly cheap. Good game if you want to reminisce how games were back in 2002.
4,Good game- with a few problems,"I recently got this game for christmas and I have to say when i turned it on I didn't put it down for two hours. The weapons and disarms are awesome, and the amount of bad guys won't leave you wanting dissatisfied. I played it on the rookie level and though it is possible to die it's easy enough to stay alive and not get frustrated. Now for the problems. I have not beaten the game yet, but i'm almost on the last chapter and i must say it is a bit repititious. The plot skips around sometimes, and it's the same story, u go into a room and blast the bad guys until you can move on. I think it would have been more fun if u could go about the game being stealthy like Metal Gear Solid, but it's not like that. There are a few instances though where you can sneak up behind some people but they are rare, but exciting when they occur. So, all in all it is a pretty good game with a few problems."
2,It is a good game until u beat it... i suggest renting it..,Dead To Rights is an OK game... there are cool scenes and stuff but... it gets boring very quick.. if i were u i would rather by Enter The Matrix itsdead of this game.. if u want to try out this game i suggest renting it first.. who knows.. mabe u will like it.. to bad i didn't. ya well im gonna keep this short and rent it before u buy it!
4,an ok game,this game was fun and all and the controles were simple but there was too many miny-games that yoy hade to waste your time on in order to finish a levle
1,TRASH,If you have no values in life other than yourself this game is for you. I got rid of it as I did not want my dog to get any ideas. Cross the street and find a better game.
3,This game is worth a renal at best,"Dead to rights is a good game but not as good as Max PAyne to mePros:Syphon Filter and Max Payne like gameplayEnimies are challangingNice cutseenesAlot of gunsAdreniline mode helps alotI love using guys as shieldsUnlike Max Payne and Gabe, this dide can fightCons:A story ripped of from Max PayneUgly weapons system(can't hold alot of bullets)Not so good regular graphicsWhen weapons fire, sound like it has too much basscan't jumpNot so good musicNothin much to do after u beat itThis game is not as good as max payne, but it's worth checkin out. I'd suggest a rental at best, rather than a buy."
3,rent first,"Dead to Rights seemed interesting. I had bought Max Payne, Solid Snake, Grand Theft Auto and the Getaway and several other similar games of that genre and wasn't dissappointed. Unfortunatly I can't say the same for this one. It is engrossing, no lying about that, but there wasn't anything that kept my attention. The cut scenes were creativly done, but all you do is shoot, shoot, shoot, fist-fight alittle, die 18 million times and shoot some more; so much so that it left me feeling shell shocked. The ending was a letdown and the game was too short. The mini-games were weak and an unnecessary distraction (pushing buttons for a stripper to dance to distract bouncers? C'mon!) I had expected more challenges from these. The slow-motion diving was useless, too. I only used it twice in the game because you can still get shot while doing it and it's hard as hell to aim at enemies. I say before plopping down 50 dollars for it, RENT IT FIRST or wait until it goes on sale for 20 bucks(like I did)."
3,Good narrative but it's not history,"I bought this book believing that I was purchasing a history of the Asiatic fleet. What I got was a series of interesting narratives which were only very broadly structured and gave you little or no opportunity to glean the historical sequence of events. Don't get me wrong the accounts, mostly from first hand sources are gripping reading, but I was left rather disappointed and with the impression that I had read a book of short stories rather than a historical record."
2,I choose a wrong battery,I really don't know how to avaluate this product. I did a mistake and I will send back to you for you to change. That battery does not fit im my cancorder.
2,Graphics???,I bought this game because I really liked Cool Borders 3. When I started playing I really got turned off. The graphics really stink
5,Classic Cool Boarders. New 2 player slope style is great.,"Great game for 1 or 2 players. Make your own players and boards. New 2 player slope style is what cool boarders 3 fans were waiting for. Lots of fun from the start. Keeps fun value with challenge of beating records, learning harder tricks, and opening up new tracks."
2,Painfully slow.,"I bought this game expecting some fast, exciting, off-the-wall snowboarding action. I got quite the opposite. This game is weak, with snail-pace action, little incentive to do all the fancy tricks, and unremarkable graphics. I can tell that they were going for more of a simulation game, but this game is so difficult to control and frustrating that you are not likely to make it far before shutting off the game.There are a few pros. The 16 different boarders give you a diverse selection of strengths and weaknesses. I also like the ability to customize your boarder, which can give you the upper hand in a competition. But this doesn't amount to a whole lot. The game is still too slow. When it comes to the tricks, I was just tapping different keys randomly, trusting my luck. It gave up after a while.I have heard that Cool Boarders 3 was quite good, so maybe I will give that a try. But as for this one, I would pass on it altogether."
1,for gappers only,"being an avid snowboarder and gamer, I figured cool boarders 4 would be a great addition to my library. however, within 15 minutes of popping it into my station, I wanted to pop it out the window. the graphics arent that bad, but the play control and character dynamics are horrible. for the money youre better off getting a real lift ticket, or get Tony Hawks Pro Skater."
1,A big dissapointment,".......Cool boarders 3 is a lot better than 4.Here are mycomplaints 1. the boards go to ... slow, witch always puts me in 4th place in a race. 2.theres hardly any jumps to do any tricks. 3.coolboarders 3 starts you off with about 3 courses, and like maybe 6 or 7 players I think,just untill you do the tournement and unlock them all.And like a couple boards to choose from.cool boarders 4 only starts you off with 2 courses, and 2 players, and probably like 3 boards,............ I found it getting aggravating and boring fast.Lucky I got to take the game back and trade it in with the store I bought it at,After that I bought cool boarders 3, the better one.Where the boards go faster,u start off with more than two coarses,players,and boards.And you get big jumps to.So don't waste your money on this buy the 3rd one instead."
4,great with newer hard disks,"I tried using this with one of my very old laptop hard disk, about 8gb size, and it didn't work. I know the HD was fine because it did work with a USB adapter. I ended up hooking this up to a newer 80GB laptop hard disk, and it worked fine. I think these types of adapters just do not work with the very old hard disks.I didn't use the mounting bracket, but I didn't see any problem with it."
5,Better than expected.,"Picture came in swiftly, and the colors were richer than depicted. I bought this to go in the living room, and was hesitant at first due to the dull colors. However, they are a deeper red and more yellow in than tan."
3,"Proverbs 23:17, really?","Deciding on whether to buy the book, which has come as good recommended reading. Problem I'm having is that the scripture quoted in the opening paragraph of the description may be inaccurate. I did an online search of Proverbs 23:17 and, after reading variations on that Proverb from practically every text out there, I see nothing that comes close saying that the opening paragraph says it should. Who's the fact checker?"
5,Steve's review,I am a supervisor for research staff where every day I see instances where our staff could greatly benefit from the kind of understanding presented in this book. We could become a much better research organization by better understanding ourselves and the behavior of others. We could team among ourselves much more effectively.
3,Help Youself to Happiness,"This is an excellent book on cognitive reframing, however, the process he teaches is a little complicated for the average reader. I think his reframing process expounds on the ABC model of cognitive restructering by Ellis and Beck and could be used by professionals in the field to help their clients with their stinking thinking."
5,just love it!,"the verbena smells fresh and feels natural and clean. works well, but isn't drying. and it lasts along time. what else could you ask for???"
3,Expensive soap,I bought this and some cheaper soap. I can't really tell the difference. It is nice but not worth the extra money.
5,Best Liquid Soap In The World,I tried the verbena liquid soap and it's a perfect liquid soap. Never dries out your hands and the smell of verbena is gorgeous. I purchased it because my husband has terrible eczema on his hands. It's wonderful. A bit pricey. I also use the olive oil soap - just heavenly and the price is much better.
3,COMPILATION CD,"I'm a huge fan and supporter of LLV and MaW. Thus CD is a compilation of King Street tracks and I found the tracks to be average. It's not your normal LLV CD/production but if you are a die hard LLV and MaW fan then pick up this CD. Otherwise I would rate this as average and nothing special. However, I am a big supporter of King Street and Mr. V so I had to pick up this CD but already had all the tracks on this CD. There are about 6 hot tracks (in total) if that is of help. A must have for King Street, LLV, and MaW fans. I would rate this as a 3 (out of 5) compared to other solid house CD's."
4,Interesting Perspective,I have already enjoyed several books from John Gordon and this is no exception. Gordon provides some interesting information on the National Debt since the dawn of our nation. He ends with a stern warning about the wreckless nature of Washington's budgeting over the last 20 years.
5,informative. well-written,very good introduction to the financial history of US. i have learnt something from this book. also this book is well-written. and no dwelling on personal gossip of some of the historical figures.view of the author is rather sound and interesting.i recommend this.
3,"Nice introduction to the subject, but too political.","Hamilton's Blessing provides an excellent introduction to the subject of our national debt and the changes in our government's philosophy of finance over the years. Unfortunately, two of the most rewarding areas of analysis, the multiplier effect in the capital markets and the failure of the government to adhere to standard accounting principles, are given short shrift in favor of tired political arguments against the welfare state. The writing is always lucid and the historical importance of the debt on the early American economy is given an elegant exposition, but the book suffers for its brevity. Obviously, the work was not intended as a definitive study of the subject, but most chapters are truly parched for detail. In sum, a good read, but for anyone familiar with the subject, woefully incomplete."
4,Passes snob test,I am a furniture snob and I hate particle board anything or cheap cutting corners... well you know the stuff. These are solid wood and are very nice looking and feel of quality. Very pottery barn without having to buy the whole barn. Very strong and sturdy. I put some sticky felt circles from wal mart on the bottoms of the legs as not to scratch the hard woods.
5,Still strong and comfy after 3 1/2 years!,"I bought two of these chairs with matching drop leaf table in Dec. 2008 for my small kitchen. They are still in great shape and strong (not wobbly). They come with a distressed look which, in a busy household with kids, might look too worn and beat up. But after 3 !/2 years of low wear and tear, the chairs and tableCarolina Cottage Provence 42 inch Round Drop Leaf Dining Table are still great!"
4,nice for the price,I had 3 that I bought from Pottery barn and needed 3 more. They are $229 each at PB and these were about that for three. I have mixed them with the PB's and nobody has noticed.
1,main character is not very bright and becomes less than believable,About two thirds of the way through the plot disappears and the main character is just too ignorant be believable. The book turns into actions socially acceptible to 21 century readers but not credible in the Victorian age.
5,A perfect conclusion to Blair's Rogues Club Series,"You'll appreciate Christmas more after you read this book. And if you've read An Undeniable Rogue, An Unforgettable Rogue, and An Unmistakable Rogue, you have to read this book where all the couples come together. This one is about Ash, an aristocrat, and Lark, a guttersnipe. It's My Fair Lady with a laugh out loud bite, good sex and a Father Christmas who brings amazing gifts. Read it. You won't be sorry. No wonder it won so many awards. Try Blair's Witch series while you're at it. Those books are award winners too."
3,Untamed rogue,Starts out very good and is very funny. Gets a little weak as the story goes on. An ok read.
2,"Not Quite a""Keeper""","I bought this book on impulse, because what I read on the back cover made it sound like something I would enjoy. By the time I'd read the first few chapters, I was beginning to wonder if it had been a waste of money. Halfway through, I decided that it was. In spite of some endearing moments and a sufficiently happy (if unlikely) resolution, I still found myself regretting this purchase.A little more consistency might have helped, but not much. One detail that I just couldn't get past was the way Larkin (who was supposedly an uneducated ""guttersnipe"", raised in a rough tavern by an ignorant and indifferent father,) spoke like the commoner she was in one moment, yet sounded like a born-and-bred lady in the next.I could write a long and detailed list of all the things I didn't like about this book, but that would take up too much time and space. Simply put, my advice to prospective buyers is this: Don't bother."
5,One of the all time best Chrsitmas Romances!,"Annette Blair knows how to create characters that you never forget. From the Reluctant Hero and the Guttersnipe Bride to the myriad of extended family and friends, each character is delightful, well developed and endearing. Ms Blair must really know how to love people to be able to write such lovable characters.The story is a robust and exciting read that kept me laughing all night. (I just could not put it down!) I am partial to Christmas Romances and this one just hit all the right notes. I plan on making it a permanent part of my annual holiday reading list.I enthusiastically recomend this fourth book in the Rogue Series by Annette Blair. Once you've read it go back and read the first three! You can't miss."
4,A Good One,"You get the picture from the other reviews so suffice it to say it is worth the read especially since I lucked out and was able to download it free. This is a special author and I will continue giving her books attention. The only thing that I didn't like was the introduction of Brian into the story, I liked things the way they were but that's just me.Enjoy"
4,An author I could read again and again,"This period romance was delightful. It had a fun plot, albeit not typical for the era, and great character development. I took off points for the lack of editing and proof reading. One chapter Micah is Lark's nephew and the next her brother, among numerous others. How much would it take for an author to proof read and edit their books. Seems to me it would be worth it. Other than that, I truly enjoyed the book. I typically and not thrilled with blatant sex scenes, but this author does a great job of describing just enough, but not too much."
1,Wish I had stopped at book three,"I have never felt compelled to write a review before, but this book is so disappointing I felt I must. I looked forward to this fourth book in the Rogue series and wish now I had stopped at book three. The characters were just so unbelievable I couldn't force myself to go much past the first half of the book. The actions of Larkin especially made NO sense. Leave the Rogue series with a smile and stop at book three."
5,Fantastic,"This is a wonderful book, stayed up all night reading it and i couldn't put it down it was so exciting, i highly recommend this book :)"
2,Dis appointing,"The product worked well until the float filled with water through the seams. To inexpensive to send back, so I was able to separate the tank assembly and reglue properly. Works fine after my repair. Would not recommend. I used expoxy type glue which has held up for several weeks so far. Quality control needed by maker. Unit to an several hours to fill up with water. Very small leak."
5,What a wonderful book!,"Linda O'Brien is truly one of today's most exceptional authors. Although not yet widely known, Linda will surely take the country by storm with her latest novel, Beloved Protector. The brilliant prose combines character with passion, adventure with excitement, and will not leave you dissapointed. Unlike most of the literature written today, Linda's novels are sure to become an icon among romance writers worldwide. If you have not yet checked out her other works, I suggest you do so, fast!"
5,Incredible,"The information and research in this book concerning the travels of the Israelites and who they really are is incredible. Of all Mr. Capt's books he's written over the many years, this has to be his best! If you want an eye opening true history of true Israel, which most Christian churches deny, READ THIS BOOK. You can't help but agree with Mr. Capt. Very compelling and convincing."
1,Avoid this book like the plague,"Although this book purports to be a scholarly investigation of the lost tribes of Israel and their relation to Assyrian studies, there are odds bits and pieces in here that lead me to believe that the author has a strange, distorted agenda. Just one example: On page 36 he claims that the Semites, from intermarrying with the Hittites, acquired the so-called ""Jewish nose"" and he quotes the Haddon-Hammond's Library World Atlas from 1954 to support this claim! If he believes this strange nugget (and what exactly is a ""Jewish nose"" and how is it different from the one on Capt's face?), what other distortions does he commit?"
1,"Inadequate, Noisy, Irritating","If you want a decent UPS you're going to pay more than $30. This UPS is totally underpowered for a computer sporting a decent processor and graphics card. The moment the computer starts drawing more power than the battery could supply *if* the power was out, you will receive an audible overload warning: a piercing whine which CANNOT be silenced by pushing the ""silence"" button on the front of the unit. At present the only thing plugged into the battery-backed-up outlets on my 400VA are the CPU itself... not even the monitor is plugged in (and how am I going to shut the machine down if I can't see anything on the monitor?)The 400 VA is USELESS. I strongly recommend you give it a miss and buy a real UPS. It's shocking that the 400 VA is the best UPS HP will offer you if you configure a computer at their website, even if that computer draws more power than the 400 VA can supply."
3,The Heat of Middle Water,"Sober, judicious, temperate, suave, Pinsky considers poetry's place in our high-tech democracy with all the passion of a required civics course. Nary an insight will trouble anyone's sleep in NPR, MacNeill/Lehrer America, and that's a shame, because poetry at its best is a whole lot hotter than that. Pinsky's a deft explainer and he keeps his good-natured balance in the midst of a very fragmented field. But I think those qualities mitigate against the kind of fire we need to shake poetry loose from the warm academic middle, whose virtues and limitations Pinksy embodies in every line of his prose."
4,GREAT!,Pocket Size... But Can not use your pockets LOL! A Must HAVE to look Semper Fabulous!!!!!! Only thing that could be better if it was laminated .. every page... Orahh!
1,Repairs have already exceeded cost of fridge,"We bought this fridge in 2006 and in the last 6 months have had two repairs, one to the defrost control, and one to the icemaker totaling over $500. That's as much as the fridge cost. Unacceptable."
3,expensive,"There's no question these wipes work well. However, paying $.50 per wipe ($9 for 18 wipes??) seems a little ridiculous! I've switched over to using Pledge's Multi-purpose wipes, which are cheaper. I think you could find both varieties for cheaper at the local store though, so look there first!"
5,Great for polishing,I love to use these to polish my wood furniture. It works great and I love the smell. Love these!
1,not as advetised.,"The order i received is not the product as it was advertised. The items i received are the regular pledge lemon wipes, NOT the pledge lemon furniture wipe. While these two are used on same purpose, they are clearly two different product. The regular pledge lemon wipes has big blue pledge logo on its pack(which i received) and the furniture wipes has the wood image on its front like above advertised(which i'm supposed to receive)."
5,Don't own yet,"I haven't purchased this book yet. I saw just one picture, of the Hawaiian Islands, and I intend to purchase this book as a gift soon. The picture was amazingly beautiful, ethereal, what the world must have looked like at creation."
4,A lesson on South Dakota,"South Dakota has a lot going for it, and this book will show you and your students what.The ""Portrait of America"" series is a terrific and easy to understand introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This ""South Dakota"" installment is very good. The book is broken down into sections like ""History"", ""Culture"", ""Economy"" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited.This book, as well as the entire ""Portrait of America"" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators"
5,Beautifully Inspirational and Spiritually Informative,"I received Joseph's book as a gift...a true gift it was. Being a Client of Joseph's and being privileged to experience his Healing Programs and the use of his products, this book was naturally the next experience for me. It's wonderful to have knowledge so vital to our very being, shared, and Living in Beauty shares the knowledge of Marma science with the inspirational power to guide anyone toward their desired state of health, beauty and vitality. This is a beautiful book written by a truly beautiful Master."
2,FITS TOO LOOSELY IN CONNECTOR SOCKET,"I purchased this as a replacement adapter for a Dell Inspiron 1150 laptop. It works fine in providing power while plugged into the laptop's AC adapter connector. However, the fit is VERY loose; in fact, it just sort of ""sits"" in the connector socket. The slightest tap of the adapter cord or nudge of the laptop causes it to slide right out. I would not purchase this adapter from this vendor again, even if the price was still more attractive than those offered by other vendors."
5,well done!,It came wrapped well for protection of the spine and cover and looked like new. It arrived before Christmas too.
2,Too basic....,"I purchase this dictionary for my 9 year old daughter, that is learning English as her second language. Although the book has nice pictures and seems to be designed for the use of young school kids, the choice of words included has tremendous gaps if it to be used by a young student. As an example neither ecology, nor ecosystem are defined in the book...and there is no doubt that those words are used almost daily in today's school curricula."
5,Brilliant,"Like the Velvet Underground, Can were well ahead of their time. In some ways the world caught up with Velvet Underground, but it still hasn't caught up with Can. Can's music is still unequalled and unsurpassed - much of what counts today as 'modern' music still sounds outdated next to the work Can did well before the 1990s. The likes of Eno, Sonic Youth, Bruce Gilbert of Wire, UNKLE and the Orb all list Can as a big influence (see Can's Sacrilege CD for mixes by those artists) and that tells you something of what Can sounds like. Some Can members were also classically trained by the composer Stockhaussen. I highly recommend you try Can and this CD is the best place to start for the novice. Listen to this compilation a few times and I am sure you'll be buying the rest of their CDs soon."
3,"OK , but their early stuff is the best...","I picked this up thinking it would be a nice overview of Can's lenghty discography, and it is, but I'm a little disappointed. The first disc, which I believe is the same as Canabalisms 1, is the superior disc. The songs from Tago Mago, Monster Movie and Soundtracks are great stuff, with the fuzz guitar and psychedelic bent. Disc 2 is more spotty. Future Days is certainly a classic, and there are a few decent tunes as well, but the later Can material doesn't do much for me. It's nowhere as dynamic and spacey sounding as their earlier, more vital work. The lack of liner notes or album references is unfortunate as well. What this compilation did for me was make me want to go back and buy Can's first couple of records since I now know how great they are."
3,Inaccessable to all but the most patient and indulgent,"Can were certainly ahead of their time, which is not necessarily a good thing. While their music is brimming with sonic invention and experimentation, the result is not always a rewarding or even an engaging musical experience. If your appreciation of music is intellectual, where the ideas are more important than the form, then Can may be just the ticket. If, however, your needs are more immediate, then Can, like Stockhausen, is best experienced as a distant echo in the work of other musicians."
2,Not compatable with Windows XP,"I purchased my Lexmark X73 a little over a year ago,it worked well with Windows 98 SE and printed great pictures , but then I purchased a new computer with Windows XP, the instructions with the scanner-printer said it would work with XP, but so far I have tried three times to install it, once with Lexmark downloading the software from their website, but the scanner program doesn't work correctly and the printer only prints in black and white,nothing like it was with Windows 98,So I guess if your running earlier programs the Lexmark might rate a 3.5 or a 4 , but if you ever think you might run XP it's junk."
5,A delightful album that doesn't age at all,"I bought this album back in 98 on a whim after listening to a cut at one of those headphone stations in the record store. Sounded like something worth a spin. And years later this CD has been a soundtrack of various parts of my life.The style reminds me of some Peter Gabriel, a bit of Eno, Afro Celts and World Music / Electronica except this is more low key and richer in some way. So if those names exist in your library then you're on the right page here.I'm busy ripping old CDs in boxes to finish off my digital conversion and this was near the bottom of the box. I looked on Amazon to see if there was anything new from them, what happened to them or anything. Not much. Incredibly you can still buy their CD. If you're thinking about it then do so while you have the chance."
2,A Great Story Poorly Told,"This book tells an interesting story. One of my college classmates was a member of the 87th Chemical Mortar Battalion - the subject of this book - and found the information to be accurate. However, it is a self-published book and suffers from the major shortcoming of that genre: a lack of copyediting and proofreading. The very first paragraph of Chapter 1 contains a typographical error, a punctuation error, and a grammatical error. Because of errors like these, the book is sometimes difficult for a person like me -- a retired editor -- to read. Nevertheless, I found it worth the effort."
4,Really Pleased,I've installed this about a year ago for a customer. It was easy to installed and worked really well at detecting moving objets. I have set up the system to sound an alarm whenever a moving metal object is detected.Everything was hard wire.The only complaint i had was that it was really affected by static. Besides that it works pretty good.This is a really neat alert if you want some security for your house and driveway.
4,Decent history magazine,"This is a decent history magazine for the price. The better magazines are pretty much cost prohibitive, so this is a nice alternative for history buffs. It usually includes a variety of articles, usually about lesser known historical events. The writing is nicely done, never too scholarly, and easy to read. For those who are historians by profession or history students, it might be a little on the ""light"" side, but if you simply enjoy reading about little-known historic, trivia-like events then this is the magazine for you."
4,I Like History,"Out of all of the history magazines I subscribe to, this is one. There are many good articles and an occasional poor one. I really don't know what to say about it except that it is worth the money to me. It gives me a couple of good hours of reading every time it comes."
3,Received late but 3 issues bundled,It took several months and a couple of emails before this gift subscription started but a package has finally arrived for my Dad with three issues of the magazine inside. He said the articles looked interesting and was eager to start reading them.
5,The best set of songs from Cliff Richard ever.,"I have been a long time fan of Cliff Richard and this CD is by far the best work he has ever done. Each time I listen to it, the music is trapped in my mind for days. He is Heathcliff, and the songs transport you to the moors of ""Wuthering Heights"". A number of songs are duets with Olivia Newton-John and she sounds as beautiful as ever. If you're looking for dance music, this is not it! This is music to carry you away to another time, another place. It is one of my all time favorites."
4,Forever Perry Como,"I am so glad I purchased this CD. Perry Como has always been one of the finest singers from the USA. From It's Impossible to And I love you so, Perry proved he was still a viable and likeable singer in the rockin, dancin, Disco 70's. His version of We only just begun and Close to you will make you forget the Carpenters. He covers many of the songs from that era in his soft casual manner, and you will sing along with him too.Perry is a part of our lives from season to season and all the holidays.You will really enjoy him as an aging crooner who can still sing and bring joy to your life. We all truly lost one of the great ones May 12, 2001, but his voice and songs live on and on."
4,PERRY COMO A GOOD ALBUM,"THAT WAS A GOOD PACKAGE BUY ONE GET TWO ALBUM .PERRY COMO WAS A GREAT SINGER WITH A SPECIFIC VOICE AND VERY COOL.I HAD LOOKING SINCE MANY YEARS TO GET THIS ALBUM ON CD,BECAUSE I ALREADY HAD THE LP'S AND CASSETTE BEFORE."
2,Not all songs play.,"Just received this CD, primarily for And I Love YoU So. First 12 songs played fine but last 8 will not play.And I Love You So/It's ImpossibleDo not buy if you mind getting up after 1st 11 songs & shutting off or replaying."
2,really weak at times and boring,"perrys recordings of and i love you so and its impossible are of course great but all the other songs are weak and utterly boring the two songs something, for the good times are good though but they can be replaced with frank sinatras versons any day.If como had taken nelson riddles aranegments on the recording of for the good times and used that along with his voice it probably could have been a heck of a lot better than franks but who knows."
3,Who knows if these work,"These aren't meant to make your vision better, only to maintain what you've got already. There's no good way to tell if these work or not. I can't really give it a good or bad review... they don't taste bad."
3,"Very useful, a little hard to figure out how to use at first","Very useful device. I haven't tried any other brands, so I don't know if any others are better. It takes a bit to figure out how to use this consistently well, but now that I have, I am glad to have purchased it. Be careful you've got something hard under the paper your cutting so that you don't cut into your table surface and for contrast with the paper to make a cleaner cut. Also be aware that the blades are stored in the clear cylinders topped by the blue plastic dots, otherwise you won't be able to figure out how to use this.It does make circles of various sizes, the smallest is bigger than a hole puncher, and the largest is about six-seven inches. You can tighten it so it will remain consistent over several cuts if you want that."
2,Major disappointment,Purchased this item as part of a set. Works only on the thinest of paper and then it is hit or miss. Must tape the paper down and exert pressure with both hands while turning it. Found it frustating and difficult to use.
3,Disappointed,"Works OK on thinner papers, but it's very difficult to get a good cut without skipping any parts of the circle when you're using thicker paper. Thought I would be able to use this for my wedding invitations, but it isn't getting the job done."
2,Not the best,"I purchased this tool for cutting circles. I found it very difficult to use. As stated in another review, it did not work well with thick cardstock paper but with thin paper. You have to apply pressure to hold it in place (my wrist was sore after using this product). I will be returning this tool for a refund."
3,Not Fiskars best product,"I wanted this item to cut shrink plastic with. It barely works with a lot of effort. It seems to work fine on a light weight paper, but this product will not stand up to heavier uses."
2,Not the best circle cutter option,This item was recommended by someone I trust so I spent the extra money on this one. I was very disaponited. The circles never looked descent. I watched a youtube video to make sure I was using it correctly and I was. I would say get the circle puncher instead.
4,I love my little circle cutter,"I love my circle cutter. Before purchasing it I looked at the other reviews and I was a little nervous purchasing it, but I found it really cheap ($7) and couldn't pass up the offer. When I got home and began to cut circles (back in October) I found it to be really easy and fun to use. The only thing I would change about this particular circle cutter is that the spare blades fall out of the designated area for spare blades when storing it, or not being used. Other than that this circle cutter is on point with its cuts and I've yet to have a problem"
1,I hate it,"I wish I had kept my packaging so I could return this. It slides all over when cutting photos. No matter how careful I am, I end up with a lopsided circle. Keep your money."
4,Cuts big circles on cardstock,"I had to make 160x8"" circles on cardstock for a wedding DIY project. Very few circle cutters can cut that big of a size, but this one does. It wasn't painless, but this circle cutter did the job. You have to press down hard on the center to make sure the cutter didn't shift mid-cut. The 2 replacement blades came in handy."
2,"Ok, not great","I got this to cut out specific circles on a sheet set up in rows like labels. This will cut an circle, but not in cardstock, and not exactly where you want it. Good for cutting out a circle in a random pattern on regular paper."
2,OK if all you're cutting is typewriter paper,"When this circle cutter arrived I tested it out on a sheet of typewriter paper, and it made a clean cut and a little circle of paper popped out. When I tried it on a variety of artisan papers that were slightly thicker, however, the product failed and could not cope with any extra thickness because its blade is too shallow.In addition, the so-called guides to set up a circle's diameter are a joke, and trial-and-error seem to be the only way to get a precise measurement.Given these two failures, it's not really worth piling on to add that the entire cutter is an awkward mess of a design, but it is. I only bought this because I used to believe that Fiskars makes quality products. I was wrong."
4,Learning curve,This works great for cutting circles. It does require some practice to get it to work effectively and efficiently. I recommend getting a self-healing mat to use with this product. My hand did get a little sore after using this since it takes some force to press down the center stopper. I also taped my paper down to ensure it wouldn't move. The circles aren't always perfect but more practice helps with that.
2,eh,"cheap quality, moves around when you revolve the blade, so circles are not perfect, has many quality flaws. plastic flexes, the grip at the bottom center doesnt grip the paper, but if youre just cutting for cutting's sake nothing important, just something sketch, this is a product to buy."
4,Review of circle cutter,I discovered how to use product and it works fine. Disregard request to return item.
2,mostly an outdated 80's synth sound,"I love Anna Domino's voice and her recent work with Snakefarm. So I have been anxious to get other examples of her music. Unfortunately the music on this CD (originally from 1987) sounds very outdated and is hard to listen to even though it has been remastered for this release. Her voice is strong, however. There are some bonus tracks and an updated (remake) version of one song from 1996. I will next try to get some of her later work."
2,almond extract not in a brown bottle,This product is not what is seems. I thought it would come in a brown bottle but it came it a plastic clear container. I would not have purchasedit. The product is just o.k..
2,"Stella Cameron fans might like this, but I didn't","I bought this expensive paperback because of rave Amazon reviews, but I was disappointed. I thought the writing was overly romanticized, and the lead characters annoyed me. Right from the start, they called each other ""sweetness"" and ""bucko"" far too often for me and swilled Asti Spumanti and scotch faster than I can drink water. It was hard for me to sympathize with the lead characters who married complete psychos that they barely knew. If you are a true romance reader looking for a hot read, this might suit you. If you are a suspense/mystery reader that likes a romantic subplot, this may not be for you."
1,Why the good reviews?????,"The very first paragraph contains a glaring typo: tailor-maid instead of tailor-made. Many words are spelled incorrectly over and over (fiance, for example, is not feiance or, in the case of a male, fiancee). Verb tenses change so often that it is rather unbelievable. There is no editing whatsoever.I can forgive typos and spelling if the plot is good. However, the plot is predictable, the characters ridiculous and the dialogue is embarrassingly off base.This is a painfully bad book. I am not exaggerating."
5,A Very Enticing Book,This is an excellent read! Victoria has a way of drawing you into the world which she creates within her book. She has a seductive way with words which kept my attention focused on the characters througout the story. My only question is when is the sequel coming? I would highly recommend this book.
5,"Move Over Danielle Steele, Lori Forster, and Cherry Adair","Finally, a romance/mystery writer that can write her butt off. This novel will keep you on the edge of your seating and leave you wanting more. Now with the 2nd installment ""Forbidden"" of this ten book series, I am in awe of what streams out of the pen of the magical author. Hold on world, because this lady really rocks! As Christy French wrote, ""This writer possesses a wonderful descriptive talent."" Hopefully there's a movie deal for her in the offing, even as I write. Because this book would make one hell of a movie!"
4,"Tons of fun with this one,","THIEF OF HEARTS was a ton of fun for me. Love this type of genre and thought the 1st book of this series was a blast. I look forward to my next trip to LAMBERT in book 2, FORBIDDEN."
3,A series that I believe will get better and better...,"Thief of Hearts by writer Murray is a series that I believe will get better and better. I don't mean this in a bad way, but I could tell this book was this writer's first attempt at writing, too bad her publisher didn't help her out a little more in the editing department...that being said, I would like to say that I really liked this book. The story is great. Kept me guessing throughout the whole book what was going to happen next. I look forward to the next book in Ms. Murray's Lambert series. I like the characters, the dialogue and the on-going plot of the story. I'm ordering book 2 of this series now. The way the book ended left me with a feeling that I wanted to read more. I would have given this book 5 stars had it not been for the obvious lack of editing on the publisher's part."
5,Superb Cuisine of Suspense and Seduction,"What more can anyone say after so many rave reviews? Victoria Taylor Murray has achieved what so many writers only dream about--readers who love her books and want more. This series is the kind of reading you savor for that get-away time at the cottage or long train or plane ride, and if you are lucky enough to go on a cruise, having VTM along to read is another bit of wonderful entertainment to enjoy. As other reviewers advise, the best treat you can give yourself is to buy the entire series so you don't have to wait, as everyone else did, for your next novel to come out. Thank you, Victoria, for giving us a romping good time. Now, how long do we have wait for another series like this one? Not long, I hope."
5,Different But Fun!,"I thought this story was different but fun. No one except Nouri Sommers (the female lead) is as they seem. A lot of characters to weave together and apparently it takes four books to get to them all, I look forward to the challenge."
5,Great Beginning!,"This is the first in the Lambert series by Victoria Taylor Murray and a must-read for any romance/mystery reader. Full of suspense, sizzling romance, twists and turns, and you won't want to put it down. As I stated in another review, this author is a mix between a more intelligent Danielle Steel and naughtier Mary Higgins Clark. Great style! Am anxiously awaiting the second in the series!"
3,Potentially good,"I like the author's style; a bawdy lady that is unafraid to tell an erotic tale, and even the concept of the novel was good---though not original--- but a professional edit is a must; just a simple spell check may have helped. The author gets happy with a phrase or an adjective and soon everyone is using it. The mistakes are intrusive and perpetual throughout the book and keeps you from getting into the flow, so this book that is barely larger than a novella becomes a chore to read. Miss Murray must focus on character development and dialogue, so that everyone does not respond in the same voice and interact and react identically. The story is set in the right place and all the characters are gathered for an epic adventure, but the thriller aspect was never realized. Perhaps if she takes one more stab at it once she develops her abilities, she may yet get it. . . this could've been a sensational book."
4,"A soap to lavish in,","The main character in this hot new romantic murder mystery, (Nouri), reminds me of myself in a way especially how she enjoys soaking in a hot bubble bath as she writes in her journal. I, too, started writing in my ""escape journals"" while I was in college, of course, my life doesn't come close to Nouri Sommers in other ways, many other ways but when I read how Nouri secretly enjoys soaking in bubbles up to her neck, sipping on wine, and writing about the romance she so craves, I had to chuckle. My first thought was oh, my god...Nouri and I have a lot in common, hahaha... Anyway, I was pulled into this fancy soap right from the start and ended up staying for the long haul of the three remaining books in the Lambert series. This story gave me a ton of pleasure and I discovered a fine new writer that I enjoy in the process. I'll look forward to more books by this writer in the future. I can see why so many quickly become a fan of this fun writer!"
5,Exceptional Drama!,I have read all four books in Ms. Murray's Lambert series and I have enjoyed each of them. The ongoing story line is highly entertaining and filled with rich characterization...an exceptional drama!
5,Give yourself a treat - read this series,"What a wonderful idea: Take one week in the life of a beautiful, rich young woman, add a disappearing husband which turns into a mystery with plenty of twist and turns, oodles of characters - some you love, some you hate, and sizzing sensual scenes, then carry the plot through for four books.Fabulous series. One that stays interesting and keeps getting better and better. Bravo!"
1,Please heed the warnings!,"I realize I am repeating what the other 1-star reviewers have said, but it hurts me to think of someone spending good money on this trainwreck of a book. Yes, it really is as bad as they say. I knew I was in for a rough ride when ""hot, silky bubble bath"" and ""hot, silky water"" were both used within a paragraph of each other on the very first page. Horrible spelling and punctation, elementary writing style, dialogue that sounds like it is coming out of the mouths of teenagers from the 80s, and shallow characters that are in no way endearing. It truly is the worst book I have ever read. I picked this up at half price at a UBS, but still think I got ripped off. If you choose to buy it anyway, you cannot say you weren't warned."
1,mislead,"I bought this book because it (or others in the series) kept showing up in people's lists as recommended. It was included in lists of mystery books that I have read and enjoyed but....it has to be one of the worst books I have ever read - hopeless! It is very, very, very poorly written (and very repetitive too!). Although some of the reviews say the others get better I am not spending money on them on the remote chance that they are of the same caliber - they certainly can't be worse."
5,Fantastic Bubble Bath Read!,I am the type of person who enjoys relaxing in a hot bubble bath as I read a few chapters of my favorite romance novel. Thief of Hearts is the perfect book for doing just that! I had a lot of fun reading the first installment of this new romantic suspense series. I can hardly wait until the next book arrives!
5,"Passion-A-Plenty, Secrets-A-Plenty, Equal One Good Story!","I have been an avid reader of romance novels for many years and anytime I discover a new writer that I like, I like to share that writer with the world. Well, this writer is one of those kind of writers. I fell in love with Victoria and her fun adult fantasy series after reading all four books while I was on vacation. I found her series highly entertaining and like most of the people who have posted an honest review of this book (series), have become a Lambert fan too. Way to go, Victoria! Thanks for providing me such a fun few hours of relaxation."
5,Wonderful and sexy entertainment,"I love escaping in fantasy! What a great job on your debut book. Wealth, passion, and suspense makes this book a delightful read."
2,It Did Not Steal My Heart,I must admit that I was let down after reading all of the other raving reviews.The book was difficult or a bit rough to read. In several areas there were typos or just no direction and as a result I had a hard time determining whether it was a narration or a character speaking. Plus there were a couple of areas that just did not flow real well. It was like the author was jumping around or lost focus about what she was writting about. The plot was good and had great potential and there was a deal of suspense but unfortunatly the hard spots made it difficult to follow. If you are willing to overlook these items then by all means purchase the book. This author has potential and I hope that she lives up to this potential in the following books.
5,"""Delicious, Naughty, Nice""","Oh, my goodness! This story quite simply rocks! Page turning seduction, romance, and intriguing suspense. I liked the writing style of this writer, and I thought she did an admirable job in the creation of her make-believe island paradise of Lambert. The story is mysterious, the characters sparkling, and the on going saga made me want to continue my journey deeper into the naughty but nice world of the super rich. I can hardly wait to read more of the series it was that interesting!"
4,"Higly Recommended,","If you are a lover of this genre like I am then the Lambert series by Victoria T. Murray, is the 4 bk-series for you. As the 4-bk series connects one into the other you will be drawn into the magical world of the ultra-rich. I was so engrossed in the story that I was surprised how quickly I finished each book. I enjoy this writer and will be on the lookout for more by her in the future. Nice job, fun series!"
5,Murder & Mayhem On A Resort Island!,I throughly enjoyed book 1 of the Lambert seres by V.T. Murray. Mainstream romantic mystery combining passion and intrigue. The story kept me flipping through the pages as I got to know more and more about Nouri Sommers and other characters in the story. I was a little disappointed that the book ended so fast but that's okay I went ahead and ordered the remaining 3 in the series. I have now read all 4 books and would like to say I had a fun time of it and I highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys this genre.
2,I love Ride. I hate this CD.,"An extremely disappointing CD from a once-great band. Long-time fans probably know this already - but if you're someone who's heard good things about Ride and are thinking of getting something by them, buy ANYTHING but this one. Everything else they've done is great, I swear. (I've never heard the live cd, though)"
1,This album is trash,"Everyone and anyone who has a clue about this band, knows this album was created to fulfill a contract. Every good fan of the band knew they were done-for prior to the album's release.Stick with Going Blank Again, Nowhere and the B-sides from the time period - some of the best music you'll ever hear. I wish Amazon would offer the Twiseterlla single CD, and the Going Blank Again single CD - both have amazing b-sides on them. Carnival of Light is tolerable, but barely.But stay away from Tarantula, it's garbage unfortunately."
3,OK,"When I bought Tarantula I really hated it. I couldn't figure out why they did a record like this when they had a unique style of their own. That can never be said about Tarantula. There's nothing original, or any Ride-feeling on this one. Just old school rock'n roll. The guitarplaying is completely different to the first records. Instead of trippy melodic lines Bell pushes out some blues riffs in Noel Gallegher style,, though it sounds better. Anyhow, this is NOT a crappy record, not at all. If you just can accept it for what it is it's really good wiht some great songs on it but there are fillers as well.The better ones are: Mary Anne, Dead Man, Walk on Water and the Dawn Patrol. Black Night Crash, Gonna be alright and Burnin' are good as well. The rest is pretty boring. Some people seems to like Deep inside my pocket but thats just a boring filler to me. Tarantula is good but not good enogh to reach four stars."
5,Very very underrated album,"Nice album. Pay no attention to the negative reviews here as they appear to be written by the same person, no doubt crestfallen over the band's change of direction from their ""shoegazer"" days.Take the album for what it's worth, the music. And dammit, this album rocks."
5,steamy,"A read as sensual and rich as the velvet city itself. A travelogue that would make mother blush, but an adventure into intimacy and relationships that would make any modern woman want to explore."
4,An Excellent Debut,"I have only just begun *Rescue Me*, but already I can vouch for its actual worth. Not only is it erotic, it is playful and wise--in other words, the whole range of human experience, which is what it should be. Not boring."
2,Not 12x12,This pillow is not 12x12 unless you stretch it as far as the material will allow and still fudge the numbers.
5,Gets better with time,"Fits my 2002 Mazda 626 perfectly, performance with these actually gets better with time.If nothing else they'll be a few less paper air filters that I would have thrown away if I didn't buy this permanent filter. Go Green!"
4,A basic reference book for older children and adults,"This is a classic, plus the price is right. A much, muchearlier edition of this book (copyright 1966) was one of the firsthorse books I purchased; and it is still on my shelves, although a bit tattered. It has a little bit of everything for the beginner, in a easy to read but not insulting style. Some on confirmation, some on riding, some on horse care, some on feeding, some on breeds, etc. I used it as primary curriculum while tutoring a reading student, who was also horse crazy. Later, the excellent drawings were useful in teaching the English names for the parts of a horse to an ESL class of Spanish speaking farm workers. I think this book and ""Happy Horsemanship"" should be the first two horse books any new-to-horses adult or child should read."
2,Klutzy and Impatient Folks Beware!,"I should've known that there would be trouble when I nearly ran into the wall trying to do the ""Axl Rose"" move. But after watching Amy Bento's latest dvd, ""All Cardio-Hi-Lo Knockout"" a few more times, I finally gave up and called it a day. This dvd was just too confusing for me. While I did work up a sweat, I was too frustruated after surviving all of the complex choreography to appreciate it. Heck, I was trying so hard to keep up with Bento and company's movements that I barely noticed the allegedly good background music mentioned by so many other reviewers! I recommend this dvd only to those with lots of time, patience, and living room space."
1,Too Crazy!!,"I put this dvd in an shut if off within less than 5 mins. I thought this would be a great workout because of all the positive reviews. I was shocked after the first couple seconds that this workout actually had as many great reviews as it does. I have worked out for 12 yrs. using dvds or videos. This is the 1st one I tossed in the trash. I like Amy...she's very nice. However, this is way too fast and crazy. No way to focus on getting a great workout due to the fact that you have to figure out every move they are doing on your own with no modificaton of any kind. It's so fast you can't concentrate. Sorry, but this was officailly the worst excercise dvd I have ever purchased. Thankful that I bought it used!!"
4,"Would have given it five stars, but...","...for the price, seems like a case should have been included. Very nice, precision Calipers though. Next time, I'll make sure to order the case as well..."
1,Not So Pleased,"Directions were in pictures,ONLY--very confusing for me to put together. Quality of wood is cheap and it is not finished off very well---I've had to repaint every tray and put high gloss varnish on each one. I received these trays in Jan. and I'm STILL painting and varnishing them. The ones I've redone have been sturdy enough to eat off of. I would NOT recommend these to anyone else!!"
2,"Unfunny, Undubbed, Unlikable","Basically this is a new Galaxy Angel cast, with unlikable characters, unlikable stories, and pretty much everything that was good about Galaxy Angel before this series gone.I wonder what these people were thinking before they made Rune, the previous cast had lots of life left in them, they didn't need replacing.Anyway on to the facts- DVD contains 4 episodes- Japanese audio audio, with Eng subs- No English dubAnd lastly, Bandai Visual USA who had the license to this went out of business so really, you'd be buying this with no company to support except maybe Amazon or the seller who gets the money from you.Avoid this show if you love the previous Galaxy Angel shows."
3,Great Mouse...If all your BT products are also Microsoft,"I give this product only 3 stars because it works great if you have just Microsoft Bluetooth products, i.e. their keyboard and mouse but is questionable if you also want to talk to other non-Microsoft products. It will not work (with current software) with the Nokia 3650. If you want to talk to other devices than you should seriously look into the technology (stacks, serial implementations, etc.). Just because it supports Bluetooth doesn't mean it supports ALL of Bluetooth."
1,WARNING!!! This mouse is a dead paper weight.,"I bought this mouse on the recommendation from a friend who had read about it... was this ever the biggest mistake EVER. Not only does it not function with my built in Bluetooth as is, it requires this stoopid looking do-daddle transciever that has to be plugged into the back of the laptop (Sticking out about 4 inches). In addition to this ""less than sleek look"", the device functioned in a very spasmatic fashion leaving me to think I must be developing MS.I mean seriously, who does Microsoft think they are putting out this level of crap and expecting people to buy it at such an outstanding price? This purchase is going back to the store tomorrow, and my friend that turned me onto this mouse... may be lost..."
1,HAVING PROBLEM WITH INSTALL,"I install the software and the usb laptop transreceiver connection and the pc laptop did not recognize it. I would like to say that the laptop have built in bluetooth so I really don't know whether or not I should use that usb transreceiver for the laptop either way it did not work, with or without."
1,Terrible Mouse - DO NOT BUY IT,"I hate this mouse. Its a piece of [junk] - not worth the [money amount]price. The first time I installed it on my PC, the device could never be identified nor connected. I called MS Tech Support and they were no help. They had me uninstall the drivers - that didn't work. Two days of trial and error without success. I ended performing a clean install of XP, to finally get it to work.It also goes through a set of batteries every 2 weeks. My wife's logitech mouse goes 3 months without needing new batteries.The moulse also don't have drivers for Mac OSX, which means the multiple buttons don't work. It will connect and Mac OSX does recognize the device."
2,Traveler not considered,"If you're like me you purchased the bluetooth mouse to have one less cable to worry about. Well, that may be the case, but now I have the annoying task of always keeping a second set of batteries and having to remove and install batteries. What were they thinking? Every product should have an off button ... I guess they were counting on their power management system, which causes the mouse to hibernate to save power, but this just causes a serious delay in waking the mouse up.I was very disappointed with these features and the slow response of the mouse. If you are used to a quick response from a wired mouse, this product will certainly cause you to gain a certain level of patience for your mouse activities.Someone please tell me of a better product that is more traveler friendly and doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
3,Microsoft Bluetooth Intellimouse,"Installed this mouse on my IBM Thinkpad T42. It works fine with the installed Bluetooth on the laptop, so the supplied USB Bluetooth dongle can be safely retired. All the features work fine and, so far I've had no trouble, but the lack of an on/off switch is a serious limitation if you're carrying the mouse around in a laptop bag. I have Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and have not encountered any of the other problems people have reported. The IBM Ultranav touchpad drivers work fine and the MS software did not want to uninstall them. On the box that I received with the mouse there was no mention (as some others have reported) of having to uninstall other Bluetooth devices. My T42 internal Bluetooth device works fine now - both with the mouse and with my Nokia 6600 mobile phone (which has a Bluetooth interface)- so it appears that the MS software has not interfered with this at all. Apart from the on/off switch issue, it's great"
3,Batteries are this mouse's downfall,"This mouse eats a pair of batteries in about 16 hours of usage. 50% of the time when I replace the batteries and then hit the button on the bottom of the mouse, it works for about 10 seconds, then stops communicating with the bluetooth receiver. I then have to shut down and restart my computer with a wired mouse connected, and run through the software utility to reconnect the mouse. This only works sporadically. Often I have to remove the mouse from the known devices in the control panel, reinstall it, and hope that works, which has about an 80% success rate. Just replacing batteries on a device that goes through them so quickly should NOT be such a chore."
2,"Works great, when it works","This is my 4th wireless mouse, and the only one that I've owned that is sufficiently smooth and accurate for gaming. Its also reasonably easy on the batteries. Ergonomically, its great. Just one problem, and its a big one. Sometimes it just stops working. Sometimes re-establishing the connection through the control panel will work, sometimes not. Sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work, sometimes not. Sometimes absolutely nothing can be done to get it to work, but then the next day it will be working fine.If the mouse spirits are kind to you, you'll love this mouse. If not, you'll curse it"
2,Slow curser response,"Everthing about this mouse works great with my PC: The bluetooth connection, buttons and how they feel, the overall feel of the mouse. I just can't stand how sluggish the curser respond to movement. I adjusted on my PC maximum curser speed, and still it's just annoyingly slow."
1,"Mouse Good, Dongle Junk",The Mouse is very nice works great but the Bluetooth dongle is a piece of junk! The slighest pressure in the wrong direction and it is toast! If you purchase this mouse be prepared to also by a replacement dongle which incidently microsoft does not sell seperatly!!!!!
1,"Wow, This realy doesn't work",I'm a big fan of optical mice but the Bluetooth is just not ready. It works... then it doesn't. I'm tired of reinstalling it on my XP Professional system (You'd think that cause they both say Microsoft they work together???).
4,Excellent Mouse That's Over Packaged,"I bought this mouse to use with my new Macintosh PowerBook 17"" with built-in BlueTooth. The mouse does not officially list Mac as a supported platform (go figure) but it works great. Just put in the batteries, press the button on the bottom of the mouse and go through the mouse set-up on OS X (requires 10.2.5 or later, I think.) After that, it's a great mouse. Takes a moment to wake up sometimes if you haven't used it in a while, but not a problem. The one problem is that the mouse is sold only with a BlueTooth USB adapter (and a really complicated one) which I don't need. This must bring the price up. ...Moreover I was thinking of getting the BT keyboard, but I'd end up with another adapter I don't need."
1,why no off button?,"I'm giving up on this mouse, 'cause it eats batteries, and the manufacturer specs warn against using recharables. I've used it for about 6 months, and battery changing has gotten too tedious. After about 10 days, it starts to loose the bluetooth connection.Ergonomics were okay, though if you are using it with a laptop, you might want something smaller.Simply adding a power switch, so one could turn it off at the end of the day, would have a been a great feature."
4,"Yes, it does work with my built in BlueTooth","I bought this mouse because I just got a new HP nc8000 laptop that has built-in Bluetooth. I read all the reviews here - both good and bad - and figured I'd give it a try.Yes, it does work with my built in BlueTooth and it is pretty easy to set up. Note, I did NOT install any of the software that comes with the mouse and (of course) I am NOT using the Bluetooth tranceiver that comes with it either.There were two tricks that you have to do only once:1) Press the ""Connect Channel"" button on the bottom of the mouse right after you choose ""Connect"" off the contect menu in My Bluetooth Places.2) When ""pairing"" the mouse, don't chose a key, just leave it blank.Once I learned this, I was up and running with no further problems."
1,Avoid it at all cost!,"I liked the styling and the promising of this device. I bought one, and it stopped working within 3 days.I took it back to the store and made the mistake of trading it for yet another one exactly like the previous one.It also stopped working.This time, I just took it back and traded it for the wireless intellimouse. This one has worked perfectly."
4,Chicago Confidential,"Pretty good Film Noir.An honest union head,Arthur Blane(Dick Foran)is framed by crime czar Ken Harrison(Douglas Kennedy)for murder.Blane is put away which leaves the mob free to go to town.The DA Jim Fremont(Brian Keith)doesnt believe Blane is guilty and sets up a new investgation.One of the witnesses to the crime is Duggan(Elisha Cook JR)once a high ranking union offical,now a hobo and drunk.See if the Honest DA can come out against all odds."
4,Good One,"I'd have bought this video just for the solos Wynton plays on it. They're more than worth the cost of the tape. The history of the development of early jazz is good stuff, too, though. It's all done through musical examples and is just as good for kids as it is for practicing musicians. Worth your dollar."
1,Psychobabble from a woman who knows nothing,"This book was non sensical to me. If anything it tried to disuade my husband and I from persuing IVF etc. It is bombarded with PC crap and one cannot say "" give a baby up for adoption"" or ""real mom"" she completely sounds pompous and doesn't seem like any advice she would give you would have an ounce of care for the feelings of one going through IF. I think this book was a sham and i regret purchasing something written by someone so high on their credentials but lacking in real life desperation."
2,Didn't find it helpful,"I purchased this book because so many touted it as a 'must read' before considering adoption. I couldn't even finish it because all the book talks about is how to decide if you are ready to give up infertility treatments and switch to adoptions. I'm sure it could be very helpful for many in that situation, but we never even considered infertility treatments. If you are like us and didn't want to try and find/treat infertility medically, this book is a waste of time and money."
5,Lasting Impact,"Sixteen months after our dream of having a family was realized through adoption, this is the one book that I continue to remember, refer to and recommend. The book is sensitive without being emotionally silly; straight-forward and factual without being dry and hopeless. The author does an excellent job of helping couples work through options and issues without being judgemental or overly biased toward adoption as the ultimate answer. My husband and I read this as we started exploring adoption, and we used the suggested process to help sort out our feelings and motivations about adoption. As a result, I believe we were more fully prepared to approach the adoption option in a healthy, positive way."
1,"Great performance, missing a song!",SHAME on Collectibles for reissuing less a song (Who Cares? - 2001 Remastered) so they can fit everything on one CD. Reissue two separate CDs.
2,Not true to orginial music. Sounded off key and distracted.,"Sounded to me like a pickup band from the local musicians union. I know that a lot of the musicians connected with the band were individual stars and performers in their own right. The performance did not follow along from the orginial book. The orginial recordings dating from 1952 were crisp and even when these selections were heard in person they did not deviate from the orginial. I was disappointed that they were not true. The trombone section sounded off key with every one trying to lead. This was a signature of the band and, I am afraid it missed the mark. Now, I know why there was no Ghost Band after his death."
2,This is NOT the Kenton band!,"This is the Kenton Alumni Band and others from a celebration and conference held on May 30 to June 2, 1991. Some of the sounds were not too good, but some good stuff too. The Kenton discipline is certainly not there, but what can you expect."
2,ok,"It looks ok, but it is not as nice looking as in the picture. The ink sometimes leaks out, and makes a mess of things - sign of a cheap pen. The twist factor in it felt somewhat lose at first, now after 4-5 months of using it is really lose, and goes in/out almost with writing an 'a'. I have always been annoyed by rolling ball pens that have ink pile up at the tip so you have to 'wipe' it ,but this one does that from time to time. Relatively expensive nice looking pen that doesn't act like it.Sort of like this: you are used to driving an audi and bought a kia, because it looked almost like the audi and they said it performs just like the audi. well, it does not perform like an audi. it only looks like one on tv :)Money saving tip: save your money until you can buy the audi: Montblanc. The 'maybe just good enough ' is just not good enough. Cheap pens do the same thing and don't cost as much. Did I just say that - yes, I did. So that is the best description of this pen. Overpriced."
5,Works great,Fantastic deal from Amazon! This works as well as the original Kinolta brand I had in my printer before & I paid much less. Lifetime customer here as long as the prices stay reasonable!
1,Refilled Cartridge,"The Konica Minolta cartridge I received from Laser and Copy Supply had been refilled with a cheap brand toner. When I tried to print some labels using it, it acted like glue, pulled a label off and stuck it in my printer. I had to take the printer apart to get the label out. I am still seeing smearing of toner from time to time. The cartridge does work printing text on copy paper.UPDATE: When Laser and Copy Supply found out that the cartridge was refilled, they sent me a message saying they only intend to sell new cartridges, apologized for the mistake, and refunded my money without my asking for it. They even offered to send me a new cartridge free of charge. They intend to please."
3,Cheap and does the job,"Does the job. Nothing fency. To tilt, you have to take it apart, adjust, and put it back together."
5,Eye opening vhs for all portrait artists,"I've owned this vhs for a while; however, now that I'm retired, I have extra time to view it. In any event, it is fabulous video and a real eye opener for me. Did you know that other artists are influenced by other artists and sometimes don't even know they are painting like others? This was new to me. So, it is okay to have your work resemble someone elses. So, when someone says I paint like Frida Kahlo, that's okay. She probably painted by someone else she knew, too! A great investment . . . see for yourself, and no I am not selling my copy yet. Peace, Pam"
4,Good,"Good perspective from the British view, but not what one might call a page turner by any means...."
1,Horrible!,"I thought this book would be unique lists about movies based on facts. However, it's just a compiliation of Mr.McBride's offbeat opinions. He is entitled to his strange thoughts...I just wish I hadn't paid to read them!"
1,Does everything have to be rewritten to be PC,This is not the Chicken Little Story.However we did get a laugh at how a childhood story from the past could be re-written so it has a happy ending and no moral to the story.
2,Mistake-Ridden Index to Weird Tales,"This book lists all of the stories and poetry printed in Weird Tales ordered by issue, author and poet through Summer 1983. It also lists works in Oriental Stories and Magic Carpet Magazines.The authors indicate that ""some minor errors, not affecting the usefulness of the index, have been deliberately made for copyright protection purposes."" I question the ethicality of selling an index with intentional errors inserted into it. I made a detailed comparison of the issue index with the author and poet index and found several hundred discrepancies between these lists including total omissions, different names, different titles, etc. This goes beyond leaving differences to determine if someone is taking the contents illegally. This is a significant lack of quality. If corrected, this would be a valuable reference. As it is, it is seriously flawed. but still worthwhile. However, the errors are not as innocuous as the authors would have you believe."
5,Great Blacks,This ink stick is my standard for judging blacks. Ink sticks come in warm black (vegetable) and cool black (pine soot).
4,Great for short trips,"The Lowepro Slingshot 200 is much better than most shoulder bags. It is pretty secure and allows more movement of the arms. Because of the side opening the camera is pretty easily accessible.I use this pack to hold my Canon 40D with a 28-135mm and the 15mm fisheye. I also keep a point-and-shoot with a small tripod and a waterproof case in the pack. With all that, I still have room for two more lenses.Traveling with the Lowepro Slingshot 200 is OK for short trips. Wearing the pack for long periods can really hurt your back because of the uneven load. The pack can not be worn comfortably on the left shoulder, so you may end up carrying the pack in your hand, or leaving it at the hotel after a few days.Overall, I think it is probably much better than a standard shoulder bag, but possibly a little worse than a regular photo-backpack because of the back pain."
5,A Must Have for Every Photographer,"I love this bag! I carry my Rebel XT with zoom lens attached, my external flash, battery charger, gorilla pod tripod (curled into a ball), all cables and EVEN my camcorder and accessories in this bag... and I still have the outside zippered compartment for my car keys, cell phone, credit card, money and lip gloss! It's never heavy and keeps my equipment safe (and away from my toddler when I'm carrying her too). It also includes a waterproof cover that came in handy last fall on our very wet vacation in Florida. There is a larger version of this backpack but I can't imagine what else I could put in it."
2,Awkward for this Lefty,"Keep in mind here, that I do not, nor have I ever owned this bag. I'm sure it is a great bag, but as a left - handed person it felt very awkward to have the sling going that way. I was all set to buy it after reading reviews online, but if you are a lefty, I would suggest you try one on before you buy it (check at Costco, they had a bunch when I was there recently). I am probably going to buy the Kata KT D-3N1 bag instead because that one can sling either way or you can wear it as a backpack."
5,Lowepro Slingshot 200 All Weather Backpack (Black),"Great camera bag. I had the small one with my Nikon D50 and found I could use more room. When I bought my Nikon D90, I also bought this camera bag. I love the convenience of it being a backpack. Very comfortable and easy to use to get my camera, etc out or put away."
3,"I like it, but...","When I first received this, I thought it would be the answer to my camera bag needs. But after having it for about a month, there are several things that 'bug' me about it. One is that it just doesn't look very good on me - a middle aged female. It's the whole strap-across-the-chest thing, if you see what I mean. Also, I'm pretty quickly outgrowing it, equipment-wise. I've got the D70s, 35mm f/2, 18-55 kit lens, 55-200 kit lens and the zenitar fish-eye. I like a bag I can keep everything in - cords, charger, filters, etc so I can just grab it and go. It's starting to get too small for that. I've ordered the Kata r-103 which should hold all my gear, my 12"" PowerBook and a tripod. Not that I'll always need the laptop, but for carry-on it'll be great."
3,not bad,"this bag is ok. plenty of room for all of your equipment, but if you pack it too full your shoulder starts to hurt. not a great bag if you want to carry around a lot of heavy equipment for an extended amount of time. i ended up getting a backpack-style bag so the weight would be evenly distributed to both shoulders. i like i much better."
4,versatile and holds a lot,"I've had the SlingShot 200AW for 3 years now. It can hold a lot of gear, which means it can get heavy.My most packed setup.In the main compartment:40D with grip and 24-105L mounted70-200/2.8L IS umounted to the left of camera body50/1.4 to the right of the camera bodyIn the top compartment:580EXCanon timer cable releaseIn front small pocket:2 extra camera batteries4 extra AA batteries for flashLenspenMy only complaint, the built-in lens cloth gets worn because the camera body ends up rubbing against it.But I still LOVE this bag!However, having seen photos of the newer SlingShot 202AW, I would say the upper and front pockets of that one is bigger and better. However, not sure if the main compartment is slightly smaller as people have said the 24-105L no longer fits. Also the new position of the lens cloth would hopefully prevent it from being worn by the camera body rubbing against it all the time."
1,Inferior Bag,"I bought this bag several months ago for a trip I'm taking soon. I just now loaded it w/my equipment and I'm pretty disappointed. The storage is equal to smaller less expensive bags, the all weather cover is sewn wrong and has a big hole on one side because of the defect. The clips slide on the straps so I have to frequently readjust them. The balance is also poor, no matter how you load it, you have to set it on its' side. It won't stand upright. For less than half the money you can get much better products. I won't buy this brand again and I would advise others against it as well. The only good thing I can say is that the cushioning is pretty decent."
1,"Awesome design, Poor build quality","Love the design and convenience. The sling design is perfect.The build quality, though, is awful. After a year of intermittent use, one zipper has failed entirely, another zipper is getting hinky, and the buckles are starting to feel weak."
5,Awesome Bag!,"I normally don't write reviews but this bag is the best. I just started off with my new DSLR Pentax K10D and now have about 3 lenses and this bag carries all of them with plenty of room for spare batteries, cords and cleaning accessories. I also don't feel like a shutterbug walking around town with this on my back. What makes this bag great is the fact that you can easily swing it to the front while still attached around your shoulder and easily retrieve the camera for those quick shots. The bag also contains a rain cover, tons of pouches and a great flash memory card holder on the inside of the flap. Basically you can tell LowePro did their homework on this bag and thought of everything. Super well built I give this bag a 10 out of 10. What are you waiting for buy it!!!!"
4,LowPro Slingshot 200,"Overall satisfied with the bag. I wish it had standard book bag style straps, however this works fine after you get used to it. I recomend it to other photographers."
4,Good Mid range bag,"I bought this bag to use when I did not want to cart around my large camera bag. It has a decent amount of space. I carry 2 bodies, 2 lenses, a flash and the other small random stuff I need when I go out to shoot. The easy access is nice, especially when hiking, or shooting sporting events in dodgy weather. I would certainly recommend this bag if you are looking for somehting in between sizes."
4,A good all round bag for day use,"I found this bag to be a great bag to carry a couple of cameras, comfortably. I was a bit hesitant in ordering it, I wanted to be able to carry my Nikon F5, as well as a backup camera, a Nikon D200 (with battery pack) in it. The F5 is a big camera, but fit just fine. I was able to carry the F5 with lens attached, a D200 body and two lenses. The only drawback is the pack has very little space for carrying film. A great bag."
3,Lowepro is so so,"For the price, it's a good find. It holds my Canon 40D plus the 580 EX II flash. I carry three lenses but all are on the small side... 85mm, 10-22 and 17-85. Even if I took those lenses out, I am not sure it would carry the 70-200 or anything larger and that's a downside. It was also difficult to put any of these lenses on the camera and carry it that way. It all fit much more comfortably by the camera body being stored alone with the other lenses, etc.Again, a decent find for the price. Great if you just want to take it out with you on a hike or some sunset pix."
5,Lowepro Slingshot 200,"I purchased the Lowepro Slingshot 200 All weather backpack just before I left for my vacation to New York and it was one of the best decisions I made. We covered a lot of ground and walked to most of our desinations. I have the Nikkon D-60 with two lenses and this backpack was perfect. Light weight, easy access, and plenty of space.Cons: There is no pocket for a bottle water. Keep in mind that there is enough room for the camara and accessories only, and not much for anything else."
5,"Excellent camera bag, but won't carry much else","I bought this for an overseas trip and it worked remarkably well. It's easy to swing from back to front and comfortable to carry around all day. There's plenty of compartment dividers to keep lenses, filters, accessories, etc. secure and separate. The bag is compact so it's easy to maneuver with.The only downside is, once you have all your camera equipment in, there's not much room for anything else. The top triangle compartment can hold a 20-oz pop bottle and maybe a small sandwich or bag of chips. If you need more room you might look at the 300 model."
4,Great size,"This is case is perfect for me. I love that I don't have to remove it to get inside the bag...simply slide it around to the front and I'm good to go. Inside I can easily hold...Olympus E-500 body, 50mm lens, 40-150mm lens, 14-45mm lens, FL-50 flash, all cords, cables, extra cards, my wallet, manuals and there's room to spare."
3,"Good, but could be better","I've used this bag heavily for 2 years and I'd love to find a better bag. Using the sling to pull out my camera without setting down the bag is the primary reason I like it and still use it. But the one strap is not comfortable for long hikes and it is very unflattering on females. As a woman with a normal sized chest, I'm pretty embarrassed to use it if I'm wearing just a t-shirt. It either sits under your chest, pulling up (not a pretty site), or you need to pull the one strap just right so that it flattens your chest (and rubs you the wrong way). So it either makes you look like a dweeb or hurts. Not a great choice. Would *love* the same bag with backpack straps so you could chose to drop one and sling the pack around the front. Looking at either the LowePro Flipside or Tamrac 3548 Express. I think it's interesting that I can find no pictures of the Tamrac Velocity - I'm assuming it has the same problem where chests are involved."
1,"Great idea in principle, but...","I bought the Slingshot 200 thinking that it would be great to carry much of my stuff over my shoulder and be able to pull the bag in front of me for quick and easy access to another lens or a special filter or a replacement battery or media. In practice, I was stuck with carrying that weight on one shoulder even with adjustments with no possibility of relief without taking the right-shoulder pack off and tugging it around with the carry strap. It really is my fault (caveat emptor) for not thinking this purchase through. I'll probably sell it on ebay to someone who has a better right shoulder! I cannot fault the quality of the construction; it is superb. I will replace it with a backpack that allows me to use both shoulders and my hips for support. Does Amazon guaranty satisfaction?"
2,"I really don't like this bag, sorry...","Well, I know everyone seems to love this bag, and I bought it based on those reviews, but I really just don't like it... I got it along with my new Nikon D300 (which I adore!!!), and I mostly work in the field in Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia. The reviews implied that you could wear this and get to the camera quick - a major plus for me; but...... I have a real problem with the design -- if you DO attempt to unzip the bag quick, and grab your equipment, you have to be realllllyyy careful -- the camera will fall out! What the heck? No, I'm not wearing it upside down. It's just a funny design, and I pray I don't lose equipment because of it, but I'll be looking for a different bag ASAP. Sorry, Lowe, this one just didn't work."
2,Almost but not quite,"After reading reviews here I decided to buy the Slingshot 200. Once I got it, it has been repacked and will be shipped back.After reorganized the dividers my Nikon D200 with battery pack- hand grip and 80-200mm lens mounted on the camera fit snugly inside the bag. There was enough room left to squeeze in a 17-55 lens, SB-600 Flash and assorted memory cards and batteries.Quality is pretty good but the zippers seem like they might not hold up under the abuse they'd see with my use. I ride an off road motorcycle to locations where I shoot race photos.The deal breaker for me was after putting the Backpack on loaded with gear it just didn't seem balanced. The swing around unbuckle system seems like a good idea and will work with smaller gear but was uncomfortable to me."
3,Lowepro 200 All Weather Backpack,"This bag serves the purpose for which I purchased it - to corral all my camera gear in one place. That being said, it IS large - but I'm keeping three lenses, a DSLR body, a point and shoot camera, batteries, chargers, cleaning kit and manuals in it. And it all fits, with room to spare.For short jaunts, it is quite comfortable to wear. For longer hikes, it needs to ride close to the body, which makes the process of sliding the case around to get to the camera on top, awkward. When I leave it looser, my mid back starts to ache.The construction quality appears good and seems to offer reasonable protection to the contents."
5,Great Camera Bag for the money!!,Bought this bag for my Nikon d80 + external flash + battery grip. It fits everything pretty snuggly. Other reviews state that the camera juggles around in the bag but I had not experiance that. Very comfortable. I was able to wear it for 8-10 hours straight wandering around Disney World with a little one in tow. No discomfort whatsoever. I love the easy accessibility of the bag...quick access to camera when needed. Rain pouch works great too. I highly recommend this. I agree with other reviewers that the Slingshot 100 would've have definitely a bit small. Glad I went with the bigger size.
4,Loved the 100 then moved to the 200,"I moved to this bag from the 100 version that became just a tad small. This bag is very roomy. I like how I can slide it around to the front to retrieve my camera without ever taking it off my back. I am a lot more likely to take pictures when I can get my camera out fast. Unfortunately, though, I've moved to a similar sling bag that overall I don't like quite as much but has the necessary pouch for my iPad. I'm sure hoping Lowepro makes a new version with a place for the iPad..."
4,Camera Bag,"This bag is cool, it makes moving with the camera a cinch I am always ready for the the shot."
5,Best Bag Yet,"I've just got into photography & I'm running on a tight budget. But this was money well spent. I've used my friends camera's before I got my EOS 60D, along with their bags but nothing beats this for functionality. I must admit that I needed to get used to the slingshot. But once I did it was the best. I live in a tropical country & with the sudden change in weather, the weather proofing does wonders, its not hard to take out nor put back in. Loads of room to carry your accessories that are needed. And morever, it doesn't get in the way of your usual routine so its not like carrying a backpack around. I'd recommend this to anyone.I pack a EOS 60d, 18-135 kit lens, 50mm f/1.8ii, Tamron 18-270mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC PZD & a Tamron SP AF 60mm F/2 Di II LD IF Macro. I know its not much but like i said I just got into it, & I worked hard to save... with help from the wife of course :))Live long & prosper!!"
4,nice,Very good accept it needs a strap or something accross the back of the camera in the storage area to hold it from sliding around or falling out if opening the pack all the way.
5,"A great, but not perfect, camera bag","I bought this bag a few months ago, and so far I'm very pleased with it. To sum it all up, I'll try to list the pros and cons:PROS:* Enough room for my D300, a flash, a wide angle, filters and small accessories, and some food or snacks.* Very fast and easy access to the camera* Allowed as hand luggage on planes. This way you'll protect your camera from rough handling, and you'll have room for a book etc.* Comfortable to carry.* Customizable interior.CONS:* Nice and firm when it's new, but goes a little soft after a while.* Not perfect for all purposes. Too small for some and too large for others. (However, a smaller and a larger bag are available).All in all I'm very happy with this bag."
3,Nice bag,"This is my first DSLR and first ""real"" camera bag so take my thoughts with a grain of salt. Overall, I like it. It's pretty comfortable to wear and easy to rotate around to retrieve your camera. I can fit everything I need in the bag including our camcorder which is great. It's a great way to carry everything I need to capture those special moments.On the flip side, it's hard to put on. Maybe I'm just physically challenged but I just can't get the hang of the thing. It's not something you can just throw over your shoulder on the way out. Speaking of wearing it over your shoulder, you really can't. The strap is at an angle which makes it very difficult to wear over the shoulder. I found it was constantly slipping off. It's either worn the way it was designed or not at all."
5,Awesome Product,Great for the photographer with an itchy trigger finger. Your camera is always a quick zip away. Perfect for the outdoors where you dont want the camera to be in the elements too long yet want to get it out at a moments notice. I love this bag!
3,it's alright,i didn't like they returned the bag without asking me first and i had to repurchased it again to go through the credit card drama
2,Zippers don't last,"I want to start by saying that I really did like this bag for a long time. It was very comfortable. It was quick and easy to get my camera out when I needed it. My only problem is that the zipper blew out on it. The stitches of the right side corner of the ""U"" in the zipper blew out first after a few months, then after about a year the left side corner went as well. Sadly this is not the first time I've seen this happen in this model."
5,Slingshot 200 Worked Well on Alaskan Cruise!,"My Lowepro Slingshot 200 all weather backpack worked very well. I could swing it around and get the gear I needed. I have had headaches from the camera strap around my neck on hikes so I wanted to try a backpack. At age 54 it worked much better. I still had some aches with a long hike, but no headaches. If you carry more gear, this can carry camera, extra lens, flash, small handycam recorder, and all the extra items for using them. I lightened the pack of extras when I knew I would not use all the gear and that helped with the weight."
3,Smaller than I expected...,"The bag although nice was much smaller than I thought based upon the picture. The male model must be a smaller then average person since the bag appears to be of fairly good size. As a comparison; I have used a Lowepro Street and Field Rover backpack for years. The Rover is much bigger and holds more. I'm now on the lookout for a better bag from a different manufacturer. IMO, Lowe Pro really shouldn't advertise their bags as All Weather when you have to put a separate waterproof cover over it to make it All Weather."
4,A good bag,"This is a great day hiking bag. The sling system works as advertised, including the stability strap, while allowing quick access to your camera. It also works as a nice platform for your elbows if you're hand holding. The size is just right, to keep it from being too heavy for one shoulder when fully packed, I think the 300 version would be too big, even with the waist strap. The construction is sturdy, living up to the quality I expect from Lowepro.There are a few small niggles I have with the bag. It distorts some when it's pulled to the front of your body and this can interfere with the zippers running smoothly around the corners of the camera access flap. It's not as easy as I'd like to configure the inside to give access to extra lenses without fully opening the bag. Finally, while it does have Lowepro accessory straps, I wish it had a couple generic attachment straps on the outside for water bottles or a monopod."
5,WHAT A DEAL!!!,"Who ever designed this should get an award! Swing over shoulder. Slide around. Unzip and pull out camera. Top load. Cannot fall out. XT,24-105L 75-300 50mm 430EX charger xtra batt. usb cable and room for more in a small bag [fully padded]! Thank you very much. AMAZON of course!"
5,Camera Backpack,The bag had enough dividers to form pockets for all my accessories. The dividers were adjustable with Velcro adjusters.
4,Wait there is still more to come.,"Artimis Fowl takes a chance in rescuing his father from the Russian Moyfia but knows he cannot do it alone so he makes a deal with LEPrecon, Holly Short. The deal was he helps them defeat the B'wa Kell goblins in return they help him save his father. But what Artimis dosen't know is that Holly Short and himself are becomeing a great team together. The end is very well worded and will keep you on the edge of your seat. It made me wonder if there was a third book. And to my pleasure there was and I read it withen two days like all the others. I know everyone who reads this book will never want to stop. So just be preparred that you will be brought into another world witch you won't want to leave. I still haven't!"
4,Pretty Good Sequel...,"While it can't match the greatness of the first Artemis Fowl book, this is a worthy sequel and kept my interest in reading the rest of this series. Artemis starts his slow change into a character with feelings, based on doing whatever it takes to save his father. This type of character development is key to keeping Artemis Fowl fresh and different from other continuing series."
3,Artemis is not all evil,"The evil boy-genius criminal mastermind is at his evilest at the start of this funny and action-packed story. However, in Artemis' search for his father his heart does warm. A little bit. So does that of his fairy-cop enemy, Holly. A little bit.The Arctic Incidentis the second novel of the Artemis Fowl series which starts withArtemis Fowl, where I have a longer review. The series should be read in order."
4,Artemis Fowl: The Artic Incident,"Artemis Fowl is at it again in this new adveture. Only this time his actions are true. The starts out a year after the battle with the fairies. The news of his father's where abouts are revealed to him when the Russian Mafia sends a e-mail with his father in it. So Artemis gets the help from his rival, Captain Short and Commander Root. Together, they go on a quest to save Artemis's dad and the fairy world as we know it.Artemis Fowl: The Artic Incident is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a great follow up in the Artemis Fowl series. It takes you more in depth about the mystical fairy world. If you liked the Harry Potter series you are bound to read this series."
3,"3.5 stars, if i could select that option","Artemis is at it again, this time he needs the help of the LEP to get his father back, but they too need his help. The book starts off by explaining the whereabouts of Artemis' father, and the plot begins to thicken. The whole gang from both worlds unite in this adventure...and a betrayal occurs which could frame one of the main characters, causing some major drama. This story wasn't quite as good as the first but it was still a very fun read. I continue to want to read more and suggest this book to anyone who enjoys young adult fantasy fiction.I am no longer a young adult but find that i truely enjoy these tales of fantasy. If you have read the first Artemis tale then pick this one up as well, i don't think you will be dissappointed but do keep in mind that it may not be quite a great as the first book was."
4,Artemis Fowl and the Artic Incident,"It wasn't quite as good as the first, but I liked the way Eoin Cofler mixed laughter and action in this book. Every charachter in this book is charming to read about. A real page-turner, I could not put this book down!"
4,artemis fowl is cool.,"i really like this book. it was fast, witty, and comical. although i don't find it as good as the first; Artemis Fowl!, i do highly recommend this book. it is the sequel to artemis fowl and is about mr. fowl and a group of LEPrecon personell teaming up to try and find Mr. fowl's father, and save both the mud man's world and the lower elements. a great read. to short though, i read it in one day."
3,Colfer discovers soap operas,"When I first received this book, I was more then excited. I thought that it would be a book that you could lose yourself into-one that wasn't too serious that the author couldn't make jokes and had a plot that always had a high on the suspense level.To put it lightly, when I finally read it, this wasn't the book I was expecting. It seemed to be hastily written (at least compared to the first book), and was amazingly tedious.Although it truly wasn't so horrible, if you put it next to some of the other books you can find, it was only moderately good. I believe that Eoin Colfer had TRIED to explore more emotional depth in his characters, yet he failed miserably. Three stars for effort!"
4,This book is great but too short.,"Again Eoin Colfer plunges you into the life of 13 year old Artemis Fowl Mud-boy genius and arch enemy of the people, especially Holly Short captain in the LEPrecon force. As always Colfer sweeps you in from the start but the book goes so fast that I felt he could have made it a little longer. I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes to escape for a great romp thru the ever entangling lives of Artemis Fowl and captain Holly Short. This time Aretims's dad is in trouble with the Russian Mafyia and Artemis has to ask the LEP for help in rescuing him. While the rescue team is on route a coupe is happening in Haven that catches captain short, commander root, and even Artemis by surprise. Can they rescue Haven and still have time to rescue Artemis's father? You'll just have to read this one for yourself to find out."
5,An Extremely Good Book,"Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident is the second book in the Artemis Fowl series. If you didn't read the first Artemis Fowl, I highly recommend reading that one before this.Well, in this book the faries are having trouble with goblins. In the meantime, Artemis received an E-mail which suggests that his father is alive. Just as he's getting ready for the rescue attampt, Holly form the LEPrecon squad brings him in for questioning. At last it is agreed that the faries will help Artemis Fowl in his quest to rescue his father from the Russian Mafia, and in return Artemis will help them with their goblin problems.But many things go wrong... I highly suggest reading this book... It's even better than the first!"
5,A SPLENDID VOICE PERFORMANCE,"Following on the heels of his highly successful introduction of young hero Artemis Fowl, Colfer continues with Artemis attending boarding school. It is there that our unflappable hero receives a pleading email from Russia - someone has been kidnaped by the Russian Mafiya and it is imperative that Artemis rescue him. The kidnaped person? His father.There's a hint of the British and a tinge of the Irish in the low, resonant voice of Nathaniel Parker. His reading is superb with perfect nuances and pauses,, drawing listeners into the adventure. I found myself leaning forward, not that I couldn't hear him quite distinctly but because I didn't want to miss one of his captivating inflections.Nathaniel Parker's narration, rather than ""reading"" merits the word ""performance."" It also deserves an award."
5,Better then the first!!,"Eoin Colfer seems to have a great way with stringing together just the right words. He did it again with this amazingly great book that is the sequel to the critically acllaimed Artemis Fowl. This book was even better and I just got lost in the wonderful story and only Lemony Snicket's books and the Harry Potter books have managed to do what Artemis Fowl:The Artic Incident has done for me. This book is really just that good. The fascinating story with fairies and technology and a sinisterly good, good guy make this book in my top 15 or top 10."
5,wonderful book to read while waiting for HP 5,"in short, I loved this book and I would recomend it to anyone who loved the harry potter seres. this book reminds me of a james bond movie and the hightech gadgets they use are really cool!!"
3,the 2nd of the series,"The second book of the Artemis Fowl series, I think, was not as good as the first. There were points when it was really boring, and points that weren't. This one is about Artemis looking for his father. The russian mafiya have kidnapped him, and are looking for a ransome from Artemis Jr. However, Artemis and his bodyguard, Butler, are dragged into a LEP mission. They want to find out who is sending goblins bateries for illegal lazers. This book has its moments, but if you have a book you know is better, go for it."
4,Awesome,"another great installment in the Artemis Fowl Series. Colfer has another hit with this bok.is Artemis becoming less of the little ""demon"" we love so much?"
1,Quite Possibly the Worst Book I've Ever Read...,"""Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident"" is easily the worst book I have read in my entire lifetime. This book is nothing like the first one: there is no plot here. Do not let the back cover mislead you; this book isn't about Artemis searching for his father. In fact, he does little to even look for him until the last chapter. Another plot is introduced about a quarter of the way into the book--a plot Artemis shouldn't even care about. The character of Artemis has changed, too. He is weaker, and has a simpler mind. There are typos, point of view issues, and other mistakes in ""The Arctic Incident."" Quite frankly, I'm surprised Miramax even published this book for Eoin Colfer. Do not waste your time on this book."
2,Harry Potter's Better,"In The Arctic Incident, Artemis fowl is back, and this time instead of a devious scheme to make money, he is on his way to Russia to rescue his beloved father. He is stopped, however, by LEP officer Holly Short who thinks he's responsible for the connection that was found between the vicious goblins and someone above ground.She quickly finds the Artemis is innocent, and they join forces first to rescue the underworld from a new villain, and then to save Artemis's father.I thought the previous Artemis Fowl was a deliciosly dark read. I liked the hero being a villain instead of another snotty hero boy (i.e. Harry Potter).The Arctic Incident however, was a real dissapointment. Artemis was the usual ""good guy"", there were the usual power-crazed bad guy in search for revenge, and Artemis didn't even come up with any spectacular plans. One can always guess what Foaly will do, when the Dwarf will do his thing and so on.A fun read, but a dissapointing sequel."
2,With apologies . . .,"I just finished this one. I'd like to qualify my ""review"" with the following:First: I am not a young reader.Second: I did not read Book 1The writing is wonderful; Colfer can definitely put words together well. The story, however, left me a little bit cold--no arctic pun intended. I'm planning to read the initial volume; I do admire Colfer's style. So maybe take my critique with the proverbial grain of salt."
3,"Fun, but not special","The Arctic Incident is a fun reunion of Artemis, Butler, Holly, Root and the rest, but falls short of the standard set by the first Artemis Fowl book. What's missing is the carefully constructed plot - this time around, it's a fairly straightforward rescue mission in two parts, and the finish won't have you turning back the pages to look for all the pieces of the puzzle that have just fallen together. It's still fun, though - the main characters are all there and all themselves and there's wonder and excitement aplenty."
4,A nice follow up to the first,"This second story takes the relationship between Root, Holly, Butler, and of course Artemis to the next level. They must work together to not only save the fairy underworld, but also Artemis' father.After meeting Artemis in the first novel, you are predisposed to think of him as a villian, as someone you shouldnt trust, but through this novel we find the softer side of him, the more boy like human side of him. There continues to be funny banter between Artemis and Holly, but they grow to respect eachother and work together to save the ones the love.There is plenty of action, a fair bit of humor, and enough interesting things in this imaginary world to keep you reading the book from cover to cover in one sitting.I look forward to the reading the following novel to see where Artemis will take us next."
4,I liked this one better than the first one I think because I,"knew what to expect. They're about a boy named Artemis Fowl who is something of a child-prodigy criminal mastermind. In the first one his goal was to steal some gold from some leprecons, and in this one he teamed up with them to help rescue his father from the Russian mafia. No, I didn't spell leprecon wrong - part of the premise of this book is that LEPrecon actually stands for Lower Elements Patrol reconnaissance - it takes faeries and leprechauns and goblins and things and gives them a new twist, making them into a strong force that lives underground and is very modern and highly evloved. It's kinda interesting, but at first I thought it was cheezy. This one was better because I was more used to the idea."
2,Not Even as Good as The First One,"I really wanted to like this book, but it is not very good. The first ""Artemis Fowl"" book was pretty good, but Mr. Colfer did not have the same luck and/or magic with this effort.It is rushed and, what is worse, plays extensively on the hackneyed device of EVERYONE except our heroes being either bad or stupid. That gets so old, so fast, it makes for an unpleasant read, rather than a story to escape into. I wanted to BE in the world of the first book. I didn't want to be any of the places or with any of the characters in the second one.Definitely wait for the paperback, and perhaps borrow it from the library."
4,The children's Renaissance continues.,"Children's literature was locked in preciousness, safety, and the avoidance of all the tumultuous, stewy reality of humanity for so long that I despaired of it ever coming to life again. Then J.K. Rowling detonated the dam (with books far less exciting than these, in my opinion), and the flood still sweeps me joyfully along. First the Beaudelaire brood and now Artemis Fowl have brought humanity back to the ""children's"" book (and brought back adult readers like me along with them). This book isn't as good as the first: it's the second book in a series, and that's simply inevitable. But it continues the work of the first, slaying cliches and bristling with joy and leading its genre to new heights."
3,didn't do it for me,Colfer could take lessons Robert Stanek on what it takes to create a great world and characters. Artemis Fowl has one thing going for it. That's that Artemis is a criminal boy genius but after 2 books the gimmack is old. The world is yucky. The characters aren't fun. In my heart I wanted to love this.
5,Criminal Mastermind strikes again!,"If you thought the first book was good, this one is even better! Artemis teams up with the LEP to help the them clear up a problem with the humans in exchange for their help in a daring plot to save Artemis's father.It is, if possible, even more clever and funnier than the first, while it also shows a caring and decent side of Artemis that was hidden before, making him more human. Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident combines new characters, like the Russian Mafiya, with returning ones like Holly Short, Root, Mulch Diggums, and of course Butler, in ways they never showed before.The story is about Artemis saving his father, while helping the faries in an underground catastrophy involving the goblins and returning character Cudegon.A book you defianlty don't want to miss!"
5,Artemis Fowl Is Back,"Artemis Fowl is a very good book. Now he's 13, a year older than before. But now, instead of trying to get gold from the LEP(Lower Elements Police), he's trying to get them to help him find his father, who is in northern Russia, or, the Arctic. In order to get them to do this, he has to help them destroy the B'wa Kell, which are goblins. But if you want to see if they succeed or not, you'll have to read the book. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it a 11 and one fourth.The really significant thing about this is it's about pixies, warlock docters, elves, goblins, etc. I think that the most appropriate audiences are 10 years and up. READ THIS BOOK! I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE YOU WILL LIKE IT!"
4,Another great Artemis Fowl book by Eoin Colfer !,"Mr Colfer keep `em coming! Great storyline! Great laugh's! Great action. Great read. I loved it, Artemis Fowl trying to save his father, but caught up in a goblin revolt led by someone from the first book, Captain Short's heroic's, Root and Foaly need I say no more, that big bodyguard Butler, even to put it in Holly's words ""the most gung-ho officer in LEP"" Trouble Kelp and his baby bro Grub plus the return of that ""convict"" dwarf---Mulch Diggums. And an end to drive you crazy for more!The only bad things is that on two or three pages get a bit boring and I think it should have been 100-200 pages longer. Other than that it was great."
3,Prefer The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches,"I found my kids are reading fowl much to my dismay. It isn't literature. You got farting trolls and such (book 1) and fairies and artemis. For the most part it is paper thin characterization and dialog, not much on plot either, BUT my kids do seem to enjoy the stories. AND I've got through 2 of the three books so far. Biggest thing I'm glad about is my kids prefer The Kingdoms and the Elves books which I believe are much better written (though not perfect either) and teach better lessons."
3,getting better,"I don't think that the Artemis Fowl duo (soon to be trio) deserves to be classified as Young Adult. The plot is just too simple and predictable. I thought that YA was classified as ages 12-17, but this should be under juvenile (7-11) I found the characters annoying and too straight forward, and the Artemis: is he evil or not?? thing was rather strained."
4,Easy and fun,"Like the first in the series, it's a good, fun and quick read. I found the internal politics of the fairy world interesting and nicely complex. My only complaint is that this story didn't quite have the same tight pacing as the first."
2,"First book, plus NutraSweet...","OK, now is the time to ask ourselves, what made the first Artemis Fowl book so amazingly incredibly cool? It was cool because Artemis was an evil twisted little boy. He was different from other characters. He didn't follow the tired old ""bad guy turns good in the end"" formula, he was bad and stayed bad. There was no shame in his badness, he was just bad... Which gave the book a very intense effect, and made it daring and interesting.Apparently for this new book, the author HUGELY chickened out. Artemis all of a sudden has ""feelings..."" He does the shy little ""oh, I'm sorry poor little fairy people... sniff sniff..."" thing. Plus he and Holly keep having these MOMENTS. Urg.In short, Artemis Fowl has been turned into another Harry Potter. How depressing."
4,Great read,This book is a great read. It leaves off a little after the second one where Artemis has to help the LEP. It's very exciting.
4,The tricky book,"I liked this book because of the team work between Holly, Root, Butler, and Artemis. What I didn't like was all of the confusing technology. Fortunately at the end of the book, it was easy to sum up the whole story in one sentence.The Commander Cudgeon had turned evil. He wants Root out and himself in as head of LEPrecon. So he works with an evil genius pixie, Opal Koboi, at Koboi Labs. Opal shuts down all LEP weaponry, and blames our centaur friend, Foaly. He's now locked in his control room having tantrums. This is where Artemis comes in. If Artemis helps Holly and Root, then they'll help him save his father from the Russians.I recommend this book to anyone who likes the fairy technology and physics. If you like the cleverness of Artemis Fowl, then the third book is for you. I also have to admit, the plot of this story is great, and Artemis is sometimes even speechless."
5,good book,"The Arctic Incident was in my opinion, a great book to read. I wouldnt advise reading it unless you will read some of it each day, because i took a break and forgot half of it. Its kind of a hard book to understand, but if you like make-believe and fiction like i do, then you will love it."
2,not a good cd,"This Helen Eriksen album is not as good as her previous albums ""Standards"" and ""Love virgin""; this album is quite annoying, there are not many good songs; the melodies of every song are not interesting, and you forget them after listening; this album gives you almost nothing."
2,Old man talks about sea slugs with bad music in background,"For anyone looking for a travel documentary about Bali and Komodo (which I thought this was) don't waste your money on this DVD. It is about 5% good and 95% boring underwater photography narrated by an older gentleman who speaks in a monotone ramble. The background music starts off just fine with some Gamelan music, but it gets horrible later when the bad elevator music with gratuitous guitar solos start. The only thing remotely redeemable about this DVD are some of the sea creatures, like sea slugs that are filmed. In fact this movie should be re-titled ""Old man talks about sea slugs with bad music in background"""
5,Great For Road Warriors! Highly Recommended,"""Shout Wipes"" have more than once saved me for going into meetings with embarrassing food stains from a lunch hastily eaten on the road. I make a point of keeping a few of the packets in my computer case as general precaution since I rarely travel without it.These wipes are great for most food stains, but work best if applied as soon as possible to the affected area.Highly Recommended!"
5,Outstanding product; dreadful service!,"Shout wipes are a fabulous product; and, I wouldn't be without them at work or at home! Howwever, I was stunned to discover that the provider charged the s&h; fee for one small box for each of the 12 boxes ordered, yet bundled them altogether in one saran-wrapped package, weighing only ounces.I'll not be ordering this way again. Sad case of unbridled greed."
1,Not Able to Use This Product,"I was not able to get satisfactory results after five hours of working with the instructions (I have good woodworking credentials). The manufacturer has poor quality control, design, manufacturing, documentation, and packaging. I bought a new router base and guide bushing per specifications but that did not resolve the problems with the tool. I do not recommend this product."
2,Not worth the money,I bought one of these several years ago and was able to make 2 drawers before it broke. The plastic parts don't last and the cams didn't hold the work in place. With the price of wood who wants to take a chance on using this junk and having to buy additional lumber to replace destroyed boards. Go for the Porter Cable instead.
4,Dovetail Jig with Aluminum,"orderd the Dovetail Jig with Aluminum on tuesday feb. 15 2011 and got it today feb.18 2011 very fast to receive it (sooner then they said lol which was estimated: February 22, 2011 - February 28, 2011 )husband likes it have not tried it yet but it looks very nice but will up date after he uses itOh and doesnt look cheaply made."
1,Piece of junk!,"I purchased this jig several years ago with the plastic template. Used it once got frustrated with it and put it on the shelf for several years- wanted to do a jewelry box with dovetail joints. Got it back out spent an inordinate amount of time and trial pieces and couldn't get the ""slop"" out of the joint. So I scrapped the jig and went and got a Porter Cable 4212 like I should have years ago. Out of the box it's 1000% improvement over the Woodstock jig!!!The problem was more than the plastic template one of the two plastic guide for the verticle piece wouldn't tighten or loosen. The horizontal restraining clamp was warped and in general had very poor fit and finish. I used it minimally and the template is severly worn from the bushing. I won't purchase another Woodstock product- no matter how cheap!"
3,Woodstock dovetail jig,"This jig is ok. I had to take the knobs and bolts, that clamp the jig to the top of the board, and replace them. The knob is just pressed over the top of the bolt. I just used a die to cut new threads on the end. Other than those holders being junk this works just fine. If they would of just spent a few bucks more to get better knobs this would of been great right out of the box and I would of given it a 5 star rating."
2,Poor Quality,"This is a poor quality jig. I had to file a washers so that they would lay flat. I am an experienced woodworker and this unit does not belong in my shop. Setup is fairly easy. You will need a place to permanently mount. The jig setting guide is NOT accurate. I even calipered my wood to be sure of measuring accuracy. IF I purchase another dovetail jig, I will definitely purchase another brand. The company would not honor the warranty, but Amazon was kind enough to accept a return. I lost about $10, but was willing to do that to get it out of my shop."
5,Great Tool for all woodworkers,This is a good piece of equipment--using it for dovetailing drawers and fine pieces of furniture. The instruction manual is a bit hard to follow because it is not laid out logically for use.
2,do not purchase: not worth the time or money.,"the product is a waste of time and money. delivery was almost two weeks. when the items arrived, they were not assembled. no hardware was included. the price to obtain all of the proper additional hardware is 200$ (and up)."
3,Missed opportunity indeed,"Actually, THREE tracks on the CD release of America were edited in order to fit the material, so if 4 Men with Beards used the CD master for the LP, the versions of ""Dalhart Texas 1967"" is shy a few seconds, ""Mark 1:15"" is 3 minutes, 27 seconds shorter than the original, and ""Voice of the Turtle"" has had 15 seconds shaved off. Definitely a missed opportunity. Why the folks reissuing these things don't avail themselves of the expertise of folks at <[...]>, some of whom have been involved in a number of superb Fahey reissues, is beyond me."
2,Techless & Stoned,"OK, I know John Fahey is a father and originator of finger-style picking.......and influencer of many. But whats going on here?In spite of all the worldwide appreciation for John Fahey, I have to say that the playing on this album is so lacking in technical execution and interesting composition, that im amazed it was released to the public. Im even more amazed that sophisticated audiences of today, can endorse this as ""great guitar playing"".Im a beginner student on acoustic guitar finger-style, and I think that even my own doodlings are more interesting....If you want to hear history, buy this album, if you want great guitar playing....run like hell fire and dont look back.For roots guitar picking thats good, I reccomend; John Renbourne, Bert Jansch, Dave Evans, Davey Graham, Leo Kottke..."
3,"Vinyl re-issue also uses abridged ""Mark 1:15""","What a thrill to find out that 4 Men with Beards was putting out a deluxe edition of the full 2-LP album, as Fahey originally intended. Even better is that record one has all the tracks that didn't make the original album, so that record 2 is essentially a document of the original release. Almost! Fantasy sent 4 Men with Beards their new remastered tapes which include the SHORTER, CUT version of ""Mark 1:15."" This is not only sad, it's frustrating, since space is with the vinyl release not an issue. There is room to include the full ""Mark 1:15,"" but it's not here.Still a nice release, with original art and great sound on 180 gram vinyl. But this was a major missed opportunity!"
2,Have the right screw driver,I had a nice Phillips screw driver for this but one of the screws just would notbudge. You need to loosen two screws to get battery in place. Finally had to break it open to get inside. Very disappointed with the unfriendly way of replacing the battery
4,This will deter an attacker,"Based on the sound level, no one will want to be on the same block if pulling the pin becomes necessary. Great way to feel secure. My wife loves it."
3,"good build quality, volume was way to low, closer to 100db","good build quality, volume was way to low, closer to 100 db. nice connection options. bought this for prepping situations. will keep looking for louder unit"
2,Read this at the library,"I enjoyed the first book, but by the fourth book I was not willing to spend the money to complete the series. This five book series should have been done in 3 books at the most. It takes a very good author to make a series longer than two or three books, unfortunately this is not the case. One of the things that turned me off on this series was that amount of ships, planes, equipment being used up during these battles started to be so enormous that it was difficult to believe that these loses would not have effected each side's ability to continue. In short read this at the library before you spend your money."
5,Dragon's Fury Reading Furiously,"Usually I like to read heavy, light, heavy, light, which generally means fact, fiction, fact, fiction. But this author has me in a bind.I finished volume I and am a little way into Ann Coulter's Slander, all the while Dragon's Fury volume II sits waiting, breathing, on my shelf. But not only does this reading order break my rules and feelings well-being in that a spoonful of sugar (light fiction) helps the medicine go down. Though I love Ann Coulter and her book, I can't stop thinking about Jeff Head's Volume II.Voume I is so awesome I have no doubt Volume II will capture anyone who enjoyed the first. However, if you react like I did, you'll be ruined for reading anything else until the Dragon's Fury is behind you."
2,Reunion disappoints,"Not sure why they got back together as it seems like an exercise in rehashing what was once a good band but ran out of ideas. A few great tracks (Middle Of Midnight, Away From Home, Cheatin' Kind Of Love) but too much formula. However if fills a space in the on-going history of country rock"
4,shotgun site,This product attaches to the barrel of your gun easy and it helps you to locate your front site in a hurry. Good product would buy again.
4,"Pepper stretches out on 1977 set from Half-Moon Bay, CA","Baritone sax master Pepper Adams really gets to stretch out on this live set recorded at Half Moon Bay, CA in September 1977. His quartet performed five tunes, four of which clock close to ten minutes or more. Pianist John Marabuto comps supportively behind him, and solos satisfyingly as well. Bassist Bob Maize and drummer Ron Marabuto also provide competent support, with Maize taking an affecting melodic solo on the slow ballad ""Body and Soul"". The audio quality is acceptable for a live recording of this vintage. This CD provides a good showcase of an often under-rated major talent."
5,I loved this book!,I really loved this book. Delgado's writing is so vivid and clear that you really feel like you are there! Everyone should read this.
4,Norse by Nortwest,"The Norsemen may have been the first to attempt this passage but they were certainly not the last. Over 300 years of trials and bitter, freezing failures were to come and go before Norwegian Roald Amundsen finally conquered the passage in the early 20th century. It is not a coincidence that the only other undiscovered lands and the last of the remaining great adventures was also in a snowy, bitter climate - Shackleton's voyage to the Antarctic on the 'Endurance' was taking place at about the same time.Disimilar to other 'popular history' books, this one does not have the same easy, flowing, narrative style but what it does differently and better than other pop histories is give details. Here you learn all that you could possibly want to know about every unfortunate mission that unsuccessfully sought the Nortwest passage. Crammed with maps, photos and illustrations it's all here. The little sidebar descriptions - mini biographies- of many of the explorers is a nice feature."
1,Not much meat,"Basically this is typical value investing with a small cap bent, though he will buy value at any price. Chapter two covers this and the rest of the book will put you to sleep. He's long winded, add small type and over 350 pages... it was a struggle to finish.Much of it could have been left out. 50 pages are a review and comments of past years portfolios. Another chapter is on his pet peeves, one on funds, one defending use margin and one on Tech analysis (he doesn't use it for individual issues, but he looks at a few general market indicators to guage risk and overbought levels in the market). Except for a chapter 9 analysis of Ford, there isn't much about selection besides chapter 2.His returns were made using full margin. His best contibution it to say don't be too rigid on the numbers, be flexible. Usually stocks will be undervalued on a couple measures but not all of them. I'd recommend any other book on value investing."
1,impulse buy,"I bought this book on the advice of a clerk inHolden Beach, NC, and I should have saved the money.If all you want is sex scenes, buy it, but if youwant plot and character development, forget it.The mystery was thin, and the romance wasn't there........"
1,wanted to like this,I really wanted to like this book especially since I just returned from a trip to Sunset Beach but it was impossible. I found one of the main characters totally obnoxious while the other was a mixed up mess. I also thought all the sec scenes were unnecessary. Maybe they had to be there because the plot was so sligjt
5,Great features...even talks!,"I just got this printer today after having an HP for a few years. Set-up was a breeze! (I have win98) I was very impressed with this printer. I'm a college student so I could not afford the pricey printers, but I wanted to print picures. The pics come out awesome! It has a lot of great features, which I was surprised at. I love the on-screen ink indicator, which you can even customize!! The printer even talks to you(not much just says that printing is starting or complete-but still a cool option). Also, when you go into print-properties, an ""I Want To"" list comes up, click on what you want to print and it walks you through everything. It also has auto printer head alignment and a feature that eliminates paper jams. A GREAT PRINTER!!"
5,The special sound of brass,"Disclosure: I was an engineer for this album. Honest opinon: it is great. Its is easy for one's ears to get too used to string music, what with guitars, violins, and pianos so dominant. The timbres and sonorities of brass are refreshing. These tunes were recorded in the living room of the founder of MAMA records, the late great Gene Czerwinski. We struggled to get the right ambience, but the musicians surely didn't struggle for the beautiful notes. The ""book,"" i.e. charts, is superb. Highlights: well, I can't even pick. Little Sunflower maybe? Love them all!"
2,Disappointing craftsmanship,"Let me compliment these earrings first: the gems are quite beautiful - definitely fire opals despite being created stones. The gems have a rich depth of color and the gold complements the stones well. My problem with these earrings is that of workmanship. The first (and only) time I tried to wear these, one of the posts broke off. I pulled (gently) the back off the post to put them on and the post snapped off at the earring. I haven't been able to wear them at all. I wanted to return these but can't because I have misplaced the receipt. Other items on Amazon can be returned from the order online, but this isn't one of them. I've had good luck with SilverSpeck before but in this case I was disappointed."
2,Not as good as it seems,"This video shows you 20 minutes of basics but it spends more time trying to sell you things then training you. Look for the weekend painter, much better."
4,McGivern's Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting,"After several months, I am still reading this book--it has a lot of detail and so it's kind of a slow read, but I still find it very interesting. There's practical information there as well as a whole bunch of now rather useless details which are mostly interesting from a historical standpoint. Mind you, I just like to shoot, and this is only my opinion about something I'm fascinated with. It's not for everybody....but,personally, I'd say, if you want to be well informed regarding the matter of revolver shooting, this is a book to put in your library and read."
4,The Best Book on Improving Revolver Pistol Accuracy,"This is a must book for anyone who wants to shoot a pistol. Although it is seriously aimed at revolver shooters, many of the techniques covered in this book apply to semi-automatic pistols also. There is a lot of material to wade through to get to the points, but it is well worth it.Some people may get frustrated because the author is mainly covering 38 caliber ammunition. Just remember the principals are the same. If you start out with 22 caliber and move up, it is actually easier to gain control and learn the lessons, so when you do move up to higher calibers, you already understand the principles. The important part is to gain the accuracy and be proficient.The book is reasonably priced and 22 caliber ammunition is cheap. So have some fun and learn how to shoot that side arm of yours. You want to make sure you hit what your aiming at."
5,revolver book,"Its written by Ed McGivern, What more can you say. If you like shooting, Buy it! Read it!"
5,Nothing New,"Ed McGivern's book ""Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting"" is the book you're looking for if you want to learn to shoot. Ed McGivern was amazing, and I believe he still has records that are unbeaten. You'll see the ""Taylor Speed Rock"", the ""Ayoob Wedge"", and other tactics since named by egomaniacs who would lead you to beleive they invented them, this book was written in the late 1920s prior to most of these guys being born."
3,Boring,"I want to say up front that I am a gun guy from way back, and a revolver man through and through. I have heard so many good things about this book that I could not wait to get it, but it is pretty boring to me. Of course, the material is dated, but McGivern's writing leaves something to be desired too. Very technical, and dry. I respect him tremendously for what he did, and for conducting these experiments with the revolver, but the book is boring no matter how you sugarcoat it!"
4,Cat'z that get slept on!,"I've been involved with several music projects on different levels C-Justice(C),Redman(Red),Buddah Monk,P.J.Porter etc. and thruoghtout all these lyrical experiences I've notice that only some of these Artists get the proper recognition that I feel they have earned,my point is that this is yet another one of those so greatly appreciated underground ""acts"" that are just finally receiving the recognition for there upcoming, everyone gets there chance and J.V has definately Rep. Hip-Hopto the fullest. -A/1"
4,ApproachinG....,"this is rough around the edges, sure....but there are some real worthy gems on here. this disc is worth the price for ""Thief"", ""Little Star of Bethlehem"", and the remarkable ""Pnoom."" certainly not a good starting point for those curious about CAN. but a great little footnote in their history."
2,Just OK,"I was very disappointed in this book. There are a lot better ones out there; Vanderpoel is excellent; I would say, don't waste your money on this one!"
5,Excellent and Rare,"This is a truly excllent monograpraph with some intriguing photographs and commentary not available before this account. This is a beautiful treatment of what happened to the almost mystical and undeniably lunaticical cadre of villains responsible for one of America's most horrifying and haunting domestic events. Like everything else that this dark chapter in US history provokes, these pictures catapult the reader back onto the streets of Washington D.C. where you stand as witness to this shocking tale."
5,One of the best picture books ever about these events,"Daniel Weinberg is a gentleman and a scholar, as well as the proprietor of the Abraham Lincoln Bookshop in Chicago. His great talent for acquiring and interpreting artifacts of the Lincoln era shines in this book, which includes some of the best-ever images ever published of the conspirators who helped John Wilkes Booth plan an attempted kidnapping of President Lincoln, and, later, assisted Booth in aspects of his murder plot in April 1865. Weinberg and his fellow historian (James Swanson, who contributes a masterful text, setting the pictures in context) provide a richly illustrated historical tapestry in this generously made coffeetable book. If you want to know what life was like after their arrest for David Herold, Sam Arnold, Samuel Mudd, Lewis Powell and their cohorts, you need look no further than this extraordinary volume. Any Lincoln library that does not include this book lacks an essential new cornerstone."
2,More phtos than words,"I was disappointed in this volume because I was expecting more of a narrative, that is a sequel to MANHUNT which documents the pursuit of John Wilkes Booth andDavid Herold from Washington to the Garrett Farm in Virginia. This volume is primarily a set of photos and pencil drawings of the trial and execution of the four convicted conspirators. There is only a limited amount of historical research. Nevertheless the volume does include a drawing of my cousin's (George Adam Herold's) house near the Navy Yard in Anacostia which I had never seen before."
5,serious history for all time,"this is a great book and for all lincoln assassination scholars or those who just want to read riveting history.this book is fully illustrated with truly interesting photos. these illustrations really bring it all together with the narrative. as i read it,i can't but help feeling that history was a little unkind to some of the ""conspirators"". for example,poor george atzerodt,was called ""villainous"" due to his scruffy appearance. this was a sign of the times during the 19th century to judge someone like this but,as the book explains there was a definite ""hysteria"" after the death of lincoln. it is understandable as this was the first death of a president this way.i do highly recommend this book for anyone who likes this subject. it gives a new meaning to ""full understanding"". a great work!"
5,Great addition,A great addition to my Lincoln collection. Wonderful pictures and historical artifacts. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Lincoln assassination.
3,Not much Bible here,"The author's unique clues and style makes the puzzles a comfortable challenge. The answers cannot easily be found in the Million Word Crossword Dictionary. However, I am deeply disappointed at the lack of Bible-related clues. The only thing Bible about the puzzles is a brief quotation in each puzzle. If you're looking for crosswords to exercise your Bible knowledge, this book will do little."
5,Inspirational and digestible,"Smilor has captured not only the practical intuition of entrepreneurship - but its vital inspiring essence. His organization is coherent and bite-sized; perfect for a quick pick up, a fast scan, or a page-turning read. He obviously understands the needs of the fast-paced digester, leaving the reader with both solid academic/research/theoretical underpinnings as well as real-life stories of entrepreneurial inspiration. A terrific book for anyone running, growing or starting a new venture!"
2,"Cool Minigame, bad main game","This game pretty much stunk and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the cool ""monkey fight"" minigame. The other mini games were okay. However, the main game was terrible. It was extremely frustrating and stupid."
1,A waste of time,"Do not buy this game ever. it's so stupid. If you had a 3 year old son or brother or sister even they would pass it without breaking a sweat. Rather buy Tony hawk 4, mario advance 3, denki blocks or even snoopy tennis for GBC. I hope that this review will be helpfull. Remember DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
5,stunning!,"Does this live up to the fun of the gamecube version?Well,I honestly don't no for I have not played the gamecube version.But if it doesn't the gamecube version would have to be like an entirerly new definition of fun!This game is visually stunning,and offers great challenge and replay value!The main game starts easy with beginners mode,then works up to advance mode and the incredible hard expert and master's mode!While the later stages are so extremly hard the extras make up for it!each time you earn 2500 play points you can pick one of 3 mini games to unlock!The mini games are monkey fight,monkey bowling,and monkey golf!After those are unlocked you can get extra continues and an extra golf course!So when the difficulty gets on your nerves you can play one of these always fun mini games!Overall this is one of gameboy's best!"
4,The Most Fun Game I've Played on my Gameboy Advance SP,"Super Monkey Ball Jr. is the best game I've ever played. It took me a few tries to unlock Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, and Monkey Fight. When you unlock all the mini games, it gets to be a lot of fun because that's when the action really starts. My favorite mini game is Monkey Fight because it's kind of like boxing. In Monkey Fight, there is a big boxing glove to help you knock other fighters off the ring. Monkey bowling is also lots of fun because you try to knock the pins down. I would give this game five stars."
1,not so great at all,"I am sorry but, this is a horible gamefor this series. It has bassicly no mini games, low graphics, horrible levals, NO PLOT OR STORY AT ALL!!!!, and the levalsstink, if you want to play super monkey ball get super monkey ball deluxe!!!!!!!! it rocks!"
4,Super Monkey Ball JR.,"Super Monkey Ball Jr. is a great game. If this is your first time playing, I recommend you to play the beginner levels, and not just jump ahead to the expert levels. When you get to level 5, 10 and so on make sure you get all the bananas so you have lots of points. Forget about the time and just take your time to finish the goal. If you get 2,500 points you can unlock a mini game. Even though this game is hard to control, it is still a great game."
4,Great traveling extension --------,My kids and husband LOVE this game on the GameCube. I bought this for our cruise. My kids love this game almost as much as the other one. Insanely fun and funny game..........
2,"A Lot of Hype, A Lot of Headache","All my son wanted for Christmas was this thing. I was so excited to find it and be able to get it for him. In the comercials, it shows these balls flying over the arena bouncing into each other and knocking one of them out. In reality, the fan is not strong enough to propel the balls high enough to actually create this type of duel. We have tried putting two balls in with no weapons and they still don't float above the areana piece.It is loud, the pieces don't work properly and I'm exceedingly disappointed."
4,So Fun!!!,We actually bought this game for my nephew and my 10 year old saw it and decided to spend some chistmas money on getting one. It is really fun and all the family enjoys it. We actually lucked out and Toys R Us had a big set with the sound attachment for 15 dollars. I like the sound attachment and suggest getting it as well. Must remember to adjust the wind throttle.
5,A Must,"If you're looking for a guide to help you survive the guerilla warfare of the corporate world, look no further. This book has all the tactical tools you need to handle anything thrown your way."
5,Leadership Handbook,"I long ago gave up reading ""management"" books. What a waste of time. They were either unreadable business psychobabble or simplistic Dr. Seuss clones (with none of his wisdom). Feiner's book is set of practical instructions on how to survive/succeed in the business world. You should really buy this book for yourself, but even if you don't, buy copies for your boss, your subordinates and your peers. It will make your working life so much more fulfilling."
2,"Too long, and too weird","The actual writing in this book is fairly good, where it has a chance. However, in addition to being much too long and drawn out, the actual story is rather uninspired and pedestrian. Also, significant portions of the book take place inside the computer system, in a sort of V.R. construct. However, the descriptions of the action taking place there are largely meaningless, being concrete descriptions of abstract concepts. The same is true of the scenes of the Ell ""bindings,"" which were full of meaningless, albeit poetic, descriptions of telepathic communication.There are a host of other faults in the storytelling, which I don't care to get into, but suffice it to say that this book is simply not worth the time it takes to read it."
5,A masterpiece made even better,"The original Psycho-Cybernetics had a massive impact on my life. From it, I learned that I could control my thoughts and substitute encouraging, strengthening, creativity-enhancing thinking habits (""programming"") for the less than optimal habits I'd picked up from family, friends, school, work, society etc. HOW you think makes ALL the difference and there has never been a book that clarifies the mechanisms of productive thinking better than Psycho-Cybernetics. This new edition is, amazingly enough, even better than the original. It's clearer, easier to follow, and even more compelling. I'll always be grateful to the person who recommended this to me when I was 20 years old. Twenty two years later, I'm living a life most people only dream of. I owe it all to my outlook and this book was where I began to make the connection between outlook and happiness and results in life. Essential reading."
2,Loved the original not this!,"I simply loved the original psycho-cybernetics, but this version and also the one by bobbe sommer are cheap imitations. Although this version contains most of the material as the original it is laced with useless fluff and story after story by kennedy that makes this a much longer boring read. The original was shorter and to the point, easier to understand, a pleasure to read. I wish they would print a hardcover anniversary edition of the original, it is MUCH better. Why tamper with perfection as they say!"
5,Change Your Self-Image Change Your Life!,"I consider this book to be extremely valuable for anyone who wants more from their life, business or career. The concepts shared in this book have helped me considerably in my professional and personal life. I've shared the ideas within my workshops with great success. I think it is a must have for any serious self-growth library."
4,4 Daily principles,1. Forgive others completely everyday. 2. Forgive yourself completely everyday. 3. See yourself at your best. 4. Care for yourself Everyday.
3,The Same,"Psycho-Cybernetics was a very enlighting book for me in the 70's. I had lost my copy so I ordered another and at the same time the New Psycho-Cybernetics was about to come out so I ordered it also. Wish I had known that they are both the same except The New Psycho-Cybernetics has a little extra so I could have just ordered the new book. This is a book for beginners, way behind other books on the subject of thinking to change your life. Information long and drawn out that is not needed."
1,Stay with the original,"I think you really have to question the liberties Mr. Kennedy has taken with Maltz's original material and words. He has ""updated"" and ""edited"" trying to modernize the material, but it ends up leaving a convoluted mess of the message. The original by Maltz is dated, but easier to read and absorb."
5,Great Book!,"Although written for the pastor, this book has great ideas and pointers for any speaker. It also has a little humorous twist which I like a lot."
3,The Challenges of growing up!,"Another local writer does it again!!!!! Tonie Short's book ""The Gifted Child; John's Saga"" tells the story of young John. It goes goes through all of his trials and suffering as a child growing up in the 70's . Reading this book you are taken on an adventure from birth, to losing his father, to his school years. Granted it took me a second to get into it, (afterall i wasn't born til 7 years later), I actually realized all generations of children/students go through a lot of what John went through. I'm thinking it will be a sequal to John's life. It kinda left you haning, wondering ""Did he succed in life?"", ""Did he fail in life?"" ""What did he do after school?"" Overall it was a good read.Thank You Tonie for sharing!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I HAVE JUST ORDERED A FEW GREEN DAY DVDS AND HAVE JUST WATCHED THE DVD COMBO FROM SWEET CHILDREN TO AMERICAN IDIOTS AND GREEN DAY MUSIC IN REVIEW THE ARE THEY SAME DVD DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THE SECOND DVD IS A CRITICAL REVIEW OF AMERICAN IDIOT WHICH I ALREADY HAVE. FEEL RIPPED OFF. THEY HAVE JUST PACKAGED THEM DIFFERENTLY.
3,Cross pendant,Looked alot more substantial in the photo. It is a nice delicate item sale price was good but would be expensive if full price.
4,Outstanding vocalese from Marilyn Maye,"Two 1960s-produced albums from songbird Marilyn Mae are available on CD so that everyone can now enjoy this radiant voice. Maye confounds listeners with her style, sounding at times like the full-throated brassiness of Eyde Gorme or the smokey-hued vocals of a latter-day Liza. She offers up a spirited Take Five, the Dave Brubeck hit, a romance-filled Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars, and does a Louis Armstrong imitation on the overdone showstopper Helly Dolly, but she makes it listenable. There are other super song selections on this album, including David Shire's Washington Square delivered with the sparest of backings. Maye is still performing and these albums show why that is."
3,"EMPOWERING, BUT THE MESSAGE ISN'T NEW","I like Dr. Anthony's message and have bought several of his books now. I, too, feel that following his principles of belief -- true belief in oneself -- can transform your life. I would recommend this book -- and all of his books -- for anyone who wants to change the direction of their life. Still, what Dr. Anthony says in this book isn't much different from what he writes in the others. (He could have used an editor at times, too.) Lastly, Dr. Anthony seems to owe Ralph Waldo Emerson at least a brief acknowledgement; he's obviously been influenced by Emerson's writings -- unless, of course, Dr. Anthony plucked these ideas from the ""Universal Mind."""
5,Great principles for success,This book is an easy read to pick up & re-read even when you only have little bits of time to spend on it. Great principles!
5,"""True Skool Hip-Hop at it's best!""","This is one of the best, if not the best ""Old-Skool"" Hip-Hop compilations to date! It contains classics from T-Ski Valley, Cold Crush Bros. and Nice n' Nasty 3 (1st time ever on CD!!!) Re-mastered superior sound and super rare, hard to find tracks from the the years '79-'82. An incredible collection, a must have for the true Hip-Hop head!!!"
3,See it for Lamarr/Henreid combo,"After allegedly missing out on playing Ilsa in Casablanca, Hedy Lamarr was cast in this wartime resistance tale. Surrounded by many of the same cast including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, you would think the story would be stronger. Unfortunately the plot is a little weak and the film is more of a vehicle for Paul Henreid. If you are a fan of either Lamarr or Henreid you will want to see it, but set your expectations a little low and you will probably enjoy seeing them together as much as the film itself. Lamarr is at the peak of her glamour and Henreid gets to be the hero and not the ""other man"" like in Casablanca. There are some good scenes including a jailbreak and shootout, but for the most part it is not more than an okay film."
2,A Casablanca wannabe,"This is a film made 2 years after Casablanca, with much of the same cast, minus Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Paul Henreid is a saboteur escaping from the Nazis via Portugal.The movie is in the original black and white, which is fine, the picture quality is good. What isn't good is the sound. There are no subtitles and at points it is almost impossible to understand everything Henreid, with his tight lips is saying. Much of the other dialogue is soft and muted then the background/mood music is loud and alarms, sirens and gunshots are earsplitting.It's difficult to appreciate a movie when the dialogue is as vague as the plot."
1,No Customer Service,The software itself is only okay. Their customer service and technical support are nonexistent. I purchased this software about two years ago and it worked fine until recently. Numerous attempts to contact them for assistance went unanswered. All those hours spent inputting information for nothing!*#@.
2,Poor customer support,"Although the software is pretty good, they have very poor customer support, sometimes taking weeks to respond. At times I've had to send multiple emails before getting a reply.Other than that the software is pretty good, it includes a database of US, Canadian and a couple of other countries, complete with prices in several grades."
5,AWWWEEESOMMM!,Amazon is so cool....and Kane Roberts is Totally awesome!He has his own guitar riffs---I can't wait until his next album kicks up!Totally Unique!!!
4,Heavy Metal Titan....Rocks Out!!!!,Kane Roberts debut albums rocks hard and is alot edgier than the later pop metal album. Great heavy metal album. Alice Cooper and Kip Winger appear.
3,good... but could have been better,"Honestly I was expecting more from the sequal to White Lion's Lady. I am not used to romance novels in which the female lead is a traitorous murderer. The ending was well done and was pleasing to read, but the first 90% of the book was about secrets and lies, and the female lead was not very likeable."
4,"Fantastic, of course","I am convinced that everything LA writes is fantastic. Great story, great characters, always great writing. I will continue to read every single item she publishes! Favorite author ever."
3,Not what I expected,"After reading the reviews I was expecting something else, something 'more'... I really can't put into words what I didn't like about this book but I didn't enjoy it, I got bored quite a lot while reading it and I couldn't see the love story between the characters progress, just their lust for each other, which could have been fine, but not even the supposedly hot scenes worked well in my opinion.Still I'm giving it a 3 stars rating because it was well written and I can understand that some readers could find this story of their liking, it just didn't work out for me."
4,Captivating! 4.5 (four stars and a half),"Tina St. John distinguishes herself as a leader in the Romance Novel writing industry. The story, Black Lion's Bride, had many spins and turns woven into it and I found that this is not in the least a predictable book as much for romance novels go.If you want to be swept away right along with the characters of the story, I encourage you to read Black Lion's Bride."
4,Great Read BUT ....,"This was another great book by Tina St. John. I loved Sebastian from the White Lion book and wanted so much to see him find the love of his life, which he does, only I don't think I would have been so forgiving.I had a major problem with Zahirah, the female assassin and Sebastian's love. There were just too many things she did that I personally could not and would not be able to overlook - but perhaps that is just 'my problem'. Otherwise, this is an exciting story, very fast read with no dull moments in between.The sex was hot and luscious. I loved seeing the references and contact with 'Blackheart' who is the hero from Lady of Valor. Really a super well-written story that I have come to expect from St. John now that I have read all her books. I look forward to her next offerings."
1,Plodding,"Having enjoyed White Lion's Lady so much, I thought I would love this book, but it was like torture. The sentences were long, drawn-out, you had to read them several times to make sense out of some of them, the vocabulary and style were often wrong, her verbs were all over the place--the editor obviously did not look at some of this, and we romance readers really deserve better.the autor admits herself it took her over two years to crank the thing out. Crank it did.I never warmed to any of the characters except Logan the scot, and he was not supposed to be the hero! the stereotypes and the impetuous and not very pleasant nature of the heroine's real identity make this one a book to be missed."
5,neglected country blues artist deserves recognition,James Talley came out with this album in the early 70s. At the time he was fairly well known in the south but he never seemed to hit it big time. Too bad because he has a wonderful soulful voice and gorgeous songs. He deserves to be rediscovered.
5,A Gem,"Simply put, this is a really good book. Lolly Winston works the Kubler-Ross stages of grief into the well developed and likeable main character of Sophie. I found myself enjoying Good Grief far more than I thought I would; the packaging is very chick lit and doesn't really suit the novel, but frankly that is all that I could find wrong with it. The story moves along at a rapid pace and Sophie's self-inspection is superb. She doesn't ever get over her loss, she just learns how to deal with it, and that is what we can all only hope for after losing a loved one.I look forward to reading more from this very talented writer."
5,This book has it all!,"This book touched my heart and made me first cry and then laugh as it went through several stages of grief as the main character, Sophie tried to cope with the death of her husband. Told in the first person, Sophie was unflinchingly honest in her observations about herself and the people around her. Sophie was unable to pretend that she was coping as she went through a nervous breakdown and completely ""lost it"". Her struggles to make painful decisions and major changes in her new life without her husband made me want to cheer her on. By the time I finished the book, I felt I had made a new friend. Excellent book and a lot of fun to read!"
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed this book. You really fall for the main charecter. I felt so much like her. Her thoughts felt like so many of mine. This book is about a woman in her early thirties and her husband has just died. She has a complete nervous breakdown but is able to pick her self up and move on with her life. It is a good read.
5,Lolly Can Write!,"""Good Grief"" is a book rich with all of the textures, emotions, ups and downs of life, with a healthy dash of sarcasism and humor. Winston's tale is heartwarming, while reading it I laughed, cried and took visits to similar situations down Memory Lane. I have been heartily recommending this book to everyone. Great pace--good read, especially for the beach!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I expected to love this book because everyone gives it glowing reviews. But I was hugely disappointed. It started slow and had annoying writerly flourishes. I only got into it in the last 50 pages, which did end up making it worth my time. But I nearly gave up on it a few times because it dragged on at first. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except maybe a grieving widow. Life's too short to read mediocre books."
4,Goods read,"Well written, both entertaining and insightful. The only real issue I had with this book was the author's tying up things very neatly with a shallow, sappy ending of sorts. Not that I wasn't cheering for the character(s) to find happiness, but given the wonderful level of the author's writing talent, and her ability to develop characters, coming up with essentially sit-com resolutions wasn't really necessary to make the story work. That's the only way this novel fails in what is otherwise a wonderful rendering of a fictional reality that rings of truth. Bravo Lolly Winston."
4,"Sad, But Riveting","From page 1 , I could not put this book down. Thought the first half is crazy depressing (see the chapter when Sophie has a nervous breakdown culminating in her dismissal from work), she soon realizes changes need to made and the story becomes more interesting. Pretty realistic, I think, as Sophie eats her way through her grief, and is not easy to trust after losing her husband. Still a soft touch though, Sophie has love to give. Loved her success as the books ends, with her relationships and career. Hopeful."
3,Good Grief,"The first 1/3 of the book was depressing, which is natural for the death of a husband. Unbelieveable details like going to work in her slipper and robe. After that, the plot picked up and became an enjoyable read."
4,Great book,"For anyone who has lost a spouse, this is just lovely........makes you see that everyone grieves and in a different way. This made me cry, laugh and just plain chuckle. I have passed it to others to enjoy."
5,Sure to be a Best Seller,"I LOATH the term ""Chick Lit"" because I'm afraid it's being used as a pejorative. Instead, I'll call ""Good Grief"" an ""extrodinary work of contemporary literature that happens to have a female protagonist""!""Good Grief"" is a delight from start to finish and with luck, Ms. Lolly has a lot more where this came from. Brava!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"Good Grief is an excellant book, which I have read at least five times. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are feeling a bit down. It doesn't matter if you cannot directly relate the main character's loss of her husband, because whatever you are going through, this will surely help cheer you up. I always feel optomistic when I finish reading this book, because you see the process in which the main character climbs out of her pit of sadness. It reminds me that nothing is too unbearable to deal with, even if it seems so at first.This book is an easy and fast read. Plus it came out in paperback, so it doesn't cost too much money to purchase. I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes a great story."
2,Yet again...,"I get so excited when I see a book where the main character has the flaws we can all relate to. She's an emotional wreck, struggles with her weight, her frizzy hair, her overwhelming thankless job. But - and here be the spoilers!! - I get so disgusted when, time and time again, these characters make an impossible transition, discovering some amazing talent they never knew they had. From being an incompetent waitress to a fabulous pastry chef, from the frizzy hair to the silky ringlets, finding the perfect man who's hopelessly in love with her, and transforming a cutting arsonist into a well-rounded teenager. All this and so much more - within a year. It's not even believable."
3,"Well written, but incredibly annoying main character","The book is extremely well-written, but it took me a while to plow through it simply because I found the main character so incredibly inept and annoying. Sure, her husband died so, at the beginning, I started to read with sympathy. But when she not only had a complete breakdown but then continued to be wimpy, inenpt, letting everyone trample all over her, without putting up much of a fight I got bored.I would have enjoyed the book more if I felt that she had eventually gotten some 'cojones' and taken more control of her life instead of just drifting along, letting everyone else dictate it for her.I would probably read more of Ms. Winston's books as she is an excellent writer, but would be more careful about reading through more of the book before buying it simply because I would be wary about yet another wimpy character."
3,"Satisfying, Neatly Done Tear-Jerker","This book is a real tear-jerker. We meet the main character just as she's about to hit rock bottom after the death of her husband. Have you ever wished you could avoid someone who is going through a rough time? Not wanted to go to a funeral or to the hospital to visit or listen to them, because it is so uncomfortable and brings your worst fears to the surface? This book takes you to that same place.But even despair exhausts itself, so it's only a matter of time before the grief-ridden main character begins to pull herself together. She moves, she finds a job, she discovers a talent for baking and turns that into a business, she becomes a Big Sister, she finds a lover. By the end, everything is back on course.This makes for a very happy and ultimately satisfying read. The writing is honest and the emotions seem raw and true. You really want everything to turn out well, and mostly, it does.If you like tear-jerkers, but want a happy ending, this is a good choice."
2,Life at the Speed of Light,"The opening chapters of Good Grief had me laughing to myself as Sophie Stanton, our protagoniste, tried getting through life after her husband's death. Touching and humorous, I held high hopes for the ensuing 200 pages.However, this proved to be a typical chick lit offering--tragedy, followed by meeting various zany characters, culminating in Sophie's life being wrapped up in shiny paper and tied in a tidy bow. Not only does she accomplish everything she never knew she wanted to do, she does it all in one year. Yes, roughly 365 days after her beloved husband's death she has the total 'new life' package.If you want a sticky sweet toss-away, go ahead and buy it. The author's ability to generate chuckles in the opening chapters earned it two stars. Otherwise, I would have had to demote it to one!"
3,"I enjoyed this story,","I enjoyed this book. I thought it was good but not great. Still, I recommend it for a light and easy afternoon read as you sit in your front porch swing sipping on an ice-cold lemonade. It will put a few smiles on your face."
5,Fabulous book,"I can't remember when I've enjoyed a first novel as much as I enjoyed this book. This is such a heartfelt, heartwarming, wonderful story and Sophie is such an endearing heroine. Actually, all the characters in this book were wonderful, from Crystal to Marion to Ruth to Drew to Jasper to Chef. I especially loved the relationship between Sophie and Crystal. It developed in a way that seemed very real to me. In fact, everything in the book seemed real to me. As someone else said, I never felt manipulated, yet I deeply felt Sophie's grief and bewilderment and rejoiced with her when she began to pull herself out of her depression and back into the world. Lolly Winston is an extremely talented writer and I'll be waiting eagerly for her next book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,A good read....but,"There are some genuinely funny moments in this book, but at other times the humor seems forced or even silly. And as another reviewer said, sometimes the author can't seem to resist the urge to wrap things up too neatly and so the ending in particular feels pat and predictable. It just feels like the book is trying too hard. Two others I would recommend on the subject of grief..._PS, I Love You_ by Cecelia Ahearn, which is also sometimes predictable but has good characters and doesn't wrap things up so neatly, and _Alison's Automotive Repair Manual_ by Brad Barkley, which tells a very funny, moving tale about a young widow trying to restore a car in a small town...it's hilarious, sad, heartfelt, and never ever predictable. All in all, I would recommend _Good Grief_ but with strong reservations. Maybe 2.5 stars."
4,Good Grief=Good Read,"Good Grief is the perfect book to take with you to the beach this summer. Why? Because it's well-written chick lit with a twist chick lit that will actually make you smile, and sometimes even laugh out loud. Sophie Stanton, the charming narrator of this novel is 36 and recently widowed. Let me warn you, the first several chapters of this novel, while well-written and gently humorous, are sort of a downer--Sophie is pretty much miserable and her life is falling apart. My advice: try to read them in one sitting and get to the more middle parts of the novel, where she starts to get her act together. You can breeze through this novel in a couple of hours. Sophie is a wonderful character--likeable, you'll want to root for her. A fun, light read."
5,Great fun!,I loved this book. I have read it a couple of times and I always enjoy the author's sense of humor. Definitely fun to read.
3,Good Grief,"I found this book hard to get into at first, I almost put it down after the first couple of chapters. It did get better though. I did read it and it was okay, not the best but okay.Maybe if you lost a husband you would enjoy this a lot more."
4,"in the process, but really enjoying it","i'm still reading the book, but i'm really liking it. it's the story of a young woman who has just lost her husband to cancer and is dealing with her grief, but in the most unusual ways. she does things that aren't ""textbook"" for widows, which tends to bother some people, but pretty much confuses her and makes for a good read. so far, i'd recommend it to the person that likes to read about real emotion mixed with comedy."
3,Good if you start on page 166...,"There's a reason people grieve alone. No matter how tragic or well-written, grief in and of itself does not make for novel or interesting subject matter, and characters so mired in grief they're helpless aren't any better. In her immediate mourning for her dead husband, Sophie was irritatingly self-pitying and her sarcastic running commentary jarring. While a different structure (one that introduced interesting, active Sophie to the reader much sooner) would have fantastically improved this novel, once Sophie hit the road for Ashland, her world became a place I wanted to spend time and she and her friends people I wanted to know and care about. Toss out the first 160 pages or so and you have a promising first attempt by a new writer."
3,good but not great,"This book is a very honest look at grief and being human. Sophie (the main character) goes from eating an entire package of Oreos from sadness to opening her own business while working through the classic (and not so classic) stages of grief. I liked the book because it was very realistic and true. Everyone can relate to at least some part of it and Sophie. But parts drag a bit, characters are stereotypical, and the ending is good but rushed.Like most reviewers, I'll agree that it's a good book but not great."
3,Summer reading,"I recently was struggling over the loss of a long time boyfriend. A friend said that I was acting a little bit ""widowed"" and recommended this book. It is very good in describing the overwhelming depths of grief, however I stopped caring about the story about 3/4 into the book.I would recommend it anyway, it is great summer reading for alongside the pool or as a night reading companion for short trips."
3,fun book,"It was a nice light read, both funny and sad, but the ending was a little un-realistic and a little disappointing... I still would recommend it for a beach read!"
2,It's good to be a widow,"I started this book hoping for a little depth, some insight into a young widow coping with the untimely death of her husband. Sure some humor and hope are a good thing, but this is so trite and unrealisistic I wouldn't have finished it if not for it being a book group selection. Sophie Stanton tells us she's grieving her husband (and we must believe her-I mean she goes to work in her bathrobe!). However, she seems fairly happy and things seem pretty good for her. She moves to a new town, discovers a previously unknown talent with which she starts her own very successful business, rehabilitates a troubled teen, and has an incredibly good looking and kind man fall in love with her. And all within a year of her husband dying. Gosh, it's good to be a widow!"
5,You'll laugh (yes!) and cry,"I never thought it was possible to laugh while reading about grief, but Lolly Winston has accomplished that in her debut novel. She made me laugh, cry, and just marvel at all the emotions Sophie went through shortly after losing her young husband. There were a few times where her grief was so raw, then she would do or think something off-the-wall. It just really shows how the mind is having a bit of a tug-of-war when everything is so unsettled. This certainly was a story of new beginnings and it was filled with a great sense of hope. Okay, so there was an element of cheesiness with the addition of a romantic interest (saw that one coming a mile away), but Lolly's writing is skillfull and very fresh. I highly recommend this book!"
4,It makes you feel normal!,"This book exposes the reader to so much-- from the unthinkable of being a young widow to the everyday embarrasing mistakes we all make. It is a celebration of life, death and survival. All very simply expressed. It will make you laugh and cry and, at the end, you won't regret a single minute!"
1,"Not good, not good at all!","I wanted to like this book, I really wanted to. But, I didn't! The characters were interesting as was the story but towards the end of the book the tale just gets wacky and super unbelievable. It was sort of like when your favorite TV show runs out of creative direction so they add a new baby or adopt an orphan.It was an interesting story that could have been so good but the bottomline is that is just got lame with all the fighting in the bakery!!!"
5,A MASTERPIECE,"This book opened up a whole world to me, and introduced me to so many wonderful women, but it's only now, a month after reading it, that I feel compelled to write. The book has stayed with me. Lines from it keep coming back, and stories flow through my mind. It probably makes no sense to call a movie book a masterpiece, but if it does make sense, this one qualifies. I don't know how men feel about the book -- I wouldn't presume to speak for them -- but women who care about their history -- and young women who are looking for examples from the past to steer them into the future -- would do well to buy this book and read it twice. I loved it."
5,WHERE HAS THIS BOOK BEEN ALL MY LIFE!,"Ladies and gentleman, this is the book. Before the forces of oppression, repression and hatred-of-all-self-expression took control of movies, there was a little period of time, this camelot-like period where freedom reigned. COMPLICATED WOMEN tells the story of that period and the women who made it amazing -- and those ladies are still relevant to us today. I mean, they're not just still good today, still entertaining. The movies they made are still relevant; they have things to say to us. Those movies are wilder than anything out there NOW. I also liked the pictures in this book. They're about 50 or so, and they're lovely."
2,I kept waiting for it to get better . . .,"This book held my interest to a point, but I was truly disappointed. One reviewer said the author was obsessed with Norma Shearer. I found him to be obsessed with Greta Garbo. If I had to read one more passage about Garbo's indescribable beauty I would have thrown the book at the wall. I love all the films of the thirties,and Shearer was a favorite, but I found this book tedious. It did not deliver for me. Sex and power in pre-code Hollywood and not one thing about Shearer's marriage to Thalberg? I found this to be a let down. Pass on this one and save your money!"
2,Disappointing,"This book is so boring. ""Complicated Women"" revolves heavily around Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo, but I found the 'secondary' actresses more interesting (their stories are sprinkled throughout the book and probably only make up about 4 pages total): Jean Harlow, Barbara Stanwyck, Ginger Rogers, Joan Crawford. Since lesser recognized actresses were referenced too, I hoped that there would be pictures of everyone LaSalle mentioned. When I finally reached the photos, they were grainy and looked as if they were printed with a low ink cartridge. I was curious about Mick LaSalle's other book regarding men in Pre-Code Hollywood, but I'll probably skip it altogether."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a HUGE disappointment. The author has some kind of strange obession with Norma Shearer. He makes numerous idiot statments. He refers to all of the other major movie stars (such as Clara Bow, Jean Harlow, Myna Loy) as just minor background players...umm NOOO. This man obviously knows very little about cinema. I kept waiting and waiting throughout the book for him to stop talking and praising Norma Shearer, but he never did. Yes, Norma Shearer was a good actress but she was not God's gift to earth, so stop with the worshipping. Unless you are a die heart Shearer fan, DO NOT buy this book, you will be disappointed."
1,Not very deep,This book is ok if you are looking for descriptions of the plots of movies--especially Norma Shearer's. If you want anything more thoughtful--look elsewhere. The author's understanding of the code and its impact on women's roles in movies is very superficial.
1,Johnny One Note,"Mr. LaSalle is a zealot, not a scholar, and it shows. His obsession with Norma Shearer clouds everything he writes. He perceives that Shearer has been unfairly neglected in film history, and his attempt to redress this takes priority over any thoughtful examination of women in Pre-Code Hollywood. The plot synopses he offers are no better than anything on IMDB, his arguments on quality are poorly supported, his writing is clunky and full of redundancies, and his insights are dubious."
2,Can't Compare With Original Twisted Metals,"This game is really awful compared to the first two games of the Twisted Metal franchise. When 989 took over making the TM series, it really went downhill. While this game is slightly better than TM3 (mainly because of more weapons and better courses), it still suffers from cruddy car choices and cruddy driving."
5,Best of the Series,"Twisted Metal 4 is awesome. You can even play as the boss cars if you can find the codes. (Hint: If you play a saved tournament, then quit, go to Deathmatch, and there will be a lot of hidden arenas.) Have fun!"
5,twited metal 4,"ok i have all of the twisted metal games and 4 is by far the best.it has sweet graphics and the new cars are sweet.the levels are the coolest.there is a bedrom,oilrig,amazonia 3000bc,and much more.this is also the bast series play station has 2 offer."
3,It was alright,"I have to admit ever since 989 took over this series has gone downhill,especially with 3 but 4 is a improvement from the last one and has some cool characters.The maps are ok in this one, and 4 is a challage to beat."
4,Solid Car Combat Game,"I am the proud owner of Twisted Metal's 1-4. I can honestly say this series is the best car combat series ever made. While TM 1-2 were slightly different from 3 and 4 because of the developers, 4 still provides the adrenaline rush that reminds me of the good old days. Sweet Tooth is still around of course, this time not a playable character, but as the 'Wishmaster"" and final boss. The graphics are alright, but lack in the multiplayer department. The soundtrack is good, and the option to play as Rob Zombie is very humorous. For any Tm fan I urge you to pick this up. If you're not willing to take the risk of bad graphics and a new developer, wait for Twister Metal Black. This new PS2 game promises to be the best car combat game ever, and take the TM series to a new dimension. This game though is very much enjoyable."
4,An addictive game; not for young children,"This game is basically a demolition derby with toy cars that have different features and weapons.Ok, I love this game and the soundtrack. I would not let young children play it however because the soundtrack has some swearing in it and even one of the characters is a transvestite (Drag Queen).If you're an adult, this game is highly entertaining. The soundtrack has the likes of Rob Zombie, Cirrus, Cyprus Hill and Skold. I honestly didn't like this kind of music until I played the game.The graphics are very realistic and it reminds me of what it would be like if people drove toy cars. Sometimes the graphics get really slow; like when there is a lot of action happening at once. There is an option that you can turn off some features so that you will have smoother flowing action...Over all this game is a hit with me and my friends."
3,Twisted Metal 4 isn't all it used to be...,"TWISTED METAL 4...such a game makes me sad.First of all,the game has nice graphics and sound effects,and the levels look really cool.Still,several factors totally ruin this TM game.#1-Gameplay.Your missiles and bombs do very little damage,and miss lots.#2-Car Design.Who wants DRAG QUEEN,for crying out loud!?!#3-Controls are itchy and twichy."
3,BUY TWISTED METAL 2 INSTEAD!,"I am a fan of Car Combat games and I was very mad when I got my hands on TM3. It was a complete waste of money. So I hoped that 989 would do alot of work to improve TM4. I was wrong. TM4 still has bad control and the characters aren't that great, however you can use Rob Zombie. All of the original characters are slowly dissappearing.If you are looking for a fun car combat game try to find a copy of TM2. Or you could also try Vigilante 8 or Vigilante 8: 2nd Offence."
1,Horrible,Twisted Metal 1: goodTwisted Metal 2: greatTwisted Metal 3: goodTwisted Metal 4: badAs a fan of the series I couldn't stand this game for more than 10 minutes.
5,hi,"hi the reason i gave the game 0 stars is cuz,i dont have it yet i just saw the screen shot's and by the looks of it this game look's awsome! I saw it on a page in a k.b toy's magazine that my aunt was reading and i told her thats what i wanted cuz i saw the ad for it on tv and it looked awsome,any way do u know what this game is like? It's like starwars:demolition wich is another awsome ps game it's just like that cuz in demoltion u go around hunting your enemy's in a big arena and u fight em,well any way i cant wait till xmas and see if she bought it,seeya till then.p.s by the way that creat car look's awsome!"
2,"Same old, but with horrible camera angles.","The Twisted Metal franchise was at it's best as far as innovation in the orignial Twisted Metal. TM2 added larger arena areas, but was considered to be not as good as the original. TM3 was horrid. TM4 is more of the same. I have played this game and found the camera angles to be irritating and the control unpredicable. The ability of your car to accidentally drive up a straight wall is laughable, unless you actually bought the game. For the best car combat game out there, pick up last season's Vigilante 8. There is a reason why most video game reviewers compare all car combat games to it. It was innovative and had good control and a unique system which allowed players to tell which weapons the other players had on board. Don't buy TM4 for your kid. And by all means, don't trust what the people here are saying. We sure aren't experts."
2,989 just can't get it right...,"Yuck! This game is NOT fun at all. All new cars, except they are all very l***. They still don't understand that bigger levels are not better! Some levels are so huge, that it takes 7 hours just to Finnish everyone off, plus they are ultra boring (The Maze is just plain miserable), atleast TM3 had some fun levels. Plus there is a ton of ""wall driving"". And the car movement is not as fun as any of the past 3 TMs. Avoid, unless your a HUGE TM fan!"
1,DON'T BUY,"As a owner of Twisted Metal 1 and 2, this was a big disapointment. I thought they would have learned their mistakes from the last one. Ever since 989 studios took over this game on the third one, this game has lacked the fun and excitement that Singletrack brought to the first two. This game is very boring at times because they made the levels so big that you go minutes without finding an enemy."
5,A wonderful dvd with great performances from every artist,"This dvd rocks. I was so sad when i couldn't go to the festival but now I am able to experience the festival on my big screen tv at home. The performances rock with highlights definetely coming from Phil Lesh and Bob Weir, Widespread Panic, Trey Anastasio, and String Cheese. Other performances include Les Claypool, Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, Norah Jones, Bela Fleck...etc. This dvd has amazing sound and amazing video quality as well and really puts you in the middle of the action. I would definetely recommend this to anyone who loves ""jam band"" music as much as I do or just loves music that makes them feel great and makes them want to get up and groove to the tunes. A wonderful buy....hope you all enjoy."
4,Awesome!,"This DVD is as close to being there as you can get! I was over joyed to see that they had included the Bernie Brains song Number Two. They are one of the best bands that I have evr seen, Buckethead and Claypool are just magic on stage with each other. Too any one who was at the Festival get this DVD! Too any one who wasn't but wanted to be, get this DVD! And to everyone else get this DVD! I highly recommend this show to anyone who has a DVD player it is most definitely worth the money! PS Bernie fans keep an eye out they are supposed to be performing a few more times and those perfomances are going to be professionally recorded audio and visual so until then, The Masked Psycho Shall Masquerade Among Us!"
4,Great Variety!,"I enjoyed seeing the variety, and thought that the level of musician was very, very good. It was a fun mix."
2,Too! slow with shipping. I don't understand why it's not shipped yet.,why hann't you shipped it yet. you only ship once a month or somthing. will not order from this person again.
1,crap,"this dvd is good if you like to watch crap on a television. buy newer dvd, its 10 times better. unless you like to wacth alot of crap."
3,Chapter 1 is superb!,"I bought this book because of scanning through chapter 1. This is my usual method for deciding if a particular book might likely be something I would enjoy. This time, however, my method failed me. Chapter 1 was superb. The subsequent chapters were just *okay.*Chapter 1 introduces Cymel, an 8-year old who lives on a farm with her dad. Her experience of the sights, smells, & activities on that farm are so vivid that I felt like I was there. I immediately liked Cymel and her dad, & was eager to follow the fascinating plot threads that were introduced in her chapter.Sadly, however, the chapter ended & the book started introducing new characters, new locales, & new plot lines, etc etc, in rapid fire fashion. I soon got rather confused. Worse yet, Cymel seemed to have been relegated to a minor role, & I neither liked nor disliked any of the several new characters sufficiently to get me past the sixth chapter."
3,It does what it's supposed to do.,"Well, it does what it was designed to do. I have three problems with it, however.1.I agree with the other reviewer, that the threads really should have been acme.2.The handle is too small for comfort, both in length (I feel like I am twirling my finger when using it), and too narrow in diameter (not comfortable).3.The last complaint is also about the handle. It is too close to the front jaw, I keep banging my knuckles when tightening it.I think it is designed to last and it will probably be around much longer than I am. It just would have been nice if ergonomics were considered in the design."
3,Works but sucks,Its OK....but just OK....And the reason is that the screw is not an acme thread but is just a normal....wont call it fine thread....but it appears to me to be just an ordinary threaded rod.I would not have purchased the product had I known this. It really doesnt affect the clamping ability of the vise but it does affect the speed of opening and closing the vise which can be a pain when working on different sized stock. Having to make 10-15 turns of the handle instead of 3-4 just makes it aggravating.
1,damaged,Unfortunately this item arrived damage. The graphic on the tin was fun and looked nice with the exception of it arriving bent.
3,It was okay,This was a nice addition for my collection of Romanov books. I wish there had been more written about Mr. Gibbs experiences with the children of Nicholas and Alexandra as so little is known about them.
3,"Repetitive, Obscure, but Raises Interesting Issues","Read this for a seminar on Freedom and Responsibility. For those with a legal background, it presents little NEW material. The thesis is that the law's treatment of luck, risks, and responsibility (and everything else) stems from a concern about protecting the fair terms of interaction between persons. This focus tends to reject a legal subjectivist account of the law that centers on the subject's motives or beliefs in favor of looking at which actions a ""reasonable person"" would take to be fair in terms of the security and liberty risks of persons. While not quite offering a fresh perspective on legal analysis, the work does bring up many of the interesting issues and problem areas in the law."
4,Surprisingly interesting for a non-specialist.,"I gave this book to my father -- a World War II Merchant Mariner, who came under frequent U-boat attack. But I read it first, and was amazed at the range and depth of the material. I learned more about submarine -- and anti-submarine -- warfare from this book than I ever had in 25 years as a naval officer! And, I must say, I enjoyed the journey. Captain Kathleen Kelley, USNR"
4,"A bit uneven, but good.","Well, this is pretty much stripped-down acoustic Tempest, still a good thing if you like Lief Sorbye's voice. A couple of the songs didn't do much for me. I expected to like ""Jeg Lagde Meg Sa Silde"" more than I did, and ""Bold John Barleycorn"" isn't quite up to the standard that other recordings of the tune have set. On the other hand, ""Beeswing"" is very poignant, and ""What Put The Blood"" - a wholly vocal track - is powerful. Recommended."
4,a quick history of serbia,"This is a really quick read. It only took me about 3 horus to finish. Great book though. My only complaint is that it was obviously written quite a while ago. Its free, so who cares, download it!"
4,Simple to use,This book is set out so it easy to find what you want to know. Alos it seems to cover most of the areas and what to do and plan
4,"Good Airplane Reading, short on substance","For some earlier, for some later, for some never, but for a lot of business people as we cross 50 years in age, we start to get eternally minded. I saw the book title and thought, wow, I would like to read this. I would like to be sure my espoused beliefs and work life are in as much alignment as possible.It is a fast read and easy, doesn't challenge you very much. This is what I consider optimal airplane reading.However, it left me hungry for more. It is basically a series of short stories, but trying to be a good Christian ( or I would think Good Jew, or Good Muslim ) in business is very hard. In the way, the book disappoints, I was entertained, even touched by some of the stories and I believe stories can change behavior. However, I don't think I can honestly say I learned any more about what I can do differently or better.Glad I read it, don't plan to keep it on my shelves"
1,Blech,"While he seems to have done at least a little research, the author seemed more interested in venting personal differences and stating narrow-minded opinions than in writing a good book.I was hoping to actually learn something useful.Or at least interesting.I didn't."
5,One of the Best Books about music,"I had a guy at Barnes and Noble clue me into this book. One of the best books about the underground/alternative/whatever music from the late `70 up til grunge hit the airwaves. Sure, there's a lot of bands that could've been in there and a few I could argue that shouldn't; but that ought not to matter. There's some great biographies of bands that I've always wanted a relative outsider to tackle, meaning he doesn't pander to his readers and pull any punches with his subject matter. This book captures an overall attitude that was very prevalent in those times, at least as I remember it. An attitude sorely lacking in a lot of music today."
5,Great book on an important topic,"The story of the bands profiled in this book will inspire even the most jaded music fan. Besides how important these bands were to the whole ""alternative"" music scene, their stories will make you believe that there are still bands that really care about their music, their fans, and real artistic integrity. I only wish there were other books that covered the era of American indie / college rock. At least this book does a great job with the topic. By the way, I heard Michael Azerrad being interviewed about this book. The interviewer asked him how he was able to get so many notoriously private people to open up and talk about their careers. His answer was that nobody ever bothered to ask."
3,Insightful...but get your politics elsewhere,"This book is a fantastic look into the minds and music of a select group of musicians whose impact is really beginning to be felt now if you ask me...However, one thing I've always found boring, hypocritical and worthless about the hardcore punk/Straight Edge scene is the politics it espoused. The whole ""Reagan is the enemy"" bit has never made sense to me, because every musician and writer from that era ranted about that, but I've never ever seen one thing any of them can name to prove it. You want a good, fair dissection of punk politics go see SLC Punk - that's an eye opener, and the author and bands interviewed in this movie should also see it for the reality check contained therein (yes that means you Fugazi, Anti-Flag and Zach from Rage Against the Machine)"
4,Good for Bands you are not that familiar with.,"Well written but for a few of the bands I was familiar with it was not that interesting.For the bands I didn't know much about, there was something to learn."
2,Is this book accurate?,"I picked up this book specifically because there is a chapter devoted to one of my favorite bands, Big Black. As I read the section devoted to Big Black, I was upset to find several mistakes regarding song lyrics and titles. The first was when lyrics to the song ""Deep Six"" are attributed to the song/title track ""Racer X."" The second mistake was the song ""Grinder"" is referred to as ""Grind."" This left me wondering how well-researched and accurate this book really is. If such simple things as double-checking lyrics and song titles slipped under the radar, what else has?"
2,"Great Subject, Not So Great Book","The birth of the indie rock movement is a very complex and commendable undertaking for the subject of a book, and for that I thank Michael Azerrad. But I was thoroughly disappointed, chapter after chapter by Azarrad's formulaic writing style and abundance of opportunities missed for deeper exploration of narrative threads other than a simple timeline.Broken up into chapters about specific bands, i was expecting (as the title infers) to get a glimpse into each band's life at a point in time. But rather than stepping inside that ""scene"", we are firmly planted outside, with Azarrad, as he drolly pans his ""one size fits all"" lens from one band to the next.I felt guilty reading this. Like i was reading a tabloid or a bio produced for an NSYNC fan club.Save your money and buy the music he's writing about instead. This is important music history, someone will do it justice soon."
3,"An OK read, but missing vital components","I just finished reading most of this book. I skipped two of the bands, as I just wasn't interested in finding out about them. Although the scenes certainly were interesting, and as a fan of many of these bands growing up, I just didn't find the excitement in Azerrad's writing, which tends toward the dry side. I also recall in a few places, where Azerrad uses a combination of words, which he then repeats in the next chapter. This was just an annoying quirk of the book.The big crime here is the omission on a chapter on the Melvins, who have influenced many of the bands participating in the indie scene of the 1990's. Given the author's Nirvana obsession, coupled with the obvious influence the Melvins had on Cobain, and with the Melvins' way in which they have run their career, it seems like there should have been more than just a passing mention."
5,Something for everyone.....,"As a decendent of Irish-Catholics I found this book enlightening. Never realized the strife entailed in the course of religious freedom in the 1830's and 1840's Ireland and never realized that one could be exiled to America or Australia for infractions against the Protestant landlords.This book has it all, history, mystery, love, sorrow and intrigue. Also brings the challange of keeping ones christian faith in difficult times. Good book for Catholic and Protestant to read.Can not wait to read the next book in the series."
3,I bought this as a present for my mother,"I got it as a mother's day present. My mother loves it, but she'd love anything I gave her, even if it turned her finger green. My mom never takes it off, except when taking showers or washing the dishes. It seemed to wear a bit but it still looks nice. You can tell that it's not the best quality though."
3,Looking for quality,"An important book for students or all people who apreciate Coca-Cola advertising history. But the print quality of this book is very bad and the rason I gave only 3 stars rate. I have many others books about Coca-Cola and comparing some pictures on this book I can see a serious problem of quality of picture reproduction. The magenta canal, the black canal at the scannering time is not correctly adjusted. The reproduction of originals have primary errors! I hope this review sound like a special attention adivise for the editors. Don't do that please!"
2,Need seller to get back to me,"Hi, i bought an audio-technica Pro8HECW mini cardioid condeser headset for uni pack system! But i hardly used and been taken great care, but it already has some unconsistence noises! My voice keep breaking down every time i tried to use it, i wonder if i can either return or get a new one from REMSTORE! i tried to email and contact the seller more than 3 times, but never heard from the seller. I really need to be contacted and tell me what i can do or what you can do to help me solve the problem. Thanks!"
1,Includes Homeopathy,I'm looking for legitimate natural healing. Not bs about the vibrations of water that once had the medicine I need in it...Anybody who can recommend homeopathy with a straight face is giving a bad name to alternative medicine.
3,References ?,I lecture on nutrition wellness and holistic medicine. Gary's book is of use to me however it would be of more use if the facts in the book were referenced to peer reviewed studies. There are no references substantuating what he says in the book. There are also not many references to side effects or contraindications. Overall its not a bad book. I just wish it was more referenced.
4,Good Memories,"This was an eye opening book for me when I first read it way back in the day. I saw it listed and I am happywith the book, which arrived in excellent condition and most of all on time!"
3,Not the best episode,"I think the challenges were a little stupid this time. The Stig never came on, he is the most important part of the show."
2,Uk > US,"Its a decent time killer, but if you liked the UK version, you probably wont like this. Its as goofy, but somehow seems... forced. You can feel the script and predict what will happen."
2,Not uk,"It's okay but if you like the UK version, skip this. It will let you down. It has all the goofy things, but they feel forced and overly scripted. There is less actual car content, not that you should be looking towards this show for all your information always.So let's not compare this to the UK version. It's watchable and passes the time fine. I'll continue to watch the seasons as a time waster."
1,Not even close to the UK Top Gear,"I would not waste your money or even your time (if your a Prime customer). If you have been watching the original UK Top Gear, the American version will upset you. I can't even think of one thing better, maybe except that it creating some US Jobs but I would rather see Donald Trump fire everyone. Just my opinion. Also note that some of my friends that who never watched the UK version, do think this show is OK, until I show them the UK version of course."
3,Mario Lanza For the First Time/ML Sings Caruso Favorites,"I have always been a fan of Mario Lanza'a and his singing ""For The First Time"" is wonderful even tho' it is an old sound.It arrived promptly and in excellent condition and I will still love hearing him sing."
2,Not a kosher cookbook!,"I bought this cookbook thinking I would get a bunch of kosher recipes I could use that had a Southern twist. I couldn't have been wronger. The cookbook has a lot of recipes that mix milk with meat and use non kosher ingredients.So, if you keep kosher, don't buy this book."
5,Great Intro to DnB,"FaithMassive's Bass & Drum for the Masses is an excellent introduction to the electronic/dubstep music style for someone who isn't familiar with the dance club/rave scene. Before I started watching other hoopdancers' videos, I had no idea what this type of music was, but I was immediately taken by it.Bass & Drum for the Masses was my first purchase in this genre, and it did not disappoint. FaithMassive takes a style of music that could easily become something dark and puts a positive spin on it with tracks that reflect their commitment as Christians. The results are a set of uplifting tracks that do more than drive a dance beat. Listening to this CD does make me want to grab my hoop, yes - but it also is one I can listen to at work or while driving. It's simply good music."
4,People ARE Funny,It;s great to see the show again after all the years. The movie isn't much good but episode is great. With they brought out more of the Episodes on DVDi'll would buy'em
2,Not bad.,"I wasn't waiting for a super blockbuster media hit with this one, but the overall experience was Ok. And it was more than enough for a title that no one speak about."
1,Should Have Guessed!,"i bought this game for 8 dollars, and was hopeful that it would at least be a little fun. within 10 minutes i was bored. i picked it up again the next day and gave it another chance. this game does have a unique weapon wielding system that is interesting for a little bit, however it gets old as you realize thats all you use to fight. every place you go in this game is EXACTLY the same thing. there is some kind of area or courtyard or large hallway that has swarms of enemies coming into it after you get close enough. OVER, AND OVER AGAIN. its the same thing. overall i dont think this game is very fun, it is not worth replaying."
2,Not a great game,"This is game is OK. It's not as fun as the other reviewers say it is. The glaive is pretty weak as a weapon. The level designs are nice and the graphics are OK. I would not really recommend this game. If you are looking for a much better game, I would highly recommend Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. I am a little disappointed with Dark Sector."
3,Bargain Bin Gem,"While the controls are imperfect, from the standpoint of how you take cover, the gameplay is still fun albeit repetitive at times. I have seen several reviewers mention that the storyline is a bit cliche, and it is, but so what, if it's fun, it's fun. I enjoyed the glaive and it's variety of uses, as well as the weapons in the game, the environments just seemed a little on the repetitive side.Who should purchase? Hardcore gamers may find this game too short and easy, but I believe casual gamers will like this title. I happen to be a fan of 3rd person shooters versus first person shooters since to me, seeing what the character is doing in action adds another element of fun to the game."
5,The Best Game,"Excelente juego. Tiene muy buenos graficos, y la trama es interesante.Muy bueno.Lo recomiendo."
2,Stuck,I was into this game then I got stuck in a level the controls are hard at times and also the game had bad reviews should of listened
3,OK,"thank U people it's was what Im looking for...In excelent conditions!Perfect delivere, brand new, I love it, nice product"
2,Meh...,"Even though the game is cheap, i dont recommend it, especially if you've just finished MGS 4, its completely dissapointing, frustrating, and quite boring.The good: GraphicsThe Bad: Boring, Horrible controls, nonsense story, annoying enemies, the glaive is cool the first times but gets boring and sometime useless, horrible close quarters combat. I stopped at the middle of Chapter 4 and dont intent to continue... moved on to bioshock (gladly).But thats just my opinion, aparently some people like it, so download the demo and just try for yourself."
2,Poor 3rd Person,"My biggest gripe is the 3rd person ""over the shoulder"" view. May as well have made it an FPS. But then I guess you wouldn't see the dude transform. Wasn't a big fan of GOW, so maybe that's why I wasn't impressed. Incredible graphics. I just didn't like the control at all. A true 3rd person adventure is Uncharted. After playing through that game, it sets the standard. Non of this over the shoulder stuff does it for me. Coming off Uncharted to this one, I was just disappointed. Dark Sector's story is boring.Don't even spend the money renting the game. Download the demo off PSN. It's only about 5 minutes of play, but that should be enough to make a decision."
3,Not Bad to play,"i bought the game but didn't played it ,till the demo released & i tried it ,well...they can do better than that but the graphic was great ,fun to play...if someone want to buy something else he/she should rent it ,if not u can buy it ."
3,"loved it, but was it worth buying it ?","well the game seemed to be really cool at the begining,i mean cool graphics and story game, but no trophies and the same moves every time .i know the game was an old release but i expected moreat first stage after shooting the enemys i just had to close it and never played it again"
4,"Solid game, original concept","This was the first game I played that really utilized the Sixaxis controller to any noticeable degree. The character's primary weapon is a throwing blade, which can be manipulated very precisely using the tilt response from the PS controller. Very cool, with an inventive storyline."
4,"Completely underrated, worth buying","The game is really good for 20 bucks, it's like Gears meets RE4. The only downside is that there seems to be no other difficulty levels but the defualt one which seems to be set to medium. I like a game to be challenging and this is not the case with this game, but it certainly has that fun factor. I'm currently on chapter 5 and the claive seems to be getting stronger as I go on, which in turn is making me unstoppable. Just to let you know I tried playing online and it seems no one plays anymore. A definite buy for $20 or less."
2,Extremely disappointing,"I am surprised this game gets the decent reviews it does. The good first: Great graphics. The game looks stunning for what it is. It controls fairly good as well. However that is where it ends. The gameplay is utterly frustrating it takes forever to beat waves of enemies and even after you get the aftertouch for the glaive it is still an inefficient weapon. The story is essentially incoherent. There are random zombies. No explanation is given as to why zombies suddenly appear. it's as though the developers said ""let's throw some zombies into the game just to spice it up, and let's make them really annoying"" I gave Dark Sector a good 3 hours and just said screw it. Skip this if you don't like frustrating games."
3,fun no. is it a game yes.,"This was like one of the first games to come out on the ps3/360 and it had all that hype surrounding it about the next gen n crap. So I picked it up. man the whole sixaxis control things was crap. it goes too fast and it's just crappy. i really didn't know what the hell was going on far as the story. all I know this is a crappy game and doesn't age well. I wouldn't buy this mess, be thankful if it's a free gift but that's about it. no good."
1,Did Not Receive,The company canceled this order. They wrote in a timely manner and told me that they had sold out. Then sent my money back.
4,It works with Suse 10 without hassle,"I bought this wireless card to replace the Linksys WMP54G v4.1 which I could never make it to work with Suse 10. To my total surprise, this D-Link WDA-1320 works with Suse 10 without any hassle - no need to use Ndiswrapper and 3rd party driver. The card was correctly detected by the system after the machine was booted up in Linux mode (it's a dual boot machine). I configured the card using Suse's YaST2 tool and that's it. This card doesn't have a great range. It comes with a tiny antenna, and even after I replaced the antenna with the bigger antenna from the old Linksys card, the signal stength is still kind of weak. There were also some minor problems during driver installation as usual. But I can't complain as it works just fine and it works with Suse 10 out of the box, thank goodness!By the way, the card I got has the Hardware Version A1 and Firmware Version 1.0"
4,Works in Ubuntu - Atheros Chip,"This card works in Ubuntu 7.04 - card was automatically detected and I was online in no time.Haven't tried Windows yet - I'll post once I've used.One thing I was curious was that the signal strength ranges around 28 - 33% even though my router is only 15 feet away. I'm afraid to increase the distance but as of now, no discernable speed loss."
2,sizing is way off,i generally wear a smal/medium and I purchased a medium and it fit like an XS. It went to goodwill...a total waste of money.
5,Guide to Owning a Ragdoll Cat,Excellent reference for Ragdoll owners. This book is so comprehensive you won't need anything else. All you need to know about your Ragdoll and more.
2,I was disappointed too,"While this book provides an adequate summary of the things I have learnt about Ragdolls, I found it difficult to read; not because the language was too technical, but because the writer seems to lack a proper grasp of how to structure paragraphs and how to move from one topic to the next. I found that some of the information was duplicated in other sections which is unnecessary. I was also disappointed at the lack of variety in cats used for the photos; the same cats appear on many pages. I would have liked to see a range of pictures showing the various colours and patterns. Despite these criticisms, I found the information about travelling with the cats useful and also the section about showing. I wouldn't rush out to buy this book if you are simply seeking more information about the breed; you have probably already found out more on the 'net. However, if you just want to have everything you know about Ragdolls in one spot, it is a good record."
5,"packed with info.,","So much so ,that i now have a kitten, and, looking foreward to see how, to the point all this book states !! so far so good, well put to-gether. Thanks Lila Au."
3,Ragdoll Book Opinion,"This book gave basic information about cats. It described the Ragdoll as sweet and docile, but that doesn't apply to all Ragdolls. I do not recommend this book unless you need to know about cats in general."
4,Ragdoll cats,"I wanted to learn more about the breed. This book was helpful & did accomplish this for me. An easy, informative read."
1,Sucks as a textbook,"I had to get this text for school and even my Philosophy tutor said it was crap. Apparently the concepts go backwards and mix together concepts that should be separate from each other. It was a hard read for this reason. It seemed to jump around a lot and nothing made sense.If it means anything to anyone, the whole class had a horrible time. I got a 63% and was awarded a ""B"" based on the class curve. The professor tried his best but this book is awful."
5,argument analysis,"I believe that this book is very informative. It provides a framework for argument analysis. I have a copy of the Copi text. However, I believe that this text has a more streamlined approach to logic and argument analysis."
5,"Different, But In A Good Way","Buckethead is probably one of the best guitar players I have heard. I mean this guy, to me anyway, is right up there with Eric Johnson, Shawn Lane, Scott Henderson, and the list goes on. This album's music is in the techno, metal style. Some of it is very strange, but it is strange in a very accessible way. Buckethead's guitar playing is just amazing, and it can go from just flat out shredding to more of a melodical approach. ""Monsters and Robots"" is one of the best albums by him, but ""Colma"" is just as good. Both are very different. This album is more on the heavier side with some great songs. Buckethead also did a good job assembling musicians who would ""fit the bill."" Some of which are Les Claypool and Brain (both of Primus fame). Anybody who loves jaw-dropping guitar playing and interesting songs will get a kick out of this album."
1,Are you all insane?,"I had high hopes for Buckethead after all the glowing reviews I've read of COLMA and MONSTERS. So I repeat -- are you all insane? This is one of the dullest discs ever wrought by a man in a plastic facemask. I don't know how many of the sounds you hear are made by a guiter, but I DON'T CARE! Outside of one interesting drum effect (track 3 or 4) there isn't an interesting musical moment to be found here. Brian May played more exciting guitar back in 1974, people. Boring, boring, boring. The only good part of this disc is the hole in the middle."
4,pretty good audio high,Well this is my first buckethead listen and it's realy amazing. After i'v been listening to praxis transmutation and c2b3 the big eyeball in the sky I can tell that buckethead is one of the craziest guitarist i'v heard in my life. Monster and robots is an eclectic kind of speed metal and funk psychedelik music combined with energy and originality. If your a Claypool fan as well as me listen to the nice bass track he did on this cd. Also the buckethead bass riff is amazing. realy a good buy
3,Worth a look,"Cool beats courtesy of Brain and some great Buckethead shards. Last track, Nun Chuka Kata, is classic."
4,A Bollywood Romance set behind the scenes of filming a Bollywood Romance.,"A fun Bollywood romantic comedy set behind the scenes of the making of a Bollywood Romance film. Charming, lively, beautiful and with some nice comic bits from the supporting cast."
4,I Hate Luv Storys,"This was the first Bollywood movie that I had ever seen. I watched it online and decided to buy it. The characters were funny - Kunal and if course ""J."". I liked also liked the soundtrack, which actually came with the DVD that I purchased."
4,"If you like music, you'll like panic","Widespread Panic is perhaps the most consistent band on the road today. Since the band formed and began releasing records, every one has been a gem. From collaborations with Vic Chestnutt on ""Brute, Nine High a Pallet"" To their own magical recordings like ""everyday"", space wrangler, and ""light fuse get away"", they never let you down. A fine mix of beautifully written music, and adventuresome improvisation, this video captures the spirit of one day in athens, ga I would love to have experienced. Luckily, this video provides me that opportunity."

They are NOT really toys, and you need to understand that when placing your order.BUT I'll warn ONE-&-ALL, do NOT order these from ""Best Service"" BEFORE placing your order on Amazon, MAKE SURE that they are NOT provided by Best Service"" they will/do NOT ship on time, OR notify you that they are NOT even in stock!I re-ordered these from ""PTOMart"" on amazon, and they shipped SAME DAY (via usps), and I got them the VERY NEXT day! TPTOMart is awsome!"
1,Heard This Cast at the Kennedy Center,"I'm a major Sondheim fan, but save your money. This show - and the mediocre score - is a dud. And that's being kind. To say this is the worst thing Sondheim ever wrote is not an exaggeration. No redeeming social (or entertainment) value. Explore ANY of Sondheim's other shows... ""Assasins"", ""Little Night Music"", ""The Frogs"", ""Company"", ""Pacific Overtures"" -- ANYTHING else."
3,Well...,"It was alright. We've all heard much better from Sondheim, and in the musical theater world it's hard not to compare a composer's new works to his old works. Having said that, I think a few of the songs lack the percussive arrangements that could make it more interesting...but that's just my take on it."
1,THen you've never heard saturday night,FOr the guy who was surprise about the mediocre quality of bounce. Sondhiem is a genius but he has made some bad scores the score for a show called Saturday Night is a clear example of another one. but we buy the cd's for postarity as much as for entertainment. And having any musical recording could prove to be handy.
2,"Re: bizarre, capricious censorship","In case you're wondering about this:>Yes, this line sort of makes sense within the context of the show as a whole (...),The ellipsis is amazon.com's, not mine. The omitted sentence comprises three words, the first two of which are ""Hollis"" and ""is"". The third word is apparently (perversely) forbidden here, so I won't repeat it (I'm guessing it's the third that's forbidden; our host might just as well be scandalized by the words ""Hollis"" or ""is"", in which case this review will include ellipses too). I'll say this much, however: 1) The third word starts with an 'h' and has ten letters. 2) It isn't slang, and it isn't pejorative. 3) It's critical for any kind of evaluation of the show; you couldn't possibly understand the pivotal relation between the characters Hollis and Addison without it."
1,A project better off abandoned.,"Having seen BOUNCE at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, and later listening to this recording, in my opinion this work is underwhelming at the very least, and quite possibly an all-out failure. My overall impression is ""Why??"" Compared to the gems of Sondheim's canon -- chief among them, COMPANY, SWEENY TODD and the often-overlooked MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG -- BOUNCE would more aptly be titled PLOP.This recording is for completists and the intensely curious only."
2,Not quite...,"Sonheim is one of the days best composers, but we all have bad days right? This was Sondheims bad day. The music is boring, Listening to the soundtrack doesnt make you want to see the show, no great ballads, basicly NOT WORTH $20. If you see this at a used CD store somewhere its one to for the collection, but not for any one looking for Sondheim. I would suggest this solely for Sondheim collectors, its not one for listening too. Favorite song: ""The Best Thing That Has Evere Happened"""
3,"Not One of Sondheim's Best, But A Couple of Nice Songs","With so many great musicals written by Mr. Sondheim, efforts such as ""Bounce"" seem flimsy in comparison. The cast's voices are fine, but most of the songs simply lack the composer's typical magic.There are, however, a couple noteable tracks, namely the title track, ""What's Your Rush"", and ""The Best Thing That Ever Happened"".Maybe with some revisions, the production will eventually arrive on Broadway - though it may be limping when (if) it does."
