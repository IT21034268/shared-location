1,Not worth a cent,"This movie really sucked, for lack of a better term. I hadnt seen it in 20 years, so I thought it would be fun to buy this DVD for my collection. It was just awful! Dont waste your time. Buy Convoy instead! I threw this one in the trash."
2,An epic that did not work for me.,"We obviously here have a good budget, heaps of actors many who are extremely talented, some rather fantastic views of nature and some interesting action scenes.But the story is terrible."
4,A good movie,I had very little hope for this when I sat down with my daughters to watch it. By the end of the movie it was clear that they all enjoyed it and so did I. One of my girls has read the books and said it was very close to it. Lets hope there are more of these.
4,I surprisingly liked it!,"I loved it! I really hope that they continue to make more movies out of this series. I'm OBSESSED with this series, and I feel a bit ashamed since I'm almost 18 and these girls are still in 7th grade! I remember reading this book when I was in 7th grade.This movie was very refreshing and the only bad thing about it was that the acting was kind of unnatural and forced at times. But unlike most movies based on books, the plot actual flowed nicely and didn't get stuck on irrelevant things.The book was well-adapted into a movie, even though there were some things that happened in the movie that didn't happen in the book. Which was kind of cool, because copying the book word for word would've made it an epic fail. This movie was anything but an epic fail. It wasn't super-duper-amazing, but it was amazing enough to make me create an amazon account to make a review about it!"
5,Great!,This book is very good. The thing about this movie is that this is what happens in real life. I love this movie. It is great!
1,"Oh dear God, NO!","This movie was TERRIBLE.The actresses absolutely sucked at portraying their roles, and they were always speaking like this: ""If I have to MISS this, EVERYONE has TO miss THIS,"" complete with the notorious head bobs. They didn't even say ""Ehmagawd!"" right...it sounded more like ""EEEEEEmohgood!""The plot was in the toilet too. This movie SCREWED UP everything the book had built. UGH!!!! I would rather gouge my eyes out with a spoon than even touch this DVD ever again.My copy of the movie is in a bin at Goodwill. I don't want to send it back in fear that someone else's home will be contaminated with it.Don't watch it. Don't buy it for your daughter. Buy her the books instead. While the books aren't amazing, at least she won't be scarred for life from this movie."
4,Clique Movie scores 4 stars,My daughter received this movie from Santa and she absolutely loves it. Her and her sister have already watched it twice!
3,Brings Back Memories,"Read ALL the books, even character ones. Movie made me laugh. Funny for teens. So many young cliche mean girl moments, but entertaining. If you enjoyed the books when you were young and are now almost 20 it's a good movie to bring back memories."
3,Mindless entertainment for teen girls.,My daughter loved reading the book series. Movie emphasized the superficiality of these girls. Used it as a discussion point with my daughter about how we treat others and what we value in our friends.
2,The Clique,"Tyra Banks producted this movie, she is known to be a tightwad and the production of this movie shows that. The actress overacted. The story line then flow like the books. My daugter was extremely disappointed (she only 10) and stated the movies was cheaply done. It was not worth the purchase price, and the ending was horrible.The Clique"
3,Silly and honest.,"I went to a school very much like the school shown in the movie, and I've been both a Massie and a Claire. Yes, there's a lot of being spoiled, shallow, and cruel- but it's also very honest about the way girls interact. Girls are mean. We've all been the outcast or the popular one. No matter how much we think everyone worships us, we still have huge insecurities. It's definitely over-the-top and makes some good points about the social system of especially wealthy kids, and is very easily accessible. It's the sort of thing a lot of young girls relate to and for that matter, it's entertaining."
5,SHARI LEWIS:DON'T WAKE YOUR MOM,THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO FOR KIDS FROM 18 MOS AND UP. I BOUGHT THIS VIDEO FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS 18 MOS. SHE IS 16 AND EVERYTIME SOMEONE BRINGS OVER THE LITTLE ONE SHE PUTS IT ON AND WATCHES WITH THEM. IT IS A VIDEO YOUR CHILD WILL NEVER GET BORED WITH.I WANTED TO BUY THIS TAPE FOR SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE LITTLE ONES AND IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF PRODUCTION. EVERYTIME I FIND ONE FOR SALE I BUY IT!
4,Bathroom Protection,"There are those people who have the urgent need to go use protection when they are in the bathroom, especially from bladder protection. My mother needs that a whole lot. When she needs a pad that will help out, she always can count on Poise. Their pads are very convient to use, and hold more moisture than other brands like Serenity, or any of those store brand knockoffs. While so many of them claim to really get the job done right, Poise delivers the best. I really recommend this brand over any brand that helps from bladder weakness for all ages.Overall: B+"
1,It won't stay up!!,"I paid too much and it won't stay up... only one screw placement actually works, the other is just there for balance."
5,speed bag perfection,Alan kahn is awesome and a great instructor.I do recommend buying the book along with the dvdthat proved to be quite helpful for me because thedvd moves at a fast rate
4,Good dvd,"The dvd is good because you can watch it and see what he is doing. You can then go practice and move on when your ready. The picture looks pretty old but isnt any concern. If your looking to learn the speed bag, this is a great video to pick up."
5,Gift for my husband!,"My husband got a speed bag for Christmas. He needed instruction as everyone thinks they know how to use a speed bag from watching TV, but they really don't understand how to use it correctly. This DVD is fine quality, the instructions make sense and are easy to follow and my husband is progressing very well. He loves the DVD and his speed bag."
4,"Buy the book, and just go.","I only ever *enjoyed* guides by Cadogan, and now Rick Steves.Italy 2004 (buy the 2005) was indispensable for my 'parachute' 3-day visits of Florence and Venice this summer. With just a little reading you can arrive totally prepared, immediately have a ton of fun, and dig deep into the local culture while avoiding the tourist scrum.Just a thought: try not to be too slavish to the Rick Steves method of everything, take chances. And be discreet. It's a pain to see everyone pulling the RS books out in every recommended restaurant, etc. Read before you go, or be discreet, and preserve the ambiance of old Italy. It's not that hard to remember how to order food is it?Downside, I only felt a few things could NOT have been updated for '04, based on some drastic increases in price, and 2 or 3 recommendations going completely down hill, compared to the description. No big deal, Italy is a crazy but fun place.4.5 stars."
5,A great book for planning your trip to Italy!,"I lived in Italy for four years before the ""Rick Steves era"", I was an ardent user of the Frommer guides, and they are great. However, Rick's guide to Italy is superb! He is comprehensive, he runs the gamut from budget to more comfortable, and he does a masterful job of pointing travelers to the best of real Italy. He candidly admits that ""Italy is his favorite country,"" and that the book is based on his opinions. However, his opinions are honest, thoroughly researched, constantly updated, and they exude common sense. He is witty, writes engagingly, and beyond everything else, I trust him, as do zillions of other travelers.Bravo, Rick! Great job!"
1,Save your money,"Rick Steve's books are all about saving your money. You should start by not purchasing this book. Potential purchasers should be aware that Rick Steve's books are aimed at a particular segment of segment of the tourist market, that is, those people who want clear and practical advice about how to get about Italy as quickly and cheaply as possible, ticking off the ""essential"" bits; but don't care very much about what they eat, where they eat, where they sleep or why things are the way they are. Last of all they want to spend their time with other tourists who think the same way. If this discription does not fit you, then there may be other books you might consider such as the Blue Guides or HV Morton."
3,Major gaps,"The title of the book is misleading: or perhaps we should take it literally--it is Rick Steves's Italy--not all of Italy. I bought it planning a vacation to the Emilia Romagna region, but there is nothing in the book about Bologna, a major city, or the rest of the region, except a short section on Ravenna. Other large areas of Italy are similarly left out. Mainly, he covers the Rome/Florence/Venice axis, with a few other places thrown in. If that's where you're going, there is plenty of information, but if you plan to go beyond the major cities, try another guide."
2,OK for the timid traveler,"This guidebook, while thorough in the cities it covers, should not be called an ""Italy"" guidebook. Entire regions, as well as Sicily, are left out, and only the most famous of the popular tourist towns are covered. The constant reminders about theft, the difficulties of driving, the traffic, the crowds, almost made me forget why I was going to Italy. The guidebook might be best for the more timid or first-time traveler who only wants the main sights in the main places, not for the traveler who hopes to experience something out of the ordinary. For travelers looking for more depth I would suggest the Lonely Planet Italy guidebook."
5,The only travel guide you need,"Not only did the book help me have a phenomenal time in Cinque Terre Italy, but everyone I met on my journey (from the USA) had the same guide book."
1,Not as shown,"I too was deceived by the picture of plate, cup and bowl, only to find that there was no plate in the set. I think this amounts to false advertising and shall certainly not buy from Macy's again."
3,Cute but not the same--,"My boyfriend has/had this set (he broke his saucer as a child) and we got it as a christening gift for my nephew. I had to double check the Wedgwood sit because I thought there had been a mistake--the plate looks VERY different from the teacup and bowl and the cup does not have ""Now run along and don't get into mischief"" behind the handle OR the picture of Peter inside (the old cup has him running along on the inside). The older set (my boyfriend's) also has much darker colors even though it is more than 20 years old. I'm still going to gift it but might have preferred to get a two-piece set instead because the teacup and bowl match well and the plate looks so strange in comparison--almost like a machine painted it and was out of an essential color. Also, the packaging is kind of ratty looking so I'll be wrapping each piece in tissue. Still cute though. And, seriously, your average little boy will not know the difference."
3,not as pictured,my mistake...picture was a three piece set and shame on me for not reading that it was only a mug and bowl set
1,"""Royal R. Rife, Humanitarian, Betrayed and Persecuted""","I should have guessed by the name that this book was a poor substitute for a worthwhile read. Poor grammer, poor punctuation, poorly researched facts and skipped around without connection. The photos were appreciated, however."
5,My life story.....,"Reading this book was like looking back at my childhood and reliving the past from beginning to end. I felt like I was reading my life story, with another woman's name on the pages. She did a wonderful job putting her story into words. This book saved my marriage, me and my children. I finally agreed to deal with the past and go to therapy. Thank you Kelli! You have inspired me and helped me realize I am not alone."
4,"High energy speed, catchy riffs, Blaine's screwed up vocals. A must have of '05","They had been talking about this album for years. And now it is finally here. The last Accused album in 1992 was okay, but interest in the ""splattercore"" sound of the Accused (Hardcore Punk peppered with some Thrash metal) wained alot. Come to 2005 and we have one of the most original releases of the year -not to mention one of the most high energy.Not too many songs are longer than 3:00, and some of the best are under 2:00. This has some of the best guitar riffs of any Accused album, it beckons back to the days of ""More Fun Than..."" ('87) but faster and with better backing vocals. The first ten or twelve songs rule. I don't think you'll find yourself changing the tracks on this CD.Favorite Songs: Filthy Hounds of Hades, N.E.S., and the second track. If you want a high energy punk/metal album this is it. Totally original and really rockin'. What more could you want?"
2,Just OK,"This was the first Elzabeth Chadwick book that I've ever read. I chose this one because according to many reviews it seemed pretty good. I have to say that I really didn't enjoy it. I think it should have been two different books because it involves two very different, but entangled, couples. I felt like the first half of the book was pretty good and I really liked the lead female character Ailith. But then in the second half, which primarily centers around her daughter, suddenly the characters from the first half that had been the main focus are practically non existent. Also, the pilgrimage storyline was completely ridiculous. I found myself skimming over most of the last 75 pages. I borrowed this book from the library and thank goodness because I'll never read this one again."
3,More historical romance than historic fiction,"I am a big fan of Eliz Chadwick, esp Marsh King's Daughter, The Greatest Knight, and Shadows and Strongholds. She has a way making history come alive; I really feel as if I am there, with characters and places as real and present. I was less than happy however with this one. I am not a big fan of romances in general, so perhaps my disappointment is more about me than about the book. I thought the ending was filled with way too many coincidences, and predictable ones at that. The writing is excellent, and the characters very well drawn out. Another reviewer mentioned the pagan aspects of the time, and I loved that part of the book. But there was passing mention of historic events and personages. Once I realized it was going to be that way, I decided to keep on reading, because she is a wonderful writer. But I must warn others that this is really a historic romance. If that is ok, read on and enjoy!"
3,strong book with a second half that veered off..........,"I agree with the reviewer who said the second half was weak and sort of dragged this would-be fantastic story down somewhat. I just did not get Julitta, she wasn't a sympathetic character to me. And the worst thing was that the author made her almost repeat her mother's mistakes (somewhat) and then conveniently disposed of the various spouses so the way can be clear for her. The characters and story of the second half really couldn't match the depth of the first half. Imagine my shock when I dropped this book unfinished!! This is Chadwick!!! It should not happen!"
3,Of mice and men,"This story is about two guys who are itinerant workers,that look for work in ranches.They always travel togethter and always get in troubleand get fired. George who is the main charachter always helps Lennie and tries to solve his problems.'Cause you got me to look after you and you to look after me'. I think that the book deals mostly about Loneliness. All is related to loneliness even the place where they work 'Soledad'. It is suitable for all ages who understand the vocabulary.I liked this book because it is very intereting and emotive"
3,Of Mice and Men,I thought that this book was good but I also thought that it was inhuman. The reason why I didn't like it is because I love animals and the way George just killed another man just like that is not right in my eyes.
2,Pretty good if you don't mind cussing.,"Of Mice and Men has an excellent plot - I didn't want to put it down once I got started. It is the story of two farmers in California in the 1930's, George and Lennie. Lennie doesn't know his own strength and consequently, it gets him a lot of trouble. The only problem I found with this book was the foul language. I was forced to read this book for school, and was shocked to discover the schooling system apparently encourages cussing, otherwise I would not have been forced to read it. A book containing murder, prositution, and extreme foul language such as that included in Of Mice and Men should, in my mind, not be a cumpulsory reading text for school. Once I learned to ignore the language problem, I found that I rather enjoyed the plot and the style in which it was written. George and Lennie's personalities are so well drawn out, it's hard to believe they are mere characters in a book of fiction. All bad content aside, Of Mice and Men was quite entertaining."
3,=I. Boring but nice,"I've to read this book for the school. I think that this is a boring story in some parts but in others its attracting.Mr. Steinbeck ruined the book by killing the only character that make me read the book.Lennie and Geoge's dream was not conceited as Curley's wife was and that show to the people the different views of social classes. I want to emphasize the theme of companionship that share Lennie & George as they said: ""I've you, and you've me"". But also show some things that wasn't attracting as loneliness, prostitution, violence and death.I would not recommend this book."
4,This is worth the money!,"For months I have been struggling with a dial caliper that measures in thousandths of an inch and whose dial is small and hard to read accurately. As many have noted, calipers that read in thousandths are great for metal working but leave a lot to be desired for woodworking.This inexpensive digital caliper is the solution! I bought mine at a recent woodworking show and I could not be happier with it. The auto zero allows you to instantly calibrate a baseline measurement and the large led display is easy to read. Best of all, it measures in standard inches so there is no calculation necessary.I have found this thing to be accurate and worth every penny. Granted it is not Starrett quality, but for the price it cannot be beat. Speaking of price, I landed mine for 26.99 at a woodworking show, so look out for better deals than this one!"
4,Performance matches price,"The Avenger MC0006 6"" Digital Caliper is a handy tool at a very reasonable price. My only complaint is that the fine adjustment knob is a little sloppy but on a sub-$100 pair of calipers I think I can deal with it. It comes with a sturdy case that leaves me comfortable enough to toss it into my tool box without worry. An all around good buy."
4,Avenger MC0006 is a STEAL for the money,"ALL of the reviews that I read complimented the operation of this product. I had problems with the LOOSE, UNINSTALLED battery. It seems that it's actual voltage was below 1.45 V. The AVENGER DATA SHEET spells out that a NEW battery is required when this happens. I wrote AVANGER PRODUCTS an email about the condition of the depleted power cell. After I sent the email, I found why this happened! The LOOSE, UNINSTALLED battery grounded itself against the CALIPER [losing VOLTAGE!].They have a packaging problem here that can be EASILY CORRECTED!The LIFETIME WARRANTY is something that none of the other reviews noted. AVENGER PRODUCTS doesn't show it on the DATA SHEET that came with the MC0006. BUT their website does when you go to register! Right above the online registration form is written: ""FILL OUT THE BELOW FORM COMPLETELY AND CLICK TO SUBMIT TO ENSURE FULL LIFETIME WARRANTY"""
4,Foundational Work,I only give it 4 stars because it is so dry at times but it is more of a notebook than a book. Its pretty much the standard tooth cutting material for anyone wanting to learn evocational magic.~Marz~
5,"The Goetia, a MUST have","The Lesser Key truly a marvelous tool for the working magican. Even now, I am gathering the tools and other item necessary for an exorism. I have even got several Wiccan friends now buy their own copies."
1,Seems to be the answer to a lot of unknowns.....,Bought this book and a partner book as well...both by MathersA lot of work went into these editionsI was looking for some answers...any answersWhat I found was ridiculous trashy ideas...so unintellectual it was difficultto even imagine this as literature....There must be a faction of our society that is beyond illiterateSorry I wasted my money on these books. I trashed them.
4,I really liked this.,"If you're into this sort of thing, this translation/edition is put together very well. Tastefully done, I think. I've yet to be disappointed by anything I have picked up by Mather. But, it's only if you're into this sort of thing. Promise."
2,Get something different,"Look in the bottom right hand corner...if the CD says it's by ""Sinclair Institute"" don't waste your money. Example, ""Aphrodisia, Euphoria, and Indulgence"".If you want an excellent choice for sensual music then buy the set of 3 CD's called, Erotic Moods: The Collection. MUCH better choice!"
1,Quite possibly the worst keychain ever!,"I only had this item for three days before it broke. Too big to be a keychain, it always poked me in the leg when ever I sat down with the keys in my pocket. Also when driving it would hit the other keys on my keyring and it would constantly make this annoying noise for the entire car ride. Maybe it is more for a backpack or something, but even then it is just so freakin huge!! Just plain terrible."
4,Great Beginner Guitar,"Purchased this 1/4 size guitar as a Christmas present for my little boy. I am quite impressed with the fit and finish. Tone quality is perfectly acceptable for the body size and purpose. For the price, the Jasmine is the perfect choice for youngsters exploring music for the first time, who will outgrow the guitar within a year or so. You can pay twice the amount, but you will not get twice the value. You can be confident in your purchase of this little guitar."
1,Disapointing,"I was very disapointed with this book. Now, I am a big Connie Mason fan and I have read many of her books, but I found this book very unoriginal. It has the same tired plot used in many romance novels. It seemed like Mrs. Mason just took one of her previous novels, changed the characters and the plot a little, and then gave it a new title. I was so bored reading this book that I didn't even finish it. It might get better, I don't know, but if you are looking for an original plot don't get his book."
3,An average read.,"I have read a couple of books by Connie Mason, and usually I like most of her books, especially the older ones. This book was not very interesting, some of the love scenes were pretty good, but her trademark sensuality seems to be missing from her books now a days. I did not find anything remarkable about the novel.....though I finished reading it pretty fast."
3,3 and A Half Stars.....,Rose was strong and had a quick wit about her. Dominic did what was required of him and was very thoughtful when it came to the heroine. The love scenes between the two of them were pretty hot ? worth reading!!! I did feel that the story was rushed at times but all in all was a pretty decent read.
1,A formula without excitement.,"I did not like this book at all. It is a basic formula... landless knight marries wealthy heiress. Of course, relatively speaking, all romance novels are a formula to a degree. It is the twists on the plot that the author can offer and the creation of characters that are dear to the reader that makes the book different and one worth remembering.I found that I did not care about either Rose or Dominic. They were entirely too one-dimensional. The story did not build suspense and as stated, it is merely a simple formula. There is the obigatory spurned lover who stirs up trouble and the villian from which the hero must save the heroine, but again, it simply did not hold my interest. On the plus side, Ms. Mason does a good job of creating passionate and sexy love scenes, but overall, this was not enough to hold my interest."
2,"cheap, but not worth it","I have used bosch tools for a long time, and this one just is not up to the task. There is only 1 set of blades, the chips plug, and it is underpowered. For simple use, it might be OK, but if you need a planer, do not waste your money on this cheap version."
2,will not hold up to being used every 15 min during the day,"We have had a new model of this plainer for a view years and it did occasional jobs but last week we started to use it to take off layers of paint. The cycle was to run for ~1min of use then sit for ~15 min. After two days of use it had start up problems and I tracked it to the bearing for the cutter head, once I opened the case up I found that all the bearings in the planer were running rough so this will be tossed and a new more robust planer will be purchased."
1,Not what is in the picture,"The planer is great but TOOL KING has a picture of the planer with a fence that allows you to change the angle of the plane. This is not the fence included with the planer. This is a deluxe fence that you have to buy separately. When I got the planer I was not impressed with the folded sheet metal fence that came with the machine. I doubled checked the webpage for the planer and it does not say ""planer pictured with deluxe fence-sold separately"" it should say this on the page.I would this is a bait and switch sale tactic used by tool king. I would buy the planer again, but probably not from tool king."
3,A GHOSTLY SCENE,"Family reunions are ghastly affairs. You meet relatives that you neverthought you had and indeed didn't want. Ah, but what can you do? Dear,dear Bess comes across a relative only she can see. He's been dead fora few centuries ( like five) and is determined to make a come back ifhis little cousin will invite him into her world.Say hello toWalter, a charming ghost with an old score to settle with some humanswho impoverished his family and is about to do the same to youngBess's. Walter is not some run of the mill ghost but is Sir WalterRaliegh, himself, explorer, would be pharmacist and pain in thebutt.Enjoy this little comedy as you see Walter mess things up forBess and cause havok throughout his visit. The acting is average andthe plot okay. My Friend Walter is a good view for a rainy day. Kidsand grownups alike will enjoy the affairs of this duo."
3,almost worth it,"I couldn't believe how teeny tiny this book was when it came to my house. I passed the management course I was taking, so I guess this book little book was beneficial, but now I would love to get rid it."
3,Review Only,Product is good as a review but not for a primary text. Too vague if you are unfamiliar with the topics.
3,MBA Required Item - Outrageous Price!,"This book is another example of the ridiculous pricing for school text books. If you are required to purchase this book for MBA School, don't be surprised when you receive it. I guarantee the initial response will be ""what - 40+ dollars for this?"" The content may be exceptional but the book itself inspires one to ask the question why am I spending this much money for a small paper bound book?"
4,"If you liked Kite, you will probably like Mezzo..","Mezzo is the TV version of the OVA - ""Mezzo Forte"". Its not as bloody as Mezzo Forte, telling the story of the 3-person private security team called the Dangerous Service Agency, but I found myself laughing at the funny parts and the animation is well above average."
3,Kind of toned down..and then some...,"Mikura and her partners run DSA - which stands for Danger Service Agency - who do almost anything dangerous for the right amount of cash. While there is a lot of action, and fan service, the artwork seems a tad choppy or too still, like there was a low cell count during much of the episodes. Also, some of the plot lines, like the one about aliens, were lame. The last two out of the five episodes DID seem to have a better, strong, story - maybe because they used two episodes to tell the story from different points of view? The two-episode story also used Mezzo's background, from the OVA, and seemed a tad touching at times.Extras, like the opening/closing animation, ADV previews and production sketches were nice, but even after the first five action-packed episodes the whole series already feels weak and the disc did not seem worth the money I dished out.Get it used and only if you're already a big fan of Mezzo Forte/Kite anime. Suggested for 15 and up."
4,just alright,I was disappointed that this show Mezzo was nothing like it's hentai version Mezzo Forte and Kite. To me that doesn't look right seeing the same character with two different sides of life. In theis series she suppost to be some kind of an action star or whatever the violence wasn't even bloody that suck. Just one more thing I want to add if amazon can sell Mezzo then they should sell Mezzo Forte.
5,Awesome Aussie Artists/Covers,"If you are a lover of covers, this album is for you. Nobody else could do a cover of AC/DC's 'It's a long way to the top' like Aussie kid's band The Wiggles. The Screaming Jets do a rocking version of 'my heart will go on' (the only decent version there is) Hear a Russian choir do 'Downunder' and Rolf Harris add his own personal note to 'I Touch Myself' An absolute corker of an album - extremely rare & hard to get."
4,Fun Series,Seasons 3 and 4 are my favorite of this show. I can't wait to finish collecting them all.This show definitely put a spin on sci-fi. It's fun and it's entertaining. If you are a true sci-fi fan you'll love this show.Give it a try (rent) before you buy!
3,"I wish I could give this set a higher rating, but...","The starburst editions are supposed to have better special features, but with the latest sets, the special features are getting bad."
4,Like it,"The story has improved dramatically since the start. The special effects are reasonable. The acting is good. The characters, I think you will find need more work to make them look visually nicer. Overall the problem is the show it looks like it is on a small budget. Not that this makes a film not worth watching. Having said that I wish the producers had hired some science adviser's to check the science out of the stories as much of it is unplausible science. This would have costed them little.Overall I would say the series is well worth watching although I do think it is not as good as some similar shows like B5 or firefly. Still after you have seen them. This is worth a look."
3,The Minister's Charge,"The Minister's Charge cannot be rated, in my estimation, as one of Howells better works. Although the relationship between the minister and his charge is intriging, the superferlous details of the young characters social life drags on and on in its useless verbosity. I enjoy Howells, and appreciate most of his works, but I labored through this book but ultimately had to leave the last 30 pages unread."
4,Interesting Book,"An overview of the war to the summer of 62. The ideas presented are well grounded and provoke real thought. Not a book that will sit well with many readers but a worthwhile addition to any Civil War Library. Read this and than read ""Taken at the Flood""."
4,A Well Written Novel of Israel,"Most people who know this author are familiar with his work on the great Rogue Warrior series. And his work with Richard Marchinko is awesome.However, he wrote this book solo before the whole Rogue Warrior thing. The novel is a interesting and entertaining look at modern Israel and the issues of security and peace it shares with its neighbors.I enjoyed the book very much and was very interested in its depiction of Israel. The author does some great stuff with the Rogue Warrior and I hope he does some more solo work too."
2,A fraud,"This is not a translation of the classic german edition of Dreihundert Schachpartien. Some parts of the biographical introductions are omitted, in some games the notes are brutally mutilated. In the match with Tschigorin- the best part of the book- some games are reduced to a joke.Well, the book gives access to a classic book to people who does not understand german. I would not object if the reduction of the original material was advertised at the front page. Abridged and adapted by Sol Schwarz. Then you would know what you were buying. As it is, it's a fraud."
4,"Great Book, Mediocre Edition","First of all, about the quality of the work itself enough has been said already. It is simply outstanding. This review is merely intended to warn potential buyers of the English edition that they are going to miss something compared to the German original. Up to now I can only judge from the excerpts available at Amazon.com, but these sadly show the autobiographical sections being heavily truncated which is all the more disturbing as they are the passages which show Tarrasch's great, often self-ironic style at its best.My recommendation for all English-speaking readers: if you have any knowledge of German, go for the original edition! By the way, the same applies for Nimzovich's My System. This is, if you are interested in the prose sections at all. If you want this book merely for the games and annotations, the English edition will do, but don't say I didn't warn you!"
5,A great book and a great man,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. He has a great writing style and his accomplishment was remarkable. His courage and persistance is amazing.As an aside, I met William in China and spent a few days walking with him on the ""wild wall"". It is just as amazing as he details in his book. He is a very nice chap and is now quite an authority on the Great Wall of China. I hope he continues to write!"
4,Review of the Grizzly calipers,"I am a hardcore billiards enthusiast, and I ordered the calipers to measurethe tip (or ferrule) sizes in millimeters. Useful in billiards discussions, or when buying, trading, or selling cues. I carry it in my cue case."
4,Not so complete,"This ""kit"" is just a little book with some picture cards. There are other books out there that have much more information, along with the pictures.This is good to keep in a pocket or purse for general information."
4,Great for beginers,Covers all the basics. This does not get to detailed into meanings and the definitions of the lines. Points out which lines are what and also your personality type by the shape of finger nails/hands. Great way to start.
3,Arrived damaged,I ordered this book as a present for my daughter. I have personally used this book myself & know it to be a very clear/basic book for a beginner. However the book arrived severely bent. With a crease that cannot be corrected. Disappointing.
3,viola,"was just a little disappointed on this cd, some songs were ok, just a little upset that ""stormy weather"", and ""up on the roof"" is not on any of her cd's i believe ""stormy weather"" was her first 12"" single"
3,"Shakuhachi ""CC""","A great gift! Unfortunately, not being familiar with the instrument iteself before purchase, the instructions were not very informative. Unless you are familiar with the use of this instrument, and sound or music making can be difficult. On the bright side, it is VERY unique!"
5,Shakuhachi,"Great price - great value. I received it in record time, extremely fast shipping. Would definitely purchase from them again."
1,Horrible,You can not call this an instrument. Do not waste your money on this!A plastic flute sounds better then this. Just horrible!
2,library steps,"This is the second time I am submitting this review. When the steps were received, they were missing a hinge for the step ""drawer"". There is a mar on the bottom step. I was very disappointed in the piece I received. Surely there must be a quality control that looks at a piece before it is shipped. These two problems were so obvious, we noticed them the second we unpacked it."
1,Cherry Finish Bed Step STool,"Fell apart the second time it was used as I was using it to climb into bed. The top step came un-stapled and ""shifted"" me off the stool. Wasn't injured and because I really need a step-stool to get into bed I just glued the step back in place"
4,High hopes a little dashed,"When I opened it I loved it -! I was thrilled because I had originally seen it for more money on line & this price was at least $40 less. It was packed excellently, it was heavy which exuded quality-not flimsy at all, but the finish on the bottom step could have been better & there is a corner not finished -wood showing."
1,Hinge broke after 2-3 weeks of use,"I was expecting higher quality when I purchased it. It takes up a great deal of space and is easy to trip over at night. Now, it's out on my back porch as the hinge on that compartment that opens up tore away from the wood. It's too expensive to pack up and ship it to return it, so I'm stuck with it.I do not find fault with the seller as they shipped it well, carefully and promptly. They are good people, just this product is poor. I'm really sad about it being broken. I never even stored anything in that place so it wasn't like I was opening and closing it. It is just poorly made. Pretty expensive for something that will fall apart so easily and quickly."
1,Order Flubbed,"Hello, I received the wrong book. I never received ""Painting as a Past Time"" by Churchill, but ""Churchill His Life and Times"" by Thomson. I plan to keep the Thomson book, but still want ""Painting as a Past Time."" How can we make this happen?"
5,benedetti piano,amazing talent. will have to get more of his recordings. his style and interpretation are unique. surely worth anyone's decision to listen to him play.
3,CUTESEE TURTLE,"This turtle is cute! That 16 year old was wrong to say that they were ""Retarded"", that was his opinion,and this is mine:The turtle (when i got it, at least) also came with a cute little lei. If you're like me, and like bugs,his carrier can be used temporaraly as a home for small bugs.Gotta go,My ""tummy"" really hurts,Darcy"
1,Bring back the old littlest pet shops,"I loved the old pet shops, they were so cute, and they looked like real animals. Bring them back. The new ones are so ugly, their eyes are too big for their heads, and the bobble head thing makes me think that they are for the dashboard of a car. Please, bring back the old designs. I wont be buying these, unless they are really cheap, or i get it as a present"
2,poor customer service,"I only used this sander 3 times before it stopped working. When I contacted Bosch,they said to ship it to a repair center BUT I HAD TO PAY THE SHIPPING. Not sure yet what the action will be; they couldn't tell me if they could fix it r not. The sander was about 6 months old when it went down so it should be under warranty. I have had other Bosch tools in the past and liked them; I guess it is just the customer service--or lack of--that makes me dissatisfied."
5,"Excellent, Funny, and Thought-Provoking","I found this book to be a delight! The concepts (if put in to practice) can change your reality. Really. Some will seem strange at first, some will seem impossible to take in. Antero Alli's vision, though, can help you see things in a liberating way."
1,False advertisement,"The item is advertised as a genuine Dirt Devil Filter. What I received was a substitute made for ""More Quality Less Money"". False advertisement."
2,vac filter,"great can vac, lousy paper filter, seems strange that the filterwould be paper but housing is more expensive...i've had otherfilters you could clean in soapy water"
3,not the correct part,"The description on Amazon is incorrect. This does not fit the breeze canister vacuum. However, amazon was excellent as always about the return and I got the correct part, the F3 HEPA filter, which works on the Breeze 82500."
1,awful,"These filters are awful, I've ordered 3 less than 2 months ago and I can't even use them anymore. I guess you get what you paid for. The ""genuine"" F12 might be ~$20 but at least it's good for 3-4 months, it's not ready to go in the garbage after a week."
5,Hepa Filter,"This filter worked great. The Dirt Devil Replacement HEPA filter was inexpensive, easy to order and it arrived quickly. We were skeptical when ordering as to whether or not it would fit and were pleasantly surprised when it fit perfectly and worked as well as the original."
4,WRITING FOR THE GLORY OF GOD,"A GROUP OF DIVERSE LADIES SHARE EVIDENCE OF GOD'S WORKINGS IN THEIR LIVES..... THE WRITINGS ARE AS COMFORTING TO THE READER AS A ""HEART TO HEART"" WITH AN OLD FRIEND....... A STANDOUT EXAMPLE IS 'SWEET INSPIRATION'.....THE WORDS EMBRACE YOU WITH A WARMTH AND SINCERITY...YOU'LL SMILE, YOU'LL RELATE.... AND YOU'LL LOOK FOR MORE FROM THIS GIFTED STORYTELLER"
4,sturdy,"I'm more disappointed with size and the limited stretch on the elastic than the overall quality. Could be I'm trying to cram too many documents in one folder.But everything fit, its just a bit tricky to open its so tightly filled. I've gone through so many accordian paper folders that this seemed perfect-I would like it a bit larger and able to open wider."
5,Expanding file,"The expanding file is very professional and elegant looking primarily because of its colors. The colors of the file would probably are more indicative of the male population, but doesn't limit a female from acquiring one. The fact that this expanding file expands from the bottom too, makes it a more desirable one among expanding files types available to buy because allows a larger number of papers to fix from the ones that don't expand below. This design peculiarity goes often ignored unless one has used both types."
3,Paperwork Organizer Tear Resistant?,Not sure if this is going to work long term . Says it is tear resistant not sure for how long. It is kind of cheap. We will see
4,Good but takes some getting used to,"This is a great accordion folder. I actually bought one because my friend swears by them for school use. So I bought it and the overall construction of it is very good and durable. The only thing I don't like is that the flap doesn't stay open unless you fold it back all the way and then hold it. Also, papers tend to get caught on the sides where the accordion folds are. But these are just small things that may annoy you. Other than that, this is a pretty good product worth 4 stars!"
2,expanding file,"This looked very sturdy, so I bought it for my son for school. The back of the file was wripped away from the rest within the first 2 weeks. Very disappointing for the price."
4,Good file organizer,"Not bad for a plastic file organizer. The cover can be bent back so it doesn't get in the way, and so far it has been holding up after moderate use."
5,Works very well!,"I'm using this just to file bills, so it's perfect! It's very sturdy and holds quite a bit!"
4,good.,"I purchased it as a gift and expected it to be bigger but it did a pretty good job at storing all that he needed stored, so it worked out."
3,Rather small,"Purchased two of these to hold 2012 tax, financials and other documents. I probably should have gone to Staples and bought them in person rather than sight unseen online. These are much too narrow to hold a full year's worth of documents. Wouldn't buy these again."
4,Good price and no hassle shipping.,This folder is to keep track of my monthly receipts. It is compact for easy storing. The price was good and was shipped in a reasonable time. The folder should work fine.
5,Great product,"Very sturdy material and easy to expand (I've used some in the past that you have to fight with to get it to expand, stay open AND get the paper inserted). Great price for a quality product."
5,short but sweet,"true the songs are few, but what are there are ""chop"" full of ""good""ness, get it? Anyway this one is really good. The only set back might be the lack of songs consitering that 2 of them are on thier previous album l.o.t.g.a (also great) but the song raygun is worth the money by it's self. I say buy it, so go, now!"
3,Interesting but...,"The idea was to use this to be more effecient in my daily work. I do a great amount of work with forms that are not Tab friendly. This isn't the secret to working more effeciently.Contrary to the documentation, you will not get anything close to a normal typing speed out of this. The buttons have a very heavy touch, meaning your hand will tire far to quickly. The key combo's are easy to learn it's true, but just knowing what to press isn't a great help. And complex passwords are basicaly impossible to type on this unit.The driver support is laughably bad, I attempted to pair this with my treo 650 and my laptop both, and both times it was a nightmare. Driver support is strictly third party, so problems installing and setting up are pretty much your own to deal with.That having been said, there is a definite market for this unit, though a specialized one. Disabled people will find this a huge step up from anything else on the market."
3,Big learning curve,This product takes a long time to learn so I do not recommend it for shorter-duration injuries (broken arm). By the time you learn it you'll be able to use a keyboard again.Customer service from the FrogPad company is very poor.
3,Good but already have problems!,When I first got this vacuum it was great but 4 months later after light use in a one bedroom apartment the self propel mode just broke and now it is a ton to move around. Also it doesn't appear to suck as well either because before it use to leave nice crease in the carpet so you could see its clean but now no more and it only comes with a 90 day warranty. I'm not person who cared about a vacuum being self propelled because I'm use to vacuum's that didn't propel but this thing seems to not want to move like the brakes are on. I plan to call Hoover to see if can still service it but I'm afraid it won't be worth it since I paid so little.
5,Outstanding,"Update 4-17-2012:Waiting for a couple new books to ship I re-read ""None Came Home"". In my opinion this was one of the greatest books I have ever read. Although I remember most of the accounts in the book it dragged me in again, as if it was the first time reading it. I hung onto every word and pictured the scenes as they played out.When im finished reading a book I always pass it along for others to enjoy. This book and ""Guns Up"" however are staying with me. I will gladly purchase more copies as gifts but no one is going to get mine! Haha.I would love to meet Mr. O'Donnell and shake his hand and thank him not only for his service but his valiant effort at attempting to bringing these amazing soldiers home."
2,This book was a let down.,"I didn't care for the writing style, or the significant issues with grammar throughout the book. It felt very much as if the book had not been proof read at all.I did like the content of the stories and the experiences. I just didn't feel a connection with the author, or the way he went about telling this very important story.The story of Military Working Dogs is truly one that needs to be told. And the betrayal by our own government, as outlined in this book, is something that everyone should be aware of. Thankfully, our MWD's are treated vastly different today. The do come home, and so long as they are physically and mentally capable, they will be retired and adopted at the end of their military service. Working with MWD's has been the proudest experience of my life."
1,None Came Home,"This book is a complete ""Fake"". This writer refered to feelings of ""Giddy"" 3 times before I closed the book. Soldiers don't feel ""Giddy"". Dogs don't ""raise their legs"" to show contempt. If you check this guys record, I'll bet he was never in Vietnam. One more person who didn't do anything claiming to be a hero!"
4,practical and no fancy,"I am going to use these in a separate box file to collect notes taken to use later. Every side, overall six, can be used to organize documents by sub category within a specific project. I have seen people use it in meetings regarding children's IEP. The advantage compared to a binder is the smaller bulk. It must be practical for students on different subjects."
4,"Not a pocket folder, but nice and sturdy","This was my mistake, I thought it was a pocket folder. It's not. It has metal tabs that you can use to file papers which are punched out. So it's good for receipts and records (like medical records), etc. But you still need to punch holes in your papers to file them.The folders themselves are nice and sturdy."
4,Sturdy folder to help you get organized,"These folders are sturdy; much more so than the typical manila folder. The thickness is comparable to a report cover. They are expandable to allow you to store plenty of paperwork within each folder. I like the dividers within the folder to help group papers, but still keep in one folder. If you punch holes in the tops of your papers and use the fasteners, the papers will be secure in your folder. However, I didn't realize the sides were open, so unless you are keeping the folders in a file drawer or box, you will need to use the fastener to keep the papers from falling out. The five colors make it easier to organize your papers and find what you need.It a well-made folder for both home or office use."
3,"Decent, but pricey folders","Nice, heavy duty folders. The dividers within work great for separating different types of papers. Each folder contains 6 prong style fasteners should you wish to secure documents to the folder. Strong Tyvek tape holds folder together nicely. Color coded, so files can be easily categorized and located. On the downside, they don't have sides on them like pocket folders do, so small, unsecured papers can fall out, plus the folders are quite pricey."
3,Folders/Dividers,"This is a great time of the year to get these Smead Dividers/Folders for organizing those papers that are forevermore accumulating and getting lost. Get them organized in these coloful folders, labeled and put away where you can find them later in the year. They are super strong so you will not have to worry about them getting squashed or wrinkled in the drawers. Just right for your hanging files or pretty on a shelf. Mine came from Amazon at just the right time!!Smead 100% Recycled Classification Folder, Letter, 2/5 Right Of Center, 2 Dividers, Green, 5 Per Pack (14057)"
4,What's not to like?!,"Fabulous folders from a well known brand name - sturdy and eyecatching, these folders will last longer than the paper you put in them. I like the sustainability of using 100% recycled products even in the home office. These folders are perfect for complex subjects needing sub-filing."
4,Great Fantasy Novel,"Sword and sorcery fantasy is pretty much my favorite thing to read and after skimming the first two pages of Memories in the bookstore I was well and truly caught. No, this isn't the most original plotline in the store, and yes the editor should be shot on general principles, but honestly, I enjoyed this book too much to care. Wexler takes some great stock characters (unbeatable swordsman, child genius, cocky nobles, plucky foot soldiers, dangerously self-interested higher beings) and puts them into a fun, clever, well written story. I can't wait for next book."
5,Excellent introduction to basic Splus.,"The Amazon synopsis accurately describes the content and function of this book. Each chapter includes multiple examples of the structure of the syntax and use of Splus functions, and concludes with exploratory exercises (with solutions) to further the chapter theme. I am a graduate student with a modest understanding of statistics and virtually no programming experience. This book enabled me to construct custom bootstrap functions for exploratory data analysis within two days of beginning to learn Splus. This book is more easily read than any other Splus guide I have found, and I would recommend it to anyone using Splus, beginners and experienced users alike."
2,good model but very inaccurate,It is too bad when good model companies like this one release inaccurate models. The Me-328 was perhaps considered on paper as part of the Mistel project but never carried out as the 328 was still a prototype just as a DO-217 wasn't used. The aging bombers used were JU-88 or occasionally a DO-17. The 2 planes that were used in the Mistel project to control the explosive-filled JU-88 bombers were either the Bf-109 and FW-190 with the Me-262 and AR-234 as other ideas. An accurate model would have used either of these combinations.I agree that swastikas should have been used on the tails but any hobby shop can provide you with the decals. I use a hobby website called Bad Cat Toys. Excellent shop.
3,"Nice model for the price, but this is not 1/72 Scale","This model is not 1/72 scale. I have a large collection of 1/72 WWII aircraft, so I thought that this would be a neat addition. The set I received is the postage stamp collection (1/100). While it is an interesting model and does have educational value (despite historical inaccuracies), I am going to ""gift it"" to a friend since the scale is off. I gave the model acceptable marks, because of its relative inexpense. As a historical model, it loses points for having a Me 328 strapped to a Do 217E; however, it should make one want to learn more about this project. Perhaps a firm will do this model correctly in diecast someday. I never removed it from the box, because the scale discrepancy was A) apparent immediately and B) written on the box. If the actual scale is on the box, why do they keep advertising this as 1/72?"
3,Pattern is upside down,"Seat sock is a great idea. I have trouble finding lid covers for our large lid, and this does fit. The seat sock does not look like the photo on the package. It is actually a repeated pattern all over the material, not just one big picture.The real problem is when the lid is closed, the pattern is upside-down when you walk in the bathroom. It is right side up when the lid is open. In our house, the lids are always closed when not in use. Therefore, the pattern is always upside down:-("
1,Very disappointed!,"My son got this as a gift for Christmas. Within the first 7 days of having it, it ripped. The material is so thin and paperlike that the rip has gotten much bigger. This is a tent that is supposed to be designed for boys, you think that they would make it with material that is much more durable!"
3,Help me,"My son also got this for Christmas after his grandmother looked in 4 different stores. She finally found it. He loved it but, the polls have splintered and broke after he ruff housed in it a few times. If any one knows where to get new poles please email me at secretsispl@yahoo.com. If the manufacture reads this and would like to email me with help please do."
3,This toy is fun but not durable!,"My kids all really enjoy this tent. However, the sticks that go in this are not durable at all. My kids love this tent, but I need to know if I can find replacement parts anywhere for it. So if anyone knows where I can get some new sticks for it please let me know! My kids had a blast with this while it lasted, for about a month!"
3,SPIDERMAN TENT,"The tent would have been great, but the sticks that go inside to hold it up are thin and made of wood. My kids snapped the sticks in about 5 places within the first week. Otherwise, I think it is great."
5,A great gift,"A compelling, heartwarming children's book that captures not only the spirit of Christmas, but the spirit of the human soul. It helped to remind me about what is so special about this time of year. A great gift for the holiday season."
5,Outstanding Children's Book,"I've haven't laughed so hard with my kids during bedtime storyreading yet. The story is superb and the rhymes are so easy and fun to read aloud. Best of all, the beautifully crafted illustrations are masterful and difficult to remove your eyes from. Holiday books like these make me wish my kids would never stop believing in Santa."
5,Great present,I bought this book for my sister because her name is also Santa. I love the written story in the book as well as the pictures; sheets could be thiner and there could have been more to read and more to look at though. But all in all it is a great book.
3,A Place Apart,"I gave ""A Place Apart"" by Paula Fox three stars, because it was a good book, but it did not wow me. I like books that are full of suspence or that have a unpredictable ending. This book was mostly about a girl and the troubles that she has to deal with in life. The book would be interesting to people who want to know about other kind of lifestyles in life. Some people are wealthy and life comes easy to them, but for Tori her life is rough and confusing. The book is about a girl and her life, having her father just died, her mother and her smoking problems, and her relationship with Hugh, a guy she knows. So in conclusion I think you should give this book a chance."
3,It is a great example of how to deal with your problems.,"This books shares a wonderful thought for everybody, especially thoose who lost someone they have lost.Hopefully one day those will not have a tragdic lost in there lives like victoria and her mother have been through. When they went through this, they learned more than they expected, for instance they became closer in there relationship, and also, they learned to deal with there problems in mature ways."
1,t-mount to unthreaded pipe,"This allows you to thread a T-mount ring onto an unthreaded pipe. There are three hex screws to lock the thing onto an unthreaded pipe. This did not suit my needs, but may suit yours."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!,"I have never writen a bad review for a toy before; however, in this case I am not only writing a bad review but asking you not to buy this toy. The poles on the tent splintered, broke, and poked through their slip. Not only did they poke my children I got a half inch splinter through my finger. The idea is good, the tent is fun, but because of the poor quality of the tent poles, the tent is not only trash within 24 hours it is DANGEROUS!"
4,great for self study of classical chinese,"the book is well-organized and set up for self study, although it would also work well in a classroom setting. Of particular value are the various indices that contain the essentials of grammar and syntax forClassical Chinese. the follow-on volume appears to be equally valuable as a continuation of this one."
3,Hechizos para el Amor (Spanish Edtion),My wife asked me to buy this book for her. She searched everywhere and could not find the book. She uses the book for reference so I'll have to conclude that she likes the book. So I'll have to give this book three stars only since I'm not the one who's reading it. (Maybe she has the other two stars)
3,good for the price,"Pros: Cleans carpet very well, has a good filter to keep fine particles inside, is pretty cheap.Cons: Not good for bare floors. There is no way to turn off the agitator, so on a smooth surface it tends to simply throw the heavy bits (cat litter, large crumbs, sand) behind it rather than pick them up.Other thoughts: cleaning fine particles (wood dust etc) off the filter is a mess.This vacuum is pretty good for it's price, but it's only good on carpet."
1,Broken drive belt after 5 month,"Bought this ""ReConditioned"" item on 3/10/08. The drive belt broke on 8/10/08. Without a working drive belt, this vacuum cleaner is useless.Also, this unit is too noisy.Stay away."
3,"Not Bad ,Not Great","I found myself struggling to lift it up and down the stairs.Also,it makes plenty of noise,bad job by the factory.works fine."
3,Very Noise and no Dirt Finder doesn't look like the one in the picture,I looked at the pictures and it showed dirt finder icon. The picture is not correct but for the money I paid it's ok. It's quite noise but I don't really mind. Picks up a lot and quite powerful. Just fish Amazon would be more precise with the pictures.
3,Nice value but with design flaws,"The vacuum pictured is not the one received, there is no cleaning sensor. When the container is clean the suction is really good, but I have experienced having to clean the container between rooms because of clogging in the filter between the first and second chamber, which is annoying. When the container has very little dirt with the majority on the filter between the chambers, I don't see being able to empty the container when full because of this and do not understand why it was designed with a container that size when only a fraction is used."
5,Awesome Product for Allergy/Asthma sufferers!!!,"I am a severe allergy sufferer. We moved into an older home a few weeks ago, and the years of buildup under the carpets just overwhelmed me. This vacuum pulls it ALL up! Granted, I spent 11 hrs vacuuming the first weekend, and had to clean the filter every 2-3 minutes due to the buildup, but now I vacuum every day and can vacuum the entire house before having to empty the filter cup. This is an amazing product! Now, my mom, my sister, my grandmother, and I each own one. I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially allergy and asthma sufferers."
1,Hoover review,"I wasn't too confident to purchase this but we received a gift cert. so it was free. It worked pretty good at first, but after about a week it made some funny noises and the suction stopped working. I would return it but I threw away the box and receipt. I wouldn't recommend this vacuum. It's also pretty heavy, I'm probably just used to my old lightweight vacuum."
4,Happy with the cleaner,I am satisfied with the product. It has decent suction power on carpet. I have not tried it on bare floor. It does not have seperate vacuum pipe for small parts. It is all integrated which is not so convinient. Apart from that it works great.
1,2 years later BROKE!,"My wife and i recieved the hoover windtunnel bagless upright as a wedding gift about 21 months ago and was used only to vacuum a small apartment. The problem is a poor design in how the bagless container attaches to the vacuum. At the begining it created a good seal but after cleaning the bagless container out reguarly for 21 months (and remeber this is a small apartment im talking about 850 sq. ft. and thats is including the kitchen and bathroom) the connection became more and more loose each time i removed the bagless to clean it, now the connection wont even hold the conntainer in .it just falls out and without a secure connection suction is completely lost. my reconmendation is to save your money and buy somthing else."
1,NOT AS PICTURED!,"I have never written a review before, but I am very disappointed, so here goes. I purchased this item because of the clean/dirty sensor light pictured on the front. What I received is an older, physically ""beaten up"" and scratched model. It works fairly decently, but it IS NOT AT ALL what is advertised. Be careful!"
1,WARNING BEFORE BUYING,Product arrived with a canister full of someone else's dirt. No attachments were included and the handle was broken. Vacuum was so filthy I had to wash it outside before I would even consider bringing it into my house. The cord is so frayed that I am afraid to even plug it in. This pile of junk is being returned!!!
2,not so hot,This machine works well. It does not turn off until I pull the plug and is noisy but it does what it is expected to do..suck.. the price was right
3,vacums,I like it alot but it has too many filters and is heavy to pick up. I though when I bought it was light weight and didnot have alot of filters to replace.
2,Terrible Accessory suction,The main part worked great but the light didn't work from day 1 and there was very little suction to the accessories.
2,Not Worth the Money,"We've had this vacuum for less than a year, 11 months to be exact. About 2 weeks ago, the darn thing totally craps out on us. For the first 6 months it was really great, but then the suction started to die out. Toward the end, you could barely feel any suction through the hose. When you buy a vacuum, you'd expect it to last at least a few years, not a few months. Not worth the money in my opinion, but if you're tight on cash and expecting a big paycheck in the foreseeable future, this one will work until you can afford a better one."
2,Not for homes with Pets!,I have this vacuum and it has great suction while you are vacuuming but I end up cleaning the filter out half way between finishing one room. It clogs up the filter to fast. I hate having to clean it so often. You have to beat the filter on something to get out the dust. Its messy. The hose attachment has no suction. It will barely pick anything up.If you have pets do not get this vacuum
1,This deserves NO stars,"First, it was dirty and really beat up. A lot of scratches and all the writing was rubbed off. It looked like I bought it fro $5 at a garage sale and most importantly it doesn't work. I've never seen such a crappy refurbished product. Usually they look like new. This literally looked like you took it out of someone's garbage. I'm really disappointed because it's really not that cheap."
4,"Overall, a good value. A bit more scuffed than I expected, but clean.","I already have a bagless Windtunnel and this one is for basement so I don't have to lug the other one up and down. Works fine, and was clean, but had clear signs of previous use, though it DOES appear that the hose is replaced with a new one during refurb---a good thing. For $50, a good deal."
1,very disappointed,the product's bulb broke in the first try. Clean the stairs is not even as powerful as those $20 ones.
2,not as expected,All the dust comes out of the bagless container. Its pathetic. Would never recommend this product.
1,Reconditioned.... try missing feature!,"I purchased this item because most of the reviews were all good but that was a huge mistake! I did receive it fast but the windtunnel did not have all of the features that the picture and description showed. I called Amazon and they mailed me out another one right away but that too had the same feature missing. Both vacuum's I received had a black ""bag less"" sticker on it (right above the light), the sticker looked out of place so I peeled it back and noticed that there were holes in my vacuum, they were trying to cover up so I went to the site and saw there are supposed to be a red and green light to let you know if the vacuum is clean or dirty ( I think?). The 2nd and 3rd pictures show a close up of this feature..... that was not included in the TWO vacuums' I received. The description says ""Some models may have cosmetic blemishes."" They did not say that they remove any of the features they show to sell the vacuum!!"
1,junk,"Just received this item today, it is pure junk. I wouldn't even start and I had to go through all the hassle of repacking and taking it to the UPS store. The item was also in very poor condition, it had been used a great deal by the looks of the wheels. Very disappointed with Amazon for selling something like this, however, your return policy was very good. Will see how fast the credit back to my account is!"
2,Vacuum sucks at sucking...,"Let me just start by saying the Hoover (when standing while vacuuming) does a decent job on carpets. When it comes to hardwood floor - the hard floor setting is weak. Further, the tools that come with are almost not worth the time. They can't pick up dust unless it's an inch from the mouth. Have to use a separate, older, canister, Hoover to get that job done. Very disappointed..."
1,This vacuum doesn't suck,I am not at all happy with this vacuum. The vacuum has very little suction. I would recomend a dyson.
4,"Would have given 5 stars, but ...","I would have given this 5 stars, but I am not impressed with the adhesiveness of this product. Part of what attracted me to this was the fact that no messy glue was needed and that it was repositionable. I followed the instructions when applying to the wall, but within a few hours it started to peel and then fell off completely. I eventually had to glue it directly to the wall. Now when the day comes that I want to remove it, I'm afraid it may cause some damage to the walls. The picture itself is really great and detailed nicely."
3,"Great Firebird Suite, lousy Rite","Bernstein's 1958 recording of Stravinsky'sRite of Springis probably the greatest performance the work will ever receive on disc. Why Sony has ignored it in its Bernstein/Stravinsky issues of the last two decades in favor of this later 1970s Rite from London is beyond me. That later performance suffers so badly from muddy and distant sound that it's a travesty that Columbia released it in the first place. The Firebird Suite and Prokofiev, on the other hand, are excellent, both musically and sonically. Still, if you're looking for a performance of the Rite, get the 1958 recording instead."
5,Stravinsky,This is the best performance of the rite of spring I ever heard. Quality is also superb. I recommend to buy this album. You will enjoy greatly.
4,Knots Landing,"This was a gift for a friend. As of a few days ago she had not watched any of the shows. However, although I cannot speak for the content, the packaging was most impressive."
5,East Meets West = Healing,"Dr. Shapiro is a practicing psychiatrist and a devotee of yoga meditation. With a deep understanding of the Western path of understanding as a way to deal with painful situations in life and the Eastern path of transcendence, he offers those facing the brutal reality of pain in life step by step instruction on how to regain an inner peace. Dr. Shapiro's work also will help those labeled as mentally ill or emotionally unstable to a deeper awareness of themselves as spiritual souls on a journey.This work is a great resource for people in pain, written by a great soul who understands what it means to feel trapped by and lost in problems that can appear to be unbearable and unsolvable."
5,The hot set up...,If you are looking for great sound and a perfect fit this is it. This is one of many Dynomax cat back systems I have purchased from Amazon. Took less than an hour to remove the old exhaust and install this system. Looks and sounds great with little cabin noise. Best price anywhere and fast shipping saved time and gas money. Plus the Dynomax mail in coupon for this part pushed the price even lower. Thanks Amazon for the great deal!
5,Long live the WONDER STUFF,"This compilation is sensational. It really captures the essence of the Wonder Stuff. I still have a soft spot for 8-Legged Groove Machine, but this is a wonderful compilation. It is sad that they are no longer with us. I saw the band in St. Louis on the Idiot tour and had a blast!!!! Thanks to the stuffies for some great music that will last forever....."
2,Scary Story Blunder,"The stories are classic and fine for kids- except the titles gives the surprise away every time... if you're reading it to them you can just skip the title- or try to if you're reading it for yourself- but the publishing company, if not the author really should have realized how the title ruins it!"
3,good,"i have a pair of thse tweets in my ride and they sound really good n clear.pyramids are alright.make sure you put tape on that passive cap so no contact with ground,or move them off the tweet they are solderd on."
2,What the heck was that?,"I watched some of this. It was pretty, but I had no clue what was going on. As far as I could tell, it's some kind of unstructured performance art."
3,Optic candy,"If you are a fan of random humor and the kind of colors that are meant to be viewed while inibriated, you will love this. It's not quite as erotic as the name implies, but it's fun to watch. Once or twice."
1,Got Junk!! (buy this and you will!),"I bought this thinking I'd see something original. I was only able to sit through 3 or 4 skits before I had to take this DVD out and properly dispose of it.Most of what I saw was subtitled, you can't get to the english audio. The Fuccons, which I thought would be funny was utterly stupid! In the 2nd scene we watch to scantly dressed women poke other women in their bottom with toy hypodermic needles... then watch them scream, and they all put this to a dance tune.Anyways, you might like this if you're 13 or grew up in Japan where you can understand this humor. I found 'Jackass' to be much more entertaining, at least with Jack I was able to wonder just how stupid the participants were, with this DVD, I just can't figure out who was drinking more, the writers, the director or the whole entre cast has too much saki!"
5,Jim Miotkes' book is a must for anyone new to digital photography,"Beautifully illustrated with Jims'photographs it also teaches all of the basics for creating great imagery be it digital or film.I found this book very easy to understand,and extremely helpful,just like his courses at betterphoto.com.I look forward to his next book!"
5,A superb book written with a bit of humor!,"I purchased this book for a digital photography course that I teach. I wanted to evaluate the book for use as a textbook for my students and it is fantastic. It is written in plain English, is very understandable, has great examples, and I am now using it for a digital photography course I teach. It covers all the fundamentals as well as some advanced techniques and is a guide that will serve the amateur owner of a digital camera well."
4,extremely well-written,I have just started learning to use my D80 and this is the best book I've found for the novice . It is written without a lot of jargon and gives simple yet clear descriptions of functions and great illustrations/photos to reinforce the info.
3,Better Photo Guide to Digital Photography,Average Book. The Digital Photograpy book by Scott Kelby ia much better and easier to understand. I bought both books after reading good reviews.
3,The better photo guide to digital photography,"This book is for the serious photographer using the digital equipment. I was interested in learning to take better photographs, and this book made me want to go out there and do the lessons included in there."
5,Best in class,"This book is great. I have recommended it to many people since I first read it back in 2005. I was getting involved with photography again after more than 10 years away from it. I knew I needed to review the fundamentals and learn what the differences were between film, which is where I started as a kid, and digital photography. This book did not disappoint, it is concise, easy to read/understand and assumes the reader knows zip about photography.The best primer I've ever seen and it doesn't matter whether you use a point & shoot or plan to move up to a top of the line Nikon or Canon DSLR someday, the fundamentals are the same and the book covers the features and limitations of all kinds of gear.If there were six stars available for this I would have given it six.Paul StewartHendersonville, Tennessee"
5,Love this book....I can now use manual settings! :),"I bought this book by Mr. Miotke after having my digital SLR for about a month. Even though I took a photography class, this book has been an essential reference for me. I love the fact that I can refer back to certain areas over and over and over....and that I can understand Jim Miotke's description of the sometimes confusing camera language.The book is written clearly, but it moves right along and doesn't over-simplify concepts. It covers the mechanics of photography and then gives great guidelines on composition as well as the differing types of digital formats and what they are best for.It's a well-written book that covers everything you need to start taking great digital photos. Plus, the photos in the book are themselves stunning and are great inspiration! :)"
5,Great beginners book!,"The Better Photo Guide to Digital Photography is an excellent beginners guide to the topic. It is exactly what a person looking to get a better understanding of digital photography needs in a book. It gives a great topical overview of all the steps a beginner will be looking for; it covers the advantages and disadvantages of the different cameral options, beginning looking for subjects, different file formats, understanding exposure and lighting, and basic composition. It is simple and easy to read, it flows nicely, and provides simple assignments to gain a better intuitive understanding of the topics covered. It is clearly meant for photography beginners. Anyone with an intermediate understanding of photography or better will find it to be overly basic, but anyone looking to get into the field of photography will find it is an excellent starting point to move forward from. I highly recommend it to any such person. Happy reading,-Zsen"
5,Diane,"I loved The BetterPhoto Guide to Digital Photography!I wanted to know how to use my camera to its fullest. This book has got me on the way! Getting to know your camera, figuring out what to shoot, exposure, light, composition and all the assignments! I needed this book! I have a better understanding of what my camera can do! Thank you!!"
5,Fantastic Book,Buy this book... content is precise and to the point .... with some great tips... respects the readers intelligence and does not treat one like a 3 year old... I enjoyed reading it a lot. The book has a great re-read value too... Once you are done reading this buy Scott Kelbys Book.
5,excellent book esp if new to digital photography,"I am new to digital photography and I wanted to do some very specific things like photograph upclose jewelry. This book was an immense help. While I am no pro yet it it is divided into specific chapters. So, I got a handle on white balance, bracketing, and closeups that at least is allowing me to feel like I am not completely lost. The book is a great resource so I know I can go back to other sections when I am ready and educate myself more."
5,Look no further!,There is an avalanche of books out there on Digital Photography... but this one does & says it all! If you want to learn more about digital photography... and about the author... check out betterphoto.com It's a great site to belong to (free) to become part of a wonderful photog. community!
3,Decent gloves.,I work outside in all types of weather. I baught these gloves for dealing with heavy lifting in the rain. They do not keep your hand warm at all but do provide decent grip. They are not completely waterproof but do keep a lot more moisture out than other gloves I've had.
2,Not recommended for someone whose hands get cold.,These gloves should keep your hands dry but they will not keep them warm. They were bought as a gift and will be returned as soon as I get them back from the recipient.
4,SealSkinz Gloves,the gloves are great for cool weather - I have really enjoyed them while biking this fall. Great for driving or other activities requiring hand dexterity. Wish there were similar gloves for cold weather biking
1,These gloves suck,"On the description it says these gloves are waterproof but after using them for 3 days, my hands got all wet from it, so basically it's waterproof for 3 days only"
2,not warm enough for above freezing temperatures,Theese gloves did not keep my hands warm in 15 degree F. They stick to velcro and are hard to get loose. Good dexterity.
3,"Looks nice, but needs improvement","I bought this glove for winter water work. I expected these gloves to keep my hands dry and warm. While they did keep water out of the glove, the fabric on the outside retains water so that if the water is freezing cold it acts as an ice pack on your hands! I still use these gloves for driving to keep my hands warm on cold mornings, but I will never submerse them into cold water. I found a better alternative with Spontex Bluettes rubber gloves. They're a lot cheaper, and since the water rolls off, they keep my hands dry and warm."
4,A True Gem!,"I just rediscovered my love for this record, and can't tout it enough. Luomo delivers an album full of soul and sophisticate - his recipe combines the delicious flavors of deep and micro house to create one delightful dish. The result: sheer enjoyment for the ears and the libido. Keep an an eye out for the rerelease of Vocalcity as well - another fabulous record."
4,Luomo - The Present Lover,"The Present Lover, Luomo's second album, ironically, has more vocals than on Vocalcity. Whereas Vocalcity was house placed in outer space, The Present Lover comes crashing down to Earth -- Earth in the mid-80s, no less. There's much more cheeky pop on this new album, as evidenced on the spoken word on ""Talk in a Danger."" The vocals, however, also detract from the album; some lyrics are laughably cheesy (as on the opening track ""Visitor"") and the breathy delivery takes me right back to the time of parachute pants and Members Only jackets. The production is still top-notch, though (""The Present Lover,"" for example), and this album is certainly immediate and accessible. But compare the original ""Tessio"" to the one of The Present Lover and you'll be able to hear the difference. The new version is good; it's just not as good."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Design","Loved the idea of this product and the light is big and bright however the clip does not stay attached to your ears. I've tried it on several different people, man, woman, child and the clip is HUGE and doesn't stay put so it is constantly falling off your ear. I followed instructions, had others try to figure it out, it just doesn't work."
1,Disappointed in outdated version,"I read The Declining Significance of Race when it was first published in the 1980s. There was no indication in the advertisement that this ""update"" also was from the late 1980s. Since then, Professor Wilson has changed his mind and while recognizing desparate economic conditions of the inner city, acknowledges that race plays a major role in African Americans suffering most.The ad was disingenuous and I felt ripped off in my purchase."
3,Nice but not as expected,"A nice calendar but read the dimensions CAREFULLY...10"" X 8""is much smaller than your ""typical"" wall calendar.....wish they would have made it bigger!"
1,Where are the solutions?,"I am most disappointed with this calendar for 3 reasons. One I purchased it from a magazine listing it as problems to practice your math skills for ages 10 and up. There is no way a 10 year old can do any of these problems. Second, it does not point out where the solutions are (they are the day of the month). Thirdly, as another reviewer pointed out, many of the problems are more trivia based rather than mathematical."
3,Why would anyone sell 2011 calendar in 2013 even if Math,"On time, under budget. Very satisfied systems worked as designed.Will not always go with least expnsive but have yet to be diappointed."
5,Keeping my brain sharp!,"I love these calendars. I received one as a gift in 2010 and went through it page by page. I ordered the 2011 from Amazon. I had a stroke in December 2009 and doing the exercises really helped me get back to ""normal"". Thank you!"
3,Basic but helpful.,"There were a few new ideas in the book but overall this is an inexpensive, basic book to help plan your pool."
2,Terrible,"I purchased a new book, and just received a used book with the front cover entirely bended. Also, the book has hand-written notes inside in pen ink."
2,iffy...,"One of my best friends is a huge CLAMP fan, so she convinced me to read this. I read it online and it is simply not the best manga manga i have yet to read. The story line is very bad but the art is good. I have read other CLAMP books and have the same result. If you want something good, read Code Geass. It is much better and CLAMP is involved with it."
3,Testing My Patience,"You might want to see my comments on XXXholic: it gives my general impression of CLAMP in general. I won't repeat myself here.I have not read any of the tie-in books (except for XXXholic, all of the rest were too ""kawaii"" for this otaku), so my impression is of this book alone.My overall impression of this book was favorable. I will probably buy the next book in the series just to find out what happens (damn you, CLAMP! all your attention-span are belong to us!)The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is a nit pick: I didn't like the art in the dimensional travel panels. It was just too chaotic for my taste. Now, there are those who would say ""well,duh, it's interdimensional travel...it's supposed to be chaotic!"" There's chaotic and beautiful, and chaotic and messy. This was chaotic and messy.Fortunately, the travel panels are less than 10% of the book, so if you can wade through the transitions you're going to have a neat story on your hands."
4,MY OPINION MOSTLY ( ONT READ IF U ONT WANT OPINION!),"i disdainfully read this manga when it first came out, which was in japanese. And my Japanese is just as rusty as my Filipino, which is pretty bad to start with. But other than that i just flipped throught the wonderful graphics of CLAMP's extremely detailed artwork and without even knowing the storyline I quickly followed the story through only with my eyes. I began to enjoy the storyline even if I did not get the whole point of the story. Which for me was an advantage and a disadvantage. But all in all this story is a true classic of CLAMP. Mixing many of their other manga characters in with this story and making new ones as well. CLAMP is one of my favorite manga temas and artists, besides from Yu Watase, Yukiru Sugisaki, Oh!Great, etc. But this manga is one of CLAMP's more confusing ones. Enjoy!"
3,Good but totally confusing,"okay, i have to say, this story is pretty good. BUt...... It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO confusing! o_O It's not all bad though, and it's worth reading. It's just not one of my faves."
5,Kawaii desu!,"This is very cute! Sakura and Syaoran are BACK in action! But this time, they're not the same as they were before. There idenities are TOTALLY different! Sakura is a princess and Syaoran is an arceologist! And also in this story here, Fujitaka is NOT Sakura's father but Syaoran's adoptive father (this part you'll have to wait till vol 5 or 6 I got mine in Japanese so it's faster) and in this series, Syaoran is a lot more friendlier and a lot more genki-ish like Sakura. But what I didn't like was the way too dramatic Tomoyo. But it was okay, and it's really sad how Sakura's life was turned into feathers in the snap of a finger.1) Arts great2) Dialoge- So, so3) Plot interestingSo if you're still pondering why you should get this, you better just give in and get it anyways. It's really good! It's a must-have in teh CLAMP shoujo manga category!AznPiez"
2,Sequel to cardcaptor sakura.,"I really enjoyed Cardcaptor Sakura, and was extremely happy to find, they had created more series with Sakura and Li-Kun.......Only to be extremely disappointed. CLAMP is made up of 4 manga artists each with their own styles. Sakura and Li-Kun were obviously drawn by a different artist than in Cardcaptor-Sakura and Li-Kun are drawn in a different style. What happened to the cutesy little characters?This sweetly drawn series has been disrupted into this roughly drawn full-on ""action"" thing.However, for those like myself who really enjoy this series, I continue to sadly plow on through, wishing that someone else could share my opinion and have someone from CLAMP draw the whole series into that cutesy ""Anyone""-rated series."
2,not THAT good,Hi my name is nick I'm a new fan of manga i have only read about 7 so far and I already love them and will keep reading the till the day i die lol. I heard from my 17 yr. old friend desiree who is obsessed with manga and got me into it that clamp were good writers i agree i enjoyed this manga but it is to short it doesn't explain much about the character's and seems rushed and we are left at a cliffhanger which i hate cuz i want to keep reading also there is just romance even though it is labeled as adventure the adventure starts about 5 pages before it was done and it wasn't really funny either. but the artwork and plot were good I just hope volume 2 is better.
5,Su..goi!!!!,"CLAMP is one of my favorite manga-ka, and I love to see how their style evolves over time. The character and surrounding design of this particular one is SO beautiful, it almost trumps the previous stories. Not only is the art phenomenal, the story line had me hooked faster then any of their other ones, just the right amount of drama, action, and character development made for a very enjoyable read. The constant previous character references are really fun too; I've read most of the manga CLAMP refers to and they tend to retain the majority of the original character; the X ones are the funniest.The publishers of this title have done a really awesome job; I enjoy the fact that there is extensive explanation of the character references and ....AND...!!!...a preview of the next book in japanese!! Now I know what's going to happen next :)"
1,sent me a lens cap instead - twice,"Hopefully the issue is fixed by now, but I ordered this lens hood when I lost mine. Twice, I got a lens cap and had to return it at my ow expense.ALSO, THE 100mm ""L"" LENS SHIPS WITH A HOOD IN THE BOX. YOU ONLY NEED THIS IF YOU LOSE YOURS."
4,Gentle Fitness,This workout met my expectation. It is gentle enough for me to accomplish wwith RA and Lupus.
3,BigDave,This product looks nice when first purchased and seemed to be fairly sturdy. But after storing thru the winter months we attempted to reassemble and a couple of the fiberglass poles broke which pretty much rendered it useless.
4,End times? - what about now?,"If your favorite place is the couch, with TV remote in hand, do not read this book; Hon's down to earth exposition of The Revelation will be a danger to your peace of mind. Hon shows that God's plans for the future do not involve Christians sitting comfortably in the Corporate Box watching the game with free coke and hot dogs. In fact it seems that God expects us to be sweating it out on the playing field, wearing his team colours. This book will assist anyone wanting to be a useful player on God's team as it provides motivation, an understanding of what the goals are and will help you to identify and overcome the opposition."
2,Little practical information,Developing Online Games: An Insider's Guide is worth reading if you are making an MMOG because the cost of admission is low relative to the cost of making an online game. I know this because of the three useful facts presented in the book:MMOGs are expensive to makeMMOGs require expensive support and development after launchMMOGs are complexYou probably knew this already though - in which case you would be wondering why you should buy the book? The answer is that the book drills these facts into your head through repetition over 500 pages. If you plan to spend 20 million to make an MMO it's good to get these facts clear.If you were looking for practical information from which to build an MMO you won't much in this book. While the the technical reviewer's qualifications are strong the authors have only worked in management positions.Developing Online Games wasn't useful to me as a developer but producers and managers should pick up a copy.
1,absolute JUNK!,"bad steel, rusted all over just after having been splashed with sink water;sheath is unusable with one single hand (i.e. can't release the knife without serious juggling); also, sheath is terribly uncomfortable if diving without a full suit."
5,best dies for the money,a must with a lee press the powder through die frees up time and makes filling cases way easy so very much worth the money
3,rusty spikes,I bought four of these traps. They wwork great. The only problem is the spikes are starting to rust. They must be made of steel. They are a little more heavy duty than the Sweeney's 9011 mole traps but the Sweeney's mole traps have stainless steel spikes that won't rust.
5,Works Great,The moles are gone and I've tried everything. This isthe only way to get rid of them and it's real easy to use.
5,Determination,"I've used this type of trap before, 'Have not caught the little devil yet. It seems Florida moles are a bit smarter than the Northern variety. The trap will eventually do the job, just have to get the mole to go through the gate and not around it."
1,Don`t do it!,"If I had it to do over again,I would not purchase these traps.Do not get me wrong,they are as shown and do work,but wish I had spent the money on poison worm bait instead,they work better,quicker,and much,much easier..."
4,Lao Tzu & Janet2,I am a student of history and enjoyed this book. It gives a real good look at behind the scene at political manipulation on a national level and you can draw comparisons to the present administration.
5,Superb!,"Mr. Doty produced a thoroughly researched, accurately transcribed, and readable genealogical historical research of several interconnected families. Highly recommended!"
3,"Is Good, but not Very Good","The book if fine for novice and medium users in simulation. Very pages with same example or topic, expensed, really few contents.There are not numerical methods, integration with event models or process models, cibernetic vision, complex problems, visual simulations, business data minning, control theory, business theory, etc.Therefore, if you need to know simply small business systems simulations with only equations differential modeling, this is the book for to begin."
4,"Good book, but could be better ...........","This book is a must for anyone with interest in business modeling and simulation. It is the culmination of Forrester's seminal book on System Dynamics + the 40 odd years maturation that has occured in this discipline since 1961.Though this book with 900 odd pages is large, it could have been useful if it had at least one serious case study which flowed through all the chapters and linked all the concepts. This would have helped potential practioners. In its current form the book contains many examples to explain the concepts, but none detailed enough. Many a times the author mentions that the actual models were complex, and a simplified version is being shown in the book. This however does not help the reader to understand and appreciate the complexities involved. It is probably because the concerned organizations were not willing to reveal ""too much"" lest they loose their IP."
2,Poor quality metal,"The following is my personal opinion.Inconsistent quality:- 2 punches got dull after just a few usages on aluminum. Surprisingly, this issue was not correlated with the thickness of a particular punch.- The rest seem to be holding up. However, I am not sure what will happen should I move to steel.One more thing, I am quite familiar how to use these, so no, I was not using them as a center punch, just for a light tap to mark the center. Then I'd use a tungsten spring-loaded center punch to make a dent."
4,kono namida hoshini by ZARD,The music is unique for a female jpop singer. Very refreshing change from the mainstream. A cd which comes with the karaoke for each song is a great selling tool for a cd.
4,guide book,This tour book was very helpful to me and arrived in excellent condition. I was pleased with the quick delivery time as it gave me time to prepare for our trip. Glad I ordered it.
4,Nice book,Books that helps investor to improve. The book is really valuable to investor that wish to improve their investment knowledge.
5,Read Book = Make Money,"Shortly after WWII, Benjamin Graham wrote this book. If there was only one book I could recommend you read on investing, it would be this one. This was one of the first investment books I read myself and I understood it. My second read of it revealed even more. It is fairly long, but with an understanding of all the concepts in this book, you could invest in individual stocks with success. I prefer the edition with a forward by Warren Buffett and chapter by chapter commentary by Jason ZweigThe Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing. A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition). It will help you apply Graham's principals to today's economy."
5,Buy this original 1949 edition !,"I noticed that the original edition has fewer comments (32 comments) compared to the 1973 edition (197 comments). I strongly urge investors to buy this original 1949 edition !The 1949 edition includes a very interesting introduction by John C. Bogle. I am confident that most value investors are not aware of the substantial change in Benjamin Graham's technical view towards stock portfolio formation in 1976. Check it out and buy the original edition !Look also on the internet for the following three interviews if you want to learn more about Benjamin Graham's substantial change towards stock selection in the mid 70's:A conversation with Benjamin Graham, Financial Analysts Journal, 1976An Hour with Mr. Graham, Financial Analysts Journal, 1976The Simplest Way to Select Bargain Stocks, Medical Economics, 1976"
4,Useful anywhere on the planet !,I am a brazilian investor and this classic text helped me the change my attitude when the subject is the capital market.
1,The intelligent Investor: The classic text on value investing,I'm very disappointed with this book not for the content that was being written but by the outlook of the book. How could the publisher even allows book that was so badly cut in pages out on the shelves or to the hands of the consumer? The edges of my book pages seems to be cut by some really blunt paper cutter!
4,I Like This One The Best,"Out of all the editions of this book commonly available I have to admit liking this one the best. It is the original Graham unfiltered by Warren Buffett or anyone else. There is some great advice in the book but much of it is available elsewhere these days and much of it many experienced investors understand only too well after recent adventures in the stock market. It is worth noting, however, that despite all the hype about Graham's being a buy and hold kind of guy, the book contains a Dow Jones timing strategy that the author thought the public might find useful in timing their sales and purchases of stocks.Anyhow, those wanting to hear this advice from the horse's mouth will enjoy this book better than the other editions."
5,A classic -- still worth reading after 60 years,"Since reading Graham, I keep running into his name everywhere -- and for good reason. Graham (and his disciple Warren Buffet) does not talk about -- or believe in -- get-rich-quick schemes (those are speculation), but in sound principles of looking for solid, well-run companies, and buying their stock when the price dips. (The market gets hysterical and goes up or down in ways that have nothing to do with the intrinsic value of the company.) If other people are foolish enough to sell off a good company at a bargain price, there's nothing wrong with being smart enough to go against the market and buy a bargain. If you want to invest but don't know how to do it intelligently, read Ben Graham for starters."
5,An Excellent Resource,"I attend a parish where the Novus Ordo Missae (1970) is celebrated in Latin, using the chants from the Graduale Romanum.This book is geared to facilitate the singing of Mass with Gregorian chant. The book contains the Order of Mass in Latin and English, with the chants for the responses, settings for the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus-Benedictus, and Agnus Dei, and the chants for the Sundays and major Holy Days. The Latin texts of the chants are all set with Gregorian chant notation. However, there is no explanatory or devotional material included in the book. Scripture readings (and their lectionary cycles) are cited but not included.Having the original Latin prayers side-by-side with the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL) ""translation"" is alone worth the price of the book! Readers who can read Latin will be able to judge the ICEL's work for themselves."
4,Great resource,This is a great resource for anyone wanting to know or use the propers for Sundays throughout the year. Many won't ever hear these sung at Mass but now you can at least put them in your hands and receive the benefits of their richness. You can even use this as a Sunday Missal and not a choir book. It may even spark conversation after Mass which would help spread knowledge and use of Chant.

3,beowulf review,"By reading Beowulf I came across many interesting themes. The one that strikes me the most odd is the hints towards Beowulf's sexual preference. Throughout the epic, Beowulf is always surrounded by his ""men"", there are no mentions of women that Beowulf is involved with. Another example of Beowulf's homosexuality is when he and a friend went swimming together in the ocean. The unlearned reader may think that this was just a competition to see who could swim the farthest. But if read more carefully you can see that they were just frolicking in the water together. Along with many other examples given throughout the epic, the advanced reader is able to infer Beowulf's homosexuality."
1,Poor Quality... Misleading Picture,"This item is complete garbage as the swatter fell apart after a few uses (the handle broke off the swatter). Don't think that this product being wire mesh makes it sturdier or better quality than the common plastic swatter as the wire used is very flimsy, almost like fabric. Additionally the picture used to sell this item has a box of two swatters when in reality you only receive one swatter. I have brought the misleading picture to the attention of the seller and they have chose not to correct issue."
3,Thomas fan,"The toy is exactly how it looks. What I don't like is that althoug it has a magnet ""to collect the trains that brake"" there is no way of properly use it. The crane is not created to be able to grab the train using the magnets that the crane and the trains have. So my child have to put the trains in the bed manually. The rest is OK"
4,Really Solid Book,"I have been playing off and on for nearly ten years. I know a good deal of music theory, but not playing much it was mostly abstract and useless to me. This book provided a solid method of learning what I needed to become a more useful player when my true musician friends get together for a jam. The examples were good and quite entertaining. I have only two gripes: the CD is just awful. While the examples are good, the tiny, brash, unappealing guitar accompanied by Dr. Rhythm drums makes otherwise interesting progressions sound terrible. My second gripe is that there is no discussion of chord selection. The book presents two ""turnarounds"" and then significantly modifies them throughout the book without once explaining why or how.Nonetheless, this is definitely one of the best ""how-to"" music books I've seen."
5,complete and great,"I wish I've bought this book before. Finally a book you can start from scratch and build up rhythm technique to create grooves and songs.One of the great things here is that you learn to count music beats in differents styles to creat fun, and flawless rhythms. The variety of musical styles at first seemed like it would miss the point, but it actually helped me upgrade my musical vocabulary. And it is good because of the method used in the book - The first guitar book with a learning system that finally helps me.Way better than "" Complete rhythm guide to blues bands"", "" ""rhythm guitar by steve trovato"", ""Complete rhythm guitar guide"", and others I own.The DVD that comes along is direct, cristal clear, unlike the majority of video guitar lessons.Not all Progressive books are good, but most of them are really amazing."
2,"""tween"" size is misleading","I purchased this for my 5 year old son hoping that he would get several years out it with all the traveling we do. If you are purchasing this for a child to play with or use while watching TV it would probably be ok. However, it is VERY narrow and does not allow for tossing and turning during sleep. My son is tall for his age and this sleeping bag is no longer than any other children's bag. He only slept in it once because he kept waking up everytime he needed to turn over. I was also disappointed in the ""pump"" that was included. It is a foot pump that takes about 15 minutes to pump it up to a comfortable thickness. By the time I was finished I felt like I had been on a hike.I finally invested in an inflatable twin mattress with an electric pump that is working out great."
4,Kids Liked It,"My two boys liked the Tween Ready bed. They were tired of sleeping in sleeping bags on the hard floor for sleep overs or a weekend in the livingroom. My oldest son's only complaint was that the beds are to skinny. There isn't much room to move or turn over, otherwise they are fine."
4,Pretty nice product.,"This item was fairly easy to figure out. The foot pump kept coming out of the air mattress as I was blowing it up, so I had to hold it with my hand as I pumped with my foot. We already had a battery operated air pump at home and using that instead made it much easier to inflate. Otherwise, it didn't take long to get it going and my son slept in it the first night we had it."
3,Disappointment,"In general, I love picture books. I expected to enjoy this one, based on the reviews. Instead, I found it weak, shallow, silly, and obvious. It is very much the sort of book that is written by people who think children are less intelligent than adults. Are there worse books for children? Sure, especially anything that involves counting insects or flowers. But there are also excellent picture books. Keep looking until you find something more substantial to read with your children."
2,Great show...on video poorly,"The great PBS kids show on video with several releases now. BUT the videos are all EP/SLP mode...shame on them. Why not SP the quality of the video and audio is horrible, such a shame to do this to a great kids TV show."
3,"A show so bad, it's almost offensive.","I gave it 3 stars just because of my daughter, aged 4. She loves it, can't get enough, probably learns all sorts of niceness from it. I admit that. I, on the other hand, am repeatedly irritated by its insipid characters, creatures, stories and blatant bleeding-heart preachy-ness. As if that wasn't annoying enough, there's the animation. I haven't seen anything so unnatural since... Well, there's quite a few freaky cartoons around but this one is actually trying to be good animation and it's failing. The artists need to go back to school and learn a little basic physics and anatomy. Other shows have been able to get away with having animators who are obviously incompetent by having wit or charm in the story, many of them kids' shows, but this one doesn't have what it takes."
5,Movie was perfect,"The DVD was exactly what was described. No scratches, brand new, perfect. I watched it right away and loved it =) thanks."
3,Need a sense of humor,The movie leads one to believe that only Mexicans can do those types of things that were not done while they were gone. But truth is it focuses on our insecurities about Mexicans. They are part of our culture and are very hard workers willing to do what needs to be done to feed their families. I am Portuguese and have a daughter who is half Mexican so we watched and talked about it after it was over. We know that this is just a movie and not real life.
4,"We need them, but we don't see them!","A satire on California's dependence on the Mexican labor population. Mysteriously all Mexicans disappear from southern California and chaos ensues. The USA born citizens, accustomed to the Mexican laborer are overwhelmed at the fact that now nothing is being done by ""free"" labor and finds him/herself struggling to get through the day. Did the Mexicans really disappear-- or is it that while there--no one sees them? Or have they really left!! Thought provoking film, yet a spoof on USA/California vision of reality! A Must See for all dealing with Hispanic populations."
3,"Tries to prove a point, but fails.","The big mistake ADWAM made was turning it into a mockumentary. Super size me was serious, but still funny. This is just doppey. The problem is there, and it makes some really good points, but the story is so far fetched ir's lame."
1,Title and Cover Deceiving,"I expected this movie to be totally hilarious. Throughout the movie there is mostly nothing but newscast of the missing mexicans in california. Yes, once or twice you may grunt a little ha, but that's about it. The ordeals people go through when they have to take on the tasks of the mexican workers are not funny. I was very disappointed with this movie. Don't buy it!"
1,Terrible movie,"I very much looked forward to this movie when I rented it, the synopsis sounded great. In reality it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In the first place, no one ever explains where the fog came from that took the Latinos away, nor do they ever explain where the fog went to when the Latinos came back.I can appreciate that the makers of this movie wanted to stress the importance of the Latino community in California, but this movie became far too preachy and I was so bored most of the time that I had trouble staying awake.I want my money back from having rented this atrocity, but more then that, I want the hour and a half of my life that I wasted on this movie back!"
1,One of the alltime snorers,"Probably one of the most boring meaningless movies ever. I had to keep getting up and pacing to stay awake. I was looking for the humor in this, but it never appeared. Not only was the acting bad, it was pitiful. The writing was even worse. A complete waste of money."
5,A Day without a Mexican: try it if you're against illegals,"Having grown up in Texas, I could understand the situation in California. In the movie (which is a romp), the governor succeeds in a law restricting immigration. The result is chaos: there is no one to pick fruits and vegetables, so there are food riots at the grocery stores. The Hispanic teachers disappear, so the schools have to close. There are no more maids... do the math. But it's really witty. We are a bilingual nation, and should have agreements with all Latino countries.-Anne Ladd"
1,"Amatuerish, boring ,artsy farty indie crap!!","Well that's 10 bucks and 35 minutes of my life I'll never get back. What a god awful piece of crap. This movie sucked. and not even a ""campy"" bad sucked. it's like ""artsy fartsy indie"" sucked.I was hoping for a carlos mensia(sp?) esque funny, mock-u-mentary about what would happen if the west coast was without mexicans for a day. instead it's this really lame psudeo sci-fi plot filmed by a guy with 10 grand, 20 friends, and a digital camera. it's so boring that i literally gave up on it 35 minutes in. that's sad!i urge all west and southern based hispanics to move to the east coast and actually be seen as a real human being instead of this slapstick novelty they seem to be labeled as in the south and the west. jeeeeeze!"
3,Jar,the movie was some how slow delivering the message. it could have been better. funny at times.. look out.
1,"waste of dvc, time, and money","The idea of showing the California gringos what a day without a Mexican would be like is great. However, this was a complete waste of a good idea. Like other reviewers on this site, I want my rental money and 90 minutes of my life back...oh, snap.. the fog must have kept it."
1,Great story idea.... poor execution.,"The whole concept is ""What would life be like in California if all the Hispanics disappeared?"" Sounds like the beginning of a great movie, but the way it is carried out it becomes quite hokey... dumb. For some unexplained reason, a fog disappears all hispanics, blocks all the state lines, and stops all intrastate communications, including satellites. (Of course, power, water, gasoline and other essentials which are heavily piped into the state in unaffected.)The storyline also becomes pretty silly. I hope some real director takes this story, feeds it to some better screenwriters and re-makes the movie... so it makes sense."
1,horrible,"no story line, good concept but the movie made no sense was very disappointed, was told it was funny but I did not get any laughs from it."
3,Review of a day without a Mexican,Attempted insight to how people would feel if all the Mexicans disappeared. Since it was made in the 70's it was poorly filmed. It is a light hearted film with the point of creating sympathy for Mexicans that immigrate and live in the US. Enjoyable for a 3 star rating but no higher.
1,A day without an anglo,"I'm sorry but this movie is so insulting to non-Latinos. The premise is annoying. I've lived in California since the 70's and believe me, it did run before 10 million Mexicans came here. I realize I'm not commenting on the merits of the film, but oh well...Update: 2009 - Well, now that the economy has failed, 'La Dia Sin Mexicanos' has arrived. Guess what, life's continuing, my only problem being that there is so much less traffic. But then, I do all my own gardening, cleaning, etc. like 95% of other Californians."
1,"If you can watch for free, it's still not worth it.","Rented this at a video store. The cover looked like it'd be fun. The description on the back was promising. Sat down to watch it, and it was a bad news-report-style movie, slow, bad acting, no plot -- maybe I missed it as I fast-forwarded through to try and find something worth watching."
1,Straight to the trash can.,"All the ingredients for a bad movie...Horrible acting, sterotypes, stale plot, sad attempt at humor, and one-sided political message.I'm tired of hearing about the plight of the Mexicans. There are millions of American CITIZENS who live paycheck to paycheck, can't find employment, don't have health care, get on their knees to scrub toilets, etc. Instead, the mexicans, who come here ILLEGALLY think that we have to just hand them citizenship for no good reason because they can get here easily by jumping over a fence.The movie portrays all white american citizens as rich, useless, dont know how to cook, clean or do their own laundry. Personally in my life time I have never had any friends or family who had a maid. This movie is just lame, dont waste your time..no matter what side of the immigration issue you are on, this movie is lame."
1,Rubbish PC nonsense,"This film is a load of ridiculous political correctness. It is thoroughly one-sided. It mentions that if the Mexicans suddenly went, many Americans would have to do work for themselves. However, they don't appear to have considered that most of LA's police force would be out of work because of the collapse in crime rates resulting from the gangster population plummeting. They also don't mention that the cost of running the school system would drop, as they would no longer have to run many bilingual schools. They also don't mention that taxes would drop because of the lack of benefit scroungers: - I may remind the readers that California is having a budget crisis.This film is cliched and one-sided. Don't bother."
2,Interesting,"Interesting idea, but the movies was too slow.I really wanted to find out what the outcome was, so I just fast-fowarded to the end."
1,"Pathetic, 1 1/2 hours wasted from my life","this is my first review ever, I couldn't pass it up, since i was really mad after watching this crap. Doesn't even deserve one star. There's 1 1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Pathetic, pitiful, boring, stupid, big infomercial why americans especially Californian shouldn't complain about mexicans being in Cali. that they are needed. I thought the movie would at least be funny, i kept watching hoping for something, nada nada nada... thank god i have free rentals, all else i would have been really mad if I even paid a penny to watch it, i would have demanded it back... satirical my shoe, the movie is stupid, sorry, it isn't even a movie... anyways, don't waste ur time... and i have sat thru many late night movie on showtime that amounted to nothing, but i honestly would say, the most boring thing i ever watched..."
1,DO NOT WATCH THIS !!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I ever seen in my life! I think that the only good movie that Arau has made was ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and probably only cause his wife back then wrote the book, other wise he pretty much sucks!"
2,A Day Without a Mexican,"The movie covered an interesting subject, but I believe it did not go deep enought into the situation. I guess budget constraints prvented a more thorough and interesting presentation of the movie content. The DVD that I received through Amazon was processed quickly and without problems. I like the prices I get through Amazon and the efficient way they deliver my purchases."
3,A Light Touch,"This film takes a humorous approach to giving valuable information about immigrants, particularly in California. It's ""mocumentary"" style parodies American news broadcasting, police, government conspiracy theories, UFOs and other familiar elements of US culture. At the same time it works to provide images of Hispanics in the US beyond the stereotypical ones and sprinkles intesting statistics throughout."
5,This is a wonderful tool!,"""Just the tips, man"" is a must for computer users of all levels. I have been using computers daily for many years and find myself refering to my copy of Just the tips, man for Microsoft Word 2000 at least several times every week. The more I use it the more productive I become!I've recently given a copy to my 70 year old father who is just learning how to get around in the different office packages. Learining some quick tricks and shortcuts has really boosted his confidence. Thanks Wendy & Bob for a great product!"
2,Not what I wanted,"I found the booklet awkward to use, and written in an irritating and patronizing 1960's ""hip"" style. I was hoping for something straightforward but the authors seemed more intent on showing off their cleverness than in helping someone struggling with a complex machine. It was also overpriced. The cartoons were kind of cute but if I want a cartoon book I'll buy a copy of ""Peanuts""."
4,Watercolor books,"I find these Splash series to be of great help in formulating my own painting style. The artists' commentary on their own work is thought provoking, as well as beautiful and inspirational."
5,We were unable to put it down,As former residents of Pekin with close ties to Tremont everyone in our household has been enchanted by this book. We have all spent several hours looking at this marvelous collection of post cards. The memories that each card brings are priceless. The notes by the author bring each card to life. This book is well worth owning and we are so pleased that we found it.
5,This is an awesome speed bag reference.,I'm knew to the speed bag and don't have a trainer to show me the proper way so I thought that this book would be a great way to good technique so I wouldn't have to fix and correct it later.I've only had it for a few days but I can tell that it has already improved on what I was doing. I'd highly recommend it.
3,"Too tight for 13.3"" Macbook","Although it was made specifically for the Macbook, the laptop sleeve was too tight for the machine. Rather than ""slipping"" the sleeve around my Mac it felt like I was trying to fit spandex leggings onto my Mac. I like the design and color of the sleeve, so I will go for the 13"" PC-equivalent of the Case Logic shuttle."
4,"Good padding, good enclosure, mediocre pocket","I'm not sure what I would do differently with the top-side pocket, other than possibly stiffening it, but putting anything in there seems to make it bulge and become unwieldy. Some internal straps might work as well; placing the MacBook's power adapter in the pocket means that the pocket's contents can shift around, increasing the likelihood that you'll drop the laptop."
5,Chadwick's best,"I LOVED this book. It had a bit of everything - romance, adventure, history. A definite recommendation."
4,Another Great Book by this Author,I am an avid reader of Elizabeth Chadwick's books. Her ability to present Mediaeval history in the form of entertaining and informative reading is par excellence. The Champion is another story set in the Royal Court in the 13th century Normandy and England. It was shortlisted for the Best Romantic Novel of the Year Award. The term Romantic Novel does not do her work justice as her books are so well researched and her later works became more biographical/historical. I have read almost all of her books. Elizabeth Chadwick is an excellent writer.
5,#1- If you read one book read THE CHAMPION,"This is a wonderful book that tells the epic story of a young man that leaves the monistary he is put in and joins the tourney court with his brother and ends up a knight with a son and a wife that is happy that the father of her son is ""home."" Even though I am only 14 this was a great book I belive and I would recomend it to anyone. It has a great plot and it combines romance, history, adventure, and human ethics to make a briliant tale of a knight and his strugle through life and the strugle of those who he encounters. This was the first book I ever read all the way through, in previous grades i would read books asigned and i would skip chapters or just read the back and ""wing"" the test. This book kept me on the ""edge"" of my ""seat."" I read this book for a week straight, I only stoped to eat or go to the bathroom. If you read one book this week, this year, or even in your life it should be this."
2,Written in Crayon,"I knew I was in trouble after the first five pages when a camp follower is termed ""a minx"" and a few lines later we hear about her ""undulating bosom."" OK. So this is not going to be a serious work of historical fiction. That expectation being out of the way, I was still able to enjoy what is a very plot-driven narrative for the sheer pace of it. Forget about character development; that is not a matter of interest for Ms. Chadwick, at least not in this work. If I were 16, I would have loved this book. It has all the standard romantic fiction stereotypes, no more poorly drawn than in any other book of its ilk. What it does not have is anything resembling a depiction of real people, of that time or any other. We are dealing with the cartoonish here. If that works for you, by all means read this book. If you are looking for historical fiction for grown ups - this is not it."
3,"ok quality, expensive","found pretty much the same set on another fairly known hardware website, but $30 (40%) cheaper. both are made in China of the high speed steel, so not sure what the mark up is for ... grizzly brand? also, the actual stand is different from the one on the picture (3 tin plates screwed together). it came bent. anyway, the tools will do the work, so no complaint there, but an aftertaste of a rip-off still persists"
2,"Very Chalky Tasting, yuck!","My nutritionist recently put me on a protein shake meal replacement diet, so I've been trying a lot of different protein powders lately. I bought several different kinds to try, including Aria's Vanilla flavored Women's Protein Powder. Aria's protein powder is by far the worst one I've tried, it has a weird chalky texture that none of the other powders have. I much prefer EAS and GNC's protein powders."
1,I will never buy again,"I usually get the vanilla flavored Aria from Trader Joe's, so I figured this would be ok, to try something new. Chocolate does not blend well. The chocolate sank to the bottom even through i blended it repeatedly. So I even tried to used a shaker with a shaker ball, it would not blend. I will never buy chocolate again. I truly love the vanilla and have been using it for years."
1,Not good at all.,"This stuff was shockingly gross. I've had a lot of protein shakes and this one was not good. I know that taste is subjective but this was really not for me. It was very chalky and gritty. It didn't matter if I made it with water, milk, or soy milk. It came out the same every time. It had almost a hay like taste to it. I purchased it originally because it's non-gmo and more natural that many of the other shakes out there. But who cares if it's better for you if you can't even stomach it?"
4,Enjoy this Protein Powder,"I really enjoy this protein powder. I mix it with soy or rice milk and take it mid morning. I've tried it with water, but it doesn't taste as well. What I like best is that it is low in fat and sugar."
3,"Next Proteins Aria, Chocolate","It's okay but not great. I like the vanilla much better. I ordered this to make my protein shake chocolate with peanut butter, by adding a spoonful of PB of course. It didn't turn out as tasty as I had hoped. So now I use it just plain with almond milk and like I said it's okay but not great. I probably won't order again, I'll stick with the vanilla I can get locally."
4,Really Good,"The only other protein shake I have tried is Shakeology, which is wonderful. I just can't afford the $120.00 plus that it costs. I saw this one at the store and it was on sale, so I bought it. It is definatley not as good as Shakeology, but I don't dislike it. I mix just one scoop (not the two it recommends) with 1 banana, 1 cup of Almond milk and a handful of ice. I drink it after my morning workouts and it is wonderful. I look forward to it and have even used it as a meal replacement."
1,Gross,Was ok with the vanilla flavor so I tried the chocolate - not good. It's so hard to find a chocolate powder that actually tastes good!
3,"Good info, but a very odd book","This book is a very odd duck, as they say.Karl Roebling is obviously not a historian, or at least not a writer of history. The first thing you'll note about this book is that it is not the normal history book - it is full of exclamation points, and devoid of citations (footnotes and the like), which he explains in his Acknowledgements.That said, his points are true and valid - he presents 14 Myths about WW2, starting with ""that war news gave a true picture"" and ending with ""that the bombing of Germany wasn't effective"". It includes my own personal favorite: ""That the western allies, including the US, defeated Germany.""I recommend it for its message, but it will offend many due to its casual writing style. It is not a scholarly work, though I don't argue with his points."
2,Fair to Middlin',"Can't say this is all that great. Pretty standard stuff for Jackson, but ok for a newbie. Could have been better written and some expert advice would have helped. Not exactly authoritative."
2,Overblown,"Jackson's ego is so overinflated that true knowledge of beer is obscured by his presence. This book is boring, silly, and a waste of money. It is also, like its author, shockingly overrated."
5,Great overview of beer styles,"Most of Jackson's other books are organized by region, shopping guides country-by-country. What makes this book particular useful is is attention to various beerstyles, with history and definition for each, along with listings of the classic examples. It's also a gorgeous book, with mouth-watering photos of beer and the geography of beer.On another note, it's interesting that the only ""reviews"" that dismiss Jackson as a hack are unsigned. No e-mail addresses, just ""a reader"". Makes you wonder, doesn't it?--Jeff Frane"
5,simple yet profound,"This book represents all the simple yet profound facts and loop holes in every one's thinking.And as the title suggests thoroughly argues that a man always becomes what he thinks .As with the other books of James Allen this one also makes the reader think about what's said in the book, even months after reading it.Caution: can instantly change the way you think.I would recommend this book to anyone who is down or stressed , and good thing is its not going to take more than couple of hours to complete it."
4,a must read for every individual with a mind,What a fantastic helpful simple book - really helps you wade through the jargon of typical self help books and get away from marketing it is the instruction book on the mind...easy to read and excellent to keep and read over and over..
3,Not bad but not Barker's best,"In the Flesh consists of four short stories: In the Flesh, The Forbidden, The Madonna, and Babel's Children. The first two stories mentioned are well-written horror stories. The story In the Flesh makes this read worth it, by far the best of the four, fans of the Books of Blood will once again recognize the saying: ""The dead have highways,"" only in this story the reader sees where those highways lead to. The Forbidden though a clever ghost story was also disappointing, primarily if the reader has seen the film ""Candyman"" prior to reading the story. The Madonna and Babel's Children were probably the weakest and most disappointing stories, not horror and not as imaginative as one would expect from Barker."
5,A perfect introduction to the world of Clive Barker.,"For those who are unfamiliar with his work, I've found that this book is an incredible introduction to the world of Clive Barker. It is more than just come spooky stories. Rather, each story stretches the limits of your imagination and forces you to question your personal perception of reality. I haven't found a book that gave me the shivers this much since Stephen King's Salem's Lot."
5,Your nightmares made flesh,"""In The Flesh"" was the inspiration for ""Candyman,"" which drew upon the bloody Mary legend. Clive Barker is truly inventive."
5,What's wrong with the U.S.?,"One of the reasons why I feel lucky to be Canadian is that we get a lot of the best that both the U.S. (because of our proximity) and Europe (because of our closer cultural ties) have to offer. Because of this, all 6 volumes of Clive Barker's Books of Blood were availabe here under that title instead of half inexplicably being given a different title, with the original cover paintings by Clive Barker, and all have been largely available here either in the original six volumes or in 2 trade paperbacks reprinting #1-3 and #4-6 respectively.I am sure that if enough fans in the U.S. put in the effort, the american publishers could be convinced to release the whole series as it should be in the U.S. It is worth the trouble. When I first read them 15 years ago they were the best horror stories I had ever read, and I still love them."
4,Little known history,This story brings to light the pioneering (and to this point little know Jewish) life on the early American prairie.
2,Boring.,Well I have found with Claudia Dain's book I either love them or hate them. I thought this book might be one I loved but I found it boring. It took me days to read it and I had to force myelf to get through it. The characters didn't really have much interest in each other. The hero didn't seem like there was much passion in him at all. The passion that supposedly drove them apart in the first place seemed like it never exsisted. I found the characters boring and without much depth. I'm sorry but I just didn't like this book at all.
1,Completely boring and lacking in every way,"Repetitive, pushes obvious details over and over again. Very unimaginative, the characters lack passion and its hard to show any compassion for them as well. I wanted to rip my hair out trying to readthis boring yarn! Ugh..."
1,"Smell my armpit, wench!","That's what the name of this impossibly bad romance novel should have been titled based on the odd cover art. A ridiculous plot and bizarre writing make for one laugh after another, but I don't think this was supposed to be comedy."
1,This was absolute torture,"In my quest to add new authors to my list (that includes Susan Elizabeth Philips, Shannon McKenna, Lori Foster etc) I purchased this book - much to my chagrin. This book was overwhelmed with heavy desciptions and what I thought was an attempt to be poetic (or something!) The characters were so silly I wanted to hold them by the lapels and shake them! The book dragged and dragged until I could take it no longer - it was absolutely BORING and it made no sense most of the time. I pushed myself to finish it and then promptly exchanged it for a more intelligent read. Please please do yourself a major favour and avoid this book like the plague... if I could have given a negative star I would have. Ugh."
5,A great read aloud!,"This is a great read aloud for any age. I read it to my sixth graders and my third graders and both classes loved this book. David Shannon has done it again. In this book he teaches a lesson of knowing who we are and not following the crowd. The main character, Camilla Cream is worried about what to wear the first day of school, as she has so many friends to impress. After trying on forty-two outfits she looks in the mirror and screams. She has broken out with a bad case of stripes. This is a hillarious story of what Camilla has to go through with her case of stripes. Davis Shannon's illustrations add so much to the story. The cover itself will attract readers. I have decided that David Shannon is my new favorite author and illustrator. I highly recommend this book."
5,A Stripey Tale,"My kids adore this book! They just love hearing about Camilla Cream. The story is great, the moral is wonderful, and the pictures are fabulous! All in all this is a wonderful children's book. My 5 year old and 4 year old beg for me to read this book over and over."
5,A Bad Case Of Stripes,"I am doing my internship for teaching and got this book to share with my kids, I loved it as a kid and they loved it also."
2,"Good message, but not a book for younger children","My 4-year old daughter had this book read to her at preschool and has been having nightmares about it. She was even afraid to tell me what her nightmares were about and would only say it was something they read at school. I think the message in the book is an important one, but the drawings are too creepy and disturbing for many of the younger kids."
1,a bad case of stripes,This book was read to my daughter in Kindergarten. She cried for many days and was afraid of everything. It took a couple of weeks for her to go back to normal. She is now 6 years old and in 1st grade. The book was read to hear again about three weeks ago and we are going throught the same fear that she had before. She has never acted this way and she is never afraid of anything except this book. The story of the book is not bad but the graphics are NOT appropriate for little children.
1,Book terrifies a young child,"I can only share with you that my 5 year old grandson just passed by the book at a bookstore, not sure if he looked inside, and had an awful reaction including nightmares. Just recently he saw the book advertised in a reader's guide and he started trembling. He does not want to go to a bookstore for being afraid of finding the book. Needless to say it, I am worry about this and don't know how to help him.Reading these reviews made me feel that his reaction is not an isolated one. The author needs to be mindful that pictures can be desvastating to a young sensitive mind."
1,A horrible book!,"As the mother of four girls, I find this book very disturbing. It is so important to teach girls (and boys) to be confident in who they are and not worried about what other people will think of them. This book gives girls the idea that other peoples' opinions are extremely important and should be considered at long lengths before doing, saying, eating or wearing ANYTHING. The drawings in this book are scary and the scenes where children are laughing at the little girl are heart-breaking. The hidden lesson in the book is way over a child's head."
2,Hidden gay agenda,Just read this to my 7 year old son that found the pictures interesting. This book is about a girl that is sick because she is trying to deny that she likes something wierd (Lima Beans). While the general message itself is fine this book has clear homosexual undertones. She gets a case of the stripes (Gay Symbol/Flag) that make her conform to whatever people tell her to be but she just gets worse until she embraces her weird (but harmless) predilections. The first and the last page have clear homosexual imagery; first page she is in the closet and the last page happy and wearing a gay stripped bow in her hair out in the park. This book is also promoted by homosexual advocay groups (see link below). I just wanted to let people know as this book is widely read in schools and I did not see any reviews addressing the gay undertones.(...)
1,For older children,I would be careful in reading this book to younger child. My four year old came home in tears and also had nightmares after it was read to her in preschool. The illustrations are VERY vivid and scary. Although the moral of the story is good I have to agree with another reviewer who stated that that this book is way over the head of most children.
2,Nice Message but too Scary!,"We checked this book out of the library. My daughter who is almost 6 began flipping through the pages and then came running, screaming, crying with tears saying the book is very scary and she did not want to even look at it, nevermind read it. I read it myself. The message is a good one - be yourself and don't worry about what others think, but the things that happen to Camilla are a bit graphic and scary for an impressionable child."
4,My 5-year old loves it,"We picked this book up at the library today because it was on the suggested summer reading list for my daughter (who enters kindergarden this fall).She loves it! We've read it together twice and she's gone through it herself several times. Although some kids might find the illustrations and concept scary, she thinks it's pretty cool.The books message, about the importance of being true to your feelings, is a bit sophisticated and I don't know if she really gets it. But I know at least one 5-year-old who doesn't think it's too scary."
5,A Bad Case of Stripes,"I thoroughly enjoy this page-turning children's book as much now as I did when I first read the story at the age of four. The key character, Camilla Cream, adores lima beans, which is extremely unusual for children at her school. Because she wants to fit in, Camilla gave up this one thing that she loves dearly just to be normal. When Camilla begins turning into a rainbow of colors, doctors, specialists, and experts have no idea why Camilla's body goes wild. Miserable from taunting and reporters outside her home, Camilla starts changing shades and grows sprouts here and there and everywhere! I rate this story a five out of five stars for children of the ages 4-8. When anyone reads this story, their eyes will be entertained along with their own imagination from the vibrant words that match their visual counterparts. How will Camilla reverse back to normal?"
3,What are you looking at?,"I am reading the reviews for this book wondering whether or not to get it for my child. I don't understand how this story could be much different than Pinkalicious turning pink...but I haven't seen the images. I wish someone would actually post pictures of these ""scary"" images so other parents can judge for themselves."
1,A Bad Book for Scaring a Child,"Watch out if you have a child who is easily scared. My Kindergartener had the book read to her in class and she is still frightened at night about the girl with weird stripes. So just a caution, some like it and some do NOT. For some it is just too odd and the illustrations are just too spooky"
1,This book really freaked my 5 year old out,Yesterday this book was read at my daughter's YMCA program and she has not smiled in the last 24 hours. She will not even discuss the book and is very disturbed by it. Luckily she did not have nightmares. I am telling the YMCA staff to not read this to younger children. Not reccomended.
1,Do not purchase.....,"My son is 5 years old and he can not even look at the cover of this book. Since reading this book to him about 3 weeks ago, he ask me everyday will he get strips if he does something bad. He missed message of the book and in his mind if you do something bad you get strips. I have never seen my son like this it is really strange. I had to hide the book because if he looks at it he starts to cry. My son is not afraid of anything, but this book did something to him. It is nice to know that other kids are having the same experience. I would not recommend this book."
1,so scary book ever to her,"i didn't know this book until i found out my 4 yrs old looks wierd after reading this book from her preshool. she loves to read books and never gotten any problems by any of books she has ever read, but this one. she is fear and change a different person totally afterward. i can't find out what she was so worry about until a week after she asked. ""what is my color?"" then, she refused to talk and still keep guiet for a hour or more, look she is worry."
3,Illustrations vs. Storyline,"I found this book at the high school library. The storyline is cute, but lacking in substance. The illustrations hold this book together, although they may be disturbing if you have an overactive imagination. As an adult,the illustrations are amazing and creative."
3,On the Creepy side,My seven year-old daughter and I found the book a little creepy. It gave her nightmares.
2,The pictures terrify my 5-year old.,"My daughter read this book in her preschool class almost a year ago and every once in a while, she either wakes up screaming or has a meltdown before bed because the pictures gave her nightmares. And she's not a skittish kid. I'm sure the book has a good message, but I'd say the review listed from Reed Business Information is accurate. Watch out for the illustrations."
3,Thank you!,Purchased as a Christmas gift. (satisfied but wish it didn't have a library's stamped info on the inside cover)Thank you!
3,Creative but creepy,"The illustrations and idea of the book are excellent, but I didn't like the 'out of controlness' of the girl sprouting roots, feathers etc, essentially turning into a monster or being spread across her bedroom walls. I'm not surprised that one reader said her child was now eating his veggies after reading the book, he's probably afraid he'll turn into something fierce and better eat up! I think the macabre aspect is just too inappropriate for the younger children and did not find it an enjoyable read at all."
1,So scary my 8 year old cried himself to sleep,"My 8 year old son looked through this book at the school library because he thought it would be funny. He decided it was too scary, so didn't check it out. BUT, just that quick glance through was disturbing enough that I had to hold him while he CRIED himself to sleep that night. He was too scared to even tell me what it was about (other than a scary book) and it took an hour for him to even utter the name of the book. He is usually a pretty thick-skinned kid, not a crybaby, but I think his brain couldn't process the pictures.I noticed even the Editor's review mentions disturbing images in the first sentence. Take heed, it's true."
5,One of my favorites,"I use this book all the time in the afterschool classes I teach. It is one of my absolute favorites- it teaches kids to be individuals and think for themselves. It also has gorgeous illustrations with so much detail that the kids pore over them and have fun calling out what they see in the pictures, what they think will happen next, etc."
4,Dayzia's review,"A Bad Case Of Stripes is a little funny and a good story for all ages. I liked this book and you will too! You should buy it. In the beginning, Camilla got the stripes because she pretended she didn't like lima beans but she really did. School was a disaster. All the children laughed at her and called her names. In the middle, she couldn't stand it. She said wait to the old woman and had the lima beans suddenly she turned back into herself again. At the end, Camilla never had even a touch of stripes again.The theme is be honest with yourself. I know this because Camilla said she didn't like lima beans but she was honest in the end. And Ira Sleeps Over is a great book for children too. The theme in this story is be honest also.You should buy it for any one you like."
1,Terrifying for preschoolers,"My daughter's preschool teacher read this book to the class and it terrifies her. She has nightmares and can't stop talking about how scary it is to her. She asks constantly whether she's going to turn ""stripedy"" and what makes her change. Definitely something for the older kids only."
1,From Ohio - Mother of Three,This book has completely traumatized my 6 year old daughter. She has read it at school and has come home having nightmares about it at night. Every time she talks about it or thinks about it it upsets her. I believe this book should be saved for older children.
5,How Wonderful It Is To Be Different!,"I bought this book for my 7 year old son's birthday, but had to read it myself right away! The artwork IS that compelling! What an amazing man, what an amazing book, and what an amazing thing learning to be you!!!"
5,A funny book to teach children to be themselves!,This book is laugh-out-loud funny. A Bad Case of Stripes teaches children to be themselves without worrying what others think about them.Great book for 6 years and up.
5,Excellent read - well plotted and written,"This series hits it's stride in this novel - there are even fabulous side characters with interesting stories to tell. I did not want to put this book down until finished. This was well paced and very believeable.Also look for the Bold Strokes Books edition published October 2004.This is a Keeper !Don't miss any of the novels in the series -Above All, HonorHonor BoundLove & HonorHonor GuardsHonor Reclaimed"
3,Sloppy writing,"The book is mildly entertaining. The two main characters are interesting and likeable, although the plot lacks the dramatic energy to really keep the reader engaged. The element of suspense is simply not strong enough for the genre. One of my primary frustrations is that the author does not understand the concept of point of view (and apparently neither does her editor). Switching from one character's mind into the other without cause or pause weakens the dramatic tension and brings an ameteurish air to the writing. Considering how many books she has written, I'm surprised a good editor hasn't helped her learn this important skill."
5,Love & Honor,I loved the book. I have read all of the Justice seriers and Honor series. Each book describes romances differently and you don't get bored. Excellent reading. Best author I have ever read.
5,herve leger,Smells wonderful... The lotion could be thicker so be careful when pouring. The fragrance is still one of my absolute favorites.
1,Gambled and lost,"I should have known based on other reviews not to get these so-called Slim Jims.The expiration date was old and the product tasted quite unpleasant. I don't understand why they think they can sell expired food, but I know I won't be getting any more."
2,Amazon sent me expired food items!,"I always liked Slim Jim's but I can't say the same for the Pepperoni & Cheese! The pepperoni is fine, nice and spicy! But the cheese is horrible...if you can call it cheese? It has a funky color and the texture is very dry! My first order came and it had an expiration date of 12/22/06...I received the order on 12/28/06, so they sent me expired food? I complained and Amazon was quick to send out a replacement...very nice right? The replacement had the same expiration date of 12/22/06?? Why Amazon, why??? Don't buy this item as I will be throwing away 2 boxes of them.ps- Amazon said they will refund me the purchase price :-) Thanks Amazon."
3,Okay,"Not really used to purchasing food online, but gave it a try. They just didn't seem fresh enough to me. I would much rather continue buying them at my local store."
3,Can't recommend it,"As I stated in the title, I cannot recommend this product. There may well be folks who enjoy it, and I hope they chime in, but I really didn't care for it. The pepperoni has a nice spicy flavor and is typical Slim Jim fare. In the first package I opened the pepperoni was a little on the oily side, but the two subsequent ones were fine. The cheese is where this product fails.I was expecting a cheddar as the product description on Amazon states. The actual product packaging says it's a cheddar-parmesan mix. It tastes little like cheddar but is rather reminiscent of parmesan. It also has a texture that is reminiscent of parmesan in that it is hard and dry. That's the reason you grate parmesan rather than serve it sliced or, in this case, in a stick.While the pepperoni is fine, I didn't really care for the flavor or the texture of the cheese. 3 out of 5 stars is the best I can give it."
1,Chincy,"While I knew these were for little boys dressing up as football players rather than protection playing football, I NEVER expected them to be SO flimsy. They barely look like shoulder pads under a jersey, and they have totally inadequate means of staying in place. they look NOTHING like the picture."
4,Works well,"Needed it for a lab at my school.It does its job, not too expensive.Thankfully it's limits haven't been tested yet but I'm sure that it can more than hold its own.Feels sturdy and economical."
2,Of limited value,This book is basically of value only to elementary teachers who wish to get published in magazines or other periodicals. It needs to broaden its scope to all teachers and include publishing lesson plans and other classroom ideas. I was disappointed. There is not much here. I thought I was buying an entirely different book.
4,"""Where's Waldo?"" for naturalists","This book is not just a collection of amazing photography, but a showcase of camoflage in nature. It gives you a deep appreciation of animals in their element, and of the amazing adaptations they have acheived to become better hunters, and better survivors. Worth the price as a photography book, worth double that for conversational and educational value. Would make a wonderful gift for the photographer, outdoorsman or animal lover in your life."
4,Fun Book,"Fun book ... although the animals in the pictures aren't as hidden in the images as the description would lead you to believe. (I'm a big fan of Bev Doolittle paintings where you have to study the picture for a little bit to see the hidden images.)But, bought it to look at with my young granddaughter ... so, maybe that's a good thing it isn't too difficult.The pictures of themselves are great and its interesting how animals have adapted themselves to their environments."
5,Vanishing Act is an amazing experience ...,"Yes, the photography is outstanding ... but it's the subjects that will amaze you.This book kept a group of 5 kids ranging from 6 to 16 engaged for almost an hour turning the pages and talking about every image. The parents were so surprised that, when the kids finished, they picked up the book and ended up spending another half hour browsing through every page.Creating and assembling a collection of photographs that can do that is a very impressive feat. This is a book worth owning....."
1,Whar a deplorable movie!!,"Deplorable firstly because of its obvious exploration of JMV, who appears for less than 2 minutes in the whole movie, but still manages to get top billing at the beginning! And what were the makers thinking allowing him to appear so drunk! Obvious exploration of his name. Secondly what a crap movie, deplorable for its use (not very well) of violence, sex and drugs to carry the story (what story)! It gets 1 star from me because of some reaonable acting, though some actors are miscast being much younger than they should be. Save your money and buy something else!"
3,Good bedtime reading..,"Ms. Osler wrote this book after her best seller 'A Breath From Elsewhere' so maybe my disappointment is owing to reading number two. I honestly can't see why everyone is so excited about this author. It's a nice book and pleasant to read before you go to sleep, but not particularly insightful (Jim Nollman, Allen Lacey), funny (Henry Mitchell), filled with useful information (Miss Elizabeth Lawrence) or historical tidbits (Anna Pavord). It's a good read, but doesn't deserve 5 stars."
2,Disappointing lamp,"The description of the lamp sounded as if it would be perfect for my needs - extra lighting in a room that tends to be dark. Unfortunately the quality did not meet my expectation. After putting the lamp together, it was never straight. The lamp wobbled on the base and the pole leaned. My husband and I both tried to make adjustments because I didn't want to return it, but it was never acceptable and I finally did return it."
4,A great resource,"For the keen on Yoga, this is a great resource. It is commendable that the Author has made an effot to compile the huge volumes of ancient Indian scriptures - many of which is a life-time study - into a single volume. With such an effort, there would many purposes served and some not served too well. You have the vedantas, yoga sutras, history of yoga, history and philosophy of various religions all in one place. Because of this, the reader could get a bit lost for there would be too much to understand.Nonetheless, I treaure this book; as a Yoga teacher, I find that I constantly go back to this volume. Secondly, the effort is commendable because these ancient texts are still not public as much as we want them to be."
5,"A fantastic book on Yoga; rich, clear and well organized",I bought a copy of this book (softcover) and then gave it to my yoga teacher and bought the hardcover. We both love the book. It clearly explains many topics better than most other sources and has a clear organization for such a substantial reference. My first literary source now for Yoga guidance and clarity. thx & namaste
2,"Dry, academic, boring","If you are looking for an encyclopedia of yoga this book is a reasonable consideration. It is, however, very dry, fact-filled, clinical, and boring. I have practiced yoga daily for over 36 years. I also teach yoga. I appreciate the scholarship contained in this book. But it is too academic for most readers. Most readers will want something more engaging from the text. Perhaps this book will serve the needs of those who want a reference book for their bookshelf. Namaste."
4,"Beautiful Cinematography, Adequate Interpretation","This depiction of Franz Kafka's masterpiece, The Trial, begins beautifully but seems to end on a sour note. The way in which the film is shot, however, is irreproachable. The rapid camera movement as well as the technological limitations of Black and White film produce a truly eerie effect. The climax of the text, however is unfulfilled within the film. While the ending is somewhat disappointing, the film is undoubtably successful in its interpretation of the majority of the work."
5,What made Perot a real player in presidential politics?,"Third parties have always interested me and I found that this book explained why and how they exist. It gave me a real understanding of what political circumstances will give rise to new party (what do we need to look out for!) I truly admired Ross Perot and this book explains his rise and fall objectively. They don't sugar-coat his candidacy, but they give it the respect it deserves."
1,One is too many,"The authors announce that third parties may make a difference in a presidential election. One wonders if Abe Lincoln could have benefited from this remarkable insight.Thousands of words arranged in leaden and nearly indecipherable poli-sci English (?) brings forth not even a mouse. If only George Orwell were still living--what fun he would have reviewing this ""acadaspeak"".O well, profs must publish, or they might perish-or take a meaningful job of work.In the latter case, at least the trees would gain."
1,Meaning in the Stars?,"The essence of astrology is that there is ""meaning"" in the stars, e.g. that when Jupiter is in Leo, it means something. Other forms of divination presume to find meaning in other things in nature, e.g. that the arrangement of tea leaves or chicken entrails or the lines in one's palm have some esoteric meaning. These ""Gospel in the Stars"" books presume to find Biblical meaning in the constellations.In our efforts to ""prove all things, hold fast to that which is true,"" we should be very wary of the notion that a 19th century scholar, using Medieval sources, discovered an antedeluvian prophecy of Jesus in the constellations known to Aratus in 275 B.C. A reader seeking a Scriptural and scientific work on Biblical astronomy should instead read the 1908 work, ""The Astronomy of the Bible"" by noted solar astronmer E.W. Maunder."
4,"Great dry lube, but needs a straw applicator","I primarily use this dry lube on RC helicopters, but it has many other uses. I have used it on hinges with great short term success, but it doesn't last as long as oil-based lubes for hinges. I think the best solution would be the addition of a small straw applicator, which would allow you to focus the spray right into the hinge. As far as RC helis go... My same gripe, a straw applicator would help apply the lube to specific points, and not coat surrounding parts."
5,Toilers of the sea,"My husband has done a lot of paint by number drawings. This was the best. Had it framed and it is more beautiful. Great paint, it was a work of art."
4,Accumulator,"Seems to be fine. Too early really to tell, but it is of reasonably heavy plastic construction with a metal Schraeder valve into the bladder."
4,SHURflo 182-200 Pre-Pressurized Accumulator Tank.,"Hi, my trailer's water pump was very noisy; I made my own silencer hoses because the pre-made ones are straight on both ends. I needed two [one on each hose] 90 degree ends. This helped, but wasn't enough. After installing this Accumulator tank, next to my water pump, the noise is barely audible. This is what I wanted. Also the connector tube that came with this tank, made my install so much better/easier."
5,Great upgrade for an RV.,This little surge tank makes a great upgrade for anyone who bookdocks and uses their water pump a lot. Really quietens down the pump noise.
3,Works but not impressive,"Like many RV owners I had the problem of a noisy pump in my travel trailer. Many claim this solves or greatly reduces the problem. It seems nicely made, I'll give it that. The noise attenuation was negligible to my ears. It did buffer the cycle time by maybe another second. Was it worth it? No. I left it installed in that camping trailer when I traded it off last month."
4,Shurflo RV Accumulator Tank,"I installed this unit in my travel trailer. Didn't like all the cycling and hammering. First of all, I went for the free shipping and it was here before I knew it. Probably 5 days. The install was pretty straight forward.I took the time to insulate/isolate any pipes that were laying against anything else. Really helped to minimize resonating the noise through the trailer when the pump is running. Now the pump comes on only after the faucet runs for 3 to 5 seconds depending on how far open you turn the faucet. It doesn't do that on/off, on/off, on/off thing when you have the faucet on just a little bit.Very pleased with it. Worth while project."
5,Great Accumulator,This serge tank/accumulator solved the problem with my RV so the pump doesn't short cycle. It works great!
5,My Wife Loves It,"I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She says she feels better every time she drinks it. She's very careful about her nutrition so she won't eat or drink just anything. I'm not quite up to the healthy green drinks yet, but I'm working on it."
5,worth its weight in gold,"I find Wendon Blake's book to be a necessity for any serious beginner. It is well-organized and easy to read.W.B. clearly describes how to analyze the hues of the nature, choose and mix the correct pigmentation, how to lighten, darken and intensify paints, how to get maximum effect with limited palette (many great painters of the past used only four or five colors), how to observe local and atmospheric colors, etc...In addition, ""Creative Color"" includes numerous reproductions (paintings of Homer, Cassatt, Sargent, Whistler, Twatchman, and other artists). In that part of book Blake explains how these famous painters put into practice the principles described in the text.To keep it short - this very reasonable priced book is full of practical advice and valuable tips. One of the best ""how-to"" books on painting I have read."
4,Great bag,"This is a great bag for snowboards: sturdy, nice lining to keep you dry and enough padding for your board to be safe."
4,Time to heal?,"This book discusses one man's struggle to understand what happened to him in Viet Nam and what happened to him when he returned home, increasingly unable to avoid terrible, debilitating headaches.A man who loves his wife and family finds himself in terrible trauma, unable to work and turns to the Veterans Administration to get help. He finds some kindness, and much neglect.As he details his struggle, I cried, laughed and shook my head in dismay.The ending is both jubilant and sad.The book is well written and telling. I can imagine the author sitting in my living room telling me the story in his own words and voice."
2,Doesn't Stand!,"My 5 year old really wanted Rodan for Christmas, but he hardly ever plays with it because the figure doesn't stand on it's own.It sucks because it is the only toy in the series with this problem. Rodan just keeps falling over, so it's kind of a clown show!"
5,"Best for Dry, Curly, Frizzy, Unruly Hair!","My hair is all of the above. It's also thick, coarse, and long. I used to hate my hair; it took me 20 years to get used to it. But when I was growing up there were no gels or styling lotions. I had to leave in conditioner or, when I was in high school and found out this trick: leave in baby oil. But that got messy.I still need to use a lot of product--at least one gel and then Aveda's sculpturing Lotion. Don't use too much, though, or some areas may dry a little whitish. Since I cannot wash my hair every day, if I notice this happening in the morning, I simply wet a washcloth and spot stroke the area. It works great. I love this Aveda product and would be very upset if they stopped producing it. Do NOT use the similar version in spray form; it comes out sticky and gross and makes your hair unmanageable."
5,The soul of a new chess player,"Feng-Hsiung Hsu's story will appeal to anyone who enjoyed Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine or Steven Levy's Hackers. The book captures the thrills and spills of an intellectual steeplechase. Along the way, it reveals the inner workings of the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University. It's a great read. Feng-Hsiung Hsu, if you're reading this and you ever find yourself in Hortonville, Wisconsin, the first cup of coffee is on me."
2,Computers and savant conceit,"Conceit and self-righteousness have become the calling cards of anyone who can outdo someone or something with computers. Big deal. All the self adulation that has gone into this tacky piece of work can't hold a candle to the fact that Gary Kasparov can play chess (and think!) Which is more than I can say about the vanity displayed by the author. Anyone who sets out to humiliate or bring down a champion by using questionable means has zero integrity. However, it's to be expected from this kind of individual.It is singularly unimpressive; vain and self indulgent."
4,"Good, but could have been better","Hsu makes it clear that he doesn't like software. His focus in ""CS"" (Computer Science) is actually Electrical Engineering. Thus, almost nothing is mentioned about the Chess software itself. What does the evaluation function do? How does Deep Blue/Deep Thought, etc. work? We aren't told much. So if you want details about Deep Blue, look elsewhere. If you want to learn about chip design, then this book will interest you. Mostly, it is a narrative about Hsu and his team and their adventures. It is about Hsu's career and the competition. But not really so much about what went into Deep Blue. Try J. Schaffer's book, One Jump Ahead. Although it is about checkers, not chess, it is much more interesting from a software development point of view."
4,Very good value for beginning flute,"I am impressed with the value on this product. The catalog that was shipped with the flute was even more impressive. I did find the sound to be very ""airy"". The pitch of the notes were not that crisp. However, I was able to make some modifications to the roost and bird so now it sounds good. I do plan on purchasing more items for myself and as gifts."
1,I would give it zero stars,I had this flute. It sounded horrible and sometimes no sound would come out of it at all. I ended up throwing it away and purchasing a wooden flute on ebay for about 50 dollars. The one I bought on ebay is much better. I have no problems with it whatsoever. The wooden ones cost a little more. I've seen them online for about 100 dollars. The wooden ones are well worth the money. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
4,Rugged truck,We found this RC truck to be very durable. It has far outlived any other RC truck that we have owned in this price range. The airplane's launch mechanism is not as durable. We are hoping to get our airplane fixed so that we can fly it again because it was alot of fun when it worked. We do warn that you need PLENTY of space to fly the plane. It is NOT an indoor activity. We had to retrive the plane from our roof several times. It really flys! We like this product so much that we are considering buying other products from this manufacturer's RC line.
2,Cheap copy and softcover,"In my experiance, this book is informative and good in the area of computational Holograhpy image processing.However, the copy of this book that I received from amazon is badly stupid because of its cheap copy and softcover,even if it is very expansive ($178.49)"
4,love it,"My daughter loves this doggie pet dinner, the only thing is it has a lot of little peices to keep track of."
5,Wow! So that's what the war was like!,"Prim and proper Victorine LaGrande, a Creole girl of 17 years, is all set in an arranged marriage with the breathtakinly handsome Andre Valmont. But things have a way of changing during wartime. Victorine spots Andre walking arm in arm with another woman. Then, one Mardi Gras and a sprained ankle later, Victorine is the one who feels like breaking off the engagement- she has met one Dr. Brent Whitman, an American. Unfortunatly for both of them, he is also someone who is a completly innapropriate match for Victorine- in her father's eyes."
2,Way too strong for Aqua,"Hugo Boss cologne has a reputation with me for being strong, way too strong, almost choking. I like my colognes to be gentle, clean and long lasting. i usually go for Aqua like perfumes e.g D&G Light blue. I saw Aqua on this Hugo Boss and decided to give it a try, I am looking for something long lasting. Well this was a typical Hugo, choking and strong. It announces it presence way before you enter the room, its loud. There is no ""Aqua"" feeling in this one, certainly not light and watery. I discarded it quickly, but it may work for some others folks."
3,Not as good compared to the original Elements scent,Well I cant afford to complain. I am a huge fan of the original Hugo Boss Elements scent and didnt know what Aqua would be like. So i took the plunge and it is a pretty decent scent. I think it just got too sweet for me after a while but other than that no complaints. It is a good scent.
2,Clueless Reviewing the Blues,"The constant berating of people who's voices aren't 50's style radio ""pukers"" as ""being totally devoid of emotion"" or ""unable to express emotional content"" belays an inherent lack of understanding of the blues and how the music expresses emotion. This book smacks of a pampered academic trying to compare workin' folks' music to slick city jazz enjoyed by the priveleged upper class. I bought this book used for $8.00 and refuse to sell it or give it away. I have hidden it at the back of my closet in the hopes that it will NEVER see the light of day. I give it 2 stars for the accuracy of the listing of the players on the discs and the slightly more accurate reviews of the instrumental playing."
3,FUN BUT STIFF.,"Jack Benny is a little stiff in his performance, but he and Sheridan play amazingly well together in this sometimes hilarious little comedy about a couple who move into an old, broken-down country home in Connecticut; it's one catastrophe after another as the couple tries to renovate the place and deal with their greedy neighbour. Based on the play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart."
1,Not as durable as I'd hoped,"When I first got this chopper, I was really pleased -- it is efficient, easy to clean and actually fun to use. But the plastic disc that keeps food from going up into the blades got ""chopped"" by the blades the 3rd or 4th time I used it, rendering it useless. Now it's in the trash. Disappointing on the durability side of things, to say the least!"
2,Wayyyy overpriced!,"The first time I tried this chopper was in the middle of throwing a dinner party -- I was making salsa fresca and needed to chop lots of tomatoes, onions, and cilantro -- what a MESS! The chopper handles ""crisp"" things like apples and onions and raw potatoes okay (unfortunately, only in very small quantities, so it's usually more time-efficient to just do them by hand), but with anything slightly softer like tomatoes -- forget it. It's also sort of a pain to clean. I'd price this item at $5.99 and THEN consider recommending it!"
4,Small Dynamo,"I was given a gift certificate and chose this being a somewhat experienced cook/chef and having much more detailed food processors. For what it is and for the cost, it does a super job on veggies, herbs and nuts. I think most of the negative commentary is from those that can't cut an onion with a knife to begin with, or have no concept of physics. You push a handle down, it rotates, and cuts up things..not all that difficult. Easy to clean as well."
4,An improved version!,"This Zyliss Chopper is easier to clean than its non-dishwasher safe alternative. The big plus here is that it opens for cleaning AND is dishwasher safe. (Now, cleaning that very sharp blade is actually a possibility.) I think it's often a better choice than a food processor because you have more control over how finely you chop the food.Sometimes, though, for real precision, I'd still use a basic old knife. But for saving time for regular chopping, this product helps out!"
3,not practical,"the zyliss food chopper is not what its cracked up to be!the cutting blades are spaced too far apart, this allows chunks of onions, peppers etc. to lodge between them.when we buy something like this we expect to save time,dislodging stuck items defeats the purpose.if you're willing to cut the items to be chopped into smaller pieces this item will work for you."
5,27 Ford Roadster,"MSD Ignition 8202 Blaster 2 Hi-Performance CoilI recently installed a 6/71 supercharger on my 1927 Ford T-Bucket Roadster and was having misfire and some hesitation on acceleration problems. I order and installed the MSD Ignition 8202 Blaster 2 Hi- performance Coil. The car no longer misfires and I have more torque and take offs, this is great......Thanks MSD.SSG StapletonU.S. ARMY"
5,great item!!,"joelt item, felt difference immediately even lower idle a bit after install 8) first upgrade I'd do to my next project would be this."
1,Useful Information,"The coil itself works fine BUT, it does not come with ""Supplied with 0.8 ohm ballast resistor, terminal and boot"" like Amazon says it does. Which sucks, because now I have to order those parts seperately and wait longer to get my car running. If you need the ballast resistor, terminal and boot, order theMSD Ignition 8203 Blaster 2 Hi-Performance Coil, which includes them. Amazon, you really should change your description to match what the product comes with."
5,Excellent!,"The three smaller countersinks have a 1/4"" shaft, and the two large ones have a 1/2"" shaft. I've used them on soft & hard wood, on brass, and on mild steel, with good results. My only concern is, the two larger cutters will eventually wear out and Grizzly doesn't sell them individually. The three smaller bits are sold by Grizzly (or Amazon) as set H3024, for about thirteen dollars. They are made in India, if that means anything... The bits appear to be tool-steel, and are excellent quality."
2,All the handwriting is fake!,"I'm a fan of the Real World, but I feel somehow cheated with this book. I realized halfway through it that none of the handwriting was real. MTV had used clever and no doubt expensive fonts that just look like it. I don't know if if was just recreated based on voice interviews or if their real handwriting wasn't ""edgy"" enough for MTV, but it sucks. I feel like this is supposed to be a look into what they were thinking and feeling, but it just made the whole thing seem so contrived. All the scraps of paper and seemingly poorly written entries were completely fabricated to skew the readers image of these people even more than the show did. All in all, I thought some of their experiences were interesting and insightful, but the deliberate attempt of MTV to further manipulate the appearances of these people just made me sick."
1,MTV Get Off The Air,Mtv is such a lame TV station. Doesn't it mean MUSIC Television? I've never seen any music on there. All there is are these stupid reality shows. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK AND DON'T WATCH MTV!!!
5,Well-balanced,With singing and instrumental and dialogue. It amply relives the musical for the new audience member. I enjoy listening to it.
4,Elton John's musical,Very British in its style with lots of thumping music.There are some beautiful songs -Electricity- that make the record collection worth having.
1,"Coarse foul language, naturalistic, unromantic, capitalism bashing","I would not call this a 'musical'. 90% of the text/lyrics is coarse, full of foul language (even the kids!), unintelligible lower class English and the characters (if one can call them that) are uninspiring, even depressing. No heroes here. Lots of bashing of the symbol of capitalism too, being Margaret Thatcher. The main character, a boy who wants to become a ballet dancer, is no pleasant person either. He even knocks down one of his innocent ballet dance competitors, without any consequences to him. The motives that move the main characters are also wholly unclear, if known at all. The singing is more like screeching and totally 'unmemorable. This is a 'pseudo-musical reality show'."
5,Billy Elliott - The Musical,A great program that really captures the heart of Billy Elliott's story. Elton John's music rocks the entire program. Very enlivening and enjoyable.
5,Wonderful CD,I thoroughly enjoy listening to the Billy Elliot CD. I can't wait to go to New York and see it
4,Perfect new Musical,"When I'm first listened to Billy Elliot, i though I can hear Les Mis, Miss Saigon and a bit of Cabaret. Now I am the opinion that this is a brilliant new Musical, with a lot of hearted characters.I also like to hear ""Marry Christmas Maggy Thatcher"", a song, that's only possible in England with it's dark British Humour.I think this musical is grand night out."
1,Billy Elliot cd defective,I ordered the Billy Elliot cd as a gift for my in-laws and both disks were blank. Did anyone else have this problem?
4,Kudos to Elton,More melodic and dramatic than most cast recordings these days. Well worth owning.JWH
5,Just like the show!,"The show is wonderful and the cast recording brought the scenes back to life. A ""must see"" for any visitor to NYC and a great memento of really good performances."
3,Not sturdy enough,"This is a fabulous grater. I used it constantly, a few times a week, to grate hard cheeses like Romano and Parmigiano, washing it in the dishwasher. However, the plastic handle has broken after less than six months of use. I am going to buy the identical-looking Zyliss grater in non-transparent plastic, also listed on Amazon[.com], because I'm hoping the different type of plastic might be sturdier."
2,"Bought it, returned it","I bought this as a replacement for an old Mouli grater that was looking its age, but what a disappointment. Because the handle is fixed on one side, the grating plane is not an open cylinder, unlike the Mouli (and the Cuisinpro, which I'm now using) When grating a slightly soft cheese--a sharp cheddar--the drum quickly became clogged with cheese shred and it was almost impossible to clean them out."
5,Fantastic! Good service too..........,"This is a lovely pot rack. It's more like a piece of art rather then something you buy to store your pots on. It was very easy to put together and hang. Durable and sturdy. When I was putting it together my 3 year old took off with some of the screws. I never found them, so I called Old Dutch. They were nice, and they sent me replacement screws for free! I had them in two days!"
2,Not what was expected from a new product,"Item came already rusted and the two hanging hooks to hang it from the ceiling were different sizes, Other than those two problems the rack is sturdy enough to hold my pots and pans"
4,"Looks great, even years later","Looking at my old purchases - I purchased and installed this in 2004. It was pretty easy for me to install, even with my two left hands. It's been up for 8 years and hasn't fallen / crushed anyone yet. It looks great and I hang most of my pots and pans from it...and we're talking cast iron here. This thing holds it all. Only complaint I can think of is that it does not hang evenly...Mostly because I have a lot more weight on one side (large cast iron wok). Other than that, it's been perfect. I would definitely purchase again!"
5,Dutch copper pot rack,"We were very pleased with the quality of this item for the price. It included quite a few hooks and securely holds the weight of nine stainless steel pots with their respective lids. It also looks great in the kitchen (it's very shiny), but make sure the ceiling height is at least 8 feet high or you will be bumping into the hanging items even when the rack is positioned over a kitchen island as ours is. We would recommend this product."
5,Couldn't be happier............,"This beautiful, stylish, and extremely functional pot rack has been hanging in my kitchen for a little over a year. I wanted something to show off my All- Clad pans, and after exhaustive research I decided on this.This pot rack is impressive. You can't help but focus on it, and it's gorgeous. One look at this beauty and you can see the workmanship and quality. It's a real attention getter.I really can't say enough about this pot rack. If you're even thinking about it, then go for it. You'll be happy you did."
3,Spanish Magnetic Poetry,"The Spanish magnetic poetry is fun, but I feel like it's not amazing because sometimes the words I want aren't in the kit."
2,Not so Puzzling,"The way the writer sways back and forth timewise in telling the story is frequently confusing. The many characters introduced are more baffling. Some of them play small parts in the whole yarn yet they are emphasized with an abundance of details. The first three-quarter of the story reads like a soap opera spiced up with puppy love. Most of the dialogues are intriguing and a handful of them are quite hilarious. The mystery itself lacks intensity and suspense. Some oversimplified aspects of crimes involving computers elaborated in the tale might scare part of the technology challenged population. When put into context with identity theft, the uncomplicated procedures involved that are portrayed in the book would easily worry anybody. Nonetheless, the ending is predictably satisfying. It reminds me of an episode on any police investigation series on TV."
5,One of the best,"This text is an awesome summary of 'state of the art' teaching models that improve student achievement. The scenarios provide a glimpse into what each model would look like in the classroom. The authors have also provided an extensive rationale and research base for each model. Joyce is definately an author that informed educators should pay attention to.If you want one of the best sources as an educator looking to improve his/her own teaching practice (and student achievement), this is it!"
1,Models is boring,I selected this book because it was required reading. The subject is such a waste of time I dropped out of the class and threw this book away.
2,okay,"The book was shipped on time. However, I bought this book new and the back hardcover was scratched poorly and the binding on this book is awful. The pages are falling apart. I was better off buying a used book."
2,Doesn't model real-life...,"Although this book covers some interesting models of teaching, it doesn't have realistic scenarios and some of the differences between the models are insignificant. This book dealt more with the where and when different models were created and who created them, then with the implementation of the models or where or when they are useful. I had this book in a graduate class and frankly, many of my undergraduate classes were written in a more usable manner."
3,OK text but no website,"I cannot believe that a graduate level textbook has NO internet resources. Other than that, it is an adequate text"
1,Terrible textbook,"This is a terrible textbook. I am forced to use it for a graduate class. The book presents numerous theories on teaching strategies and student learning models in a confusing jumble of disorganized writing. I am sure there are many good ideas in the book, it is just frustrating to try to find them. If possible, discourage your instructor from using this book. It is a waste of countless hours of research."
1,Never Received Item,I purchased this item for a christmas gift and have never received this item. I cannot give a rating to a product I never received.Iris Muckle
2,The typical Asian product,The item is missing two important screws and the ceiling hooks are so poor quality that they won't screw into the ceiling. The threaded edges are totally dull.
5,I should get out more often.,I was entirely too happy with this item. I was extremely satisfied with the quality to price ratio. It was better than some that were priced much higher. Perfect for the smaller kitchen. Sturdy and well built.
2,Is it really worth the money?,"I also found that the rack that holds the pans sagged in the middle. We have been worried that it would break and all the pans would come crashing down, but it hasn't happened yet. It looks nice in our kitchen, but I would have preferred a sturdier rack."
3,Walk off 10 lbs with Pedometer,"I love Leslie Sansone's walk at home DVDs. The workout DVD is great, however the pedometer didn't work. So I took it in for a new battery but the person at the store was unable to even get the battery out to put in a new one."
1,I'm done with Leslie Sansone Products,"I have about every Leslie Sansone product out there and I even hung in there when the first couple of bad videos started coming out but it's just too much lately...she has shifted from quality to quantity and is just pushing anything out the door to make more money and it's not at all the feeling I had when I first started using her products. I used to feel like I was part of a team now I just feel like I'm being used, especially after I went to her site and saw they only offer clothing up to a size XL. Why is that she is willing to make a living off people who are above an XL but they aren't good enough to provide clothing for?This is not a new video, it's a repackaged one and that is a cheap move in my eyes."
2,One of Leslie's worst,"I have worked out with Leslie for years and will probably continue because her style is vigorous without killing my knees. But I really hate her sloppy cueing and how she tries to make it look OK. It's NOT OK. If there was one worst Leslie offering this would have to be it. In this DVD she tries to bluff her way out by saying things like, ""Yay!"", ""Yeah!"" and ""Do X when your feet are ready"" when she jumps into a move without giving her 'class' time to jump in with her. She rambles her philosophies right through many arm movements, again, not cueing them. Leslie should really be more professional. It's awful to come home after a long day to work out to a sloppy DVD."
1,TrailORGranny,I would suggest that you DO NOT purchase this product. Leslie Sansone has some great DVD's out there but when mine arrived the pedometer was broken. I lost my packing slip so I guess I'm just out of luck in returning the product. I'll go buy a decent pedometer at a sporting goods store and chalk it up to lesson learned.
1,Walk Off 10 Pounds one of 6 new releases in 2008,I was so excited to find a new video from my favorite instructor only to get it and realize it was simply repackaged without the pedometor. I wasnt thrilled with the first release now i have two - I wish they would stop doing or at least let us know it is repackaged. It is becoming more and more common and not just with Walk At Home - I have had this happen with other instructors too. So disappointing.
3,Good video,I have one other DVD for Leslie Sansone and really enjoyed it.This one was not as good. The music did not go with the exercises and there is too much repetition from the prior video.I like exercising to Leslie and hope she will come out with a new exercise video.
1,Not the original artists,"I was quite excited when I saw all these songs for such a low price. I seemed like a great deal, until I heard it. These great songs have been butchered by a bunch of nobodies. Stay far away from this!!"
2,10K gold,Bought this 10K gold and silver wedding band because my original ring doesn't fit anymore. It looks beautiful on my computer but now I wish I had gotten one in 14K gold. This one looks like brass.No luster at all.My fault I guess.Live and learn.
3,Good... For its era,"This appears to be the only biography out there for a fascinating -- even controversial -- and important 20th century American painter and graphic artist. But perhaps as a product of its era, written and published less than ten years after the artist's death in the 1970s, the book is lacking in some crucial dates and perspectives. It is difficult to imagine a biography as incomplete as this being published today. Given all the affairs and trysts this artist initiated, how is it we have so little in the way of perspective from his wives, children, colleagues or friends? In fact, Kent's first wife, who was the mother of a number of his children, remains little more than a name dropped into the narrative here and there. Nonetheless, and notwithstanding some notable shortcomings in this narrative, the book is an adequate enough introduction to the life and times (and politics and mores) of one of our more fascinating creative figures."
5,"Very practical, highly usable","This is a great introduction to the assessment process with chapters specifically for departments and general education. The appendices include sample forms and processes for all types of assessment. A great practical resource for anyone responsible for creating an institutional or departmental assessment program. I know at my institution, faculty and administrators have been looking for something like this that can give them a concrete process for doing assessment. If you have only one book on assessment, this should be it. Other books fill in more about the theory and why, but the theory and why are nothing without implementation."
1,Another DVD disaster,"Beware -- this is NOT the movie ""as it was meant to be seen.""Although finally available -- and in widescreen -- the discpresents a severely compromised version of Robert Altman'sgreat film. As detailed by Brad Stevens in VIDEO WATCHDOGmagazine, No. 116, it has been shorn of three minutes --cuts that render some scenes incomprehensible -- due to musicrights issues (real or imagined by skittish studio lawyers).More damage has been done throughout by altering thesoundtrack -- carelessly and stupidly -- wherever certainsongs were originally heard in the film. What a shame.Don't erase those old tapes!"
4,A good introduction to the land battles of the first years of the Second World War in Europe,"Books on the history of World War II for young people are by necessity somewhat lacking in depth or limited in scope. The origins of the war were extremely complex and are strongly debated to this day. Furthermore, there are still significant disputes over the role of the major figures and why they did what they did.This book is limited to the major battles of the first four years of the war in the European theater and is restricted to base overviews of the action. In that sense and within the logical restrictions to the young reader, this is a quality book. It exposes the reader to the main events, some of the reasons for the tactics used and the major outcomes and consequences of the battle.If your interest is exposing young people to the basics of the primary European battles in the early years of World War II in Europe, then this book will serve your interests."
2,Kind of dull.,"I didn't completely HATE this book, there was a little about it I liked. But a lot of things ruined it for me. It had quite a few plot holes, and I didn't like the writing style. I liked hte main plot but I guess the way it was written killed it for me. Oh well. I did kinda enjoy the other book in the series though, Pandora."
1,Not Book Report material!,"I bought this for my 4th grader for a book report. I wish had read the reviews first. I agree that there is little information, little plot, and on the whole very dull. There are almost no facts but lots of meandering, lifeless stories. It did not teach any real historical facts and seemed to be poorly structured. The end result was having to go to the library to scrape together enough information to even do a basic book report. My son lost interest about a third of the way through this book. A colorful cover but thats about it. Not recommended."
3,Atticus of Rome,"Atticus, a young boy of 12 years is captured by Roman soldiers after watching his village burnt to the ground with his mother and sister trapped inside. Both Atticus and his father were shackled, chained and later separated when sold at a slave auction. The young boy was bought by a wealthy Roman aristocrat named Lucius Opimius, who was also the Emperor's closest friend. As Lucius had no sons of his own, he took young Atticus under his wing to teach him the importance of his duty, to protect the Emperor from people plotting against him. Atticus learns the meaning of true allegiance and proves himself worthy of his master's final generosity. This tale is the first of a new series called The Life and Times by the acclaimed author Barry Denenberg. Here, Denenberg brings to life the politics and civilization of ancient Rome. Very violent accounts of the Roman battles and gladiator games should be cautioned for the younger middle school readers."
1,A good premise undercut by poor execution.,"It is unfortunate that this book, with such a great premise, executes its ""story"" rather poorly. Glaring historical inaccuracies (Atticus was born in ""82 B.C."" - really? How would he have known the year if it was 78 years before Jesus of Nazareth was born, and longer still before the calendar was fixed with Christ's birth as the point seperating ""BC"" from ""AD""? And, still, he's a teenager in 30 B.C.? Again, how?!?), little dialogue, multiple plot holes, and choppy narrative all work to scuttle this story. The rich details of life in those times don't do enough to compensate for the lack of engaging characters, actual conversations, witty banter, or anything of sparkling, ""living"" substance.This author has several highly-reviewed works to his credit. However, ""Atticus of Rome"" probably will not join that pantheon."
1,Dosn't Work with all R Series Cameras,I have a Hp R847 camera and with those sides on this dock It won't let the camera come down on the dock to plug in. So I cut off the sides carefully and I thought then the will dock and plug in and it didn't match. One good thing is I can slide the battery in the side and charge it that way.(this model had for charging a side charge and the dock). This way you could charge both. So watch out it is misleading R Series doesn't mean for all. Judie (Michigan)
4,Very Good basic phone,"If you're like me and just want a basic phone, without all the extras, this one's a good choice. I got it to replace my old LG model, and I've been happy with the change. This Samsung is slender and decidedly not bulky, but it has relatively large keys that make dialing, etc., a breeze. It's set up like your standard cell phone--no new formats to get used to. I don't use the internet on my phone, so I can't speak to that.The one con I will mention is that the back of the phone (the battery cover) seems very flimsy--I don't know what Samsung was thinking when it designed it. It seems like it's made of thin plastic. So if you're hard on your phone, this model might not be the way to go. Otherwise, I have no complaints. Its battery charges quickly, and the phone stays charged longer than my LG did. The charge portal is in a weird spot--took me a moment to find--and also has a flimsy cover. But overall, not bad, not bad at all."
4,Basic Phone,"I've had this phone for close to a year and I am currently using T-Mobile prepaid with it.I can't speak much for the durability of the phone because i've been gentle with it but other than the battery cover, it seems well constructed.The external screen is very clear and displays time & date, battery life, signal strength and if it is on vibrate or silent mode. The backlight activates when you hold down the side button for about a second. It displays caller information quite clearly.If you only use it to make calls and text messages then this phone is a very good option to consider. It's keypad good and menus for basic features are very easy to use."
3,A good start,This is about the most readily available book on the sling as a weapon. Many of the reports on the slings ballistics are sensationalised in order to get people to buy the book and try the sling. Some back room JamesBondism as well. Still the cost isn't much and nothing better is easily available.
3,"Good, but too short to be useful","This is a good Hebrew research tool. It's best feature is that it's only two volumes (compared to 11+ for the Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament!). The entries are short compared to other theological lexicons and wordbooks, however, and you don't get as much depth as you do in other theological lexicons.If you're looking for slightly more than a lexicon, this is a great tool. But if you really want to study Hebrew words, their range of meanings, different usage, extra-Biblical usage, etc. try the 3 vol. Theological Lexicon of the Old Testament (Jenni, Westermann) or - for the best of the best - the Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament (11 vol completed, more to come)."
3,pokemon,this book was a good one for the kids...especially cause i got it for my sister and she loved it...but she love pokemon not me...well this book was not very educational...but very entertaining for the kids..i recommend it if your kids like pokemon..but not if your looking for something educational
1,Bogus entry.,Received this CD this weekend. Not the two CD twenty song set you see here ! Its one CD with only 6 songs. Only one song I've ever heard of.Caution.
4,Getting better everyday...,"It seems to me that Mr. Child is having more fun writing solo than with his partner Douglas Preston. Compared to their recent offerings, this solo effort is top notch thriller writing. While Child's recent Utopia was buried in a surfeit of detail, Storm has just the right amount of technical background together with excellent pacing. I would have given this 5 stars but for the somewhat drawn out conclusion."
4,Much Better than his Previous Efforts,"I have to say, Deep Storm is a much better novel than Child's last books. Death Match was interesting but still left me unmoved. Utopia was just, well, bad. Thankfully, Deep Storm outshines the last two named efforts. I won't give away the plot except to say - it is definitely NOT about Atlantis and therein lies the fun of the story. I especially appreciate that last little twist at the very end... gave me the willies....Yeah, what if? What if?"
4,A fun read.,It was enjoyable because it was not very predictable. The environment was intriguing and the characters fulfilled the roles nicely enough.
3,"Well-written, but pedestrian plot","I'm a big Preston/Child fan and have also read all of their solo novels. I'd agree with the other reviews that this is Child's best solo work so far. The characters are mostly realistic and likeable. The dialogue is not cheesy or over the top with the possible exception of the crazed Commander Koriolis. But there was just not enough originality in the story. It reminded me of Crichton's ""Sphere"" and the overzealous (and cliched) marines were straight from ""The Abyss"". The book starts out well with some intriguing hints at finding Atlantis. The historical research at the churches adds to the mystery. But in the end, what they find at the bottom is pretty typical (and mundane) sci-fi stuff. The story is very linear with little or no plot twists. The suspense is there-barely. But it is an interesting read and better than most of the other books in this genre."
3,An average sci-fi thriller (2.5 out of 5 stars),"Looked mildly interesting and had decent reviews (and a discounted hard cover price), so I picked it up. Not bad, but not great. Holds your attention once it picks up steam in the last third of the book. A totally preposterous dramatic crux, but hey it's sci fi, what do you want?? Perhaps some of the earlier Child/Preston books are better reads...?"
5,Sci-Fi thriller at its best,"I loved this. Read through it in two days - the pace is lighting fast, and the storyline fun and intriguing. Leave enought time to read, you won't be able to put it down. There is a big giant McGuffin at the center of this book - but it is so fun you really don't mind -- like the best thrillers, the McGuffin drives the story, but getting to the conclusion is so much fun you forget its importance and go with the thrill. And that is story telling at it's best. LOVED IT."
5,First and favorite,"I actually got to know the books by Preston/Child with that one. Great thriller. I guess at some point, this book will become a movie. The book is between Abbyss and a CIS. A real treat. Go for it."
3,Solid Thriller,"""Deep Storm"" is a solid and serviceable techno/scifi-thriller. The characters are not deep, but the story is both engaging and exciting, and I was very motivated to read it all the way through.Lincoln Child's story is of a secret submerged deep water facility built to uncover a mysterious energy source. Dr. Crane is asked to join the effort in order to uncover a series of illnesses sweeping through the employees of the facility (scientists and military).I've read Preston and Child before - ""Ice Limit"" and ""Riptide"" I found to be particularly good. The characters, I felt, were much stronger in those stories. But it didn't matter in ""Deep Storm"". The book is a very quick read, heavy on action and science.As long as you can live without strong characters, I'd recommend this well-written and exciting book."
3,A page turner.,"I very much enjoyed the novel and found it difficult to put down. The story is well written and paced just right. On the other hand it is not a particularly new story, it has been told a time or two already. But, oh well, it was told again well."
4,Classic thriller action ride,"Lincoln Child books are always a good escape reading. This one is no different. Suspense, action and a high technology environment. If you enjoyed previous novels like ""Utopia"", you'll have a great time with this one.This time action happens in an underwater facility, with a certain ""Abyss"" touch.Great summer/weekend read. Not as good as the Pendergast novels he writes together with Douglas Preston, but good anyway."
5,Deep Storm,A great read. Keeps you turning pages late into the night. Science and fiction in a wonderful blend.
4,Deep Storm,Lincoln Child's books are always worth reading. Deep Storm does not disappoint. Loved the twist at the end. Can't wait for his next book.
3,Review For Audio CD Version,Once this book gets going it's a lot of fun. It takes a bit longer than the Preston/Child Pendergast novels I'm used to reading. The story is a blast to follow along with.Now I think I'll read the actual novel because the audio CD is not very good. I really did not like the voice of the narrator. His breathless intonation for most of the characters was beyond annoying and gave each character other than the main protagonist an arrogant air that is not part of the story. I think they could have done much better.I really like using audio cd's for my commute and I think I'll avoid Scott Brick narration in the future.
2,YAWN!!!!,"I have not read Lincoln Child's books and apparently this was not a good one to start with. I was bored to the point where I read 150 pages and then brought the book back to the library. I was disappointed with the slooooow plot development, the annoying hangers at the end of the chapters that are not revealed in following chapter or even the chapter following it. Thrillers are my genre, but this book was not my cup of tea......"
3,Laws of physics... More like suggestions,"Deep Storm is a formulaic page turner with 2D characters. The one thing the book does well is to keep you curious until the far-fetched ending. Without giving too much away, I think the milky way would be revolving around earth just like the church used to believe if that was really down there.Science is a prop, explaining technological marvels here, then being pushed under the rug when the plot calls for a narrow escape or a huge undersea complex, built in 20 months at 10000 feet under that uses normal air for breathing. Or going to the surface in a hurry requires no decompression stops. It wouldn't be that hard to clean up some of the science. I don't know why Child doesn't bother.There is also substantial laziness of plot outlining. For instance many of the villains wouldn't have known what was down there, so why were they so determined to cause trouble... Well, because the audience would never suspect them I guess. Boo!"
4,Very imaginative plot,"I felt that the plot was pretty creative and not too far out on the edge. This is my first novel by Lincoln Child, but, based on this novel, I plan to read some of his others."
1,Impossible scenario with no reasonable explanations,The book was based upon an idea that was not plausible and could never be. It was fantasy that could not have a relationship to the ordinary or even extraordinary world.
4,"good read, but Child has done better","This book had all the makings of a good thriller read. It had an interesting storyline that was different than many other books on the shelf. Child has a knack of dreaming up strange locational situations, this one being deep under the sea, often trapping his characters into their fate. This was a good beach book."
3,"Good story, not my genre.","If you like sci-fi and don't mind a somewhat slowly developing story, this is a great book to listen to.I really liked the narrator - and I probably wouldn't have finished the book if I didn't. I'm not at all a sci-fi fan, and the slow pace had me knowing the big revelations 9/10 times before they were actually revealed. It was a good plot with interesting, and from what I could tell accurate, bits of science thrown in the mix."
4,Follows Classic Thriller Format - But it didn't thrill me,"I am a big fan of Preston and Child when they write together. Their solo efforts are usually not up to their combined skills. This is no exception. Story arc, speed, and characterizations come out of the Thriller 101"" genre style. Nothing really surprised me. The science premise was interesting, but there was nothing that gave me the ""I can't put it down"" feeling. Good fun but nothing exceptional."
4,Deep Storm Review,"I found the story very entertaining and a quick read. The story opened on an oil rig, that day was like any other day, until something bad happened. Almost 2 years later Peter Crane is hired to work on a secret project involving the oil rig. There are many twists and turns to keep the reader interested. Once you are caught up in the book, you'll find it hard to put down.Xiii"
1,Huge Disappointment! don't bother.,"From the jacket description I thought this sounded like an interesting story line but it disappoints right from the start, the only thing that kept me going was to find out what ludicrous twist he'd add next or what implausible situation would confront the one dimensional predictable characters next.Why do so many authors seem to refuse to use an editor or ignore their suggestions? Easily 20% of this book was extraneous and could have been eliminated.Where it wasn't just completely laughable,the science was inaccurate or incorrect. Too many miraculous rescues, and mystery characters that were never explained, characters that make a brief appearance and then disappear with no explanation.Two thumbs down! Don't bother. What a waste of time."
5,Deep Storm,Another fascinating thriller written my a very imaginative author. He creates stunning visuals along with a suspenseful plot. This scientific thriller will hold your attention to the very end. It certainly did mine.Highly recommended.
2,Deep Storm,This was not one of his best. In fact I found it cumbersome in places and towards the end tedious.
3,"Okay, Too much Tech Talk",The most interesting thing about this book was the details about the underwater dome and it's workings. I also enjoyed learning about the submarine basics. What I didn't like was all of the extreme medical terminology and mathmatical science. It had me skimming through the pages. Very Sci-Fi ! A great read for a math/science and medical buff.
5,Deep Storm,I have always liked the Preston Child collaborations. Now as each has gone on his own(I wonder why?) There is double excitement! This novel reminds very much of THE ICE LIMIT. The best fiction I think always has a sense of misdirection to it as well as hidden information and in this respect Deep Storm is excellent.BILL HASH author of --AMRA available on amazon.com
1,Predictable and fanboyish,"If it had been marketed as a take-off of a 30s pulp adventure novel, then I would have been OK with it. Admiral 'Spartan' on a trillion-dollar seabed laboratory? Give me a break. Lincoln, you can and have done better."
1,Disappointed,I was totally engrossed with the story - until near the end when I found out what's buried beneath the earth. Totally lame. That's the best he could come up with?
5,A heart-stopper from start to finish.,Lincoln Child's DEEP STORM receives Scott Brick's vivid reading and tells of a naval doctor summoned to a remote oil platform in the ocean to help diagnose a strange medical condition spreading through the rig. His arrival reveals a deeper danger affecting a research facility built two miles under the surface and leads Dr. Crane to Deep Storm and its dangerous discovery in this gripping thriller which is a heart-stopper from start to finish.
2,The most amazing thing about this book was,that half the readers gave it 5 stars! I gave it 2 stars because it was'nt quite bad enough to stop reading half-way through.
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"I was in the mood for a fast thriller and i wasn't dissapointed, i read the book in 2 days, it kept me going until the end, and speaking of the end, the last chapters is very thought provoking, it give me chills. If you enjoyed this book, check out James Rollins, same type of andrenaline rush when you read his books."
4,sci fi stangeness,"As usual Child writing is excellent,however,his plot stretches the imagination a bit.Nevertheless, I enjoy good writing and Child always delivers."
3,Good with reservations,"I love Lincoln Child's books and have read all of them. I anticipated the ending from the beginning, but it was a fun read with the adventure to the ending very exciting.Spednic"
5,Dark pleasure,"Before you pick up the book, take care of the following: Have plenty drinks, food and time at hand, lock all doors; disconnect the Internet and your phone; then you are ready to read. That is the only way to really ride the Deep Storm. I love the books by Child, because they are informative without being patronising and entertaining from start to finish. One feels like being there with the characters in the story all the time.What to say about the hardcover large print? Don't knock it until you have tried it. I must be old school; I hate soft cover books because they don't last long."
2,"Would make a good movie, but . . .","If you've seen The Abyss then don't bother. This is good for some who are new to reading fiction that turns into sci-fi, but frankly there are a TON of better writers in this genre. Big groaner at the end, and I was sorry I wasted my time."
5,A good collection,"Collected works of Jack London have been reprinted in a variety of editions. It is a good collection to add to any library. Jack London (1876-1916) was born John Griffith Chaney to an unwed mother. He is known to have associated with the rougher elements of society and went to Alaska in 1897 in the early stages of the gold rush, returning a year later broke and in ill health. Most of his writing used the Yukon and Alaska as a setting, although some material is undoubtedly drawn from other sources as well. The description of the town used in one of his short stories fits in well with what he would have observed during his stopover in my hometown in Washington State. He is generally regarded as an author/adventurer, and his novels and short stories have endured the test of time, being as popular now as when they were written. Like many artists and writers, his life was somewhat short."
4,Reality or Fantasy... Which one is it?,"After reading this book for school, (not that I was forced to) I gave it a 4/5 star rating. It was excellent when it came to the setting of the story. Even though it is a very short, it crams alot of suspensfull and interesting moments into 100 some odd pages. This book is quite good and page turning. I highly recommend it to readers who like a mix of reality and fantasy in one. Masterful piece of writing."
5,Best shoes I have ever owned,"I have bought many pairs of $100-$150 pairs of Nike, Adidas, and Reebok shoes. These are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I had a pair of black ones that I wore daily until they fell apart, took about 2 1/2 yrs. The shoes do fit quite snug for the first month or so. My biggest complaint is that Merrell stopped making this shoe. If you like them, spend the money and buy a second pair right away. I bought two more pairs off Amazon as soon as I found out that Merrel stopped making them. The loop on the back did tear on one of the new shoes the other night, but it was probably b/c I was using the loop to pull the shoes on. Merrell's replacement...theMen's Merrell Chameleon3 Stretchis not nearly as comfortable in my opinion. The Chameleon III has a hard plastic piece on the back of the shoe that can dig into your heal."
1,Pittsburgher checks it out...,"My wife wanted copies of this book for her 90 year old somewhat senile aunt. She also got a copy for her brother who grew up in Wilkensburg. I spent some time looking the book over and noted that the ""now"" photos are somewhat obsolete. IMHO it is a good start, especially with the photos of areas ""near and dear"" to the author. Unfortunately, he is from the south hills and I grew up in the north hills."
2,Serious sizing problem on beautiful sunglasses,"These are almost child's-face sized, and that is not indicated. Returned - and I do not have a wide face. Measurements should be in the description, or some indicator that these are definitely for a SMALL face!Serengeti makes fabulous sunglasse: just look for some that show measurements or face size estimates, please."
3,zut alors,"All the hype over Yquem. It is overpriced as a wine, and the new owner Louis Vuitton is purposely limiting production to jack up the prices. In all seriousness Chateau Reiussec is just as good. I've had Yquem dating back to 1966, when I bought a case lot for about $15 a bottle as a PLCB closeout! I recently bought vintage 2000 for $275 for a 375ml. bottle. Compare that to vintage 2000 Royal Tokaji Essencia at $500! Even Tokaji Aszu 6 Puttanyos makes Yquem pale.It may be a pretty coffee table book on Yquem, but it is a vastly over-rated wine."
3,Enjoyable but without factual substance,"Full of an actor's passion but lacks finite substance. The author would have done well to have read the landmark ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard Patton before attempting this immense subject. As an actor's piece this could be a tour de force, but as a novel it seems a little too self-conscious. Enjoyable but does little to further our knowledge."
4,Wonderful first novel,"Every once in a while, I go into a bookstore looking for new authors to add to my collection. Most of the time, the paperbacks I buy end up in the resell pile - but this one won a permenant space on my bookshelf! Finished in less than a day, I was caught by the characters and had to finish it before I went to bed. Not that it doesn't have a few flaws, but I look forward to Ms. Fitch's next effort with anticipation! Way to go!"
2,OK for the price,"These are probably square enough for most people, but not anywhere close to true square when compared to a quality machinist square."
2,Not Stainless Steel!,"I received these squares yesterday. I cannot vouch for their accuracy, but I have to say that they are falsely advertised. They are not stainless steel but just plain old steel (that can rust). False advertising is not nice!"
5,very high quality product at a great price.,the product came to the house very fast and when it came it was better then I expected. The squares were very square and made of high quality materials . Much better then I would have expected for the low price that I paid.
2,Mismatched,"Not only were the components of the rack made of cheap metals, the package had a copper rack, brass chains, and mismatched hooks. All together, looked like an unattractive ensemble."
4,Excellent solution,"Great solution to a big problem...My only complaint is this: Ceiling joists are 16"" on center.. but the holes for the mounting hooks are more near the center of the bracket which forces the chains to slope out away (laterally) from the unit unless you use the provided wall plugs. Basically, it will look like this \___/ I wouldn't recommend using wall plugs on something like this, as it obviously gets pretty heavy.Even if you put one side attached to the joists, that's still too much weight on one side for my taste. However, if you are the slightest bit brave and a tinkerer, like me, just drill the mounting hook holes close to the edge of the unit (just make sure they're even with each other). Then it will look much better and hold all your cooking ware with no worries at all.Otherwise, great product!"
2,Unfortunate,"I would have loved to like this project, but the acting was so poor that I was embarrassed for the film and disappointed that it didn't make sense. It was suppose to be how the teen agers overcame odds to make it out of the wilderness when they became lost. But all they did was bicker and give up. Yes, they were all believers and there was prayer by the towns people, but nothing showing the graciousness and majesty of the human spirit. I was very disappointed."
5,"LOVED, LOVED IT!!","This movie is incredible! The scenery breathtaking!! The plethora of emotions is a tangible... I laughed in the beginning and then cried, then prayed, then cried some more.... What a fabulous job this group of kids did!! The community should be proud of what they accomplished... My hope is that it will touch everyone's life and see the truth of being who you are, where ever you are... Praise God!! A MUST SEE!!!"
5,"Not your typical Christian film, its better!",Who knew a group of kids from a small town in Alaska could work so hard and make such a great movie. With a story line much like an after school special it takes a turn not expected as the kids discover what they are made of and their own faith.
2,Nice ring,"Nice ring for the price. I did have to do some alteration on the ring though. The wings are very sharp and pointy and jabbed into my finger. So I took some tweezers and bent the tops out just a little bit, then I took an emery board and filed the wings down, making them have blunt edges instead of sharp edges.All the alterations did not effect the look or fit of the ring at all, just the comfort level.I would recommend this product, just be aware you might have to do some adjusting yourself."
5,"Great Graphics, Great Game",I personly love this game. I have an old computer thats 10 years old and the graphics are still awesome. I like the movie and the game.
4,"Of all the pulp novels I&#65533;ve read, this may be the pulpiest.","More willing dames, more violence, more doublecrosses, more plot twists, more death, more coincidences and a quicker pace than just about anything else out there.Here's a brief outline:IntroSlang (throughout)SexFightSexDoublecrossPlot twistViolencePlot twistSexMurderMurderDoublecrossCoincidenceViolencePlot twistSexViolencePlot twistCoincidenceDeathDoublecrossDoublecrossPlot twistViolencePlot twistCoincidenceDeathSolutionSexGet the picture? Fun trash."
1,Not worth your time,This book was slow and boring. I love to read but when I started to read this book I kept putting it back down.I eventually just put it away and found something better to read.
3,Interesting,"I purchased this book for myself because I am fascinated by organized crime. This was a fairly interesting account of the woman's role in ""modern"" US mafia. I wish the information was more in-depth, but it was an enjoyable read none the less."
4,Great clipper!,"I am a cosmetologist and use this clipper at work. It is very good. Lots of power but doesn't feel like it is going to jump out of your hand. Found that the blades switch out with my professional set that quit working and cost 3 times as much and had less power. Will buy again.I gave it 4 stars because there is a bit of drag (not the motor but the back of the blade) when shaving the neck and will occassionally pinch the customer, no blood though. But overall, great clipper."
4,Lamp,I purchased this item to add a light to an apartment I lived in. The quality was great for the price and it looked great for its intended purpose.
4,Would buy more if possible,"The All Clad set of canisters runs $100 or more. I believe I bought this set for $15. It is now discontinued, but if I could I would love to buy 2-5 more sets as gifts and to use as well."
1,Self Propell function does not work,Reconditioned Hoover Self Propell does not work! The Hoover smells like the rubber belt is burning. The only way I could get it to work was not use the self propell function. I would like to know how to get it fixed or return it. I've only used it twice and the 2nd time was a night mare.
1,Noisy and Squeals,"I have had this machine for less than 2 years and already replaced both belts twice and the brush once. Now its ready again. After having it less than 1 month the squealing started, usually going backwards. Replaced the belts and it seems ok again for a few weeks then it starts again. This thing is terrible. I don't care who made it (probably China or Mexico} I'll never have another HOOVER!"
2,missing Part,"We recieved the vacuum on time. Unfortunately, when it arrived there was a large sticker covering and adjustment knob. When the sticker was removed, it became evident that the knob was missing. While it is not a critical feature to operate the vacuum, it is still a big disappointment."
1,Dont waste your time and money,"This product is sub standard to begin with, and add the recondition factor, not a good purchase for me. 20 words to describe this vacuum product .. I dont think it takes more than one word ..Pass."
5,Great book and full of knowledge,I purchased this book for school and i am glad i did. The book full of knowledge and pictures. I kept the book after i was done with the class because of how much i liked it. Even if you want something to read for fun this book is it.Buy this book and enjoy yourself.
5,GREAT DEAL,"The item was a little slow getting here, but I understand this was due to inclimant weather and had nothing to do with the seller.The book is in good shape and the price was good.Yes - I would buy from this dealer again."
4,Good condition Astronomy book,I received this book in the mail a couple days before it was expected. I'll probably keep it instead of selling it back at the end of the year like I usually do with my textbooks.
1,Most Irritating Game of the Year,"I'm not a fan of recorded-noise games, but my daughter got this one as a gift. The voice over gets old after the 2nd or 3rd time, and you have to listen to it on every turn. The worst, though, is the CONSTANT snare drum and high-hat back beat. Also, the age recommendation of 6+ is silly since my 5-yr old daughter had it mastered in less than 5 minutes. This is definitely a toy that will get ""lost"" in the holiday chaos."
1,Horrible!,I wish we had played it before we threw the box away. It definitely would have been returned to the store. It is completely stupid!
4,An okay game.,"We purchased this game after Christmas on sale and I won't say we are dissapointed with it, however, we also received other games that were a lot more fun, such as Yahtzee Turbo. This is a fun game and we will play it but it doesn't seem to be one of the first choices of games for the family to play."
4,Good Game,"I have to start off by saying that the constant snare drum and high-hat are very annoying. You can only listen to it for so long. And this is coming from someone who's dh plays the drums all the time. Besides this ""problem"" the game is very fun. The family likes to play...even my 4 year old can get into the action."
3,Not what I thought but still a fun game,"The game itself is pretty simple but correlating to the old Trouble game, it's nothing like it - which I was disappointed in. Love the original Trouble game--- this game has a twist of it's own but not that difficult."
2,Worst game ever!,I purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift. As a toy it looks really cool. As a game it's not. The directions are not very specific and their really is no strategy needed to play. Stick to the classic version.
4,great game!!!,"We played this game with cousins after Christmas. We thought it was a lot of fun and we are buying one of our own. The recorded voice may get somewhat annoying but it was drowned out by our laughter and the game is a lot of fun. If you don't like a little noise, you should sick to boring card games."
4,Fine biography,"As reviewer Carter points out, this book is a biography of Kristian Birkeland, not a scientific treatise on the Northern Lights. And as reviewer Hoge points out, the writing style is more mainstream pop than dry academia. Personally, I found it quite readable. I'm not doing serious research on the subject, so I was fine with being entertained while I learned a little more about how the scientific community worked at the dawn of the 20th century. The primary criticism I have is that Jago was rather biased in favor her subject-- maybe justifiably so, but her flag waving was a little too blatant for me at times... Also, she stretched her material a bit, probably could have been a shorter book. Still, if you enjoyed books like Sobel's ""Longitude"" or Larson's ""Devil in the White City,"" you'll probably enjoy ""Northern Lights."""
5,Thank you for writing this book!,"Dear Lucy Jago,I really enjoyed this book! I read the complete title so I knew it was about the MAN who unlocked the secrets of the Aurora Borealis... not about the ""powerful and mystical Northern Lights"". What an amazing man he must have been. Thanks for showing us his human side, strengths and weaknesses. I'm still left wondering what else he might have been able to accomplish if he had lived longer (and had a more healthy life style!)I thought this book had a good balance between the technical aspects and storytelling. I didn't want a physics book about Aurora, if I did, then I would have gotten one. I wanted a history of science book, I wanted to know the ""story"", I wanted to meet the people, I wanted to know the community reaction at the time. I got all that and more.Thanks for your fine work, I had an enjoyable few hours reading it."
3,This isn't the Discovery Channel....,"The Author's Note says ""to prevent the book becoming an academic text ...I have kept references to a minimum and there are no footnotes."" After 30 pages, I flipped to the back cover and learned the author is a ""former documentary producer"" - Bingo! If you like your science easy - preferably seated on your couch watching the discovery channel - this book is for you.However, if you are truly interested in science and are interested in Birkeland's theory in the context of scientific theory in the late 19th century or want to learn about the success of his arctic expeditions compared to Amundsen's or Shackleton's, look elsewhere than this 'novelization' of Birkeland's life."
5,Works great for problems other than graffiti,"My main use for KK-G is to clean various kinds of stains off of my concrete driveway. Spray it on..... let it sit 30 seconds or so.... rinse with the garden hose..... stains are gone.My first experience with it was when the contractor for the new house I had built used it to remove wood stain from the concrete front porch. As I watched him spray this stuff on the stains, I had serious doubt that it would work, but work it did, and effortlessly at that.A great product, and a must-have for anyone wanting to keep their concrete stain-free. While there may be other products that can handle this task, I cant imagine anything doing it as easily as KK-G does that's also non-toxic so as to not harm any of our pets and the environment."
2,Didn't work on cement al all,"It says it works on cement. After applying and brushing the surface, 96% of the paint was still there. Maybe it works better on non-porus materials/surfaces."
2,Paint didn't come off,Followed instructions and nothing happened. So I had to do it atleast 5 more times to get the graffiti slightly off. Looks like I will need to do this in stages. Doesn't come off on my wall.
5,It Works!,"When some local miscreants applied their graffiti around our neighborhood recently, it was time to take immediate action. I ordered Krud Kutter GR32 Graffiti Remover from Amazon! Using Krud Kutter GR32 was a snap: a quick spray, wait 60 seconds and wipe off with a rag did the trick. It's amazing to watch the ink and paint melt away with GR32. This product removed permanent ink from aluminum light poles, community mailboxes and painted cable TV boxes. It even works on spray paint. For a few stubborn areas, I simply used a Scotchbrite sponge to scrub a bit. Thanks Krud Kutter - your product will keep our neighborhood clean for years to come."
4,A different take on an old fairy-tale - a scary one!,"Galen Sword is searching for entrance back to the First World, home to vampires, shifters, elementals, and...other...things. Although he was born to this realm, Sword was banished as a child, due to a lack of inherent magical talent. Assisted by a hostile mechanical expert, a paralyzed genius, and a young halfling girl with unusual abilities, he seeks to find his family in the face of opposition more than capable and fully willing to eliminate him.Now, he's found that shapeshifters are real, and may hold the key to his success. He must infiltrate their ranks at a time when they are strongest. He's willing to risk it all - but will he emerge from what promises to be the biggest challenge of his life?"
5,Learning with fun...,P.S. There is a booklet of references included with many listings. But it is not updated for this version. Brain science has developed a lot just in the past few years.
3,"Terrific music, poorly recorded","This is a real shame. It's a compilation of terrific songs, but very poorly recorded. Sound quality is really lacking. Would love to buy a new, improved re-issue."
5,Heartfelt Christmas Season story,"Beautiful .... My family enjoyed this on Christmas Eve. Simple, yet so heartwarming. I would love to give copies to all of my friends and family members for their home libraries."
2,Poorly done and just plain weird,"I had hoped this would be one of those little known Christmas classics to my list, but this was just poorly done and weird. I think this may have been part of a Mormon event, but I didn't think it seemed like a Mormon thing. However, the film is certainly a big let down and not like a class Christmas movie."
3,Meh.,"A half decent, but too short, xmas movie that's a lot on the preachy. This disc is also contains mormon propaganda."
5,Mr Krugers Christmas,"THIS IS AN ALL TIME CLASSIC WITH JIMMY STEWART IN IT, HEART WARMING STORY WE HAVE THIS ON VHS BUT NEED IT TO BE A DVD FOR OUR DVD PLAYERWE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR 25 YEARS EVERY CHRISTMAS, IT HAS BROUGHTA TEAR TO MY EYE IN ONE PART OF THE STORY, IT IS WONDERFULL FOR ALL AGES"
5,I love her carpetry skills,"I love Mary Ann Mitchell books, but they are hard to find. She is a must read author as long as you don't mind any steamy action"
3,Good reading,"Hi. Well all books are different. It is a stretch of a very imaginative mind. I enjoyed reading this book. I have yet to be disappointed by Mary Ann Mitchell's writing. The products, all books, I have bought from Amazon have been in good condition. Thanks PSM:)"
5,Anointed!,"I love the songs on this album and how Keith once again focuses all on the Good Shepherd, our Lord Jesus. The songs are timeless, the anointing is fresh even after all the years since they were written. I think that's a sure sign of anointing is to see the fruit remain."
4,does its job,"good price for a copper bowl - rounded bottom requires a towel to sit on if you want to walk away from it, but other than that its great."
2,Beware!,Bowl have a protective coating that can't be taken off withOut using harsh paint remover or varnish stripper. The bowls can not be used utill coating is removed. The instructions actully tell you to go to Home Depot or other home store to buy steel wool and stripper.
1,The lacquer coating defeats the purpose of using a copper bowl.,Copper bowls with lacquer make them no different than regular plastic bowls.The coppper in real copper bowls helps create a tighter chemical bond in reactive sulfur items such as egg whites. The bond created is so tight that the sulfurs are prevented from reacting with any other material. This gives you the stiff peaks you're looking for. Cream of tartar does the same thing. Use a lacquered bowl and you might as well be using a cheap $5 plastic bowl.
4,To remove protective varnish...,"I have just ordered the 10"" copper bowl, so don't have any feedback on the quality yet. I intend on using the bowl for egg whites, etc., so I contacted Old Dutch International on what to use to remove the varnish. Their recommendation was a product called ""The Premium Stripper SR72"" aerosol that they said was available at Home Depot. Leave it on for 20 minutes then wash off with warm water and dry well.(Had to put in some stars to post this, so will put in 4 so that I don't mess up the average too much. Will try to update this when I actually receive my bowl...)"
5,Superb Bowl,"Very good bowl for beating egg whites, and reasonably priced. The one I got was not coated so perhaps that isn't a problem now. Get a big whisk to go with the bowl."
5,best ever car wax,this is the only car wax i have found that will put a great shine on my old 92 ford ranger.i can't find it any where here. i have tried many . will use nothing else!!!!!!
3,"Good, comprehensive, little outdated","This book is well written. My interest was just the MIDI message format. This book has lot more than that and focus on the message format was not as much as I needed. If your focus is MIDI message format and in-depth analysis of that, this probably is not the most suitable. A larger overview is covered well in this. The pictures and the hardware discussed in this book are outdated."
5,Perfect Kwanzaa Story,"Unlike the average book on Kwanzaa that gives basic information on the seven principles with a contemporary flair, this book takes a historical African centered approach."
3,Scientists DO know .....,"Obviously the main reviewer did not do a simple google search, because if he did he would know that scientists do indeed know why egg whites whip up better in copper bowls: check out chemistry.about.com/library/weekly/blcopperegg.htm (no www.). And the rounded bottom is also helpful for whipping egg whites, although not for setting the bowl on a table or counter."
4,Nice surprise.,"I ordered these for display only. I was surprised to read about having to remove the coating before use, but what the heck I was using them to hang on my kitchen wall anyway. I am very pleased with this product that cost me so little!!!"
3,Description of Bowls,"Why doesn't the advertisement for the copper bowls show the size in pints, quarts, or quart and half instead of giving just size in inches. It appears your selling them for decoration purposes only."
3,Disappointed with finish,"This is one item that looks much better in the picture than it does close up. I was very disappointed with the finish on the set i reeived - the shiny finish has several nicks, scrapes and runs (similar to paint when you apply too much). Also these are 18/10 stainless steel - heavier than 18/8 but they dont feel like they have the weight that 18/10 should (and the other 18/10 products I own). I gave them 3 stars mostly on value - if you would buy similiar tools individually, they would cost 10 per tool so you get this complete set for cost of 1 1/2 tools. If you are just looking for functionality and dont care about how they look close up, they are a good buy.4/1 Update - one other thing to note, just used the large fork to hold a 4lb roast beef while slicing and the flat edge on the handle of the fork dug into my finger painfully. Didnt change my 3* rating, since the fork is ok for light use or you could throw it away and still have paid a decent price for the set."
2,NOT CHLORINE FREE!!!!,"I called the parent company to confirm that the diapers are chlorine free, as implied by the label which says ""TCF- made from totally chlorine free woodpulp'. However, I was told that in fact the diapers contain chlorine-bleached cotton, and thus are NOT CHLORINE FREE. I resent that the way this is phrased on the packaging seems to be intentionally misleading. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because they don't leak, and don't contain gel. The tabs are poorly designed though...if you get even a touch of diaper cream on them, they no longer stick. I'm switching to cloth washed at home by me--it's the only gel-free, chlorine-free way I can find to diaper my baby. I wish someone would make a gel-free, chlorine-free disposable..."
4,Good experience in general,"Used cloth for first 2 months with Tushies at night which worked out great. Started using Tushies exclusively after that. Like the diaper, gel free, soft and comfortable, but don't believe the size if your baby is chubby. We bought way too many small size that supposedly go to 14 lbs. Our girl was 12lb13oz at 2 months and hard to get a tight fit at the waist. Had a couple leaks. Now she is pooing only 2-3 times a day seems she has a blow out about once daily out the leg or back - reason only giving 4 stars. Hopefully the medium size will fit better."
4,Tushies Diapers,"I bought these for my grandson. My daughter loves the idea that they are better for the environment but we find that because they don't absorb as well he wets through more often, especially at night. I would suggest using a night time diaper at night and Tushies during the day."
1,Leaks a lot,"I found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers. I was impressed and eager to try Tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them, I ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby. The diapers came sooner then expected, which was great. My single star rating comes from my experience using them. They have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit. It seems like no matter how tight I can get the diapers my son leaks through them, out the sides and up the belly. Because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash- his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week."
3,BEST gel free diaper but LEAKS,"I use cloth diapers 90% of the time, but sometimes want a disposible when travelling. I like that these are unbleached and gel-free, but I have had three very gross and embarrassing leaks with poo blow outs. Once, it leaked onto my lap and through to the car seat, so when I got up, it looked like I had the accident! Still using them with a diaper wrap until I can find a better gel-free alternative."
1,"Hard as a rock, burned his tushie!","Ordered Tushies ""No-Gel"" Sposies from Amazon. I ordered a size 2 12-24 lbs, he is about 14 lbs.) , probably should have got a size 1 because the diapers literally came up to his armpits. The diaper looked super archaic, not like the ""cloth like diaper"" they said it would be like. Since it doesn't have gel, it has super thick cotton, which was absorbant but not soft at all and not very pliable. I used about 5 diapers on him and it burned his tushie really bad. Poor thing, he almost had a blister. These are supposed to be more natural but he hasn't had a reaction this bad in his Huggies. Needless to say I am giving Amazon these diapers back. They sent me 4 packs, I am sending them back 3. Free shipping on the return and full refund. Love Amazon, Hate Tushies."
2,Hopelessly outdated,"I expected this book to be a sort of manual on escaping from prisons. There is some information on modern prisons but not much. The book dwells mainly on WWII POW camp escape techniques. For example, the section on forgery of passes spends the entire chapter talking about how allied POWs forged passes and papers, and then finishes with the paragraph ""The forging techniques of those days were adequate for the era. Today, it would be almost impossible to produce passable forgeries of most I.D. documents."" I expect that this book was really written with a different title and different pitch, focusing on WWII POW history, but that the publisher persuaded the author to add a paragraph here and there about modern prisons and change the title, so that it could be marketed as a prison escape technique book."
2,Not as expected,"The book was interesting reading, but most of it seemed informational and entertaining rather than practical. I will have to put off my crime spree until a better book comes out... If interested in the topic read ""The Great Escape"" by Paul Brickhill. It is a much more entertaining book and Mr Lesce seems to have taken most of his information for there anyway."
2,OK,"This book is ok, but it seems to concentrate more on the prison camps, than prisons or jails. However, it gives s few good ideas on picking handcuff locks, and get this......they work!"
1,This a very weak book,"The major problem with this book is that it lacks a sound theory. It is based on circumstancial evidence, which is highly anectodal in nature and does not say anything new or anything interesting. The old 'customer this and that' stuff. Only the title of the book is interesting but I reccommed you avoid this and don't fall in the trap provided by the title. I unfortunately did and terribly regret it."
5,Read it twice... So far.,"This is an MBA in a book!Calloway skillfully handles the complexities of a changing business landscape and zeros-in on three game-changer ideas that will create, in your organization, a Category of One culture.I especially liked reading the section on ""tie-breakers"". You might want to read that section first. It's probably not what you think."
1,Poor quality wheelbarrow,"I got this wheelbarrow for my wife and it arrived with a large split on the side of the box and a chunk of wood broke off of the handle/axle support where the hole is for the axle. Bargain Outfitters contacted the vendor, who sent replacement parts that were as bad as the broken originals. The end of the replacement handle/axle support had a chunk of wood broken off the end where the axle hole should have been, but they didn't even drill it. The replacement box side had a knot in the middle of it that went all the way through (can see through it) like a 2"" hole. We figured the vendor was messing with us for complaining, or just getting a laugh out of sending us these parts because it is a joke what they sent. This is very poorly made. They sent me a return label, so I hope the refund goes well. We went to an antique shop and bought a well made one for about the same price if you factor in shipping."
2,Great lamp--IF YOU DON'T USE LIGHTBULBS!,"Very pretty lamp with a good, solid base. Unfortunately, once you screw the lightbulbs in they descend below the rim of the lamp so you're met with tons of glare any time you look in the lamp's direction. Clearly, someone did not think things through. I have the same problem with a second lamp I bought. And the third takes 15-w candelabra bulbs that I cannot find anywhere. I feel as though I've just wasted $200 and am very disappointed."
3,Not bad.,"CLAMP, xxxHolic vol. 1 (Tokyopop, 2004)Despite the title, xxxHolic is the story of a guy who can see spirits. When he finds himself at the house of a witch/mystic who may be able to help him, she manipulates him into working for her as payment for removing the curse. Not a bad beginning, but reserving judgment until I've seen more. ***"
4,I love this series,This is my second copy of Vol. 1. I recently found my first copy damaged :\ and I noticed with this one its cover is different. Now i'm worried the story may be different... I guess we'll see.
3,Not the Best in This Series,"This is not the best book in this series but is serviceable. The story is very linear and there are no surprises or plot twists. It was the first published by this author of this series, and they do get better. The point of view changes between the characters unnecessarily, which makes reading a bit awkward. Don't quit on this series, there are several good ones, and none I have read as bad as this one."
2,Whahuh?,"This isn,t a bad book, but I really expected a tale involving a lot of different undead types, and instead I found the group was facing little more than a Wight. No offense, but there a plenty scarier undead to choose from than wights. The tale isn't bad and some of the characters are fun, but the story is rushed, told in well under 300 pages. Had I known I was paying six bucks for a book under three hundred pages I would have thought twice before making a purchase. As it is, I will say away from TH Lain's Penny Dreadfuls that cost a dollar. Definately a throw away tale, as I read this a month ago and cannot recall a single character's name.Not a bad read, just not worth the cover. 2 stars for shortness of story and forgettable characters."
2,"Fun, but too much predictable","This is a book fun to read, fighting undead with inspired melody, magic spell and enchanted sword. But probably it has too much ""fun"", i.e. not only one but two main characters both got naked and then subsequencely even running naked across the whole town.The already shorten story line is also too much predictable, IMHO. I believe I guess 90% of the ending when I just finished about 1/3 of the book. Along with the main characters, there are too many secondary characters, and most of them are very ""short lived"", and not being described in much more details than just one or two sentences. According to the ""tradition"" of this series, i.e. no more than 200 pages for each title, this shortcoming might be a given.Overall, this is not a bad book, it is fun and no brainer, but this title might be the worst in this series so far. 1.5 stars if I could give."
1,UGH!,This book is horrible.Fans of D&D will every disapointed (The main enemy is a CR 3 Wight?)Thia is also extremly inapropriate for children under 12. anyone older than this should not be reading this junk anyway. Awful just awful. First the main characters get drunk! GASP! Then comes a naughty part which i feel I cannot tell you about online. Look at reviews under mine to find out.This boook is also rediculos. So the little young gnome cleric turns out to be a anicent elf cleric? The wizzard gets a potion and now she can only say things like Banna Wheelbarow Potato? Dont waist ur money. This book would be over priced at 1.99!!! Go read something better. Like The wheel of time.
2,RF Interference vacuum,DO NOT buy these speakers if you live near an RF interference source. Bought these for the computer I built for my 11 year old son and the only sound that comes out of them is a loud hum and bleedover from the radio station down the road. Have no problems with the Altec Lansing AVS300 2.1 system on my other son's computer or any of my stereo or electric guitar equip. The AVS300 runs off an AC adapter while this set gets its juice straight from the wall outlet. I expect that's what the problem is...tried different power strips etc but these speakers still suck up any and all RF and turn it into the most awful noise. Shipping them off to my step sister's kids in New England because they are totally unuseable at my house.
2,"Distortion, pics up cell phone intereference",I'm using this system with a Dell Dimension 2400 PC. The sound from the tweeters is distorted and the bass can be booming. I'm an electrical engineer so I have a clue. If you have an alternate choice I suggest you take that.
1,Horrible,"As many have noticed, this system has serious interference issues. There is a constant loud humming sound , and radio interference in both speakers. I have tried putting in multiple RF chokes on all the wires in vain. I spent only $20 on it through rebates, and i am glad that i did not have to shell out 50 bucks for it! Maybe if you live in the middle of nowhere with no radio station around for 100s of miles, it might work well...."
2,Looks can be deceiving...,"I bought these speakers from an electronic's store nearby a few months ago for its looks and price, and after about 3 months, the left speaker blew out! I also found this annoying humming noise that appears whenever i place my cell phone or homephone by them. It really bothers me. Also, when someone calls, it begins humming even before i hear the ring. As i was looking at the other reviews, i believe that its because of the air waves - transmissions. It is a good price, but not worth it for long - term use."
2,"Good sound, but don't use a cell phone near them.","I bought these from a local retail store. They sound great. Except when my downstairs neighbor uses her cell phone. A very loud buzzing/beeping occurs at seemingly random intervals. This happens even when the power is off! I suspect that the cable between the controls and the subwoofer is picking up some kind of interferance...and that the stupid subwoofer is always powered on.Tired of crawling under the desk a few times a day to unplug these things, I smashed them with a hammer and called it even."
4,A excelent product,"This product is excelent, the live center fits rigt in the lathe rod and is free of rust"
5,This is the best investment I have made on the boat since the drain plug. JK,I fish in an area that has many tributaries and is very easy to get lost. It does not have maps. But the breadcrumb tracking is just as good. I couldnt' see spending almost a 1000 for a gps. You can zoom in on the breadcrumb and it is easy to follow your previous track. You can also save waypoints and setpoints with this unit. It takes 2-3 minutes to locate its self so when I take the boat off of the trailer i cut it on and by the time I park the trailer and come back its ready. I jug fish where you are setting sets of gear. The Fishfinder with this can make temp. waypoints and it really helps when the chop starts. On a jonboat you cant find the gear unless you are ontop of it so i have found that feature really nice.
1,Rip Off,"I paid a premium for special handling. The ad makes you think you will get the items you ordered via overnight or 2nd day shipping. I received the single item via standard UPS, days late. The premium shipping costs was more than the Tea Bags I ordered. Shame of me- Buyer beware and read the ads very closely.I will pay a doublem premium before I send this company any of my money again."
5,My fave everyday tea!,"I am so glad Amazon does this grocery ordering now. It is so hard to find this tea in DC, it was everywhere in NYC when I lived there. It is great stuff!"
2,Old dutch pedestal copper colander,"The recommended lacquer remover for this item was not available in our area. We tried to order it from several places and finally used another product. The lacquer was difficult to remove.The colander arrived slightly dented and holds a little water but we decided not to try to return it. Some of the interior finish lifted off the first time I drained pasta in it and has continued to erode with use.I use it because I gave away my stainless steel one when I got this one, but I'm not happy with it. I suppose it would be a nice decorative piece if you left the lacquer on it, but I really cook and use my kitchen ware every day and I am disappointed with this item. I don't even care that it may not be shiney, I just wonder why the nickel lining came off so quickly."
2,"Looks great, performs terribly!","How can a colander, a simple kitchen tool, not do its job properly??? Well, this is a beautiful shiny copper colander that is very decorative, but as soon as we drained pasta in it, the colander became horribly discolored and stained. Despite repeated scrubbings and polishing, it still has slight stains. Now it is a large ornamental item on my pot rack."
5,Great music from great writers.,Well what did I expect! It's a greatest hits from a great pair of writers. I love every track. My only wish is that they would have included Dear Madam Barnum! Oh Well. Still one of my favorite discs from one of my favorite bands!!!!!
4,Danger massive tweeter burn,"I like the music on this collection. However the sound quality is uneven. The treble on ""The Mayor Of Simpleton"" for example is blistering. Not all cuts suffer from this problem so if you intend to listen to the songs back to back you will need to repeatedly adjust your eq to make things bearable."
4,The Kings of Quirk,"Lets face it "" guitars are here to stay, and guitar pop is showing no signs of going quietly into that good night. So fans being raised on Strokes, Travis, Coldplay etc. are hereby advised to check out Britains best guitarpop ever, with perhaps the exception of the Smiths. This is as good a place to start as any. With the singles. A peach every one.I really wish more people would give XTC a try. Fans of Britpop Elvis Costello, Squeeze, etc. will find plenty to cheer about. XTC have always been considered just a bit too quirky for mainstream consumption, hence their relative anonymity. But lets face it, no one does ~quirky quite like the English, and no English band does quirky quite as well as XTC."
5,No man is an Island,"I walked away from this book wondering so many things, like: Why is it that the representatives of the Catholic Church refuse to just admit when they have made a mistake? Instead of admitting fallibility with laws on celibacy, they continue to put people through such trials (as was experienced by Fr. and Mrs. Sweeney in this enlightening book), and call upon people to accept and live with those mistakes by justifying them as an act of faith.This book will take the reader upon a perilous journey of the heart and soul. Fr. Sweeney and his wife share the heartbreak and triumph of their relationship and the sacrifices that had to be made so they could be together. But the question you will be left asking is why did they have to sacrifice anything? And when will the Catholic Church stop hurting lives by such an artificial and UN-natural celibacy law that Christ Himself, never set forth into being?"
4,Painful Decisions,"A love story about two people and the sacrifices each had to make in their own life in order to share the rest of thier life together in marriage. The women describes her emotions of resentment, and confusion while the man she loves, a Priest goes through a terrible trial of spriritual probing. His description of his thorough investigation of celibacy laws in the Catholic Church is very enlightening. His personal decisions and how they will affect their future are carefully described....this is a deeply moving story."
1,AN EMBARRASSMENT,"Poorly done in all respects, this book is embarassing in its shallow presentation of its soap-opera authors. I was expecting a real book filled with deep and complex thoughts and emotions, and instead I found merely a very sugary and superficial public relations plea from two very ego-eccentric and self-dramatizing people."
4,small!,"I should have paid more attention to the size- 5""x7"" is pretty small for a mouse pad. They're attractive enough, I just keep running off the edges!"
1,mousepad,"I wasn't happy with the performance of this product. But I decided to keep it in case I do need it for something some day. It arrived in very good condition. But I was ""WOW!"" when I saw it and wished I hadn't purchased it. :-)"
5,PERFECT!!!,"This is a perfect mouse pad for mobile laptops...it's small, portable, and it's pretty. Bought a plain one for my Sony laptop and buying more for my kids."
3,user friendly. poor quality,i bought my x5 the same time video ipod came out and i should have waited for the ipod. the x5 is a great mp3 player but the screen is smaller then ipod. if you want to use the software that came with x5 then you need a PC. i have a imac and none of the software is compatible. the only advantage that x5 has is the built in fm tuner and ability to download pictures directly from digital camera to x5 which i never tried. if i had to choose between ipod and x5 i pick ipod because there is more support and more accesories to choose from.
1,DO NOT BUY !!!,"I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works."
2,"Great MP3, When it Works","I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat. This is a quibble, however, that one can live with. Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good."
5,Great!,"This little unit performs most functions flawlessly. The unit is the same size and approximately the same price, but, performs more functions.The sound is awesome, the ease of use and the ability to accept different formats makes this the palyer for me. I am very pleased with the quality of the photos stored and access very easy to program. I have not been able to upload video clips and need to check for firmware updates, but, this was low on my list of priorities when I purchased the unit.Overall, the construction, fit and finish of the unit is good. The sound and photo abilities are awesome. I would highly recommend this to any friend."
1,bad battery life do not buy,"If you read most of the reviews on this site or on the web you will see that the battery life sucks and you can count on spending $70+ to replace it by sending it to Cowon. The player itself is good, but that's about it. Dont waste your money"
3,not for quality recording,"as a mac user, I cannot use mini discs for quality portable audio recording. the iAudio is one of the FEW mp3 recorders which will work with a mac. Thus, I purchased one hoping it would perform as a high quality recorder and player. The device is limited because it does not record in WAV format (uncompressed). Altho iPod plays WAV it won't do live recordings except in mono with very low bit rate.The line in requires a mic amp as well as the adaptor. Too many connections for a delicate device. The controls are too difficult and the device is too complex for easy use. Would depend on hard drive mechanisms only thru warranty period. Non removable battery, thus, a throw away. I would say the same for many such devices."
5,Great Unit!,"I bought this unit to record microphone audio. Unfortunately, it does not do that. But, it ended up being so incredible for other uses I loved it and kept it anyway. I use it to transport Final CUt pro video projects between home and work. The sound this unit has is a knockout and it records line in signals cleanly and of professional quality. The video screen looks nice and it all fits easily into a pocket. Downside is that there's a plug-in usb/line port you have to use for tranfers, but I think I can get over it because of the positives. Watch out IPOD!"
4,finally breaking,After owning this for more than 3 years it is finally winding down. I replaced the battery after 2 years (simple solder job). Now the headphone jack only play out of one headphone but I tried a simple hack with aluminum foil which is no failing too. I am sad to see this little one go.
4,Awesome product !,"Perhaps this is what Apple was trying to shoot for when they brought out the IPOD....tough luck, the IAUDIO is 10 times better than the IPOD. I not only have music on this thing, but I have also recorded my lectures with no problem and the playback is quite fine...all this done without an external attachment, which is great! The line in recording option makes recording podcast files without a problem and file transfers are no problem.I can't forget to mention the Picture viewing option. The quality isn't too bad when you take into consideration the size of the screen. Perhaps a zoom option would have made this feature a bit more worthwhile.Overall I'm quite pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend purchase of the product, especially when compared to the Apple counterpart."
2,"I love this so much, it hurts me to give it only 2 stars","I've had my X5 for about 15 months now. In that time, I have used it mostly around the house and at the gym. I charge it regularly and use it gently. I chose the X5 because I like the way I have my music organized in folders, and I don't like the way itunes organizes my music. I found the X5 to be very intuitive and user friendly.However, at about 12 months old (just after the warranty expired), my battery life went from 10-15 hours to 2-3 hours (and sometimes less). The unit hasn't been through any trauma to warrant this drop in battery life, and now I am faced with the decision to spend 80 or more dollars to replace it, or to just put that money towards another player.Iaudio states on their website that the battery should be at about 80% at 2 years old. I made my decision based on this information, and I might have gone with another player if I had known my unit would be fairly useless in a year."
5,Great Value!,"The Madeira Thread Treasure Chest is a great value! Madeira is quality thread. This is also available in Polyester at an increased cost. You will love having the full complement of thread colors, including varigated and metallic. Storage chest is great - there is a spot for every thread color. Included is a color card, too. This shows actual thread samples for every thread available in the chest."
4,Looks very stylish on my Lexus,"I love the look of them on my Lexus!! The installation was very simple and strait forward! They look Great!! The one on my passenger side seated great and I have no problems with it. They look much better than the glue on ones!!Now for one not so good thing, the one on my drivers side did not seat all of the way and is still a little loose when the widow is rolled down. It would not allow my window to roll up for a while but it does now. It drops about a 1/4 inch with the window down in the front all of the time. The back side is seated great.It still keeps the rain out and does not look to bad so I'm going to keep it. I just wish it would had done as well as the passenger side.I would recommend this to a friend!"
5,Excellent Movie,"Excellent, excellent movie that really examines the underbelly of the NBA's recent string of shady business practices. Must match for any NBA fan. No team is safe!"
3,Not good for Hip-Hop beats,"Although this is Hip Hop eJay 2, it really isn't all that good for hip-hop beats. The samples are of high quality, but the sounds are better suited for dance, techno, and rave music. If you are into alternative hip-hop music, you might be able to squeeze a couple of tracks out of the samples. Overall, it is a pretty good product."
4,Its ok,"The program is ok, i mean it could still stand to be better. There are more lines to work with than HHeJay did. The beat creator is pretty tight thought. Insted of usen the already made bites, make your own, record off a cd then put it into a beat...it sounds tight if you put a lot of effort into it. but its an ok program...nothen to really complain about."
3,"close, no cigar","The form is the biggest I could locate on line, and it works very well. It was a nuisance to have to prepare it for use. As I understood it, there is a coating put on the copper to keep it shiny. This is meant for those who want it for decoration only. For people like me, who have several copper and copper bottomed pots, keeping the form shiny is not a problem. Taking the coating off WAS.The form holds just 4 cups...which is a bit scance, as most recipes for mousses and such ""create"" 4 cups of mix. Wish there were a bigger form that would allow some leeway as far as content goes."
2,I'm less than thrilled!,"This is very pretty when you remove it from the package. If you want to actually use the mold and not just hang it up for decoration, there are detailed instructions for removing the protective coating. I followed the instructions to the letter, which include boiling the mold, and the finish ended up being marred. I reviewed the instructions. I had done exactly as asked, yet ended up with a less-than-beautiful mold (which I also wanted to hang on the wall when not in use). I have no idea yet as to how it works as a mold, and I'm almost reluctant to try. My advice to the manufacturer: How about making two versions of this - one with coating and one without? That would solve the problem of less-than-successful removal of the coating."
3,Dissapointing Effort,"Yusa's first album was a wonderful experience, but with this new release, she seems to have lost her way. Here she doesn't sound that unique anymore. Compared to her first album, ""Breathe"" is boring. Slow funkyfied songs predominate, and what seemed fresh before, now sounds pretentious."
2,I am not happy with them,"They attach to the machine fine, the hood os hard to tighten correctly, the on/off switch is hard to find, the neck is not very securely mounted to the base causing the light to fall down. Look for something better!"
1,Absolute Garbage!!,"I own many products from Grizzly, including their cabinet table saw, 8"" jointer and 17"" bandsaw, and this is the first time they've sold me a bad product. I would have given it zero stars if I could have.The gooseneck is not secure at the base, and will not stay tightened. The shade collar was broken on both the lamps I bought so that the shade will not stay positioned, the plastic guard around the rim of the shade falls off all the time, and the magnetic base shifts with even the slightest machine vibration.It's a great concept, but the poorest engineering and quality control I've ever seen. Actually pretty surprising, considering the usually very high quality I've come to expect from Grizzly."
1,Neat Idea - But Bad Design!!,"I just bought this, And when you tighten the RED cover to the goose neck, there is only a small brass screw that tightens onto a plastic bulb socket, Very sloppy fit and once you turn it to move the goose neck where you want it, It will crack the Plastic Socket! Very poor design. Its needs to be metal and be clamped on not a screw. Dont waste your money."
3,Short Cord,This product does everything it is supposed to. The magnetic base is great with the on/off switch. I use it mounted to the back verticle face on my band saw and it's great. the only reason I only gave it 3 stars is that I would consider the cord to be too short. I would say it's only about 2 1/2 feet long.
1,They don't work,"My controllers don't work at all when using these extensions but then work perfectly when used without them. I have a 2nd edition NES (the top loading one). Maybe this is the reason they dont work correctly but they should. Still an NES, still same controllers."
3,Works great if you can get it in...,"Receiving end of this extension fits great, but the end going into the NES isn't sized perfectly and requires a good amount of (careful!!!) force to get it in. Once it's in, I wouldn't recommend trying to pull it back out. Controls work just fine with it though."
5,Perfect length,Nothing compares to a good game of Faxanadu while kicked back in a comfortable recliner.This product will let you do it.Update 10-24-2010:Still using it regularly!
3,Just OK,"I was expecting a book about farmhouses reframed or redone with today's aesthetics. The house descriptions seem well done with sufficient detail, but unfortunately the houses themselves generally aren't inspiring. They seem to have a bit too much going on for the current simplicity aesthetic. I'm not even talking uber-modernism, just simple and natural materials is what I was hoping for. Maybe this isn't what farmhouses are about though. We did like the little red barn house and a few others that couldn't easily be duplicated (based on old stone houses). Many of the other ones were too big, complicated and expensive looking to consider unless you have one of those factory farms and can afford it. By complicated I mean details just for the sake of putting them there (angles in the ceiling or rafters that don't need to be there)."
4,Nice book,"Nice book, pretty pictures. I would have liked a little more info related to the historical perspectives and how to draw from them using modern elements. All in all worth the money..:)"
1,2 minute toy,"I bought this toy for my boys but they did not even get to fling it. As soon as they got it out of the box, and tried to give it a fling, POP! the head flew off. Good idea for a toy, but it didn't work for us."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This toy is cute but incredibly flimsy. My dog is not a big chewer, she mostly likes to carry toys around in her mouth, and this 'flingshot' was coming apart at the seams within five minutes. It definitely will not last long, but what can you expect for just over a dollar? My pup has enjoyed carrying it around and seems to like the (incredibly annoying!) crowing sounds that it makes, so I'm satisfied. If your dog likes to chew, don't waste the dollar!"
2,A chicken with its head cut off,After the first use the slingshot on the chicken popped out of its body. The sound is cool and it is fun to throw. It just fell apart super fast.
4,Chicken,How much fun can kids and animals in the house have. Dogs liked it better thancats though. Fun for all.
4,Great!,"We have a peekapoo and he goes CRAZY over these chickens! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the toy rips fairly easily, even just after mild play."
3,works fine,"works just like it said. Noise included. Flings just fine, it will fly across the room and break everything. yay."
1,"It went 15 feet on first try, and the feet ripped off on the second one.","It went 15 feet on first try, and the feet ripped off on the second one."
3,not bad,"Fast shipping. Quality of construction is so so, but it great for a laugh! My friend thought it was hilarious."
3,what a great way to wake up in the morning.,"Great puppy toy. It is hard to find interactive dog toys that don't involve food. I want my dog to play with things other than my toes, shoes,or furniture. These slingshot toys keep her entertained and they are a great price."
2,"Great fun, not very sturdy","This little fella is absolutely hilarious. Unfortunately he has a soundbox inside so that whenever he goes flying through the air he screams out ""cock-a-doodle-doo"". It's a little annoying after a while. Fortunately within about a week his head popped right off- I say fortunately because it was easy to fix him and his noisemaker stayed broken."
3,HEAD POPPED OFF!,Head popped off!!After using it 3-times it ripped I left ok feedback but mentioned it ripped a week later I received a phone call aking me to retract my feedback and they apologized & would send out a replacemet hopefully the 2nd one will last much longer.It was nice to see them try to fix the problem ...
2,Good but not durable,The toy was fun while it lasted. Unfortunately it broke pretty quick. However it was a great stocking stuffer. It was the head that detached from the rubber band.
4,Dogs love it! LOL,I bought this as a gag gift for my boyfriend but my dog loved it much more than the boyfriend. it makes the chicken sound very loudly and it flings quite far. I have a shih tzu so he is pretty nice with his toys so I am going to get him one. his reaction was priceless!
2,broke,Toy lasted 2 shots before rubber band came loose on one end. Tied back and head came off next shot. Had a lot of fun throwing chicken without head
1,Disappointing.,I received both the monkey and the chicken for Christmas.The monkey is fine. Built nice and will last.This is not built well at all. There is a cloth loop that connects the head to the rubber tube.It tore on my second launch and I was not even pulling it that hard. The stitching is terrible. Even the other side of the loop was coming off.It's fine to throw but do not try to sling shot it.
3,Wonderful cockadoodle scream sound,"While the chicken has an absolutely glorious scream sound that will delight you it is pretty much worthless as a slingshot. The tubing is way too strong for the flimsy neck pocket you put your finger in to 'shoot' it. I contacted the company, told them what needed changing, and they sent me a new one, but it was not useful as a slingshot either.The chicken is appropriately goofy looking and will make you laugh. We had a lot of fun with this item. I recommend just pulling the neck and throwing it."
1,Not worth your money,"I ordered the flying chickenand the flying monkey, the chicken got here before the monkey and I thought I was going to get to slingshot the chicken but as soon as I pulled back teh chickens head came. This is the worst toy I have ever bought."
5,"For however long it lasts, it's cheap entertainment","I bought several of these slingshot toys and took them to work. The Chicken never made a sound and I busted my fingernail back to the nubbin the first time I tried shooting it. OUCH! I got a band-aide and went back to trying to get some sound out of it. Eventually I took the sound box out of it to investigate if it needed batteries or what. It had a disconnected wire. It is very cheaply made. Its a wonder any of them work. I tried saudering/welding the wire onto a connector and got it to make sound, then stitched the animal back up and put him back in the ring. The best one of these is the monkey with the cape. He is the sturdiest. They are a hoot, especially if you get all of them and have them all going at once. Sounds like a barnyard. Great way to torture your coworkers in the neighboring cubicles! Especially on April Fools day when shenanigans are in season."
3,Chicken toy,Did not come packaged very nicely. Just tossed in a box. Seemed like it might have been used. Do not think it will last very long - if used by young children to toss around. Made funny and loud sounds and did fly far though.
1,DONT BELIEVE THE PHOTO!!,"There is NO WAY an adult could get two or three fingers under the chin of this chicken. In the photo it looks like head of chicken is as big as your fist. It is actually very small and even my 8 year old can only BARELY fit one finger under the beak to try to hold it for launch. Also in ad sounds like it will make sound effect while flying but it actually BAWKS three times after it hits the ground. It is a silly item and I bought it expecting a silly item, but it is so much LESS than ad and photo make it out to be."
4,Awesomely Awsome!,I sent this to my fiancee that's deployed in Iraq as part of his goofy Vantines Day box. THEY LOVED IT! This thing has been passed around to a few different shops along the air field and has not failed to make everyone smile! It's held up pretty good to the beating it's been taking too. I tried it a few times before I mailed it the chicken noises are loud and clear and it shoots pretty far!
3,Chicken Control,"For the price, it was great! I actually sent one to each of my nephews and they had a great time with them. My dog got hold of the one I kept and destroyed it, but they were great fun."
2,fun... while it lasted!,"The bands stretched out the first day he had it, and although it was funny (while it worked) its' price per use was high."
1,Dont waste your money...,Was super excited to see how cheap and fun the product looked online but when i recieved it it broke after we used it twice..
2,The sound wouldn't come on,It is too hard to use even for adults! When you shoot it and crashes into something the sound didn't come of. The quality is poor after a few shots the head was falling apart.
2,Item broke quickly.,"Got this for my father in law. It came apart after 2 days, maybe 20 uses max. For the $3 we spent on it we rigged it up. The novelty outlasted the product unfortunately."
2,MOMENTS of fun!!!,"I purchased this toy as a stocking stuffer. It was used once, and then it was never heard from again..."
1,Disapointed Chicken,I was so excited to get this having boys and all but the head fell off first time we tried it. I was so sad big waste of my money.
3,broke after three slings,This is a fun funny toy but ours broke on like the third fling. When we got ours though the head was on backwards so it might have been a reject from the begining.
3,"Beware for the super strong, band can break but a good product if you know what your doing!","I got this for a friend at Christmas. You put your finger under the chickens beak pull back on the legs and fling through the air. Makes chicken sounds in the air and when it lands. Pretty funny but beware of those never using these before or people who don't know their own strength. It was only good for that day. One of the kids broke this by stretching too much and the band snapped. He was able to use it a few times beforehand but after it broke its useless unless you smack it up against the table to hear the chicken noises. If your unsure how to use one, don't try it. If used properly you will have fun but if you stretch it back too far the band is going to break. I'm only buying another as he knew how to use it and the price is low. But you get what you pay for and maybe if the band was stronger, it would be worthy of 5 stars. Good product but keep it away from those who can't use it properly."
1,Terrible Toy. Didnt last 10 minutes.,"I purchased 4 of these different slingshot toys, and they all tore and fell apart within 30 minutes of use on all of them. Even though these are low cost items, DONT waste your money!"
2,KFC - Kouldn't Fix Chicken,Right out of the box this was a disappointment. The chicken would not go more than 10 feet without risk of breaking the rubberband. It only made a sound after I got fed up with it and threw it on the ground... then it wouldn't make the sound again.
1,Didn't work.,Several people wrote in to warn that it didn't work for them but I bought it anyway. Guess what? It didn't work for me either.Stay away. The flying monkey is much better.
1,"Good concept, extremely poor quality","Recieved my order fairly quick. First try using it, the chicken went about 6 feet. Second try, the rubber tubing pulled loose from the head.Proceeded to throw the pieces in the garbage. Very poor quality. Didn't pursue and exchange due to return shipping cost vs. cost of toy. Future buyers beware."
1,Slingshot Flying Chicken,This was basically a waste of time. They don't make ANY noise and when I received them they had tears in the seams. I couldn't even give them to the kids I had bought them for. Don't purchase. Seller wouldn't even respond to my emails.
1,not worth it,i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my son and it broke almost as soon as it came out of the stocking. to sling it you have to pull back the head (which came off) and it did not go anyhwere. more than a $7.00 shipping fee is what i paid and it was not at all worth it. it wasnt worth the 3.00 cost!
4,Slingshot Flying Chicken w/scream,Lots of fun for the under 10 crowd at our family Christmas and some unexpected fun for the 80 year old!
3,This one's fun,"The flying chicken is a good one. Careful with the stitching. Great fun, and a funny form through the air."
4,Flying chicken,Bought this toy for a friend who's into chickens because he loves to play chickenfoot. This toy is hilarious and entertaining.
3,Great gag gift,I purchased this as a gag gift for a friend in my office. It's a great toy but the design could be improved. The finger holes are not large and the seam comes apart extremely easy. Would be much better if they gave a bit more room in the finger holes.
3,Not for children,"Well- this is clearly not for children. It is hard to pull for little ones and could hurt who it hits. ( I don't know how I ended up ordering this because I only looked at it online and when I placed a future order, I also received these."
3,Flying chicken,"Again, I bought these for my dogs. His head actually came off pretty easily so I don't think its as durable as the monkey. But the boys loved him as well. Can be annoying if you've ever had roosters."
5,Great begginers book!,"I know nothing about playing guitar, and with this book and DVD that came with it, I'm catching on. You don't learn any chords with this book, so I suggest getting progressive guitar chords to go with it."
4,Lenox napki s,Loved the price. The color was a deeper color than the tablecloth of the same pattern that I had previously purchased but not by much.
2,Shoddy workmanship,"Bought this lamp over a year ago, and although it serves it's purpose well, I would not buy this lamp again.First, the lamp switch constantly jams, such that it takes me forever to turn the lamp on/off. It seems that switch thread was a cheap piece with no threads, so the switch just turns around and around.Also, the lamp head cannot stand up on its own-- the bolts to tighten it do not go far enough to keep it in place, so the head just droops. I at one point super-glued the hinge to keep it in place, but it's pretty ridiculous.If you are in the market for a piano lamp, look elsewhere before coming back to this one. It is simply not worth the price."
1,Aladdin Gives This Lamp Thumbs Down,"I am a piano teacher. This lamp seemed like a good value ($49) so I bought it for my second piano and used it very rarely. Nonetheless, about two months after buying it, I noticed that no matter how tightly I turned one of its screws, it would fall to its lowest position. I regret having bought it and suggest that you look elsewhere and perhaps pay a little more."
3,Piano lamp,It is an attractive lamp but the shade gets very hot. I have to be careful turning it off or I burn my hand.
2,orange glowsticks,"not very bright, 25% of them didn't work. would not buy these again.the blue ones were great though! !"
3,the best hits from the disco era,I don't have anything specific to say.I'd like you to make thesesamples be heard.
2,Random sampling of nature pictures/vocabulary,"According to the Parent's Guide, these cards can be grouped into earth, water and sky. It is marketed for ages 9 months and up, and it seems some of the concepts would be difficult for a child that young to grasp, e.g. wetlands, wave, and comet. Also, I am not sure how you could explain to a very small child the difference between the ""water"" card and the ""ocean"" card (and possibly the ""sand"" card and ""beach"" card which is an aerial view).The card for ""sun"" does not look like the sun a child would be familiar with in the sky and may be confused with the ""sunset"" card. Also, you will have to make the distinction between ""sky"" and ""clouds,"" as well as ""earth"" and ""planet.""The remaining cards are rocks, rainbow, moon, stars, sea jellies, fish, soil, flower, mountain, coral, sea star, crab, shell, grass, tree, and leaf."
2,"Error on ""Stars"" card","One of the cards is titled ""Stars"" but it is an image from Hubble's Ultra-Deep-Field survey. I recognize the image which is very famous and it contains nearly no stars--almost all 3000 objects in the original image are galaxies (the Baby einstein card shows a slice of the original image). So it is mislabeled. Babies hate that kind of inaccuracy."
2,Most of them are puppets,Dissapointed!!!Images are not the best ones for kids... I expected some animals and some toys...The quality of the cards itself is good
2,an unusual film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Symbiopsychotaxiplasm is an independent mockumentary by William Greaves filmed mostly in Central Park in New York City.It is about a film crew working on scenes for a film. I did not find it to be very interesting and much of it was repetitive. It also had a large amount of profanity also.The set also has a second disk with a sequel to the film. ""Symbiopsychotaxiplasm Take 2 1/2""The special features on disc one are a theatrical trailer and and a documentary ""Discovering William Greaves""Disc two contains the sequel and an interview with Steve Buscemi"
2,disappointed of the choice of cars,"yes there are many cars but unfortunately the ones that we have gotten are not the known ones that you recognize from the movie. Next to Lightning McQueen and the Hornet, the rest of the cars my kids did not recognize :( Actually we even received several cars double which does not make any sense to me and made my kids very unhappy. This buy was a waste of money for me."
5,Great Product!,"I purchased these cars for my grandson's 8th birthday. He really likes the matchbox-type cars and also has seen the ""Cars"" Movie. This gift couldn't have been more perfect for him. He says it is the best present he received, and none of the cars were duplicates!"
4,Great for Cars Lovers!,"The only reason I gave this particular selection a 4 star rating (vice 5) is because a few of the cars were duplicates. I can give them out as birthday presents to my son's friends, but I wish that all the cars were different. Besides that, the actual cars are very well made and even withstand the forces of drool and new teeth of my 11 month old. I think the cars were made in China - I just hope the paint doesn't contain lead?!?!?"
5,Way better than you're expecting & very important music,this cd is so way better than i was expecting. this is one of their best records. it's not just dubs and loops n stuff. it's a real record and plays like an albumn. their are lyrics and everything. sounds like nothing else they've ever done. if i were being shipped off to an island and could only take ten albumns this one might just have to come along. brilliant!
2,"Interesting, but not essential experimental album from xtc","Not all experiments have good results. This album, while interesting, isn't a very compelling addition to the XTC canon. Really, for all intends and purposes, this is an Andy solo album reworking some key XTC tracks from various albums.As such, it probably should have been released on cd as an Andy Partridge side project(akin to the Lennon/Ono TWO VIRGINS and Harrison's ELECTRONIC SOUNDS lps/Cds). Has some interesting moments."
3,macxtc's review,"If you love ""Drums and Wires"" and the album ""GO2"" you'll love this album... It is like watching the development of a the studio version of these Albums, a lot of fun hearing the songs you have come to love, evolve from expirement to finished product... again, you MUST own ""Drums & Wires"" and/or ""GO2"" for you to fully appreciate ""Explode Together"""
2,Difficult Listening,"For XTC completists only. Some of the electronic experiments here are quite amusing to listen to, such as ""A Dictionary of Modern Mariage"" or ""The Forgotten Language of Light"" (strange titles these) but many of the other samples border on the unlistenable i.e. ""New Broom"" or ""The Rotary"".This album was more fun for Mr Partridge to make than for us to listen to. If you're new to XTC, here's where you should begin:If you're under 25, start with ""Drums and Wires.""If you're between 25 to 35, start with ""Black Sea.""If you're older than 35, start with ""Skylarking.""Enjoy..."
1,For collectors only,A rather unrewarding set of experiments. It would be a pity if this was your introduction to XTC.
4,What a steal!,"Talk about good deals! When I saw this coat I snatched it up without a second thought and have no regrets. The fur is thick and well anchored and the cashmere/wool blend is truly luxurious. The only thing was the size 8 I bought was really big and I had to have it taken in quite about. Even so, I'm very happy with this purchase."
1,Junk,I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money on this. All I wanted it for was to clean the film off the windshield. Didn't work.
1,Glass Wizard glass cleaner=junk,It smudges windows and doesn't get them clean.It's a piece of junk that we threw away.
3,So so...,This item works well for the most part. If you don't keep up on cleaning the cleaning pads (and I thought I did pretty well washing them inbetween uses) you will have dirty triangle shaped outlines where you stop wiping. No big deal to me as I make sure my last stroke in near where I can reach easily with another rag but then again if it did it's job properly I wouldn't need another rag. Oh well. :-/
2,Disappointing results,"We had previously tried a friend's and liked the results and had no trouble. The first time we used ours, the handle broke. We can still use it with a shortened handle. Plus, we weren't pleased with the cleaning results. We tried water alone and a water/vinegar solution. The latter seemed to work better."
3,a bit bowed,"If you look at the photo, notice the handle contact points are in the center. This allows the surface to bow, so you get skips in the center unless you press pretty hard. I use it on an extension pole, so it is hard to press it hard enough to make flat contact with the window. It was pretty bowed on arrival and I considered sending it back, but I am making it work. This product really helps me with some very high windows, so I am keeping it. (It's a pain to drag out the ladder.) If the design was tweaked, this product would be awesome."
1,2001: A Bowel Odyssey,"One of the worst SF books I have ever read. The author displays the mentality of a 14 year old in constructing his future - the entire western world is collapsing because of lack of interest in the manned space program. Okay. Then we have to somehow believe in his cobbled-together scheme of flying a space shuttle to Titan (gee, the astronauts go crazy!! Who would have thought??) The last part of the book is pretty much the same as ""Into Thin Air"" as the explorers go on a pointless slog through Titan slush to find... something to do with chemistry. The descriptions of every bowel movement and pus-filled blister are given more detail than any of the scenes on Titan or the space voayge.Oh yeah, and in keeping with the adolescent spirit there are also two lesbian astronauts. By the time Baxter introduces them you can almost hear the porn-movie soundtrack in the background...Amazon.com needs an ""no-stars"" option. This book certainly deserves it."
3,"Great genesis, disjointed and ""fairytale"" ending","A great beginning with emphasis on combining history, science, and a plausible near future. However there are too many elements that appear disjointed, particularly the Chinese involvement with the asteroid, and the out of control conservative religious right changes in the USA. This could all be acceptable in such a work of fiction, except that the hastliy ""crayoned"" ending is unnecessary. A more realistic ending might have presented a glimpse of evolving life on Titan."
2,A horrible book,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. The mood was well developed but too pessimistic and the politics were exaggerated but chillingly close to some people's rhetoric. The characters were undeveloped and unlikeable. The ending was more interesting than the body of the book but seemed unfinished. Most of all I hated the book's infectious pessimism, fatalism, and grotesqueness."
3,Do we really have fifteen years left ?!?,"As usual, Stephen Baxter presents us with some challenging questions but his bleak pessimism and lack of humour is enough to make you long for the quirky wit of a Miles Vorkosigian adventure. While the voyage to Titan was grim and at times awe inspiring, watching the Earth lapse into a doomed dystopia was nothing short of depressing."
1,Made me want to shoot myself,"Possibly one of the most dreary, depressing, and negative books I have ever read. By the last fourth of the book, nearly everything that could go wrong has, in fact, gone wrong, and I found myself wishing the main characters would go ahead and die. A short Spielberg-meets-Kubrick in AI resurrection at the end fails to forgive the otherwise bleak conclusion. Worth a read, I suppose, if you are in the mood to wallow in pity."
1,Kept thinking it would get better.,"A co-worker lent me this book years ago. To this day, it is singularly unique in that it is the most depressing science fiction book I have ever read. It was good writing, but the plot was a downer...even the ending where Baxter tried to save the characters was lame. What is the worst thing you could do? Save yourself the pain of reading this book and do anything else. It would be better for you."
2,Proof read???,"I am amazed at how bad the spelling is in this book. There is not one page where I haven't seen a spelling error. Shuttle is not spelled Shutde. I worked for the shuttle program for 8 years. It is sad that it is being retired, but it is good to see some vision out there. I wish our county's leaders had some vision."
4,Kinda of like Stephen King: great book except the end.,"I picked up this book without reading any other titles of his and totally enjoyed the book. He had a great amount of detail and the science was completely enjoying. He handled alot of the aspects of traveling in outerspace for a very prolonged period of time, very well which enthralling. Except that I found the end less the compelling, yet it wasn't the easiest story to wrap up. All in all I completely recommend this book and also his Voyage title."
2,An Obvious Rush to Publish Job,"This is the first and only book I've read by this author. This book had so much promise but Baxter ruined it with poor character development and a hasty plot. Did anybody really care about Paula?The beginning third of the book was excellent. Great commentary on the socio-political landscape that we live in. Baxter pushed the politics of today to its extreme but logic conclusion. But then it seemed that Baxter started rushing - was he on a tight deadline? The pace went so fast that I was wondering ""how did we get here?""The only reason that I give this book 2 stars, is the imagination that the author has. The ending was bizarre but imaginative. This book is such as obvious sloppy rush job, I don't how anyone can rate it above 3 stars let alone the highest rating of 5 stars. A 5 star rating is a classic such as Dune, not this hastily written book.Next time Baxter needs to spend more time on writing his books. I hate to see such talent go to waste."
2,"Didn't like the characters, plot absurd, worthwhile science","Baxter works out the science. You have to give him that. But I don't think I would want to spend an hour with any of the characters. Add death, desperation and decay, and you don't have a fun read. A five page science article would have been fine. If you like the ""great ending,"" and the way he works out the science, try Hal Clement. All the pluses, none of the minuses."
2,Disappointment?,"After reading Voyager I was eagerly awaiting the Titan paperback, boy was I disappointed. The beginning was good, with the Columbia Shuttle crash, the middle: boring and fragmented detail. And what was that ending all about? brought back to life? billions of years into the future?I like Baxter's writing style and was a big fan of Voyager but this was way short of the expectations I had set for this book. Maybe I'm being too critical but I had expected so much more from this book."
2,"If you liked Chem 101, you'll love this book","If you liked Chem 101 in college, and want it reborn as fiction, you'll love this book. Otherwise ...I avoided Chem 101, and this is the first Stephen Baxter book I read, so that gives you some background. Development of characters is horribly thin. Even the main character is more of a narrator than a personality. Physics and chemistry, though, are explained to the point of monotony. Bodily functions in zero-gravity or on an alien planet get more than their due, also. To his credit, Baxter takes the plot to a bold conclusion and then one step beyond, which surprised and pleased me. Unfortunately, the reincarnation segue to get past the apparent ending will disappoint even his most avid fans with its pure illogic. Novel ending; if only he could have gotten there reasonably..."
2,"Good texture, dismal tone","The texture, that is the feel of the experiences described in this book, as well as the powerful sweep of events stayed with me. A strong effect. The plot and character relationships and attitude about human fate is depressing and unrealistic. Kind of like Ayn Rand--there are a few sacred, fine people and the rest of humanity is to hell in a handbasket. Not..."
2,What a disappointment!,"After ""The Time Ships"" and ""Ring,"" I couldn't wait to read ""Titan."" And Stephen Baxter's new book sure gets off to a great start. I turned 50 this year and his treatment of the decline of general interest in the great adventure of space exploration struck a very responsive note. But what happened at the end of the book? It seems as if what should be a sequel has been compressed into a vague, hastily written last chapter. Please, Mr. Baxter, after the exhilarating, wondrous yarn that you weave until the death of the last character, why did you let us down? Your ""resurrection"" scenario had me saying, ""Huh?"" How does it happen? Where's the speculative science? How are they going to build that log cabin without a Home Depot nearby? In addition to the Truth, there has to be better writing out there to do justice to such a great story line. Shucks, what a letdown!"
3,"A Dark, Depressing Future","I couldn't quite figure out what was bothering me about this book after enjoying his other works, then I realized it was that the future described here was really dark and depressing. Especially considering it is the near future. Personally I like the details that go into his books about the shuttle and such and was not disappointed here. But while Baxter seems to be knowledgeable concerning the space program its clear he isn't as familiar with the military when writing about it. Also to believe that in 10 years or less we would launch a mission to Titan and the world comes to an end is streching it a little. And the last part of the book is really more fiction than science. I suppose it is an okay read, kind I would recommend when I can't find anything better."
5,The best science-fiction novel I have ever read,"Some of your readers found this book extremely dull. Hmmmm... I read it in virtually one sitting and then lent it to a friend who did likewise.Titan is a harrowing read at times, there's no doubt about it. The desperate lonely struggle for survival of the marooned astronauts against the background of social collapse on a dystopic earth makes for grim but powerful reading.I was close to tears in the last 100 pages but then comes an incredibly uplifting ending. Baxter presents us with the unthinkable then takes us beyond it.I thoroughly recommend this wonderful, thought-provoking and deeply moving book."
4,"A triumph of scientific detail, but culturally incongruous","The most gripping read I have had in quite a while came from the pages detailing the wreck of the Columbia in this book that kickstarts the whole plotline. Fascinating in its level of detail, but frankly offputting in its overly negative view of the future of earth, and quite absurd in its oxymoronic lumping together of Roman Catholic Church, Islamic and Protestant Fundamentalism. The level of depth of understanding of the cultural differences between these differing world views that would utterly deny the revival of St Thomas Summa in an America dominated by Fundamentalist Bible Christians wouldn't come up to the gumbo level on Benaceraff's heel... Otherwise bold in vision and scope."
3,A somewhat tedious road--to a fantastic finish!,"Baxter's talent shines best when he manages to capture on paper the unfathomable possibilities of the extremely distant future. In that he succeeds here as well. However, the first 70% of the book is sometimes agonizingly contrived to allow him to do just that."
4,"Good 1st half, excellent 2nd half","Good 1st half, excellent 2nd half. I now feel like I've actually been to Titan."
4,A good read - with the exception of the ending...,"Titan was as spellbinding as any of Baxter's fact based books. Those who get ""offended"" by the minute descriptions of what a body has to go through in space flight should send the book back, just as the ones who have no understanding of the reality and limitations space flight presents to humankind within our lifetime. Especially those readers who prefer high-flying inventions and technologies which really make no sense should not even pick up this book - go and read a science fiction/fantasy book instead. However, if you are into NASA and know a little about the space probes and other programs launched within the last decades, you will enjoy this book. The only draw back is the ending - I did not like the sudden ""jump"" of a billion years and other ""magical"" happenings (I won't spoil it for you by giving details). Yes, I know, it is to signify hope for humankind but it does not match the style nor the reality driven character of the rest of the book."
4,Deeply moving book!,"I have slowly become a fan of Baxter's books, but must warn the unfamiliar that he can be downright depressing! This book is a good example of that. Never have I felt so in touch with the isolation and blackness of long-term space voyages. I have now concluded that chemical propulsion techniques for exploring the planets are simply no good. We need something like VASIMR or possibly nuclear engines for this to happen responsibly. But read this - it will bring the solar system alive for you!"
4,Stephen Baxter's Titan - An amazing story,"Not for the faint-hearted or the non-technically-oriented, this is a highly technical, prescient and terrifying believable speculative tale of the failures of the NASA space program and of human civilization but with a positive, amazing central plot of a seemingly doomed and desperate human mission to Saturn's enigmatic moon, Titan. The human characters are numerous and various with the central personalities quite well-drawn and sympathetic. If you ever wanted to know how to survive on a long space voyage and then on the surface of a frigid, hostile world, this is the book. Highly recommended for space buffs, Stephen Baxter does a wonderful job of story-telling with enough technical details to make the settings and events painfully believable."
1,Amazingly bad,"The first part of the book was a very boring description of bureaucracy and what parts to use to build the spaceship. I thought they'd never actually get into space! Then they did, and it got horribly worse. Characters seem to be there just to describe the physical misery of the trip, and there was no other reason to care about them. I agree that there is merit in describing this ""accurate"" misery, but it makes for an awful read. One of the worst books I've read."
2,"Fast out of the gate, breaks leg in the stretch","""Titan"" is one of those rare books which rivets your attention through the first 100 pages, loses steam, and ultimately disapppoints. One cannot fault the author's bleak predictions for the future of the space program and NASA, most of which is unfortunately proving to be factually accurate, but there is absolutely nothing inspirational or uplifting about the book at all, even though the last astronauts survive a six year trip to Titan in believable fashion! No character is developed beyond the most negative aspect of his or her personality, and the hyperspace jump from sound scientific and technical discussion into utter fantasy (when, in the space of about ten pages,two of the characters are resurrected billions of years after they die on Titan---whoa!)provides only a jarring discord and fatally injures the credibility of the book. Baxter had the makings of a very good book, some wonderful concepts, but failed to deliver. I want a refund."
5,Shoe Order,This is my second order of the same shoe as I am very pleased with the first order. I got it quickly too.
5,Coromega 3,Coromega Omega-3 Supplement is a great way to get those needed fish oils! We love all the flavors but the one with chocolate is our favorite. The small packages are so easy to take on the go! Best of all: the kids love it!!!
2,Acceptable but not fabulous,These are much better than taking regular fish oil capsules but the regular Coromega with Orange flavoring is MUCH better. I love chocolate but this flavor does not work well. I do not burp and have horrible fish taste in my mouth with them like most fish oil but the regular orange flavor is what I will be buying next time.
1,"WIth a ""Hint"" of chocolate","I have been using Coromega Omega-3 supplement for several months with good results. But, I recently ordered the supplement with a ""hint"" of chocolate since I am a die-hard chocolate lover. What a mistake! The hint of chocolate is the worse combination with the orange flavor and I almost gag with each dose. I am trying to decide if I should throw out the box or just suffer through the next 80 packets."
2,Not the best taste ever,"The Coromega with chocolate was hated by all three in my family. As much as I love chocolate and orange together they just don't work well here. We gave them all to a friend, who also didn't like them and gave them to another friend....If you want great taste and great benefit to your body, stick with the orange flavor Coromega. It tastes great every time..... Megan"
5,unbelievably good!!,"I take these cause omega 3 oils help you sleep, and it lowers cholesterol. It's so delicious to."
1,Enlightening Read,"This is the second Carolina book I have read, which my wife recently loaned me. It's all she talks about lately. Anyway, any guy who might find himself falling under a beautiful woman's magic spell, this book can be useful. Then, again, who cares if you're in love. What I want to know is when is Carolina going to fall for some guy herself, and will she use magic to get a date? Dona Carolina, her ancestral guardian, is the comic relief, but I enjoyed getting to know her family. Funny moments throughout."
5,shockingly terrific,I am using them for my camera strobe flash which uses batteries up fast. The batteries cycle fast and last much longer than other's I have used.
5,Long lasting batteries,These are only supposed to last a few weeks but I have been using one for nearly two months. I suppose it depends on how often and how long they are used. I rarely need to charge it.
2,Loses charge quickly,"I'm a professional photographer, and I bought these batteries to use in my flashes at weddings. They recycle quickly, but I went through three sets of four batteries at one wedding. If I use eneloop, one set will last the whole day. Even my rechargeable energizer batteries last longer than these. What a waste of money. I would love to return these, but 17th Street Photo doesn't accept returns on batteries. I guess I'll just chalk it up to a lesson learned. Stick with eneloop."
1,Maha Powerex 2700 doesn't hold the charge,"I have 8 Maha Powerex AA 2700 MH NiMH batteries.None of them stays charged for more than one day, droping quickly to 0.8 V.They are useless even for the less demanding of the applications.I have 6 different battery charger, 4 clever ones and 2 old ones with very low current (0.2 to 0.1 A).I have the same problem with all chargers, therefore the problem is not due to the chargers.I will not recommend these batteries as they are probably the worse ones that I ever had (even worse than the cheap ones sold by hard discounters)"
1,Complete disappointment,"I own the C9000 charger and a quite a few sets of AA and AAA Powerex and Imedion over the last 4 years, which I roll on a regular basis.MAHA boasts a minimum 500 recharges, but they rarely charge more than 15 times before dying. The last disappointment was a set of 4 Powerex AAA 1000 mAh one year old: 2 of them died after 3 charges and none of those 4 batteries ever reached more than 800 mAH. This is the second fault of MAHA batteries: they typically reach at most somewhere between 60 and 80% of their declared capacity after only the first 4 or 5 charges.After 4 years of using MAHA batteries and chargers, I'm soooo disapointed that I'll switch to Duracell. I still have a set of 4 AA Duracell batteries 1700 mAH that still charges to 1500 mAH after 6 years. None of the MAHA batteries reached that performance!"
2,"Powerex AA 2700mAh - Poor performance, sub-par","I've had these batteries for a few days and have used them three times (and re-charged three times using a La Crosse BC-1000 charger). All four batteries do not fully charge (as do other manufacturer's batteries) and last about 80% as long as the Eneloop batteries I had that are 2,100 mAh. I even fully dis-charged the batteries and re-charged them slowly over a 20 hr period and the batteries still wouldn't fully charge.Bottom line: It's not the cost that is my concern but the PERFORMANCE. These are sub-par batteries and I can't recommend them. Two stars because I'll still use them but only as a last resort."
1,Confused and angry,Got my order Friday but when I looked at the package there was a huge whole in the side and everything is missing! I'm not sure what to do but I still need the batteries!
5,"Great, consistent service","Vendor is excellent--highly recommend; replaces a set of these I bought about three years ago; they weren't dead but thought would start fresh for some new equipment. If you have time to top off before use, these are great. Using in wireless lavalier mics. Maybe 1/2 the juice of alkalines, but still plenty for what I'm doing."
4,Rock solid battery's,"Wish I knew about these battery's sooner. I will never buy a regular alkaline battery again. The powerex are far better than the recharageable Energizer, or Duracell."
1,Not compatible with the Launch Box,Very disappointed with these batteries. Did not work with the Launch Box or its Charger. Would not reccommend this product for that use.
4,Powerex 2700mAh AA Battery,"I buy 2 sets of 2700mAh Powerex for my new Canon S5IS camera. Before I have used 2 set of 2500mAh Energize and I was able to made 500 photos with flash or without. At the same condition, with Powerex 2700mAh I have realy shock to see that I finish the second 2GB SDcard. Total, 1300 photos plus 10 min of movie. Also the flash increase the charging speed considerabil.Great product. With o slow charge (200mAh) the battery stop around 2650 and 2710 mAh capacity."
5,Powerex Batteries,These batteries are very powerful and work excellent on my magic flight launch box portable vaporizer. I ordered them and received them about 3 days later. I am pleased with my purchase and would do business with these folks again.
4,Good but........,"Bought these for the MFLB. They work good,a bit better than stock batts.The problem is the MFLB is hard on batteries & I have a feeling if I don""t get the MFLB Power Adapter(variable voltage for complete control) I will be buying many more batteries.They do work well it's just for how long.After a few weeks of use it seems that I couldn't get many ""hits"" before they were dead.These batteries would be much better charging on a good charger,one that will recondition them.For the price of that I will get the PA insted!!!$15 for Batteries $40 for a good charger.....The PA is $59!!!Much easier for at home use...has a car adapter if you just have to do it while driving(not recommended LOL)!!!Joe"
2,Batteries work but not for the item advertised!,"I bought 2 Pkgs. of these super duper AA rechargeable batteries that were advertised as an accessory to the Magic Flight vaporizer. They were supposed to hold a much longer charge than the ones that come with it.THEY DON'T FIT!!! They are fat. I can only get them into my camera & a few other items, and it's a tight squeeze."
4,good product,just purchased the new batteries for my digital camera and they really seem to hold a good charge.good product i would recommend these powerex batteries to anyone who uses AA or AAA batteries in their digital cameras.the key to battery life is a good charger not always the fastest but to the fullest charge.
5,Very Good Batteries,Most people want good rechargeable batteries for their application but often don't see the connection between the battery and the charger . These batteries have not failed me in my flash . Its not used every day but every so often I put them in a proper charger that protects their health . I would like to get some more of these.
3,Inflated specs,"I ordered a dozen, then immediately refreshed them to bring them up to maximum capacity. A Lacross BC-900 was used for the task. It takes about a week of constant charge/discharge cycles to complete a set of 4. The batteries maximum capacity was in the range of 2450 to 2590 mAh, with an overall average of 2530. This is somewhat short of the advertised 2700 mAh.My prior purchase of NiMH AAs were Duracells listed at 2650 mAH. The actual capacity of these turned out to be in the 2600 mAH range. This was a few years ago and most will no longer recharge or don't hold a charge for very long.I complained to Maha about it and the rep actually drew a dozen out of stock and proceded to refresh them on the Maha charger. It turned out that he got the same results as I did.The good news is that he sent me the dozen he tested free of charge. Good customer service, but I hardly need that many batteries. I imagine that after a few years they will all need to be replaced."
5,Great batteries for digital camera,"Wanted batteries that would last for our new Canon PowerShot SX 130 IS. Taken quite a few pictures with it, a lot with flash, and haven;t had to charge them yet. Highly recommend the batteries!"
5,The best NiMH cells I've found,"These have a similar charge rate and lifespan to big-name products (Energizer, Duracell, etc), but they have a higher capacity than most (2700mAh as opposed to ~2200mAh). I am very satisfied with my purchase."
3,Good but 50% success rate right now,"Bought these plus the Powerex charger last March 2007 and it is now December 2007. After 2 months, 2 pieces displayed rust on the + and - ends of the batteries...the other two are ok. They all still work until now though although I've noticed that the rusted ones have less charge. I like them though and I've decided to buy 4 more to test again since I am more or less ok with the product. They are especially good for remote control toys since they last a long time. :)"
1,first batch was great second batch not so great,"The first batch I purchased was awesome, then someone stole my camera bag leaving me only the five I had in my Nikon sb 800. Purchased some more and they will not hold a charge. My first batteries charge upto 1.37 volts then after a few days they drop to 1.32 volts and stay there for months. I noticed that Maha now sells battter that have a slow discharge rate. I wander if they are putting out crappy batteries in order to sell there new slow dicharge batteries. I and going to give the Calumet batteries a shot and hope I have better luck.I am sill using my original 5 Maha batteries they still work great. I only wish the last twenty four I purchased did......."
5,MFLB owners read this!,Great batteries to replace the stock ones and they can charge in the battery charger as well which i found convenient. Noticed a big difference in power and longer battery life. i would reccomend to any mflb owner who wants to get more out of there vaporizer and cant go wrong with price either!
3,MFLB,Do not get for the magic flight launch box. You have to peel the wrapping off for it to even work and then there's a large amount of residual glue along the outside of the batteries.
1,Horrible!!,"I work as a photographer and needed batteries for my strobe, so I ordered these batteries to replace my eneloops 1500mAh that couldn't hold a charge for a day and because of the 2700mAh, figuring they would last me longer. My damaged eneloops outlived these batteries. What more can I say? Eneloop is the better product, PowerEX overpriced dollar store batteries~!"
3,Powerex Batteries,Just recently tried these and found that the capacity fell short of the 2700 Mh rating. After repeated charging and discharging the highest capacity was 2500. I used the MH-C9000 Charger-Analyzer to condition the batteries. The batteries were just purchsed and used once.
2,Disappointing,I had so looked forward to seeing these two legends for the first time. The acting is so stilted and BORING!!!!!!!!!!! Roland Young was the only fun.Chocolate Soldier with Nelson Eddy and Rise Stevens flows beautifully thru the same story plus some wonderful music.
4,They don't nest very well,I like these mixing bowls. They look very nice and are made of beautiful stainless steel. The only problem is the handles are not made to nest inside each other very well. It would have been nice if they were designed to nest perfectly instead of the slightly cockeyed manner in which they sit.
5,Can not love this set more,"Best mixing bowl set I've ever had.Super quality at reasonable price.I also recommended it to several friends who ended up with being very satisfied with it, too."
4,REVIEW SHOWCASES,"THEY WHERE WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT IN ONE OF THEM THE CASE HAD A CRACK THAT MAYBE OCCURRED DURING TRANSPORT, THEY SHOULD BE SHIPPED WITH MORE PROTECTION"
3,Blew an O2 sensor 5 days after installing this.,I'm guessing the O2 sensor must have been borderline health wise and this pushed it over the edge. Not a nice surprise.
1,Piece O' Junk,"I bought this K&N air filter last year and have sinced cleaned it once and used it approximately 40,000 miles. I took it out to clean it for the second time and much to my displeasure found that the filter element was separated from the rubber surround in a few places. This means that unfiltered air was getting into my engine for how long I have no idea. I did email K&N directly a couple of times and they never returned my emails. I would have been happy with getting at least 100,000 miles out of this but for this price it's a piece of junk. To all the K&N fans who will probably question what I'm telling, yes I did get the K&N cleaning kit and yes I did follow the instructions to the ""T"". I bet many more filters out there are failing but people just don't realize it. I will never buy another K&N product again."
4,No need for replacement,"Purchased this product and similar one for both cars, Odyssey and Accord. Liked the fact that we do not have to replace and only need to clean and oil. Didnt notice much performance improvement or increased noise, but I didn't expect to. Have not seen improved mileage either. Would have rated 3 stars since it feels like it works normally, but have a 4 since it does not need to get replaced."
5,Lovely lush sounds,"This is a beautiful album of sophisticated music sung by a sophisticated singer. If you have not heard this yet, but are a fan of Sarah and of Duke Ellington's music, just imagine Sarah singing ""Lush Life""- it's exactly as good as you would expect. Emphasis on ballads here, but with some swinging moments. Sarah is in complete control, and is assisted by great performers such as Zoot Sims and Joe Pass."
4,Good Product,"Price for one months supply was same as larger quantity, which made excellent price-wise. Item is less expensive for larger quantity at chiropractor."
4,GERD Relief,"I have been taking Nexium for a couple of years now. I was taking one Nexium before my evening meal. About a month ago, I began taking two Zypan at my evening meal and at the same time I stopped Nexium. This has taken care of about 95% of my problems with heartburn and reflux. I recommend it."
2,Not for those who are lactose intolerant!,"I purchased this based on other reviews describing how well it works to prevent bloating and gas. I SHOULD have check into it further to find out what is in it since this page doesn't bother to list the ingredients. Lactose is one of the ingredients. If you are like me and are lactose intolerant, this will not prevent bloating and gas but cause more of it. Just be aware....."
5,Recommended by family doctor,"This works for both the wife and I very well, one 3 times a day. Expensive but cheaper than a prescription."
5,zypan excellent,"My Chiropractor/kinesiologist recommended this product. I have been happy using it. I use it for a gluten problem which leaves my face with itchy hives. When i take this tablets, the hives are much less and so is the itchiness. Makes life more bareable."
1,Gave me hemroids,Think the title says it all never had them before or since. Stopped using the product but wasn't sure this product caused it. So tried it one more time and it happened again. Good luck to you if you decide to buy it.
4,great product,"This product works really great for me. I had been taking Prilosec OTC and other stomach medicines in the past. With this product I was able to eliminate taking those. Great stuff, worked for me!"
1,WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS?!?,"The 1980s were a great period in music history. We had Blondie, Madonna, and groups like Tears For Fears and The Police. So to commemorate the 1980s, Madacy released this collection, '20 Best Of 80's Hits.' You get 20 legendary 1980s songs for a cheap price. Sounds great, right?Wrong. These are not just re-recorded versions, these aren't even the ORIGINAL ARTISTS!!!Don't waste your money and your time. Ignore this at all costs. If I could, I'd give this set zero stars.Not recommended."
1,this is not a book by J. Krishnamurti!,"If you're looking for a book by Jiddu Krishnamurti - this is NOT it! don't spend your money - I know people who got cheated by the title and the name, not careful enough to notice the initials. and, besides, it's not a good book"
2,Read this before you buy it!,"This 3 DVD B&W set is done well EXCEPT that it is NOT ""The Rat Pack"" singing! It is Frank, Dean & Sammy singing separately. Sammy sings on one DVD, Dean on another & Frank on the third. I thought it was the Las Vegas act that they did TOGETHER as The Rat Pack but it was not. If the DVD said ""The Beatles Sing"", would you expect 4 DVD's with John, Paul, George & Ringo singing their own selections separately? No! So, if you don't mind Frank, Dean & Sammy singing their music individually, this is a good 3 DVD set. But if you want The Rat Pack as we knew them in their Las Vegas act, this isn't it. Each of them sing about 12-15 songs on each DVD, but the song selections could have been better. Most of the songs in this set were NOT big hits."
3,One + One + One Only Equals Three,"When I think of the Rat Pack, I think of the chemistry that happened between the members that made thier joint collaborations special (in live shows as well as their famous after-hours adventures). As a collective unit together they were greater than the sum of the individual parts.This 3 CD set is a collection of three individual CDs outlining the individual careers of Frank, Dino and Sammy. As the CDs focus on the individual, rather than collaborative careers of these talented individuals it's an interesting collection, but does not represent 3 CDs of collaborative Rat Pack magic.A fine package of vintage footage associated with these three very talented individuals, but - just as a collection of 4 solo albums (one from John, one from George, one from Paul and one from Ringo) would never represent a Beatle album - I'm not sure this package truly represents the real Rat Pack magic."
3,Note Finder,This product is not too sturdy. The note fell off the string after 2 months. The Music Note Teacher is a better product.
4,Great learning aid,Great tool for teaching and reinforcing music reading. Need to find removable sharp and flat stickers to change key though!!
4,Read! And feel Mongol history and Chingis Khan.,"The Secret History of the Mongols is one of the most important primary source for study of Mongol history and Chingis Khan. Also, this book is very impressive poet like Homor's great works. I know Francis Woodman Cleaves has already translated it into English. He is great master of Mongol history, however, his ""King James English"" is terrible, especially foreigners like me. Paul Khan's work overcomes this big problem. The easy and spoken English let everyone enjoy it. Now, read it, enjoy it, and feel the ""World Conqueror"""
2,The Poor Man's Chinggis Khan,"This is one of the least thorough interpretations of The Secret History of the Mongols. Anyone who finds this book of any interest should read the same book translated by Francis Woodman Cleaves or Igor de Rachewiltz, both versions are considerably better."
3,More like a medium grind,"I bought this to refill my Himalayan salt shakers, but it is a noticeably coarser grind. The packaging could have been better as some had spilled and was leaking from the package when delivered."
3,There's Better Vance Than This,"I've loved everything I've read by Jack Vance up to this book. But Emphyrio is not written in the style of some his later stories, although it was by no means poorly written. It just lacks the dry wit that is the hallmark of, for example, the (awesome) Demon Princes and for me that was a major disappointment.Nonetheless, the story was fine. Though, without getting into too much of the plot, it's one of those ""clever"" or ""meaningful"" endings which sci-fi authors all like to do from time to time. If that's your thing, this book is for you. If not, there's better Vance to be read."
4,Be Patient w/The Blacks: A Difficult Read But Worth It!,"Let me start off by saying that Jean Genet's ""The Blacks"" isn't for everyone. It's a very abstract work that demands patience from the reader. It's a play within a play so there are lots of times when you are not sure when the characters are addressing themselves or the audience. That being said Genet originally wrote the play (In French) as an assault against French Colonialism in Africa in the 1950's.....However ""The Blacks"" most famous production came in New York in 1961. Directed by Gene Frankel and starring Roscoe Lee Browne, James Earl Jones, Lou Gossett Jr., Cicely Tyson, and Maya Angelou ""The Blacks"" ushered in a whole new era of black actors in America. This version of the play contains between 10 and 15 pictures of that New York production. The pictures alone are more than worth the price of the book!"
3,good film; enchanting score;pubescent Hepburn,"The Little Minister was one of Katherine Hepburn's earliest works. She was a teenager when this film was made but had already made a name for herself. The story is fairly well done but the compelling aspects of this film are the score, a hauntingly beautiful Irish melody (composed by Max Steiner?) and the exquisitely gorgeous young Hepburn. Hepburn's reputation , even at this early date, preceded her, resulting in an intimidated leading man in John Beal."
1,Drive 10 is sloooow,"Drive 10 is not worth the money. I takes several hours to repair/rebuild a disk with 200k files, which is actually quite common with OSX. The repair was not even done right and the disk did no longer mount.Later I bought DiskWarrior 3.0, it did the same job better on the same disk in around half an hour."
1,A text with too many errors and clumsy explanations.,"This third edition is full of typos and even some errors that, in my opinion, would be devastating to a business student attempting to digest technical material.I wouldn't have minded the tons of typos such as ""a procedures"" for ""a procedure"" and ""port 12"" instead of ""port 2"" and ""ft/s"" instead of ""frames/s,"" but ""increases"" instead of ""decreases"" was too much to take at the end of an explanation of the relationship between bandwidth and signal to noise ratio.My school will not be using this text next semester and my copy will be going in the trash at the end of this term. In my opinion, a third edition in this price range should not have so many errors and clumsily written explanations."
3,Not an Appropriate Introductory Textbook,"A course I took earlier this year used this textbook, and I wasn't too fond of it. The book's explanations were very clinical, and other reviewers are correct in observing that it has many typographical errors (which are very frustrating when trying to solve mathematically inclined equations).The professor deviated substantially from the text, supplying us with several real-world examples and more on the theory behind the examples given in the book. If he had not done that, I do not think I would have been able to learn the material from the book alone. Many of its explanations are too brief and lack depth or supporting examples.If you are teaching an information systems course and intend to use this textbook, be prepared to supplement it with substantial cases or lose the interest and comprehension of your students."
2,Not for beginners,"I was asked to teach a class using this book. Unfortunately, the book is over the heads of most of the students. It is not the best job of presenting the information either. None of the students like the book. I do not recommend it as a class textbook, but as a reference for someone who already is in the data comm field. It does have some good technical information, but is not presented in a way that you can read the book from cover to cover."
3,Highly Technical - not an easy read at all,"For someone that judges a book by its cover, I was more than unplesantly fooled. This book is not an easy read; I would estimate that you need at least a year of technical training to fully comprehend the concepts. Luckily I have that background. However, many of my classmates did not and the text book was too difficult for them. There are many helpful diagrams and figures...but they make absolutely no sense whatsoever (without the technical knowledge)."
4,ok Book,"I had to buy this book for school. It was ok, the professor mostly taught from this book rather than the other one we had."
4,Business Data Communications,This book arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I would purchase fromthis seller again.
3,There are better books out there,"I'm not a big fan of Stalling's writing. This is a text book, I had to use for a networking class. I prefer the networking book by Andrew Tanenbaum (which also happens to be available on the kindle)."
2,Not at all what I expected,"Although this book differed from any notions I may have entertained prior to opening the cover, it is a journey to be undertaken by those who really want to deepen their connection with the mineral kingdom. Much of this information is really about an experience... a journey. The book reads as though it is a single, giant guided meditation, and I feel that it is a lesson in ""beingness"" if nothing more.That alone may be why it is out there for us to enjoy.All of that aside, I erally tried to take the messages to heart. A lot of the material presented just didn't click. It is very New Agey, very ""airy-fairy,"" or the like. It is written as a series of lessons with key phrases intended to appeal to our inner selves, but it just didn't seem to light that spark for me. I don't expect this to become an overnight success or a favoured book in most crystal libraries, but it is still a neat and imaginative view into the mysteries of the crystalline community."
2,Don't be fooled by this pseudo-science,"This book tries to convince readers of its superiority to other titles in the same new-age genre by using complicated terminology. Although some of the visualizations are helpful, the amount of thought behind them is minimal. Beware of terms used such as ""higher"" and ""more pure"". This book perpetuates stereotypes of superior Christianity and denigrates the solid body and earth. There are much better books on the same subject. Avoid this one."
5,Sushi: Taste & Techiques,"Great hard cover book teaching you the basics of different types of sushi. The book advises you on what you will need regarding basic utensils and ingredients, as well as how to use and prep with them. Easy directions and nice pictures. Good book to have on your coffee table for others to view. One of the better books to educate you on the basics of sushi making and sushi protocols. If you are looking for a book w/ sushi variations and/or step by step recipes...this is not the book. At this time I have not found such a book for we beginners but I have found many recipes on line. I also collect take-out sushi menus from my favorite restaurants. This way I can get ideas regarding the different ingredients to make the various sushi combinations I enjoy. I use the book to help make it all come together properly."
5,refreshing,"I agree with the title, It something that you want to listen to over and over again. I have it in my CD changer and there it will stay.Being a middle aged Christian woman it is great to hear something that you can relate to.I pray to God that other will buy and listen to it. It will keep you thinking about how good God is to us.Mr. Rich keep up the good work."
3,KEEP YOUR EYE TO THE SKY,"After reading fellow reviewers' comments, I had high expectations for SyFy's ROADKILL. While I concur with many of these comments, I found some of the movie a little cliché and repetitious. Kudos for the unexpected order of slayings and the Irish scenery.Once again, a group of friends go off on a sightseeing trip and run into a clan of gypsies instead of hillbillies. After stealing a strange medallion from the head klansman (an excellent Ned Dennehy) they accidentally run over the village oracle who puts a curse on them regarding the fabled simuroc--a big bad hungry bird.ROADKILL is one of the better films in the ""Maneater"" series. I admit if I heard ""Dude"" one more time, I might have used the DVD for a frisbee. Most of the performances are adequate, although Stephen Rea is ill-used in a basically cameo appearance. The bird effects are decent with only a couple of minor flaws. Overall, ROADKILL is entertaining; just expected more."
2,ok.but acting a little stale,"boring movie, acting is stale and slow, cgi special effects is blind and basic. only watch once. then never watch again"
2,Speechless...Not in a good way.,Ok this movie is weird. The gore was intense but it looked cheesy. A giant bird picking up people because they weren't protected by a necklace. It was just strange.
3,drinking game,"Well, I gave this one three stars because it's not the worst cheap horror film ever. If you're a college student who's into drinking games, you have a built-in ""drink when they say"" one here. I have never even heard a regular human being say ""dude"" so many times. I estimate the male characters said it between 20-30 times within the first half hour. Dude. C'mon."
2,S and M Fest,"This is exactly the kind of book that gives gay and lesbian people a bad name. Using S&M and bondage as entertainment in this way is not good and not useful. I read all the reviews of this book and thought that with so many gals saying the book was a winner that it had to be, but maybe I will be the one voice of warning. This book is disturbing, and the characters are disturbed, so disturbed that there is no way the ending would be like the author has written it. I could not believe for one minute that someone who liked being beaten within an inch of her live would reform from it in this way. True ""love"" does not heal people the way this book tries to pretend. If you like erotic stories or romance, this is not for you. This one is seriously messed up and psychologically unrealistic. Try some of the other Radclyffe stories if you want something halfway believable."
5,Deep Dark and Sexy,"This was a wonderful read. Inside of all of us there are surely deep, dark, and delicious fantasies. This book was both erotica filled while holding the promise of hope to find true love. I travel a lot and these characters were great company. Thank you for not just filling time but making it enjoyable!"
2,Disappointing,"This book wasn't all bad. It brought an interesting perspective to the subject matter, and made some intriguing points. Overall, however, it was just rather boring, which is not at all what I'm accustomed to from this author. There was a ton of talk, and long stretches of time where the characters didn't progress at all, and when they did it seemed either forced or less than three dimensional. Don't hesitate to check out the author's other books, however.As an aside, I'm hardly experienced, but I've enjoyed much better lesbian S/M fiction from Penumbra's ""Kink"" series on the internet, or alternatively (no pun intended) Michal Salat's and Joann Muscolo's ""Speed of the Beat of My Heart."" These series seem to bring out the pleasure, love and trust side of the life more than the self-torture and pain that seemed to be over-emphasized in this book for my taste."
2,"A good effort, but alas unsuccessful",I tried to listen to this CD several times and I found myself falling asleep. To say that it is boring is an understatement. I don't know if it is the voice or the guitar but I could not keep my eyes open.My only reccomendation is it is great for insomnia.
4,"Not as good as ""Black tiger""","Y&T are rather uneven and the band have released excellent as well as horrible songs. ""In rock we trust"" from 1984 isn't the best Y&T album but it sure have some highlights. The rather fast and melodic ""Don't stop running"" together with the captivating ""Lipstick and leather"" are the best tracks. Songs as ""She's a liar"" and ""Your love is driving me crazy"" are also above average. The opener ""Rock & roll's gonna save the world"" is alright if you're not paying any attention to the lyrics. I have always had a hard time hearing Dave Meniketti singing love ballads, and ""This time"" is not an exception - just boring! If I were asked to give advise, I'd say that you should get ""Black tiger"" and ""Mean streak"" before this one. But the more you listen to ""In rock we trust"", the better it gets. Keep on rocking!"
3,Enjoyable material.,"Until just recently, I hadn't listened to In Rock We Trust for quite some time. I've had this disc for many years, though. I still consider it to be a nice and listenable collection of songs. There's a total of ten tracks, and the musical direction of the album is melodic hard rock. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight and satisfying. The guitar work is good and energetic throughout. Dave Meniketti also does an efficient job with the vocal duties. My favorite songs are ""Life, Life, Life,"" ""I'll Keep on Believin' (Do You Know),"" and ""This Time."" ""I'll Keep on Believin' (Do You Know)"" is a nice and melodic track with a catchy chorus, while ""This Time"" is a good ballad. Most of the songs on In Rock We Trust are straight-ahead rockers. I find all of the tunes to be pretty cool. Y&T is a respectable band. Worth a listen."
4,Great hat,This hat is great! It was the perfect finishing touch for my Carmen Sandiego halloween costume. The hat naturally flopped over my eyes perfectly!
4,Great buy,I love this rack! I would give it 5 stars but the assembly is a little rough. It may have been easier had I attempted putting it together if I had done it on a day I haft worked 14 hours! Other than that it looks great and saves a ton of space! Not to mention it is different from the standard hanging pot rack! Love it!
2,missing essential parts,I ordered this product but a key part was missing. It was very frustrating. I would not buy another product from this company.
3,A little on the narrow side.,"I bought this pot stand to put my stock pots and chili pots onto to free up space. It put together very quickly and seems very sturdy. It looks great. I only have one problem. The bottom shelf holds my 8 qt Le Cruset very well, but the next shelf up is a very tight fit for my taller and narrower Calphalon 8 quart. I have to fit it in just so to keep from scratching it. The rest of the other shelves get progressively narrower, too narrow for any more large pots. I am using it for my Calphalon, not for the larger pots that I wanted it for, and it is still a very tight fit to get the pots into place. I have to take them in and out very carefully in order to not scratch up the sides of my polished pots. Not it does look great, and works perfectly well for these pots, I just wish it were wider so that I could use it for my bigger pots, and you really can't beat the price. I am now looking for a bigger stand.Khandi"
4,Nice Rack!!,"I bought this pot rack as soon as I saw it because I was conviced there was a typo in the price! All the other racks I looked at online and in stores were hundreds of dollars so I had expected this one to be as well. It looks almost exactly like the standing pot rack at Williams-Sonoma but much cheaper.Now that I've received it, I can see that it is made of weighty steel pieces. Mine is graphite powder coat finished and even the screws are perfectly matched.As far as the assembly is concerned my son and his friend (both 10 years old) put it together for me in about an hour and for $20 which I thought was a fabulous bargain.I can see the benefit in strength and aesthetics of 3 solid vertical pieces instead of 6 where they're attached half way up like with this one. Obviously the more expensive stands aren't built like this. But for the money you just can't beat it. Plus it's a great way to show off your Le Creuset and keep cookware out of the way and accessable at the same time."
1,Cheaply made,Hardware is the wrong size!!!! The bolt pops right through the finish nut. The closed finished nut should be deeper to accommodate the length of the bolt.
1,Unstable leaning tower,"The package arrived nicely packaged. I rushed to put it together to display my iron cookware. I followed the instructions carefully, to no avail did the item stabilize. I tried again thinking I had missed something.... NO. It wiggles and leans no matter what I do. The nuts with caps are fake, if you tighten to much the cap pops off. I think the attempt to reduce shipping cost by cutting the uprights in half caused the piece to be less stable. I have chosen to keep it only due to cost, but I contacted my local iron shop and I am having the whole thing welded. The cost will still keep me under the high priced ones that apparently are made well. No wonder in the instructions no less than 4 times does it say to keep away from traffic areas or not to touch it."
3,"Old Dutch 60-inch Cookware Stand, Graphite","Old Dutch 60-Inch Cookware Stand, Graphite.This is a good product for those whom have limited space in kitchen. The assembly was relatively easy (approx. 30 minutes) - somewhat klunky assembly at first, until it free stands. Many phillip screws with captive nut arrangement. This item was inexpensive compared to others available.I'm pleased with the product - My new stainless steel cookware looks good being shelved on this item. Everything is now readily availble. If you have stainless steel, or other higher-end cookware, this is the thing to use."
1,easy to assemble if the holes are engineered properly,"One of the pairs of holes on the middle struts which join the upper and lower parts together is off kilter so those pairs of screws in order for the holes to line up are at angle and rub up against each other instead of being parallel. The other screws are loose so it is not a problem with the lack of flexibility prior to full assembly. The holes are definitely off kilter. I am sending this back to Amazon. Also, the graphite is a powdery paint that came off and I was not rough with these parts at all. Rereading these glowing reviews, I went back to look at my stand and I have assembled plenty of deep discount metal, graphite looking pieces of furniture before and the holes on the stand are definitely off. It's just as well. Despite the cheap price which I love, the design is really not my cup of tea."
3,Good solution,Space saving for pots and pans; looks quite stylish (chrome version) and fits a reeasonable number of cooking pots. Assembly OK but a little finnicky (you keep feeling it would be simpler with three hands!) Overall good value.
3,A good reference,"I bought this book and two other books by Mr. Root because he is well-known as an outstanding bridge player and teacher. I am studying this book along with the Audrey Grant books on bridge. Although this is a good series, I think the Grant books are better. Often the two series don't always agree. But Grant's explanations are clearer that the Root books."
3,"Too many examples, too little explanation","The book covers a great deal of material, but it was a bit disappointing regarding the explanation of certain plays. It is certain very thorough as for examples, it offers a very wide view of possible holdings and explains very well why a cartain play works in that circumstance, but doesn't explain which guidelines to follow to decide when to adopt such a play. The material covered is though very much, and anyone that thinks he/she could derive the rule from the example, would find the book very plesurable. On the other hand, if you wanted a really good book by Bill Root, try Commonsense Bidding and Modern Bridge Conventions. I haven't read his book on defence, but that looks promising as well"
2,Type Too Small for Old Eyes,"I just received book. I bought it used for less than $5, including shipping. I am very glad I did not spend more. I think that the information in book is very helpful, but the type is so small,(10 point or smaller) that I doubt I will struggle with trying to use this book."
3,"Rather boring, but can be pretty good","This book is rather boring through the first half or so. Otherwise, it's a really good book and has some interesting stuff in it about important modern day people."
2,Big Disappointment,I love Elton John and was really looking forward to his new album. There was not one song on it that I liked. I put it away and will never listen to it again.
4,Great bassinet for the price,"Was looking for a sturdy bassinet to replace my old one and so far, I am happy with this purchase. The bassinet is not pretty, but is sturdier than other bassinets around the same price range. However, I'm giving it four stars because the caster wheels are terrible and do not roll around on my hardwood floors (I do not know about carpets). The bassinet I received also had some minor damages, but nothing that is serious enough to raise any safety issues. If you care about looks, there is also a liner you can purchase for this.Oh and the bassinet is really low standing around 27"" in height (excluding the hood).It's perfect for me since I'm standing at 4'10"", so I don't have to bend over too much =)"
4,Not fancy but serviceable,"Although this is not the fanciest bassinet you'll find, it does everything it needs to do at a great price. We bought this for our 4th grandchild and they have been very pleased with it. Very easy to put together also!"
2,Nothing new,"I purchased this book with hopes that it would have new information. Unfortunately that was not the case. This book is very similar to Dr. John Pagano's(sp) Healing Psoriasis. If you have that book, I wouldn't waste money on this book - if you have not purchased Healing Psoriasis - this book is worth a try if you don't mind making extreme changes to your diet."
1,"Dont care if the book is well writen, what matters, is cure","If the book delivers what it promissed, i.e. natural cure from Psoriasis, no matter what the descipline that needs to be followed is, that deserve 5 stars. I dont agree with the above comments. I dont care if the book is well presented, will writen, full of anecktodes, what really matters, is to get a begining of a cure from that deseas.I am buying the book from Amazon now, will keep you informed when reading it, if things have improved."
5,Lenox Holiday Nouveau Placemats,Excellent product and price. I am very happy with the placemats which are of good quality.
5,Great buy and works very well.,"An excellent buy for the price. Would definitely recommend it to anyone needing a 12"" level. Couldn't be a better value."
5,Wow!,"Having two children of my own, ages 5 and 7, at home this story was a hit! My children could both relate to the characters and found different perspectives to appreciate. The illustrations kept us grownups giggling right along with the kids! A must have book for anyone with more than one child!"
3,Chlorine destroyed the poor thing...,"I really liked this suit initially. It has a good, conservative fit that really grew on me. I swam laps with it for an hour three to five times a week, and it did really well for about 3 months, then it started to really deteriorate from the chemicals. If you need a medium- to light-use suit, go for it. Otherwise you'll be buying a new one after 4 months."
5,Swim suit,Nice swim suit. Comfortable and not expensive. I recommend it to whom ever like swimming in comfort.The service is good.
3,Fades,This suit is cut too low in the underarm area and it faded after only a few days (1 hour a day) of swimming. Otherwise it is fine.
2,Not so good,"I bought this for a water fitness class. I have to give it thumbs up for the fit and comfort. However, after just 2 months despite washing after each class in fresh water this suit has faded horribly. The fade is splotchy so it is very obvious - it would have been better if it faded evenly all over. I am very disappointed as I spent a lot for this item and thought I was buying quality."
1,This suit fades,This swimsuit faded after a few times in the pool. The actual styling is great but unless they can fix their styling problem this suit is useless.
5,comfortable,"These are some of the most comfortable sandles I've ever had. The first pair I bought was on a whim while vacationing in Hawaii. I needed a pair of sandals and these did the trick. I ended up wearing them ALL the time and they wore out, so I bought another pair on Amazon to replace the first pair. I'll be buying another pair soon. There is a bottle opener on the bottom of the sandals, which is funny. I've actually used it a couple times in a pinch. I've seen other Reef sandals with a comb in the bottom, or a tiny flask. Great conversation piece as well!"
5,Great Sandal,"I purchased this sandal four years ago, and I have finally worn it out. I replaced it with the same only new design and still love it. I have a very hight arch and it really supports my high arch. I will buy this sandal again!"
4,Great Sandal - Tough To Break In,"The bottle opener on the bottom of each sandal is the icing on the cake for this comfy shoe. Initially I had some cuts on my feet around my big toes, but after they were worn in, I was singing their praises. The shoe is cushioned with a material that is perfect for hot weather (read: sweatty feet) since it doesn't stain or make a funny noise when walking. Did 5 days walking around New Orleans recently in them and was comfortably happy with them the whole time."
5,Reef Sandal,"Just love these sandals. Very comfortable. I now have 3 pairs. Black with Silver, Brown with Silver and Black with Leopard print."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered a pair of Reef Fanning Sandals to replace my old ones that are dirty and worn out. Reefs have gotten overpriced in the last few years, but I ordered them anyway. Ordered the exact same size as my old pair, but the new ones are obviously at least one shoe size smaller. What's the point of ordering footwear online if the company can't consistently produce a size? I've worn Reefs for ten years, but having a bottle opener in a shoe is not a good enough reason to drop good money on an inconsistent product. You can always opt for a bottle opener on a keychain and quality flops on your feet."
5,Most comfortable shoe in the world!!,"You will never want to wear anything else! I would never have dreamed of wearing a sandal to an amusement park in the past, but I did. I walked around in these for 12 hours and my feet felt great! I now own several pairs and prefer them to any other shoe in my closet. Even more comfortable than slippers! And the built in bottle opener does come in handy. I highly recommend purchasing!!"
4,Lighter than pictured,"I love my Fannings. People with high arches like mine are often unable to wear flipflops, but these are an exception. The quality seems consistent with my 3 year old pair as well.That said, I would not buy this color again. They are so light that they show dirt like crazy, and I have to wash them a lot. Maybe they would be self-cleaning as beach shoes, but I don't live near the beach, so I'm disappointed with the maintenance."
4,"love it, but wrong style","I love the shoe, but I did not get the style it said i would get. It gives you the one in this picture, but I picked one of the other styles and every time I try to pick another style it keeps giving me this one."
4,Great Casual Flip Flop,Liked this flip flop so much I bought some for my mom. I think she wears her's more than I wear mine! These sandals are so comfortable and great from hanging out at the beach to going shopping at the mall. I highly recommend buying a pair if you can spare the extra cash you'll pay for them.
2,Not the quality I was anticipating,"Like the fit, the style, the comfort-- but I have owned these sandals for <3 months, and they are already starting to show significant wear at the toes (rubber is starting to ""fray""). For the price, I expected them to certainly weather the summer, but I'm not sure that will be the case (particularly since we have ""long"" summers here). I bought these to replace a pair of O'Neills I had for 3 years-- unfortunately they stopped making the model I liked/owned, so these were as close as I could find, but the quality is just not there-- definitely lacking. I would not recommend these, regardless of how ""novel"" the bottle opener on the bottom is. Who opens a drink with a shoe, after all (dirty-- eck!)?"
5,"I love Reef Sandles, They are the Best!","Reef Sandles are the best, they are really comfortable. I have been wearing them for ever."
1,wouldnt buy it either,"Your friend Tom.i agree with holly. the review of a book is chosen by the author or publisher to represent the contents of a book. choosing an offensive critique of women in general as either ""skinny little stick women"" or ""regular women"" does say a lot about the contents of the book or it shouldnt of been chosen. i think its disgusting. reviews are listed by authors and publishers to represent the contents of a book, period. toned and fit women are attractive as belly dancers as watching the body and muscles moving is more interesting than watching a bowl of jello bouncing. describing overweight women as regular only enforces are cultures chronic obesity and all the associtated health problems as diabetis and heart disease etc. this isnt at all necessary and very offensive."
5,Old Dutch Pot Rack,"I am a lover of all things to do with cooking. So it wasn't surprising when we ran out of space in the cupboards. We bought the pot rack in November. It came with great instructions, suggestions for keeping it balanced and lots of hooks. We are very pleased with the quality of the product."
4,Gift,Purchased this to give as a house warming gift. It was the perfect size for the new kitchen and the new home owner was delighted.
5,Excellent taste!,This is an excellent product for quality and taste. I like the individual packets to dispense the right dose.
4,Easy to take,"I'm not a pill person, just can't swallow them unless I get some practice with smaller pills first. Seeing how most Omega 3 pills are huge, I just can't take them.Coromega is rather pleasant tasting, with no fishy taste. Not 100% they're better than the pills, but they're certainly easy to take."
4,Good in yogurt,"I won't comment on absorption rates or the effects of Omega-3 in general, those being either highly technical or subjective.I will comment on the taste and convenience though.I tried eating one straight (it lists this as an option in the description) and didn't enjoy it much. The flavor comes in three waves: First, orange. Second, orange cream, and the third is an unpleasant aftertaste that lingers until you wash it away with something.Mixing it in yogurt solves the aftertaste problem. I would imagine it would be good in smoothies also.Regarding convenience, I don't like taking pills, so I find mixing this in with some yogurt to be more pleasant.I found it difficult to find actual amounts anywhere, so I posted pics of the supplement facts and ingredients. Also, here is the EPA/DHA info:Each packet (90ct) is 2500mgFish oil 2000mgLong chain Omega-3 fatty acids 650mgEPA 350mgDHA 230mg"
4,Nice way to supplement your diet,"With all the press on Omega-3's lately. Its hard not to take notice and start considering if you are getting enough in your diet. This is an easy way to do it as it can be mixed with different foods and is a relatively small but effective dose. My reason for not giving it 5 stars is the taste while tolerable isn't the greatest and I probably feel that if you can find a pill form of omega 3 that provides the same amount of the fatty acids I'd prefer to take that. However, if you have problems swallowing pills this is for you."
5,Easy Supplementation,I have been taking this product for about 4 months now. I recommend it to anyone looking to add Fish Oil to their diet. This product tastes great (no fishy taste) and the squeeze packet is the easiest way to take a supplement!!
5,The best Omega 3 supplements,"This is the best Omega 3 supplements I have ever taken. It takes good (a big factor as I don't like fish), it's easy to take & extremely convenient, especially for travel. I love it."
5,Coromega - Best Omega -3 Supplement Available,This product is excellent. It's tasty and a great supplement. The montly delivery schedule works best for my family. Amazon sells it at the lowest price.
4,Not Bad,"The orange flavor was surprisingly strong and took some getting used to, but overall pretty good. It's much better than taking fish oil pills which tend to give me an upset stomach."
4,Not tasty but no hint of fish taste,"This is probably as tasty as fish oil can get. You can't taste or smell the fish at all. That is not to say it tastes like fresh squeezed orange juice or anything, but given the flavor they are covering up it is probably the best that can be done. It is kind of an oily paste the consistency of toothpaste. That consistency is not all that pleasant, but at least the packets are small (2g) so there is not much to eat. I keep it in the fridge and eat it cold rather than at room temp. It seems better that way."
5,Best Thing Since Sliced Bread,"I started taking this as recommended by my Doctor for high cholesterol (not this particular brand, just fish oil). I tried this because of the positive comments such as no fish burps and easy to take. The pleasant, unexpected side effects I experienced were as follows:No more pain from arthritis in my thumbs (I have had this pain for several years).No more shoulder pain (injured doing a yoga move and had physical therapy following injury and was left with everyday pain in my shoulder joint and some tingling and numbness down my arm. It is gone.Softer skin.More alert.I recommend this to anyone who will listen. I had no expectations when I starting taking this. I will never be without it!"
5,Good Stuff!!!,"This product is well worth the money.It is a nutural product and has even helped the pain in my back and my knees.I cant hardly believe it has helped so very much.I suffered for so long,it is truly a blessing!!!Thanks Amazon!!!"
4,Coromega Review,"Product seems good. It was recommended to me by a Dr. Can not tell a difference from my previously used Omega supplement, but will continue to use. Amazon has a good price."
2,experienced issues while taking it..,"Shortly after I started taking this supplement daily, I experienced pretty noticeable intestinal problems (belly ache, diarrhea). Not suspecting this as the cause, I wondered why but kept taking it for about a week, until it dawned on me that this supplement might be the cause. I stopped taking it, and the issue went away the day after. Hoping my body may get used to the ingredients, I started taking it again and the problem returned the same day. This repeated about 4 times after I stopped taking it altogether..Since most reviewers are not having any issue with it, either I got a bad batch or somehow it does not go well with certain people.. FYI, I am lactose intolerant, but I don't know if this has anything to do with the issue I was experiencing."
4,Expensive but the kids love the taste,"These are pricey, but our kids love the taste (even our 2yr old).A great way to get especially young or picky kids to down their Omega-3s."
4,Great Stuff,This is great stuff. My child's behavior has really stabilized with this. It also tastes good. We tried some other gummy stuff and he gummied it to death and and still had some to spit out. The only negative comment is that the Kids Caromega and the regular Caromega is packaged too similarly. My son noticed that the tiger wasn't on the second set we bought. It turned out to be the regular Caromega.
4,the taste is perfect,I dotn mind the taste at all - its a bit fishy very little. My son doesnt mind the flavor hes 5 but my daugther is 9 and will only have it shaken with some oj. Overall i am overly pleased with the product.
4,Good for fish oil,I'd rather take regular fish oil. I was hoping my kids would think this was great. Not so much. But it tastes OK.
4,Nice Orangy taste!,"It has a nice orangy taste. But for me and my daughter, the after taste was a little less to be desired. By my other two kids love it.The orangy taste kinds of reminds me of the orange flavored chocolates. If this is mixed with chocolate, this would've been a blast!"
4,OMEGA 3 squeez packets,This product has very good tast and is easy to bring with you. Many supplements have a bad after tast and you need a pill box for the afternoon dose but this product is different in both areas. I have liked the orange so much I have not yet tried the lime flavor.
5,Fish oil without the fishy smell!,"My son has been on fish oil supplement for years and this is by far the best option! The pills all leave him with fishy breath, burps, etc. Not fun! With these I just squeeze it in a spoon and he feels like he is getting a treat, like a spoonful of orange flavored pudding! This also has the correct amount of omega 3's (at least according to my son's doctor). These also travel really well, if you are going away for a week just grab 7 packets and go instead of a whole bottle of pills! The price might be slightly more than buying pills but is well worth the convenience, great taste and no fishy burps! I highly recommend this product."
4,Tasty!,Delicious. No problems taking this everyday. I'll update this in the spring after its been a year and see if my numbers have improved!
5,Review of Omega 3 Jell,This product is amazing. My neighbor had it and I was so impressed I went to Amazon and bought for myself!
3,"Unpleasant taste, but a good source of omega-3 oils","When I eat a packet of this oil, the first taste that hits me is an unpleasant bitterness. Then a thick, overpoweringly artificial ""orange"" flavor. Then the sweetness comes on, but it too is overpowering--it does take away the bitterness but it's so strong it's unpleasant in its own way. The aftertaste is the artificial orange and a slight bitterness, but it disappears very quickly if you eat or drink anything (which can't be said of fish oil!)I will still be buying this because I believe it's a quality form of omega-3 oils, but I could not call it delicious by any stretch.Cons: Tastes bad: Too bitter, too sweet, heavy ""artificial orange"" tastePros: Quality blend of absorbable omega-3 oils, tastes less unpleasant than plain fish oil (with no ""fishy"" taste), convenient single-serving packets, and though the taste is unpleasant it is quickly and easily removed with food or water (unlike regular fish oil, which tends to linger.)"
3,Tastes like sorbet . . . fish sorbet,"if you're into Omega-3, Coromega is a somewhat tolerable way to take the supplement. the individual packets are like a condiment packet and you can squeeze it out directly into your mouth or onto a piece of bread. to me, it tastes like orange fish sherbet. the unopened box and individual packets smell strongly of fish, so have a well sealed container to store these unless you want your whole house smelling like fish all the time. and if you carry a packet with you, have a container for that.currently, each packet is 2.5 grams of fish oil and vegetable oil (20 calories) having 350mg EPA, 230mg DHA and vitamins C & E. pharmaceutical grade.consider getting as much omega-3 as you can from natural foods like fresh salmon, tuna, avocado and walnuts."
5,Tastes Great!,"I've only had one dose but it actually tastes good. Kinda wish I'd tasted more of it than I did! As far as the benefits, that's yet to be seen."
1,Disgusting!!!,"The aftertaste is HORRIBLE!!! After reading all of the other reviews I thought it was worth a try. I have been trying to find a great source of Omega Fatty Acids for the family. This is not the one! The initial taste isn't bad but the aftertaste really is horrendous. It is worse than the worst diet soda aftertaste that you can imagine. I didn't like it but had other members of my family try it independently (without me sharing my opinion, as I had hoped not to have wasted the money) No one liked it. (46, 40, 8 years, 4 years, and 2 years.) The little ones wouldn't take more than a tiny taste and made wretching faces and noises. I'm back to using the Gummy Vites Omegas for the little ones and the Nordic horse pills for the adults. They might not be as effective but at least we can actually eat/take them."
1,Bought this product because of the reviews.,I have had trouble trying to get my boy to eat fish oil. I tried these because they got great reviews. I was very disappointed. He wouldn't eat it. I ate it after he wouldn't and it made me gag. I could taste the fish oil strongly. Not sure how others thought these were tasty. It was a waste of money!
4,"Juicy, delicous","I hoope it really helps, and works, not just being delicious. Not a bad product. I cant stop using because its so sugary."
2,not for me,gave me headaches. first i didn't know why i was getting them and then my dad who was using it as well started complaining..so i made the connection. stopped taking it and the headaches stopped. Give it a try I guess
2,"Great concept, horrible taste","I am really disappointed in this product. I found these on amazon after seeing an ad for them in my Whole Living magazine. I thought it would be a great way to get more Omega 3's into my families diet. Well, the concept is great & we would be thrilled if we could get past the taste. I'm surprised to see so many positive comments about the taste, all 5 of us thought it was sickly sweet & also had an artificial sweetener aftertaste. (& It's pretty crazy when my kids think something is too sweet!) Blech, not at all what we were expecting. I may try adding it to a smoothie but I'm a little leery b/c I'd hate to ruin a perfectly good smoothie!"
5,Great stuff!,Best way I found to get the Omega3 and great tasting as well. I take one in the morning and one at night and it shows in my blood work!
3,Good Overall with few concerns,"Coromega has worked out well for me and my wife - It has improved our sleep and indigestion issues. It is one of the omega3 product that is absorped very well by our body.My concern is whether this product from Amazon is the same as what I get at a store. The reason, we had back pains after taking coromega from amzn.Another concern is, it is decreasing my cognition, few hours after taking coromega and lasts for atleast 8 hours. so I would suggest to take it before you go to bed.- Jay"
4,Hard to give this an educated rating,"How can one tell if fish oil is ""working""? I haven't had comparative cholesterol tests, haven't noticed and significant (at least causal) improvement or unimprovement in health.This stuff tastes... er... well, like a glop of sweet medicine. Washed down with some water, it's harmless taste-wise, with no discernible aftertaste. No fish-burps. No horns growing on my head.I mean, what can I say? I hope this is ""working"" because it's not cheap. I guess I'm just taking it on faith. Hmm. :\"
5,Coromega fish oil,My husband & I have been using this Coromega for a few years now. Many friends and family also use it. It is a great way to get your Omega 3s in without the slightest taste of fish oil! I highly recommend it. The packets travel well and are my breakfast dessert every day.
5,Yum!,"Before trying this product I had taken fish oil capsules, which resulted in fish burps. No fish burps with Coromega! It tastes great too. I gave it to my family for Christmas."
3,taste,"i hate the taste.it could be worse, but that doesn't matter.i tried mixing it with other drinks to no avail, and it just made it worse.i had about 5 packets before i quit.if you don't care for taste and are ready to stomach it for the health benefits, than go for it! maybe you will like it."
1,Cancer causing product!!!,This supposedly healthy product has the ingredient sodium benzoate which is known to be carcinogenic. And when taken with vitamin C (which it contains as well and with which most health conscious individuals supplement) produces benzine which is thoroughly dangerous. Talk about a toxic blend! Anyone can research it themselves on the internet. I find it a disgrace that something like this is being marketed. I was stupidly giving it to my children for nearly a year before I researched the ingredients and made the discovery.
5,Compelling story,"I loved this compelling, richly textured, vividly descriptive story. Not only was I transported into Chinese culture over four generations of the author's family, but into how family patterns and cultural mores impact us all. I was also inspired by the hope in this book. The author transcends many obstacles, including family abuse, and courageously builds a meaningful, new life."
2,bland,"Okay, may be the story is quite emotional, but it definitely did not come across that way. Lines such as ""Won-hoy got married to a rich wife, and had 5 kids"" goes on and on... giving the reader no motivation to continue."
5,Great look,"I've washed it with regular dish soap and it still looks good after use. It is not dishwasher safe, but it's not a big endeavor to wash by hand."
1,this is just a home made video,"Just a homemade video of a demo. Must be some parent filming looking for his kid, trying to make some money to pay for all this."
5,This book taught me how to market,"I already knew sales, and product development. ""Sell it Baby"" taught me how to expand those skills and develop new channels for promoting my business.It was a fun and easy read,a great companion on a business trip. This book taught me that there is a science to marketing, but it's not rocket science."
2,I wanted good clips but......,I bought a Conair instant heat hairsetter and I need the clips for best results so I bought it too. The point is that the clips are weak and you can't grab firmly you hair on the roll. The result..... bad curls !!!!!!
2,Kind of Cheap,These clips were a little cheaply made and the teeth were too long. I'd recommend them only to people that are lookig for a cheap alternative. My advice? Do NOT look for a cheap alternative.
2,Made from inferior plastic,"I already had some of these that I bought 3 years ago at a brick-and-mortar beauty supply store. These new ones, although boxed as Conair Super Clips, do not even come close to the quality of the ones I already had. These are made from inferior plastic - not as rigid as the ""real"" ones - and they are ever so slightly smaller. They barely work to keep my fine hair rolled in place. If you have thick and/or long hair, these will not do the job. Buy ""real"" ones from a brick-and-mortar store."
2,not all that impressive,"the main character was annoying, the middle of the novel dragged very slowly. the quality of the writing in general was rather poor."
3,a good workout in a short time,"I love that there are 3 short sessions. I wish there was more variety in each session. He only does a couple poses and has you do them each 3 times or so. It gets a bit boring, even though it is short. I feel great after, its a nice stretch, but wish there was more variety. I do like that they are dressed, lets say covered well enough."
3,Definitely for beginners,"This is my first exposure to Jason Crandell, but not to yoga workouts. Although the AM routine is good for mornings when I'm really lacking motivation, feeling a little weak or sick, or if I just want a super easy routine, it doesn't really feel like a workout. However, this would be fantastic for absolute beginners, with no background or experience in yoga."
2,Extreemly Disappointing!,"As a college football fanatic, I could hardly wait to get my new book for the coffee table, but I have been disappointed since the moment I opened it. First, the pictures are of very poor quality (grainy in many cases) and are not at all engaging. Some photos depict an empty stadium shot from many feet above! To make matters worse, the description that accompanies each stadium is very mundane. If you want a book to flip through once, then this may be for you. If you desire a book that emanates the college football spirit, I would recommened looking elsewhere."
5,We keep reading it over and over,"5 stars all the way! Great job Wolfes. I've been waiting for something like this to come out. The color pictures are very inspiring, Although my school's stadium picture was not perfect quality, most were. The authors explained in the front of the book that they contacted all schools to send photography. Apparently some didn't and the smaller schools never get much photo coverage and exposure of their games. Overall, this book is read on a consistent basis in my home for that last two seasons. Several have been bought as gifts for friends."
3,Middle of the road book,"Okay book, I would have preferred more photographs in the book. The book is an easy read, though I disagree with the rankings of some of the stadiums."
4,Landmark of Gay literature,"Julian Green's 1931 novella about a young man who comes to awareness of same-sex desire is a landmark of Gay literature, long out of print. Still, readers who encounter _The Other Sleep_ may find that this voice from the past eerily resembles that of the contemporary Gay writer Edmund White. (I suspect that Green, not Proust, is White's true literary forebear.) Half a century before the classic coming-out novel _A Boy's Own Story_, Green explored very similar emotional territory, and did it at least as well as White.That said, Euan Cameron's translation is much too mannered and precious for my taste. Green has generally been ill served by his translators (which is why, outside of France, he has never been as widely read as he should be), and Cameron is no better or worse than the rest of the lot."
5,Himalayan Salt Rocks,"Fast shipping, well packaged, samples too(thanks). Would reorder from seller! Bought to make sole. Have not seen any difference in the bodies PH balance. We will see."
4,Preschool & Simple,"IT'S SPRINGTIME IN MY BACKYARD By Kathy Mazur is a simple pre-school picture book about a child's relationship with a pair of ducks, Molly and Moe, that return each year in spring to live in her backyard. The photos and childish drawings are by the author, and the child pictured is her own daughter, Lauren. Lauren, now seven, reads the book on the CD that comes with it. This refreshingly simple book teaches about wildlife, trust, and caring"
5,EARLY EIGHTIES ROCK AT IT'S BEST,COMING FROM UPSTATE NY I TOOK AWHILE FOR Y&T TO MAKE IT'S PRESENCE KNOWN TO ME BUT THIS ALBUM IS ALL IT TOOK. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH Y&T START HERE. IT'S WORTH LISTENING TO THE BEST BAND FROM THIS MUSIC TYPE IN THIER EARLY STAGES.
5,very funny,"You mean you have not read each and every Pamplemousse saga? You simply must! I imagine Michael Bond, the author of the wonderful Paddington Bear books, taking an ""adult"" break every once in awhile - the result being Pamplemouse. The books are adult without being crude, hysterically funny, brilliantly written, and just plain fun. Oh, and did I mention the dog? Every dog will aspire to be Pommes Frites, every culinary critic (or food lover!) will want MP's job, and every mystery lover will laugh."
5,Cushioned Ride for Distance Running,I run 10 miles a day in these shoes. They are great for runners with a neutral gait who want cushioning with light weight. I only wish the Gel Cumulus 9 was still being made...I like them better than the later Gel Cumulus models.
3,"okay, but disappointed",They are not as comfortable as I had read in some of the other reviews before I bought them. Got bad blisters on both heels the first time I wore them.
1,For TILE surface ONLY! BOO,"We have the plastic type walls and this DOES NOT stick to the walls for nothing! Very disappointed! I expect better quality with Baby Einstein products, as the majority of their stuff is great quality. But this is a bummer set =("
5,One unbeliveable Texas based Blues Band.,The Hadden Sayers Band is one of the top new bands coming out of the Houston area. Haddens incredible guitar-playing ability combined with his soulful voice is great. I highly recommend seeing their live show. They are currently playing a curcuit for Intrepid Artists. See their web page.
2,Cervical Pillow,Pillow was not as firm as I was expecting. I have slept on cervical pillows for the past fifteen years. The pillow only lasted me a few days until I had to purchase a firmer one from another source.
4,Sarah Vaughan and a Brazilian dream team of instrumentalists,"This is the first of Sarah Vaughan's recordings in Brazil with Brazilian material and Brazilian instrumentalists.Helio Delmiro on guitar, Sergio Barroso and Novelli on bass, Chico Batera and Wilson das Neves on drums, Jose Roberto Bertrami (from Azymuth) and Edson Frederico on piano make up the dream team among other guest soloists. Guitarrist Helio Delmiro specially shines on virtually all tracks!Milton Nascimento and Dorival Caymmi sings along with Ms. Vaughan each one in their own compositions. A beautiful toast to those great composers but with neglectable results, unfortunately. Antonio Carlos Jobim plays the piano on his ""Someone To Light Up My Life"".Repertoire showcases Bossa Nova and post-Bossa Nova standards, all sung in their English versions. A mix of obvious and not-obvious Bossa Nova for Americans, featuring the Bossa standard ""The Day It Rained (A Chuva)"" as composed by Durval Ferreira."
2,"sarah saves it, but...","As happened so many times in her career, Sarah Vaughan is caught in a series of terrible arrangements in this album (cue the mushy strings). And, as happened so many times, she triumphs over many of them. This album is uneven, at best, and just wretched at worst. What on earth is ""Das Roses"" doing on this album, for instance? Then again, she breathes amazing life into Chuva, Empty Faces, and Like a Lover. I'm sorry that Jobim allowed ""Se Todos Fossem..."" (If Everyone Could Be Like You) to transmogrify into ""Someone to Light Up My Life."" Although Sarah does a nice enough job on the English torch-song version on this album (accompanied by Jobim), to hear the best version of this song, as a love song (not a torch song), check out Gal Costa's live performance on ""Jobim and Friends,"" which is a great concert from beginning to end."
5,Peace in a world of chaos,I use this CD almost exclusively when I am meditating. After 9/11 I found it was the only CD I could bear to listen to and it helped me to journey through the more difficult passages. It's digital perfection. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a bit of peace in a world of chaos.
1,Wouldn't purchase from them AGAIN!,Took forever to get the product after it was shipped to the wrong address and I was then forced to pay for shipping again or paying a restocking fee. I don't recommend them!!! Not worth the hassle!
4,Good deal on In-Ear Headphones,"Got these Opus In-Ear Headphones just before taking a trip to Europe to replace the original iPod earphones that are OK for normal use but terrible in an airplane because of all the engine background noise. The Opus performed very well, they do block a fair amount of noise which allowed to hear the music without having to crank up the volume to the max like I had to do with the original iPod earphones. I found them comfortable and ended up wearing them pretty much non stop for 10 + hours on each fligth. The music quality is good for the price of this unit. If you don't want to spend a fortune for a good overall in ear headphone, I do recommend this one."
5,One of the best,"Having read ""Game Architecture and Design"", which I consider the best game design book written, I was anxious for the follow-up from Andrew Rollings. I was not disappointed. Overall, this book covers unique material, but is aimed more toward the less experienced game designer. It's a great companion to his first book.I highly recommend both books, and I suggest reading this latest book, co-authored by Ernest Adams, first, and then follow-up with the larger, more advanced book co-authored by Dave Morris. Together, they provide a comprehensive guide to making fun, successful games.Scott Miller, CEO3D Realms"
5,A must for sound engineers,"A seriously good book that take you deep into the sound engineer subject.The book has exellent microphone technique knowlege that can be very helpfull when working in studio. The english used in this book is not too hard to understand, and its very international. I use this book more like a handbook for guideing me through difficult problems that might appear when recording music.Producer Mht"
1,Nothing Professional About This Book,"This book should be avoided. There is nothing in this book that cannot be easily accessed in a few minutes on the internet, for free. Indeed, the only way the publisher of this book could justify its printing is if it came with Crayons for coloring the pages. Seriously, I was shocked and disappointed with the lack of information."
4,nice,"This is a nice book .. i expected more pictures .. but after all , this is a nice book .This book book cover a large range of instruments and there are lots of good tips in the EQ. Chapter ."
2,"Not the best, by far.","To make a long review short: You would be much better off playing Old Timer (Motor City), or even Detroit. This game is like a shoddy remake with flashier graphics."
2,Car Tycoon a few trucks short of a full delivery,"While I was expecting an average car simulation game, I have been deeply dissappointed by the Car tycoon. I expected something close to Roller Coaster Tycoon. This game is not even close. I enjoy the potential of building different car models and research, buying other parts form suppliers, I dislike the bugs that continue to plague the system. Too many times the sound cliches or system stops in the middle of something for about 30 seconds. The map is pretty. But it is useles. No markers for the outsourceing of components on the map and no way to measure your success other than the weak graph that sinks as you borrow money. The manual is useless and the WEbsite is yet to be completed. All from a game released 2 months ago. I agree with the reveiw below.SOme german needs to do his homework."
1,Horrible Game!,"This game is horrible! It has no point whatsoever and things take forever to do! I sometimes leave it there for hours so it can do something, and when I come back, POOF! All my money has gome down the drain! Sheesh!"
2,Ouch! Save yourself some $$ and pass this one by...,"I am into cars and sims-and like many others, I was hoping this was the game I had been waiting for. Simply put: it isn't. I got through the first ""year"" only to have the game freeze (negating that hour or so of playing). The instructions/controls are extremely confusing. Also, while playing, it is very hard to figure out if you are profiting or not, because the cost of each car only includes the components used and does not include labor, etc. The website is worthless. With a few good patches and a complete/corrected instruction manual, this game might be OK-but it's probably too far gone even for that. Obviously they were trying to cash in on the ""Tycoon"" series popularity. Don't confuse this with the real thing!"
1,Don't buy this game,"I bought this game because I loved cars. When I loaded it I found messages kept coming up in German. I returned the game for a new one. This seemed to work fine. I then noticed that the woman in the bottom right hand corner of the screen sometimes speaks German. I then discovered that sometimes when trying to sell off models, they get stuck and you can't remove them. The biggest problem I found though was that I put in 7 hours of work into a supposed ""open ended game"" to find that once saved, and I was the leading manufacturer, when reloading the game it comes up with a message saying ""Time has expired"" and then a message saying ""competitor has attained goal"". I would never but this game again, or anything from this supplier. I would never recommend them and if there were a similar game around by another supplier I would buy it because I don't think it could be any worse than Car Tycoon."
5,Memorable,"This movie had such a profound effect on me as a child that I have never forgotten it. Watching it again for the first time in my adult life, I realized that I didn't understand it was the fiercely portrayed roles of Spencer as the older brother/caretaker (who made you believe he was carrying out their mother's dying wish) and Wagner, the over-indulged, spoiled much younger brother, that caused the lasting impact. They were believable.Coming from the asphalt jungle, I had never seen snowy mountains, so if anything was contrived it went over my head. I loved the tension and excitement of the climbing scenes. This movie is about the choices of 2 brothers -- one good, one bad -- and the devastating consequences that result for both."
2,Mountain Climbing is not for the faint of heart,I enjoyed this movie and saw it years ago. I decided to buy it because of the mountain climbing episodes and the interaction between climbers(brothers).
1,This Import of The Mountain is transfer from VHS,"The movie to me is a five star & one of Spencer Tracy's finest performances. The edition with Korean & Chinese subtitles [THE MOUNTAIN with Spencer Tracy (Import Edition)(Adventure) (1956)], as shown in the cover image of this product has been transferred from VHS - probably the same edition sold by Paramount in VHS 20 years ago. I was very disappointed as i already had a copy from the same VHS edition--(the screen noise & dust specks make me think it IS the same NTSC VHS Paramount edition), & I think, the one i already have is a hair better in image crispness, thus a slightly better transfer made by Euro International DVDs. A wonderful movie & hope it will receive a proper digital transfer, if not from Paramount, from the company that is now doing some of the old Paramount pics. I apologize for disappointing anyone who believes they are getting a genuine transfer from other than VHS source."
4,"The Mountain, a rare gem","If you want this movie there is no need wait, god knows how long, for a completely restored copy. Although it is not perfect like the colors are a little too vivid and the audio isn't perfectly synced overall the quality is good enough to enjoy what I consider one of those rare gems that Hollywood often overlooks. The first month I had the CD I watched the movie three times."
1,So disappointed!,"I agree with the other review. It's a cheaply made game, and the instructions didn't make sense that one ship could fire 8 times per turn. It was very frustrating when the pegs kept falling out and it was difficult to see the grid to determine if it should be a hit or miss. What a rip off."
3,Not bad,"For the price I paid for it, this game isn't bad at all. As far as the pegs go, as mentioned in the other reviews they could fit a little better; but in the set I received at least, they were a far cry from falling out at the slightest breath. Perhaps they switched pegs during production.It does add an interesting twist to the classic game of Battleship, in that you have the different ship shapes that need to be sunk, each with their own ""weak points"". It seems to me that after playing it enough, you would get to recognize which ships the opponent has by their shapes though. You don't have the freedom to position all over the board like classic Battleship, so it may give an unfair advantage to someone who is familiar with the game. I haven't played it enough to decide that point yet.In summary, it's not really a spectacular game, but it's not bad either. I can say I was pretty satisfied with the purchase."
1,Junk,"These lights looked really great, as described by many of the more positive reviews. Unfortunately, the bad reviews were also accurate. The bulbs burned out in less than a month of using them about 4 hours per night on a timer. And they didn’t just burn out. One got noticeably dimmer and more yellow that the other for days before finally dying. Looked really bad. So after they both burned out I tried to replace them with the extra bulbs that were included. Everything went fine, but it turns out it wasn’t that the second bulb had burned out. It was actually the transformer. After one month this P.O.S. doesn’t have any current going to the lights. Garbage. Don’t buy or you’ll be sorry."
2,Broke after a year,"Not worth it, and the wires are unattractive and cumbersome. Wish they would make high powered battery operated lights instead of these cheap things."
2,Disappointed in quality of product,Product arrived with a broken light bulb. This was disappointing as it appeared to be packaged well.
1,Halogen!? Around plants!?,"I bought this product before truly and carefully reading the description. But after opening the box and plugging it in to test, I felt the heat radiating from the HALOGEN bulbs and realized they would ignite any plant in the direct path of the light. So this is a massive FAIL.Hello!? LED!!!!"
3,My Pre-Halloween review,"The Main lead is unlikeable but still relatable in some right. It also has too many plotholes like ""Why do they have to get the monster by midnight if the stuff and the castle are not going anywhere?"" The upside is that the claymation is first-rate. The jokes in this tape are funny. The voice acting is good. Overall,It's not great but pretty good. I give this tape a 7 out of 10."
1,Don't waste your money!,I was so disappointed with this book. It was so boring and didn't say anything to add to this very important topic. The chapters just had statisics with just a few references to behavior or solutions. Please don't waste your money on this one. The best one so far was the one written by Robert Hare.
4,Classic Scent,"This scent becomes a signature. It's my all time favorite. It's light and never hard, or overpowering. Feminine without being fru-fru or girly. This set is nice. The shower gel worked well but the lotion is a little runny and thin. But overall a very good set for the money."
2,Too General,"I purchased this DVD to get some tips from a pro on roofing. This DVD is very general and in parts will give inaccurate measurements. Do not rely on this DVD for all shingle application. The concept is good, but lay some shingles out and make sure the system works for your particular shingles. Beware of the line layout section."
5,Boss in Motion!,Boss In Motion is the only cologne that I would wear that has a fruity type of smell to it but still smells mature. This cologne leaves women speechless and they just stop and stare at you as you pass by them wearing Boss In Motion.
3,Good deal,The package arrived on time ... just that the box was'nt looking that good . But i like it
2,Too strong citrus!!!,"I bought one from Macys last year. This cologne is too strong and the citrus smell just makes breathing difficult. Two times I sprayed this cologne on my shirt, I had to wash them before wearing again. I stopped using this cologne after.(and gave it as a gift to one of my friends.. Shhh :) )I only gave 2 stars because, some people might like a very strong citrus smell but I personally prefer something lighter like Aqua Di Gio."
2,error de modelo,La colonia que solicite (de esta imagen) no es la que me llego y tiene un olor muy fuerte y diferente
5,totally cool fragrance,"I use and collected some of men perfume. And this Boss in Motion by Hugo Boss are truly one of my favorite fragrance. It smell fresh and someone who stand by next to you will notice you instantly. I've been asked couple of times about what perfume I was wearing. So, try it on!"
2,waste of TIME,"i tried the turbo cooker, it was just not for me, too much work, the veggies were rubber, the noodles slimy, the muffins caved in in the center, and crumbled on the edges, opening the vent , closing the vent , remove the rack,add water, etc, just to much hassle, it was good for casserole type dishes, and steaming fish on the rack, but i was hoping the non-stick surface was a little more durable, after reading that it was not that great i returned it to the company. i much rather prefer the slow cooker, and a good non stick skillet. don't waste your money, just wish i didn't have to ship that thing back! it weighs 10 LBS! so for me it was a waste of time and money, the recipe cards were dissapointing in that it didn't CLEARLY state servings, although i guess you could figure it out, but watching my calories i kinda wanted more info, thanks."
4,Best Pot Ever!!!,The Turbo Cooker is great!! The recipe cards are easy to follow and can make a novice cook like a gourmet chef. It is definitely a must-have for the kitchen.
3,Cheaply made,"It's really good for a quick tasty meal. The food turns out really moist. The recepies are easy/basic and easily customizable. The food quide that explains how to cook other foods is very useful.My big complaint about turbo cooker is that it is really cheaply made! Don't expect that the nonstick surface will last very long if you use this pan regularly - and even if you really take care of it! Manufacturers promise that the domed lid fits securely into a groove, creating a seal for steam produced in the pan - it doesn't. The handle will also get a little ""shaky"" after a while, also rust spots keep appearing around heat vent. I have never had a pan that ""got old"" so fast!"
1,HORRID!!!,"I had been drooling over this for a year or so from the infomercials and finally broke down and bought it. It did not do what they said AT ALL! I mostly bought it because I wanted to be able to cook meat from frozen as I tend to forget to lay something out and end up eating out which gets expensive for a family of four. Well, with this I end up throwing out the food and eating out anyways. It will NOT cook your food from frozen without leaving the center frozen and the outside charred. I have regular pans that aren't the size of my stove that I can cook thawed meals in I was hoping for something I could cook frozen meals in. It is also very big and time comsuming with having to add water, open/shut valves, and turn food over every couple of minutes. Definately not worth the money."
2,Gimmicky,"The Turbo Cooker doesn't do anything that a large covered frying pan or dutch couldn't do. True, the stacking steam rack can be handy on occasion, but the ability to cook multiple foods in one pan is a bit of a gimmick. I'm perfectly happy to dirty a separate cake pan rather than have my cake ""steam baked"" (and flavored) by the vapors of my entree.If you don't already have any large cooking pans, the Turbo Cooker may be an inexpensive multi-use item. (Could be great for someone living on their own for the first time.) But if you already have a full set of cookware, there's really no reason to buy it. It's HUGE and takes up a ton of space in your cabinet.The Turbo Cooker seems to be cheaply made, but I can't vouch for how it holds up over time since I returned it within a month of receiving it as a gift."
2,"Good for steamed veggies, not much else...","The cookbook cards recipes were totally useless, I don't know where they pulled out those miraculously short cooking times. Ours turned out to be a good 2-3 times longer, and cooking meat on it is OK if you like to eat steamed/boiled meat.The only thing it does well is steam vegetables, where it finally did live up to its ""turbo"" name. Cooking pasta with it is OK too but using so little water left the pasta with a bit of a slimy coating.If you absolutely must try this product, hang on to your receipt and buy it from [some local stores that] have no-hassle return policies."
1,Don't Believe Eveything You See On TV...,"I purchased the Turbo Cooker from a local retailer (I am writing this to hopefully save someone else the money, time and disappointment). I could not wait to use my new Turbo Cooker. I purchased it to hopefully be able to cook frozen chicken and corn on the cob in 20 minutes, and make meals overall a great deal faster (like they did on tv). Well I tried my Turbo Cooker and if you like ""Jerky chicken"" and cold corn (my husband swears he bit into a piece of ice), then this is the item for you. It is HORRIBLE and does NOT do what it promises to do. I ended up taking it back to the retail store, yet they were not wanting to take it back, they did and refunded my money. I wish someone would have reviewed it before I purchased itand saved me the time and trouble.If I could rate this with ""0"" stars I would. DO NOT BUY!!! Very Dissatified!!!"
1,Loved It Until Lid Gauge Broke,"I loved this product for steaming food using little or no oil. Great for Veggies, warming up left-overs, and cooking on top of the stove. However after a year the gauge/valve on the top of the lid just crumbled off. I called the number on the Turbo cooker website. They assured me that they would send a new lid. This was in 2003. I never got it. When I called they said that it had to be back ordered. I will never buy another one. I often wonder if a lot of the new products offered via infomercials are just scams. The customer service always stinks."
2,Turbo Cooker not so great,"I previously had a Culinare Quick Cooker, which is another quick cooker that looked almost identical to the turbo cooker. It was my favorite cooking gadget and I used it multiple times a week. After a couple of years, I simply used it up, the non-stick surface gave out. When I looked for the Culinare, it was only available in foreign markets and I didn't have experience or confidence buying overseas directly. I knew two almost identical cookers came out at the same time so I tried the Turbo Cooker. The non-stick surface seemed to weaken on the first one or two uses. The food doesn't taste nearly as good as with the Culinare. I've used it maybe six times and rarely reach for it anymore when cooking. I think a wok would be a better choice."
1,"Terrible customer service, cheap product","If you buy this thing, be careful of the lid. The plastic knob on top broke after only 3 months -- and it is useless without it. I have tried in vain to contact the company, they will not return phone calls or emails. The number is not toll free, and you must wait forever to get through...if you have enough time.They say you'll save time in cooking, but they'll waste your time as you try to get customer service!Their website makes no claims about quality, which I should have checked before buying this. I haven't had it long enough for it to start rusting (see comments below). I like the idea, I only wish the product was sturdier, and the company responsive to customers who have already purchased. I'm sure my calls would be toll free and answered QUICKLY if I were calling to buy their product.The old adage holds true: caveat emptor."
4,base pan,"The product offers a healthy way of cooking but I agree the material used to make the product is inferior. Just under a year of purchase while cooking the base exploded and a fairly large hole appeared at the bottom. I can no longer use the product.I still like the product as a cook and I AM HOPING THE COMPANY will assist me with having the base replaced. Generally when using the product it could be a bit time consuming to have to add water at times,but the plus is if you take your time to understand how to use it the food usually tastes good and it is healthy."
1,Do not buy,"This cooker should be great if the valve on the cooker lid was not of such a bad quality.I cooked great with it, but it lasts me only 1 month.When I try to contact the manufacture for parts, after several e-mails to their ""customerservice"" I never got any feedback."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"GOSH! HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TOLD THAT IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING, DON'T SAY ANYTHING,BUT IN THIS CASE I MUST SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A CHEAP FRYING PAN WITH A CHEAP LID=THEY SURE MADE IT LOOK GOOD ON T.V. WE REALLY TRIED EVERYTHING SO AS TO GIVE IT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BUT WE RAN BACK TO THE RETAIL STORE FOR A REFUND=WHEN YOU CLOSE THE VENT ON TOP OF THE LID AS DIRECTED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS THE STEAM PRESSURE JUST LIFTED THE LID OFF THE PAN=BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Terrible,The turbo cooker plastic heat vent broke after 1 month. Customer service is a mess. All the times for cooking is way off. Don't waste your money.
5,Great Easy Meals,"The turbo cooker is a great appliance. It is especially good for easy meals that don't take all day to cook. The non-stick surface is great and really does clean up quickly and easily as advertised. It is easily the most used appliance in my kitchen. The recipes are great. Those of you who want some home cooking, even though you are not a great cook, you can do this and the meals will be great."
5,pain support group in a book,"I first used this book when I had tendonitis and other pain problems. The index is very good and useful. This is written from the point of view of someone WITH chronic pain, not the doctors and people who give you tons of advice. I have currently loaned my book to a friend who is recovering from breast cancer. This book fits any and all pain situations and truly covers all areas of life. I heartily recommend this book to anyone with chronic pain-especially when it is intense and constant."
2,New DVDs were not new,My DVDs said that they were new but they weren't and some of them were scratched and ruined. I was not happy with what I got because i was not able to see all of the episodes completely.
5,awesom,"this product was awesome, and it was very cheap if you go to the store and look for this its about 60 dollars, so im glad i found it on here!! if you love one tree hill i would reccomend buying them on here cheapest place to find them and in awesome condition as well!"
5,I was very pleased with this season.,"I have been a fan since episode one, and have religiously followed it ever since, never missing an episode. The show seems to get better with every season, although I must say, that while season 4 had some of the strongest episodes, there were also few disappointing episodes (I.e. The entire Derek stalking Peyton storyline, especially the horrendous Prom episode. Soooo cheesy) but I really loved the way the season ended, and eagerly awaited the premiere of season 5.Season 5 did not disappoint. I was so relieved that they didn't set the show during the college years, and make it so that all of the characters somehow went to the exact same college (in example, 90210) and instead chose to set it to four years later, while giving you flashbacks of things that happened in their college years.And best of all, this season introduces you to extremely talented singer Kate Voegele.All in all, this is a great season, and I can't wait till the DVDs are released!"
5,One Tree Hill Season 5,"I purchased this season of one Tree Hill as well as previous seasons due to the fact that Australia is so far behind (we are up to season 4 here) and it is one T.V. show that I enjoy watching. As promised, product arrived safely and on time. Thanks for the prompt delivery. Can't wait for season 6."
2,Disappointing!!!,"I was very excited to see them take One Tree Hill into the future, especially becuase the characters was now close to my age. I was extremely dissapointed becuase the storylines were the same as seasons 1-4. The writers only focused on Lucas & Peyton's screwed up relationship and not enough on the other 3 Main characters. They also focused to much on the new and secondary characters. It was either a Hit of Miss and it was definitely a miss. But at least they left a great cliff hanger with Lucas, Brooke, Peyton, and Lindsey."
4,Great Season,"Season 5 of OTH ended up a lot better than I thought it would be. When I first heard that they were fast forwarding 4 years, I thought that it was a risk and something that no other show has done before. It worked!!! With so many shows featuring the college years, it was nice to see these characters grow older, and experience life when it really begins. Although most weren't any wiser, it was nice to see what they had done with their lives, and where they are still yet wanting to go. If you are a OTH fan, this season won't disappoint you."
3,FOR THE DAUGHTER,COLLECTING THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER-SHE WATCHES THIS IN A WEEKEND SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAN HERTIME ALL SEASON LONG
5,One tree hill,FANTASTIC!!!! Any1 who likes one tree hill this is the best season yet. I can't wait to see season 6!!
5,A lovely gift any surfer will appreciate.,"There have been numerous books over the years to celebrate methods of surfing or best surfing spots: now THE HISTORY OF SURFING provides an illustrated, definitive overview of the sport and its roots. From interviews with surfing champions of previous decades to reproductions of early Hawaiian and Australian surfing photos - some never before published - this covers the great boatmen, surfers, and their equipment and techniques in full color. A lovely gift any surfer will appreciate.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,the best Carmina Burana,Eugene Ormandy directs the amazing Carmina Burana to perfection. The tempo is absolutely masterful. this is by far the best performance of Orff's masterpiece that I have ever heard.
1,Avoid these diapers,"These diapers are awful. The material is stiff and bulky and the size range is ridiculous. They are for 6-14 lbs, When my baby was 6lbs these diapers were bigger than his entire body. They finally fit now that he is 4 months. The tape on these diapers also get stuck on the baby's skin. And finally they don't deal well with leaks. If you are looking for a more environmentally friendly diaper check out the seventh generation diapers."
1,Don't waste your money,"These are the worst diapers that I have used. I was initially attracted by the all cotton/paper fiber core but soon realized that this made the diaper more like a piece of cardboard. It is difficult to get the diaper to fit snuggly around the waist because it is so stiff. The result is lots of leaks both urine and poop (the cotton doesn't absorb any of this and it ends up shooting out the front, back, and down the legs). When I was successful at getting a snug fit, the Scotch tape like fasteners would pop off. So frustrating!!! I grew tired of entire outfit changes with each dirty diaper. Save your money! Try something else!"
2,"Unfortunately, they do leak . . .","I was so glad to find disposable diapers that were both chlorine and gel-free but was sadly disappointed. I didn't find the diapers too bulky or anything, and I loved them for the first couple of days, but then I got pooped all over . . . and then it happened again . . . and again . . . and I'm not talking about a little stuff coming out of the side -- I mean poop literally dripping out of the diaper and all over the floor/my lap/his clothes. Maybe for an older baby with more solid poop they would be fine, but these diapers just couldn't contain my baby's breastmilk poop. It's due to a poor design (the inner elastic is too loose and doesn't ""catch"" anything), and if they could fix it, these would be my diapers of choice -- but until then, I can't recommend these at all.Kudos to the company for trying to make a better disposable, though; it's a good idea and I hope they can find a way to make a better product soon."
2,leaky diapers,"I like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper, so I bought Tushies. When my baby was newborn, they seemed to work ok, maybe because she didn't put out that much. She is now three months old. I practice attachment parenting so I know exactly when she has a bowel movement. The past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly. She was sitting on my lap, she had a bowel movement, five seconds later I got up to change her, the feces was all over my pants. This has happened several times. The concept of the diaper is great, but the diaper needs some work around the legs."
3,7th generation are better,"I bought these for their ""gel free"" claim. Let me tell you that the gel makes a world of difference and doesn't hurt baby. These leaked and had to be changed every hr or so.Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Diapers, Stage 2 (12-18 Lbs), 48-Count Packages (Pack of 4) (192 Diapers)are so much better, they close better, they don't leak, they can hold more. In the end I switched to Huggies Snug & Dry Diapers - Super Mega Pack - 5 because of the price. Also, I didn't think my baby needed the ""organic"" diapers much past the 3th month (her skin is less sensitive after that)."
1,watch out for leaks,I like the softness of Tushies and the fact that they don't use gel. BUT the downside is that these diapers can't hold as much liquid and you are likely to have leaks up the back and out the sides if you don't change baby enough. We had numerous problems when in public when our baby was wearing these. We have half a pack left and can only use them at home during the day when baby is going to be changed hourly.
5,Tushies Are Great!,"I've been very pleased with Tushies diapers. They pull away the moisture to prevent diaper rash without using a chemical-based gel. And they are great for babies with sensitive skin. The size small was a little big on my newborn; otherwise, they fit like a dream. I'm also happy to support Tushies diapers because they are made here in the USA. Unfortunately, Amazon has canceled Tushies from their Subscribe & Save program through Amazon Moms. It's too bad that Amazon wouldn't continue to support these diapers and in turn, help out the American economy!"
1,I got them free... still not worth it!,"After 9 years in healthcare, I consider myself a professional at diapering. I was given a package from a friend who heads a donation center where I delivered. She knew we'd had extreme financial dificulties & that our son was in the NICU (ka-ching!). He was too small for them for a while, though he was 7# 13oz at birth. They're fine enough for urine. He pees A LOT and they do handle that. Unfortunately they also become rock hard when they do! Plus they are useless against poop. After doing a second bath on him today and striping the seat he was in, I've decided to toss these. I won't even give them to anyone else! The ONLY reason why I put them on him again today is because I wanted to give him a break from the cloth diapers. Nevermind. It'd be less mess to leave him naked in the middle of the wood floor..."
5,Great for sensitive skin.,We love our tushies diapers! They are ALL cotton and great for sensitive skin. If you don't want any gel or plastic next to your precious baby's skin this is the way to go. We have never had any leaks or accidents with these. We couldn't be happier.
2,"Nice idea, but not for us","These diapers sound great. But the tabs are so sticky that they stick to my son's skin if I do not watch where they are at when cleaning a dirty diaper. Plus, when they are wet, they are quick to leak out and feel wetter than other diapers. We are just trying to use ours up and will not buy again. Much prefer Earth's Best or Seventh Generation diapers."
3,stiff but biodegradable,the tushies were a bit stiff and ran large (she is a skinny baby) but they worked just as well as standard disposables
1,Okay but Stupid Design,"This is the only gel-free diaper which is closest to cloth diapers because of absorbency from cotton. This is the only good news.The bad news is that the sizing is too large for newborns. The diapers leak, have no elastic around the waist, and are fastened by tape that stick to the babies skin."
2,Leaky diapers,"Tushies are the only diapers that are gel-free. However, there isn't enough cotton padding near the legs and leaks can be a common problem. My order from Amazon took over a week, unacceptable for something time-sensitive such as diapers."
5,Great Small Space Pot Rack,"While there were no directions for attatching the rack to the wall, we were able to figure it out and it went up pretty quickly.The rack is just the right size for a smaller apartment kitchen and really looks great. I was able to hang more on it than I thought I'd be able to and it really looks nice. I'm very pleased. For the price, it's a great item.The directions were not the best, but with some common sense it can easily be put together."
5,Perfect addition to any kitchen,"After looking at numerous wall mounted pot racks, I decided to try this one. I am so glad I did.The size is perfect, not too big but easily holds our frequently used pots & pans. I also hung a few of my favorite spoons & spatulas for easy access. The shelf is nice for storage.It came with numerous hooks, so many that I have extras in the drawer for future use.The Graphite is a great finish and super easy to clean.Installation was fairly easy. It felt a little front heavy once our pots were hung so we added 2 extra brackets to the top to ensure it could hold the weight. Don't let that influence your decision, it was an easy, inexpensive fix and we couldn't be happier. Highly recommended!"
4,Nice solution for storage problem.,"I was having finding the right pot or pan because everything was piled into one cabinet. Decided to try this rack, and it was a wonderful solution. The rack is easy to assemble and hang. There is plenty of room for all my pans...with room to spare. I do worry about hanging cast iron pans, but it seems to do well with those so far. This is all around a great product."
5,dutch pot holder,"I have really enjoyed this Dutch pot holder, it has allowed me more space and easy access to my pans and skillets. My cousin also ordered one and we are really pleased with the quality."
3,Defective Part,"Overall, I am satisfied with this product. My only gripe was with one of the nuts that was worn out and could not secure the frame. I had to purchase another nut from a local hardware store to finish the assembly."
2,Be prepared to wait a month to two months for this item,"I ordered this item on 1/14/04 and according to the Web site I would receive the item within 12 business days, (taking into account the super saver delivery by adding an additional 5 days to standard shipping) it is now February 10 and still no confirmation email stating that my package has left for delivery. I complained about it with Amazon and they sent a cryptic message that did not address the false delivery estimate on their site. If you are considering purchasing this, just be prepared to wait over a month to receive a shipping confirmation email and don't expect Amazon to provide assistance."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality","I bought a set of Anolon Professional pots and pans that I thought would work well with this half dome rack. I was really excited to receive this rack so I can put my pots on display. However, I was disapponted by the quality and craftmanship of this product. It was awkward and difficult to assemble because the alignment was off. Even the screws did not match. I was so frustrated that I dumped the rack in the trash. I ended up purchasing one from Anolon."
5,I love my new pot rack!,"I am so excited about my new pot rack. It is heavy, durable and compliments my kitchen. It was the perfect solution for my smallcabinets that didn't fit all my pots and pans. I am very happywith this purchase."
5,Perfect space saver,"Absolutely a godsend! Perfect to organize my pots and pans and looks so attractive on my wall. And even more attractive with a few fake plants on the top. Did have to go buy some toggles to handle the weight, but I absolutely am thrilled with it."
5,Just what I was looking for.....,This Pot Rack is what I've been searching for. I love it!! I received new cookware for Christmas and it looks great hanging from the rack--not to mention what a space saver this is in my small kitchen.
5,love it,"It's even more than I expected. It's strong and holds all of my pans, including the cast iron one. Compared to all the others I've seen, it isbetter and less expensive."
4,Loving my pot rack...,"Sturdy, durable, easy to put together. My only complain is it was smaller than I'd thought. It looks great in my kitchen and is doing me wonders for storage! Loving my new pot rack!"
5,Very sturdy,Lovely pot rack. The picture doesn't do it justice. I found it to be much sturdier in reality than I expected based on the image. Very nice size and the shelf is handy for covers etc... Highly recommend.
5,pot rack,Was a gift for my sister and it was exactly what she had been looking for so she is very happy as am I. Thank you very much.
4,Great little rack,"I was really worried when I ordered this pot rack that It would be too wide for my space. I tell you, It fits perfectly and It looks great too. Very easy assembley, although I had to bend a bracket a little to make it straight(possibly shipping damage). I love this pot rack, it has more than enough hangers and as long as it stays sturdy and shiney It will stay in my kitchen forever."
5,Attractive Spacesaver!,"I bought this item to replace a round ceiling-mounted pot rack. I couldn't be more pleased with this wall rack. It is much more stable than my previous rack and it takes up less space. I'm confused by the reviewer's statement that the rack only holds 3-4 pans. I have around 2 dozen pots hanging on mine! I am using all the hooks included with this rack as well as some from my previous pot rack. I could actually hang a couple more, but I'm concerned that the wall may not be able to hold too much more weight. The only problem I had with this rack is assembly. I assembled it alone but I recommend having a helper as it's nearly impossible to hold all the slats in the correct curved position without assistance."
4,The Perfect space Saver,I love this pot rack. It is strong and sturdy. With this rack I have been able to free up vauleble cabinet space for other things. A must buy for any cook with limited space.
5,As good as it looked,"After reviewing hundreds of pot racks, kept coming back to this one, simple but useful, with the rack on top to hold pan lids. I know I could've paid much more...but this was easy to install and has been great."
3,Bought it for camp,My father-in-law was having a pot and pan issue at his camp... So we bought this to help... He said it installed easily and does the job.... He was pleased with the product.... and the price on Amazon... We went shopping locally and they were trying to sell it for twice the price...
3,get what you pay for,"didnt want to spend a lot of money so I didnt. It looks good once installed but the supplied hardware is very low quality, stripped out easily so I ended up using my own higher-grade screws."
5,Pot Rack,"I ordered the wall mounted Pot Holder, the price was excellant, I would say less than half the price of others I had checked out, with free shipping, it arrived in a timely manner. The only negative thing was the assembly, it took a little while to figure out, the directions are not real clear. I am extremely satisfied with the holder, it fits against the wall, out of the way, holds about 12 pans and pots and has a rack at the top for the lids, all of this useful fuction and it looks great too."
5,Makes DC Tap Water Drinkable,Have not tried drinking from a stream or lake source yet but I can say it does work on DC tap water and ice chest water that everyone has had their hands in grabbing soda's and beers. I trust this product.
4,Talent talent talent,That's what most of the artist out there don't have. Talent!but Mr.Haka has it in his blood!Tabakete!
1,Glutamine Powder,"This item is just worst I have ever used, taste horrible and mouth feel nothing more than DIRT and DUST. The clever and client enemy manufacturer have printed the label in most UGLY design; black fine prints on the red-brown surface so the user can not read without magnifying glass. I can not see the quantity on the Jar any where. This is lot number 1280138 code # 6 66999 13100 4. by IRON-TEK. It is tried only twice and not accepted by the mouth for the DIRT DUST contents and all the jars are lying waiting for the manufacturer for the return / refund. Is that the so called Iron-Tek will ever respond ? And - Or the Iron- Tek will keep on misguiding and fooling the public ??"
1,Greening of Georgia,"This is a strange book. It seems well-researched with many citations of previously published work but very little original, if any,work. I agree with the premise of the book but find fault with the author, whoever he is, that he does not seem to understand what is going on. Perhaps he's just an old codger like me."
2,Not Totally Pleased,"This display case was in less than perfect condition when I received it. Perhaps, it could have been better packaged. The case is somewhat serviceable, however, there was a small crack in the clear plastic, which is something a serious model builder can't abide."
3,Amazing gaps,"while completed in a methodical way, this book on San Francisco slights North Beach. does not mention coit tower, the many italian restaurants and coffee houses of the quarter. if mr richards rewrites for another edition, it is hoped he would correct this egregious omission."
4,Makes the walks enjoyable!,I received this book from my brother as a gift for he knows I enjoy historic landmarks. I found this book a great read without even being present in San Francisco. Rand really puts in some great nuggets of information. The book is categorically divided by district and has a routed map along with it. My only gripe is the very little amount of pictures. I go on trips to San Francisco but I do not reside in the city. If pictures accompanied the book then the reader could enjoy it without a walk necessarily and would second as a reference during the walk in the case the reader miss located the building. It would have been an easy five stars otherwise!
4,Some good projects,A few of the projects are all plastic canvas. Some barely use the medium. It does have a few good tips and some nice patterns.
5,A wonderful Christian guide to overcoming daily struggles.,"This book is a true revelational guide to overcoming anger, obesiety, smoking, and much more. It helps puts your battle with daily struggles in Jesus' hands not your own. I recomend this book to all Christian's who fight for victory in Jesus."
3,"Nice clubs, a little short","I ordered these thru Amazon, after reading the reviews on Deep Reds on The Golf Warehouse's website. I wonder if those were a little misleading, because Wilson has been making different Deep Reds (fat shafts, for example).Anyway, solid clubs, for sure, and I get great distance on my fareway shots with the hybrids. The driver is super-short, and when I inquired about exchanging it, I was SOL. Be aware that these clubs (and others) bought on Amazon simply cannot be returned to TGW, period. 30, 60 days, new, barely new, whatever, TGW won't take them back."
4,Great for golfers,This was a gift - and he loved it. Very funny. All golfers should have such a sense of humor!
1,Learn to cheat,This is a gag gift item... a bad gag gift. There is no practical purpose to this book except to learn how to cheat. This book teaches you how to drop a ball through your pants in order to get the ball on the green. Or to place your tee shot in a better location when no one is looking and when no one saw your shot.This is a complete waste of time. I suspect the 5 star reviews are fake. This book isn't funny at all. I highly recommend not buying this book. Thank goodness I got this from the library and didn't donate my money to the author.Buyer beware.
1,This book contains almost nothing that is really funny.,"The 41 ""Chapters"" seldom invoke a chuckle and never bring forth real laughter. The promo says the book presents 112 pages, but mine seemed complete and contained only 82. I would have felt cheated, if the book had been free, and I had paid only postage."
1,Don't waste your MINIMAL time!!,"Read it in 25 minutes. Wasn't funny. Yes I'm a golfer, but the stuff in the book just isn't funny. Biggest waste of money on a book ever. I'm letting my two year old daughter use it as a coloring book."
4,Beauty from within,"This book is well done, and a loving tribute to Elizabeth Taylor. The only disappointing factor was that many of the photgraphs were ones frequently seen. It would be nice to see those rare photos of Miss Taylor, and more candids! I also found the book interesting in the fact that as Elizabeth has gotten older,her inner beauty shines through even stronger. Just look at those eyes - they tell volumes!"
3,The Boxer,"""The Boxer"" was an okay book with not a whole lot of a knockout ending. Johnny Woods a lower class kid living in the tenements of Manhattan in the 1800's is supporting his family after his father leaves 3 years earlier. Johnny is walking home from the sweatshop one night, and stops at Brodie's Saloon where they offer boxing to anyone, and the winner wins five dollars. When Johnny is fighting, the saloon is raided by the police Johnny ends up with a sentence of 6 months in prison. When in prison he meets the ""Professor"" Michael O'Shaunessy. Michael offers to train him in prison and continue to train him when they get out of prison at his Upper East Side New York Athletic Club. When Johnny gets out he is surprised with the return of his father. He now must concentrate on fights and his family. This was an overall okay book. I expected a better ending then what was given."
4,the Boxer,"The boxer is a great book that contains losts of action and family values. I think this is a great book and all audiences, children teens and adults would like it. With this book you can learn a lot and have a great time reading it. with this book you can enjoy action while many problems arise for the main character Jonny. If you like the author Kathleen Karr I would definatly recomend this book. It is one of her best yet and it outdoes any year 2000 books. This book should defanitly become a best seller!"
3,the art of catapult,i was looking for more details about the siege wepons but this was more about the historycal but it shows my something i was loking for
4,"Catapults, etc.",My grandson & I will give this a full test this summer. He'll be thrilled to make things that work.
