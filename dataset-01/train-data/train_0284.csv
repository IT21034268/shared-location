2,Extremely disappointed,"I was at the library and happened to come upon this book and was excited to find that Helen Fielding had written another book - I loved the Bridget Jones books. It had reviews such as ""Olivia Joules is the Bridget Jones of the 21st century"". It was very witty in the beginning chapters, but lingered way too long on the time when she was in Honduras and the Sudan...couldn't wait to finish it just so I could be done and move on. Overall I wouldn't suggest reading if you expect it to be anything like Bridget Jones."
1,I wanted to like this book. I really tried.,"I really wanted to like this book having enjoyed Ms. Fieldings other books. I found the book to be cliche and bigoted against Muslim's and the Middle East. I think she can do alot better. I've almsot finished the book and I don't plan to complete it. The overall tenor of the book is marked by a strained reaching for laughs and a begging to be taken seriously, neither of which occur. Don't bother with this one."
2,"Couldn't put it down, but wished I had","I stayed up half the night to finish this book, but not because it was good. The closest approximation to reading the second half of this book would be to watch a trainwreck unfold in slow motion. You can't look away, but you know that whatever you see is going to be ugly.The main character is an ingratiating, neurotic bore. The other characters are badly-drawn cardboard cutouts. And the plot? Jerky, unbelievable, and yet somehow predictable.Why did I stay up reading it? I wanted to see how the author would extract herself from the pit that she dug. Unfortunately, she did it in a most superficial and cloying manner."
2,Didn't even make sense,This book made no sense to me. I don't usually have a problem reading books but half the time reading this book I wasn't even sure what was going on or where she was. Read more like a screen play.
1,What a disappointment!,"If you loved Helen Fielding's wonderful Bridget Jones books, you're in for a very rude surprise if you read this supposed spy novel. What a boring, unfunny and pretentious book. Olivia Joules has to be one of the most ridiculous, truly stupid characters that I've ever read. She's not sure if she's falling in love with a dark mysterious bin Laden ripoff but she sure hopes he loves her. Reading her pathetic efforts to convince the bin Laden character that she also hates America so that he might fall in love with her made me gag. This nonsense doesn't even have the benefit of the humor that characterized the Bridget Jones books. Save your money and stay far, far, far away from this drivel."
3,Check your 'R's,"I don't mind the semi-vapid story line, as it is a fun read, but as many of the other reviewers are saying, I did feel that it was racially discriminatory.I think that the jibes about Muslims and Arabs were uncomfortable stereotypes. And her comments about the inbreeding incest and donkey loving on Popayan Island was a bit uncomfortable.Other than that (!!) I thought it was a fun read. But maybe misjudged.My biggest gripe, is that on the back cover story outline and in the first 50 pages of the book, Ferramo is spelt with two 'r's and then after that, with only one 'r' as Feramo!!! Terrible editing!!"
1,I tried to like it!,"I am a big Bridget Jones fan, so I had high hopes. I was so disappointed in this book. I tried, but I couldn't finish it. The characters were hard to keep straight and I didn't care what happened to any of them. Ultimately, my biggest complaint is the use of terrorism as the plot of what is supposed to be a fun beach read. This book needed to choose a genre."
1,Not worth your time or money,"Easily one of the most boring books I have ever read. I read the first 150 pages hoping it would get better, but just could not go on after that. The story makes no sense at all. Definitely not worth anyone's time or money."
1,Don't read this book,"This book would never have been published had it been written by an unknown. It has amateurish plot gaps, and is improbable beyond the permissible bounds of improbability in chick-lit. The heroine's inner monologue of paranoia is irritating, the Osama bin Laden plot device offensive."
3,It's better than Bridget,"I finished the book a couple days ago and quite enjoyed the easy read. I was a little surprised at the critics on this webpage, b/c it still is ""Chick Lit."" While I am glad it varies from Bridget's whining and the predictable plot - it still is ""Chick Lit."" I am sure Fielding isn't trying for a Pulitzer, and the book is not worthy of it - but it is entertaining. I did not get the feel from the book that Fielding was racist or insulting 9/11, the book really is not that deep. Olivia is quirky and amusing. I like how she sees and criticizes Hollywood and upper society's superficial values. In closing I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy fun read, and not to look too much into."
3,Torn between really liking Olivia Joules....,"but thinking that the story is the most ridiculous thing that I have read in a long time. Being a fan of Bridget Jones (the movie), Olivia Joules came as a reccomendation from a friend so I thought that I would enjoy.Olivia Joules is a wanna~be~taken~seriously journalist who is tired of writing meaningless fluff. Her assignments take her to all the hot spots including Miami & LA where she meets some strange characters. Wierd things start happening after she is introduced to Pierre Ferramo at a face cream launch in Miami. She is convinced that Pierre is a terrorist and is determined to prove it.Olivis has her shares of adventures and you can't help but like this girl for her charm, strive and determination. On the other hand, the storylines were a little over the top/far-fetched to me."
1,Worst book I've read this year,"I was looking forward to reading this book and now regret spending my money on it. Full of inaccuracies, predictable outcomes, editing mistakes, and inserted politics, I would not recommend this one and will probably not waste my future time on any other Fielding books."
2,i expected more,bridget jone's diary is one of my favorite movies but this book just wasn't it for me - i didnt like it at all - it was boring and drug on and on - i just couldn't finish it -
2,I just didn't get it!,"While the middle of this book was entertaining, the rest was boring and quite stupid. I wasn't much of a fan of Bridget Jones, either, so I shouldn't be too surprised this book wasn't much better!"
5,BUY THIS BOOK - ITS A FANTASTIC READ,"I originally bought this book when it was first released and it has been an all time favourite since; it's great to see it out now in ebook format. It was only when I read Olivia Joules that I found I liked it far better than Bridget Jones: the tongue in cheek humour and standard Fielding touch for character realism make it an absolute must for girly Bonds everywhere. I know this book is relatively unknown but give it a chance - I always come back to it like I would an old friend. This will be about my 16th time reading it, and I know I'll still want another go at some point! If this isn't a cult classic then hey, it should be."
3,*Overactive Imagination?* No way! I say *paranoia!*,"I've been reading lots of novels, mostly so I can say ""I read that!"" the next time someone mentions a book. For example, I read the new Helen Fielding novel (the author of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" -- that famous British ""singleton""), entitled ""Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination."" Olivia is also a single British woman who combines intelligence, intuition and outright paranoia to smell out a terrorist, and eventually seduce him into the hands of the authorities. While comparisons have been made to James Bond, I think Olivia is a much more complex character -- she has a real job as a journalist, and a real psychosocialhistory (orphaned at age 14 when her parents and brother were run over by a ""lorry"" while she stayed behind to buy some sweets and a magazine). And, of course, there's a love story involved too, so, it's a fun novel to read when you have time, like when you're vacationing!"
1,Two Thumbs Firmly Down,"I found this book to be poorly executed. the syntax was awful, detracting from the plot, which was juvenile, to say the least. this was one of the worst books that i have read, and that's to say a lot."
3,"Fun, light reading","I picked up this book after having read (and loved) the Bridget Jones' books. This book is a light, fun easy read, yet it was too long. It seemed to take Helen Fielding a while to really get into the rhythm of writing a faster-paced book. The last quarter or so of the book is the best written, but I can see how some readers might give up on the story before getting there. If someone had never read a book by Helen Fielding, I would recommend the Bridget Jones books before recommending this one. It might make a fun movie. However, I hope Ms. Fielding doesn't write any more books based on this character. One was plenty."
3,Pretty Good,"The only reason I bought this album is because of the song ""Blue.""However, the sounds of the other songs are kind of dated. ""People Are Still Having Sex,"" is a good song and also ""Alan's Got A New High-Fi.""It's definitely worth it to own the album for ""Blue"", but don't expect anything much better than that."
4,Helpful,This book was the first book that I have read that is about putting. I enjoyed it very much and I would also recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that will help your mental game. I feel with reading this book I have learned many thing that will help me next time I step on a green.
1,Should have been a Golf Digest article,"It is mind blowing to me to see so many five star reviews. This book is, AT BEST, a good article in Golf Digest. Okay, here is the summary...1) Clear your head and don't think of anything other than putting; 2) Believe you are a good putter because if you believe in yourself you will be a good putter. That's it gang. Take those concepts and wrap some lame stories around some pro golfers who used that technique and you've got 150 pages of the lightest, breeziest, contentless book you've ever read.Oh, it was funny to read the part about Davis Love and how he practices. According to the book Davis takes only one ball to the practice green and practices single puts to many locations. Well, wasn't I surprised to see Davis Love on the TV this weekend in the 2012 PGA Championship and guess what! He had two balls!"
5,What I needed,This is just what I needed to clear my head about putting. I have since lent it to two different people. Great book.
5,The Best $... You'll Spend On Your Game,"I subscribe to a bunch of golf magazines. I own and occasionally re-read many of the best-selling golf instructional books ever written, including Golf Is A Game of Confidence. Most are good for knocking 1-3 strokes off your game per round over the course of 6-9 months. But this tape, with its suggestions for a simpler pre-shot routine and mind-clearing suggestions has taken 3-5 strokes off my putting alone in just 2 months. I listened to it 10 times before even trying out the suggestions, just to make sure they were ingrained in my thinking. It has actually made putting fun for me, rather than an afterthought. His bottom line: we let far too many thoughts run through our mind when we play golf, especially when we putt. His simple drills will help to keep self-doubt off the putting green. Spend the $...."
2,"""mental game of golf""",This is all about the mental side of the golf game focusing on putting. It was easy to read and understand and perhaps it would have helped me more if I had read it again. Not my favorite golf book.
2,If you like drinking perfume tasting flowers,"I bought this cause it was organic and fair trade. I like just green tea, this is like ground up flowers and strong floral taste. I am so not a fan! Giving this 2 stars cause the flavor giving it 5 stars for being organic and fair trade"
3,Good reggae ... but not great,I like this CD but I've only played it a few times so it isn't exactly knowing me out. I'd listen to a few tracks before you buy. I didn't do that.
3,Glass is a little touchie,Works great but you have to be careful using and washing it. The glass is very thin and can break way to easy.
1,terrible at current time,john conlees early albums where excellent and he had a great voice however the current release he has lost his voice and sounds like an amateur. very dissapointed.
5,Captures the excitement of Conlee's live performance,"If you've been fortunate enough to see one of Mr. Conlee's live performances, you'll know that this recording captures all those attributes which make his music so enjoyable. He's a great live entertainer, and it's all here for you in one great recording."
4,Sharp Southern Satire,"Cookie's Fortune is a charming little slightly dark comedy about a gallery of quirky characters. Although the characters are primarily one-dimensional ""types,"" they are placed in a situation fraught with comic possibilities. The brilliantly amateur church play directed by prima donna Glenn Close is a great comic touch. Julianne Moore is great as the dim sister who knows more secrets than she's telling. A delightfully ridiculous slice of southern family and small town life."
1,love the movie but can't watch on my dvd,"I saw movie on Netflix and loved it so ordered it not knowing what Region 2 was. when I put in my dvd player, found out I couldn't view. Very, very upset. This is the first time I encountered region 2 and not too happy. Don't know why Amazon even sells this."
1,Not a good review,This DVD did NOT work at all. It would not play in any DVD player. I was very disappointed. Do not buy this product
4,A sweet film from an American master,"A necessary corrective to the female relative who at any cost must keep up appearances, this film by Mr Altman sees him in fine form exploring small town society in the Deep South. A humane, wise film, with great acting by all concerned and some great lines "" How do you know he didn't kill her?"" asks the District Attorney, ""We go fishing"" replies the Deputy Sherriff."
5,Stay the course of this gem,"Okay, we saw some people do some things, and saw diferent people doing different things, and, well, it's Robert Altman . . . And I apologized to my husband, who is NOT a film buff. Then the delicious connections appear, a fascinating small Southern town with characters who are real, not contrivances. Watch for the Willis-Cookie exchange, the mother-daughter-aunt exchange, see the sheriff's character evaluation. Marvelous cast filling interesting characters speaking interesting dialogue. And when you've viewed, watch it again for all the subtlities. Treat yourself! You're worth it!"
3,Coulda been much better,"3.5 starsI like Altman a lot on occasion (Player, Nashville, a few others), and not so much at times, like here. This could have been tighter, and despite nice turns from Close, Tyler et al, it's too stagey, and too close to its theatrical source to be a great movie.It got boring enough by halfway that I turned it off and watched the rest later.Altman is trying to be Faulkneresque but never quite gets there. This is the South via Hollywood, and misses the real grit and nastiness behind the lace curtains.Nice try, though."
4,Interesting Characters,"Looking for action & adventure? You won't find it here. But that's just fine with me. So many movies try to dazzle you with special effects and head-spinning chase scenes. I truly enjoy a good story from a movie.""Cookie's Fortune"" is a good story with interestingly quirky characters. Charles Dutton is outstanding as the good guy. After the movie was over, I found myself wanting to know more about the history of these characters.Some folks felt this movie was insulting to Southerners, but I felt that this story & these characters could have happened in any small town in America.It's not everyone's cup-of-tea, but if you like a good story and some quirky characters ... you should enjoy ""Cookie's Fortune."""
5,Wonderful Wonderful movie.....,Grab your nachos...snuggle up on the couch...cause you are in for a pleasantly great film. I love the fact that this movie was set in the south..and it was just so enjoyably funny. I am trying to think of one word that could describe this movie...and I can only think of 2: Warm & Funny If you like this movie you would like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
2,not altmans' usual...,"i have seen all of altman's other films and found them excellent..until now... there was some really good acting(glenn close playing her usual psycho!), patricia neal..who i was happily suprised to see.. and charles dutton was really good..liv tyler should take some more acting lessons and chris odonnell too... it was a hard story to get into to but i did like the ending, it was very appropriate... not a great movie, but okay...."
2,"""Quirky""","This movie was certainly different, quirky describes it best. It was a nice surprise to see Patricia Neal. Charles S. Dutton played his role well. Julianne Moore played a character that was hard to get attached to. Live Tyler did an excellent job with her role. The storyline was a little hard to hold onto. Not as interesting as I would have liked. It was different, for sure."
5,Altman has never been better,"Quite possibly the best film of Robert Altman's amazing career. The writing is wondeful, the acting by Glenn Close, Charles S. Dutton, Patricia Neal, and Jullianne Moore, is superb. Don't miss."
2,I don't think I gained anything from watching this movie,"I know a lot of people will think I didn't like this movie because I didn't ""get it,"" but I'm of the opinion that there's not much to get. I like quirky characters, unusual plots, offbeat humor, etc., but none of the above were particularly outstanding in this film. I didn't empathize with any of the characters. In fact, I think I wanted to slap nearly every one of them by the time the film was over. What a waste of my time. Avoid this one, it's a stinker."
1,Great if You Are Looking For A Nap!,"This had to be one of the most boring films I have seen in a long time. Slow-moving is fine in a film if there is something to catch the viewer's interest. Such was not the case here. The characters other than Willis and Cookie were completely annoying, and if this film was supposed to exemplify Southern Charm, then KEEP ME AWAY FROM THE SOUTH! The first 119 minutes were slow. The credits moved along nicely, however.The soundtrack was completely annoying. Unless you are a die-hard Robert Altman fan, stay away!"
5,What Family Really Means,"I bought this to replace a VHS and now I show it to a lot of folks who would never have considered picking this off the rack of a video store. I see myself as a champion of the notion ""we are all one family"", flawed though I may be. This serves as a great teaching tool. Glenn Close is brilliant as she comes apart in the movie. This is also, I think, the best performance Chris O'Donnell has done to this point in his career. And, who wouldn't want Charles S. Dutton is their family."
4,Better than Most,"I haven't seen this movie in while, but I remember it. I've seen ""B"" movies and this isn't one. A REAL B movie is Frogs. I like the Atomic Dog because he was so smart. My fav. part is when the women shoots him with a tranq. dart and he just looks at her as if to say,""I'm not an idiot"" then pulls the dart out."
5,A Timeless Classic,"This book is a classic. I have the book that my father received as a child in the 1930's. These poems are written for children and would be appropriate for any child, even those children (or adults) who don't think that a child would like poems. I have given this book as a baby gift and plan on giving it again to my niece when she has her baby.You cannot go wrong with this book. This is a book that will live on through many, many generations. If your child does not have this book, I encourage you to purchase it for them. You can't go wrong."
5,a wonderful book to have for your child,"pleasant to look through, tender pastel pictures, high quality paper, great verses by Stevenson that we loved. My daughter falls asleep while I read them to her. I bought a used item among ""like new"", it came in perfect condition as described."
5,Beautiful edition of a classic,"A Child's Garden of Verses has always been one of my favorite books, and over the years I've given dozens of copies of it as First Birthday presents to the new children in my life. This is the most beautiful edition I have ever seen of these beloved poems. The illustrations are wonderful! They're taken from numerous editions over the years, and they cover a variety of styles and time periods. I couldn't be happier with this book, and I can't wait for the opportunity to give it to more children who I hope will grow to love it as much as I do.The world is so full of a number of thingsI'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."
2,A Child's Garden of Verses,I ordered this edition because the review said it had beautiful color illustrations - This book is in black and white - there is no color and it's very small - only around 6 inches tall _ I am sending it back - how very misleading! This was supposed to be a gift - I am very disappointed!.
3,This is a must have book for the Children's library.,Stevenson is wonderful and the children's rhymes in this compilation are timeless. This should be on every parent's and grandparent's shelf
1,Puffin Classics edition is incomplete; buy another instead.,"(That ""one star"" is for this edition only.) The [1994?] Puffin Classics reissue of this title, which I purchased from Amazon last year, is incomplete. It omits the fourth and last verse of the poem ""Marching Song."" I don't know if there are any other omissions. So buy some other edition. And while you're at it, pick up a copy of three-time U.S. National Scottish Fiddling champion Bonnie Rideout's award-winning CD, titled ""Gimme Elbow Room,"" billed as a child's introduction to Scottish music, but charming and entertaining for all ages. Stevenson's verses, Mother Goose, and quite a few clever surprises. Also available here from Amazon is her ""Celtic Circles,"" the most beautiful album that I own. Buy it too! And ""A Scottish Christmas"" as well."
5,A GREAT ALBUM,"Madonna shows her great artistic talent on this album. It is her only true R&b record. The music is beautiful. Songs like ""Take a bow"", ""Bedtime Story"", and ""Forbiden love"" are truly master works."
5,Nice melody music,"I'm one of the people who like to listen many kind of music. Madonna is the one of my faverite singer, i like melody of her song a lot."
4,Great,"The CD came in good condition, just a crack on the cover, but thats okay. I love the album, but if you are searching to buy a Madonna album for the first time, skip this one. I like this album and all, but Bedtime Stories is definitely not her best album. Search for True Blue, Like a Prayer, Ray of Light, or Confessions on a Dance Floor. You wont regret getting those albums. :)"
3,A different sound,"Bedtime Stories has a different sound for Madonna. On this disc she worked with multiple R&B producers to create a slick album of various sounds. ""secret"" has a 70's urban funky feel to it. The spiritual undertones are hints of what was to come later in Ray of Light. ""don't stop"" is almost a dance anthem. The shake-your-booty lyrics and the beats are there, but, the glossy arrangement keeps it from being compelling. After ""secret"" It's my favorite song on this album and would have made a great single. The title track is phenomenal: Rich, complex and vague lyrics that you could interpet many ways. The bulk of the songs are ballads whose production is bland R&B. The songs are saved however by Madonna's heartfelt and sincere delivery."
4,Bedtime Stories,"This album, to me, just has a lot of warmth to it, if that makes any sense. Compare it to the cold, static sounds of ""American Life"", this album just flows beautifully. I remember buying this album when I was 11 years old, i played it non-stop! A lot of fans regard this as Madonna's r+b album. She recruited some of the most popular r+b producers of the time and experimented with more soulful sounds and hip-hop beats. This album was nominated for Pop album of the Year at the Grammy Awards. It's a really good album overall with a lot of strong songs. Anyway, check it out."
3,Not bad,"This isn't bad considering, i liked 'erotica' of her last album but then i bought this i became hooked to the r'n'b beats on human nature and secret. Take a bow is a peaceful number and bedtime stories is average and nothing more. The rest can be boring but this is much more intelligent and grown up."
3,AM I THE ONLY ONE WITH AN UPRIGHT MADONNA COVER?,"I swear I must be the only person with an upright Madonna on the cover, but it doesn't matter because I like it that way better. Anyway, I must say, this is Madonna's worst album, which still isn't bad since the best singer ever. With this album Madonna did what she always does, experiments with a new genre of music. This time it was R/B. It didn't turn out too good. Pretty good, but not Erotica. Bedtime Stories seems like it should have waited for Ray of Light, which shows its the best song on the album. This album had another problem, too much BASS!! And the last problem, one of the producers is a man I hate, BABYFACE. His screwups show a lot in this album, while Bjork saved his butt with Bedtime Stories. Anyway, pick it up if you like Madonna and R/B, or if you just like R/B."
3,I think this could have been better.,Some of the music on this c d should have been a little slower not so much bass. Some of her old music is very good to listen to.
4,What was I thinking?,"Some people have described this as Madonna's ""comeback"" album after the ""disappointment"" of theEroticaalbum. But, both albums sold about 2 million copies in the US, so they were just about equally successful. But, this album did produce the biggest hit of Madonna's career, ""Take a Bow"" (#1 for seven weeks). It also yielded the #3 hit ""Secret"". The other two single from the album, ""Bedtime Story"" and ""Human Nature"", became the first two singles by Madonna to fail to make the Top 40 since her first single (""Everybody""). This is a good album overall, and Madonna's fans should enjoy it."
2,"Inconsistent album, a dissapointment on the whole.","I don't know what I was expecting when I took this CD off the shelf. But this CD was definetly not it. What this record lacks is a really good fast song. The ballads go on and on, most of them love songs that get repitive and old. Here is where you will long for the girl power attitude of her earlier albums like Like a Prayer and True Blue. Only three songs on this album I would even think of calling them *dance songs*, Don't Stop, Survival, and Human Nature. However, these three were awesome and I found my feet tapping to the beat. But they can't compare to earlier songs like Borderline and Till Death Do Us Part. On the flip side however, the songs were well written and if your a fan of endless love ballads, I would reccomend this CD."
3,The worst of Madonna's albums for the 1990s....,"I really didn't care for this album too much. Once again, Madge teamed up with Shep Pettibone and even got Babyface into the act. She was trying so hard to fit into that RandB/electronica thing that was going on in the mid-90s, but it just isn't Madonna. Like I have said in other reviews, this is part of Madonna's major transition period. Like any of her other albums, there are some good tunes like SURVIVAL, SECRET, and I'D RATHER BE YOUR LOVER. But, I didn't think TAKE A BOW was all that....and BEDTIME STORIES is good and ahead of its when it came out as a single...but it got totally ignored for the most part...or at least it seemed that way. Madonna never does make a totally hideous album, nor can she seem to get it all just right. She was heading in the overall right direction....and her next albums were/and still are/ celebrated gems. If I had to pass over one album...it would be this one. You won't be missing much."
3,GOOD R&B STYLE ALBUM. Except for...,"The theme of this album is R&B. And once again, Madonna shines through and proves to us that she's capable of anything. But there's one exception. The entire album is of an R&B feel with the exception of the title track. Co-written by Bjork, the song itself is great. But Bjork is not R&B. The song ""Bedtime Story"" is not R&B at all. It's electronica, Bjork style. This song belongs on the ""Ray of Light"" album. ""Bedtime Story"" was a single. I heard it on the radio ONE time. And then it disappeared never to be heard again. Why? Because it's too weird for the general public. Bjork is not ""radio"" material. I can't stand the radio myself, but my question is why did Madonna put such an eccentric song which is clearly electronica, on an R&B album?"
2,Another mp3 download with NO quality control,"Bedtime Stories is one of my favorite Madonna albums..... but on this mp3 version, the song, ""Secret"", comes on in the middle of the first guitar chord (essentially mucking up the intro). WTF??? When are record companies going to do some quality control on their download releases? This is inexcusable. I'm done downloading crap quality edits, remasters, and the like. Wise up you greedy, stupid record companies!"
3,Bring bittersweet dreams,"""Erotica"" lite--crisp, cool, refreshing, almost filling. And how about that ""Human Nature?"" Way to stick it to the man, girl. And how about that photography?"
2,The shaky one,"Madonna could have been on top of her game in 1994. She should have swallowed her pride and opened her heart with Pat Leonard's help. Instead, this album sounds like trail mix tastes. A bunch of over-rated producers who were hip at the time(a real joke in retrospect!)were hired in a desperate attempt by record company execs to rescue Madge from the abyss that followed Erotica, Sex and Body of Evidence. Madonna's self-cofidence was shaken, but her vulnerability is polished and streamlined into weak,over-produced nonsense. Inside of Me is worth a listen, although it sounds similar to a couple of other ballads she has made over the years. Secret is the only real standout track, unless you thought Take A Bow was a great song! This is definitely only worth exploring after you have bought her other albums. Buy GHV2 if you just want the hits. Even Madge doesn't like this one."
2,Not the Best Stories Around,"Despite some interesting songs like ""Sanctuary"", ""Bedtime Stories"" or ""Secret"", this Madonna album is nothing to write home about. Presenting a mix of R&B/pop/soul, this effort fails to seduce and intrigue, being a listenable enough yet ultimately blah record at best. It`s more tolerable than ""Erotica"", though, but far worse than the subsequent and more innovative ""Ray of Light"", ""Music"" and ""American Life"". An average record from an uneven artist.Mostly filler material."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I have always admired Madonna's music and personality. But I have to admit that ""Bedtime Stories"" is her worst album since TRUE BLUE. Cheesy lyrics and boring tunes. In two words: commercial junk. Madonna betrays herself by forgetting what her music is all about. There's only one song that makes it through: Human Nature. The rest of the album should fall into oblivion."
3,"Too bad, Mo....","This is, in my opinion, one of Madonna's less-than-stellar albums. It's not a constructive whole like other albums like ""Like A Prayer"" or ""Erotica,"" but there are some good songs. You get awesome tracks in ""Human Nature,"" ""I'd Rather Be Your Lover,"" ""Sanctuary"" and the title-track that was co-written by Iceland diva Bjork, ""Bedtime Story."" But with the good, you get the bad. ""Survival,"" the terribly monotonous ""Secret"" (buy the maxi of Secret, way better), the way too perky ""Don't Stop"" the boring ""Inside of Me"" & ""Forbidden Love"" and the terribly over played ""Take A Bow"" are all basically album fillers if you ask me. This is good if only for Human Nature & Bedtime Story, but other than that, eh, take it or leave it."
2,Lacklustre Lazy Lullabies,"As an album, Bedtime Stories is insipid, uninspired, boring and a tedious aural exercise. I know the intention is to do some ballads, but Madge seems to drag her feet vocally and comes across as lackadaisical.Some tracks are pretty tuneless, think Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary. The album could do with some rigorous editing to whittle down the set to the really catchy ones. And release this as an EP.Two stars for the hits - Secret and Take A Bow. The latter produced by Whats-His-Face.If you do not own this, you may just want to get Celebration which contains these songs.Looking at the brighter side, Bedtime Stories is a great cure for insomnia!"
4,BEDTIME BUT NOT SLEEPING,"Bedtime Stories is another amazing album by Madonna! With a more r&b; feel to it, each song has a cool style, both sexy,and upbeat.Survival - nice song, not most popular, but fun to listen to.4/5Secret - most popular from this cd. Real R&B;, guitars and everything! 5/5I'd rather be your lover - ok song, better after listening to it overtime. Good bass 5/5Inside of me - sexy song, good bass again 5/5Don't stop - repetitive, but pretty good song 3/5Human Nature - well- known song, brings out a lot of r&b; 4/5Forbidden love - really a beautiful song, slower than others 4/5Love tried to welcome me - slow, but nice. A pretty song. Have to listen to it and give it a chance 4/5Sanctuary - slow, butvery sexy song, different from other songs 5/5Bedtime Stories - great song! fabulous video! Bjork wrote it I believe, if u can imagine what the style of the song is 5/5Take a bow - slow but really pretty song - Baby face sings in it too 4/5"
5,Storyteller: Madonna's best album of the '90's,"Forget the dreadful EROTICA, musical EVITA, or even the electronic RAY OF LIGHT, BEDTIME STORIES is Madonna's best album of the '90's. She proved in '94 that she too could do R&B, and do it well. BEDTIME STORIES is her most consistant and her most appealing album. It's filled with laid-back, smooth R&B grooves. Lyrically, Madonna sounds clearer than she's ever been. She's sings with smooth confidence, self-assurance, and even vulnerability. BEDTIME STORIES is also filled with creamy ballads. They're so smooth and sweet, you'll take a second look to see if it's really Madonna singing. Her smash hit ""take a bow"" and ""inside of me"" are perfect examples. The track ""bedtime story"" is also a nice surprise. It's a weird, techno track produced by Bjork. That song was the bridge to RAY OF LIGHT and set Madonna off into a new sound. BEDTIME STORIES is the perfect chill-out cd."
4,A Great CD,Bedtime Stories is a great album with a great beginning and end. The middle is lacking a bit with the exception of Human Nature. Not as good as her other CD's but still well worth the money.
5,One of Madonna's Best,"Madonna really did a great job with Bedtime Stories, many people said it was her worst work ever but I liked it very much. R&B is the flavour of the cd, with a bit of groove and techno. ""Bedtime Story"" is the album's best song...kind of her introduction to her Ray of Light album, with it's techno flavour. It has many emotions and is very creative. ""Human Nature"" is a great song also that she wrote about her critics. ""Secret"" is a cool song also. ""Take A Bow"" is one of Madonna's most beautiful songs. I highly reccomend this cd."
4,cool,"Like a slow sexy mutha Madonna expresses herself right into the ninties with this album. Once again she proves she's the drama queen of the ninties in""Take A bow"", queen of expression in ""Human Nature"", and best of all queen of the dance floor in ""Bedtime Story""."
5,Madonna and R&B,"A different Madonna album but aren't they all? Madonna explores her soulful side on this album and it works! No need for vocal acrobatics like other singers trying to prove something. She lets the music take care of that and sings with her heart.This is a more mellow Madonna. Her vulnerability peeks out in songs like ""Inside of Me"" and ""Love Tried to Welcome Me."" However, she turns that around and sticks it into the faces of her critic with her song ""Human Nature.""The hits ""Secret"" and ""Take a Bow"" make this album worth the value. The other songs on this album are great too. It brings me back memories of some of my fondest times: college. I hope this album can bring back memories for you or even create new memories for you to look back upon."
2,rather bland...,"like when every madonna album comes out, i rush to the store the day it comes out and immediately buy it. in this case, it was no different. but this time i think i only listened to it a few times after purchasing it. I felt that this album was pretty bland, almost too mellow for its own good. i don't think i could pick a 'worst' album, rather ir i could pick a 'boring' album...it would be BEDTIME STORIES. though there are some standout tracks...INSIDE OF ME, HUMAN NATURE and BEDTIME STORY."
2,"Eleven bedtime stories to listen to, but want to forget","I must say that 'Bedtime Stories' really wasn't THAT bad, but I was pretty disappointed in this album. I originally didn't want to buy this one, but I did, because I liked 'Bedtime Story', a track that would be more suitable for 1998's 'Ray of Light' instead, but it is also the best Madonna video ever. What I liked about 'Bedtime Stories' is the R&B/sort-of-dance beat to the songs, but what I didn't really like was the fact that it was...mabye a bit too mellowed. Still it wasn't that bad at all."
2,So So Album,"I ""LOVE"" all of Ms. Madonnas albums to the extreme with the exception of this one and Erotica. Although she sings great as she has always, the songs here leave something to be desired. With the exception of ""Take A Bow"", I don't listen to any of the other songs on this album. I'm glad she's back with ""Ray Of Light"", Her best studio album since ""Like A Prayer"". Go get one of those if you want some good Madonna music. Skip this one and Erotica."
2,Skip it,"This is Madonna at her best. Which is pretty sad, since most of it is about as substantial as cotton candy. I enjoyed some of the grooves, especially the later ones like ""Sanctuary"" and ""Bedtime Story"" the first few times I listened but tired quickly of the whole album. If you want synth-pop dance music, go buy something intelligent like Everything But The Girl's ""Walking Wounded."" It's quantum levels better than ""Bedtime Stories."" And if you're a young woman looking for a role model in a modern pop star, try Chrissie Hynde, Suzanne Vega or Joni Mitchell. Madonna is simply an offensive narcissist."
4,good CD,"while erotica as an album was all over the place, bedtime stories has more of a musical direction and has cooled down from all the hard thumping beats of erotica. I think this album is a nice romantic love album that gets one in the mood though it has its share of hip hop dancefloor tracks, r&b ballads and ballads with instrumental hooks."
4,Mixed,"You can always count on getting a great album with Madonna.She always delves into different styles, yet retaining the 'essence' of what makes her Madonna. This is her R&B / Soul moment (with a mix of electronica / pop)The same applies here, though in my opinion (and i am a HUGE fan of hers), this album contains some of her stongest, but also weakest moments.Lets get the weak tracks out of the way first: 'Survival', 'I'd rather be your lover',the single 'Human nature', and the pleasant song, 'Dont stop'.The remaining tracks are outstanding.The beautiful 'Take a bow', the haunting 'Love tried to welcome me' and moving and beautiful 'Inside of me'.As for the more upbeat moments, the fascinating 'Sanctuary', quoting the poems of Walt Whitman, and the Bjork penned title track.Despite its weaker moments, this is still a great album.Perhaps get Ray of Light / Music and Erotica first if you havent already, but dont by-pass this."
3,Very Good (at first...),"This a curious cd from Madonna. The first time you hear it you'd swear it was one of her best. Yet this cd simply doesn't live up to repeat listening. ""Secret"", ""Forbidden Love"" and ""Bedtime Story"" are the only songs that end up being worth your time in the end. The actual song ""Bedtime Story"" doesn't sound anything like the rest of the cd (which, in the end, turns out to be a plus) but I wonder why she didn't just save this track for her next cd ""Ray of Light"" (where it would have fit much better)? If you really want a good Madonna cd, skip this and pick up either ""Erotica"" or ""Ray of Light""."
5,Madonna's album Bedtime Stories is a 5 stars for me!!,"Hey everyone,i love madonna's ""Bedtime Stories"" album because it is very creative,and has like 3 different types of music,like a compi- lation.pop/dance/r&b.I think it is one of the coolest albums that i've listened to in a while"
5,One of the best CD's of all time,"R&B flavor with a hint of electronica. Once again Madonna was ahead of her time with this one. Eventhough, Madonna herself said that ""this was the hardest album to make"", the listener would never know it. Great, Great, Great!"
5,ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE ALBUMS!!!!,"This album is very personal. With songs like ""Love tried to welcome me in""(My personal favorite), and ""Survival""-Madonna bears her soul. On ""Human Nature"", Madonna gives her critics a chance to look at themselves-all the while backed by a hot track.... This is an album that you can listen to at anytime-Madonna fan or not.....It's a must buy!!!!!!!!"
5,Easily one of Madonna's finest work since Erotica.,"This album is one of my favorite Madonna albums. As a big big fan, I must have this in my CD player at all times! It has the best love songs (better than on Something To Remember) and the best lyrics (Take A Bow, Human Natre etc..). END"
3,"Good cd, but not exactly my type","After listening to this cd, I feel it is more R & B and electronica than anything. The songs are mostly mellow. The ones I truly like are ""Secret"" (one of Madonna's best songs), ""I'd rather be your lover"", ""Human Nature"", ""Take a bow"" and ""Bedtime Stories"" (truly unique song). What makes this album different from Like a Prayer is that I can listen to that cd entirely. This one, to me, only stands out in this tracks. Not a bad album, but could have been better."
5,chillin' r&b/hip hop masterpiece from madonna,top 5 bedtime stories picks:SecretHuman NatureTake a BowBedtime StoryDon't Stop
5,R&B Madonna!,"After the explicit ""Erotica"", everybody thought Madonna's career was over but she came back with ""Bedtime Stories"" to prove them wrong and reinvented herself again. With the help of Dallas Austin and Babyface, Madonna recorded a very classy and atmospheric R&B album. I love R&B/Hip-Hop and I usually dislike when Pop stars try to do that kind of music but I LOVE this album and it's my favourite Madonna album. Buy it.... you won't regret it."
5,"Beautiful, underrated album","Any apprehension I had about buying this album disappeared the minute I put it in my CD player. I've always LOVED ""Secret"" and ""Take A Bow"", and I wondered what the rest of the album held in store. I found the title to be very appropriate. The overall feeling is very soothing, from the grooves of ""Survival"" to the beat of ""Secret"". Nearly every song on this album is cohesive and well-written. ""Inside of Me"" (about Madonna's mother!) is a very pretty, sad song. ""Human Nature"" is even well integrated. I've always thought ""Bedtime Story"" was weird, but it fits when paired with ""Sanctuary"". The album closes with ""Take A Bow"", a beautiful song that is timeless, and understandably Madonna's biggest hit. If you are a Madonna fan and don't own this album, buy it now! You won't be dissapointed!"
5,LET MADDY TELL YOU A BEDTIME STORY,"THIS ALBUM IS SO COOL I LOVE IT.IT IS SO FUN TO LISTEN TO AND DANCE TO SHE IS REALLY THE BEST ARTIST OF TODAY AND I'M SURE SHE'S GOING TO BE HERE FOR A LONG,LONG TIME.DEFINATLY GREATEST WORK YET................."
4,Good,"I think this is the best Madonna album after Ray Of Light. I like the songs Secret, Human Nature, Bedtime Story and Take A Bow very much. I'd rather be your love, survival and Don't stop aren't very good but the rest are Ok."
1,Way too big - did not work,"I had ordered the Tadpoles set that came with one sheet, a blanket and cradle bumpers and was very happy. I decided I needed additional cradle sheets and ordered this item. The sheets were way too big! I actually wondered if I had ordered crib sheets in error but they were not that big. They were also kind of scratchy. It is weird that I ordered the same brand of sheets as the one I liked and these were of such different quality. Not good."
3,Wrong Picture!,"Please note, the picture they are showing for this item is incorrect! They are showing you the 7025-42 model, not the 7030-42 model."
3,[...],"[...] If you order this item, you will get a smaller, 2-battery model, not as deluxe as the pictured item, and with no stand."
1,"BonJour Turbo Latte, black",I did not get what I ordered. I was dissapointed that the picture was not the item that I received. I returned the item that I received. I will never buy any Item from BonJourn on the iternet.I bought the item at the store (a lot cheaper) and I love it.
1,Misleading,In this supposed best of WCW all you get isThe Best of Great Amrican BashThe Best of Bash at The beachThe Best of War Games The price is way too high for just 3 mediocre videos. You can eisily pick these up for 7.50 each at target or some other store. Skip purchase of this or you will be sorry.
5,Finally Found this!!,"Jan Akkerman is one of the most talented guitarists ever and this album is one of his best. I have a hard picking a favorite album as all of his music is exceptional. Best known for his work with the band Focus, which was an extraordinary band, he left and never looked back. His solo work has shown his versatility as an artist as Jan experiments with every genre of music including jazz, rock, fusion, progressive, classical, and blues. He crosses all the boundaries of music and blends it all together to make a masterpiece. I can listen to this album over and over and get lost in its different flavors. It's sad and melancholic in some songs, happy and joyful in others. I love the contrast that Jan relates in his music. There are few artists that I have to have everything they've ever recorded, but Jan Akkerman is one of those artists."
5,Excellent Disc By An Excellent Guitarist,You gotta love the cover! Great renditions of material spanning Akkerman's career.The 2 star reviewer is clueless. Enjoy it.
2,What!!?,"This cd starts with some great guitar work and then it goes down hill from there. This cd with the exception of the first song, is a snoozer."
2,Completely lacking in heart and soul,"I love Jan Akkerman's ealier ""Live"" album from the '70's (recorded in Montreux). That band was so tight, the music so unexpected and passionate.This release couldn't be more staid and dull.Sure, the playing is well rehearesed and tight. But the band plays with too much restraint and with too few moments of release. Most songs are mid-tempo or slower and never build up much steam. Disc 2 is better--more rocking blues , but still leaves me frustrated and a little bit bored. Almost nowhere do I sense the invention I expected or the improvisation promised by an earlier reviewer.It's nice to have the Focus material, but while it is faithful in its reproduction, it's sadly heartless in its execution.Overall, I guess I'm glad I own this. And it is growing on me. But I don't recommend it."
4,"Awesome DVD/CD, definitly a must for Evanescence Fans!","If you love Evanescence check out this DVD/CD!! You wont be too dissapointed!I love this DVD/CD a lot, and I enjoy watching the live concert and the behind-the-scenes stuff! Though, the life vocals of Amy Lee in the concert can be a bit of a let down if you just listen to the CD. If you buy it, you should really watch the live concert first to see why her voice sounds a bit weaker, I mean if you were jumping around like that on stage you'd get pretty weak vocals too! But I wouldn't say it's a waste of money like some people say, it's an awesome DVD and Evanescence should really be proud of their newest creation thus far!I'm definitly looking forward to more CDs by Evanescence!"
5,":o o.o 0.o Ect, Ect.","""Anywhere But Home"" is awesome. Its TWO discs-- One is a CD, the others a DVD -- and includes a FULL concert in Paris. I know what your thinking. 'Thats not so great, I've heard ALL the songs, I just want it for the music videos.' While the music videos ARE unbearably[Spl? Heh heh. Oops.]cool, the concert is superior. I mean, really, man, its so neat! First off, the lights are VERY awesome. Amy actually sounds really good live. Ya'know, the only people I really think are good live are her and Avril. Seether, of course as well....Off topic, Off topic. ANYWAYS, the piano on ""Thoughtless"" forces me to gape in happiness. Before my Delicious Spam-Inflicted rant is over, let me just say that the Behind the Scenes are funny as hell.Anyway, purchase the DVD or you will perish under the mighty hand of evil non-purchasing-music gods. I don't even know what I'm typing anymore. Ignore me.~Rev. MEAT~"
1,Disappointed!,"Shame on Amazon for not noting this was a live album in their product description. I was in a hurry and bought this album to close out my order and did it based on the song titles. Had they noted it was live, I would have ordered a different album. I'm disappointed in that now I'm going to have to scroll through all the screens to research every purchase because someone short-cutted it and put in a vague description."
2,Anywhere but home,"Major dissappointment! They had a terrible mixer, Miss Lee gets drowned out & guitarist is way to loud, screaming his lyrics when they should be a loud whisper."
5,Anywhere But Home DVD,"Awesome DVD. If you like Evanescence, you are going to love this concert video."
1,Who mixed this?,"This CD was poorly produced and mixed. It sounds like a bootlegged copy -- as it if were recorded by an audience member with a recorder tucked away in their trench coat. Or perhaps the lead singer's mic wasn't working and the audio was being picked up by mics by the drummer or the guitarist. I like Evanescence and their music -- but as a real audiophile, I was absolutely appalled and disturbed by the way this cd was mixed. It is very difficult to listen to and to enjoy. Very ""tinny"" and tough to hear the vocals. I've purchased well over 500 CD's in my lifetime, and this is one of only a very select handful that I feel I should be able to return."
2,Amy Lee's vocals lack power,"The the quality of the band's music is good and heavier than Fallen, but the footage is edited for an ADD MTV music video audience. Amy Lee's vocals don't sound as good live as her studio recordings. She sounds better on the softer songs, but during the heavy ones her vocals don't have enough presence. In addition, Amy Lee's stage posturing and dancing somewhat imitates Marilyn Manson, and is unattractive and unfeminine. I give the DVD 2 stars, but the CD, I give 4 stars."
2,It's the same thing!,"Excited to discover this ""new album"", I almost bought this. But, it's just the last album repackaged with a DVD!If you don't own the first album, this would be a good deal. However, if you already own the first album, be prepared to have just purchased the same songs!!"
1,live shriek is even worse!,"Think this band sucks, they suck even more live, bad misicanship, lame songs and horrible vocals."
1,I expected more...,"i read the reviews looking for a complaint like mine. My CD was a mess! The titles do not reflect the correct track. And ""Missing"" was listed, but not on my CD at all.I really loved ""Fallen"" and expected much more in this CDThis was the first time I have purchased a defective CD!"
2,Disappointing At Best,"I had been tempting myself to buy this CD for several weeks, and finally just yesterday I gave into the temptation. I thought that it might be rewarding considering there are a few songs that do not appear on the ""Fallen"" album, but the entire thing was somewhat of a disappointment. I usually enjoy watching concert footage, but this time it felt somewhat of a drag. However, this item is not going to be one I return, and all I've said may be influenced sheerly by mood. You may have a different experience than me, so I wish you the best. Happy Listening."
1,fire the production team now,"Great band, coulda been a great dvd concert, but it is ruined by whatever hacks they hired to produce it. Camera angles are freakin horrendous, the editing is not even first year film class garbage and whoever did the 5.1 mix should be fired and never allowed to work in the industry again. It's 2005. We shouldn't still be seeing craptacular production like this."
3,Music good; band's behavior a turn-off,"I enjoyed the live concert DVD, but was very disappointed in the behind the scenes bonus video -not because of any lack in DVD production quality, but because I discovered that I don't like any of the band members and their juvenile antics. Not only are their tattoos, piercings and hairstyles ugly to me, but I was not amused by the hotel room trashings, the moonings to the camera, and the overall silliness and immaturity. Some of the giggling and laughing seemed forced, as if they were trying to insist that they are having great fun behind the scenes, drinking and yelling and crawling on the floor, or dressing up in gorilla costumes. Ick.I really only bought this item because I LOVE ""My Immortal."""
5,Good energy and great music,"This dvd concert is awesome! The songs and band are full of energy, and the audio is great! The video editing like someone said can be a little crazy at times, but overall not that bad. The picture is really good! I would say if you love good energy concerts with mild moments too, then this is a great dvd concert to buy!!"
3,could be better,"Where to begin?---Let's see;the positive first:the videos are worth the price of the album. Evanescence is a great video band utilizing first rate directors and story ideas to match:very goth imagery.The live audio is okay if you are a big fan-although it appears Amy has studied the Rock and Roll cliche' handbook-by the numbers,banal and her between song banter appears scripted--they are a very young band hopefully with improvement room.The concert video is almost unwatchable with its cut back and forth editing--any aspiring directers take note on what not to do!! The backstage footage is okay but cliched as well."
4,Amy Lee Rocks!!!!!,I love just about any song by Evanescence and Amy Lee. There is something about her voice that captivates me. It's haunting & filled with emotion. And the band's sound brings it to it's fullest potential!
3,A sound music DVD,"This DVD is very good for the accompanying interviews and behind the scenes that come along with the concert. But that is it... I listen to the CD for the concert and watch the DVD for the extras, as I agree with most that it is poorly filmed. It is hard to watch to be honest, but there is nothing wrong with the actual music. I hesitated to buy this for a long time, as I was unsure if they could put together a decent concert with such limited material. I'm glad I bought it on sale as I don't think that it is worth paying full price for."
4,Very good for a live recording,I really enjoyed this CD. This is a great band with a bright hopefully LONG future.
2,Duped,"I love Evanescence, I saw that they had a new CD, I was dumb and rushed out to buy it. No new music, just live. Why didn't they put it on the front that it was live music, anything to try to make money off some duped fans! I am dissatisfied that I was not a more informed consumer. I really don't like the whole thing, more because it was not what I expected."
2,Terrible and lacking in performance,"this cd has been terribly recorded. Everything is on the same level and it just sounds flat. Amy needs to concentrate more on her performance and vocals rather than jumping around like an idiot. This cd lacks everything fallen has. But even over that, Origin was by far the greatest album they have come up with. Sad that they never even acknowledge it exists."
4,Evanescence for life!,"I did not know this was a concert album, silly me! But it was great and I enjoyed the music videos and the band being goofy behind the set."
4,CD/DVD Combos,"I wasn't sure how many stars to give this. I do give the live performance on the CD five stars. But the DVD performance of the setlist was horrible. I couldn't even finish it. The cuts annoyed me horribly and I could only get through one song. I don't what it is, but do the people today have that short attention span. I know for myself I can watch a band for about 2 hours. I'm 21 years old and I couldn't keep up with the cuts that the director decided to use.Anyway, I suggest just getting the CD of this combo off of a friend or iTunes. Amy Lee has an excellent voice live and has energy. I love this band and I can't wait to see them on the Family Values Tour this summer. At least I don't have to deal with the horrible editing."
3,a few new songs worthy of your attention!,"I got this cd a bit before it was released and i was impressed! Although most of thier live show is their same old stuff, they play a few new awesome songs like farther away and breathe no more (which totally pwned!) They did lose ben moody, but in the process they got terry balsamo from cold!!! (if you've even heard of cold u silly mainsteamers) terry's a great guitar player and he's a great fit in evanescence. These 2 new songs are a good sign that he will deliver all the goods and more that moody had done in ""Fallen"". Overall their new band members and few new songs are a rock solid live show. Whether your a mainstream listener or know most bands from a-z (like me) this cd is worthy of at least a few spins on your cd player...."
5,An unexpected delight,"When I first listed to the tracks, I was annoyed to find that they were all taken from a live performance in Paris. The crowd noise was initially distracting until I got comfortable with the fact that that ""noise"" added a distinct energy to the cd, that I now love. I'm glad they were bold enough to record almost the entire cd this way. I can't imagine it as all studio cuts. Bravo!!! It Rocks!"
5,Great DVD,"Yes, the video editing of the live convert could have been better. There was far too much flicking between camcera angles. However, it is still a great DVD/CD deal. Evanescence is still awesome, the bundled relase videos is a bonus. Finally in one place you can get all 4 of their videos. And if after watching this DVD, you are not a fan of Evanescence.... someone been planting the wrong flowers on your grave."
1,hard to watch,"I enjoy Evanescence; they do have some great songs. I'm interested in whether or not they can pull off another successful recording. I doubt it, but time will tell.The DVD is horrible. Quite seriously, if one is prone to seizures, you'll have one watching this performance. The editing never allows the viewer a chance to focus on the performance or the performers. I had to turn away numerous times just to prevent my brain from exploding.This DVD is more of a MTV video than a live concert. If the DVD was only the length of one song, I would have said, "" It was neat. Overdone, but fun."" But for all their songs, it just hurt.There are times the sound track is completely out of sync with the video.I own many live performances and this one is one of the worst."
2,save your money - skip this,"As a huge Evanescence fan, I was hoping to hear all the songs I love, Amy Lee's amazing voice, plus the energy of a live setting. This album bombs on all counts. She sounds terrible and is off key almost all the time. The instruments sound flat and are frequently inaudible. I would complain about the songs that were left off the cd, but considering how bad the ones they did play sound, maybe it's better they didn't further embarrass themselves. This cd is so bad I wish I could get a refund. Skip it and don't let the disgraceful versions of these songs cloud your memory of what the songs were meant to sound like."
1,Definately not the greatest,"Although I have only listened to the CD, I found this set to be a waste of money. Amy Lee's voice is far from being on key during the early tracks of the CD. Also, the CD was poorly recorded with the crowd screams often drowning out the song.The only part of this CD I found worthwhile was the studio track at the end, Missing. A very good song, but hardly able to justify the entire CD."
1,Way too much hype,"This is a good example of a trash band over hyped. Check out Nightwish, they do the same thing only better, every song on this cd has the same tempo with the same vocals. I am just giving this cd 1 star to lower the rating because the band/singer are that bad. Just like Linkin Park they will only re-release the same 1 or 2 cds for the rest of their career and try to milk them for all the money they are worth."
1,This Sucks,"First my sister buys the recorded crap, then she gets the same crap live with a cover so bad that I lost any and all respect I had for the band. The cover, Thoughtless by Korn, should be avoided at all costs. You are supposed to do covers because you respect a band, NOT because you want to kill everyone's eardrums! Unless you want the same crap you already payed for and a horrible cover, run away."
5,AWESOME,"Ok, this of course, like any other Evanescence cd, it the best. It shows just how awesome Amy Lee really is! She has a beautiful voice, she is talented, and she is funny, oh yeh and she is beautiful. The guys in the band know how to play some awesome music also. For the person who said Amy needs to lose about 50 lbs... you are crazy. Amy is beautiful, she is healthy, and she doesn't need to be stick thin to be that way. At least she doesn't prance around trying to be something she isn't. This is the greatest just like Evanescence"
3,Only buy it if you want the videos,"Look, I loved Fallen. If I want to hear these songs then I'll listen to that. Frankly they are not the greatest band when playing live. I love the band, but I say stick to the studio albums. I only bought this to have the videos from fallen. I'd suggest you do the same."
5,this is not good..,"This is not just good, this is amazing..I'm a big evanescence fan and all I can say is that this band is incredible live.you can see the passion, the love.. for all the people who say that they're fake.. and don't think.look at amy while she's playing my immortal at the piano and will understand and she's a good piano player.and please once again, don't say that amy has to lose weight..what the hell do you think? Is it so important?Is it more important than her voice?Althought there is the recorded base under some songs, the band play anyway..have you heard terry playing?he is just great..buy this cd to have great musicthe dvd is just fan watch the behind the scenes!"
2,thought i was having a siezure,"i couldnt wait for this to come out, seemed like they would be great live (whatever live means these days cause there is always a backing track running) i also hope they get some new material out soon. anyway i agree with the editing, it doesnt allow you to focus on anything throughout the concert, just when you can see something every trick in the book is used to ""edit"" this show. too bad, quite a let down, maybe some people used to this fast paced style wont mind, but hopefully after they get a few more albums done they can try this again."
4,kick-ass live,man.i was a big fan of the band when i got their original CD. this one doesnd do them justice. amy lee's voice is gorgeous. but i have yet to see the dvd. its pretty good. i dont normally go out and buy cds but this one is a must have if u are a fan of evanescence. =)
1,"Awful DVD, you will need a new pair of eyes",This band is very talented and it would have been a great DVD if only who ever produced this DVD tried to watch it himself. The cuts are very short and before you can focus on one scene it is gone. If this is your favorite band you don't get to see it! Compare it to falling down from a window trying to make out the people in the windows you are passing by.
2,Disappointing,Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Evanescence fan and I love Fallen. But Anywhere But Home was disappointing. It's actualy just a Live cd with only 2 new songs not on Fallen. The cd doesn't even say anywhere on it that it's a live cd with not really much new. I felt very cheated out of my money. PLus her voice isn't too great live. It's good I guess bc it's more raw ...but I much rather listen to Fallen over this anyday.
2,Very Bad Recording,"Evanescense is a very entertaining band live but this CD does not justify Evanescence live. Anywhere But Home has to be the worse live mainstream release I have ever heard. If anybody is a concert bootleg shopper, you could find better live shows. For this CD, there is way to much emphasis on the audience so you could barely hear Amy singing. The DVD isn't bad, its just not properly mixed. Watch evanescence at a real concert and you'll understand."
5,Good live performance,"There's my review for this package in a nutshell. Fallen is NOT Evanescence's debut cd. It's their ""major label debut"". A live album now makes perfect sense to me, they don't have Moody around anymore, so you have to expect some changes. This is a little sweetener while we wait for the next studio release. And it is sweet. 'Nuff said.P.S. Wanna know what's come before? Head to exodusevanescence.com"
5,i am a fan and this was worth buying!!!!,"recently seeing Amy Lee and the boys in concert, i had to have a live cd, and find out more about them.....i have loved there music since there 1st album and love it more now..this DVD was amazing to me, i liked every aspect of it, it showed behind the scenes and live conserts and videos....i enjoyed it very much, just like i did their consert....i wouldnt have it any other way.This is haunting music that is different in everyway, its like eveytime i listen to any of her songs, i am swept away to some sort of crazy/mixed up fairytale.....Buy this DVD, and enjoy Evanescence for yourself over and over in your own home....u have my word u will like it!!!!!"
5,Awesome,"i thought that this dvd was incredible. i would recommend it for any evanescence fan, or if youre looking for new music and dont know where to start...start here! truly amazing dvd set in the zenith in paris, and you get a look at the true evanescence behind their hardcore facade."
5,Amazing...,"This is truely the best live concert I've seen in my life. Amy Lee and the band are absolutely amazing onstage. Finally, a female performer who doesn't lipsync all of her songs! And as if the concert wasn't great enough, all the behind-the-scenes stuff is hilarious! I can honestly say I'm a bigger fan now than I was before seeing them live. This is definitely a must have for any Evanescence fan."
2,If only I could hear over all the screaming,"I was very let down by this album. I don't know who did the clean up on these songs but it stinks. You can certainly tell it's a live recording - half the time you can't even hear the band over the shrill screams of audience members. I own several other live albums and have not noticed this problem in them.For example, Sarah McLachlan's live album ""Mirrorball"". While there are some sounds from the audience at the beginings of the songs, you can actually HEAR the songs once they start. Not the case with this. At times you can't hear the band playing, others you can just bearly hear Amy Lee singing, and almost constantly is the shrill, annoying screams of the audience, which personally, I find very distracting.They should have done a bit more editing of this before putting it out. If you're trying to complete your Evanescence collection, this is probably something you'll want but as far as for the sheer entertainment for listening to, stick to ""Fallen""."
2,Annoying Live Music CD,"The only reason I bought this CD is because I didn't realize that it is a concert CD. I detest concert CDs because, as another reviewer stated, all the cheering is really annoying, and I especially dislike it when lead singers stop singing so the crowd can fill in....which happens here. There was nothing on the CD jacket indicating that it was a concert recording, which is ALSO annoying, and now I have wasted my money. I love Evanescence, but not this particular recording."
3,"Awesome band, awesome performance, shoot the cameraman","I've been wanting to see what Evanescence was like as a live act ever since the first cd, and eagerly purchased Anywhere But Home. After the first 5 minutes, I realized that (1) I HAD to see them in concert someday(2) Amy Lee is a spellbinding perfomer, & (3) I wanted to strangle the cameraman. Just where did this guy come from? He/She apparently thinks that the MTV-style of videos works well for a live concert. I'm still recovering from the migraine that watching this machine gun-like camerawork gave me. Take some classes, man!"
2,"Yea, but...","I was quite eager to pick this little guy up when I first heard it had been released. I'm a huge fan of the band, as they are one of the first female fronted Goth bands to do well... ever!But the editing killed me. I can't watch it. Imagine if you will the Blare Witch done at 3000 mph with a fancier zoom lens. There has got to be about a million cuts per minute and no way to get a sense of what's going on.I truly love to watch a band play live, but this is too much like trying to see a coked out fly through a dirty water glass.I would have been okay with maybe the first song or two being like that to induce a felling of excitement. But when it doesn't end and they're playing a slower song with the camera jumping about like a speed freak toad, I just have to leave the room.Whoever made this did not have art in mind.But it does beg the question: if this is what they're churning out, what does that say about our kid's attention spans?"
1,I'm so dizzy my head is spinning,"Dizzy, I'm so dizzy my head is spinningLike a whirlpool it never endsAnd it's You girl makin' it spinYou're making me dizzy"
3,Camera mooves too fast,its a great dvd but i've seen alot better camera movement in evanescence concerts on the net. I wouldn't recomend this dvd to someone who gets headaches from fast moving flashy things
2,Not as good as 'Fallen',Fallen is an incredible album. But why a live album already? I couldn't get into it.
3,"catchy music, unoriginal band","As much as the fans hate to hear this, it's the truth: Evanescence isn't a good band. They're mediocore musicians, and I feel that their only saving grace is Amy Lee's voice. I bought this cd a while ago, when I was still a teeny, and I was even disappointed then.It only has three ""previously unreleased"" songs, which are easily downloaded for a lot less.If you really want to buy a cd, see Lacuna Coil.Anyone with half a mind can see that Evanescence stole from them."
1,Live version CD.,All of these songs are Live. Not recorded in the studio. I am not happy. I'll go buy this CD from itunes.
3,Some Things Don't Get Better With Time,"I'm glad CB w/Lydia Pense is back recording / touring, but something seems missing. I think I miss the ""soulfulness"" of her sound, that just doesn't seem to be there anymore. She sounds too husky now (age I guess)."
3,"Nice seat, wrong hinges",I have the same complaint as Pam. I ordered this seat with nickel hinges and received brass. The seat is fine and arrived promptly. So it appears that if one desires something other than brass be prepared to be disappointed.
4,Review of Natural Reflections Wood Veneer Toilet Seat,Seat is as described. It is good value for the money and looks good.Completely satisfied. Delivery was quick.
5,Great quality but slow shipping on,"I would recommend this book to almost anyone who wants a good read. The stories are short enough that you can read in one sitting but understanding them can take a while. Unfortunatley, I ordered it as a textbook but it came too late for the class so I had to go out and get a more expensive version. The actual product that came was still in great condition meriting 5 stars but I didn't need it, so I had to return it."
2,"Lovely, but not comfy","This does look quite pretty on. However, the heavily textured embroidery is raised & ridged, & that is what is sitting next to your skin, as it is unlined. The cup runs a bit small (compared to say, the Whimsy) & also gives an odd, flattened shape due to the vertical seams."
2,"predictable, but a good start","The dictum ""show, don't tell"" should have been observed by the authors of this text. While some of the adventures are interesting, some of the writing is dull and pointless. This is often the case with books written by committee. Despite the talent associated with this tome, the story is trite (especially in the so-called New Testament) and the ending predictable. It is, however, open for sequel (see Koran and Book of Mormom), which this reviewer sees as a shameless marketing ploy. Using a little independent thought would probably help most individuals through life, not reliance on this book. Nevertheless, many people live by philosophies within this piece (some people live by the film ""Titanic""--there is no accounting for taste), so a word of caution to them--it's only a book."
3,"A few interesting demos, not well thought out or edited.","I'm being generous with the 3 stars here. I didn't dislike it, but there is a bunch to be desired.Jim Clark Jr. is a top notch practical Three Gun competitor and this DVD/video gives some of his thoughts on working the practical/action shotgun. The ""combat"" in the title is a bit of a misnomer (even though the techniques are very similar) but only a fool would be confused by that given the fact that Mr. Clark, a prominent competition shooter, is the host.The real weakness here is the descriptions are erratic. No standards or any approach to practice/training is really offered. Some of the shooting demos are interesting and Clark is clearly a talented action shotgunner but the much of the video is a camera man chasing him hand held."
5,Celine moves over for Winifred!,"What a voice! Versatile! Sensual! Winifred's voice seems adaptable to all genres, as the collection covers a variety of song types. YOU ARE MY ROSE, her own title song is compelling. My personal favorite is I Hate the Rain--it highlights a vibrant, brooding, blues quality! A ""MUST HAVE""!"
5,You Are My Rose,"The compassion in Winifred's voice brought tears to my eyes. Beautiful lyrics and a captivating voice. A CD I will enjoy listening to again and again. I would love to hear the French song sung in English as the words are so powerful; however, the French language is very condusive for a love song and beautifully executed. The picture of Winifred with the Tiger is amazing! Was that a real tiger? Hope to hear you on the radio and in concert soon."
3,food for thought,"I found this work interesting and thought provoking. The information provided opened a window on a little explored area of frontier life.Now while I do not believe all frontiersman were what we would not term Gay, the author does do alot to explore the homosocial sub-culture of their world and the ethos that supported it.To the extant that it focused on some bits of information too much and others to little;I think it falls within the usual range of error that all books written for a niche audience."
3,"Cute 90s house/pop/soul - if you like Steve Hurley, get this","Produced by the likes of JAMIE PRINCIPLE, STEVE SILK HURLEY, AND E-SMOOVE, this is Jamie's debut, very much in the vein of KYM SIMS - imagine Hurley's trademark earlt 90s pop-house remix style with Paul Abdul on vocals. Slight, but has its charms if you remember ""how we used to do it."""
1,bad,"Dudes a bum, he just mooches off people. Dumb movie and waste of money. I hate you craigslist joe. s"
3,"Novel Idea, needs better execution",The concept of this movie really peaked my interest. However I feel that it fell flat in various parts where things simply happened. Would have liked to see more meaning in it. Still worth checking out and my respect for the concept.
5,Excellent Movie,"Great movie, would love to watch it again and share with your friends.There are a few parts of the movie that are very moving."
5,Surprisingly Uplifting! :),"Surprisingly an amazing documentary to remind us all the good that we still have in the world from Joe's cross country road trip and back, with only a phone, laptop, clothes on his back, and backpack. Definitely a must see!"
4,"""there is light in the dark, and dark in the light""",A rental that is certainly worth a look if you are interested in craigslist or some of the many ways the internet is transforming society. Joe meets his videographer on craigslist and then proceeds to circumnavigate North America eating and sleeping at the behest of the virtual world. He meets a wonderful variety of people (including the website's founder) and seems a genuinely open and non-judgmental person. A courageous and inspiring undertaking.
5,Truly Inspirational,"A great example of how taking a chance, no matter how big or small, can change everything. Maybe even change your life."
5,Faith in the 21st century,"This book has been greatly helpful for me to understand the current state of affairs in the church. I have lived in many other countries in my adult life and ""coming home"" has not been easy. Despite the book's focus on the USA context, it is also an immensely appropriate resource for reflecting on our context in Canada. The book's thesis that the church has been caught up so seductively in all aspects of a ""consumer"" culture that we approach our faith and religious experience with the same value system is powerful and deeply sobering. While ""easy-reading"" the book is not an ""easy read"" since its premise demands that we refocus our lives on our call to be a community living out God's vision for hope and grace and justice in the world."
4,A Must Read,"If you are a music lover, industry hopeful, or history buff, this book will give you an honest, down to earth, fireside story of one very important man's life in the business. The manner in which he chooses to tell his story is an in depth, straight forward approach which keeps you wanting to continue to the next chapter. When it is all said and done, you feel as if you knew Wex throughout his journey and understand his joy in the career path he chose and just what he has accomplished. As a music business student, this was an inspiring, thought provoking read. Find this book, and enjoy."
4,Pretty good but could have moved a little faster.,The story was good but the plot dragged on. You knew who the bad guy was from the beginning and the good guy didn't move fast enough
4,Excellent buy for the price,"I just purchased this computer, although I paid more than the Amazon price, but couldn't be happier with it. My previous computer was 6 yrs. old and it was past time to replace it. So far I've no problems with Vista and the graphics are awesome, the processor is also much faster than my old one, naturally as I had a Pentium III in the old computer. The memory is the same as I'd upgraded the old one approx. 1 year ago. I'm still ""playing"" with it to see what I'm able to do but so far am VERY impressed with the Windows Photo Gallery that comes with Vista. I can edit my pictures with one program whereas before I had to use 2-3 programs. I also really like the fact that it has slots for memory cards on the front making it so much easier to import my pictures with my SD card. I paid $479.00 for mine so Amazon's price is a real bargain and I'd recommend this to anyone searching for a new computer that is also prepared for the new look of Vista."
3,Unconditional Love - Lovesongs,"To whom this may concern; This movie carried a wonderful storyline that was a little different than the norm. The most interesting thing to me was the music in the movie. I have been unable to find the titles of the songs in the movie. The ones that I am interested in is 'Golden Girl of my Dreams' sang by I did not catch the name and I have searched, please help me, and ""Deeper"" by also I could not see. I am desperate to get these songs. Will someone please help, thanks."
4,nice look,Although it is a simulated finish the look is elegent and so far seems well built. Much nicer look than the solid oak seat with brass hardware. The darker color gives a better contrast to our beige toilet. My one fear is the finish will chip. The first one we orderd came chipped. obviously dropped in shipping as the tip of the seat was dented. fortunately returns on Amazon are so painless I have no fear of trying something to see if I like it. I will update this review if it does chip down the road.
3,Nice but...,A really nice to look at seat that will NOT wear well. This seat is a laminate IMPORT product and chips easy. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,bad business,I ordered 4 of these. 2 of them came and were perfect in color and quality. the second two were complete garbage. both were broken at the hinges and one of the seats was cracked down the center in the front. the box wasnt messed up so I think the company that shipped them were idiots and should look for a job at mcdonalds.
1,Poor quality seat,I was so disappointed in this product1.not real cherrywood just has a thin stain2.rusted at the hinges and fell apart in a short period of timeI will never buy a toilet seat online again
2,Arrived Damaged,"The seat was smashed on the lid side and seat side. I bought this as a direct replacement. The hinges had broken on my original seat. Rather than returning and waiting, I swapped the hinges. The reason the hinges always break on these seats is that the pins are made out of plastic. If they would upgrade the hinges and ship these more safely, I would rate it a 5."
2,It does crack/split,"I have bought 2 toilet seats from Mayfair, both times the ""natural wood"" elongated cherry series. It states in the description that is does not crack or split, but that statement is simply NOT true. Both of the toilet seats have cracked after a few months of use. Very frustrating. I do like the look although it is not natural wood. I think they need to revamp their description of this item."
3,Not the Best Quality,"I really like the seat, especially the brushed-nickel hinges. But, the seat itself has several run spots, touch up spots, nicks, etc. The quality control is definitely lacking, at least on my purchase."
3,confused,"If you looking for your typical performance on dvd you'll be disappointed, the structure of this dvd is very confusing, the menu on the cover is wrong and the menus are hard to navigate, the performances are amazing though, the audio quality is good,"
3,this is a little book - and very old,"This little book (almost 100 pages) was first published in 1922, and with some interresting photographs. It is drawn from the author's experiences and research while living in China, with lots of illustrations, newspaper clippings, and anecdotes.Chapters:1. The Place of the Dragon in Chinese Life2. How the Dragon Idea Originated3. The Varities of Dragons4. What Dragons Really Look like5. People Who Have Seen Dragons6. The Dragon in Western Mythology7. Quaint Beliefs About the Dragon8. How Dragons Controll the Fortunes of Men9. The Hold of the Dragon on ChinaThere are many more modern books out there. This would probably be more of interrest to a researcher."
4,I am the Clay good but not perfect,"I enjoyed it thoroughly and would give it an 8 of 10 or four stars ****. I liked how the story was told in three points of view and how it went into detail. At the beginning the story was a little boring because it was over descriptive and there wasn't any action or conversation, but at the middle and the end it became more of a story than a description. Another problem was at the beginning of the story, the characters weren't introduced yet and the perspectives switched about every three paragraphs so I didn't know who was thinking and it confused me. I would recommend it to anyone in high school or older. When the boy was emotional the sentences would be run-ons, which I had mixed feelings about because they were run-ons but they conveyed his feelings better than a regular sentence ever could. It wasn't the best book I've ever read but it's up there."
1,Very Disappointing....,"I am an avid reader and liked/loved every book I ever read by Chaim Potok well until now. Sorry to say that this book was dragging and there were so many repetitions throughout the book that it got underneath my skin. It's one thing to write in detail (which I do enjoy) and it's another to make the reader feel like the writer has nothing to say therefore ""lets stretch this out"".This was one of the very few books that I could not even finnish reading. I read about 3/4 of it and I had to put it down.The story line was interesting and the book would've been enjoyable only if....."
2,not chaim's greatest work,"this is definitely not one of Chaim's greater works of art. If you are expecting the type of work you got in ""The Chosen"" then you will be dissappointed. The plot is very slow developing and is not very interesting, it seems that nothing of importance happened in the novel from beginning to end, and you dont establish a connection with any of the characters like you did in his previous works. This book is not worth reading unless you are a fan of Chaim Potok."
2,Boring As Clay,"I Am The Clay is a story of suffering and civilians caught in the crossfire of the Korean War. However, I believed the story was repetitive and predictable. It was mainly told from the perspective of an old man. Much of the narration is in fragmented sentences, in which the characters' emotions are poorly articulated. A big portion of the story involves the old man stating his disapproval of his wife's obstinacy. The old couple abandons their home, finds a child, makes it to a refugee camp, and comes back home. The events have no effect on their perspective of each other or life.I found the beliefs of the characters of I Am The Clay to be interesting. They believed in spirits that protect them, despite the hardships they had been through.I preferred The Chosen, the author's previous book; the characters of that book articulate more than their most superficial feelings."
5,triumph of the human spirit,"An old Korean couple flees their village as invaders come from the north. Potok knows the glory and seaminess of human nature, and he gives it to us in his spare prose. These are scenes we know: the tension between a childless couple: ""Woman, you are a roaring in my ears."" Superstitious beliefs, exposed when the old woman saves a dying child who later saves them. Exploitation: in the refugee camp and later in the old couple's village, the old man is out for himself and yet has a certain affection for his woman. She is captured from time to time humming the tune, ""Have thine own way, Lord, Have thine own way."" She represents the glory possible when the clay submits to the potter."
4,First hand account.,"I thought the chance to read an account of the civil war that not only came from a southerner but one who actually saw/participated would be pretty interesting. I was right. If you've watched the Blue and the Grey and North and South on television... those are movies, not the real thing. This book actually describes the politics, the social aspect and the battles of the civil war from a first hand view. At times it was a bit dry... I've read histories by much better story tellers, but you really have to give some credit for reading the account of someone who was actually there and experienced it."
4,Desert Gold,I would recommend this book for everyone above maybe the age of fourteen or so.It is a western romance woven in a way that brings the landscape to life and gives a feel to the story that is I believe is a lost art.
3,My Thoughts,"I enjoyed this book, but I did find some of his writing style hard to read. But it was still a good story."
5,Desert Gold,Enjoyed reading this book. I would like to have more of this kind by different authors. Would recommend this for all ages.
2,Desert Blah,"I usually like Zane Grey, got this one as a mini-book club read with elderly Aunt to discuss.. She read hard cover and also didn't finish. Plot dragged, where there was a story at all. Characters were boring. I have read a lot of Zane and tho a little old fashioned, enjoyed them. This left a lot to be desired. Sorry Zane. Ay least it was a freebie on Amazon for Kindle."
3,Might've,"Some glimpses of the brilliant comic do come out in the movie, but just not enough to make this big budget special effects show a winner. Reeves does a fair job, but he does not blow you away. The story which is basically about the battle between heaven and hell and a man caught between the two is interesting. A lot of possibilities, but just not enough hits the mark to make this one I can recommend."
5,Human being instruction manual,"If you have questions about the world, universe, and why things are the way they are, you should read this book.I am usually a very fast reader, but this book slowed me down considerably. I found myself reading each paragraph several times just to let it sink in. Then I would have aha moments as to what that information means to other things in life. Having a dictionary close would be helpful because many of the words are rather large. You also need to start at Book I."
3,Tough to rate these books.,I'm not to proud to say that they are a very tough read for me. Plus you have to take a leap of faith in believing the material because the information is channeled. These are a case study series so you can bite off as much as you can handle at a time. In most cases I don't follow the Authors line of questioning. I do like it and believe I am geeting something from the them. Not something I would recomend if you are looking for something fun to read.
4,Good for Intro purposes,"The Law of One Series is a good introduction to the concepts of Service to Self/Service to Others and higher densities of Reality - but only as a precursor or supplement to the more accurate, in-depth, and researched work of Laura Knight. If you order these, be sure to get Knight's Wave Series books - or, better yet, go straight to the Wave Series."
3,Hasn't caught anything in over a year,Maybe the regular victor traps are getting them all before this has a chance. This thing is still catch free. The standard bait and kill trap work and I am happy with that. The original hunk of peanut butter is still in it.
5,The best mouse trap!,"This really is the best mouse trap! It is always set, I've caught up to three mice in the same trap overnight. And it's safe! If you have little children or pets around you don't have to worry about them getting hurt by one of those spring-loaded traps.When you catch a mouse you can release it live or wait for it to die them dispose of it. Clean the trap and you're ready to go again.It says ""no bait required."" I seem to have better success with a little dog food for bait.I bought two and if I had to buy another trap, this would be the only one for me!"
2,Didn't work for me.,"I bought this trap along with the Havahart double door trap for mice. Tried baited and un-baited. The other trap caught the tiniest mice consistently, this one still hasn't caught a single mouse, even when placed in the same place as the other trap. It may be slightly more involved to set but the Havahart mouse trap works very well."
2,Doesnt work to well,I had this for a long while i think over a year. It rarely works for me adult mice will not enter it. On a rare occasion a baby mice will get trapped in it. Im guessing recent nest Departees. These mice are usually about size of my Pinky .This would be acceptable if was more frequent. However this far and few in between. I have tried water an different baits and locations.
3,No bait - no mice,"So I bought this trap figuring it would be nice to release the mice that keep getting in our utility closet, and into the walls. We live in the country so there are lots of mice. I had caught 7 mice in the week prior to getting the trap. I retired the snap traps and after 2 weeks, no mice. I baited it with peanut butter, the mice managed to get the bait out through the slots in the side - no mice. So I gooped it up where they couldn't get it and put a couple drops on the ramps. I caught one mouse and set him free but his buddies weren't so lucky. I reset the snap traps and caught 3 more then next night. Obviously there are mice in there but they want nothing to do with this trap. Maybe a different bait would work better but peanut butter always works with snap traps. I have another one in the attic where there was activity, no bait, no mice after 3 weeks."
2,Mice escape,"It caught a few mice at first, but now I just keep finding droppings inside the trap and no mice. Amazingly, they seem to have figured it out."
4,Caught 3 mice within hours of placement,"It's doing the job it's supposed to do, and quickly! The problem I have is the way the top opens like the lid of a chest -- it seems there's no way to get a controlled exit of mice from the trap. (I'm a little freaked out by the idea of the little buggers jumping on me on their way out.) It would be better (for me at least) if there was a sliding-door-type opening. I could put a box against the door opening and just slide the door open and tap or shake until the mice fall into the box.Edit: this trap totally rocks. Caught 9 more mice overnight. The chicken food is safer without mice crawling all over it!"
3,Medium good,"I have used it baited with almonds and baited with dry dog food. The dry dog food seems to work better. Mice eventually go inside, but they are not as attracted to it as an old-fashioned Victor spring trap baited with a slice of almond. However, it does not require the attention that a spring trap requires."
5,"Fast, clean, and perfect",I choose to expedite this order because it was needed for a class. I got it within 2 business days. It was noted to have some water damage. The damage was very minimal and the book looked almost new. Everyone in my class who bought the book from the school's bookstore was still waiting on it. I was pleased with myself because not only did I have my book I paid 50% less than they did.
2,Not a Good Choice For Boys,"I bought this potty seat thinking it was perfect, as it has no special effects that would distract my son. Unfortunately, the pee guard just isn't tall enough and the couple of times he's actually used the potty, the pee has ended up all over the floor. This would have been a great potty for a girl, but I'd discourage buying this for a boy."
5,Loved the potty!,"I thought this potty was pretty durable and since it looked like the ""adult"" potty my son was pretty excited using it. Though he was potty trained pretty soon after buying this we still use this as a stool. I would definitely recommend this potty."
3,okay for girls but worthless for boys..,"my daughter used this seat itwas great for her,but i cant imagine my son using it without peeing all over"
1,What a waste of money!!,This book is a waste of money... just a compilation of a bunch of home remedies and wise tales. What a bunch of BS... It was one hour after I received it and I was angry that I had paid for this book??Please don't waste your money...
2,Air Rifle,"This rifle is very heavy, over 7 lbs. It feels like an AK47 with a different barrel. Barrel pump is difficult to use. Loading one pellet at a time is cumbersome. BBs work but will roll out of the barrel if the barrel is not kept pointed up. Accuracy, who knows, I bought it for crows but never hit one."
5,Greed & Hidden Truths of Cancer Cures,"By viewing Hoxsey I learned a very important lesson and that is that there are those who really care about you but it is not in the present so called ""money motivated health care system"" we have in place today. There are very simple remedies out there in which we are not being told about because there is no money to be made in herbal medicine as there is in prescription drugs. The Harry Hoxseys of today are still out there but we are taught from an early age that we should put all our trust in modern medicine and that this is the only way. By viewing this documentary of a wonderful human being who cared and loved his fellow man you will also see that there are other ways we can help ourselves besides running off to a medical doctor every time we come down with an illness. I very highly recommend that if you have any health problems at all that you view this video. May this open your eyes up to the simple things in life."
4,The Elvenbane,It took me a total of 5 hours to read this book. That is how engrossed I was in the story line!! It has wonderful magics and a world that draws you into the story line as surely as if you were Lashana. The world of magic and mystical creatures has always been a fascination for me and this book certainly left no disappointment!!
4,It was an intense book!,"I really loved this book. The ending was not quite as happy as I thought it would be, but the book was still excellent. I recommend any of Lackey's books she is an excellent writer."
4,This book got me interested in the Fantasy genre,"I like this book, and loved it when I was younger, but as I have matured, so have my tastes. So... It's interesting, but not the best book. If you want to read a really good book of the same type of story (girl raised by dragons), check out ""Daughter of Dragons"" by Kathleen H. Nelson. I think it covers the human/dragon culture clash better. Would a girl raised by dragons really fit in that well into human culture?"
2,Not Worth Reading,"I've read a few novels by Mercedes Lackey that I enjoyed, but this definitely isn't one of them. The pacing of the book is very slow for the first 90% of it (then the end comes in a rush). The characters are developed reasonably well, but their interactions are trite and uninteresting. The twists on high fantasy stereotypes are interesting, and I thought that might bode well for an interesting story, but unfortunately the story is typical fantasy and the ending is downright banal. I won't be reading any of the other books in the series."
1,blech.,"The only thing I have to say on the subject of this book is that the switching back and forth between author's styles (Lackey/Norton) was distracting enough to detract from what was otherwise a very good story, but if you can ignore being slapped in the face by the switching, you'll probably enjoy the book"
1,Poorly Constructed Tale,"Interesting characters, poorly constructed plot. The story jumps all over the place and leaves many plot-threads. There are entire episodes that are completely unnecessary to the story (like the visit to the Elven Lady Triana, the ""handfasting"" with Mero) and neither introduce important characters or move the story forward. Interesting ideas, but these authors needed some severe editing and re-writing, because the story reads like a first draft.However, the second book (Elvenblood), is much better."
2,Overrated Fantasy Novel,"First, I'd like to say that I am a big fan of both Andre Norton and Mercedes Lackey. That said, this isn't one of their better works. I picked this up for reading over vacation as I had seen the book in print for a number of years and thought I would give it a try. My problem with the book, is that the characters aren't very engaging. I've only read this first of 3 (4?) books, and I doubt I will continue simply because I found that I do not care about the well being of the heroes or the destruction of the villans. This is definitely a ""light reading"" novel."
3,Awesome narration of the audiobook,"This review is of the audiobook version that is available via audible, although the CD version appears to have the same narrator and may be the same edition.3 stars for the story, but 5 for the narrationReviews of the story are plentiful, but it is very rare when someone bothers to rate the narrator. I want to do so because I was amazed at the skill of Aasne Vigesaa, and I've been listening to audiobooks for a while now. She makes the story come alive- characters all have distinct voices, tones, and inflections, which is no mean feat considering the number of characters in this story. Accents appear when warranted. When a character talks with a mouth full or has a cold, the voice changes to reflect this. I was never at a loss for who was speaking what, and the voices she chose fit each character's personality flawlessly.It was an absolute pleasure listening to this narration, and I hope to hear more from this narrator in the future."
5,shiny things,"this ep is just a little taste of what these guys are up to. the opening track is an explosion of ear candy that makes you smile the whole time its playing (and for a while afterwards as well). and it just keeps going through till the end, the only comlaint in my head is that it is only an ep, it seems to end too soon for my appetite, but what are you going to do. buy this cd and love it."
4,LotsaBolero!,"The world is divided into those of us who love Bolero and those who don't. I love it and enjoy the various versions. At first I didn't like the foxtrot, but it grows on you."
3,Bolero to the point of obsession - but the disc has been subsequently reissued with a substantial bonus,"Potential buyers, be aware that this 2000 CD has been subsequently reissued (in 2004), shorn of one of its ""standard"" versions (the one by Serge Koussevitzky conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1930) but with the substantial addition of a version for clarinet and ""swing"" jazz combo by Benny Goodman from 1939, licensed from Sony. It makes the reissue, in my opinion, more appealing, with its opening and closing tracks devoted to two very contrasting takes on the standard version (Munch in 1956 and Mata in 1980) and its 8 other tracks devoted to the transcriptions, including the new and very entertaining Goodman. Hence my three (rather than four) stars for this one. See my review ofRavel's Greatest Hit: The Ultimate Bolero."
3,Sex & Love,"I realize this speaker is talking to high school student so she often uses humor and voices to reach out. When you get past that, she has some very valuable insight and thought provoking information regarding teenagers and the pressures to be sexual. She is coming from a Christian perspective but her message provides good advice for all teenagers."
5,Rants of a madman,"Mr Rankin is without any doubt insane and I think he would agree if he could escape from the asylum to tell us. I started reading his books about 200 years ago and have not recovered since. A comic genius maybe, but without any doubt insane!"
1,Broken before we got it blown up.,"We've not gotten to use the Giga Ball. I purchased it in October and when we tried to inflate it, we found 3 different holes in it. Patches were included but not the kind of blue that is need to seal the patches. I'm very disappointed in the product. I would like to return it if I could find the exact place that I purchased it from, but we didn't discover this until right after Christmas as it was given for a gift."
3,Fun while it lasts,"I bought this for my neices for Christmas. It was a lot of fun for a couple of hours, until one of them grazed a trash can and two of the bubbles popped. It was still usable after that, but there was one big spot with no air that hurt if you rolled down a hill in the ball. As long as we stayed in the grass, it seemed to hold up well with my neices rolling down a hill and running around the flat area. But, as you should expect, as soon as it bumped into something, it popped and the fun was over."
4,Great movie,"Great movie about the struggle to stay true to your beliefs versus musical success, keeping a family together and patriotism. I had seen this on tv a while back and fell in love with the movie and the final scenes which seem to be the climax of others moving on without you."
4,Habana Blues,"Good music, good acting, good story about two friends and their search for fame as rock musicians. Will they stay in Cuba or go to Spain? ENJOY!Pamela Collett, Oakland California"
2,Reviews Aren't Quite Right,"I got this book as a gift from a previous job I worked at and when I first moved from the southside to the northside, I really wanted to find places that I could eat, but this book wasn't really helpful to me for anything more than phone numbers and addresses. My two favorite restaurants, Soul Vegetarian East and Alice & Friends, got two star ratings. Alice & Friends food is absolutely excellent, and I go there every chance I get, and the vegan chocolate mousse pie is fantastic, and I'm not a dessert person at all. This book says the dessert is not desirable, and that blew my mind. And as for Soul Vegetarian East being so unique that it's hard to find seating, I've been there at least six times, and the only time I had trouble finding seating was on a late evening. During the day and early afternoons, I usually come in to maybe three or four tables of one or two people. I'm using this book more like a directory than for recommendations."
2,Disappointing,"I really appreciated the NY version, but this is pretty bad. The same exact review for Burrito Brothers is repeated on nine pages, just with different addresses. This is not close to the only repetition. I have been to some of these restaurants multiple times. Reading these reviews, I think they only went once to most of them. There are a lot more vegi friendly restaurants in DC. While the book is useful, I just think the authors were not trying very hard."
3,Please Make a Second Edition,This edition has incorrect information which is due to the fact it was published in 2005; is there a 2007/2nd edition yet?A few of the restaurants I checked out were no longer in business; which is a shame because they sounded good. I am just looking for a place that sells Veggie Dogs!
3,"It's ok, but nothing new...","This book was okay, but didn't add to the information already available in other resources.The information on homeschooling as an educational option was totally wrong and it was obvious the author has no knowledge of what homeschooling is really like and the incredible resources available to homeschoolers now as far as socialization opportunities as well as curricula and state requirements. He didn't do his research or even talk to homeschooling families to find out what it is really like.Unfortunately, because this erroneous information in his book, many parents will probably pass up this totally wonderful opportunity to truly help their Aspergers or autistic children."
3,"Good Tool, but wheels are a little small","This dollie could be made much better with bigger wheels. As it is now, the wheels only work well on perfectly flat surfaces. Bigger wheels would allow it work with imperfect surfaces and bumps."
5,Awesome product,The Speedollie is used in a lab training future in home appliance professionals. It makes moving around washers and dryers safe and efficient. So easy to get started using that time was spent dancing with the loaded Speedollie. Students and instructors alike are very impressed.
5,excellent production value,"As a professional audio engineer, It's rare to find material recorded in the last few years that isn't ""over produced"". This recording caspulizes the essence of the performer with very little studio ""tricks"". a must have for audio engineers, live and studio."
1,Cheese Lover,"Purchased this slicer from Amazon because my family consumes a lot of cheese and wire slicers seem to be the best. I selected this one because the discription sounded like it would hold up to heavy use. The screw holding one end of the wire fell out the first time I washed it and disappeared down the drain, the other screw was loose as well. I bought two stainless steel screws from the local hardware store with allen heads, the original screws are phillips and hard to get tight. I have no problems with the screws now but the wire has gotten very stretched with a couple of months of use. I am disappointed with this slicer overall and can't recommend it."
3,Larger Wire Cheese Slicer,"It appears to be very strong. One wire, why not a spare? It could be designed better. The bottom part of the cheese, 1/8 of an inch, was not cut due to the handle extension not permitting a closer to the board cut.Overall it is ok. It cuts the cheese and has a wide spance."
1,Don't waste your money,"There are many other wire cheese slicers on the market for much less money that last much longer. The wire tightening method on this one stinks. Screws come loose too easily. Wire that comes with the slicer stretches in a short time, and you run out of ability to tighten quickly because of the screw method. NO replacement wire can be found when it breaks, and it will because the wire is too thin. Mine broke after two months of use. Not being able to find a replacement wire, I recycled a guitar string which lasted a while, but in reality, this cheese slicer is more trouble than it is worth, especially with the high price tag."
2,Doo Wop Memories,"I brought this CD because my father was a member of The Flairs, (Ermines, Ebbtones.) He sings the lead on the song ""I'd Climb the Hills and Mountains."" and presumably background on the other song included. More than buying it for the songs or to reminisce, I purchased it to hear how my dad sounded during the brief (55-57) years he had with that group.If you are a true doo wop group afficionado then I would add this to my collection. Unfortunately it's not the best of the best the era had to offer, mostly it's people who were trying to find their way, but didn't get the right songs or lineup together. At the very least it's a good musical history review."
4,"good action, but a little glitchy","I loved Advent Rising, but there are parts in the game where it it seems like there is a glitch. Like in the beginning where you first see Seekers, when one scanned a civillian, he started beating him up. When he was beating him up, the sounds of the Seeker punching him were off from the actual cut scene action. And sometimes after a cut scene, it just freezes and goes right into game play and that can ruin the moment. Otherwise besides a few glitches, I really did love it and I am not judging the game by its slight glitches. I highly recommend playing this if you like action games, but anyone who doesn't like drama in an action game might not like it, but even you people who don't like drama should give it a shot."
3,needs better fighting,"I rented this vidia game and found it to be good in graphics but wished it was a little more controller intuitive, and more fluid in it's fighting segments of the game."
1,Glitches ruin what could be a great game,"The writing for this game is great. So much better than the usual dialogue you get from hack writers out there. The story is very compelling and I enjoy the game mechanics. The engine itself is not to badly designed however it is plagued with bugs. The game locks up repeatedly. So much so, that I have decided to simply return it. This game showed a lot of promise, and I hope that they release some sort of Live downloadable patch for it. I don't think that will happen though. I found the game impossible to play due to random freeze ups. Steer clear of this one, but definitely check out the sequel."
1,pff,"What an absolutely terrible game! I remember when this game came out about four years ago and it was referred to as a ""halo copy cat"" and I didn't really want anything to do with it, well I probably should have kept it that way. The graphics are pretty cheese-ball along with the story line and crap dialogue. Although the character you play as ""gideon"" jumps that of something caught between a lemur and gazelle which is about the only entertaining part of the game, otherwise advent rising is pretty weak and not worth a penny."
2,Very overhyped.,"This game should have been good, with the brilliant Orson Scott Card as the storywriter and renowned video game musician Tommy Tallarico as the sound track creator, but it isnt. The story line is very derrivitive and dull, the graphics are seriously outdated, the flick targeting system is annoying and unresponsive, the frame rate was aweful, and there were tons of bugs and glitches littered through out the game. The only good I can say about the game is that the flick targeting system is a good idea, the power ups are pretty cool, and the sountrack to the game is amazing. If you are an Orson Scott Card fan, or in search of a good game, then stay away from Advent Rising. Just hope that the sequels will be better."
2,the temptress is not as tempting as the first sorceress,this movie has its good points for example it has julie strain returning in the sequeal it also features julie k smith as a witch in the coven however the story line is a bit far fetched the first movie was far better and featured linda blair sorceress 2 also has to rely on sex to pull it through which isn't bad however anyone who rents sorcoress 2 will be upset that they just did not buy a skin flick it would have least not led you to believe that there was supposed to be a story there.
4,"Good, but charge up your drill","In the end these look nice, but I had to drill out the 1/4"" tapped hold to make it a 1/4"" through hole because my Nanosat speakers were already tapped. You can't securely mate a tapped hole to a tapped hole. Other than a few metal shards on my carpet, these units eventually worked well."
2,Stands are great but were not in good condition.,Item was not brand new as it was advertised on Amazon.Speaker stands were scratched in several places.I only kept the stands because I could not find the model anywhere else.I am disappointed that Amazon would sell items as new when they clearly were not.
2,Where the hell are the keyboards?,"I can't believe it!The lovely Europe keyboards are gone!!This band sounds exactly the same as the Joey Tempest solo Projects. Joey's voice is just mid range all the time, no high efforts, no high pitches....boring.Some songs are interesting tough."
4,classic Europe,"Considering the saturation and monotony of today's rock scene, Europe have done a good job of composing hard and soft melodies for every fan of hard rock, as some call it.Anyway, love listening to it and the combination of rock and ballads. Worth the money."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,"This album isnt as good as what people might say. It's good that the boys have gotten back together, But I would of have wanted a little more rock and guitar riff's etc.The songs are really mellow. A bit boring except for one or two of the tracks... By the way, I am a big number 1 EUROPE fan since the early days, And I'm sorry to say, That this album doesn't grab me."
2,"Start From the Dark or maybe Start ""IN"" the Dark!","If you've loved Europe's music in the 80's than be careful buying this cd! Not much rock melody here! Almost a one listen to cd, and then to the shelf. Every song has me waiting impatiently for John Norum's guitar lead. Want to know why? Because Joey Tempest has changed his singing style? He's gone from a great rock singer with great range to a mediocre vocalist with no range, dull and flat! The songs as a whole have regressed and are aimed toward today's pitiful imitation rock! Gosh, these guys had real class once. The only reason to buy this cd is if you want to hear John Norum, not because your looking forward to a new Europe cd."
2,Not the Europe I'd like to hear,"Well, I'm start saying that I'm not against bands evolute through times, but this is certainly not evolution. Playing songs with low-tuned guitars and melancholic lyrics and melodies are not for a band that once released Prisoners In Paradise, Out Of This World, The Final Cowntdown and other classic melodic rock anthems. Europe is another band, that like Metallica are victims of the horrible nu metal bands' fashion. They might have though that elements of nu would keep them updated. Well, sorry but, the band sounds outdated, tired and depressive. Very dfferent from the Europe that once I knew in the 80's and grew up listening. The worst thing is that are the same guys that recorded ""More Than Meets The Eye""! Please, John Norum, Joe Tempest and the guys, let's make real rock'n'roll and stop this mess. I hope that the next Europe album to be more interesting at least."
3,Litigators,I have read everything written by Mr Grisham. While this book was filled with twists and turns it was also a very hard read. I don't see a Grisham first-timer picking up this book and wanting to read more Grisham. This isn't a fast-paced book as some his are nor is it one of his best. I was disappointed in this latest work
1,Broke after 1 month!,"My shire/tb cross was standing tied to the trailer, something spooked her, and she backed up and the halter fell apart! It's not even fixable. I had bought a used hamilton from a consignment tack store before (it was then designated to 'back up' halter status when i purchased this one) and I'm glad I didn't throw it out! I think the manufacturer is making them differently- the fit is different (aka, ill-fitting), the rope material seems different, I'm not really happy!"
5,The Most Poetic Translation of the Tao Te Ching Around,"I have read several other versions and this one is by far the best in terms of its poetry. Also, interestingly, the two books, Tao and Te are in reverse order to most other translations, which this translator believes to be more authentic."
3,The Taoist religion's bible.,"This book is THE source if one is studying the dynamics of the Taoist religion. This translation by Victor Mair is as good as any out there and maybe even better since it used the oldest known manuscripts for its translation. In comparison to other religions, this one has the most in common with the Hindu faith. However, to understand the tenets of this faith, you may have to reread this a few times since the language does not flow extremely well with the English language. Even then, depending on your background religion, you may have to rely heavily on a commentary. In my opinion this text is full of double talk and borrowed wisdom that left me guessing how it has become popular and even survived. However, if you want to be well rounded in religious affairs, I suppose that this book may suffice for your study of Taoism."
5,Classic early reader,"A great introduction to oceanography. Many of the mapping tasks Engel anticipates have been completed, and, of course, some of the quantitative data has been refined, but still a lot of fun for story-time!"
5,Alternative Power Source,"I like the song Hey World, Secret Weapon and all the others. At the start and end of this album they're sounds of wind which is really cool.Petra's lead vocals is turning out to be as good as Volz' vocal contributions. Guitarist Bob Hartman also does a very good role on Sight Unseen and Who's On The Lord's Side."
3,"Ancient Wisdom, modern applications","Elizabeth Haich explored Yoga in the mid 20th century and although the prose is somewhat old fashioned by modern standards, the information is as relevant as ever. Long before well known authors wrote about positive affirmations or mind training the Yogis recognised the power of the mind. This book explores this ancient wisdom, and is therefore, well worth revisiting."
5,My third Caphalon Contemporary pot,"A quality pot - made in Toledo (not China). I bought this to replace a cheap Cuisinart pot of the same size. This one costs more, but the quality is worth it.A little thicker than the Cuisinart, so it takes a little longer to get to the desired temp.It easily holds two 15 oz. cans of vegetables.The lid is high quality and fits well."
4,"Great, but don't put in the dishwasher","I have had a full set of these pots and pans for several years. I absolutely love them. The manufacturer instructions warn you not to put them in the dishwasher. I have done that a number of times when the pan was not real messy and just needed a quick clean up. However, the anodized outside really suffered. Now I am replacing a couple of my pans because the outside is impossible to clean. I know this was my own fault for ignoring the recommendations, but they are true. Don't do what I did. You will ruin these pans in the dishwasher!"
5,Excellent saucepan for making fudge,I ordered this saucepan and another to make fudge. The first time I tried to make fudge the texture turned out creamy and it was tasty! I attribute the texture to the even heat of these saucepans. When it came time to clean the saucepan it only needed a little hot water and soap ... it cleaned up beautifully.
5,The avenue goes to war,I suggest a R F Delderfielf revival. Wonderful writer. Unfortunately I have read every book he has written wish he was still around
1,Not what is advertised!!!,"This video is called Tactical Sniper techniques for Law enforcement. I am a police officer/SWAT team member. I bought the video due to the fact that I am going to a sniper school and wanted an easy way to get some basic information. This video is nothing more than a ad for Mr Tubbs tach shooting vest. The shooting in this video is poorly explained and not at all Tactical. Im sure Mr Tubb is a far better shooter than I will ever be but he is not a ""tactical police sniper""! I would not recommend this to anyone unless you want to buy his vest."
1,Self promotional video with minimal instruction,"I've been an avid hunter for many years but wanted to learn a little more about long range shooting so I tried this video. Unfortunately, I can say I know no more now than I did before watching. A significant portion of the video is Tubb promoting a shooting vest, and the remainder of it is him or someone else talking about his credentials and then him showing off his shooting. I'm sorry to say I would have a hard time recommending this video to anyone other than a complete beginner who hasn't shot before."
5,great product,"It is superb, the goldfish looks so real. If you are looking for a screensaver, this is the one to buy. Very worth your money unlike other aguariums out there... I think this has the same makers of that 3D screensaver SereneScreen Marine Aquarium."
5,Love it!,"After buying cheaper skillets over a number of years only to have the coating scratch and start to peel, I was delighted with the Calphalon skillets. I have had 2 of the skillets for almost 2 years now and haven't a scratch on either one of them. Great product. My only complaint is the handle on the lid tends to get too hot to handle with out a mitt or hot pad but feel that is a minor point overall."
5,"When they say nonstick, they mean it.","I love this pan. It really works great, it's perfect for pancakes, omelettes, anything. And it really doesn't stick, which makes it soooo easy to clean.I got it almost 6 months ago and it's as perfect as the first day. However, I should say I take good care of it: only use wooden or plastic utensils, clean it with non-scratching products and never put it in the dishwasher."
4,Just the perfect pan for 2 people,"As empty nesters we find we no longer need the large pans we've used in the past. Calphalon is a favorite brand of ours. And while this pan was pretty pricey for us, we're not sorry we spent the money. The main thing we were looking for was an 8 inch pan with a lid. Those are a rarity. How fortunate for us we found not only the high-quality 8 inch calphalon pan but...it comes with a glass lid. Just perfect for cooking for one or two.The package arrived quite quickly and when we opened the outer Amazon box we were a little apprehensive about what the pan would look like since the actual pan box (inside the Amazon box) was in such awful shape. However, to our delight the pan was unscathed. We promptly washed it and have used it nearly daily since it arrived. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a small pan that also needs a lid."
4,WHAT THE......,"Yes, this is the best BLEACH album.....so far. Album has some great guitar work but surprisingly has some good praise and worship stuff added to it. I was very impressed with this album and would recommend it to anybody out there. Now the reason why I give it only 4 stars is because 2 of the original band members got out of the band, and I didnt like that decision."
3,Catchy modern pop...,"On Bleach's third album, the band comes through with more of the catchy modern pop evident from ""Static"". Musically, the styles present on each song are not that far from each other, (from upbeat ""noise"" pop to more laid back acoustic tracks), save for the spunky ""Race"". The more reflective rocker ""Reasons"" and rhythmic crooner ""You"" are included, as well as the radio hit ""Once Again, Here we are"". The best tracks, though, are the first two. Both with yearning themes, (""You're here, I want to feel Your Heartbeat"" and ""Steer me straight to be the man after Your own heart""), ""Heartbeat"" has an irresistible chorus melody and a cool guitar solo. ""Straight Shooter"" benefits from great harmonies and an almost ethereal pre-chorus guitar break. After the disciplined rhythm of ""Breathe"", however, I lose interest in the album. There are enough worthy features to make the album worth listening to though."
2,Names of the movies?,"By enlarging the DVD holder you can read the names of the movies included in this collection. Why this wasn't included is beyond me... what are you thinking Amazaon?Sword of LancelotKing Arthur the young warlordThe magic swordI have only seen sword of Lancelot (a long time ago) and since I can't remember much about it, it obviously didn't leave much of an impression on me."
5,Great sheets,"I was very pleased with these sheets - in fact they are on my bed right now. They do come out of the dryer a little wrinkled, but once they are are the bed, it does not afect the way they feel at all. I love comfortable and that is the way these sheets feel to me. I bought the queen size sheets and the fit was great. I would happily purchase these again."
3,Mint? Not really...,"The sheets themselves are nice enough, but I expected the Mint color to be the whole sheet a sort of light green. It doesn't show much on screen, but I thought that was just the vagaries of the screen view. Don't make my mistake. The ""Mint"" colored sheets are for all intents and purposes, WHITE, and the only thing remotely resembling green is the little bit of shiny thread trim, and that little bit is VERY PALE. Just a word to the wise."
1,Don't Buy these sheets at any price!,"These sheets are as thin as paper, they pill in the dryer, and are scratchy and uncomfortable to sleep on. The border is an extra piece of fabric sewn to the top of the sheet, instead of embroidered onto the sheet. I would NOT buy again!"
2,Barely Reaches Average,"To the question: Who Doesn't Love Raymond!!!, that some have posed here. Can I answer, I dont! This comedy is average at best. Its not terrible, but it just isnt that funny. Here in the UK, unlike brilliant shows we import from the US like; Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Will and Grace, Frasier, Sex and the City....this comedy is really average.Maybe its Ray Romano, who gets paid a ridiculous sum each episode. Face it he's not funny! His delivery is like Droopy on downers, yes that dull. Even here someone said in a review that the other characters were funnier.This comedy is one step from the Cosby Show, and that is not a complement, trust me. The gags are lined up with big red flags before they arrive for the audience to laugh at. Very 1970s.Here in the UK, unlike the other brilliant comedies we import from the US, this show is put on at 8am in the week. Ie the ""dead zone"", as people just arent interested in it. Sorry!"
4,Season 2 of ELR,"About as good as season 1 or slightly better. Classic episodes this season include THE LETTER, SIX FEET UNDER and BROTHER. The show writers are slowly begining to hit their stride."
4,Holy Crap!,"The Second season of Everybody Loves Raymond features these highlightsRay helps Ally appreciate piano lessons.Ray is shocked to find his parents may have separated in his youthRay works at home and finds new ways to annoy DebraRay attends his reunion and discovers his wife was a cool kidRay learns that balancing the check book isn't as easy as he thoughtRay tricks his mom about Debra being a Good Girl.Annual Parent Gift Faux PaxRay buys his dad an Aquarium and wonders why his dad hates itFinally as is the usual tradition for ELR the season finale showcases a major event flashback in Rays life, this season is the wedding that Ray somehow manages to get through with the help of socks."
1,Humor for Sheeple,"Take some working class stereotypes, throw in some cliched family dysfunction, a heavy dose of 2nd grade level sarcasm, some roadkill sit-com retread settings, poor line delivery, sloppy timing, and terrible writing. Stir well. Serve in slop bucket to mindless American viewers."
5,Some people do love Raymond,"As a married 30-something with 3 kids, this show rings so true and it just cracks me up. The cast is great, and work so well together. I just LOVE this show and am thrilled it is on DVD so I can enjoy it over and over again.I only wish they had a PLAY ALL option."
5,everyone loves raymond second series,"I ordered this as part of a xmas gift, but had to return it it was the wrong series...Was refunded promptly."
5,Amazing Show!,This show is hilarious! They really did a good job with a low starting budget. The actors are all great and very unbelievable trailer trashy!
2,Bought it for school,"I bought this as required reading for a class on the Revolutionary War. I think I read maybe half a chapter before I gave up. Too wordy and too much text on the pages (college students will feel my pain on that... don't you just hate it when they squeeze so many flippin' letters on a page? Makes your eyes hurt!).I appreciate the unique perspective that the book and research offers, but it just was not as interesting as I would've hoped.Neither was the class though, I stopped going about mid way through the semester and took the fail...."
4,Bravo.,"This is a stylish, shadowed mystery set in 19th century Spain and built around the relationship between the aging fencing virtuoso Don Jaime de Astarloa (Omero Antonutti) and his intruiging, beautiful pupil, Adela de Otero (the lovely and talented Assumpta Serna). Although the plot drags at times and is not particularly unpredictable, the quality of the acting, cinematography (full of shadows, mist and opulent period rooms) and fencing scenes set it well apart from the average Blockbuster fare. And, at a curt 88 minutes, it can provide a swift, bittersweet diversion in even the busiest week or weekend. Que bueno."
5,A must read for all fans,"This is absolutely one of the better (if not the best) of the changing breed source books. Players and readers familiar with the Werewolf: The Apocalypse story should definitely buy this book. As the eldest of the Changing Breeds, the Mokole have many stories that the younger Garou have never dreamed of.Players will be delighted in finding a literal opposite game features when playing a Dragon. From character creation, to actual story development, Mokole will shed light on many aspects of the world's history the Garou have simply forgotten.In addition to great new game features, the book has some of the strongest art I have seen throughout the series that strongly compliment the written material.All in all, a must buy if you are interested in exploring the realm of the changing breeds beyond the point of view of the Garou."
5,Brilliant!!,"Fantastic Book that I wish I could force all of America to read. It makes sense, it vibes well, it's realistic, it's healthy, and it works. Please read this book if you have a problem with even a little weight or especially just overeating!!!"
3,"Good advice, dumbed-down","This book provides good, constructive facts and advice on overcoming overeating without dieting, but it is presented entirely in sound bites. Every page spread has a list of bullet points on the left side and a single, large-font pull quote on the right side. It could very easily be turned into a massive PowerPoint file.Depending on who you are, this could be just what you need. If you're in a hurry, or don't like to read, or need some quick inspiration, it could be great. If you don't mind reading and thinking, or you like self-help books that persuade rather than preach, or you're looking for ""real-life"" anecdotes to help inspire you, this might not be your cup of tea. If you're in the latter category, I recommend ""Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program That Works"" over this book."
3,Weight Loss Should Not Be a Cure for Compulsive Overeating,"Weight loss is a by product of a non dieting lifestyle, not the focus. These authors put way too much emphasis on physical weight loss rather than love and unconditional acceptance. This book is not recognizing the two types of hunger, physical and psychological. It's okay to have both hungers in the recovery process (for compulsive overeating). The authors don't address this, but rather turn physical hunger into a 'rule' and that to me is what dieting is. Rules. I found this book to be a huge disappointment."
3,"OK, but not that revolutionary. (Don't Eat if Not Hungry).","This is a nice book, and the price is great! But I can't see what's so revolutionary. Keep a journal regarding snacking; face feelings rather than snacking, and so on. It's well-written, but not that new. The authors devote one paragraph to exercise, emphasizing food thoughtfulness on the other 300 pages. But so many people say they starting walking 2 miles a day consistently and lost 40 pounds, that maybe general exercise (not sweating/pain) should get more emphasis."
3,"Disappointing, at least for my application","If you are looking for cheap ice packs/heat pads, this product may be for you.I found them too bulky. And, several of the 3 pads sampled leaked water after a couple of uses.The product arrives as a pile of plastic-encased beads in thin sheets. The beads absorb water by soaking water into the sheets. Then, you're supposed to work them to get the water into the beads. This is where tearing probably occurs. If you can live with the minor leaks, the ice packs are very useful. I was hoping to cool my laptop in the summmer by placing an icepack under the cooler. With leaking this is impractical.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
2,ok...,"This gun looks great, feel heavy.BUT.... Mine doesn't fire right. It even came with a European charger (Wont fit into American outlets)and I had to get a new one from them (free). It also came with a black flash protector, and I couldn't use that here anyway. I also noticed that there was corrosion all over the screws. It also looks like it might of been used ( bb holes in the box and through the instructions...)The only reason I'm giving it more than 1 star is because the look."
5,Another keeper,"I have been listening to all the PERRY MASON mystery titles that I can find on Audio. Colonial Radio has put together a very enjoyable series which cover the first five books in the series. They are well acted, and of course well written. They are a great way to spend a few hours trying to solve a mystery."
5,great stories from great people,the fugees tell there interesting and amazing story in this great interview.
2,Interesting,I am just beginning to read the book and tales some peace of mind to read it. But so far ideas presented are worth continuing.
3,I feel like I'm being forced to buy Prozac,"I'm more than half way through and I'm waiting for something else to happen except it's not. I keep being told about how Prozac and similar drugs are fabulous. And while I don't have a strong position either way, I thought this book would go more deeply into what people with personality disorders look it. It definitely does but it's laden with opinion of one solution."
4,just started reading it and loving it!,"Having medical background and some preliminary knowledge on modus operandi of sensorimotor faculty of the brain and neuroplasticity, I find this book very interesting in terms of looking at a bigger picture: how psychiatry and neurology are smoothly blended together; why brain is not isolated from rest of the body; why environment brings about changes in our brain just like it does on our skin/body and how. I am just finishing first chapter and looking forward to going over rest of the book!"
3,Hidden Syndromes,"An interesting book to read and understand all syndromes and how they appear. Although too much on the side of using Prozac which now is not used as much as many patients become hooked on such medicines . If you take that away,or do not pay much attention to this part, it is very informative and you can understand those who are near you who have these syndromes."
2,Not a big help,"The book don't share the objetive information that I waited.It don't help you to diagnose or perceive the ""shadow syndromes"".A lot of real cases but little epidemiologic, neuropsychiatric, and treatment information.And it don't do the most important in my opinion: to diferenciate from a shadow syndrome to the other."
5,A fascinating read!,"I heard John Ratey speak at a conference on ADD, and had to read this book. He provides fascinating insight into the brain and the origins of mental health disorders. When you read this book you may recognize yourself or other people in your life. Little quirks in personality will suddenly make sense to you. Addictions may be better understood as self-medicating as he explains the effects drugs have on different areas of the brain.If you are at all interested in mental health issues, you have to read this book. It could change your perception of mental illness."
1,Sophomoric Fumbling,Codrescu's work in this book is like a 13-year-old's self-conscious attempt at writing a romance diary. The first sentence alone is as unacceptably ill-wrought as the rest of the writing is embarrassingly over-wrought. Codrescu is a great writer and he should be ashamed. Yikes and yuck.
1,Offended,I did not appreciate this book very much. I felt that the sexual content was inappropriate and overdone. More could have been given to the plot and the historical content and less could have been given to an 80 year old man's perverted exploits.I was dissappointed in this book completely.
5,to be there in the lion's den! Delight!,"I dragged this book home like a lion a fresh-killed antelope & set myself down at an unforgettable feast. It's Borges, Eco, and Vonnegut, but hip, new, American -- and beautifully illuminist. As a woman, subject to chills of wonder and amusement, I thought this was first rate entertainment and great literature, too."
1,How anyone made it through this book is beyond me,"This book somehow manages to combine stories of the gilded age of Venice and the sexual escapades of Casanova and come out completely boring. As the legendary lover Casanova is in his old age, he is the librarian at an isolated estate in Bohemia. He entertains himself by telling the stories of his youth, of Venice and Paris, of royals and their affairs, to his maid Laura. One would think that it would at least have enough juice to it to be readable! But no, I had to put this miserable book away before finishing it."
2,"Great design, bad for glass tops","I have a glass top stove. The Calphalon contemporary after only 3-4 uses slightly warped. It was enough to have a perceivable ""wobble"" when using it on the glass top. I subsequently have purchased the Anolon Pro series of pans which has not exibited this behavior. I have used the pans significantly longer than I did the Calphalon."
1,Wobble,"I Have a glass top stove as well and this pan warped. Calphalon replaced my first one, but the replacment warped as well. I ended up returning it. Very expensive for such a bad product."
1,Warps Under Most Conditions,"This pan warped after the first use, even though I followed the use instructions and did not use high heat. Thankfully Calphalon has excellent customer service, and prepaid the return shipping. They state to start the pan on low heat and very gradually bring it up to temperature. This is a real inconvenience. I would expect better from this manufacturer and especially at this price. Because of the warping the pan is of only limited use. I plan to try their way of preheating on the replacement pan, but at the first sign of trouble, I intend to return it for a refund."
5,Kitchen Staple,"I love this pan and use it all the time. I make eggs or a frittata for 1-2 people, hot sandwiches, small quantities of sauce and can even blanch small amounts of vegetables in it. I have both this and the 10 inch pan and for a 2 person home I use this 8 inch pan most often. If you have a larger home then the 10 inch would probably be more handy."
5,Omelette pan,"This omelette pan by Calphalon is outstanding. For the first time in my life, I can actually make an omelette without it falling apart."
3,Still looking for perfection,"This Calphalon is nicely sized and balanced. However, I'm still looking for the perfect non-stick fry pan. I've used this for the last month, and have found the non-stick qualities and cleanability (if there is such a word) haven't performed to my expectations. My main use is for eggs, and they still stick, especially if scrambled. I use Egg Beaters, and haven't found that they ""slid"" out of the pan, OR easily wiped-clean."
1,"unsafe, had to return","We got this pan for making omelets. However, the handle became very hot, too hot to grab even, and the pan was unusable safely. We had to return it."
4,Very good and sturdy non-stick pan,"This is a great everyday pan for small size dishes. it is deeper as compared to calaphlon triply omelete pan so its more versatile for stir frying etc...It is heavy and looks very strong ...and is one of the best non-stick pans I have used ..I did return this pan since it had black/burn mark on it and it came w/o box and booklet and unprofessionally wrapped in just a platic wrap and also had a black burn mark on it (not very visble though). I have the griddle from same product line and holds the same review.This plan is pricey at 39$ especially if you compare 2 pans - 10 and 12 inch for ~48$! if you are not too inclined on the smaller pan, go for the bundled deal!"
5,Grammy Time Box Set- How did they get so much funk in a box?,"I have an extensive collection of cds (if I do say so myself) including a number of box sets. THIS IS THE BEST BOX SET I HAVE EVER HEARD. I put this thing on and I could not leave the room, I was dancing and singing like I hadn't done in 20 years. Everytime I moved to the machine to cut it off -the music made me stop. If you like James Brown and if you can only get one compliation of his work THIS IS THE ONE. There it is, mother popcorn,licking stick, doing it to death, can't stand it, hot pants, soul power and, believe it or not even MORE- so much funk it should be declared a deadly weapon. The godfather strikes again and again and again with his superbad, papa's got a brand new bag, havin a funky good time self 'cause it he made it that way-FUNKY. Don't miss this one and don't let your friends miss it either!!!!!"
5,Minister of the New New Super Heavy Funk,"How can I possibly describe my feelings for this box set? I bought ""Star Time"" in 1995 and it ruled my stereo for over a year. James Brown for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Each CD is jammed with the magic and intensity of Mr. Brown and his dozens of funky collaborators. I'm particularly enamored of the rhythmic explosions of the early 1970s compositions (Bootsy Collins, baby!), but I also get down to the sixties songs. Each and every James Brown scream is awe-inspiring. In short, ""Star Time"" is indispensable and a truly majestic collection of revolutionary music."
4,"James Brown ""Star Time""","This 4-pack of James Brown best CDs is a good value, comes with an interesting booklet with his bio & reviews. Suggest for fans of the ""GodFather of Soul""."
3,Solid,"This recording is not musically exceptional and will not change your life. That said, it's a good solid recording by a trio that has been around the block. The Great Jazz Trio, in this incarnation featuring Hank Jones along with brother Elvin on drums plays with the sure hand of folks who have spent a lifetime making just this sort of music. I wouldn't recommend beginning your exploration of jazz music here, but if you have a foundation and like a good, solid trio playing teriffic old chestnuts you may well enjoy spending some time with these comfortable old (reliable) hands."
1,"Frustrations, frustrations!",Had to figure out by myself why CD wasn't installing on my RedHat 7.0. (get patch from otn.oracle.com!) Wasted a lot of time when osborne could have just simply put a tip on their website. Tsk tsk...
2,Can't get Oracle to install,"I've been sitting here for 2 days trying to get the Oracle that was shipped with the book to install. I've read and re-read the instructions and various README files, but nothing works. I am running RedHat 7.0 Linux kernel 2.2.16 and I run Oracle on Solaris at work, so I pretty much know what I'm doing. The Oracle Universal Installer hangs at Database Creation Progress, at 92%, the logs show nothing. Once in a while, I get an ORA-03113, but usually it just hangs. So I thought I would send an email to the Steve Bobrowski, but alas, his email address is nowhere to be found, or maybe I'm just missing it somewhere.This book looked good in the bookstore, but a simple problem like failing to load the provided software will force me to return it. I can not suggest buying this book."
3,Decent Oracle8i Introduction Book,"After trying for several days to install Oracle8i 8.6.1 that shipped with the book on RedHat 7.0, I found out that there is a glibc incompatability between Oracle and RedHat 7.0. ...Great, thanks RedHat...their suggestion is to downgrade to RH6.2. Why is there no comment about this at Osborne?Downgraded to RH 6.2 and Oracle installed, finally. This book is great, I would have given it 4 stars, but for the lack of support from Osborne in trying to solve my problem. If you are going to ship (and charge for) software with your books, Osborne, you better be prepared to provide some support!"
2,"Good intentions, but poor definition...","The install will not work for me in Mandrake 8.2. The cdrom system may require older kernels of Linux. But, another reviewer stated the same problem, being that the database installation hangs up, which is what I experience. The directory ownership is not defined explicitly, and some instructions assume too much is already known. If someone has enough savvy to work their way through the install, why would they need this book?"
1,Also Having trouble with this book,"I can't get passed page 21 of the book. I've tried the Oracle Installer on Suse 7.2, Red Hat 7.2, and Mandrake, and the Oracle Universal Installer just won't work. I wish I could get my money back for this book. Use a different resource."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,"I bought this book (oct-2001) & I never have oracle experiance before so this book put me on the road.All what you need is some linux basics make sure to install ORACLE8i which it comes with this book under RedHat 6.2 .I treid 7.1 but it did not work I treid to install (compat glib , compat lib ..) and change the variable ASSUME_KERNAL=2.2.4...But it did not work fine in the end of installation...the frist 3 chapters are verty easy and staight but when it comes to java programing for oralce here is the diffecult part you need to have JAVA exp. espacialy with JDBCThats why I rated this book 4/5. Thanks Steve for your great book!"
1,Waste of time for even a mid-level Oracle DBA,"This book is really a starter kit. It is an almost trivial overview that covers nothing more than a demo-level, automated (installer) walkthrough. I suppose it is worth the price for the 8.1.6.0 (not even 8.1.6.1) version included if this is the only way you can get the software.Author well intentioned but trivial, bought it and returned it."
1,The install procedure is wrong!,"Bobrowski should improve the install procedure, the install procedure printed in this book is worthless. Without a running database the complete book is worthless. The other guys, who rated this book obviously did'nt install ORACLE. As database trainer I can't suggest this book!"
3,"Not worth full price. Cool GH package, though.","Hey, if you can get this used for cheap, go for it. Having two hours of classic Maiden on two CDs is pretty cool indeed. I really don't need to elaborate too much . . . these are all fantastic songs from one of the very best metal bands ever.The game is a somewhat simple first person shooter. It's kind of fun. Again, if you can get the package cheap, it's worth it. It's not the best first person shooter, but it's ok."
4,A Must Have for Any Hardcore Maiden Fan,"I've been a fan of Maiden for years, seen them live several times, and of course listened to the albums endlessly. When I originally saw this I figured it was just another ""greatest hits"" compilation, which to a degree it is, but really what sold me was the computer game. Will it win game of the year, no, but come on it is a freaking game based on a heavy metal band and it is actually pretty decent. If you want the greatest graphics and all that kind of stuff look elsewhere but for those of us just looking to enjoy some Maiden I think you'll thoroughly enjoy the cd and game"
2,Prety good CD set...Louzy game,If you are thinking about buying this set because you are expecting to get a decent Iron Maiden Video Game to Play I have three words of advice...DONT DO IT.There are alot of Maiden Classics and a couple of Blaze Bayley songs...Paul Diallo is absent from this record...There is a very nice studio version of Wrathchild with Bruce Dickinson on vocals.That said ...you can get most of these songs if you buy Best of The Beast...and that record has some Paul Diallo songs on it.A good CD to buy if you are looking to play a louzy Game...or fill out a collection.
3,Better Cds out there,"I have been following Maiden since the Killers album (yes, album...ie LP) and in my opinion you can do much better than buy this CD. If you are a new Maiden fan, you might want to just buy the Live After Death cd, as it has a lot of classic Maiden tunes for a much cheaper price. Once you have listened to ""Live After Death"", and want to dive deeper into Maiden, then go and buy ""Somewhere in Time"", as this was released after Live After Death. If you still are hungry for more Maiden, then go ahead and pick up the Paul DiAnno CDs (Iron Maiden, and Killers). I wouldn't waste my time with any Iron Maiden title after Somewhere in Time."
1,"If you love 3D games, keep moving along...","The game graphics are outdated by at least 4 years. Nastypixalations as well as inability to do anything more than point yourmouse at a predestined area to shoot baddies. I had some video issues and I contacted tech support back in December, 6 months later still no response (thank goodness I fixed it myself!)... The makers of this game, Synthetic Dimensions, took Maiden to the bloody cleaners when they pitched the band this horrible rendition of a video game. It is presumed by the cheesiness of the graphics and extrememly poor game play indicates that SD doesn't have much of a clue about the video game industry unless you still consider Pac Man the epitome of video gaming. If you are looking to buy this title, go to an online auction where you can get a great deal and still have Piece of Mind when you realize the hype was not worth the wait..."
3,"Good introduction of the band, but.....","Buy Best of the Beast if your looking for greatist hits compilation, unless you really want the game. A box set would of been better. As I said in the Best of the Beast review, it's a good album for an introduction to the band but if you have acsess to all their albums, you are better off recording a CD of your personal favorites. The unreleased live versions on both aren't as good as the studio versions anyway."
2,Are Maiden Becoming KISS?,"I don't see what the point of this album was. Best Of The Beast has much better track collection and is cheaper. The video game is the only reason to get this, but all it is is a Doom-clone that goes through Maiden-ish worlds from their albums (i.e., Egyptian, Hell, Future, Seventh Son, etc.). Get Best Of The Beast if you need a Maiden collection. This just seems like a way to get more money from fans."
3,Dog carrier,"My little dog weighs 8 lbs. and barely fits. Nice fabric, but I would recommend ordering a larger size if you want your dog to be good and secure."
2,The Series may be doomed,"Having read and enjoyed the other Owen Archer books, I want to concur with the previous reviewer who found this book disappointing. I found it extremely disappointing. With the exception of the wonderful character of Magda the Riverwoman, all the main characters are too old, too sick, too depressed, or too self doubting to be credible in their problem solving ability. Lucy's whining in particular becomes very tedious. The plot is also weaker than usual. Its seems to serve mostly as backgrund for expoloring the angst of the chracters, and the ending leaves a major puzzle piece unanswered. Perhaps it's time to retire the series unless the younger characters like Jasper and Alisoun can be developed to pick up the slack and without such religious and emotional baggage."
5,The Cross-legged knight by Candace Robb,"Excellent addition to her medieval series which is very evocative of the era and place, to me. Fine storytellng and character continuity from book to book about Owen Archer and the mix of political situations and villany that is sorted out on several levels throughout the book."
3,"Great info, kind of basic",Information is great. Software is not very elaborate. OK if you need to cut and paste. I ordered the book after receiving the software.
3,Ssslllloooowwww,"This book was a little slow for me at times, or boring. I must confess, I never finished it. But when I read a book I don't like I always seem to remember all the parts that I DID like. Some fave details were the 'philtrum' myth. You know that little thing above you lip and below your nose? Well you supposedly get it before birth when an angel presses her finger there and says 'shh' to keep you from telling the secrets of the world. Bently doesn't have one. One of my fave characters was Slally, the girl who talked in gibberish. Well, Bently UNDERSTOOD her gibberish. I never finshed the book but near the end I saw a sentence that added suspense to the book. I won't tell you what it is though. :) But I've seen good reviews for this book. Some like it, I didn't. Whether or not you like this book depends on your taste in style of writing. So it could be your fave food or that yucky stuff that Mom insists that you'll love and 'eat it up now you'll thank me later.'"
2,Too comtemporary to be compared to Tolkien & Star Wars,"Prince Ombra has appeared in the world a thousand times in the form of the greatest and most evil foes of history. And a thousand times, a special person has been born into the world to attempt his defeat. These stories are well known: David and Goliath, King Arthur, etc. However, Roderick MacLeish tells a less memorable story of one such warrior who is only 8 years old. The tale is set in modern times. The child is hunted by a lunatic with a gun. His ""Merlin"" is a doctor. The dangers and perils are not so grand, and the form that Prince Ombra takes isn't very fantastical. The idea behind the story was interesting, but it could have been developed better. Yes, I suppose it was entertaining, but what kept the pages turning for me was knowing I could get on to a better book when I finished this one."
3,Beware This Edition!,"I agree with all the positive reviews of this story and the older editions of the book. HOWEVER! This edition has been edited to be more appropriate for younger readers even though it was not written for children. The result is that the narrative is non-sensical at times due to the slipshod manner of the edits.The end of chapter 13 is the worst example that I am aware of as I have only had the mistakes drawn to my attention by my friend reading the story for the first time. Imagine my disappointment when she asked why a part of the story I remembered as very powerful simply did not make sense. I checked with an older edition and found missing paragraphs and rewritten sentences. I have no idea whether there are other significant problems, but this one was enough for me.I will be buying a used copy to replace my friend's 'defective' edition."
5,A look at the more entertaining side of farming,"I read this book when I was quite young, and I was happy to find a good used copy. People who are interested in CSA and urban gardening will find John Gould's memoir educational and very funny. I wish readers could obtain a digital copy of this book."
5,very entertaining,"I really enjoyed watching this movie because it is humorous and engaging. The protagonist, Fanny Zander, comes to a Swedish village to see the house which her grandfather left her in his will. All the women in the village start disliking her immediately because of the way she dresses and her profession. (She is a night club performer.)Some of the women become jealous of her because she attracts male attention. They also dislike her companion because he is dark.Axel Flogfält dislikes her because she refuses to sell the house to him.The movie is thoroughly enjoyable and a little unpredictable."
5,Smooth move is right,"I was told about this by my boss (a women). I never new about this product but , now that I do I will make sure anyone having a same problem as me to get this stuff. 1 box is $4.99 at supermarket, Amazon gives you 6 boxes for alittle more then $15 ( and am getting a subscription) How could you beat that. Thank you who ever made this stuff I never feel bloated any more."
4,Definitely works,"I concur with most of the reviews in regards to steeping time and dosage. As everyone's body makeup/chemistry is different, I would certainly be judicious in your first cup and brew it for only 5-6 minutes. In less than 2 hours I was definitely feeling nature call; however I had no cramping or pain. I likely would have though if I had steeped it any longer. Also, be reminded that ANY type of laxative (medicinal or herbal) can make the intestine lazy and dependent, so use only when a diet high in fiber and liquid (along with exercise) isn't enough to keep you ""regular""."
4,good if your looking for a natural laxative,"I have suffered from constipation for most of my life.in my lifestyle i include excersise, extra water, fruits, veggies but it doesnt cut it. kefir helped for a while, and so did pearls(acidophilus, but it gets expensive. my boyfriend got me this tea, and i can say it works, but for me it still causes cramps and discomfort, not as bad as exlax, ducolax, etc. For me it takes between 12-16 hrs to take effect, on a full 10-15 minute steep. the taste is not bad, mildly sweet. I like that its natural. i will finish the pack, mostly for when i feel bloated and need the extra help but i think ima stick to my other tea, rose petals, or in spanish, TE DE CASTILLA. that is what my mother would give me when i was a baby, and it helps keep me regular as long as i take it daily."
5,great product,"Great tea, works. Natural laxative. Drink one cup before sleep and other day everything is moving ;-)"
5,Does the job,"Smooth Move tea works really well. The tea has a pleasant taste. Plus, I haven't had any uncomfortable cramping."
5,Smooth Move,I've used this product for years. I used to always go to a health food store or other store that sold it. I love that I can buy it in bulk through Amazon.com.
1,"It works, but at a price","SmoothMove accomplishes its purpose, but after only five uses over 6-8 weeks my large intestine feels irritated and my usually efficient digestive process has been thoroughly disrupted. The nurse who recommended it didn't warn me to try brewing it only five minutes or less at first try; I didn't find that out until it was too late. BTW, I had to take this because of hydrocodon side effects. Be very cautious about using this product: senna is nothing to fool around with."
2,not sure,"I'm not sure if I like it, the taste is a little weird to me. I think I'll stick with magnesium."
2,Traditional Medicine,"The product has a great potential for people not wanting to get hooked to normal fiber intact supplements like Metamucil or Miralax, or just the consistent pressure of wanting to go to the bathroom. Senna Tea has its laxative properties imbued with a little bit of discomfort when the urge to go arrives and can be quite painful, and the continued use of it can lead to bowel cancer and other unspeakable horrors. The only reason I gave it two stars was the fact that it doesn't put your body in a state of requiring fiber supplements, for example after 1-2 sessions of the tea you can put your rests aside and look forward to gaining all your intakes from eating right."
3,"I have used this product in the past, however....","I just switched to a vegan diet and now I sleep much better and I have zero need for this tea. Read the book, ""Skinny Bitches"", it's all about how bad meat, fish, poultry and even dairy products are for us."
3,"Not as ""smooth"" as you think...","The taste isn't intolerable, but I'd rather not drink it. Also, I had terrible cramping that kept me up all night. I will say that it did do what it was suppose to, just not as ""smooth""-ly as i thought. I bought senna in pill form for future needs."
5,For Short Term Use,I'm on 8th day of Master Cleanse & a cup of this Smooth Move senna tea each night has been very effective the following morning. I'm looking for an alternate now to continue the cleanse as there are potential dangers to longer use and is not recommended using for more than seven days. Google senna for potential dangers and side effects.
5,Love It!,"Was browsing and found this pan for the unbelievable price of $29.99 (department store online sale!) so I just could not resist purchasing. It definately serves it's purpose, I got it mainly to bake chicken legs/thighs. You can never go wrong with purchasing Calphalon -- their products are great and have life warranty. I love this pan...and to know I got it for this price...WOW!!!"
5,I tip my hat to the author,"This was a marvelous book. A very easy and quick read without all the difficult to understand psychological verbage in many relationship books. Joey O'conner recognizes that for a relationship to be robust and not end, one must be true friends, as well as be in love. Yes, there is a difference. The content of this work is relevant for the adult as well as the young person anticiapting a first relationship. I also recommend Eknath Easwaran's ""Bghagavad Gita for Daily Living, to Love me is to Know me"". A rather dated book, but factual still today."
1,Lets try to be english with a has been english band!!!!!!,"Please do not buy this garbage!!!!!!The Dropkicks try to be english and cover really poor songs by this band called the business who are as most know horrible.Then to make matters worse the business massacre the dropkick songs.They also allow Al Barr there new singer(if you want to call him a singer)screw-up boys on the docks!!!!!!This once great outfit is really stinkin up the bar these days!!!!!drop the dropkicks and pick-up on a new group from boston,ma called the explosion!!!!!"
1,Horrible Beyond Compare-Not up to Murphy Standard!,"I am extremly disappointed with the Dropkick Murphys and this mob mentality collaboration with the business.The songs sound rushed , the guitar sound is hollow and the vocals are very,very weak.The band really wasted their time covering business songs and the business massacered the dropkick,s songs.God I miss the days of do or die ! This album is not up to typical murphy standard!"
5,Oxygen Sensor,The product worked perfectly and I saved over $85 by buying from Amazon.Buying this part from the auto manufacturer would have cost $110 more.I will always check Amazon first for my online parts!
5,Perfect fit,"Put the included flange on the sensor, disconnected the battery, removed old sensor, installed new one, reconnected battery, no more check engine light."
3,False advertisement......,The easy way to say it is the picture for this product is very misleading. Dont expect to get what you see. The pic in advertisement is the actual OEM piece. Thats not what you get though. It comes in 2 pieces with adapter plate. Adapter plate works but not even close to the original.So far the sensor works but will have to see how long it lasts.... It would be nice if the ads were pics of what you actually get.
2,Best for those who had dysfunctional father relationships,"This book is filled with stories and anecdotes that I am sure would be very helpful to women who had difficult relationships with their fathers or who had many unresolved issues with their fathers. As a woman who had a good relationship with her dad and who was lucky enough to find love and closure at the end of his life, I haven't found this book to be of much help to me personally. I grew tired of reading so many negative examples of what the father/daughter relationship could be, and I found very little comfort or guidance through my own grief. I think this book could be valuable for some, but it wasn't the help I had hoped for."
1,"This author needs a therapist, not a book contract","I tried to read this book after the death of my Dad due to a long battle with cancer. This author can only ""help"" or more accurately share stories of how dysfunctional her relationship with her father was, and how promiscuous she was, what a bad friend she was to those around her, rather than actually tell you anything about what life is like after the death of a father that you had a healthy relationship with. If you are normal and your father is normal, and you were friends with your father, this book is not for you. If you need therapy and your Dad needs therapy, here is clearly the book for you.This book is full of sweeping generalizations to validate the author's bad decisions in the relationships in her life. It is not backed up with any research or facts of any kind. She should have bought a journal and written about the bad relationship in private rather than publish it. Please do not buy this book."
5,Honesty,"As I began to read the introduction to this amazing book, it was as if I were dictating and Clea was simply putting the words on paper. Although our Father's were educated in different ways, the grief of a slow death is much different. My Father's illness lasted for six years and I felt like he died a million times before the actual death. Clea has taken an uncomfortable reality and placed it on a page for confirmation and viewing by all who have suffered the loss of our greatest Love as daughters. This is an amazing find!!!"
4,Not what I thought it would be,"I purchased this book thinking that it also dealt with ""girls"" who have lost their fathers. My father passed when I was 4 years old and this was not the book for me. I didn't read the entire book, once I got into chapter one, I knew it didn't pertain to me. So, to help those of you who may want to purchase this book, it's really written for the age range of upper teens through adults of any age. It's also written to appeal to those who have had fairly good/ healthy relationships with their dads. I hope this review helps, I rated it 4 stars because it does seem very well written (what I read of it)."
3,Second half of book is engrossing,"This is the third Lively novel I have read recently, and the least satisfying. (The others are ""Moon Tiger"" and ""The Photograph""). Once the novel's action moves to the fictional land of Callimbia, the book becomes quite engrossing, but half the novel is over. Neither of the two main characters, Howard and Lucy, is particularly memorable. Given Lucy's profession, she seems a bit clueless when thrust into the middle of a major news event.I had never read a fictional account of a hostage situation, and found this one credible. Two secondary characters stand out: Howard's girl friend, who does not really like him, but the sex is fine, and she likes being part of a couple; the translator, who thinks of himself as a nice person, and is not wrong exactly, but who is quite willing to serve as an instrument of evil."
5,Wooster 4-1/2 roller,"Love these rollers, great for small and large areas. Can't find these in the stores anymore, glad they are available at Amazon."
4,Thin and comfortable but...,"These are pretty good and comfortable, but the ribs are 4 inches down the shaft. So at best she is going to feel an inch or two. The price is great, and so far they have caught everything, so I would buy them at again. And the company is great!"
5,All for the Price of a Cup of Coffee,"The book, ""Cafes of Paris,"" offers American tourists the cheapest and, I believe, the most entertaining and comfortable way to experience Paris, especially with the weak U.S. dollar. You can sit in a coffee shop for hours - reading and enjoying Paris street life - all for the price of a cup of coffee. Inexpensive lunches can be shared with friends in the cafe's casual atmosphere. The book is extremely well organized for the sight-seer; cafes are indexed by tourist attraction and arrondissement with the nearest metro stop and the price of a cup of coffee available at a glance. And if you aren't going to Paris, read the humorous anecdotes, descriptions of the decor, and the literary history of cafe life for a vicarious mini-vacation. Revised in 2000, prices have gone up but the richness of Paris cafe life will never be out of date."
4,it could have been more actioner,this movie was great watching it as a kid. the only thing that bugged me abaout this movie was how it was on a military base and the soldiers were all limted to a small amount of ammo. and after being in the military in a while i see movie flaws but i wont go into that. i still love this movie though.
4,Science Fiction with a BRAIN!,"The best thing about this flick is that it does not insult the audience. We are told enough to be both scared and fascinated by the alien, but we are not really told HOW to feel. Instead, we experience things that excite feelings and thoughts without taking away our involved choices. Most movies like this are insulting: The alien is presented as EVIL or MISUNDERSTOOD or some such silly generalization. This alien is REALLY COOL: intricate, unique, intelligent and just plain amazing. It is also morally neutral as a grizzly bear. It wants to survive and so on. This is so refreshing given all the insipid, canned monster-moralizing to which we are usually subjected. A sequel would be nice if it extends this film with integrity like the Alien sequels have done."
2,This movie isn't that great.,"I was an extra in this movie, and I was really excited to see it in the theatre. But I was really disappointed. I thought it was a dud. But some people like it, so maybe it's me..."
5,"Nice, objective effort","Celmins pretty much lays out such facts as he could glean from acquaintances. The dismal story of how the shrinks blew apart Green's nervous system is not told, probably because Celmins couldn't find them or couldn't get them to talk. Celmins does not write the introduction to this third edition, so he may not even be with us anymore (Alan Clayson has the duty now). Well written and a fascinating read because the reader must decide. My take is that Green ran out of ideas prior to leaving the business, and attempted to counter his depression with acid. Once the wise ones administered electro-shock, it was really the end of Green as a composer."
5,Must Have Album,"Wow...I was blown away by this album. I came across this band from being a Third Watch fan, and I can't stop listening to their music. Vocals and music come together to give a wonderful folk rock sound. ""Maeve"" is the most beautiful song I have ever heard. Skipp Sudduth's voice on this song takes it to a whole other level. It's worth buying this album just for this song. However ""Carry Me"" is also a wonderful song. Listen to it just to hear the instrumental solo from the 3:39 minute mark. It is awesome. I think it is the folk rock equivalent of a Led Zeppelin or Gun's 'N Roses guitar riff. Buy this album today, you will definitely not be disappointed. I can't stop listening to it and have added it to one of my all time favorites."
1,This album is very bad,"This album is just screaming song after song. I like music where there is some melody to it and I can understand what the lead singer is singing throughout the album. I used to like them because of their music video scrape. That is the only good song on this album. This band has not real talent at all. How hard is it to scream throughout a song?. Not very in my opinion. This is not music, this is just noise throughout the whole album. Stay away from this if you like music that is nice."
4,A very good substitute for inflamming deodorants,"Why is this middle-aged man buying a baby care product for himself?Some time ago, I developed a skin irritation from using a hypoallergenic underarm deodorant. I switched to an all natural product that worked for a year,until it too caused a skin irritation. An on-line hunt for a safe substitute lead me to several helpful hints. All concurred that a combination of baking soda and corn starch would be a safe replacement for underarm deodorant. Because I travel a lot, I need an efficient ""storage and delivery system"" for this concoction. More Googling brought me to this Avalon product and,while I found it pricey, it was the solution I was looking for. I have been using it for several weeks now and I am pleased that it is an effective and safe deodorant.Silky Cornstarch Baby Powder 2.50 Ounces"
4,a nice trip down memory lane,"A great and informative read for any fan of hiphop and it's history. The only thing that is ""off"" about it, is the slightly weird ending. When we come close to Eazy's death the story abruptly stops and we get a long chapter about the authors past. A lot is left unsaid about the circumstances surrounding Eazy E's death."
4,Pretty Good,"It was a cool book that gave me some insight into what was going on behind the scenes. Most of the stuff about NWA I knew because I was a huge fan. A interesting book the only bad part was about 3 chapters when he slipped in his personal life but I guess he had to let people know about where he came from I skipped over some of that stuff because I didn't really care but I would suggest this book to everyone that was fan of Eazy & NWA & westcoast ""Gangsta Rap"""
1,Eazy-E fans don't support this book,"It is well documented that Heller was the reason Cube and Dre left NWA. But it later emerged Jerry Heller was stealing from Eazy E. This is an account from BG Knocc Out moments before Eazy headed to hospital. ""The last time I went into the hallway the man was in there by himself sittin' on the floor wheezing, like terribly. And I was like, ""You alright?"" I sat down next to him, and he was tryin' to talk, and he had this big manila envelope in his hand, pulling out these faxes and all this stuff. He had records from where money was missing from the label - millions of dollars that he said Jerry was stealing from him. And Jerry was sending him idle threats - faxes and stuff like that.""That night he took Eazy to hospital for the last time. Anyone who is a fan of Eazy E or NWA DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."
3,Jerry is out to settle the score.................,"Jerry Heller aka Mr. Rourke is out to settle a few scores with Suge, Cube and Dre. The read is very laughable when he discredits Cube and Dre's gangsta reputations. My beef is with the way he claims Eazy E as a adopted son and protoge, then towards the end of the book, he discloses some very private information about Eazy's death. I found it disgusting for a person who claims to have had so much love for Eazy to do that."
3,Follow-up movie....,I didn't see the first movie so missed some of the back story. Exceptional acting here and very touching performance by Janet Jackson. Good values and practical information for marrieds. Tyler Perry is a master at what he does - all different things - and this is one of the best.
3,Over The Top,"I enjoy Tyler Perry's work and after seeing Why Did I Get Married, of course I had to see the follow-up. The story line was ok but the character Angela was just too much and too loud! No one would be married to this woman and why should spouses give each other their cell or email passwords. Just because you are married doesn't mean you can't have privacy...it's called TRUST!! Husbands, wives, and couples in a committed relationship should stay out of each others purses, wallets, and electronic devices. I'm married and my husband NEVER answers my phone. One time my phone was ringing and I asked him to get it for me, he said let it go to voice mail. If you want to check your spouse's cell, just get a detailed bill. I assume most married people are on the family plan anyway."
2,So the 1st movie was great but this one just shows a few things ....,one yes people forget what they learned and go back to there old ways. So sometimes they must learn again but the movie was not believable the 2nd time thru and was overplayed quite a bit.Next the ending of the movie was VERY bad story telling and was not fond of the movie I feel it could have been done much better than it was so that is why I gave it a 2 out of 5I did like the first movie and would give it 5 stars but when you have a 5 star and deliver a 2 star film that is bad.shame shame
5,WHY DID I GET MARRIED TOO,"One of the best (and maybe the best) Janet Jackson's performance in a film. In a scene, she looks like her dead brother Michael like never. Very good film and actress performance."
3,overplayed,success sprouts triteness with rapidly produced projects. Perry needs to go back to the drawing board
1,sucks,only played to chapter 4 and Amazon had to refund me.. booohohoooo. will not buy from them again. did not even respond to my email
5,Another Masterpiece of Tyler Perry,"Get ready for laughs, then get them tissues ready ladies. Tyler Perry is on the roll, he's blessed no doubt there!"
2,Terrible!,"This movie is absolutely ridiculous and the only reason I gave it two stars was for the pretty scenery while they're in the Bahamas. I seriously could not believe this movie and truly wanted to stop watching, but like witnessing a train wreck, I could not pull myself away. Honestly, after the first movie that seemed to end with some redeeming qualities about marriage, I thought this one would continue in the same vein, but this was just a marriage basher. After watching this, why would anyone think marriage is a good thing? Two couples have major trust issues, another one has a wife on the verge of an affair, and the last one, the Janet Jackson marriage is beyond awful. Her character, which always seemed the somewhat calm one, turns into this raging lunatic who wants a divorce for reasons we never know. All in all, please skip this tragically horrible movie. It's not worth the time!"
1,Disappointed - not as good as the first one.,Just finished watching it and I was so disappointed. Too much negative drama. I expected it to have more funny moments and less over the top drama. The ending was SO DISAPPOINTING!
1,Do not waste your money,"Feeble attempt to rip off the first movie. Do not waste your time or money unless you like watching mean-spirited, bitter films."
2,Not for me,"Way too sad and depressing. Not entertaining at all. Can't believe that this movie has been rated as 4 stars. The first one was much better.Hopefully this is the end of the ""Why did I get married"" films."
1,I hope this is the last of the series...,"This movie seemed rushed and so unlike Tyler Perry. It is truly my least favorite of all of his movies. I almost walked out of the theater...to me, it was just that bad and there is NO comparing this movie to ""Why Did I Get Married"". There was no need for a sequel if it was going to be so terrible."
2,Not what I thought,"While there are areas of humor in this movie, it is not really a comedy. The ending is bizzare as well. I did not much care for it"
4,great movie for anyone in a relationship or who has had a realtionship,this movie is great it has everything thats real in todays realtionships... any girl would love this movie not only does it have some great eye candy but it also has real issues we go through and real outcomes. i definitely recommend this movie to others even my partner enjoyed watching this.
4,Like it but didn't Love It..,"This was a Good Movie , but like all Tyler Perry Movies they need more development. Wasn't as Good as I thought it would be , but it's worth watching..."
2,Too Many Cliches. Not Impressed...,"I'm generally a supporter of Tyler Perry productions. That being, the plays, and the TV shows. The movies for some reason never do it for me. Why Did I Get Married was not bad. The sequel for me, failed miserably. For one the intense comic relief along with the supercharged drama doesn't blend well for me (i.e. Madea Goes to Jail - the movie) The plot was all too predictable, ex wants the ex back, hubby and wife aren't happy, they argue and tragically one dies..meehhhh.... oh, let's not mention, one has cancer and it's not addressed at all other than when it's mentioned..It just seemed like a mash up of a bunch of recycled movie plots, all put together crudely. Hmm, just didn't sit well with me at all. Sorry."
5,good movie,brought back some painful memories but got some healing while watching this dvd. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has lost a loved one.
3,It was just o.k.,I gave it three stars because Janet Jackson was good. 5 stars for her.3 stars for her and the whole movie. Tyler Perry is using the same material. Nothing changed. Angela in the airport acting like a fool was really dumb. But Janet was awesome. I loved her. Other than that I can do without.
2,Scratchy,"This item I bought was scratchy in the middle of the film. The disk never finished a specific scene and jumped-skipped to another scene. I never received the first copy I ordered though said it was shipped, so a kind woman from Amazon.com sent me another w/o charge or shipping."
5,I love this pan,"I love this pan. It is one of my favorite cookware pieces. Whenever I need a large pan, this is it. It's nice and heavy, heats quickly and cooks evenly. It don't have any problems with food sticking to it so cleanup is easy. The lid is made of glass, so I can see how my food is cooking and I can put the whole thing in the oven when I need to.Large and durable, I've had this pan for years and cooking surface is still in great condition."
1,Drop the Book and Run,"Keep running if you are handed this book. Not much between the covers. Sure the story sounds interesting, but somehow that does not translate to what is actually written. To many stereotypes, I mean it was really funny after awhile. I gave it 150 pages then had to give up."
5,"If you've been there, the connection is immediate....","This film tells the story of the early life of G.I. Gurdjieff originally expressed in the book of the same name...which is also brief; concise; and filled with hints....tracks extremely well with the Ouspensky books....This movie was made in the 70s....the special efx are incredible considering the time of production....Does it really give you what you want??? Well....no more than the Starr report.... BUT, for those who can see beyond the 30 frames per second....yes....and more. Almost 20 years later, I've ordered a copy. I spent more than 5 years in a WORK school in the 70s. The movie is as close as it gets without being there. A fine tribute with typical limitations....by that I mean this movie, of course, failed at the boxoffice....what do you expect???? But if you've been there....the connection is immediate.The WORK is out there...."
1,A hilarious movie! Gurdjieff was a babbling buffoon!,Don't buy this silly nonsense. Gurdjieff must have been related to Rasputin! Hahahah what a comedy!
4,Needs better supports - but good product.,"Good product. Solidly built. It is sagging on the wall, with the belts on it. The drywall anchors are not strong enough to hold it securely."
4,"yep, this is a tie rack","For such a low price, you can't really find fault with a metal tie rack. It's easy to install and does not appear poised to fall apart any time soon. Provided you don't need a premium-quality rack, this one does the trick."
2,bad stuff,The rack is not really for belts and heavy stuff.. I ve got mine with some belts and is a mess to try to slide it..
2,Poor design.,"The sliding feature of this rack causes it to mount very loosely on any surface, so it's tough to rely on it to hold much more than a few belts or ties. The spacing of the hooks is also horrible because they are too close together for belts to fit nicely one to a hook and they are too wide for the belts to fit over two of them. Your only option is to run the belt down through the hook and let the buckle catch on the top which is not terribly convenient or even useful."
2,cheap slide,"Nice shiny piece on the outside. The track underneath is just a strip of plastic. You could get away with this for some lightweight stuff, otherwise it will lean and wear the plastic."
2,"Looks great, but...","I bought this watch because I wanted a watch that didn't have a leather strap but still looked cool. And it does. Unfortunately, the clasp on the band is a one size only thing, and it was a little big on me (and I'm not a petite person). It wasn't so bad that it fell off, but enough that I would often have to turn the watch to see the time. Also, after a while, the clasp started getting loose and it would pop open with more frequency. So it looked cool, but I had to worry about it coming apart. I eventually replaced it with something else."
5,memories,"Over the past 10 years I have tried to duplicate my 8 track collection to cd. I had over 2000 to convert. I was down to 3 figuring these would never be found. ZAZU for the longest time was not available in cd. Then one day, BAM, there it is. I anxiously awaited for the arrival, looking in the mailbox daily, just like a little kid. Upon arrival, I immediately loaded up the stereo and played ZAZU on 50% volume (expensive stereo). Just as I remembered. The cd starts out slow and mellow about enough time to blow off a number. Each selection thereafter increases in intensity. An outstanding mix bringing you from nice average to a floyd type finish. Sad they only cut 1 album. But I have it, and my collection is almost complete."
1,Item not as pictured,"I bought this for my DCO7, which it clearly shows on the packaging in the photo. However, I was sent a very cheap looking generic filter for a DC05/08/14/15. Amazon stated they could not control 3rd party sellers, even though they were the processing agent on this item (I bought it using my Prime account). BUYER BEWARE."
1,Not even close!,"This item lists as a replacement for the DC14 pre-filter. It's not even close in form factor. Not terribly expensive, so it's not worth packing up and shipping back. What do I do with it now? Guess it's going in the trash. :("
1,Wrong size,I was not aware my dyson took a larger filter. I bought 2 of these because they were so much less expensive than going directly to dyson. I'm now stuck with them as sending back is more trouble than it's worth
2,Really does not fit,"Dyson DC41 motor, does not fit.Looks like a good design, but the dimensions are off by enough to make it unusable for that model."
4,13 Years Of Forced Reality by skinchick,"This CD's got catchy lyrics,a hard,powreful sound that sticks in your brain well after you've heard it.This CD is standing amongst the best Oi!streetpunk bands out there today.Get this CD if ya' haven't gotten it already!"
4,"Live, Loud and Punk","This is a recording of the Anti-Heros live performance at the Beer Olympics last year. Every song rocks hard and the recording quality is great too. If you like the raw energy of live street punk, you'll love this."
5,not whitepride/power,Forced Reality was never or presently white pride/power. Thet were never on a comp called white pride world wide.
4,Delicious as ever,"The ""Chocolate"" books continue to be a delicious way to sit back and fill up with stories that delight and fulfill. I recognize myself and the women in my life in each of these delightful stories. What a treat to invite these wonderful women into my home like a cherished group of old friends! Like their namesake indulgence, these stories might not be the most ""sensible"" reading a girl could do, but they are certainly some of the most satisfying . . .Adrienne Wiley, editor of the upcoming book ""For This I Am Grateful"" from Everyday Wisdom Press."
1,Chocolate for a Woman's Spirit,"Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I was disappointed in this book. There were definitely a few excellent stories in it, but it contained too many that seemed to be written by women who had messed up their lives and were trying to sugar -coat (or chocolate-coat) their mistakes, rather than amend them. Perhaps I was comparing it too much to an incredible book I finished recently, ""Small Miracles"" by Yitta Halberstam and Judith Leventhal. In that book, practically every story moved me deeply. However, much as I love chocolate, the ""Chocolate"" stories were a disappointment."
4,Playing the opponent,This is a very good book for an intermediate player who wants to know how to play the opponent and the situation rather than playing only what is on the board.He sets the situation and the opponent for each sample game and lets you in on how he modifies his game as he plays it.Tim Holland was a former world champion and backgammon pro. (Defined by bridge pro Skid Simon as someone who plays for higher stakes than he could afford if he were a losing player.)
2,Communicable Diseases,"This is a great classic book, but it turns out that I was sent a really old version (like 1976) when I thought I was ordering a 1997 version from the description on the Amazon site. I'm sure it said 1997, so I think Amazon made the mistake."
5,"Rich characters, great escape","THE PUZZLE BARK TREE is a delight. I found myself taking my time reading it, not wanting it to end. The characters are richly detailed, and although I didn't relate to their circumstances, I could relate to THEM. I fell in love with some of them and truly despised some of them. The focus of the book is around Grace, and I found myself grieving with her, being confused with her, loving with her and hating with her. You will create your own perfect cabin on an island as you escape into the lush settings. Stephanie Gertler has written a great follow up to the wonderful JIMMY'S GIRL, which I also loved."
5,One of a kind!!!,"As always, Andre and his orchestra are the best. I have 17 DVD's from Andre Rieu and this is one of my favorites, extremely romantic and melancholic. Definitely I recommend it."
3,NTSC or PAL?,"DVD Love around the world is overpriced for the content.It didn't mention if NTSC or PAL?PAL?. It was PAL and I live in the USA.Very unhappy customer. Had to buy a DVD player NTSC/PAL, no regrets for the purchase of the DVD player."
4,WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE,"Okay, since confession's good for the soul I'll admit it- I'm a bathroom bandit. If there's a new potion, lotion, jar or bottle on the guy counter in our bathroom, I can't resist taking a sniff, then maybe a dab, and (sad to say) even appropriating same. Such was the case with Cosmetic Lad from Lush.Of course, it's geared for guys but, believe me, it's also great for gals. This yummy smelling cream softens skin and keeps those disobedient wisps of hair in place. It's particularly soothing after being in the sun or exposed to wintry blasts.The fragrance is fresh, clean, fruity (smells great on men). Healing and smoothing ingredients in the cream are Shea butter, cocoa butter, and aloe vera gel. For good measure the formula also includes chamomile, lavender honey, almond oil, and wheatgrass.Yep, what's good for the goose delights the gander."
2,not for me,"I love the Lush products. They are unique, they work, and the ingredient list makes sense to a layperson such as myself. I'm sure this works well for other men and women. They recommended it to me at the Lush store for sensitive skin. However, the scent actually gives me a headache. It isn't strong, but it is pervasive. I can smell it on my face the whole day. I've tried skipping days in case it was something else bothering me, but even after going a month, and then using it, bam, there's the headache. It's too sweet, or too something. I'm going to return it and try the Skin Drink stuff, or something else, because I really do love the Lush line, but oh my word do I hate this one. Also, it make my face feel like it had a skin mask on it all day, as well. It just kind of laid there; I could feel it all day. Sounds like it's lovely for others, but keep it away from me."
2,"Not much of the substance, a lot of fluff","Maybe one architect made a favor to another architect, and they convinced another academic architect, who had some say with a famous publisher, to publish the book with not much of substance (kind of the Emperor's New Clothes tale), but graphically excellent on beautiful paper using very good technology and printing dyes?"
5,OOOOooooOOhHHh... SCARY!,"These guys rock... fun, catchy surf-punk/glam-rock hybrid. Braxus Bane rocks out, and the rest of the kooky kids in this band are pretty fun too. Buy this album if you are looking for a knee-slappin' ghoulish time."
3,"Entertaining, but not light and fluffy.","To avoid the advances of a villainous local squire, Miss Claire Barrington enters into a marriage of convenience. The groom, however, signs his twin brother Jasper's name to the marriage documents. As Claire and Jasper sort out the legalities of their situation and their feelings for one another, the evil squire and other malicious characters plot against them.There is a rape scene in this book. And the rapist doesn't die a horrible, excruciating death at the end. I think the author needs to rewrite that. Or maybe editors will keep rape scenes out of style and leave them out of romances all together, please."
1,My most hated book so far for 2009,"Adrienne Basso, was fast becoming my favorite author until this book. It was riddled with a plot that was so predictable and worse of all bad. She took two women who were abused by their father and turn them into women to be hated. She showed no compassion towards her characters and their pain. This book has not even been donated to goodwill but has been thrown away where it belongs in the garbage"
2,You might enjoy it the first time around...,"This is the kind of movie that you watch and get a bit drawn into, all the while thinking, this is pretty good because you are not expecting much having never heard of it. You might even finish the movie thinking, ""yeah, that wasn't bad."" But I would say it is also the kind of movie that given a 1/2 hour to digest what you just saw, you will likely come to the conclusion that, in fact, it was pretty bad.The movie is overdone, from start to finish. I like Sean Bean but he has a tendency to overact and overact he does; but I can overlook that since, somehow, he is still interesting to watch. The visuals surrounding what it may have felt like during a plague was pretty good; but there really wasn't anything particularly good about the story and the ending, which some describe as a surprise, seemed pretty predictable to me.Overall, it's not a waste of time to watch the movie but it is definately not a movie I would ever watch again."
3,Not Bad for what it's Worth,"Low budget film but the acting was top notch. I love Sean Bean and he did great in movie. Christian vs. Pagan; Neo-Christianity vs. Enstablishment; all done rather poorly. Clearly not meant to be a true historical fiction, but rather enjoyable."
2,Just watch the original Wicker Man....,"....it's a much better, more suspenseful, and compelling tale. Black Death doesn't have that ""grab you and keep you enthralled"" storytelling, and is poorly woven together, although in a few scenes there are delicious bits of irony that keep this movie from being a total waste of time. Save your money - you'll be glad you did."
4,"Dark, yet re-affirming.","It re-affirms my atheism; my belief in non-belief, if you will. Sure, yes, it's just a movie, but it is a historical fact that for about 20 centuries, jerk-wad x-ians have been, shall we say, less than awesome when dealing with people that they don't like, or who make them uncomfortable, or who challenge their mythological dogma, or who, for that matter, eat red meat on Fridays. Atheists, Pagans, Wiccans, whomever, I'm going to pull for them as opposed to x-ians any day. And the actress who played the de facto leader of the village was s-m-m-mokin' hot. On a side note, the world didn't end today. Imagine that."
1,Sucks,"Nothing to see here folks, move along. Everyone associated with this turd should repent. If I could but give zero stars, my lord.I see that 0 of 7 people found my review helpful. I bet at least 6 of those 7 come back and say I was right; I already told you all you need to know. This turd is cooked."
4,DARK KNIGHTS,"The brutality and blind ignorance of 14th century Europe is grimly explored in BLACK DEATH.It is 1438 and the horrifying bubonic plague is decimating villages with no mercy. A band of mercenary knights has been commissioned to find out why one small village is not being ravaged by the plague. They believe that an evil and powerful necromancer is protecting them. A young monk who has violated his vows of celibacy is assigned to lead them to this village where he grew up. What ensues is a bleak, violent and grim journey into the fear and religious paranoia that dominated these dark ages.BLACK DEATH is a disturbing and visceral experience, well-crafted movie but not an uplifting one. The performances are uniformly excellent especially from Sean Bean as the fiercely devoted Ulrich; Eddie Redmayne's torn monk Osment; and Carice van Houten as the beautiful but deadly necromancer.BLACK DEATH pulls no punches and its dark vision is deeply thought-provoking."
4,A BLAKE BUT HISTORICALLY RICH FILM,A deeply dark tale of a young monk who leads some religious mercenaries to find out why a particular marsh village hasn't been affected by the Black Death. There are some fine performances and the costumes and setup give it an overall gritty yet dark view of surrounding area. Combat is vicious and especially brutal. The ending had a nice but macabre twist to it. Keep in mind this is more of a psychological study about human beings than some action packed tale. Sean Bean does a good enough job but Eddie Redmayne (the red headed kid from PILLARS OF THE EARTH) and Carice van Houten have the best performances. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; MOOD/THEMES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday.
2,End was dissapointing,preview looked interesting and it was living up to being a decent film until the end. The end is rushed to completion leaving the rest of a decent movie to suffer.
4,Sad results,Goes to show how people tend to war in the name of religion. How ones views can change a person's views that they don't understand or refuses to understand.
3,Mid-evil movie about the plague and bringing back the dead. Not my kind of movie but I liked it. Brutal in parts. I say B-,"Are somethings are too good to be true? Set in the time of the Black Plague, there is a rumor that one village has found a way to bring back the dead. Ulrich (Bean) and Osmund (Redmayne), lead a group to see if the rumors are true. I should start off by saying that but for a few exceptions I have never really liked movies set in the Dark/Mid-evil ages. This is not a bad movie at all, just a little too slow moving for me. I was expecting this to be a little more of a horror movie then it was. The acting is a little flat, but I have seen much worse. This movie is worth watching, but don't expect anything amazing. Not really too much to say about this one. If you like this style of movie I think you would love it. If your like me, you will still enjoy it. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - Probebly not"
2,Death to Black Death,"Quality actors in a very poor movie. Not much of a plot and the story goes nowhere. I enjoy a good sword fight, but gore for gore's sake leaves me flat. I liked the premise of ""is she a witch or isn't she?"" and how she plays with the mind of the monk. However, the ending of the movie just seems tacked on and is pointless. Visually, I hoped for better as well. The camera angles are pedestrian, rarely leaving eye level, and the heavy use of hand-held shots made me want to turn the movie off. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,so-so,A depressing little slasher-film with an underdeveloped philosophical question fortunately dressed-up with finebritish actors obviously earning their money.
1,What are you kidding?,"This was likely one of the most unfocused stories, misguided tales and poorest movies it has been my displeasure to fork over dineros and shekels to watch.As they say in the Navy, ""hard to port"", ""hard to port"", avoid this movie and wasting your time on it at all cost. I will simply say it is without a storyline, dark, cynical, un-uplifting, and just plain poorly done on likely a budget of millions of Euros. Amazing what crap comes out of some folks minds.Surely, the producers and directors of this masterpiece of mediocrity must just know how bad this flick and story are in reality?Save yourselves from this movie, Jesus is tired, save yourselves, run for the exits or better yet, don't enter the dark and ridiculous world of this movie."
3,bad picture quality too,the movie is ok..you like it or not...i want to say that the picture quality is very grainy and far to be the best i've seen on blu ray.In those conditions don't spent much for blu ray and go SD dvd..my opinion.
5,One does not simply walk into a marsh in England.,This is Sean Bean reprising a role that he has made famous. He is the Sword wielding captain of the guard. He is a formidable foe against any necromancer and a man of God. This is a movie that is very real to the true power of the church during the days of the black plague. This is a must own movie for those that appreciate the historical realities.
3,Better than average but slow at times,The movie Black Death had overall good acting and scenery but was a little slow at times for an action movie.
3,Not for the children or the squeamish,"This is a nice little story with some interesting two dimensional characters. I liked the acting as well. It has one or two surprises and will make you a believer. If you do see the movie, you will understand what I mean. I wanted that witch to die so badly and pretty much everyone in that whole town to bite the dust. I know some will feel that the investigators should be ones to die. The story was okay, with good action scenes, good gory make up, nice mystery, tension and even a little love and romance. If it had a deeper meaning it was lost in all the noise as there was no clear theme as far as I could reckon. So should you pay to see it or wait for it to make network television? I am leaning towards waiting, either way though, there is a good chance you will find it entertaining."
3,A Refreshing Change,"This is one of those dirty and disturbing movies. It really makes you shudder. The movie gives a detailed outlook on how life was like in the Middle Ages. It also shows what the plague looked like and what people thought it to be. This movie will surprise you it is unique in that way, but I do not want to give away anything. Just take my word for it and watch the movie! Also if you are a fan of Sean Bean or the Middle Ages/plague then you will love this movie."
4,Nice Surprise,"I honestly had never heard of this film before seeing a preview on Video On Demand. Being a fan of Sean Bean of Lord of the Rings fame, I gave it a try. Set in Europe during the time of the Black Death, this film has Christian knights searching out a village that has not felt the touch of the plague. To guide them they enlist a young monk who has broken his vows and fallen in love with a woman. The story involves their journey and what they find when they reach this village looking for a witch or necromancer. Well acted with great characters. This is a dark story and a wonderfully recreated period piece. This is not a feel good movie, it is gloomy and sticks with you after you have watched. This is a nice find."
4,Great Movie!!,"Ignore the bad reviews on this one, I wish I would have. I passed by this one at least 10 times because I had heard from a few different people that it was a dud. They are the same kind of people who have a taste for the more typical mediocre action hollywood films. Probably the best movie I have seen since Inception. May be offensive to overly sensitive Christians and Pagans."
2,A 'slow death' watching this,"This isn't the worst ""knights killing in the name of God"" film I've seen, but its pretty dull to watch. And with that said, what is it with poor Sean Bean? I love him but he has not made a good film in a long time. He & David Warner are the reason I watched this film in the first place but Warner has a small role and Sean Bean's talent's seem wasted. This movie seems to come to an accdeptable ending but then goes on for several more minutes with a surviving character carrying out vengence on other innocents that seems to make no sense. Not a complete waste of time for a film, but not good either."
3,The Blinding Truth of Religion,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodHandsomely filmed & acted medieval drama about the hypocrisies of religion. In this case, Christianity & Paganism, involving God's wrath through the Bubonic plague, & a village that has been left untouched by it. So the Bishop's soldiers go to investigate for witchcraft.A text book example of how religion breeds ignorance & blindness to ones surroundings, & how both religions end up dealing with the other in the same sadistic ways. A true analogy to today's environment, & yesterday's, & tomorrows.""Black Death"" is an involving drama, & I highly recommend it, but just barely falls short of being a classic of the genre."
3,"Sean Bean 5 stars, Movie 3 stars","The movie had an interesting story line and ending, which I will not give away here. Sean Bean, in my opinion, rescues this movie from a mediocre supporting cast."
4,Eddie Redmayne & Sean Bean,Eddie Redmayne was captivating in The Pillars of the Earth. He delivers again in Black Death. Everything about this film feels right.
5,My kind of movie!!!!,"This is another movie i rented on Zune on Xbox 360 first,and all i got to say,is this is movies that i enjoy watching.I love movies set back in time,esp in the crusades.This movie stays dark,and is just one of those movies you get hooked in to!!!!Check this one out!!!!!"
5,Great insights,Who would've thought that Jenna's story could have a happy ending. I hope to hear more from her and how current events have impacted her business.
3,Very honest,An entertaining look inside this industry. Jenna is very open and has been through good and bad times and came out alive.
1,Bad porn,"Book starts off great, an easy and interesting read. Then seems to deteriorate as if Jemma ran out of material. Tons of dialogues that makes no sense at all."
5,Read w/ Caution,"Any one who is interested in buying this book better have alot of free time on their hands. I say this because once you start to read this book, you won't be able to put it back down until you reach the very last page. ""how to..."" is an autobiography of Jenna Jameson, with out boring you she tells the story of her life and career in great detail , but also grabs your attention by at least one picure for every two pages.... I'd recomend this book to anyone who loves her, as well as any one who may not even had heard of the wonderfull woman who is Jenna Jameson."
2,Not what I expected,Don't let the title fool you. I knew prior to buying this book that is was going to be about her life but I expected her to give more details about the industry itself. If you want to learn what really goes on behind the scenes this is not the book for you.
3,"Good book, bad subject...","Honest depiction of the sex industry, but very depressing. Basically this book outlines the reasons that I stopped going to strip clubs many years ago: Sad people who view their customers with contempt. This should be required reading for every adult male at the age of 16 years old."
4,wow!,"this book pulls no punches. It is an honest account of an all too secretive business. not exactly coffee table material but well worth a look if you're so inclined. Packed with photos, as you'd expect. Fascinating story written naturally."
4,one of those books..,"The story begins with stripper hanging from her shower, dead. And from there, it doesn't let up.This is one of those books that are just impossible to put down. From the first few pages to the very end you are just hooked. As you read this book its more like one of your best friends telling you a story.Other thing that was really fun it was the section on how to become a male porn star: I had no idea. There are short comic books throughout the book that are really high-quality and funny (especially the suitcase pimp one). And Jenna's story is really."
2,Worse than Dirt,"Neil Marcus was most at ease with the Motley Crue or Marylin Manson. The quite boring and ordinary ragz to richez story of a white trash curvacioues baby doesn't explore at all the sex magazine or movie industry or world. All the characters are quite plain and without depth. But, perhaps, most readers will be happy just with the photo of this beautiful lady."
3,Good story...I recommend it.....,This book was put together well and I really enjoyed thestory..the author told the story with flair...this bookreally held my attention. The sex industry is fascinating..Dance to Despair by Rebeckka Sathen Black blew me away..Unbelievable ..... check it out..great
1,As slimy as you would expect,"Many people have had rough lives, but do not demean themselves for money the way this person has. Prostitutes are prostitutes, no matter what they may call themselves. I think any thinking person who even lays a hand on this highly prosaic, overlong, prurient, dreary, self-pitying tome will probably feel the need to have a long shower afterward to excise the dirt."
5,helped entice my sex with my husband,i abosultely love this book. towards the end of the book she gives really good details on certain sexual positions to add 'spice' to sex. Believe me they work. this is definitely a must read. never a dull moment.
1,A Crock Tale,"I can only hope that inquiring minds will save their diginity, time, and money by avoiding the ramblings of someone who adds exasperation to their perilous condition by blaming it on self created calamities of the past and present. This book truly wasn't meant to be a means of ""cautioning"" readers about the perils of the sex industry. What is being offered here though, is a copious amount of icing for the depraved ego of a (...) acctress who is trying to add meaning to, by way of discrediting, her chosen path in life. It is quite apparent to anyone with a rationalized process of thought, that the (fictionalized) insanity in Jenna's life is a self serving venture. It creates intrigue, then the intrique give birth to fame, and the fame helps to build Jenna's cash pile and ego stock. Geee Jeanna, what an ingenious marketing idea at the expense of the soul!!"
5,Amazing!,"This book is the definitly one of the best books I've ever read. Not only was I suprsied about some of the stuff I heard, I believe the way this book was put together just shined. I would really recommend this book to anyone, your going to be in for a couple of shocks! Very Recommened!"
2,Depressed,"I could not help but feel somewhat depressed after reading this book. I found her life story to mirror what I have always thought a porn stars life would be - sad and empty. As much fame and attention Jenna craves, in the whole scheme of things, she has few people who truly love and care for her. All the so-called ""Stars"" and every day people she meets only want one thing from her and it is not her pleasant personality. She was and still is being degraded and looked down upon, yet she tries to expound upon how she did things her own way in the porn world. Dignity and respect are two things lacking in Jenna's life. How sad."
2,a tad disappointing,"Perhaps I expected much too much from Ms. Jameson, but I was a tad disappointed after reading her book.I was initially interested in her portrayal of herself; as a business woman, as an individual. I felt that she didn't describe herself as either of these, and instead relied too heavily on the mundane, average occurances and habits that she has in common with too many other Americans.I thought that there was soo much attention paid to her drug use and abuse, and not enough attention paid to her ability and drive to overcome life's challenges.She came off not as the intelligent, sexy, strong, business-savvy gal I had thought she was; but as an average girl who came upon her current place in life simply by chance. I think that I actually lost some respect for her because of her book, instead of gaining any."
1,Too sad for words.,"I thought this book might just be fun to read, but it was awful. What a tragic life. I was so depressed."
4,Great read,"A new found respect for porn stars and the industry, this book is an interesting look into the life of Jenna Jameson"
3,Interesting,"Reading this was engaging. I felt like I was listening to an old friend speak about her life. In essence, while the content was interesting, the writing was not breath taking or anything special. It's just an interesting life story.Another thing that I didn't love about this book is all the name dropping. I'm sure this part appeals to people who are really into the porn film industry or something, but for me it was just like reading name after name of people I had never heard of. I bought the book to learn what Jenna Jameson is about, not learn random tidbits about other semi-famous people."
3,Not the most brilliant reading,"Book arrived on time and in good condition, I was excited to read the book after all the amazing reviews here, however I found it an average reading.. I did not expect sex advises in it, because other readers have mentioned there arent any there. However I was expecting something more hot as a reading in terms of more insight of her job and so... If we follow the book we get the idea she has hardly slept with a few carefully selected men(and women) and also have done a few movies, which is not the case. I even found it at some moments quite boring to read how she gets hooked on a guy, alcohol or drugs(sometimes together) and cant let go... it could be just my feeling, but it is that i feel something fake in this book and it was interesting to read how she started and what her life in general was, i just couldnt feel this book as an impressive one.."
4,Interesting read!,A good book overall. Was surprised to learn a lot about Jenna Jamison. Seems that she doesn't hold anything back.
1,Jenna Lameson,"A longtime porn fan I am and I just never understood how this girl became a household name.Then again I think I do...when you got the standard bleached blonde stripper trailer trash look thats become so dominant since porn went Cali & began appealing to rednecks & you sign up with one of the tackiest, bloodless companies in adult film (Vivid) when you kiss scum like Howard Stern's filthy butt endlessly & the media needs something to titilate its jaded but so out of it subscribers...then maybe if you are such a subpar looker/performer like Jenna Fakerson you might just pull it off.If Jenna wrote this book --- badly written, poorly edited and evasive as it is --- I'd be surprized.Want to know the true scoop on the money hungry, racist redneck Jenna?(...)"
1,So Many Good Books Out There....why does this one exist?,"If you are completely blinded to the fact that Hollywood degenerates have taken over the media and are now infiltrating the wonderful realm of literature, than be my guest and add to the insult. With genuine authors abound, I suppose it is quite easy to be drawn into a book like this, but just sit and think about it for a minute. I'm going to give money to someone who's only claim to fame is being a drug-addled adult film slave? Is this really important or pertinent to our lives in any salvageable way? Why do we want to know about this filth, just because there's a glossy cover on it and the chance of nudity? Aren't we as humans deserving of so much more. Just go to your library and see all the amazing novels out there, and please realize that this garbage should only be on one list, the list of worst books ever made."
1,Waste of money,"I found this book offensive to a normal adult mind. I bought what I thought was an autobiography, and what I found was a story full of inconsistency's and stinking of prefabricated BS. I am truly disappointed. It is so sad to see someone that is obviously still looking to be the center of attention to make up for her childhood. Grow up Jenna! The world has many more interesting things to do then cater to your issues. We all have our own issues to deal with. You can't do anything about the way you started out but you can grow up and do something about the way you end up. Find a meeting or see a shrink."
4,Interesting Reading,Rarely does anybody reveal the bare truth the way Jenna Jameson has in this book. She has been honest is what I think in letting the world know what the porn industry is all about. Her life has been one roller coaster ride. One is forced to ponder at the plight of some of the newcomers who want to make it big in this industry but do not realize the cons of this industry. The book should be read for the right reasons.
4,So good,"I've never seen a Jenna Jameson movie. I knew who she was from the Howard Stern show, and enjoyed how she carried herself and how well spoken she was. I was unbelievably moved when i read her book, parts brought me to tears, but at the same time, others made me smile. She is truely a survivor with a fascinating story to tell! A must read for everyone!"
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading Ms. Jameson's autobiography; I've always thought of her as a smart businesswoman. Even though she has more than half a brain, the book is not too articulate.There are so many inconsistencys & it should have been edited down to about half the number of pages. Although I'm sure the large number of pictures in the book were intended to appease her fans, there didn't seem to be a lot of relevancy between them & the chapters they were inserted( the major exception being the wedding pictures-she looks genuinely happy & that is what is expressed in the chapter).If possible, wait for the paperback or borrow the book from a friend, it's not something you'll want to read again & again."
3,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed that the book fell apart the first day I opened it. I think the binding on the soft covered book I purchased was very cheap, so then it was not a good deal. The book was not what I expected but the auto/bio was well written if one really wanted to hear about the family life of Jenna (Jamison)--I didn't. The title was deceiving except for ""A Cautionary Tale"". I should have noticed!! Both the physical book and the content left me feeling duped and out $15.00... oh well, live and learn."
4,How to Make Love Like a Porn Star,Not quite what I expected but still enjoyed it. For the price I got it for was worth it.
5,Suprisingly Good,"I bought his book not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, Jenna Jameson is a porn star, and yes she and other members of her family have done drugs, so if you want to write them off as bad and worthless go ahead, but you won't like this book. Not that I am condoning drugs or sex, but what do you expect the life of a porn star to be like.That aside I think JJ does a great job talking about the mistakes she's made the lessons learned from them. In fact I think certain parts of the book would be beneficial to teen girls and even boys - with all the hormones, change, and new discoverys they have going on in their lives.This book is both very entertaining and very informative, I definately recommend it."
2,Not so good,"I do not like the ""kiss & tell"" at the end. NOT a glamorous or practical life no matter what they do to legitimize it. nNot so interesting afterall."
4,Entertaining,"Not sure I believe every word. Perhaps she's done enough drugs to skew her recollection of events. Regardless, it was an entertaining read."
3,A work of Fiction...or the truth??,"I was intrigued enough to buy this book when I read the many glowing reviews. However, after reading it two things spring to mind:1) Jameson is smarter than many people give her credit for.2) Either she has had the most trying life I know of, or she is a capable embellisher.Most of the 'stories' in this book have the ring ot some truth in them, but I can't help but think that the details have been exagerrated. Come on...her father sat around and did drugs with them, only to then say that the best drug is crank? Her father single-handedly shot over 60 Viet Cong? She was kidnapped by the local mafia while her father was a cop?I enjoyed the book...but I suggest you take it with a LARGE grain of salt."
3,Half is the Truth and Half is a Story....,"Jenna Jameson either can write well for part of this story, or she hired a good ghost writer. If this book is to believed, her family probably should be in jail or in the witness protection program. For me, the stories dealing with her actual life as a porn star are probably the part to sort of believe--she does not seem to be making most of that up. Her story about her family, however, seems totally made up or distorted. At one point, I gave up on her and skipped the chapters dealing with her family, as I could no longer suspend my disbelief.In the end, this book is entertaining, but probably not truthful. Ms. Jameson still has the hustler's code for telling you what you want to hear, but not really believing it herself."
4,Honest Account,"Although the title is provocative and misleading, this is an autobiography of the leading actress of the adult-film industry. We are treated to an honest account of her ups and downs, and an insider's guide to the secret workings of the industry. Often, her intelligence is surprising. The book closes with the very happy prospect for her husband, her pregnancy and motherhood. But we all know better. After this, she miscarried and filed for divorce. It was then a replay of the sad events recounted here. So, here is a girl who desperately wants to be happy but is somehow fated to fail. This is tragic."
2,Dumb,"Not sure what I was expecitng but this was a dumb, boring book. Not at all titillating or very interesting."
5,Great book,Great book. What a life she had growing up. Didn't turn out like I thought. Not much of a reader but this certainly kept me wanting to continue to read.
3,Could she have achieved more in her life without Porn?,A peek in to the world of adult porn and stripping. After reading the book I felt sorry for Jenna as I think she has tried hard to make herself believe that she's a savvy lady who has never been taken advantage of and has always been in control of her life but I believe her story tells a very different tale. Good on her for having the guts to make it work for her and I hope she does or has found the real person inside.
3,it is so so,"If you are getting it for the pictures, just google. The story is not so great either and alll those ""diary entries"" are just annoying and not easy to read. I got this book because i love Jenna Jameson, but the book made me dislike her character in some ways. However, some of the book was hilarious, and some parts were so sad. So it is worth the used price or a rental from a library."
3,Cautionary indeed!,This was a rather racey read for me but interesting in the context of what goes on behind the scenes and what made Jenna who she is.
4,Entertaining.,"I'm a 32 yr old mother of two girls. My heart breaks for Jenna and the sometimes brutal path her life has taken but I'm proud of her for fighting through and rising above the frey. I want to give this 5 stars. I really do. Its a thoughtfully written yet unapologetic autobiography that happens to be easy to read. Its both gut wrenching and humorous, gritty yet fluffy. Just a total contradiction basically. But I enjoyed it from start to finish. This is not a book that glamorizes theporn industry, it is, as the title states 'a cautionary tale'. This is not a book for younger readers-duh- but I think most adults will find it enjoyable overall. There are better, more in depth reviews than mine but I just wanted to add my two cents. I can't give it five stars because to me it would put it on the same level as literary greats. And this is NOT a literary great. It is what it is: the well written auto biography of a stripper turned porn star, deserving of four stars and your time."
3,Its Ok,Gave me more of an understanding of who she is and why she is the way she is. I had a little bit of a hard time trying to get into the book just seemed like a typical porn star biography.
1,Don't really know why I read it.......,"I guess I just wanted to see if she would whine about all the typical things that a typical bimbo sex worker whines about, and wouldn't you know it.....I am kinda so-so on Jenna, sometimes I think she looks okay but then the camera catches her at a not-so-good angle and she has an actually plain kinda face with little eyes. So, eh, I can take her or leave her. Same with this book, I can take it or leave it. I liked the fact that I was gonna hear her story, since I knew what to expect, then when I heard it, it was kinda worse then I even expected. So....I guess the book was not great, IMO. But you know, she is a porn star, I don't expect rocket science and neither should you. She is just kinda.....there. So what."
2,How to Make Love Like a Pornstar ....,"Don't get me wrong, I love Jenna Jameson. I think she is very beautiful, intelligent, a successful businesswoman, and one hell of an entertainer-but this book I found to be very sugar-coated. I often have a hard time believing most auto-biographies and find the best written biographies on celebrities to be written after they are dead (that's when people aren't afraid to speak the truth and nobody can get sued.) For instance, recently published posthumous biographies of Ava Gardner and Robert Mitchum by the very talented Lee Server provided a whole new plethora of interesting and intimate information never before published. I give this book two stars because it provided a lot of somewhat entertaining tidbits and tons of photos which most auto/bios tend to lack."
5,Well written and Provacative,"I read this book in 2 days - I was taken and fascinated with Jenna's story, I could not put the book down. It was well worth every penny spent. I highly reccommend this book to ANYONE - whether you are intersted in the porn industry or a fan of Jenna, this book is a must read. Very, very well written - I gained so much respect for her after reading this book. She is intelligent and a true self made woman."
4,Fascinating.,"I have always wondered why someone would go intuit his business. It is refreshing to hear her story and that she has made the business truly work for her. Se is smart, beautiful and motivated. A good story without a sad ending."
2,some parts were interesting but on the whole a bit boring,"I felt throughout reading the book that she was trying to premote herself or talk herself up too rather than it being an honest biography. It wasn't that interesting and i ended up skipping through about half of the book about her childhood as i just couldnt read anymore. For someone who knows nothing about the porn industry some of it was an interesting read, though i felt like things that may have made her look bad were left out and just couldnt feel sorry for her for most of the things that happened in her life as most of them was her own doing. Didn't really enjoy reading it and would't recomend it to anyone."
3,Interesting read,"I don't know how much of this is true, but interesting nonetheless. Somewhat educational about the industry."
2,MicroStation for AutoCAD users by Conforti,"This book is mostly inadequate for first time users trying to learn MicroStation. Explanations are too perfunctory, and in many cases lacking key information on how to make a specific command work; opting instead to tell you what the command does (if you are lucky enough to eventually figure out how to make it work). Considering the $60 price tag I had to spend for this book, it was a total waste of money."
5,"The perfect guide for the ""bi-directional"" tendencies in you","The is a must-have book for those of us not well versed in both AutoCad and Microstation. It is expecially valuable if you are proficient in one system, and have had some training but not much experience with the other. No matter which way you are approaching from, you are able to understand the instructions by using whichever you are most proficient in. What more can you ask? Simple instructions & good illustrations."
2,ferrari,"I returned it!!! I did not realize it had to be ""built"" or ""assembled"" when i placed the order.Wish it was stated more clearly."
5,Enchanting!,My imagination went wild as soon as I opened this charming book! Did you ever wonder what fairies eat? What kind of clothes do they wear? Where you can find them? This beautifully illustrated book will give you the answers. You can't help but believe! Great fun for children and children-at-heart. I highly recommend!
3,Typical 90s Glitzy Soap Operas,"Great cast. Imagine getting Robert Redford out of a semi-retirement to headline this predictable soaper. Woody Harleson leaped from ""Cheers"" barstool to the big screen and was quite effective as the third wheel in what was a financial deal that went wrong emotionally.Demi Moore is stunning, but was she worth a million bucks for one night? I don't think so. This is a morality play and nothing more. (Or should I say Moore?)Director Adian Lynne has crossed this area before, but not as interesting. The cast is beautiful, the locations are exciting, the performances are top notch. It's the story that only lasts 30 minutes, and the screenplay doesn't challenge the characters."
4,"I'd like to make a proposal,remake the movie with Demi & I !","Demi Moore is a housewife who goes to Vegas with her husband and loses all their money at the casino. A rich tycoon (Redford) offers a proposal. One night in bed with the man's wife (Demi) for a big wad of money. She accepts...however, after the smoke clears, the husband suspects that his wife is still seeing the tycoon & ends up divorcing her. She runs to the tycoon to start a new relationship. Will money buy her the happiness she seeks? Find out for yourself!"
3,"Stupid movie, but surprisingly entertaining","I saw this movie recently, purly because I'm a Robert Redford fan, but I also was curious about this movie. Yes, it is a stupid plot, because what woman would think twice about being paid to have sex with Robert Redford?, but it was surprisingly entertaining. I was shocked that I was able to sit through the whole thing. But, Robert Redford did look handsome, so that helped. I can only recommend this movie to someone that is a Robert Redford fan, because the movie itself is really not that great, though it does make you think - would you have sex with a man you didn't know, with the threat of ruining your marriage, for 1 million dollars? Um, if the man was a billionare and looked like Robert Redford, and I was broke and my husband looked like Woody Harrelson, I know I would."
1,Very Waek,where's the story? Demi Moore&Woody Harrelson can't act and Robert Redford is wooden in this film.this is a film that came out in the wrong deacde.it would have been better in the 80's.Maybe this film will make a Question on how to be a Millionare on Regis? as a bad Joke.
1,"Is it the bad acting, the awful script, or both?","I'll keep it brief. It's trashy, almost physically painful to watch, and embarassing. It's so bad, that I'll even cast it among the ranks of Stargate and Independence Day, which at least had a few pan drippings of ""fun,"" albeit the kind of idiotic fun you feel when you see a movie that should end up in Mystery Science Theater. Save your time and your bucks. Walk away from this dud. Quickly."
5,A Deal With The Devil,This movie portrays a couple's love story where undesirable economic conditons existing in their lives caused the couple to consider gambling with the core of their marriage by submitting to a test of their commitment to each other. All actors performing in this film are exceptional.
3,Interesting but seriously flawed,"INDECENT PROPOSAL is one of those formularized, supposedly heartfelt movies told in one mess of a tale. It starts off with a couple (Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson) struggling to make ends meet and just as they are about to drown in debt, they hit the jackpot in Vegas and then lose all their winnings again. As they are about to hit rock bottom, Robert Redford, a multi-billionaire, comes into their lives to give them a chance to get one million dollars. The catch: Redford ""borrow"" Woody's wife for one night. They agree, but this of course changes the course of their relationship forever. Woody Harrelson is truly miscast in a role too serious for him, making some scenes unintentionally funny. Yet the other two leads help keep this vechicle interesting. Despite the limited success of the script, it remains as a flawed but ambitious work."
3,Starts and ends on the wrong note,"It's an excellent idea - can a marriage survive a Faustian sexual pact with a millionaire? - but in this movie it doesn't work. Perhaps it's because Robert Redford and Demi Moore are not quite right for the parts, or perhaps it's because the dialogue is not sharp enough, but the viewer finds it hard both to figure out what motivates Redford and to sympathize with Moore. The portrayal of the young couple's marriage is fairly convincing, but the ending is bizarre and more appropriate to a Chevy Chase film."

1,Product Review,"There was a mix-up in shipping time and it took longer than expexted. The communication from seller was pretty much non-existant but Amazon did a great job in handling the situation. And, I want to thank Amazon.com for all the help!"
1,NO STARS! Very bad movie....absolutely indecent !!!!,"The idea of a man giving into a million dollar offer to allow his wife a one nighter, with the proposing businessman, is absolutely indecent! This is the core of the story. Because of the married couple's financial woes, the husband feels that the money will save them and is more important than what's really at stake....the union and honor between the two! The film ends with the couple emotionally drained and, subsequently, divorcing (this is no surprise)! This film is a waste of time and is degrading....avoid this movie, indefinitely! It sends out a very immoral message to viewers."
3,How can any female viewer....,"of this movie not be angry about this film? Come on, Robert Redford asks Woody Harrelson to sell him his wife for a million bucks. HELLO? Can't Demi have an opinion on that? In the billiard room scene the two men talk about Demi as if she is some sexual pleasuring device. Plus, there is a microphone in the picture for about 3 minutes.Other then that, the film is entertaining, but that is only because Robert Redford is in it. Brilliant casting, who needs a million bucks reward to sleep with RR, especially when compared to Woody.Demi knows that, Robert knows that and the (female) viewer knows that. Poor Woody marvels what went wrong for a bit too long to come over as at least decent intelligent.Good thing is that we never see Demi and Robert ""doing it"".All in all the movie works in favour of RR, and that is not a bad thing.Yeah, I know my english is bad :)"
2,Seems pretty decent now.,"Indecent Proposal was a shocking film for 1993 but if this film was released now, people wouldn't think much of it. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson portray a young, broke but very much in love married couple who decide to try their luck in Vegas. Robert Redford plays a wealthy, smug man who offers the couple 1 million dollars if he can have one night with his wife, she says yes and the couple's relationship is forever tested. This film appears to be provocative but it falls short, I just couldn't get into this film, very boring and calculated. Skip this one, it's not that steamy."
2,Picture is very deceiving,I bought this chair as a gift for my 13yo son who saw the picture online and said he would like it for his room. The demensions are not right in the description. The chair when assembled measures only 25 inches tall and 32 inches across at the widest part. It would be great for a much younger kid due to the size.
1,awful,This is a poorly structured extremely small chair. Company it ships from is brutal to deal with I returned it and still have not been credtte
4,Saved Money!,"This is the exact torsolette David's Bridal sells for lots more. Just make sure to read the sizing chart, as this does not fit the way a regular bra fits."
3,Loose-Fitting and Shows Under Dress,"Even in a size smaller than what I'd normally buy, this one is too loose on me. The plastic boning is not well-concealed, so it shows under the dress I'm wearing. Even so, it does its job... I needed a corset bra that would work with a ""plunge"" top, and this does make the dress look flattering. So on its own, I'd rate it lower, but when considered for its intended purpose, it works despite the flaws. I'm going to try putting a layer of shapewear over it to camouflage the boning. Still, if I were to do things over, I'd keep looking for a better bra."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!,"I bought this for hopes of wearing it under my wedding gown. I needed something to hold in my lower ""pooch""....well, I read all the other reviews and went down a size in the waist. The cups were way to small, and the main dissapointment was it didn't help hold anything in. I'm not that that huge by any means, 5'6, 120 lbs. It actually make it look bigger, it doesn't come down long enough. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!"
1,Wrong item,"When I ordered this the picture shown was a lace bustier. The one I received was satin. Didn't like it all, returned it."
2,"A few redeeming qualities, if your a big fan of Gang of Four","This is one of those albums that you just have to sigh when you think about. I'm not talking about sighing over its greatness, either. A lot of the songs are silly musically and lyrically, but there are some good songs. It has some cool guitar parts on a few of the songs, but just not enough to capture my attention for very long. I listened to this four times and tried so hard to give it a chance. I got into a couple of the songs, but if you have to skip past most of them, it is a bad sign. 'Cadillac' is a pretty good song, probably the best, and the cover of Bob Marley's 'Soul Rebel' is good too, but I think it could have been better. 'FM U.S.A' is probably one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard. Considering the past history of this band, I just do not understand where they went wrong. If you love them, you should get the albums ""Hard/Solid Gold"" and ""Entertainment!""."
2,Not thier best work,"I picked up this album expecting to enjoy it, like i enjoy ""Shrinkwrapped"" or ""A Brief History Of The 20th Century"". Sadly, this was not the case. Ive tried going back to it after a few months, letting it grow on me, it just never happens. I would suggest buying ANY GOF album besides this one."
4,One of the better Thomas Books,"Not one of the overly preachy Thomas titles, although Percy is made fun of for being afraid of the Dragon. Worth buying because it features the Chinese dragon, which is one of the best and most compelling trains to add to a Thomas collection."
1,Worst children's book I have come across,"Atrociously bad story/plot. Well, there is no story at all. And it is hard to come up with a story on your own, given the illustrations. I would stick with Alison Jay's books anytime."
3,Weak scanning negatives and very noisy,"One of the reasons why I got this scanner (in fact one of the cheapest ones I could find) was the fact that it had a built in feature to allow the scanning of negatives. However doing this has proved to be filled with all sorts of ""traps"" requiring the EXTENSIVE use of image-editing software (such as Adobe Photoshop) to achieve a somewhat acceptable quality.Other than this, it's OK, but this was the most important selling point for this scanner to me, so it hasn't quite met my expectations. Also, I have been hearing the same weird sounds coming from it that another reviewer mentions, so I'm kinda concerned that I will be left with a non-working scanner in a short time."
1,Worthless Warranty,Within the 1 year warranty period the scanner lamp burned out. Not a surprise since it stays on all the time. Microtek took 2 weeks to respond to e-mail and 2 more to process info. They had the nerve to then say the warranty had lapsed!!! They quoted 100-150 for repair and 10 for a box if they didn't like the one you sent it in. All for a scanner ( almost half the price). I'm convinced that they never had any intention of honoring the warranty. And I have no intention of ever buying another product with the Microtek name.
1,I wasted my money on this scanner,"I bought this scanner from Amazon, and while the price was great, the money that I spent on it was completely wasted, since this scanner is not compatible with my computer! I have a COMPAQ PRESARIO 7360, which does not use a Pentium chip, and so my computer does not recognize this scanner. So beware - this scanner is not compatible with all computer, something that Microtek does NOT make the buyer aware of!"
1,Avoid at all costs,"Microtek should be embarrassed to have ever brought such a poorly designed, poorly built scanner to the market. The bulb is unbelievably fragile and can only be replaced by Microtek, shipping prepaid, and they want nearly as much for the ""free"" replacement as the scanner cost. My experience matches others I know who bought this scanner: mean time between failures of the bulb is 30 days. Buy something decent, from a company other than Microtek."
1,Do not buy this!,"I bought this scanner about a year ago and have been using with the family IMAC. The scans come out poorly. The software that came with the scanner conflicts with my zip drive. It is so ""unfriendly"" that no one in the family uses it.Save your money, buy a rock for a paperweight and treat yourself to dinner."
1,if you connect to hub BURN!!!!!,"i got one, connect to hub and burn, cos i dont know what happend, i bought another, fist connect directly and work well, when connect to hub, BURN!!!!i send email to microtek, they told some recomendations but they say that they are not responsible.... but they dont tellme that a can not connect to hub...the scanner is good, but the service dont.i think i will try another company,"
2,Disappointing Microtek,I am a Microtek fan so this product was disappointing. It is slower than my older Microtek scanner. It does well on color photographs but poor on scanning text. It especially fails when using Omnipro 10 which it claims to support. I sent it back!
1,lamp problem,After having the scanner for a little over a year the lamp burned out. I called Microtek and the only way to replace the bulb is to send the scanner to them and pay up to 200.00 to replace the lamp! To make things worse I had to hold for 20 minutes long distance. They don't even have an 800 customer service number. I'm going to buy a new scanner today and will not buy from Microtek again. I would recommend the same to everyone.
2,"A strong start, but a very weak finish....","When we first got this scanner it was great- pictures and text scanned well & the software was easy to use. BUT, about 6 months into relatively light use, the scanner started making grinding noises & stopped working altogether.We sent it for repairs- it came back broken even worse (damaged in shipping). Sent it back again for more repairs. Just got it back & it is not responding to anything. Overall, the quality is poor. We're now in the process of sending it back for good. I hope ours was just a lemon!"
3,Coffee & Bites,"You may want to think twice before buying this cookbook. The ingredients and measures are not standard to the U.S. Although equivalents are given, you will need to weigh ingredients and use nonstandard measurements, such as 7/8 of a cup of flour, or 1 ounce wheat bran. The same problem occurs with the ingredients such as biscuit crumbs, strong white flour, clear honey, muscavado sugar, or double cream. The good part is that the design is nice, the pictures are great, and the ""Perfect Brownies"" are to die for."
5,"Fabulous recipes, spectacular photography!","This book was not only a fantastic read, full of informative details for coffee lovers, and spectacularly easy and delicious recipes, it was stylistically marvelous. The photos were, in themselves, works of art. I love collecting recipe books and truly enjoy those which are not only useful in the kitchen, but also lovely to look at. I have purchased this book and am purchasing more to give as gifts. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't absolutely adore this book. There is no better coffee table book than one about coffee!"
3,Not as Helpful as I'd Hoped,"When I was new to Waldorf, wet watercolor painting was one of the first practices I added to our family life. I bought this book as it is recommended by just about everyone in Waldorf. I was surprised by how incredibly short it is! The how-to section is NOT more detailed that what you can access for free online on various waldorf sites. I was able to correct some problems with my technique by trial and error and by asking questions on various yahoo groups, instead.In my opinion this book's main contributions are showing color paintings created by children at various ages and including a very short collection of some nice seasonal poems that can inspire one's painting. Really, not as helpful as I had hoped!"
5,and I thought I knew it all when it came to painting...,"As a Waldorfish homeschool mama to 6, I saw no reason to buy this book. We paint with watercolors all the time! Really, what more could I learn about painting? This book always came across my search for other Waldorf curriculum, but I didn't pay it any mind. Well, I was wrong. Last year, I saw it at a friend's house and looked through it. I was surprised at what I ""wasn't"" doing during out painting time! The introduction to colors and the stories was very neat to read about. I went back to the basics with my 3 youngest and changed the older kids projects. I did end up buying the book to have a copy at home. I prefer having a book as to trying to bookmark websites or printing endless pages that I will misplace or have the little ones color all over."
3,Pretty but not practical,This book has lots of photos of kids paintings and philosophy on why kids should paint. I wanted directions. Here is how you do the wet on wet method. Here is how you tape the paper to the board. NOTHING.
5,Inspirational & informative,So I didn't know how to begin... This book introduced me to all my children could be and gave me ideas to inspire more.
3,"Nice Appearance, but maybe not as durable as hoped","I've like Calphalon products in the past, but some of the non-stick rubbed off almost immediately with very little use or exposure to abrasive materials. That was disappointing."
4,A Heckuva Guilty Pleasure,"""Gotta monkey hustle goin', gotta hustle!"" This is a day of celebration as MONKEY HUSTLE, one of my favorite long-out-of-print blaxploitation films has finally been rereleased! Rudy Ray Moore turns in another flamboyant, hilariously over the top performance and Yaphet Kotto's never again looked like he's having so much fun. This is by no means a great or well-made film, but you can't say it's not entertaining. You go out and buy yourself a copy, and I'm gonna keep on keepin' on...can ya dig it?"
3,OLDSCHOOL 76,"THE MOVIE WAS VERY FAR OFF, BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT HOLLYWOOD MADE IT. I SAW THE MOVIE WHEN IT RELEASED IN 1976. I RECENTLY SAW THE MOVIE, AND IT'S STILL FUNNY, AND BRINGS BACK GREAT MEMORIES.I'M FROM CHICAGO, AND I RECONIZE ALL THE AREA'S THEY FILMED IN. KEEP IN MIND THAT ALOT OF ACTORS AND ACTRESS, WENT ON TO HAVE EXCELLENT MOVIE CAREERS. CAN YOU DIG IT!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent!!,Received Precious Moments Birthday Train Age 6 in perfect condition and in very timely manner. Thanks.
3,An OK Book,"Some interesting material here, much of it similar to the underground comics genre. There are some fun stories here (like the whole Symbionese Liberation Army episode with Patty Hearst) but other stuff I really couldn't get into. Not a serious work despite the inclusion of a bibliography."
3,Return to the Past?,"Although this is a very worthy effort by Latimer and Co., as a long-time Camel follower I definitely do not see how this harkens back to ""Mirage"" era Camel as some listeners suggest. I do hear some similarities to Moonmadness and some of the latter 70's efforts in this album, however, one shouldn't be fooled into thinking this is the second coming of Mirage. Latimer's guitar work is certainly outstanding, but overall the music doesn't groove or rock anywhere near the calibre of ""Lady Fantasy"" or other early Camel classics (i.e. 1972-76 - the period that attracted me to Camel in the first place). The original Camel supporting cast of Ward, Bardens, and Ferguson is still dearly missed IMHO. All in all, a very good addition to my Camel collection, but not on par with such classics as Mirage, The Snow Goose, and Moonmadness."
5,Progressive Rock is still Alive with Camel,"Latimer and Bass proved progressive rock is still alive. Rajaz is the one best Camel and Rock artworks. While I was listening the songs like Rajaz,Three Wishes or Sahara in their concert at Traubador in West Hollywood I mesmerised by those mysterious melodies, I beleive Camel is the best.I would highly recommand for all progressive rock lovers to buy Rajaz and the other albums of Camel."
4,Guitarzan,"It's easy, if you like guitar you need to get this album. Latimer is an absolute wonder and joy to listen to. If you don't like guitar you wouldn't be reading this. This is one of Camel's finest."
5,Camel's best album,"Very unlikely to 70's bands, Camel is becoming better and better with time. They are different from the old Camel but the difference is not like becomming simple ""pop"" music but becomming softer, deeper, and perfect. The sound is very clean, the music is great. Latimer really feels what he sings and plays."
3,Camel is still in fine form!,"""Rajaz"" is the latest studio release from the long standing prog-rockers Camel. Although not a household name in America, Camel has influenced a whole generation of younger prog bands, including Pendragon, Marillion, Landmarq, and Jadis. ""Rajaz"" is a fine album, very distictively ""Camel"", with Andy Latimer's guitar in the dominant role once again. The middle-eastern flavored ""The Final Encore"" is a real treat, as are the extended instrumentals ""Three Wishes"" and ""Lawrence"". I was slightly less-impressed with this album than it's imediate predecessor, the more personal and emotionally-charged work ""Harbor of Tears"", but Camel proves that they are still one of the most creative forces in rock music. I hope that there are many more albums to come!"
5,Outstanding,"What a great album this is. Not anything resembling a weak track on it.This band has certainly gone through some changes over the years but one thing remains the same, they have one of the greatest guitar players that has ever lived leading the way, Andy Latimer.I can not give this one anything but 5 big stars."
2,Ornamenting ordinary,"Camel used to be decent for a second-tier progressive band when they emerged back in the 70's, but even that label has been fleeting in recent decades. This '99 disc is symptomatic of many weaker current prog rock outings, perhaps even more obvious then a lot of other bands who disguise the blandness and generic tooling more effectively, filled with a vast majority of mediocrity and topped with a few powerfully engaging moments that transcend the cliches."
5,Upside Band: A great New Rock Band,"This is one of the greatest new bands that I have heard in a long time. They have true talent. Energyzing songs with good lyrics. Check them out, you will be glad you did."
3,Disappoineted,"I'm a big fan of The Godfather so I was very exited when they decided to digially remaster this. After seeing the Part 1 and 2 remastered I'm am disappointed. Yes, it does look a little better on my projector screen but not as good as I thought it would. Some parts look the same as the old version and other seens are still fuzzy. I know we're dealing with a 1970's film but still think it could look better. On a few seens there is a big piece of dust that they never got rid off. I can't believe the editors missed the dust!!"
5,I'll Make you a Deal you Can't refuse.,The best movie collection to date. Anyone who does not like this movie or can't respect it needs to never buy another DvD because it doesn't get better than this. These movies were truly made with taste and style that can't or won't ever be seen again. This is a great movie if you are looking to expand your collection or if you are uncertain what to get that husband or father in your life that says he doesn't want anything for his birthday AGAIN. To some folks it might seem like a slow movie but if you just sit back and pay attention rather than wishing something would just blow up every 10 seconds you would truly understand these movies and know why it is as great as everyone says.
4,"All Godfather, all night long","This set is a dream come true for Godfather fans. It has all the films, extra footage, and interviews. I would have given the set a 5 star rating but for some reason, there's lots of extra footage that you see in the ""Godfather Saga"" that was made for TV that is not included in the set. (Yes, I know, even though the write-up says the extra footage is included, any hardcore fan that knows every scene of the saga will easily identify that much of the extra footage for the ""Godfather Saga"" made for TV, is not there.) Why? Some of that footage is excellent and really fills in lots of scenes that were too brief. If I could buy the ""Godfather Saga"" on DVD (or on VHS for that matter) I would but for now, this is the best they got."
4,"Great Movies, Except for Part III","The Godfather I and II are perhaps two of the greatest movies ever made, a fact which is clear from watching them. Godfather III, however, is a movie that, while not quite being horrible, is far from good. Pacino's performance is excellent in I and is perhaps the best part of II but, in III, there is very little interesting plot for him to work with so his performance falters. The best performance of the trilogy, however, comes from Marlon Brando, who makes Vito Correleone one of the greatest characters in movie history. On the whole, these three movies are exellent.Overall, the sound and video quality is excellent, although there were a few scenes where you could see the wear and tear on the video and where the sound degraded. Other than that the DVD series was excellent and I would highly reccomend purchasing it."
3,Godfather Trilogy,"I am a true fan of the Godfather series. I watch it on TV everytime it is on. The thing about TV is you never know what is goin to be edited out to meet the alloted time. My disappointment in this product is it too has been edited. I will continue looking for an unedited version, but in the mean time I can enjoy this selection and not have to contend with those darn commercials."
1,godfather dvd collection,"Talk about a let down,where are all the extra scenes? I guess that will be for the next release,so they can take more $$ out of my pocket.was i just me or were there some scenes missing.when tom finds sonny up stairs banging that girl against the door,when tom tells sony his pops wants him,in the video she yells out oh sonnny it wasn't on my dvd.also the scene in michael's hotel room with kay,michael makes kay call the house as a long distance operator,anybody remember that scene when it's not on my dvd i'm sure there are more but i stopped whatching i was so disappointed."
2,"Entertaining, But Seriously Overrated","Daring for its time in many ways, but hard (for me at least) to understand the real staying power or positive cultural contribution. Lots of good bloodshed, though."
2,The Boringfather is moar liek it. LOLOL!,"I know this series is in high regard for being the greatest gangster film of all-time, so I decided to check it out myself. Originally it was WAY too long for me to even want to see, but I was curious so one afternoon I sat through all of these films. That's 8 hours I'll never get back! I could've been doing something productive like playing World Of Warcraft instead. The films dragged on WAY too long and overstayed their welcome by about an hour each. There wasn't enough violence to make this a worthwhile gangster flick. Also, it was annoying when they spoke in Italian. They should've dubbed the voices instead. No one wants to read subtitles! How inconvenient. Finally, I'm giving this 2 stars because the third one was the only watchable one. Sequels made 20 years later are the bomb!See the new Johnny Depp movie ""Public Enemies"" or ""Get Carter"", ""Be Cool"" or ""Dick Tracy"" for real gangster films!"
2,More Mafia glorification from the $ crew,"Hollywood and the American movie-going public are inexplicably addicted to mafia-glorifying garbage. The Godfather is the bombastic epitome of this twisted world view, wherein criminals are heroes. I give it two stars in homage to the standout acting, strong plot lines, and solid production values; that said, ask yourself why one should support any film that glamorizes organized crime. If you'd prefer to see a film that showcases the human toll exacted by the Mafia, go see ""Excellent Cadavers"" instead."
1,I did not order this item,"I did not order this item, nor did I receive it as a gift. I checked my account and found no record of it there. I have no idea how or why I should review it."
1,Godfather Busted,This movie set was a great disappointment and no one around my home wanted to view the series. The old movies are just too slow after all the action today's films have to offer.
2,widescreen,"I love the godfather move and i did wait to get this item so long and now that i have it, I wish i did not. They only made it widescreen. They did not even think of people that do not like widescreen. I have over 7 friends that were going to buy it, but they have changed there minds."
4,Good buy of one of all time great movies,"I had the DVD versions, but wanted it for my Blu-ray collection. Good remastering and worthy add to one's collection."
1,Picture quality is plain cr@p,"I do not want to spend time on analyzing the movie, its a great piece and we know that for decades. These are the reviews of the blu ray version, so I limit my review to that.This blu ray release is plain cr@p, the worst thing I have seen in HD, in fact this is not even HD. Looks like as if the lens was smeared with vaseline, dull colors, out of focus - horrible blu ray transfer. Waste of money, if you want the film just buy on DVD it might be even better quality at a fraction of the price."
2,godfather trilogy DVD,"I eagerly awaited this title to be released on DVD, however when I received it how disappointed was I!!!I have watched the Godfather many times on VHS format & had the luck to view it as it should be seen - starting from scicily right through to the end (with all the cut scenes included in the final film)I sat down to watch & looked forward to a great evenings entertainment - I was disappointed!!A great opportunity has been lost to release this film on DVD the way it was meant to be shown - I watch it more on VHS now, more than before!!Maybe there will be a directors cut in the future!!I live in hope"
5,American film at its best,Godfather parts 1 and 2 are probably the greatest films ever made. I can't wait to get this on DVD collection.
2,Bluray Transfer not Good,"Ok, I've been watching Godfather I and II for years - one of my favorite movie themes of all time. I saw the can't beat bargain price of $25 for the Coppola Restoration Bluray Set - great deal. Unfortunately, the quality of the bluray transfer is not good. I thought I was watching a VHS version on my big screen LCD TV. This is just poor...I thought maybe the indoor scenes were grainy because of the low light but the outdoor scenes (Wedding and dancing) are just as bad. Not sure what happened here but this is not Bluray quality at all. Disappointing and a bad product. Wait for a new digitally remastered release I guess."
2,THE GODFACTHER DVD COLLECTION,"LAS PELICULAS SON MUY BUENAS, PERO ESTA VERSION NO TRAE EL IDIOMA ESPAÑOL POR NINGUN LADO. ES UNA FALLA. POR LO MENOS DEBERIA TENER SUBTITULOS. LA COMPRAMOS DE COLECCION. PERO NO NOS GUSTO POR ESE DETALLE"
1,Godfather Trilogy,"When I bought it, it did not say it was region 2. It was not useable in my DVD player. Waste of money. Not happy."
5,Awesome,I have been searching for this movie and i finally got it. Thanks for making this moment aweesome. Putting all three movies to work jajaja
1,The Godfather,The DVD's freeze while watching them on all three of the movies. Not a good quality at all. Would like to return them and order another set.
4,The Godfather,The purchase was for my husband for Valentine's Day. It was a hit!! The 4 DVD's came in a nice case and the 4th DVD is a review of deleted scenes and interviews. Nice gift for a nice price.
3,Hard to tune,"I agree with Unlucky Frank. I bought the new transfer because I thought it would be easier to tune than the original. It is not easier to tune. The yellows are very difficult to control. Some scenes need black enhancement, other scenes are too dark. The few scenes that don't need special video settings are no better than the original DVD.Both DVDs are difficult. I see no reason to put money into buying the new one."
5,Great product,This item was bought as a Christmas present for my son and his wife. They had never seen the Godfather. They said that this blu-ray set was fantastic.
5,More like a question,"Where can I get a copy of ""The Godfather Saga"". I rented it many years and remembered there were scenes that were not in the cinema releases. Also, during the first week of Oct. 1999 they had the epic/saga on TV and there were even MORE scenes that I haven't seen before. If anyone can help me locate these tapes or if anyone knows where a COMPLETE set can be found please let me know. Thank you."
4,Impressing !,"GODFATHER 1When my dad first introduced me to this movie,I really thought it is about a godfather.But when my dad told me what it was about(a mafia group) I immediately said : ""No Daddy,I don't want to see this movie.When the movie started,it was in a way quite boring for a 9 year old kid.But when I manage to flow with the movie,I got engrossed with it.It is about the Corleone family.They are mafia.This Don Corleone has three children and a daughter.Tom Hegon is Don Coleone's adopted son.Sonny,Micheal and Fredo are his real sons.Some parts are really brutal.So I encourage young kids to cover their eyes when it comes to a brutal part.I admire Tom for his loyalty,Sonny for his violence and Micheal for his amazing brain.The Corleone family,Tattaglia family and many other groups are fighting for supremacy.A lot of brutal actions take place.All the families fight each other.I was really anxious for the Corleone family.Watch this movie and you won't regret buying it."
5,The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray],Great . . . . This is an Excelent Product . . . 100% Recommended . . . . .
5,Favorite movie!,This by far is my most favorite films ever made. I could watch these movies again and again without getting sick of them!
4,It's part of my husband's heritage.,I remember standing in line to see the movie back when it first came out. It was a gear gift for my husband.
1,This is not restored video -Laser disk actually better,"Complete rip-off. Sound quality is enhanced while video is grainy much of the time especially in dark places. And lots of video noise especially when you look at the sky. I wanted to replace my Laser disk set....not worth the expense. I went back to look at my Laser Disks and the viewing experience was much more pleasant on the Laser Disk. At times the Blu-ray will be clearer but not often...and they did something with skin tones making them look less natural sometimes blotchy. I am shocked by this restoration....and will not be so eager to replace perfectly fine Laser Disks or older DVDs transferred to Blu-ray.If directors cannot improve the picture and sound quality they should not release on Blu-ray. They only reason is greed,"
5,Great DVD set!,"My only issue is with the booklet that comes with it won't fit within the box set itself. The picture is great, and I love how nice it looks on my HDTV! Totally a great set for any Godfather fan!"
2,Uggh,"I love Bluray and I love the Godfather so this appeared to be a perfect marriage. But, right from the start I was wondering if I had received the wrong discs or something. In some cases the picture quality seems to be not even as good as some previous DVD versions played via a BluRay player, in other cases the picture quality is downright terrible. What exactly did they spend that year they claim the restoration took doing? I understand that older movies won't ever look as good as other BluRay transfers but this is basically a rip-off. I have several other versions of these movies and wouldn't have bought this one if i had had any sense that the picture quality would not be any better....who would? I have the best possible set up from a player/television/connections standpoint so it isn't the equipment. Save your money and use one of the prior releases."
3,Uneven inconsistent quality transfer,"I was very dissapointed in this transfer--Specifically in the early G-1 wedding sequences, the whites are wayyyywashed out and in fact there are some scenes where it appears as if they are adjusting the F-Stops during the transfer and the effect is distracting; There is additionally a short sequence when Michael goes to the hospital to check on his father...a short clip that appears to have been skipped from the restoration--damaged and grainy-out of whack with teh rest of the repair; THe seond half of G-1 looks OK and G-2 looks OK as well---but a very uneven opening for G-1 and I aggree that it prob was not worth the money to go to this Blu-Ray version."
2,3rd is turd,first two are flawless and should be available without the atrocious monstrocity that is the third. coppola has admitted he made it just for the money and it shows. it seems his decision to release all three films only in a box set is also for the money - otherwise people would just buy the first two and not the third.
1,GREAT MOVIE...TERRIBLE PRICE,"This product is simply amazing!! the only problem is it is severely overpriced, we""re talking 250% mark-up overpriced.I use to own this exact Godfather collection a few years ago until my sister lost all the movies. I then bought the Blu Ray Coppola collection from best buy. I spent about $35 the first time i bought this collection and the blu ray is valued at $57, without tax, brand new.I hate to see people getting ripped off, my advice is to shop around instead of buying the first item you see, save that extra couple bucks and buy some more classics!"
5,Perfect Xmas gift,Timely delivery. Outstanding product. Happy recipient. Satisfied customer. I would highly recommend this vendor to anyone looking for a video product.
5,What more can you ask for?...,"This collection is great. The video is unbelievably clear and sharp for such an old film source. The audio on these films is recreated wonderfully in surround sound with painstaking detail. I have always been a fan of The Godfather trilogy and this collection will not dissapoint. I never did watch or buy this trilogy on DVD so I cannot compare this Bluray version to the DVD version (I only owned and watched this on VHS, I know that is kind of old school).I can't get enough of Bluray and my collection is growing quite nicely. This restoration is a great addition to my collection and would be a great addition to anyone's collection."
3,glitchy DVDs,"I love I and II, and I like III. That said:On this DVD set, on all four movie DVDs, pressing the ""Top Menu"" button on my DVD remote makes the movie start to play. Weird.The sound quality on the second twenty minutes of II is utterly horrible; it sounds like the dialogue is being filtered through a pillow.II being on two separate disks is a minor annoyance, but it is an annoyance that seems to be used just to market this as 5 DVDs instead of 4.The ""clever"" main menu visuals include a background that freeze frames every twenty seconds or so.The dialogue in the opening scene of I seems a couple milliseconds off between the audio and video - just enough to be noticeable.I am very glad I have this DVD set, but be prepared to be annoyed. The amateurs who did the transfer for this set should find a new line of work."
5,Downplay on Violence,"This is the best movie ever made. I can't wait for the DVD of all three of them. This movie is almost completely aloof from criticism. When people do speak badly of it, the say it glorifies violence and organized crime. This is not true. It really shows the bad side of organized crime. In the end, Michael Corleone faces many losses because of organized crime. His wife leaves him, his daughter is killed, he orders the killing of his brother and brother in law, his nephews are left fatherless because of him. In the end, he dies all alone by himself. He has lost everyone and everything he ever really cared about. So instead of a saga glorifying violence and the mafia, it is really a tragedy showing the ill effects of the mafia."
3,DVD's arrived a little smashed...,The DVD's arrived in packaging that was insufficent. The case holding the DVD set and the DVD's were smashed. Boxed set will not stand on its own. We were giving these as a gift and had to go out and purchase another set. We ended up keeping this one for us...
2,What a Mess!,"A truly great trilogy of movies (particularly the first two), reproduced in a manner that makes them almost unwatchable. Many times the actors are completely indistinguishable. This was a rotten thing to do to these movies."
5,The great American saga,Two of the greatest American films ever made and a third that is pretty good but suffers from the comparison to its predecessors. The extras are plentiful and add to the appreciation of these fine films. Definitely worth the purchase price and consideration for any film collection.
2,Disappointed...,"is the only word I can use for this DVD collection, having waited anxiously for them after placing my order day's after they were announced. As an owner of the previously released trilogy on VHS, the video quality of these DVD's is astonishingly poor in comparision. There is a tremendous amount of grain visible, it's overly dark with poor shadow detail and there's been no attempt to clean up the dirt, specks and scratches. Owner's of the VHS tapes will notice that these DVD's have not received a THX blessing and it's readily evident. I wonder what the expanation is for this, considering that, in relative comparison, the VHS tapes look far superior."
5,excellent!,"The dvd collection of the Godfather was worth every penny. Parts 1 and 2 are excellent. 3 was ok, but it brought closure to the whole Godfather saga. I also enjoyed the bonus material. It added more depth to the movies. I would recommend this collection to everyone."
4,Great Buy!!!,Bought as a Christmas gift for parents and they loved it. It was a great price for me and something I knew the parents would love!!!
5,The Godfather trilogy,"The Godfather Trilogy is the perfect gift for any fan of mafia gendre. The films ( 1 & 2)are just perfect, storyline, cast & cinematography. I am always amazed that each time I have viewed these films, I always glean something new. As 'Michael', Al Pacino is a marvel. From the first time we meet Michael to the final scene, Al evolves from a 'nice' guy to 'evil.' Yet, I am compelled to watch these films. Just the BEST. Film 3, to me, was miscast, and just not as fine a film as the other 2."
4,"As a Whole, Almost Perfect","The novel, ""The Godfather"" was the first adult book I ever read. I have since read it twice more. It is rare that one can say that a movie is better than the book, but in this case it is true. Parts I and II are two of the finest movies ever made. Part III will always be up for debate. Personally, I did not care for it.I found the box set, handsome and wonderfully presented. The added features were entertaining as well as informative.If you are a movie fan, you have seen the three movies already. If you are not a movie fan you have to see this entire set.Get it for someone during the holiday season this year.Enjoy."
3,The Godfather...Restored & CLIPPED!!!,"Yes, this 'The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration' set is visually stunning and the 5.1 surround sound is great, BUT they clipped small portions out of the original movie(s). Especially on the 'Godfather II', where various scenes have been deleted & edited so that the movie could be compressed onto a single DVD. I knew it was too good to be true when reading the package details and regret selling my previous 'Godfather' box set. As for the new bonus material, I enjoyed most of it (some of it is useless FLUFF!), but all of the extras could've been placed on a single disc. If you have the previous 'Godfather' box set, KEEP IT and ignore this 'restoration', which is nothing but a hack job!!!"
5,Greatest Movie of All Time,"This is a Mafia obessed geeks dream. I love reading, watching, playing anything related to the Mafia. And these movies, by far, are the greatest Mafia flicks of all time. The first one is my personal favorite of the three. It shows Michael Corleone's rise to the Don of the Corleone crime family. The second one is also great, showing Michael as the Don of the Mafia in Neveda and the eventual destruction of his family. The third one isnt as great but its still a darn good flick. It shows the complete destruction of Michaels life and everything he holds dear. So if your a fan of Mafia flicks go out and buy these."
5,The best version of one of the best film sagas ever.,"First off, I too have seen this set offered for far less. However, at any price, it's worth it. Even if you have the 2001 set, this new version has a much crisper picture and sound, making it a much better experience to watch and fully enjoy. The new extras are wonderful such as the great documentary on the problems making the film and how the film has impacted popular culture. The leftover extras from the first set are still great like the hour-long documentary on the making of the saga and the slew of deleted scenes that do add new layers (and for thos complaining about this not being the ""Saga"" set, some of those scenes are included in this category). So for any fan of either these films or just great movies in general, this set is a must-have in order to enjoy these classics to their fullest."
2,"A very LAZY ""Restoration"".....","I bought the 2001 DVD box set and was happy with it, but when the Blu Ray set was released I was excited....Until I watched it!!The Blu Ray set does NOT look much different than the DVD set (which I set up side by side to check them out in my home theater). In fact, the DVD set on an upconvert DVD player looks BETTER!!Save your money and just buy or keep your DVD set, you WILL NOT be happy with the so called Blu Ray version....it's really just the DVD set on Blue Ray discs if you ask me.....and DARK too, some scenes are hard to see also....the dark is too dark even in a pitch black room as I have."
2,"They made me an offer, and I refused!","Talk about the DVD DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR! Like many, I've been waiting for this release but I couldn't believe the shabby quality associated with it. Paramount blew it!Many would like to have seen the release of the Godfather Saga/Epic, but that didn't happen so this 5 disk set had to do.And it was horrible.Godfather 1 and 2 are excellent movies. Godfather 3 was a huge disappointment.Having said that, I still purchased this 5 disk set, hoping to view them in all the technical splendor Paramount had to offer.Apparently, they had none and released this poor quality offering for the money only, not for any artistic reasons.The video transfer is horrible but the audio was very good. But, I want to watch AND hear a good movie.I returned this 5 disk set today and will not buy any subsequent release until I've read as many reviews as possible.Francis made Godfather 3 for the money and it appears Paramount released this disappointment for the same reason."
5,Masterpiece,"Film making rarely reaches this level. While many were dissapointed in Part 3,the final install ment of triologies (think Star Wars) often pale in comparison. The middle segments are usually the strongest. If 1 & 2 didn't exist, critics would have been kinder to 3. Copolla seems to want to tie up the loose ends when in reality those ends still dangle before us and tantillize us even today (think Sopranos).The DVD set is well constructed and vast;ly superior to the 25th Aniv. VHS edition"
3,WHY,"I have loved the GODFATHER SAGA from the beginning. When the DVD version came out, I even purchased a DVD in order to watch it. The cinematography of the DVD version is perfect. HOWEVER my biggest and only gripe is... why did they put the extra parts on a separate CD.. why didnt they incorporate them in the movie???? That made no sense. I have the VHS chronological version with out the cut scenes.. I was hoping the DVD version would have incorporated them...as much as this thing costs... would that have been a problem???WHY.. now do I have to spend another 100 bucks for the edited snippets to be incorporated??? WHY?"
3,My review of THE GODFATHER,I thoroughly enjoyed Phase one of The Godfather. Phase two was disconcerting due to intermittent flashbacks. Phase three was a little confusing in regard to sequence; example - - Frankie's involvement and his alliance. Overall I wish the story had started in Sicily; then continued with the part played by Marlon Brando.
2,Not needed on Blu Ray,As MOST BR titles this is another one that should be passed. BR doesnt highlight any (restored) improvements to this trilogy. I have been a bit more picky as of late on which titles I have been picking up on blu ray due to lame transfers. This is an improvement to the earlier dvd set however BR doesnt give it any advantage. For the price 6 of one half dozen of the the other.
1,The Godfather Part III and Sofia Coppola,"The best thing about The Godfather Trilogy? The Godfather Part IIThe worst thing about the Godfather Trilogy? Sofia CoppolaThe best thing that happened in The Godfather Trilogy? Sofia Coppola dies in the end! Thank God!The worst and most disgusting actor or actress in The Godfather Trilogy? Sofia CoppolaMy God, Sofia Coppola, what a terrible and disgusting actress. ZERO acting ability and gross looking. BLAH!!!Not many people know this but, Sofia Coppola was cast in The Godfather Part I as a little boy. It is ironic because I thought she looked like a person who had a sex change in The Godfather Part III. Man what an ugly duckling. :-)What a shame The Godfather Part III had such a poor looking non-talented beast of an actress shoved into it. Again, what... a... shame..."
2,Godfather Cut?,"I was very disappointed In this release! Why he decided that it would be a better movie if he cut scenes is beyond me. For example, he cut out the scene of Michael and Kay at the hotel, not answering the phone. Instead they show Michael and Kay returning from a movie and Kay seeing a newspaper with the news of the shooting of the Godfather. No explanation why they didn't know until long after everyone else knew.While Michael is in Corleone he marries a beautiful local girl who is killed by one of Michael's bodyguards. The scene showing the revenge killing of the bodyguard in America, is cut.In Godfather 2 the scenes of Vito's revenge on the guards that searched for him when he was a young boy, threatening anyone that would help him, cut. You get the idea, many scenes known to the fans of these movies were cut by the director! I am confident that many fans were disappointed by this version of the films and the numerous missing scenes."
2,godfather,I was very dissappointed with the appearence of the outer case (as it was to be a gift) It was pretty scuffed up and still had sticker price tags on it that if were removed waould have ripped the package further. Needless to say so close to christmas and all had to ask my dad to switch out his. The disc were fine the package not so good.
1,Smell and Beret,"Long before the Sopranos, came the soap opera epic of the Spaghettis. They yell at the dinner table, they have affairs with each other's wives, and they murder everybody in sight ... especially each other! Yay!This spicy meatball was cooked up by an unholy alliance: Puzo & Coppola -- which translates (loosely) as Smell & Beret.There goes the neighborhood."
2,No Godfather Saga--- No Complete Chronological version,"Dear Mr Coppola You Restoration idea is crap. It is an apology for a terrible DVD release. AND WHERE IS THE THE COMPLETE EPIC?????? The chronological one??? With ALL THE OUTTAKES!!!. This Version in many of our minds is the finest film. Do hand any damn excuses. Consumers: DON""T BUY this totally incomplete box set. I have the VHS set of THE COMPLETE EPIC it's only weaknesses are VHS resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio. I am Making a BLURAY copy. Everyone with this version should do the same to preserve it before Coppola deep sixes his best version like he did with Abel Gance's Napoleon with his father's score. I believe in paying for a product BUT HOW MANY TIMES AM I GOING TO GET RAPED PAYING FOR INCOMPLETE AND INFERIOR PRODUCT? WAKE UP FRANCIS. Whattza matta you?"
2,not so hot,"Though I am not the slightest bit Italian, I thought these movies were a little ethnically offensive. Not to mention the fact that nothing interesting ever really happened. I have seen these movies many times and honestly cannot quote a single line from any of them. My son Herb loves this series but I think he is just being plain silly, SILLY! I say put your money towards something a little more worthwile - like the new blockbuster smash ""Snowdogs"" - I have already seen that one 5 times!"
5,The Godfather collection,I was very happy to see that the Godfather was released in Blu-ray. A perfect gift for someone...of the best movie ever. Great collection and I received it in a very timely manner.
5,Whats To Not Like?,I know I have been eying this collection since the last time it was in the Gold Box and have kicked myself since for not buying it. Well my chance came back week before last and it was in the Gold Box again and I didn't wait this time. Yes there is some graininess but in all honesty I feel that just adds to the movie and the entire feeling as a whole. Myself personally I feel this collection is great; there are some touch-ups done but for the most part it is intact and enjoyable for me. I love these kind of mobster flicks and they make up a good bit of my collection and I will say when it comes to mobster type movies this one is at the top of the list. If you want something that is the latest and greatest just wait for a decent mobster flick to come out but you will be missing out on this classic that is for sure.
5,the godfather saga,This movie was unforgettable. The saga version is the most memorable for me because it combined the entire story the way the director would have done if he could have predicted its success. Too bad it is no longer available for future generations to enjoy...
5,as good as it gets,"Simply amazing.What I love about the series is its completeness, the richness in portrayal by each of the actors, even if they had small parts. Above all everything in ""one-box"" of 4 DVDs.A must buy. The specials DVD is the clincher with unbelievable revelations, material that you never imagined about this epic series - imagine someone telling you that Martin Sheen and James Caan auditioned to play Michael. This is educational."
4,amazing!!,"wow, what an incredible package!!! You get all three movies theatrically (sorry, no re-edited ""Godfather Saga"") plus an entire DVD of bonus materials. The extra footage that appeared in the re-editiong of ""Godfather Saga"" appears there. That's why it 4 stars is that you only get the theatrical cut of the films. overall, a great package that is not to be missed. Howevr, there cOULD be a future box set DVD, though at the time, it coul dbe unlikely."
4,"Great Movies,Poor extras","The DVD quality of the trilogy is excellent to say the least and granted parts 1 and 2 are definitely in anyones top ten all time best,and contrary to most critics part 3 is in my opinion a very well crafted movie and deserving of a place in the top ten best of the 90,s. My arguement is that the deleted scenes should have been inserted into the movies proper as unlike other movies these scenes are important to the story and should not be left as an extra. I dont agree with those so called purists that the chronological edition is inferior,as a matter of fact I think it is superior and hopefully in the future Coppola can find the time and sources to release this option on DVD. I would welcome it rather than the horrible rumour of a Godfather part 4.......Thats an offer I would refuse!"
3,"Great film(s), but..............","This is one of my favorite film series of all time. I & II were great films, as everyone else has stated. My only complaint, and this is a BIG one- Why weren't the DVD's digitally remastered? The quality is horrible on these DVD's. You can see the film scratches on the DVD. It looks like I'm actually watching the original VHS tape from 1972. Hopefully, another version is the works, to give these films the quality they deserve."
4,A classic - but get the Restoration,"The Godfather saga (at least parts I and II) are classics. I won't go on too much about the movies themselves in this review. However, I should mention that Coppola has come out withThe Godfather: The Coppola Restoration, which cleans up the movies and has more bonus features. I'd recommend getting that one instead of this collection."
5,The Essential DVD,"This DVD is what DVD players were made for - crisp visuals, masterful sound and lots of goodies like left-out scenes and Francis Ford Coppola's narrative of GF1 and GF2."
2,5 for the movie one for box set thje worst one i own,"first of all the movies expect three are great movies and anybody who watches movies know this. The problem is the box set where do i start the transfer of one is almost unwatchable specks and grain thourgout, lighting is also very bad. The second and escpecially the third are deccent but nothing to write home about, the packing is awful and each time the discs are watched and returned to the cases they get scratched. why make a box set like this the rocky and superman boxes were packaged better then this although they had very few features expect on the first movies.The only thing good abot the set is the fifth disc of bonus materails they are nice and enjoyable, bottom line don't buy this they will issue a new and better version very soon am sure just like thier doing for almost famous in decemember."
3,I got burned,"I didn't read the customer review above about non-compatibility with some DVD players, and therefore cannot play the material I was most interested in seeing: the bonus disk. Truly a freaking gyp, and one for which I am very disappointed/mad with Partamount. Don't quite understand what the technical problem is, but the thought that they wouldn't be compatible with common brands (I also have a Pioneer player) is ludicrous. Backfire on you, studio boys--I'm never buying another one of your boxed sets again."
2,Fagetaboutit,"Godfather 3 erases all the good that 1&2 give. I have good equipment, but the audio is impossible to understand. It sounds like you are in the subway all the time, even when they clearly are no where near it. It seems like they lay down a track of loud hissing over the whole production. This is the restored version? It's a slap in the face for loyal fans."
3,Godfather DVD released October 2001,"I am disapointed:1. Many scenes have been deleted from the original Goddfather movies.2. Why was this not available in a wide screen format.3. I know John Cazale passed away some years ago and was not available for interviews. But surely there were some out-takes of conversations with John that could have been included.4. I was looking forward to this collection. I am sorry I purchased it and if I could get a refund, I would quickly return the collection."
3,IT'S A MUST HAVE BUT..................,to own gf 1 and 2(forget about 3)with a bonus disc is a sweet dream gone sour.my (...) excalibur dvd looks and sounds better than this collection.pt 1 will test the black levels of your t.v. to the limit.at first i thought someone tampered with my video settings.in fact a few scenes in gf 1 seemed to be out of sync.i'm ready to send this set back to paramount!!!anyone interested in joining me?
3,The chronologic saga of the Corleone family.,"I thought I was purchasing the chronological saga of the Godfather. However, the first 2 movies were not chronologically edited. I'm disappointed but also a fan so I will enjoy what I purchased and keep looking for the re-edited version where the time line starts at the beginning and does not jump back and forth. I enjoyed all 3 films in the theater. I'm happy but not thrilled. peace, Packy Paules"
3,Not worth the Blu-Ray,"Dont get me wrong. I love the godfather! I owned all 3 on VHS and DVD. When I went from VHS to DVD, there was a HUGE difference in picture and sound quality. I loved it! So I decided, well since I got the blu-ray, let me get the blu-ray version of one of my all time favorite trilogies! Heck it is the The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration set, so the picture has to be UNREAL. Popped it in and the title menu was pretty grainey. So that was disappointing but I figure, just the title, no big deal. So I site back, get ready to experience my godfather flick in Blu-Ray, hit play and......WOW! STILL GRAINEY!! So really I was not sure why I just got rid of the DVD version to get the Blu-ray version!? But it is still the Godfather, I love the flick and can never get enough. If you have the DVD version, dont waist your money to get the blu-ray. There is not much of a change in picture quality."
1,I agree--very disapointed,"I agree with the review from dvc...I just noticed a slight difference in the wedding scene, the audio tracks were completely off in some scenes it was like watching a dubbed movie...i called Amazon they sent me a label and I am sending it back"
5,a masterpiece,get it right away for your collection. the blueray edition only makes it that much better!!! this is truly the father of all gangster films of all time.
1,HORRIBLE DVD TRANSFER,"Prestine DVD it is not! I was greatly disappointed on the transfer and picture quality of this long anticipated DVD collection. Scratches and dirt apparent on the original film elements and high digital compression rates make the ""creeping crawlies"" on faces simply unacceptable especially when viewing on a big screen. Just as Stanley Kubrick's highly anticipated first DVD collection was simply a joke, so is this Godfather collection. Paramount DVD's in general are poorly mastered and this collection is no exception. Just as Warner ended up having to remaster Kubrick's DVD collection with better elements, Paramount should also consider doing the same with The Godfather."
1,I wonder if Coppolla knows that this will not play properly on most BluRay players?,I want my money back. Course I can't because I excitedly opened the package. Who knew that I would need a brand spanking new BluRay player to see the quality output? The bonus disk talks about how much time and trouble they went through to restore the film.Too bad my VHS copy looks better!Now I know why it was only $18 on Amazon - because only Coppolla has the brand spanking new bluray player required to view this presentation properly!BUYER BEWARE. My newest player is only two or three years old and it wouldn't play these disks to their fullest potential. (At least it was only $18 and not $53).
1,Such a classic... mishandled,"I *love* this movie, along with half the planet. However, I have a home projection theatre and the image is projected onto a screen that's about 15 foot diagonal. This is at the limit of what DVD can handle. If you have an excellent transfer -- like The_Matrix or Star Wars I or even Lawrence of Arabia -- its a movie theatre experience. If you have [this] (from the video usually rather than the original master, because its so much cheaper to do it that way) transfer, a great film is ruined (The Last Emporer comes to mind) because VHS is unbearably grainy at that size. Why am I posting this?Yes, they did such a transfer for this classic. My eyes weap to see all the lush richness of Coppola's camera lost. I cannot believe the studio could have been this [way] with a film as visually appealing as any of Coppola's works are.Don't buy it. Don't buy this until they do it right, from the master original. This film deserves better and so do we."
5,Great!,"First time ever watching The Godfather, and I was blown away. A must see and something that will add great value to any movie collection."
5,Movies,"Got it as a gift. The person receiving it is a die hard ""Godfather"" fan. If you have someone like this great gift."
3,Restoration is not necessarily better,"While I loved the original segmented TV presentation, later there was a presentation where the whole thing was put in order of occurrence of the events in the saga. The Coppola Restoration goes back to the flashback presentation. Despite this, I loved all the actors' performances, except maybe Sofia Coppola. She isn't convincing as an actress and should stay behind the camera. That's just my opinion."
5,Godfather DVD Collection,Anyone who purchases this product will be more than satisfied. We've had the Godfather trilogy on VHS tapes for years but this collection is superb. Youll see many clips that weren't in the original releases. Can't beat the price either for this collector's item!
3,Save Your Money and Get the LD-set,"My LD Box Set incorporated the entire saga in one humongous 9 hour saga with all the deleted scenes put in the right places.I am in Hong Kong so instead of schlepping the LD player and the box set, I bought a DVD player and the DVD set. What a gross rip-off. They just copied the three original disjointed parts and did not bother to put in the deleted scenes which do count for something. Eg. the rub-out of Fabrizio - that ... who allowed Appolonia to die - was never mentioned and Michael's painful recovery from that loss was never shown. Quality is no hell. My laser-disc set is far superior in quality. The extra scenes and stuff is already on the laserdisc box setSorry, but this was hype and all it is to me is another example of quick slap-dash drek.So my opinion:......feh!!!!!...!!!!!!"
4,Two of the greatest films ever - Pity about the packaging,"Okay, like everyone else here I am a HUGE Godfather fan and have been waiting for these to come out on DVD forever, so when these arrived in the mail I was thrilled. But they have completely wasted the DVD format -- menus don't come up till the end, all suplemental material is on the extra disk, and the packaging is flimsy at best (I have had this three days and already the plastic DVD protectors are peeling off from the cardboard. And why no reading materials?? Incomprehensible. And how crafty of them to sell these only as a set so we all have to buy Godfather III......"
2,The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration),"Thought I was getting deleted scenes that had been left out of the theatrer version. I was hoping for the scenes I that were in the television version, (might be referred to as the directors cut.)"
1,Product is fine but Seller is AWFUL!!,"This product is as wonderful as one would expect, but the seller - authenticrarevideos - is rude, awful, and uncooperative. I was sent the wrong thing (...ordered a collectible and got a product very obviously USED...so grossly overpaid for what I got...) and the seller refuses to cooperate on fixing the problem. I'm writing this here because I am unable to get in to make my seller feedback worse than it already was. I'm in the process of filing a claim with Amazon now. Hopefully, THEY'LL stand by their word!DO NOT DARE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THIS AMAZON SELLER!!!"
5,Perfect Collection,"Although some may say there's no need to include the third one, it IS a trilogy and deserves some respect even if it's the least liked."
5,Greatly Restored,I bought this on Blu-Ray and may I say after comparing it to the DVD version this restoration looks better. The details are just where they need to be and now you'll notice things you've never noticed before.If your a fan of the classic mafia films than this is a must buy for you.
2,how it should be,"I think the movie(s) were excellent,but am disappointed that no one wants to produce a dvd that shows the story in Chronological Order!!!I,personally,would like to sit & watch the movie begin- ning with Vito as a boy then onto his life as a ""successful""Don. Then continuing with his sons,etc. Please,can someone do this.If a dvd of this caliber is finally produced,I would be first in line to purchase it...cost ?..no object!Also please add the scenes that were"" thrown on the floor..."". thanks for letting me air my opinion. Errol M."
3,A Dissapointing Reviewing,"The passage of nearly 40 years hasn't been kind to this series of films. What was dazzling and electrifying to audiences back then, has been dulled by countless imitations--specifically the cable smash, The Sopranos.In the original Godfather, performances still impress, especially Marlon Brando. Robert DiNiro in the sequel is still powerful. But the way these movies were made, with long, long unbroken shots, a leisurely way of telling the story now come close to being boring. We have much dialogue, followed by silences and reaction shots, and many of us are impatient for something to happen. In the beginning marriage sequence that starts The Godfather, minutes tick by until thirty minutes later, we're finally into a different scene.Some Oscar winning movies that were smash hits upon release sadly to not hold up for modern audiences. The Godfather saga is one of them."
1,Crass commercialism at its height,"I love the movie (5 stars) but this HIGH PRICED DVD is crass commercialism at its height. The producers simply wanted to cash in on the marketability of the Godfather mystique. If they are true film lovers they should release the movie WITHOUT the old and recycled documentaries at a more reasonable price and release a special edition for those who want to waste their time on second-rate documentaries.DVD lovers watch out... if this turns into a hot seller, expect to see more of the modern classics packaged in the same gouging way."
5,The Godfather Trilogy is the best movie saga of all time....,"All three of these movies are the best movies of all time! All have amazing casts and amazing stories. It's very moving, exciting, and eye-opening. I can't decide which one of them is the best though.........Drew Smith 12-years old"
3,The Godfather Trilogy,i am sure this was great product. However Be careful to know what you order. This itemdid not work in our DVD players. We were disappointed to say the least. It was also not an easily returned product. It came from London. The company gave a little money back. I opted not to return. This experience taught me to read fine print. I will buy American next time.
5,The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration,"The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration was a gift to my husband for our wedding anniversary. He can be hard to shop for however I am always reminded how much he likes the Godfather movies. When I saw this on amazon.com I didn't hesitate to order it for him. He truly appreciated my gift. I suggest everyone purchase this edition, its great!"
5,Filmmaking at it's most poignant and best,"The entire collection is breathtaking. Although part 3 is not on par with the others, it is still miles beyond it's contemporaries. Being a major film aaficionado, all 3 of these films are brilliant. In my opinion, parts I and II should have been the AFI's one and two best films. They both have the unique quality of embracing almost every angle of modern drama (romance, revenge, aspirations). I must admit that after seeing Scarface, my respect for Pacino wained, but this movie fully restored it."
5,The movie of all movies,"All of the Godfather movies are great. Althought i have all the movies already i wish the studios would release the recent edition. I have followed these movies all the way and will continue to do so at all times. I think all of the actors are great in the movies, and feel that no matter what, no other producer will ever make a movie coming near to the Godfather, and probably never will."
2,Audio is not good,"This blu-ray restoration has bad audio: the music is too loud, the dialogue too soft. In order to hear the dialogue, the volume has to be increased too much. Not an enjoyable purchase."
1,Disappointed,"After waiting forever for the DVD version, I was angry about the poor visual quality of the film. Aside from the constant grainy yellow look, much of the film is in darkness making it impossible to see the faces of the actors. I'm shocked there would be such little attention to the visual transfer. The audio is fine but I didn't find any of the deleted scenes mentioned making this a forgettable collection. The Sopranos does a far better job. Rent the DVD version prior to buying if you're serious about spending this kind of money, and get a heads up about what to expect. If you're smart, you'll save your money and just get the collection on video -- the visual quality exceeds the DVD version."
5,In response to review by jem-aja,"You, my friend, are a complete idiot. The first 2 Godfather movies are masterpieces. Hmmm, day dreaming in cinema class...if you are thinking about pursuing a career in film, may I suggest another choice for your life's work?"
3,mario puzo will cry.........,i have read godfather then i saw the dvd.... frankly i did not get the same excitemement whil watching the movie as while reading the novel. the director could not do justice to the writer. the plot moves too fast .....a person who has not read the novel will find himself lost in the movie.star cast is also just ok.i was disappointed.
2,A Soap Opera for Men,"Does nobody have the ""cajones"" to say it? Sure, the few Brando scenes we get in the first installment are priceless (as if Brando needs to stuff cotton into his mouth to make his speech less understandable than it already is), and Al Pacino's horrible speech impediment is craftily covered up by a somewhat contrived ""broken jaw"", but Puzo's Godfather series is nothing more than a soap opera for men.Instead of interviews with Francis Coppola and the now-dead Puzo at the beginning of the tapes, I think they should have had commercials for Old Spice and Right Guard.All in all, the series is part of a growing American genre that glorifies the terrible acts of bullies. Hey, we love mobsters in America. Kudos to the now-dead Puzo for delivering this violence to our households in a charming fashion.In case you think this is a pan, I've seen these movies several hundred times, and I know almost every line from them."
3,Glorifies organized crime,"If there is ever a film designed to make excuses for the behaviour of bunch of criminals, this is it. Not recommended for children. This collection glorifies organized crime and should be strictly for adults."
5,well done,"just wanted to say i recieved my copy on friday, i only put it on to see what the quality was like and i have to say good job, once i put it on i didn't want to turn it off. notn only was it nice and clear but it was full screen. it's not often i can sit down and watch an old movie, its good how the picture quality makes all the difference."
4,Gotta love the Classics,I would have to say this is one of the best collections of movies I have every watched. The first and the second are amazing and the third ties the saga to an end.
2,"Forgive me lord, I have blasphemized","So, a bunch of mafia gangsters come over and shoot each other up, then they go out west and shoot each other up there, including one particular scene in which a bunch of people all get shot up together as part of a sort of montage. Woo hoo. How brilliant. I'll never forget this movie. NOT."
1,Blu-Ray Review,"One Star, enough said about the so called Blu-Ray Review. Save your money.What was I thinking."
1,Mixed messages,"I'm not sure there has ever been a good ""gangster"" movie, these films included. Why? Because gangster movies are more focused on nothing but glorifying crime and the criminal lifestyle, and that's dangerous.So while the ""Godfather"" films sit at or near the top of many a crtic's ""favorite movie"" lists, I encourage you to think about what you're watching.As for the movies themselves, they're nothing special."
5,"The first two are excellent films, the third one fails","Parts I and II are top-notch pictures full of excellent acting, tight dialogue and unforgettable scenes! Part III is terrible: don't even bother..."
1,This is not a Licensed Authenic Release,"Received this shipment from Shenzhen, China! This is not a licensed, authentic release. There isn't a proper bar code on the playside, nor a proper 6 digit serial number. It doesn't have the necessary FBI warning at the beginning of the discs. It was not appropriately sealed with the proper white security tape. It is clearly a bootleg copy and the video quality bears this out. The onscreen graphics were crude further indicating bootlegging."
3,same old chopped and cut version out there since the early 80's,"I received this blu-ray for my birthday and even though I like it I see it is still not the original 1972 release that I saw in theaters when it first came out. I am very disapointed that the film makers caved in to pressure from censors and mainly the Mafia to tone down the original content, which was more true to real life, because they didn't want to offend anyone. Sorry but it's the same old same old for me. If there is an original version out there in regular or blu-ray out there I would very much like to purchase it."
4,SAGA! SAGA! SAGA!,"COPPOLLA! OR WHO EVER WAS IN CHARGE, KNOWING THAT THERE IS SO MUCH SPACE AVAILABLE IN A DVD WHY DID'NT YOU ADD-IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL ""SAGA"" VERSION SO WE WON'T GET DIZZY FROM GOING BACK AND FOWARD ON THE SECOND DVDS'(PART 2). AS SOME OF YA'LL MAY KNOW, I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE ""BIG TALL BLACK BOX"" THAT WAS PUT OUT A FEW YEARS AGO ON VHS. ANYWAY THAT'S MY TWO CENTS, THANK YOU FOR READING.P.S. (SAGA!, SAGA!, SAGA!)"
5,I'm making a review you can't refuse.,"Possible one of the greatest trilogy of all time, this set takes the DVD experience to a differnt level. The sound and picture are excellent and the movie just looks great. As for the bonus material, I hope you have a few hours to waste, because this this is filled to the rim with bells and whistles. My only knock is the The Godfather Part II, is on two discs, but considering the movie is 3 1/2 hours long it might be understandable, but I figured they could have jammed it onto one disc by dual layering. Other than that small complaint this is a great box set and should be a must in anyone's DVD collection."
2,Save your $ -- Restored Set Due in Sept. '08,"Just a PSA -- Paramount has announced that a new restoration of all three films will arrive in September 2008, coming on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.This 2001 set is adequate, but that's about it. Save your money and pick up the restored version at the end of summer."
5,Worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray,"This set was one of the few in my dvd collection worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray. I'm speaking of The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2, of course. Part 3 is a complete snoozer and if I could have saved a nickel by buying only 1 and 2 I certainly would have done so.Since I was in no hurry, I waited for the set to be on sale, then bought it for $20, almost half of it's current price. It seems the price of dvds on Amazon is more volatile than the stock market!"
2,Poor DVD qualtity Transfer,"Very poor tranfer to DVD.Grainy, contrast too high - no shadow detail.Lots of specks and dust that should have been cleaned up.The darks are so dark that you see little or no detail, ex: Pacino's hair and dark clothing render no or very little detail, just black, you wont see any strands of hair or folds and pockets on dark suits.The cardboard cases eventually will fall apart with use in time.The old widescreen video version has better quality than the DVD.It seems that Paramount did a quickie job to get this box set out and make there bucks, and in so doing compromised the quality and attention that these great films deserve."
1,Received this in horrible condition,"The DVD jacket came damaged and torn, I am very disappointed that Amazon actually shipped this to me in the condition that they did. I don't buy many DVDs anymore due to the extremely digital world we now live in, but this is a classic and I wanted it in Bluray. Unfortunately this is probably the last time I purchase DVDs from Amazon. (Hard to believe right?)"
3,Excellent series. Not blu ray quality,"I agree with most of these reviews, positive and negative. The bottom line is that the dvd's are rather grainy but are still sharp quality. Its been a long time since I have owned a vhs player but Im sure that if I put the two side by side I would be able to tell a great diffrence in quality. However this generation is not trying to recapture 1970 for nostalgia, but blu ray quality for their big screen. All that aside I would reccomend this for its price and the quality thus far"
4,Disappointed with the Box Set Packaging,"As a long-standing fan of the Godfather movies, I received my Region 1 copy in the UK last Saturday. However, after waiting so long for the release of the DVD Collection I was very disappointed with the packaging. The bonus materials are excellant, especially the clip of ""The Sopranos"" which can be found in the DVD credits. The packaging should have reflected the contents of this masterpiece in cinema history."
5,"Keep your friends close, but your enimies closer !","What can I say, simply the best movie(s) I have ever seen ! The script writing, acting and casting are all superb. Anyone who does not purchase this set is not a film historian. Thank you paramount for finally releasing on DVD. Remember, who ever comes to you with this Bazinni offer is the traitor !"
5,capolavoro!,"Brando, Pacino, De Niro.............il massimo per una trilogia strepitosa! pochi film si possono paragonare a questi come pochi sono gli attori talentuosi come i tre protagonisti!"
5,An American epic,"Do we really need one more person saying that the Godfather series represents a towering achievement in American film? This box set is an exceptional release. ""Part II"" is my personal favorite, but ""Part I"" is not far behind. ""Part III,"" despite some ludicrous hit scenes and Sofia Coppola's atrocious acting, is not as bad as many have said (it has a terrific finale). The extra features are fantastic! Coppola's commentary is compelling, revealing many fascinating details about the making of the films, the people involved, and his own battles with the studio. It may be expensive, but the sheer rewatchability of these films and the plethora of extras promise many hours of viewing pleasure."
2,The Godfather Collection,Got this to see if it stood the test of time. Really enjoyed these when the first came out many years ago but found them to be dated and did not watch the remainder after shutting the first movie down half way through. The sound quality was also pretty poor.
4,Does this Godfather Collection compare to the LaserDisk ver?,"I am proud to say that I own the LaserDisk version of the triology - The Godfather. I'm not as happy to say that I'm a LaserDisk owner. Otherwise, The greatest achievement LaserDisk has is that the Godfather Triology is put together in sequential order. Where the flashbacks are all in chronological order in the triology. You are watching 1 movie instead of 3. It's AWESOME!Therefore, Will this ""The Godfather DVD Collection"" have this same feature?Thanks, adonato3@acorn-group.net"
1,"Don't buy it, maybe we can get a fair price","I've wanted the Godfather DVD ever since I bought my player. One and Two are among my favorite movies of all time. But Coppola made a lousy movie with Three and now he wants us to pay for it. I mean its a shame his kid can't act worth a dime (have you seen her in anything before or since?) but why pick our pockets for it. So that leaves us paying at least 75 bucks for 2 (albeit great) movies. Please, we've all waited this long, wait a little longer and they'll have no choice but to split them up and we can all buy the movies we want rather than having an aweful movie cramed into our collections."
2,Don't think it is new!,"I ordered this set as ""new"". However, it came unsealed and marred. I was giving it as a gift and was a bit embarrassed that it didn't seem ""new"" as expected. It hasn't been viewed yet, so I don't know if there is any damage to the disks. I was very disappointed."
3,Why Not the Godfather Saga on DVD-Disappointed,"I was originally excited by the prospect of a restoration figuring that there would finally be the ""Saga"" footage added. I have the ""Saga"" on prerecorded VHS and have always felt that the chronological handling of the material plus the added footage played well.The extras will be certainly be worth the new investment as well as the enhancements but it would have been great to have the ""Saga"""
3,The video quality is just OK,"I was really looking forward to this title. I haven't seen the Godfather in a while and when I heard that the Blu-Ray version had gotten a hand makeover I thought it's time to buy it.I was very disappointed in the quality of the picture, the colors were just OK and a lot of things just faded into black throughout the scenes.All in all it was a good buy but I really believe it could've been so much better. This film deservers it!"
1,This is NOT in original aspect ratio (1.85:1). It is pan & scanned to 16:9 (1.78:1),"This ""Coppola Restoration"" Blu-ray is NOT 1.85:1 as it should be, as Amazon says it is, and how it was originally released, theatrically. Instead, it was pan and scanned to 1.78:1 (16:9) to fill HDTV screens without a small but necessary letterbox. Therefore, part of every frame is cut out. It is inexcusable for this landmark piece of American film history. Amazon has the spec wrong, and the packaging conveniently does not list the aspect ratio. For all of the reviewers who don't notice or complain about this, maybe they have never viewed these discs. Unfortunately I did not notice until it was too late to return it, otherwise I would have. The video quality is also poor for the hype of it being the ""Coppola Restoration."""
1,What restoration?,"Still one of my favorite movies of all time - but I see absolutely no difference between the quality of my DVD box set from a few years ago and this offering - except this one has a couple of digital glitches. I think the only thing that was ""restored"" was Paramount's interest in repackaging this classic & making a few bucks. Again."
5,Godfather Trilogy 1901 to 1980,"This is absolutely fantastic viewing but we no longer have a VHS recorder, need it to be brought out on DVD, if it has let me know!!"
5,The Godfather DVD Collection,What else is there left to say about this masterpiece.....Magnifico!watch it time and time again there is always something you missed on the previous twenty times you watched it.
5,Great Deal,"Picked this up from Amazon when it was on sale. Great price and great movie set. If you are unsure about The Godfather Series, just read one of the in depth reviews of the actual film. This set though is nice and worth it if you get a good deal like I did.I will say though, this is an older film and isn't laser sharp like new movies on Blu Ray. Just be aware, it fits your screen perfectly, has been restored, has great sound, but it isn't like watching Toy Story 3 in Blu Ray..."
5,Great Collection!,"Okay im gonna just say it, ive never seen any godfather movie, ever! But this collection was so cheap (25 bucks when i bought it about) and so tempting i though heck, ive got to see this apparent classic sometime, and ive never been more pleased! Great packing, great early delivery, and great movie set, i give it two thumbs way up!"
4,3rd Hand Contractor Poles,"The product itself seems to be very handy, although when I received the package, one of the stands were broken, missing a part and one broke a handle the first time I used it, the plastic handle did not handle a 120lb cabinet before it broke, they say it can handle up to 400 lbs."
3,"Helpful, could be better","These have been very helpful, my only real complaint is that thepins that you push in to make large changes in length (1 foot at a time I think)are really hard to push, and then it can be tricky to get them tofind the holes that they lock into. So, you almost need a third handto use the third hand."
4,works good,This item works fine. The bag is too short though. You have to take the caps off in order to get them all in the bag.
4,Variable Ease of Use,One of the items is very hard to push in to adjust in length. Great product in general.
5,Love these,"I needed a way to keep dust in the work area and out of the non-work area and these more than serve that purpose. Very good quality and useability factor is very high. I've got another half dozen ideas for how to use these. Although a part was missing, I called Fastcap and they replaced it quickly - and included a free accessory for my trouble - a sign of very good customer service. I really like the way they thought out the included storage bag - a must if you have more than two poles and associated accessories. Keeps everything in one place and easily stored."
4,Useful tool; but all parts of pack don't fit in supplied bag,"Useful tool. I bought the 3rd hand contractor pack thinking that the bag would be useful to put away everything in the pack, in one place. Turns out that the four units do not fit in the bag - the bag is too small. No way for the four supplied UniversalFOOT (UniversalFEET?!)to fit in there. Would have been nice if they had made the bag bigger so you could actually get all the stuff in, and conveniently.The 3rd Hand is a 5, but this rating is overall for the contractor pack, since the bag is of no use to me."
1,"good idea, poor execution","The idea for this product is good, but the execution is terrible. Adjusting the poles is so cumbersome and difficult, it makes me not want to use the product. Very poor design."
1,weak construction,"If this product is used to hold plastic as dust barriers, it is great. It has great portability, looks good and compacts well into carry case. However, the first use one jack handle broke off and I bent the pole of another. It appears that parts are not interchangeable (wanted to fix the broken jack handle iwth the one off the pole, but couldn't figure out how."
1,Had to return after shipment,"Never got a chance to use this product. The shipping container appeared undamaged and inside each part was very well packaged. I unboxed each pole one at a time and one, two, three were all damaged by broken plastic pieces that held the bottom portion to the leg. I never bothered opening the fourth.Did not want to take chances by replacing with a new one so I guess I'll just keep shopping."
5,Good Buy and a great tool,"This thing is great! I created a plastic wall for a kitchen remodel and saved my house from becomming a dust ball. I also found that it was easy to reconfigure the wall when needed during the demo work. Another handy use was installing the remodel style high hat lights. I used one unit to hold the light tight into the cieling so I could set the clips and lock the fixture in place. If you have ever tried this in a plaster (1"" thick) cieling you know how hard this is. The 3rd hand did the trick. I have read some complaints about the tool bag included with the contractor pack. I found that everything fit nicely into the bag. As long as you pop off the feet (they pop off really easy by the way) they slip right in allong with all of the accessories."
3,"Great ""concert"" video, disappointing series retrospective","Although fans' hopes aren't completely crushed since this DVD is a great mini-concert-retrospective of some of the show's best moments, including performances by INXS as well as the rockers, and key moments such as their arrival and the partying, my expectation was for this to be a collection of all the episodes in the series.It's a nice montage of memories but one hopes that sometime the whole series, in its entirety, will be released. After all, the past and future of INXS came together on this show as well as a possible launching pad for some great solo careers. Three stars for the music since you do pay more for an album than ten bucks, but I was disappointed."
1,Disappointment!,I was looking forward to the complete series also. To say this is a disappointment is an understatement! I would have gladly paid at least $50 to see the whole thing plus commentary and special features! I was looking forward the the reality segments the most. I hope the producers take note of the reviews here and consider putting out a comprehensive collection.
2,Save your money!,"Although I enjoyed watching ""Rock Star INXS"" over the summer (America and the band got it right by picking JD Fortune), this piecemeal compilation doesn't cut it with me at all.The performances were generally fantastic, but some of the extras really stunk (except for the mini-concert). Shame on CBS and Mark Burnett!!!"
4,Wanted More but at this price....,"you get plenty. Yes, I would have preferred the entire season of RS:INXS on DVD with plenty of extras. Buuutt...for $10 this is a great buy. It was worth the $10 just to see the ""mini"" concert by INXS! (AWESOME!!!!)Personally, I enjoyed each of the stage performances better this time around (without thinking about the competition). I also enjoyed each of the bonus features, but did find the photo slideshow a bit lacking. My favorite extras were the casting interviews and the Too Hot for TV. (Word of caution to those with children- If your child enjoyed RS:INXS and wants to see this DVD, please screen it first. Some scenes and language are not suitable for children.)Overall, if you enjoyed the RS:INXS series, you will enjoy this DVD. Even though you'd prefer it all, ten bucks is a bargain for this material."
1,It's all about $$$,"...and the almighty dollar. Don't give the people what they want, but slap together a half-assed DVD of the RockStar series just in time for Christmas. Ah yea, Christmas gift idea to line MB's pockets. Hm. Don't think I'll take them up on this offer."
3,Not what it should've been,"OK, so I feel a bit screwed. I thought by waiting SIX YEARS, they would have come out with a dvd package of all the episodes from the series. Even with the first INXS concert with JD, their audition tapes and a few moments of behind the scene stuff that either was or wasn't included in the first airings of the episodes were a bit butchered. For example, JD's birthday party. All they showed was what wasn't aired. They also included only 17 of the 149 songs were done on the show. Total ripoff there, and most of the extras that were aired at the beginning of the show and between the songs wasn't there as well. I would have gladly paid for all the episodes in their entirety with all the behind the scenes and extras.For what it's worth, the dvd in of itself is great, but not as great as it could have been. So, now, the production company needs to get off their asses and get it together. It's been 6 years. Besides, it's not like it wouldn't sell."
5,Awesome video of the people from the show,This video has some great behind the scenes looks at the show and the performers. It also has great perfromances from the show and has some great intros. Definitely a must for any INXS fan.
1,Why????,"I can't believe MB and CBS decided to release a ""condensed"" version of the show on DVD. I was so excited when I found out a DVD of the show was scheduled to be released in the near future. I naturally assumed it would be the complete season and so I deleted the shows saved on TIVO. BIG MISTAKE!!!! I had no choice but to buy the complete season on EBAY for $49.99. Too bad CBS and MB will not see a penny of my money."
1,THIS IS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I would have gladly paid a high amount of money for the complete (unabridged) set of RockStar shows - which means the reality segments would have needed to be included as well. But this 'blah' offering by Burnett and INXS? No, thanks... I'll gladly skip this video travesty! Such an incredibly demeaning attitude and 'slap in the face' to all of the original rockers - most especially the brilliantly talented MIG AYESA... who was truly the overwhelming fan favorite and certainly was the most versatile, skillful and dynamic of all the RockStar contestants!! Save your money for something worthwhile - I know I'll be saving mine..."
1,We were ROBBED!!!!!!!!!!!,"What the &%@$ with this 'highlight' DVD - HOW DARE THEY NOT RELEASE THE ENTIRE SEASON!!!! And who the heck thinks that THOSE GUYS could possibly decide what to include in the 'highlights'?!? I don't want just 'highlights' - I want the whole enchilada dammit!!!Shame on me for not keeping every single eppy on my TiVO - I shoulda KNOWN this would happen! When I read that there would be a DVD, I ASS-U-ME(d) that the DVD would have ALL the episodes! Who releases a TV show DVD that doesn't include ALL THE SHOWS?!?!? This is absolutely ridiculous! Burnett's ""The Apprentice"" DVDs have all the shows - why on earth won't THIS one????I'll give my $50+ to someone on eBay if this is the kind of dribble the 'legit' DVD is going to be. INXS, Burnett, powers-that-be... YOU BLEW IT ON THIS ONE!!!!Me vewy vewy ticked!!!!"
4,Behind the scenes classic!,I was looking for a DVD of the actual series but stumbled upon this instead.I has all the great songs that they sung plus some really cool behind the scenes stuff.Great to see that they are human and can get drunk and have fun just like the rest of us.JD in particular was really good.
1,RockStar DVD,"I cannot express how disappointed I am that they have chosen not to include the whole season with all shows including the VH1 segments and all interviews. I missed the first episodes and did so want to see all of them. And then to have only 2 performances by the most magnificent talent of the whole series-Mig Ayesa-is pure idiocy! I was already saving my money, anticipating the DVD set to be pricey, but was willing to spend almost any amount on the complete set. Now I will not be purchasing it at any price"
1,What a RIP OFF!!!!!!!,"Who's bright idea was this??? Put out a DVD on a SEASON of Rockstar and then only have ""highlight"" performances???? HOW STUPID IS THAT?! I'll stick to my own ""homemade"" DVD thank you very much!RIP OFF!!!!JEERS to the IDIOTS of CBS, Mark Burnett...or whoever decided to put out this piece of garbage!"
2,incomplete...,"this DVD is a recap of a series - when they could have put together the entire series and charged 29.99 per and made more $ and made customers happier. But most notable is that the very deserving winner, J.D. Fortune, who's rock star looks and style as well as his perfect vocals, had actually developed in front of the camera during this series. From his interpretation of California Dreaming, to his leaving his team to write the #1 single Pretty Vegas (#1 in Canada) by himself...the series is a chronicle of the making of one of music's newest stars, and Burnett and his series can take the credit. But he should share this with the many fans that will want to see it for themelves."
4,I forgot how much I liked this show,"I picked up this DVD on a whim -- it was cheaply priced. My wife and I are fans of INXS and watched the entire series when it aired.The DVD reminded me how much I enjoyed the show's performance portion. I don't miss the whole shows at all, but I would have preferred that this DVD included all the performances, not just a sample -- even Dana and Daphna's.That Ty's early-season rendition of Heartbreaker is absent is a minor crime, and I would have liked to have seen some of the ""sing for your life"" performances.The extras are not anything special, except for the five song set from the new INXS after JD was named the winner.Not bad for the money if you liked or never watched the show."
4,Expectations,THis product was not quite what I expected it to be. I thought they would have all the performances. There are people who are not even on here. The performances that are on here are good and it was still a good buy but it was not what I was expecting so I was a little disappointed.
4,If you are an INXS Fan...,"If you are an INXS Fan you have to buy it, but It's not what I was expecting in the DVD, I thought I would be able to see more of the program not just a few songs from just a few singers. I wanted interviews with the members of INXS, there are non, and the most important part when they picked JD is not in the DVD. But you can see a concert, their first concert with JD. Kinda fun a few mistakes of JD's first presentation.Some jokes and JD naked shhhhhhhhhh, yes naked ladies LOL.Enjoy"
5,the best of mc A.D.E.!!,I own this from a time when there were no cds and it is a great edtion for the bass lover/ADE fan.
5,THIS IS THE BASS,"This is a must have if your old school I had this on tape before cd's and it was kicking than had to replace bcause someone stole it. I'm thumping again,lol"
3,Book review,Deeply theoretical take on public policy. Students of public policy should find this book to be very helpful.
2,Unraveled,"Firstly, the smallest size is way small- not the company's fault, but I thought I'd mention it for future buyers. My small-med breed dog is 12 pounds and it was a little teeny for her. Second, she got the knot out in about 5 minutes. So it went from box to dog to trash in less than 10 minutes. Not really worth the money. This is not a toy for any dog that is remotely smart, or is a chewer. Its too smooth, so the knots unfold easily. Your dog will figure it out in 5 minutes."
5,Very Helpful book!,This book has been very helpful to my husband and I. We are reading the book and doing the workbook at the same time. It as been a great starter for many conversation that we might not have otherwise talked about. Really made us evaluate ourselves and each other. For example do you get upset while driving. He said no and I said yes. Helped me to explain that when he gets upset it is very stressful for me.
5,My Grandson liked it.,"Cameron read this book immediately! He is reading these books in order, and he is 9 years old. I am very pleased to help him to get the books he wants."
2,"Ill drawn, lacking in entertainment","Poor plot and worse characterizations left me studying this novel as a lesson in how NOT to write good fantasy. It is more puzzle than novel; a prophecy is introduced (we know not from where) and we are to guess its hidden meaning before the 'climactic' ending explains its metaphors, the entire solution laid out in great detail during the denouement as a detective would explain a murder at the end of a mystery novel. The pattern is repeated twice more in the sequels, with no value added."
1,forget anything TOKYOPOP brings...,TOKYOPOP doesn't know anime and transform it into uglyness. Pioneer at least keep the original score and characters' names for their animes.
5,"PLEASE, RELEASE THIS FILM IN VIDEO!","As other reviewers, I have looked for the video version of this film to find that it isw not available. What a dissapointment! I think this is a lovely film, with a lot of humour and light, which nevertheless it's not light in its content, as it shows how stupid war is (these italian soldiers lost in an idilic greek war are informed one day by someone arriving from the outside that their former enemy is now their ally!) Lovely film, definitively a must, and among my ten favourite films."
3,Warning -- this is chopped off Full-Screen format,"Mediterraneo is a wonderful movie, and I had been wanting a copy for a long time . . . but not this one. It's cut down to narrow screen format, which just ruins the composition. It is set in a remote Greek isle, and part of its charm is the panoramic vistas."
5,beautiful escapist entertainment,"the movie opens with the line ""dedicated to everyone who is running away"" and then proceeds to take us on a 90 minute vacation. a group of misfit italian soldiers during WW II are ""trapped"" on a beautiful greek isle populated with only women and children (the greek men are off fighting the war). At first they try to escape and return to the war, but soon fall in love with the island and it's people. a beautiful, gentle comedy. Ideal for the hedonist and the romantic."
3,Mainly for adults,I read all the fabulous reviews for this film/ I was a little disappointed. It was an ok film but I did not see the beautiful scenery etc that was mentioned in the reviews I read.Also the subject matter was a little risque
5,Captain Corelli's Mandolin's scene setter,"The similarity in location, time and events with ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"" by Louis de Bernieres make this film the ideal accompaniment. I wish I could purchase the video, but it is no longer available."
5,A beautiful film...,"This jewel of a movie sends a powerful message in the gentlest of ways. Heartwarming and sweet, it is one of my absolute favorites."
4,mediterranean delight!,"i love this film. everyone is tanned and the location in greece is so beautiful, it distracts from the plot. most of all, i love the score-for anyone who wants to escape for a little while!"
2,"Not sci-fi, would have made a nice short story","I purchased this book thinking that it was going to be an interesting science fiction story. It is definitely not sci-fi, nor is the story particularly interesting. It is more of a mystery/thriller that happens to involve Da Vinci going forward in time mysteriously (it just sorta happens). The author's take on how Da Vinci adapts to 1980's Canada is not bad, but could have been explored more deeply. The whole caper with Sparo Aeronautics is run of the mill fare. And the author's fascination with dorm-mates bathing and drinking together naked is just plain weird.300 odd pages later it might have made a fine short story."
5,Leonardo's Flight,"I enjoyed Leonardo's Flight. It is a lot of fun and quite interesting. The characters are very entertaining and of course, Leonardo was enchanting. The story was very well researched and I particularly enjoyed the group of friends and their antics.I believed that this was going to be a ""guy"" book but I was mistaken. I highly recommend it to my girlfriends. I congratulate the author on a book well written and amazingly entertaining. Reading Leonardo's Flight has made me a fan of the author and I look forward to his next venture."
5,Kept me on the Edge of my Seat,"IF YOU'LL LOOKING FOR A ROMANCE NOVEL WHICH DOESN'T HAVE ANY OVERLY GRAPHIC SEXUAL PARTS THIS IS IT! I bought this book after I read the copy from my church library because I wanted to keep it. I read the book in three days I was so eager to find out what happened next. Not only did the story keep me on the edge of my seat to see the romance come about, but the poetic way the author described the characters, how they felt about each other, and their rich relationships with other characters made it a very charming, relaxing, and enjoyable book. The characters are so real, rich, and very easy to relate to on a basic level. It also had some deep messages about being married, losing a spouse, and falling in love. It's such great love too."
5,"John Butman's ""Townie"" is a great read","What a delight this book is!In a voice entirely his own, and with terrific humor and great sympathy toward his oddball hero, John Butman engages us in this original tale of relationships, power, loyalty, love, business dealings, responsibility, and fine men's shoes. Butman is a careful observer of people. He's particularly good at noting the small details, usually passed over, that make a situation or character, no matter how far-fetched, come alive.This unusual (and very funny) story of improbable coincidences, and contradictory and conflicted characters, is one that provided great pleasure to this reader. I eagerly look forward to what John Butman does next."
5,The best book I've read in years!!!,"I understand that ""Townie"" is up for the Pulitzer Prize AND the National Book Award. If I were judging it would win both! I was reading it at stop lights. Funny, provocative, engaging. Great story telling. Completely unpredictable. I'm enjoying it even more the second time. Mr. Butman went mining for magic and he struck the mother lode."
3,Should get more for the price.....,"What has happened to Columbia? I used to love their merchandise. It seems they have scaled back on material but have not scaled back the price. This item is stylish and well put together, but not at all warm. The fleece is super thin and does not work well as a standalone. If you intend to layer several of these together, then you might like it, but for the price, it's just not a great bargain...."
1,Tearing at collar after only 3 months of wearing...,I purchased this for my fiance at the end of Dec 2010 and gave it to him as a gift at the end of Jan 2011. It is now April 2011 and the collar is already tearing. It won't be long before there is a huge hole. I believe Columbia products should last longer then this epecially since he only wears it casually he does not wear to work or anything. I contacted Moontree and they said there is nothing they can do because you only have 30 days to return something. I will not purchase products through that seller again.
2,Sizing was off,"I got this really hoping it would fit. I got a large, since I'm a pretty tall guy. I'm 6'3 and I put on the jacket and it didn't even go past my waste. I think they need to re-do their sizing chart. Very disappointing."
3,thin but okay,"The material is a little bit thin compared to my friend's who has the same brand jacket. I was a little disappointed but it still works alright. The zipper is also a little hard to catch on for some reason, it doesn't go up easily."
4,What You See is What You Get,"I'm not sure I would call it tusk but it is neutral so it will go with my clothing.The sizes are always larger or feel larger which I appreciate. It's roomy without being overwhelming.I love fleece. This is machine washable, I just wish I knew what the drying instructions were. But it is soft, light without being too thin and warm yet not too warm or too heavy. I will buy another."
5,jacket,"We all love these jackets. My husband, son, daughter in law and grand son and myself all have 2 of these jackets. Great for AZ weather."
2,Customer Service Run-Around,"The product was fine, but it took forever to receive my shipment, and did not come as promised even after talking with their customer service."
2,broken within a month,"I know the Columbia brand, and trust the products they manufacture. It could be, then, that my experience was a fluke..BUT I bought this jacket for my father for Christmas. He started wearing it mid-January, and before the end of January, the zipper pull had broken off. So he couldn't zip it shut at all. So he stopped wearing it. I contacted the seller, and got great customer service. I am in the middle of the exchange process, and trust that it will go smoothly. I'm not sure if others have had the products break so soon after purchase, but mine did...Good luck!"
3,not as advertised,Sweater is just as the black one I purchased years ago. It is comfortable and doesn't fade with repeated washings. It is warm and easy to layer with other clothing and the sizing is spot on. The only complaint I have is that the advertised picture shows a brown collar on the ranger color of sweater. That is not in fact what I got. There was no brown collar inside or out.
5,columbia fleece review,"this product was exactly what we ordered it was for my son. he wears it all the time. i have one also, they are very warm, and i like them because they are not so bulky."
2,"Bad, bad ""China's Columbia"" !","I'm from Russia. Some weeks ago i bought these Fleece Sweater on Amazon.com. It's made in Vietnam. Thread sticking everywhere(( I can send you photos, write to greengel@yandex.ru. Sad, I just wanted buy good quality Columbia, but got ""bad Vietnam"". Also, i bought/got bad Bugaboot Plus Snow Boot ""Columbia"" from China! I wrote about this also.If you want to buy this firm, be careful - forgery is everywhere in this mad world... Sad."
3,Made in China,"I have always loved these sweaters. They are warm and cozy.I was disappointed that this company, based in the Portland, OR area, has these sweaters made in China. On the last one I ordered, the zipper is flawed, doesn't zip easily at all.Also, I ordered 2 of them and they came from 2 different stores, so I had to pay two ten dollar shipping fees."
5,Very Nice,This was the same as one I had previously bought in a store. This one was much warmer and seemed to block the wind more. Very nice!
4,columbia men's fleece,"This is a warm, well-made fleece. The fit is consistent with the indicated size. My only concern is that the actual color is different than how it appeared on my computer screen."
5,Good Fit,"After returning the extra large, my husband likes his new fleece jacket and the large fits him well. He is close to 6' tall and weighs just under 200 lbs."
2,Lint Problem,"These jackets are light and nice to look at. However, they have a serious lint problem. I wore this to work on a white shirt and I was horrified to see lint all over my white shirt! I am returning it now."
5,Excelent product,Excellent product I recommend it I am charmed with it.I recommend it. The sweter expires with the specifications. I loved
5,A family favorite,"So happy to find this item at Amazon (convenience + good price) & in many colors and sizes. It's a wonderful ""sweater"" -- a lighter weight fleece that can be layered and packs easily. My husband and I have had some for quite awhile and they continue to look and function well (no broken zippers, etc.). [And, yes, it can be unisex. Just get the right size.]I was recently updating my dad's wardrobe and it occurred to me that this sweater jacket would also be good for him. He is elderly and lives in a retirement home and sometimes gets chilly. His acrylic sweaters really do not offer much warmth. So I've ordered several for him. They will wash well and look great."
4,"Pleased, but left a little wanting","In general am very pleased, but find that the sizing just seems wrong. I am rather skinny for my height, so I was pleased to find that even in a medium this sweater was long enough to cover my torso and then some (important for the cold weather of course), and a good fit for my shoulders. It is however a lot baggier in the middle than I would have hoped. In the end it doesn't effect its funcitonality (AKA keeping me warm), but I fear that under tighter jackets and coats it might kind of get in the way and make a tight-fitting-coat into an uncomfortably-tight-fitting-coat.Pros:Good and warmLightweightVery soft (not scratchy at all)Spacious zip-close pocketsDraw-cord at bottom to keep the warmth inCons:A little too baggy for anyone with a concave figure (The seams go straight down and do not curve in at all like it shows in the product picture)"
4,Another well received gift,Great. It is worn when the weather turns cold. I am happy to wear it.The color is really good.
3,not happy,It wa much too large and I returned it and am very disappointed that I had to pay postage for the return.
2,Bad Fit - Bad Choice,"Bad fit, but I like the Tusk color. I thought this was going to be a sweater. It's like a Hike Jacket. I'm 6'3"" and normally don't require a tall size in extra large, but here I do. Then, an inside pocket is needed, since this really is a jacket. The zipper isn't lined up properly. That makes the fit even worse, when it's zipped up. I'll keep this one because I like the color and that's the only reason. I also ordered a grey, but it came with a broken zipper I couldn't get to zip. I returned it. This was a bad choice for me, since I'm taller, but I'll wear it around the house. It does provide warmth and I like the fleece feel."
1,Columbia Fleece,"I'm very disappointed to receive the jacket with a ""Made In China"" label. It feels cheap, it looks cheap....I won't be ordering anything more from your company.Sincerely,Damon"
2,Tusk is Not a Good Color,"My order came 3 weeks late. I took the advise of other buyers and bought a small size which is as big as my other medium size clothing. I was disappointed that I ordered a tusk color jacket which looks much whiter,fashion on the screen. In fact, it is a dirty silver grey color that I am embarrassed to wear it to my office, or anywhere. Even wearing it at home my wife asked me where I got it from a second hand store. Its warm though. The cuff has no elastic."
3,very thin fleece,"The jacket is nice looking, but the fleece is quite thin. It is not as cozy at it looks. It seems to be well made enough though."
3,Not up to Columbia standard,"Well,Say it isn't so...this jacket made in China is a little ""thin"" on the fleece...take the ""sweater"" adjective as true...not a jacket but truely a sweater. Previous Columbia products I've purchased had more weight to the fleece and were made in Vietnam...wish Columbia would have made this ""sweater"" there also...will use it to knock off the chill."
2,Decent but problem with zipper after 8 months,"I liked this jacket. It fit well. Was fairly warm and thin. Looked decent. But after 8 months, the zipper got stuck in the closed position for some unknown reason, forcing me to cut out my keys."
5,Perfect Fit,I like this fleece because it keeps me warm when the temperature is above fifty degrees.
4,great gift,"Bought this for my Father-In-Law. Color was perfect.Fit Was Great. And he loves the fact it can be thrown into the washing machine and dryer, and it comes out looking like new. He thinks he has a very smart Daughter-In-Law!!!"
2,Caveat Emptor,"I had purchased the same fleece at Academy Sports, and decided to get a second one, thinking this would be identical. The material in the one I received is actually much lighter, so think twice about purchasing something online that you can't inspect first."
2,Not fair,This is my second buy from Columbia...But this one has fleece problem...Because while skiving the stuff they made verev line ...So this is not FAIR...I think while controlling quality was eye off..I am sorry and I can't send you because I am living in Istanbul/TURKEY and will cost me...Maybe you can compensate this situation to my credit card...I hope and wait...But I advised those sweaters everybody....
3,not for use under 55 degree weather,"I just wore my jacket for the first time today and the temp is about 51 degrees outside.Although the jacket is nice and well made,i can feel the wind blow right through it and it sends a chill up my spine.This is definitely not made for low temps but rather just a dress sport jacket.It is nice to have zippers on the pockets but i just wish the jacket were made a bit heavier.If you not gonna use it for long periods of outside use in cold weather ,the jacket will be fine,however if you plan on staying outside for long periods of time in 50 degree or lower weather i suggest getting something else."
1,The pictures do not show the poor quality of the article,The pictures do not show the poor quality of the article.The pictures do not show the poor quality of the article
1,Not warm enough.,"This is not very warm enough. I bought so I can wear it inside office when they make AC too cool during summer, but I still don't feel warm. Also not warm enough during fall or spring."
3,Light and comfortable.,"The jacket is ok. Very comfortable, very light.The only issue is this piece of white cloth on the inside, behind the Columbia logo, in the inside part of the jacket."
2,Do not buy this jacket from here!,"I got this jacket for Christmas. It's awesome and all, except the logo is stitched on the wrong side of the jacket and I noticed the multiple layers of white backing used to stitch the logo patch in was still in there and very difficult to get out. I would recommend spending the extra $5-10 buying this same thing from the real website instead of buying it here. Really embarrassing to go around and wear a noticeable fake."
5,Great quality,"Columbia has great quality , and are very warm clothing. Would recommend Columbia to anyone who appreciates great quality clothing."
5,3rd purchase and loving it,I've owned this fleece for over two winters and its just great. I purchased it again for my father in-law as a gift. My wife even got another one for her grandfather. Awesome fleece. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. UPDATE: Now the 5th one in the family. I still have mine and got another one from work with the company logo on it.
3,Size runs large......terrible experience in trying to return,"The material of the jacket is good and the color was true to the picture atleast for the Cardovan color.I went for a Large size Fleece. It was way over size! I tried to return it to Rocky Mountain company. Their reply was that the jacket was washed, heavily perfumed and the tags were not on them. I did remove the tags but the jacket was not washed nor perfumed heavily. I think my integrity is more than $30 but i didn't feel like arguing with them. Anyways, next time i am going to think about buying something that is not sold by Amazon itself. All size 'outside' vendors are not reliable."
5,very satisfied,"excellent article, comfortable, warm, fitted, a great purchase; i had my doubts initially about the size but the information was accurate enough"
2,"Good at first, but fell apart","I liked this jacket when I first got it. It was warm and had a comfortable fit. Within a month, however, the sleeve started to rip off the body of the jacket. As it was past 30 days and I didn't have the original tags, packaging, etc., the jacket couldn't be returned. I understand that it wasn't an expensive jacket but it's Columbia, you would think that it would last more than 30 days before falling apart."
4,"Good Value, Warm and Light","This is a single-layer, lightweight, fleece jacket that is very comfortable.It has a sturdy elastic drawstring waist with an adjustable lock on either side. The front zipper goes all the way to the top of the collar creating a ""turtle neck"" when needed. The wrists are non-adjustable wide elastic. The pockets open vertically along the side seam, and both pockets have zippers. The fabric sags noticeably if keys or other heavy objects are placed inside. I just use the pockets as hand warmers.Although lightweight and a bit thin, it is unexpectedly warm and has stood up well to use. Mine shows some wear at the elbows and an ember from a campfire has singed a small area on one of the shoulders, but it still quite serviceable after using it regularly during the last fall, winter and spring."
1,Long sleeve fleece,The fleece was not densely woven enough to provide much warmth and the wind goes right through it. The fabric is kind of shaggy unlike any fleece I've ever had or seen. Last Columbia product that I'll try.
4,Nice for the price but be aware of the color and size,"I think this product is OK for the price, (I paid less than $30) but my advice is to be aware of the color, I requested the light grey or light metal one and the one the send to me is some kind of opaque grey with blue, about the size I asked M because I knew about the sizing problems, I use to wear Large and M was perfect for me. The feeling is fine, and is in fact warm and feels nice and very light."
1,Horrible Zipper Falls Off,"Nice sweatshirt. Terrible zipper. Bought 4 of them, and 2 of them had zippers fall off within a couple months."
1,Crappy quality,"This showed up with holes. Very poor quality. Not what I expected from a Columbia product, as usually they have pretty high quality products. Very disappointed and sent it back."
4,Nice Jacket,My son likes his coat. It fits really good and looks classy on him. It is good quality and the size is a true medium.
2,Zipper not working,"It's my 2nd fleece from Columbia. I bought previous one couple of years ago, and I liked it, so decided buy second one as first is too old. This time I received damaged item - zipper is not working. Unfortunately for me, but I'll give 2 stars for Columbia, so they can work on their QA..."
4,"Nice Jacket, Baggy Sleeves",The material is good and the waist is fitted nicely. The sleeves however are really baggy. They are almost twice the width they need to be.
3,Wind blows through! Keeps you warm for indoors only.,"This Steens jacket looks smart on me. Size Small fits me well, though I am 5ft7inches tall, chest 35"" and waist 37"". Enough room inside to wear a fleece sweater under it because this jacket fabric does not keep out the wind, even July 2012 in San Francisco! Jacket length covers up to mid point between waist and hip, just as shown in the model photo. The fleece weave is not as tight and smooth as my REI jacket which cost $55. It looks more like a fluffy teddy bear.I bought this Stenn jacket hoping to use it as casual outdoors jacket for day and night, but because of its inability to keep out the wind, and the winds on hilly areas of San Francisco are always unpredictable, this jacket is now only limited to indoor wear. Hope this feedback is useful."
2,dirt magnet,This item literally collects all the dirt around. It gets dirty easily. The material also shrinks when washed. Order another brand or texture. It also fades
5,Just right!,"I needed a fleece jacket. I saw this on Amazon, read the existing reviews, and decided that it was just what I needed for layering for gulf coast up and down winter temps.! Thank you to Amazon and those who had previously reviewed the jacket. It's perfect!"
4,good,"This catch hair jacket frivolous breathe freely, put on will feel very comfortable. But not the windshield, the cold weather outside or to want to add a coat."
4,!!,Fast and easy shipping! I haven't even opened the package yet and I'm already satisifed! Thank you so much!! I bought the jacket as a gift for someone else! I'm sure they will love it!!
3,thinner than i expected,i thought i was buying a midlayer but its not. its pretty thin. maybe can be worn by itself on chilly fall day. BEsides that i liked it. very lightweight.
5,What a wonderful CD!,"As one of Suzanne's greatest fans, I must say ""History of my Heart"" has to be one of the best compilations in this artist grandiose career!"
3,Excellent product,"The liquid form of glucosamine chondroiten appears to be utilized more fully than the capsule form, I noticed good results within 5 weeks."
5,Worked in 24 Hours,I've been taking Glucosamine for about a year now because of shoulder and hip joint pain and stiffness in pill form. After about 2 weeks it worked pretty dang good and the pain went away. I ran out 2 weeks ago and kept forgetting to get more until the old pains came back with a vengeance. I bought a bottle of Wellesse Joint Movement Glucosamine w/Chondroitin and within 24 hours the pain COMPLETELY disappeared.I volunteer at the local library and stretching to those top shelves was difficult. Today the top and bottom shelves were no longer off limits to me. I'm serious here - I don't have a medical degree but I know when something works - This stuff works!
2,Awful taste,"I'm a firm believer that liquid medicines & supplements absorb in the body faster than pills. However this stuff tastes HORRIBLE. I tried some of the tips/tricks other reviewers suggested to make it a little more palatable (mix with seltzer water, dilute with water, add to juice, drink water immediately after taking it etc), I just can't stomach it. Back to pill form for me."
5,Love this story!,I remember this story from when I was a child. Now it is one of my children’s favorites too! Teaches colors and imagination.
2,Still a good book.,"Unfortunately, this isn't the full-sized book I remember from my childhood (it's a rather cheap imitation that probably won't hold up to multiple readings). But the pictures and story are still the wonderful ones I remember."
2,Another poor adaptation,"This is my favorite book of Jane Austen. It is written from a place of maturity and deals with more serious difficulties than some of her previous works. It also seems to be the hardest one to transfer to film. I have never seen a well done version, and this fits that pattern. Although not nearly as bad as some others, it still completely misses the mark."
2,Too fragmented. Doesn't hold a candle to earlier production starrint Francis O'coonner. Won't,"Doesn't hold a candle to earlier production starring Francis O'coonner, whaich was a smooth adaptaation of comedy and romance from Austen's letters and book."
2,"Love Mansfield Park, but not this modern soap opera version","This version cheapens the great work of Jane Austen. I couldn't get through all of it. I am a huge fan of Jane Austen and most adaptations of her work, but this just felt like a modern day, cheap soap opera version. The dark eyebrows with bleached hair is only one of many examples. Too bad. I always look forward to a new version to watch. Too bad this one is not worth watching."
3,Cute,"Cute and fun, but anyone who has read the book and enjoyed it will have issues. Billie does an okay job as Fanny, but doesn't capture her character wholly. Still cute, but not true to book."
5,Interesting take on this complex book,"At first I wondered at the choice of Billie Piper, but as I got into the movie it began to make sense. Worthwhile addition to my Jane Austen collection."
2,Was this Mansfield Park?,"I love this story, and I don't necessarily expect film adaptations to be faithful to a novel in every detail. However, this film is so strangely cobbled together that I think if I didn't know the novel so well I would have had no idea what was going on. Motivation, character, and relationships need to be developed even if they diverge from the original, but the characters here were mostly two dimensional, and inconsistent. The sets, costumes and cinematography were only so-so - these are elements that can make up for a lot if the viewer is looking for pleasant entertainment. Sadly, even that was lacking.I'm not sure what this was supposed to be, but Mansfield Park it was not!"
4,A faithful adaptation.,Jane Austen devotees should be pleased with this Masterpiece adaptation of one of her longer novels. My only personal disappointment is in the choice of Billie Piper for the quiet and sober Fanny Price; otherwise I thought the casting excellent.
1,BBC Mansfield Park,"Staid and not well casted, slow-moving pace. BBC does some things brilliantly but this was not one of them, unfortunately."
2,SMASHED BLOCKED,"Brought this,to have midsummer nights scene on cd.So I would not have to keep getting my lp out and playing it. Boy was I dissapointed with the cd collection poor sound reproduction on all of the tracks sounds like they have tried to convert mono to stereo on some of the tracks especially on midsummer nights scene and completly failed and ruined the song. If you want this groups stuff on cd I suggest you by the jagged time lapse release which is much better regarding sound and quality, and is a good edtition to collectors of obcsure british pop psych."
1,I was disappointed of this book a lot~~,"I was disappointed of this book a lot~~There are only letteres, NO photos.It's hard to understand easily about contents of this book."
4,Fantastic reference for stage hair!,"This book has been an invaluable resource for our period play productions as well as a wonderful reference for the general public who want that ""period"" look for presentations, skits, and parties"
5,THE book to buy...,"If you're a hair-designer (or a costumer) for the theatre, this is an invaluable resource. There's nothing else like it... and that's why it costs what it does. The truth is- it's worth it:As a ""quick reference"" it's faster, easier, more specific, and much more reliable than searching the INTERNET (and that's saying a LOT)...While, as an ""in-depth reference"" it's also a great resource- with articles explaining the history -and significance- of developments in Men's AND Women's hairstyles.Note: This book is amazing for historical research and inspiration -however- It does NOT claim to teach you HOW to recreate these hair styles... you need to do that on your own!"
3,I was right in high school,"Okay, the whole truth is I grabbed this free e-book because I blew it off in high school English.I alway wondered what I missed (I squeezed a B- in the course). I can't remember what I did insteadof reading RBoC, but I was right. The book was okay, but no To Kill a Mockingbird."
5,great book,"never saw the movie, never read the book, got a kindle, saw it was free, and could not put it down!!!!!"
4,The second chance,"This is a classic I may or may not have read before. It contains many usable quotes concerning war, courage, and redemption."
3,Not great,"When I began to read this novel, I had expected Stephen Crane to take me into the Civil War completely. While he does provide ample imagery and creates a good setting, I felt that he was unable to capture my imagination and place me in the midst of the action. Henry, the main character, is delineated as a young boy that undergoes a transformation throughout the novel, but I was unable to identify with him. His thoughts and actions seemed unrealistic, perhaps because I could not view him as a human being, but rather as a fictional character. The novel itself is short, and fell beneath my expectations, however, it did provide for a decent read, and not difficult in the least bit. If you're looking to read a short novel about the Civil War and do not wish to get into the details of the war, but are rather interested in a soldier's perspective, (which is not too extensive either), then The Red Badge of Courage is a good choice."
3,Interesting,"This book follows a young man who dreams of being a hero in epic battles, like the ones he had read since childhood. In his blind dream he enlists in the army, and immediatly faces the real circumstances of war, and faces many fears.The irony in this story is excellent. This boy goes from a ""youngin"" as he is noted throughout the novel, to a real hero. It inspires and motivates. Although it's a good book, it was hard to get through, but I'd suggest reading it because you may not like it, but you'll respect it."
3,My book review,"The Red Badge of Courage is a book about Henry Fleming's journey through the Civil War. When Henry joins the army he is confident and thinks it will be an amazing adventure, but once he sees the war with his own eyes he is more scared than confident. The book doesn't really have any action, it is mostly about Henry just walking throught the woods thinking about what to do. But it's a pretty good book if your into the Civil War. The battles go into a lot of detail to make the book have a little more action, but the action in the book is still very limited. The book would have been better if it had gone into more details about other characters in the book. Although the characters in the book are very believable and this helps the story seem more true. So if you're into action and adventure books , I would say this is not the book for you, but if you're a Civil War enthusiast you might really enjoy this book, because of its accurate descriptons of the Civil War."
2,Overrated,"I do not believe that this book should be regarded as a classic.The novel tells about the adventures of a young soldier named Henry during the American Civil War, whose alacrity for fighting in the army soon fades as he is faced with the real horrors of war. Every other soldier the protagonist fights with, instead of being given a name, is labeled with an adjective such as 'loud soldier' or 'tall soldier'. Whilst I accept the author was trying to show the reader how anonymous the people you fight with are in a war, it also meant that the characters came across as flat and uninspiring, and the reader never gets to know or understand them.Although I have not enjoyed other classic works of literature in the past, I have always been able to see past my opinions and understand why they are regarded so highly. I did not feel that with this book at all. The prose was dull, the style did not engage me at all, and I am still struggling to understand why it is rated by so many people."
2,The Red Badge of Courage,"My name is B.S.M and I am in the 8th grade. I just read Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane and I thought it was not very good because personally I am not very into books about war and viloence. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a young boy named Henry who goes out and fights in the Civil War. In this book, I enjoyed the part where Henry grabs the Union flag from the dieing General because it showed Henry proving himself and making up for when he fleed in the beginning of the book. If I could change anything in this story it would be that the tall soilder dosen't die. I do not recommend this book."
2,The Red Badge of Courage: Stephen Crane's masterpiece,"People say that The Red Badge of Courage is Stephen Crane's best piece of writing. Personally, I think that if The Red Badge of Courage is his best, then he shouldn't have been a writer. The Red Badge of Courage had no action. The entire book was detail. Nothing but detail, and that made it boring. This book was a war oriented book. Stephen Crane should have put some more action in the book, because that's what war is, action. Stephen Crane just described Henry's battles, but if I wrote the book, I would have placed Henry at the battle. I'm not slamming the book. It was okay at some times. I knoe it must have took Stephen Crane a lot of thought and effort to come up with the detailed descriptions that he did. I would not recomend this book to a friend. It was really dull."
3,mediocre,"This story is about a young man named Henry who has enlisted in the Union army during the revolutionary war. It follows his thoughts and emotions during his first battle. It was only mildly interesting to me, and I kept putting it down and coming back to it after reading another book. I wasn't interested enough to keep at it for more than a few chapters at a time."
2,The Red Badge of Courage,"My name is C.G. and I am in the 8th grade. I just read Red Badge of Courage by Stephan Crane and I thought it was ok. The book took place during the Civil War and about a young solider, named Henry. Henry made excuses everytime he ran away or lie about something. In this book, I enjoyed the part where the loud solider, Wilson, changed his personality because the war had changed him and he is like a motherly figure now. If I could change anything in this story, it would be Henry because he questions his own character. I do not recommend this book for any girl. If you like a classic Civil War book, I think this is a story for you."
3,An 'okay' book,"The book is about a young ambitious soldier, Henry Flemming who craves for war. He goes into the American Civil War and is horrified by its harsh realities. All his dreams of becoming a hero is shattered and he is engrossed in a mental conflict whether he would stay in the battlefield and fight or run away.I for myself was disappointed to see the slow moving pace of the story and I even laid aside the book more than twice. `The Red Badge of Courage' will not satisfy those who are looking for accounts of conflicts and battles. The book mostly deals with the thoughts of Henry Flemming. You'll be able to know the thoughts, which grips a soldier when he is in a war, the taste of victory and defeat, the hardship troops have to go through for their country. This is a book for patient readers."
4,Pretty good!,"I love to read war books, and see war movies, because I have benn studying america's wars for a year and a half so far. anyway, I think this book is excellent! I like the characters, and I like the detailsBut if you plan to read this book get ready for some pretty boring parts and some boring details. and not to be a spoiler or anything but you have to wait a little while until the first battle begins.It has some good action sequences. I don't like that Henry (the main character) becomes a coward. But It is good for civil war fans. I liked this better than THE KILLER ANGELS because instead of showing strategy it shows the horror of battle, and how cold blooded you have to become to survive. I recomend this to anyone who likes the civil war!"
4,The Red Badge of Courage,I read the book The Red Badge of Courage. This book is great.This book takes place in the Civil War. It's about a young man fighting in the Civil War. He ran away from the first battle then learned from it.I learned some interesting facts reading this book. I learned that there is alot of blood in wars. I also learned that you had to face your fears in wars. The last thing I learned is when you do something wrong you can fix it.I would recommend this book for three reasons. You can learn alot about the Civil War. Also you learn what it was like to fight in a war. Last you would learn how it was to die in wars.The Red Badge of Courage is a very good book.
2,repetitious and needless words,"the book was wordy considering it was 1 plot that was dragged out. It really only held my interest for a while, thinking it would improve but did not."
2,"American, yes! Classic, no!","First things first. I found myself having a hard time understanding the language. I had my hopes up when I started to read this book but was very disapointed. I couldn't even finish the darn thing because it was so hard to read and the fact that it was boring didn't help either.I read chapter after chapter hoping it will get better but it turned out to be a disapointment from the start. We all know this is an American book, but who would claim it to be a classic, I can't understand."
3,A good book about the Civil War,"I read this book for school and it was kind of a boring book! It is about a young man in battle for the first time ever. He has to decide whether he will face his fear. He didn't face it right away, but ran from the battlefield scared to death. Finally he did get up the courage to face his fear and fights hard to the finish. A good but boring book, I did like it!"
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! POORLY WRITTEN!!! SOMEBODY GAG ME!!!,"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Don't read it unless your forcedto for a class. I had to read for 6th grade social studiessummer reading. One of the questions on the test was ""Do yourecommend this book for next year's summer reading?"" Isaid, ""NO"". Gag me please. Ew. A crime to literature. No realplot. Choppy Sentences. Poorly Written. Annoying names. Nameslike ""Tall Man"", and then when they were talking to eachotherthey use names like ""James"". Not a classic. Not a good bookwhatsoever. Do not read it. I get shivers thinking about it'sbadness. Ew. Ew. Ew!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Disguting,"When someone mentions the book Red Badge of Courage to me, it often results in intense vomiting and explosive diareah. The RBC gave me insight into a world of dullness and boredom. The disgusting plot led me to the conclusion that Crane must be an utter lunatic. There is absolutely no way that war could be as frighteningly dull as Crane portrays it to be. Overall, the book was so horrendously bad that it may have ruptured the very fabric of space and time with the sheer uncontrollable force of its filth."
1,OH MY GOD!!!,"THIS BOOK IS HORENDOUS, HORRIBLE, AND JUST PLAIN TRASH.EW. THIS BOOK DESERVES NO STARS, BUT YOU CAN ONLY GIVE ONE ATTHE LOWEST. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ****.IT IS STUPID."
2,Read this only when you have no choice,"The Red Badge of Courage is probably one of the worst books ever written. Despite the fact that this is the only Stephen Crane book I have read, I already have a very bad impression of the author and have no intention of reading any more of his books.The characters in this book are extremely underdeveloped, and Crane's way of reverting back and forth between actual names and descriptions such as ""Wilson"" and ""the Loud Soldier"" gets extremely confusing at times. I feel no real connection between the characters, and even when they died I felt no emotion whatsoever.Also, this book requires much more action than it contains. Most of this book is about Henry's inner struggles and his thoughts, most of which are about whether he should fight or run.Crane's style is also probably the most boring I have ever encountered. It is like a dull monotone, and I found myself dropping off to sleep as I read this.Do not read this book, much less buy it, if you can help it."
2,Boring and hard to understand,I really did not enjoy this book because it was very bland and everything had to have a description after it. I thin you should just stick to the basic ideas and express one clear thought in order to have a good story.
2,Why the fuss?,"A book chock full of wartime struggle, its great...if you like that sort of thing. To a reader unaccustomed to almost unbearably slow pace and metaphoric, confusing language, the book will bore you to tears.The first time I read the book was for a school requirement, but years later, it still bores me, even reading it on my own will. I do not reccomend it unless you enjoy these types of books. To the average reader, this will seem like a waste of time and a book who doesn't deserve it's classic standing."
2,Warning: Must like War Novels,"Red Badge of Courage is a civil war period novel using visual imagery and battles as metaphors for the maturing of a young soldier. Though considered a must-read classic, this short novel is overwhelmed with description and is confusing in indentifying characters (some simply have names such as the ""tall man"")."
3,This book is not an appropriate reading level.,"I am a 7th grade teacher who has a wide range of readers in my classes (4th grade to 10th grade reading levels). I was hoping I had found a copy of The Red Badge of Courage that could fit this wide range. When the books came in, though, I began reading it, and I was surprised at the difficulty in vocabulary that this text had. I have many 6th-8th grade readers who are having difficulties with it. I am disappointed with this text and this publisher for not accurately reflecting the age level appropriateness."
2,I dont find anything wrong with this book,"Everyone seems to not like this novel, however, I find it to be a wonderful example of anti-transcendentalism. The main character might be a little hot headed, but there is a reason for that. Steven Crane is trying to get an idea across to the reader that life is not always the way that you would like it to be, or what you thought it would be when you first went into a certain experience. I was required to read this novel for school and found it a very good contrast of Henry David Thoreau's work in Walden. Nathaniel Hawthorne has the same ideas behind Steven Crane's writing. Life is not always what you think it should be."
2,Not worth the two or three dollars,"Reading The Red Badge of Courage was almost as pleasant as getting body hair waxed. The novel by Stephen Crane, while having extensive and descriptive figurative language, lacked a thorough plot, one with a beginning, middle, and end. I suggest to the reader if they want to get any pleasure out of it, to read it on a very superficial and shallow level. Reading it for school only takes away from the book and causes the student to become distracted with the pointing out of all the figurative language and color descriptions. In my opinion, the only way to enjoy this piece is to read it as a young kid that way no analysis is going to take place."
3,The Red Badge of Courage,The red badge of corage is a good book that is about a war. A boy named Henry is enrolled in the army the book is about him trying to face his fears and fight. I only rated this book three stars because it takes a long time to start getting into the action they talk most of the book and don't fight as much as I had hoped it has a good moral but I thought it took to long to read
4,Honor & Courage,"Dear Readers, Stephens Crane's The Red Badge Of Courage, is a book about Henry Fleming who desires to fight in the Civil War. In his first battle, he flees in terror, but is disappointed in himself. He wants a wound, his own red badge of courage. In his second battle, his regiment charges bravely and thinks they have won. Then the enemy comes back only to get beaten again. Henry redeems himself and grows as a man and learns the values of war."
4,Interesting,I really enjoyed this book. mybe it is due to the fact that i enjoy war books alot. This for me was a fast read which ment I liked it. It was very good explaining the imagery and the colorful dialoge. It was on the civil war a war that I have not yet read on so it made it alot more interesting. I found it well done and light just a good book for a light reader that likes war and adventure.
4,A Good Read,"This book has been around for awhile but is still a good, scratch good, still a great read. I first read this book about 35 years ago (?)and this second read was probably even better. Well written and probably one of the few page burners that I have read in the last five years."
3,A good read,"Interesting, but not exciting. I had heard a lot about this book, but didn't enjoy it as much as I thought. It did present clearly the fears and sadness of war."
5,A classic of fog of war,The best thing e-readers have done with classic was to put them in a place of their own like a new age library.
2,"Too deep, wordy and difficult to understand",This book demonstrates the a perfect example of how a good writer can set back his career with one book. I read reviews of 11th graders reading this book and some said that it was too hard to understand. As an advanced 8th grader i too agree with these comments. I DO NOT reccomend this book to anyone that does not like poetic books or does not want to have to pay a great deal atttention to a book in order to understand it.
3,Facscinating and subversive,"The writer was heavy and the plot seemed unbelievably boring but I appreciate the work much more now after discussing it with my teacher and classmates. I now know that Crane was actually being very subversive. Because of the irony in RBOC, Crane can be interpreted as being anti-war. It also is an ironic comment about late 19th century boys' bookss and the fear that American men were becoming too effete because of over-civilization. The idea was that men needed to have visceral, barbarous experiences so American men could regain their masculinity and form a national identity as citizens of both moral and physical health (hence the concurrent development of PE and the professionalization of sports). Finally, Crane's analysis about the meaning of manhood is interesting: A boy is a man once he has been perceived as a man by other men (eg when Henry is seen fighting like an animal). I appreciate RBOC much more now that I understand it better."
2,Dated,"Since all the movies and novels and televisions shows about war and being a soldier have bombarded us, this novel seems dated.I can imagine how great this novel must have been, but since it is the 21st Century, there are many other more interesting and entertaining avenues to go down to learn about the horrors of war and being a soldier."
1,This book stinks,"I don't like any thing about this book except for the title. I can't even tell who is talking or what is happening.I didn't even know the main character's name until I read the back. It seemed like the author was reading a dictionary while writing this. I had to read it although I lost interest on the first page. It may be easier for older peaple to read, but I don't think any kid would enjoy this."
1,I HATED THIS BOOK WITH A PASSION,THIS BOOK WAS TOTALLY BORING. I HAD TO READ IT FOR SCHOOL AND IT TOTALLY BROUGHT DOWN MY AVERAGE BECAUS I WAS NOT THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU READ IT. AND IT IS NOT THE FACT THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE I READ SILAS MARNER AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.
1,They need to have negative ratings...,This book was awful. I have never had a book read for school be THIS bad. Awful. Simply awful.
2,Not great,"Stephen Crane never actually fought in battle in the civil war (I don't think he even visited a battlefield), and this novel reflects his personal inexperience. The book lacks comprehensive descriptions and relies too much on personificatin and ambiguity. The prose itself is mediocre and only detracts from the novel's themes.Personally, I wouldn't suggest reading this book unless it is a class requirement. The novel's few moments of excitment are not displayed well at all. It is disappointing to say that the ""Wishbone"" version of The Red Badge of Courage was more interesting than the actual book. Truthfully, the only reason why I think that the novel is critically acclaimed is because there was a lack of literature focused on the civil war written during the time period."
3,CONFUSING,"Red Badge of Courage was a very confusing book.When I was reading it, Stephen Crane used so much personificationthat it made my head hurt.Red Badge of Courage is abouta boy who goes off into trhe Civil War because of the excitementthat he sees in his town about the war. But, when he gets thereit's nothing that he thought it would be.This book is good but it's not great. Sometimes it will have you on the edge of your seat, and other times you will feel like not even reading it."
2,Confusing and Unrealistic,"This is one of my least favorite books ever. I was required to read it for school, and not only is it totally confusing and unrealistic, but the descriptions of battles and dead soldiers are repulsive. It stars a young man who wishes to gain his own ""red badge of courage,"" a battle wound, in order to ""prove"" his courage. This young man supposedly ""grows up"" after seeing the horrors of war, but, personally, his maturity seems rather debatable to me. For a better Civil War era book, I would recommend ""Killer Angels,"" or for another point of view, ""Gone with the Wind."" I think your time should be spent reading more valuble novels."
4,An Epic in a minute space,"I found the book ""The Red Badge of Courage"" quite impressive. I found it as a very interesting short novel. It was quite different from the long novels that i am used to reading. As many novels use many pages to convey its story and meaning, ""The Red Badge of Courage"" was able to do just that in such a small amount of space. The characters and dialogue were well thought out and vivid, creating an atmosphere in which you felt you were part of. The book conveyed the feeling of war and battle in a fashion i found very effective, as war is one of the things i am most interested in. The feeling of intense battle and warfare, with the bullets piercing the flesh of the soldiers whom destinies were carved by the guns of the enemies, was quite overwhelming at times, but created a brilliant atmosphere. I quite enjoyed the book as it was a nice read that didn't take too long, but was as effective as a full length novel."
2,Very boring and Very hard to read,"I have attempted to Read the Red Badge of Courage twice, both times resulting in giving up on the book. The word usage very stange and unless you have a dictionary next to you to look up words in every paragraph, your going to have a difficult time trying to understand the text. It may have been considerd a classic in its day but it doesn't hold much Relevance anymore especially compared to many other civil war books. Even as you get more into the book the plot is still satisfactory at best. I however grant it at least 1 star for historical accuracy. It does a pretty good job of keeping it realistic to what actually happend in the civil war. However if your not a great reader, or even for that matter if you are, I warn you against this book."
4,The Red Badge of Courage,It was exactly what I needed for my students. The price and quality were right for a classroom edition.
1,Another Bad Review,"I am not an impatient reader. I'm one of the few people who has read all three volumes of ""The Gulag Archipelago."" I even managed to complete the dreadful ""Turn of the Screw."" But I cannot finish this book. ""The Red Badge of Courage"" is the most put-downable book I have ever attempted to read."
1,Badly Written,"The only reason I can see for this book being a classic is its focus on the psychology of Henry the protagonist instead of the glory of war but even that is not done well. Maybe it is considered a classic because it was the first book about war to employ this strategy.The book is poorly written. The sentences are choppy. There is no flow, no lyricism and ultimately little point in any of it.If this manuscript was submitted today to any publisher it would be laughed at and thrown in the garbage. It is that badly written. Unless you're forced to read this for some class stay away. If you are a lover of great literature you will be greatly disappointed. I suggest Catch-22, Slaughterhouse Five, The Naked and the Dead, All Quiet on the Western Front, etc. Anything is better than this."
2,"It was an O.K. Book, But hard to understand",I picked this book to read thinking it would give me an idea of what happened during the civil war. If your not into war and things i donnot reccommend this book. To me it was boring and it wasn't interesting. But whatever baskets your ball eh?
3,Boring but interesting,I read this book in 5th grade and it is so boring but i only like the parts when the people die because that's the cool part. I recommend this book for people older than me and like when theres war
3,This was a well written book and i liked it,I think this was a really good book but it was a little hard for me to understand the conceept of the book as a 7th grade student. The author did a great job in showing what it was like and what soldiers had to go through. I would recommend this book to maybe a little older than middle school if you want to have a book that moves you inside.
2,Boring and monotonous book!,"This book was confusing and hard to read. Half the time I did not understand it and the other half I was bored to the core. The slang dialogue made me take time to figure it out. But, it did get exiting torwards the end of the book. The only reason I would recommend this book is so that we could share the torture."
3,Decent Book,"I am currently reading a book called The Red Badge of Courage written by Stephen Crane. So far this book is okay, butkind of boring. I like this book because it uses many figurativedevices throughout the book which makes it more interesting. I would reccomend this book to you if you wanted to know about the people or dialogue of that time period."
2,Red Badge of Courage-A classic,"My name is Colleen and I am in the 8th grade. I just read The Red Badge of Courage and I thought that it was a little boring and confunsing because of the Southern dialogue, and the slow storyline. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a young boy named Henry who desperately wanted to be a heroic soldier. In this book, I enjoyed the part where Henry joined the line of wounded soldiers, and found his friend Jim Conklin because it was good to see them find each other. If I could change anything in this story, it would be the way the dialogue is written, because it was sometimes hard to understand. I do recommend this book even though it was sort of slow. I recommend this book because I think that it is a classic book, and has been around for a while, and everybody should get a chance to read it."
2,Classic? Not in my book...,"The Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephen Crane, for me, was not entertaining. I found myself lost in most parts of the book. Crane is a very talented writer, he is very descriptive in his works, but I just do not prefer his writing style. If you prefer hemmingway-straight and to the point, you won't enjoy Crane's writing. Stephen Crane spends a lot more slower pace on his point making. Usualy taking a page to explain one thing. Another interested fact that I saw in Crane's writing was that he doesn't name specificly his characters. Instead he will use a characteristic that they will go by through the whole book. Again, I thought this book was very boring, and found my self drifting away from it. Hope this helps."
2,Another over-rated antiquity,"I had heard the praises of this book sung so many times, perhaps it was doomed to disappoint me. After wading through this convoluted and disorganized ""classic"", I was left with little but disbelief and a feeling of being cheated.Don't be mistaken; I understand that war in general (and in all likelihood civil wars more than any other) ARE convoluted and disorienting by nature. Nevertheless, this book utilizes disorganized, repetitive, and hollow sentences to describe, almost as if Crane were using the intrinsic qualities of the war itself as a crutch.I would only recommend this novel as a quick (couple of hours)route to teach readers to keep an open mind; that antiquated ""popular"" opinions should not be subscribed to blindly."
2,Overly Emotional and Poorly Structured,"This book was recommended to me by an employee at Barnes and Noble. The employee said it was very emotional and touching. They were correct. The characters in this book sign up for the Civil War hoping for glory, but realize the war is a horrible thing to experience. The characters in this dark romantic book over react to everything and become very bleak and gloomy. The book would only interest those looking to read about touchy children complaining about everything. The language used in the book is very unnatural and does not flow at all. This book is very similar to All Quiet on The Western Front except the characters are less captivating."
1,Complete waste of time,"I don't feel that I can adequately express my disdain for this book. I would rate it as one of the worst books that I have ever read. The main plot and theme of the novel would normally make for a good read: A youth hurt in the civil war matures after rationally evaluating his perceptions of the war. Stephen Crane, however, has taken this idea and gives the impression that he has somehow infused an unwieldy verbosity to the main character, and the book drags unnecessarily."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"I think that this book is horrible because it is extremely boring and most of the time you have no idea what anyone is doing. I think that the people that enjoyed this book are also the people that voted for Clinton. So my advice to you, don't read this book."
1,This book is horrible,"This book is horrible. The soldiers hardly do anything.I enjoy reading about the Civil War, but surely not in this book. I think the writers who raved about this book had to be drunk when they wrote those positive reviews. This book doesn't even deserve a half-star, but one star is the lowest you could go on this site. If you are looking for an EXCELLENT war story, read Walter Dean Myer's ""Fallen Angels."" Now that's a five star war book."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read--EVER,"I had to read this for a book anaylsis for English this year. It was really and truly one of the worst books I've ever read. It would take me forever to describe just how awful it is, but these are the main problems:(1) There is ABOSLUTELY NO PLOT WHATSOEVER.(2) The little dialouge that there is, well, it's mostly swearing--not to mention the fact that I can imagine what a farm boy from the 1860s sounded like without having his accent spelled out for me.(3) The main character (who is never addressed by his name unless someone's talking to him, he's always just ""the youth"") is a wimp and a coward! Okay, I can see how war would be terrifying, yes, I can't understand that--but, my gosh! He's such a wuss that it's almost sickening.(4) The book is altogether badly written. The sentences are awkward, and I kept getting lost. It's hard to tell when one battle ends and another starts.Unless you absolutely have to read this book--DON'T."
4,War is Hell,"* ""Stephen Crane wrote a book depicting war that still holds up, even though it was written many decades ago. Crane shows how young boys can look at the soldier from home and see a hero to be imitated. He then puts his main character, a boy, in the center of the war by making him enlist. Crane's description of war is so clear and accurate. First of all, war kills people in groups. War leaves many more soldiers with loses. Loses of limbs, organs, and mental health. Every time I hear a young person in the subway discuss enlisting into the military, I wonder if he has read Red Badge of Courage."""
4,The Red Badge of Courage,This was a good book but i couldnt tell if he was on the Union or the Confederacy. The book gave hints that he was on the Confederacy like how he would be needed on the farm.It also gave hints that he was on the Union like how the brittle blue line had withstood the attacks.
1,Needs less work...,"This book was long, boring, repetative and hard to understand. It would have been a lot more enjoyable had the author written in clear, short, concise sentences more rather than have a 4 page description after every word."
2,book report for english,"I think this book, even though was very detailed, was not a interesting book. The stry line did not grab my attention, every once in a while my mind would wonder off and i could not concentrate.I also did not like the way the writer made the people have a southern accent. Somtimes you could not tell what the writter was trying to say.I do think the writter was able to describe the people very well even though he did not give them names.I would recomend this book to people between the ages of 15 and 40 because of the safisticated vocabulary in his writting. I would also recomend theis book to people that are interested in historical- fiction"
5,Wow,Stephen Cranes book is an incredible timeless classic. As a young boy I read i for a school project and at first it seemed boring and hard to pay attention to. But afterwards I forgot to return it and I continued to reread it or three months. Gradually I began to undrestand how epic and extraodinary this book is. There are incredible reflections and thoughts hidden behind a war story of a young boy. You just have to be able to understand them.
4,The red badge of courage,I really liked this book and enjoyed how it seemed to put yourself into the story. It wasn't so long as to bog me down and kept me interested the entire journey
4,Nice story of the civil war.,"Great insight into young men volunteering for glory at war. Writing is very simple, almost for young adults but easy read."
3,Just Okay,"I'm not, personally, a fan of war novels however my son read this as required reading in his 5th grade lit class and gave it about a 6 on a scale of 1-10. You might enjoy it."
3,I have to read this one again,"The Red Badge of Courage is a book I have mixed feelings about...maybe part of the problem is that it was required for a Civil War class, and I never enjoy required readings as much.One thing I didn't like was that Crane kept referring to characters like Henry as ""the boy"" or Jim as ""the tall soldier""...that got kind of old. I think the book lost some of its effectiveness because I've seen so many war movies...but these are, of course, based on Crane's book.I wasn't aware of the symbolic nature of the novel when I read it...I'll have to go back now that I know the basic plot and see if I can dig in any deeper."
3,red badge of courage,A very good book about the horrors of war and the fear that soldiers must face. A very good book without being too wordy.
4,good book,"this book is about the civil war, i would recomend it to someone who is looking for a nice short novle about the interamerican war.--Henry Fleming had no idea how horrible war really was. attacks come from all sides, bullets fly,bombs crash. men everywhere are wounded, bleeding, and dying. now , Henry's fighting for his life and he is scared.-- that was one paragraph from the summary on the back of the book."
1,I hated it.,"This Book was not only the worst book ever written, its also the most boring book anyone could've written. Although i have read this book 5+ times, it has never been on my own free will."
1,Red Review,My name is Genny and I am in the 8th grade. I just read the Red Badge of Courage by Stephan Crane and I thought it was bad becuase it was a very slow. boring. and repetitive book. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a boy named Henry and his thoughts and feelings as he went through different battles and challanges of war. In this book I enjoyed the part when it ended and in whch Henry met the 3 men his regiment captured from the Confederates. If I could change anything in this story it would be the ending I thought it was bad and just left the story unfinished. It was almost like Stephan Crane wanted to finish it as quickly as possible and took the first chance he got. I do recommend this book to people over 50 years of age and people who can't take to much of anything at one time. But I do not reccomend this book to any one who is younger than 50 and likes some action and a book that keeps you reading.
1,"I would have given it a ""0"", but it wouldn't let me.","This is a hideously boring book. It drags on with dull language, which can easily put one in a trance. It talks incessantly about needless things and fails to focus on important imagery.The book refers to characters as ""the youth"", ""the thin soldier"", and ""the loud soldier"". It is hard to keep track of the characters.The lack of intriguing language makes it difficult to focus on the redeeming qualities of the book. I, myself, only noticed one: it accurately portrayed a civil war battle."
4,The Red Badge of Courage,"THE RED BADGE OF COURAGEIf you like historical fiction, boy is this is the book for you. If you like the civil war, this is the book for you. The red badge of courage is about a boy, Henry Fleming, is desperate to be a soldier in the civil war. Little does Henry realize what danger the war is.When he joins all of the soldiers are killed, Henry sees that he has to must make a decision. Either he runs away or he saves the other men. So will Henry be a coward and run away or be brave, risk the fact he may die, and be a war hero, is the question.It was a great story showing how hard it was to be a soldier and great description of the war. Sometimes, though, the author made it hard for you to understand but for me you just have to read carefully. Hope you enjoy the book because on a scale of 1-5 I gave it a 4."
3,Great book,"I read this book once before, in school, but never finished. Language could have been a little cleaner, but enjoyed reading it."
4,Red Badge Over-rated,"Re-read after 50 plus years. An American classic, but I think over-rated. Pfrotagagonist seemed pretty literate and introspective for a farm boy."
3,Red Badge of Courage,Love the book but the cover wasn't the one I ordered. I think my grandson would have been more anxious to start reading it with the cover that was pictured.
2,Henry Fleming is a PAINFUL character,"I can't help it. The symbolism is wonderful, the metaphors add beautifully to the story, and even the physical descriptions are well written. But I don't LIKE Henry Fleming! He's painfully adolescent, cowardly, ungrateful, and pathetic. And then at the end he triumphs! Its the triumphs of the Henry Flemings of the world that really drive me crazy. If I had been there I'd have whacked him over the head with my gun, too."
2,Reading with Tequila,"The Red Badge of Courage is considered a classic piece of American literature about a boys experience in the Civil War. I knew it was a book about war going in and I tried to enjoy it anyway. I couldn't, but not because it was about war. The dialogue was an atrocious mess of apostrophes, It was so bad that I could only barely decipher what was being said in some passages. The storyline itself seemed mildly interesting and it is quite possible the book is very good in a literary sense. Unfortunately for me, the speaking style was barely tolerable and I found it very hard to stay involved in what was going on."
2,What a bore,This book had so much detail that it is practically impossible to pay attention too. I was constantly getting lost and had no idea what was going on. I had to force myself to finish this book. I feel it would have been a better book if the author would have used more simple words instead of his countless in depth descriptions of every possible thing...
1,UGH!!! HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW!,i'm sorry for all the people that like this book. I had to read it during the summer and I read like 4 pages a day 1. because i had to stop and think about what happened 2. because i just hate the book! I don't see why teachers make children read it. it reads like it is for adults who understand books word for word. It's so hard to follow! i'm done! don't buy it!
1,awful,i had to read this in high school. it was the only book that year that i truly hated. it's boring and it glorifies war.
1,Too Bad You Can't Give Something Zero Stars!,"Oh my gosh. Talk about a PAINFUL read! This was assigned reading for the summer before my freshman year of high school. It was painfully boring. It has no plot for a long time, the dialects are hard to read and understand, and the main character is the biggest wimp! I got through about half the book, then I stopped because I was so fed up with it. I only found out how it ended when we went over what we needed to know about the book for a test on it. Now, some people might argue that it's a classic. Well, some classics just need to be put out of their misery! Throughout the book I would find myself zoning out. I would then have to backtrack and reread usually about three chapters. If you are a history teacher, please, please, PLEASE spare your students a lot of pain and severe boredom and DO NOT assign this book! I know there are better historical fiction novels out there. Or better yet, make them read non-fiction. At least then its true and realistic!"
1,I would give it a NEGATIVE review if I could!,"This is without a doubt the most single boring piece of utter nonsense ever published. It was HORRIBLE! This ""writer"" could spend 5 pages describing the veins of a leaf; and manage to make it more boring than it already is. He is boring, boring, boring, the only thing this book is good for is starting a fire in your fireplace. UGH!"
2,Not great,"This book has loads of potential, but it really did not capture the real feeling.What i found especially disapointing was that the main charachter just shoots a shot or two, cusses, shoots again, walks through the woods, sits down, thinks, sees some dead people,etc... Maybe I a exaggerating a bit, but thats how i felt. Not a great read with the small children book, but some good refrence material is present.Hope this is helpful"
2,"Humourous, but extrodinary boring.","A book about a recruit called Henry, also referred as 'the youth' enlisted into the army during the stretch of time, known as the Civil War. He meets friends, called Jim, William; known better as the Tall guy, or Loud Mouth Guy. He runs away from his first battle, and return with a change of heart. A new braver heart, with this new courage, he fights like a wild cat with his friends. With this new heart he can face anything that might ever behold him.In my opinion, Henry should be more referred as Henry, not 'the youth' and his comrades with their proper names, instead of the Loud one, or the Tall one. The story, doesn't catch the reader within its net. It makes a reader, like me unable to concentrate of the settings."
2,Red Badge of what?,I REALLY DON'T LIKE THS BOOK. I HAD TO READ IT FOR MY 8TH GRADE ENGLISH CLAS AND..... UGH I HATED IT. CRANE IS A GOOD WRITER BUT.... THIS BOOK GOES ON AND ON AND IT GETS TO BE BORING!
2,This book should be entitled The Red Badge of Boredom.,"That's what my classmates and I referred to it as while we were reading it in my eleventh grade English class. While I understand that the novel is complex in certain ways, it is very monotonous, and it drags. It is definitely one of those books that made me smile...because it was over."
4,Excellent novel,"I read this book only recently. Many people could be lost in the simplistic setting and plot but if you look deeper you realize the true complexity of the novel.Crane uses this novel to ironically view the art of war. His vivid imagery and the actions of young Henry Fleming provide you with the progression of a soldier from an innocent to a seasoned warrior.Crane uses this book to make us view civilization as we know it. Are we really civilized? If so, why haven't we stopped practicing the primitive art known as war?"
3,This book was very realistic.....,"I thought this book was a very realistic view of war. Crane's sense of naturalism really comes through in his portrayal of Henry Fleming. Henry must go through the trials and tribulations of war, just like any other soldier. This book shows how Henry must mature from the glory seeking soldier to the life-seeking soldier."
4,The Red Badge of Courage,"The Red Badge of Courage is about a boy named Henry who goes off to fight in the Civil War. Henry finds himself waiting for what seems like an eternity, for his first battle. When the battle begins Henry runs away. While trying to regroup with his regiment he witnesses the horrific death of one of his friends. Henry steps up in battle and is hit on the head. He gives his comrades the illusion that he was shot. In a later battle Henry has to be held down, to keep from firing. In the next battle Henry witnesses the Color Guard die. Henry picks up the and assumes the role of Color Guard. I like this book because it gave very discriptive details. Crane also did a good job on describing Henry's feelings and troubles. Crane paints a very vivid image of war in my mind."
2,The Country Christmas Collection,"A list of song titles would be a helpful tool so you know what songs are on the cd,I am looking for Old Toy Trains by Roger Miller and with out a list of songs how do you know to buy it? If anyone knows if the song on this album is Toy Trains please let me know."
5,Wonderful Teaching!,"This is a great series! We buy these for our 4 year old daughter who within a day or so will be singing the songs and quoting the verses, even more amazing is she understands the basic concept of the verses as well!"
5,non stick roaster,"my daughter in law is very happy with it, and looks forward to cooking the Christmas turkey. I do not have any personal experience of this item."
2,Different from what I expected,I have expected a better quality from Calphalon products but this one is really not up to par. The rack and the container just don't seem match one another (size wise). The lifters are ok but you see solder marks and the metal is not well polished. The injector is scary... outside it looks normal but inside of the injector was filled with dark brown/black grease/oil. I tried to clean it but it's almost impossible. I end up throw away the injector and the lifters and only kept the rack and the container. I have seen better quality with cheaper price products. This one just doesn't worth it.
5,Great bang for your buck!,"This item was a great value after free shipping and promotional discounts. I am no gourmet chef, but this worked quite well with my stuffed chicken."
5,"Calphalon Roaster with Rack, Baster, Injector and Lifters",I am very pleased with this roaster. It is everything I thought it would be. I am so glad that Amazon had this for sale. I certainly recommend this to anyone who appreciates good cookware.
3,Inside Story on Teen Girls,"Good book....I like the way it's set up with the girl's section on one side and the parent's on the other. Much of it is common sense, but I most appreciated reading it from the kids' point of view."
2,Something important missing,"The sections on sexuality discuss only heterosexuality--""boyfriends and girlfriends."" There is only one question that I found acknowledging or asking about homosexuality in the book, and that is not even in relation to the question-asker herself or in the context of the relationship discussion. Having been a lesbian teenager, I feel this is a great disservice to all teenagers questioning/developing their sexuality. It is one-sided and takes only the heterosexual teenager under consideration and assumes that every teenaged girl feels the same about boys. The authors and the American Psychological Association should have done better than this."
3,"A good, if uninspired outing","Posessing one of the most unique guitar sounds, one I have loved since I first heard his work with Chrome, Creed continues to release good sounding discs. Sadly, he is revealing his limitations as a writer, most of his recent works have sounded like rehashes of earlier stuff, making most of his output pretty interchangable. If you own one or two of his releases you are set, unless you are a completist. By all means, check his stuff out folks, just don't expect a lot of variation or growth between releases."
1,Birthday gift,contains only 6 or 7 small packs of candy or cookies....no where near worth the cost. would never do it again.
5,Wonderful Patricia A,I thought this was a spectacular book. I loved how each person a different view of what happened. Each person had different feelings and i like how they portrayed it in the book. Stuyvesant High School had to face tough times after the September 11th tragedy. I am amazed how they can write a book 2 years after the catastrophe. I applaud them for a job well done!
3,With Their Eyes-9-11,"WITH THEIR EYES edited by ANNIE THOMAS was a good book about September 11th. Some of the author were students, teachers,and people who work at Stuyvesant High School,two blocks away from the Twin Towers.Some of the reaction were sadness, crazy with fear,and some student were not beleiveing it was happening to the TWIN TOWERS. If you want to know the rest of the book, you have to read the book."
2,Wasted time.,"I read this before attending my freshman year at college for fashion design because I had previously had almost no experience sewing. I can't say it helped much. Certainly, I became reasonably decent at sewing once my classes started, but I don't attribute any of my limited skill to this book. The best thing you can do for yourself is sit at a sewing machine with someone who has experience. Some of the information in this book is useful *after* you've learned the basics on a machine, but much of it is information useless to a person with no actual experience. Don't waste your time or money on this book, find a friend or family member that can give you an hour of their time and you will be much better off."
5,Great little book for most sewing,"I hadn't sewn for many years. I bought this book, hoping it would guide me and IT DID!!Very comprehensive, lots of tips and solid information and pretty easy to follow. I recommend it."
4,Sewing for Dummies,"Good book, covers most of what I wanted. Also bought ""Teach Yourself Visually Sewing (Teach Yourself Visually)"""
3,Not for beginners,"If you are a true beginner, this book lacks sufficient pictures and diagrams. Written instructions are pretty good. This book runs the gamut from home decor, craft projects, and any type of clothing you'd ever want to wear."
3,it's okay,"This book is just okay really. I knew absolutely nothing about sewing when I got this book. I wanted to start sewing clothing to sell, so I thought this would be a good place to start. It's not something you can sit down and just read at all. There's ALOT of information just sort of thrown together. It seems less like a how-to book and more like someone who knows alot about the subject just babbling at you. Honestly, I'd suggest 101 Essential Tips Basic Sewing. It gives you good basic advice in a quick simple manner. It's alot easier to follow. You dont have to skip from this section to this section to see what they're talking about, AND it's ALOT cheaper."
2,This book didn't work for me.,"I've been teaching myself to sew the last few months and in that time I've checked out all the books my library has to offer on the subject. Since I really like all the other ""for Dummies"" books that I have read I decided to buy this one sight-unseen to keep around the house as my reference. It's not a bad book but there are better books out there for those of us who are new to sewing or need a refresher in basics. If the book were organized differently I think I might like it more. Compared to other books of this type the information is not as well organized or easy to find. The illustrations are nice but again I've seen others that work better for me. I wouldn't say not to buy this book, but check it out first and make sure it's teaching (or refreshing what you already know) in a way that is useful to you. This book was not useful to me."
3,Not enough for this dummy,"I am a big fan of the For Dummies series. When I want to learn a new programming language, that's the first place I always start. But perhaps the editors of the series feel more comfortable programming than sewing because this book isn't nearly enough. A true dummy to arts, crafts, and sewing, I needed many more diagrams, more information on fabric, more on what all the info. means at the end of a bolt of fabric, more definitions. Just more! The style is the same dummies friendliness, but I'll have to take some very basic classes on what I had hoped Sewing for Dummies would offer. After that, it might be a great book."
1,So Confusing!!!,"I got this book hoping that it would help me learn the basics of sewing. I've gotten ""For Dummies"" books in the past and have had great success with them; however, this particular one is confusing, non-discriptive, and the pictures are vague. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. This book gives a brief overview of various topics, but never explains anything...the patterns that you use to sew with are more helpful. I just use YouTube now to figure out how to sew what I need to do."
2,Not all I was hoping for...,"After careful review of many different books, I chose this one. While it has a lot of information, I was specifically looking for a book on how to alter/""fit"" clothing that is too big or small. I have very little sewing experience, so from a sewing basics standpoint, this book is a good choice, as it will give you a little (I stress the word little) information on many different sewing topics.I felt the book could've had better illustrations and the author's duplicate instructions for those using a serger were a little annoying. I mean if you are reading a Sewing for Dummies book, what are the chances you are using a serger?!I would suggest if you have a certain aspect of sewing you are wanting to learn about, try to find a book that is specific to that subject."
2,Boring!,This book has a lot fo information but it's so hard to read. Very mundane. Sewing should be exciting and fun. This book was cheap which is why I bought it but other books are better like the reader's digest sewing book.
2,Too old-fashioned,The types of projects and instructions in here seem geared to a woman int he 60's trying to sew. I don't think I learned one piece of useful information from the book...
4,Great for beginners and professionals,"Some parts get a little confusing, with a few step by steps that don't add up. But, the techniques described in this book will make anyone a better sewer. And, there are great simple project ideas throughout the book for beginners that allow you to practice as you read through the book. I highly enjoy this book."
2,There are better alternatives for a beginner,"I bought this andSew Everything Workshopto try out my new sewing machine (I had absolutely no previous experience or anyone to teach me) and I have used the other book 99% of times. I have hardly used this one at all.I regret buying it, it's too much text very few exciting projects, and honestly, pretty boring.The other book explains things as thoroughly but in a much more fun way."
4,From dumber than dumb!,"I have read small parts of this book since I picked it up. Some parts are very easy to follow, and very helpful to this beginner. It covers many different topics, which helps me think about different projects I could tackle. But some parts still need more explanation for me to understand -- drawings or breaking down the steps even more would be helpful."
4,great help to start sewing,"Bought this to help my daughter start sewing and she LOVES it a lot. It has helped in the ""dumb"" basic questions she had starting up sewing. I recommend it."
3,"Well, it wasn't as helpful as I had hoped.","This book still provides the basics, some terminology and such...but the patterns that are ""included"" are outdated by about 20 years. That was very disappointing since the instructions refer to these patterns and that feature was a big selling point for me, so as to practice the actual tips and learn with the book before spending more money at the fabric store!"
2,far too complicated for dummies.,there is too much needless information in here about things that aren't really sewing as much as crafts and edging.
4,Lots of helpful hints,"I decided to get this book in order to stop being embarrassed about my lack of sewing skills. I didn't even know how to put on a button! This book has been great for teaching me those kinds of simple things like buttons and hemming. It has info on bigger projects as well, which I haven't tackled yet."
3,Mixed Bag,"I hadn't sewn since my jr high home ec class almost 2 decades ago, so when I bought a sewing machine I needed a good intro to sewing book. I purchased this one and also theThe Complete Photo Guide to Sewing (Singer). I'm glad that I got both since their strengths and weaknesses complement each other.Pros of the ""Dummies"" book: assumes no prior knowledge, tone is very reassuring, sticks to the basics and doesn't overwhelm the reader with information, written directions are clear and easy to follow.Cons: lack of step-by-step illustrations, missing some useful information such as how to adjust a pattern before cutting the fabric."
4,good case,"sturdy case, looks slick and is very functional. I use it with a casi exilim 10Mpx and if fits pretty tight vertically and has extra space horizontaly as it was not designed specifically for that camera, but is thebest case I have seen so far... easy to carry with you. It does have, however a metallic plate for the manufacturers logo and includes a couple ribbets kinda sticking inside (covered with fuzzy fabric), so Im just very carefulll to not let my delicate screen touch that side of the case and turn it back to it."
4,Holo.,"I just love it. I bought this specific CD because there was one song exclusive to it. (""We Don't Sleep At Night."") It's also odd to me hearing the older version of Romantic Rights- so different."
2,Not happy,"I liked this product until I tried to get it on my 2GB ipod and it would not fit. I struggled to get in on, succeeding in only making it part way, and then really struggled to get it back off. I do not recommend it. I do like the clip and since I had some silicone covers it will fit with those."
1,Obvious garbage,Have you noticed that the only other review given for this book is by its author? Need I say more?
1,Bad purchase,"The printer was inoperable when I received it. After looking ""under the hood"" I discovered that the drive belt for the printer head was off it's rollers and twisted around the printer head. There were no cables included. Clearly the seller was hoping to unload a defective printer. In order to get a refund, I had to ship it back to the seller at my own expense. And because it was selling for $100, I had to insure it. Thus I was out a little over $20 on this purchase."
1,useless,"My version of this printer was pretty much useless because everytime I went to print, the paper would get jammed. This happened over and over and over and over and over again. I was not doing anything fancy, simply printing black/white documents. This is why I rank this product as utterly useless. Canon should devote some serious attention to their paper feeding system on this printer."
5,"I'm a Bug, so are you Baby.","Punk the way nature intended. And it goes like this, ""Johnny got his gun and ack ack ack ack""."
2,Nail color,I was disappointed with this product because the actual color is very different from what the computer shows.
2,More about the author than ADD.,"I was diagnosed with ADD relatively late--age 50. Since then I've read both this book and Hallowell's ""Delivered from Distraction."" While I found Mate's personal story to be quite compelling, there is little more found in this book outside of a lot of conjecture. Hallowell, on the other hand, packed his book with the latest science, which was incredibly helpful to my understanding of my special brain, how to live with it and manage it."
2,News Flash....It's the Mother's Fault,This book spends a lot of time hypothesizing on what causes ADD. Dr. Mate proposes it comes from insecure attachment and maternal unhappiness in infancy. This did not ring true for me and I found his strong attachment to his theory so off-putting that I couldn't get to anything good the book might offer. Anyone who is dealing with ADD knows how frustrating it is and how confusing all the information can be. My advice is skip this book.
3,"Interesting Thesis, But Not Helpful","Dr. Mate provides an interesting thesis, but it just doesn't ring true. We have counseled thousands of children with ADHD, including hundreds which came from stable, two-parent homes where the parents were very in tune with their child.Parents don't need this guilt trip. What they do need are practical solutions and steps to cultivate their child's natural gifts, talents and passions. This is what breeds confidence.We use Kirk Martin' Celebrate!ADHD paradigm in our practice, and it has worked wonderfully for both parents and children. Kirk Martin has been called the ""ADHD Super Nanny"" and we'd recommend his E-Courses and Book, ""Celebrate!ADHD"" before you read ""Scattered."" You can find free tips and a newsletter at the celebrateADHD website.It's difficult to endorse Dr. Mate's work when his underlying premise has so many flaws."
1,Great for laying on Parent Guilt,"I have an ADHD child and I have always wondered WHY? Is it genetic since he does have at least an Uncle, an Aunt, two cousins and a Father with ADD or ADHD? Oh no it's not geenetic! but now I have the answer from Gabor Mate!!It is due to MY poor parenting skills! It is due to not providing a stable, loving home for this emotionally wounded child. Furthermore, if I only would satisfy this child's need for attention, his need for love and affection then everything would be OK AND his ADHD would very nicely disappear. Of course, Mate does not back up his opinions with facts other than his own childhood stories. No, I don't buy it, and I will not keep this ADHD book on my shelf.If you want a great book on how to help you work with, and parent an ADHD child read Barkley's Taking Charge of ADHD book."
3,Lost Focus,"I'd have to agree with several of the other reviewers.The book is good. Is has many funny and true to life scenes.It has much practical advice.But.The theory of early childhood arrested development (though itmay have truth in it) did not have enough backing. I wantedmore proof more studies. As it is it's just another theory.Also the promised ""What you can do about it"" seemed lacking.There was some there, but it seemed more oriented (at leastin the adult perspective) to handling and dealing with theproblem (all the info was useful and OK), but nothing aboutreversing the theorized brain problems (which I was expecting).Also the book seemed to get long winded at times. I foundmyself skimming the last half of several chapters after Ihad read the same thing said a different way for the fourthtime.BUTDon't get me wrong. I like the book. If you are voraciouslyreading through the ADHD literature (as I seem to be at themoment) then this is a worthwhile read."
5,The Real Deal,"The ""medical"" and ""pharmaceutical"" approaches that dominate the discussion of many psychological issues, including ADHD, can't hold a candle to the clarity and depth of Mate's analysis. Being a doctor himself, he self-administered the drugs typically prescribed for ADHD, (with which he was diagnosed as an adult), only to find it made him a more efficient workaholic. The insights he had as he wrestled with the deeper issues involved in the management of his own ADHD and those of others, make this book the BEST I've across on the subject. While admitting that drugs can certainly be helpful, he makes a compelling case for becoming more mindful of one's behaviors in getting a handle on ADHD. Furthermore, the book is so well written that it makes for highly entertaining reading, providing a more comprehensive understanding of ADHD as a social and cultural phenomenon rather than a medical or genetic problem.Can't recommend it enough."
5,Unbelievably helpful and insightful,"As a mother searching for resources and help for my ADD son, I found this book incredibly helpful. It touched on so much more than just the ADHD label and taught me more about how my son perceives the world around him. The book hit the nail on the head for me and showed me how, as a parent, I have so much more involvement in the healing process (and hindering process!) than what I was initially taught by some of the doctors and counselors. The best part about this book is it tells exactly what to do to help you and your child manage and improve parent/child temperaments. Wonderful book and resource!"
4,Solid album,"This band deserved better.They were ruined by bad press(unfairly)and grunge.The press labeled them as Led Zeppelin ripoffs and the public bought into it.The third album ""Hands of Time"" may not be as tight as the first two releases,but is very good overall.If you're a KC fan at all,the first three albums are must owns."
2,Cooks well but poorly balanced.,"I bought this pan to replace a covered 10"" pan. Out of the box I noticed that the lid felt heavier than the pan. Although the pan cooked food well, the handle is uncomfortably long and not well balanced to the pan. Once you add food it's even harder to manage. It may have been helpful if this pan had a 'helper handle' but I'm not even sure that would solve the problem. I am going to return it and hope to find something better."
4,Love this pan,"I have had this pan for acouple of years.I love this pan.It cleans up in a snap.It cooks even.It sits even on my gas stove.It can go in the oven, after searing your foods.It will last forever.I do like the handle better then all my Calphalon commerical handles.This handle is shorter and fatter. I have thin hands/fingers, and I can grip this one easier.This would have been better if it had the helper handle, but its suppose to be a egg pan, all though I have used it for just about anything.I do think the lid is very heavy!I bought this pan on Amazon for about $30.00, and also bought another one for a gift when I was in BB&B;, for alittle more money.Amazon , there was no shipping, or tax fees. I love it ..The pan CANNOT go into the dishwasher, but the lid can, although I hand wash mine.I would buy this again, but not for almost the $100.00 that the price is here, plus the shipping cost!!!!!"
1,"Oh, Hammerhead where art thou?","Into the Vortex is the best cd by this band hands down. When I first heard it back in the 90's I was blown away. I guess this is an ""experimental"" album, which usually means that its gonna stink. Most of the songs are un-listenable. There are maybe one or two keepers at most, and they pale in comparison to ""Into the Vortex."" Just buy that other cd or check out the singer's newer band VAZ, which is a lot better ""Duh, the big city."""
2,Kindle?,I would like this book to be available for the Kindle Fire. When will you guys have this ready for the Kindle Fire so I can download the book instead of ordering it and waiting for it to come in the mail?
5,THE PINNACLE OF A GREAT SCIENCE FICTION EPIC,This is the best of the Lensman series and I have read it so many times for pure enjoyment and imagination that I can almost recite it from memory. It is an absolute must for readers who like to speculate on the evolution of mental powers.
5,The climax to my favorite sci-fi series of all time!,"The salvation of the galaxy is at hand! The eons old plan of the Arisian's is coming to fruition at last. You don't see science fiction novels penned with this type of unabashed romantic writing style any more! As you can tell by my e-mail address, I'm a big-time ""Lensmen"" series fan."
5,A boost of courage,"As a newly sinlge woman with two small children, this book was exactly what I needed. It gave me a boost of courage and made me think that it is possible to have a good life and raise happy children as a single woman. I like Judy Ford's spunk and her own stories about her struggles to be a satisfied single. I think she is a role model of courage.A couple parts made me laugh out loud."
4,surprising,"I had an open mind about this book. The first half of it didn't really pertain to myself at all. But about half way though there cane a few stories and analysis that hit close to home. I actually wanted to rip out a few pages and hand them to my family and and say ""See! This is how it really is"". But i contained myself and bookmarked it for future references :) It's not a book that I can just sit down and read all the way though, rather more like leave it sitting out and i'll read it when I'm in the mood."
4,Uplifting,"I decided to read this book after a devastating breakup. It has really lifted my spirits and left me feeling optimistic about my future as a single woman. I like the ""try this"" suggestions at the end of each section."
5,Great book,"Read this book years ago beginning of college years, find myself reading it again and still love it! Inspirational, helpful, easy read"
5,Both sides of the single coin,"This is an honest, heartfelt look at both sides of the single coin and that is why I like it so much. On one side of the coin, I really like the single life that I've created for myself and on the other side I feel lonely in what often seems like a world of couples. After reading this book, I felt good about the life I am living.I liked the tips and quotes. Thank you Ms. Ford for givng singles dignity."
2,Being Single Isn't Fatal,"Judy Ford reminds us that being single doesn't mean you are a loser, that it's not a fatal condition, that loneliness isn't tragic or bad, and that going to dinner alone means you are hungry not that you're a reject. Dozens of platitudes form the essence of this book. Platitudes aren't bad things. Perhaps on a bad night when your bed is big and lonely, they will help you get through the night."
4,Enjoyable,"I teach a preschool class with 3-5 year olds. After reading ""Leaf Man"" we went on a nature walk and looked for ""Leaf Man"" and gathered leaves together. Later we used those leaves and others that I had already gathered and tried making our own ""Leaf Man"" using contact paper. The kids thoroughly enjoyed ""Leaf Man"" and ask me to read it often."
4,great book,This is a great book for children to explore their imagination. I love to use it every fall with my students.
3,Nice Fall Book,"Seems like it would be a nice fall book. As a general rule we like this authors books (eating the alphabet was our favorite) as she does have wonderful artwork. As other reviewers had stated, using the book then finding your own ""leaf man"" in the yard would be a lot of fun. On its own, this book was a little challenging for our toddler. The pictures shown are a little more advanced and require concentration to find the birds, trees and other things the leaf man saw as he blew by. By next fall we will probably give this book a try again.... from the library!"
3,"It's Nice but... a review of Lois Ehlert's ""Leaf Man""","Wow, lots of people apparently like this book, but I can only judge by the reactions of my children to the book, and they didn't really like it that much. Certainly not as much as some of Ms. Ehlert's other works like ""Snowballs"" and ""Growing Vegetable Soup"".I think the principal reason they didn't go bonkers over ""Leaf Man"" is that there really wasn't much of story. Leaf Man (or Leaf Guy as we call him) blew around a lot, but it wasn't as if he had any opinion about the process or that there was any drama.Three Stars. The artwork was good and, as always, very creative-- the source of much discussion and our own art project-- but when you get down to it, Leaf Man just blew around. Worth checking out at the library."
4,Leaves All Around Me,"Leaf Man had great illustrations in it. Each page was covered with colorful leaves all over the place. Throughout the story, Ehlert mentions different animals, and on the page is that animal made out of leaves. If reading this to a young child, they would love seeing how the leaves form into animals. The story is very cute as well. I think this would be best for pre-k."
4,facial steamer,"This is a good product for the money. There are some features I would like to mention though. I received No manual for the appliance at all. Also, its difficult figuring out exactly how much water you should add to the glass container. It seems like you have to fill it ALL the way, and the steamer will cut off when it reaches about half way or less."
4,Good quality,"Wasn't sure what to expect, 1st time I've ordered CD's through internet.I received item QUICKLY, few days after my order. The quality is very good, new condition actually. I will order this way again."
1,Jeep Wrangler NOT what I expected!,I was not happy at all with the Jeep Wrangler pet stroller. I purchased the stroller for my senior dachshund. The front wheels wobble horribly causing the entire stroller to shake. I expected a high quality durable product with the name Jeep Wrangler associated with it. I was very disappointed and will be returning the item.
4,Great Book,"This book it pretty tough to get through for chemical engineers because you likely don't have any prior experience. However the material covers everything you need to know for your major. After this you pretty much know what you're going to get in future chemical engineering classes. Its also a pretty well written book, a bit thick so you might have to read it over a few times. It may not seem like it at the time but this is one of the most helpful chem. engineering books you'll ever use. We used it in our introductory chemical engineering class at UC Berkeley."
1,not what I bought,"It says that it is the 7th edition but they send the 6th edition. I had to return it because I needed the seventh for a college course.The sixth is way so far different. Not to mention that it was supposed to be the USA hardcover 7th edition but it was the International Softcover 6th Edition. What they really are selling is the soft cover international edition but there's no previous advice of that fact.So, I had it returned and bought the right one in another site."
1,Very Frustrating,"I ordered this scanner to replace an old one which was on it's last leg. I regret to say that the Microtek ScanMaker X12USL is easily the most difficult piece of hardware I've ever used. It took a long time to set up, then every time I tried to use it, it always gave me trouble. I must admit that I'm not the most computer literate person around, so I hired a computer guy to help. It took him an hour and a half to get things working. He was as baffled as I was. After he left, the scanner started acting up again. Since I had already thrown away the box and the packaging materials, I donated the scanner to the local high school. Hopefully they'll be able to figure it out.Note: I bought an Epson Perfection 1200U scanner next, and have not had any problems with it. It seems to work pretty good so far."
1,Unreliable & poor service,"During the first three months of operation, the scanner failed intermittently and then failed completely during the fourth month (just after receiving the rebate check).Then I found out about the lack of a toll free technical support number. Although they have a general toll free number, you are referred to a toll number if it requires any diagnosis. When I finally contacted the RMA department via e-mail (this took 3 business days), I was informed that if they found nothing wrong, it would cost me, and (more money) (whether anything was wrong or not) if they couldn't ship it back using the box I sent it in. They also informed me it would take 5 - 10 business days for them to fix it once they receive it. All the time they made me feel they were doing me a favor. I would avoid both this particular product and the vendor. The software provided did not make using the scanner easy. I'm not looking forward to getting the scanner back."
2,Microtek ScanMaker,"I was excited when I first bought it. That soon faded. It was easy to install and scan images in. The part that made me pull my hair out was the editing, and file selections. Half the time it would not want to go into the file I wanted it to. I had trouble cropping and adding special details. The images it did scan in were not that great. Some were a little blurred. Overall, I would not reccomend this product."
4,The Definitive Discography For Slowhand-philies,"An exhastive listing of possibly every session Eric Clapton has sat in as band member, frontman, or sideman. From the songs recorded to the instruments used, almost anything you wanted to know about Clapton's recorded legacy can be found here, including mention of some of the better bootlegs. The only shortfalling - guitars used is listed, but amplifcation is not. A must for any serious Eric Clapton fanatic."
3,This book needs footnotes!,"An integral part to any Shakespeare work is the presence of footnotes! This book has a glossary, but it does not do any good because there is not sign in the actual text itself that one can look up specific words in the glossary. While the plays themselves are very enjoyable, do not purchase this edition unless you feel very confident about your ability to read Shakespearean language."
4,for shakespeare fans,"this is a great book for shakespeare fans. it was the first time i read shakespeare outside of class, and it was very interesting. i didn't like the prefaces much, i didn't have the patience to read them. i felt they were very of long, and harder to read and understand than the actual shakespeare. they actual plays-not stories, just to clarify- are wonderful. it would be a great book to read if you are taking a literature class and want to get a head start or if you want to expand your vocabulary. you can even relate the problems of those times to the problems of today. the plays were very fun to read once you got into them; shakespeare is just as great as he is said to be."
4,Nothing is as it seems in Seaside...,"A light, fun summer read. Set in a summer tourist town, a seemingly unrealistic scenario is keeping our star crossed lovers, Blakley and Robert, apart. As the story of their *forbidden* romance unfolds, we learn that the silly scenario is actually anchored in reality...sort of. Surf and Turf is a fun, light, and yes, even happy read, just made for the beach. If you want to smile, Surf and Turf is a good choice."
2,Dangerous advice,"Garfield tell photographers they should never approach a sow with cubs, but says nothing about the danger of approaching a solitary male or female. Is it OK to approach a solitary bear? No. At some point you'll encroach on the bear's personal space and force it to fight or flee. You don't want to provoke a charge from a male grizzly, do you? You don't want to drive a female black bear away from berries, acorns or some other food source, do you? It's dangerous and unethical to approach any bear for a photograph. If Garfield doesn't know this, you can imagine all the other mistakes in this book."
3,Bear vs Man,This book chronicles recent attacks in a straight forward but not very interesting or original way. The stories of the attacks are told second hand as they were told originally. I know this as my husband is one of the featured chapters.
5,CHECK it out,"""Tropical Tales of Terror"" is just simply amazing. From start to finish, it keeps you 'on the edge of your seat' with some great stories & I think one of the best things about this book is that you NEVER know what's going to happen next & it just makes you keep reading. Truthfully it's a GREAT book & Roberto Guzmán does an EXCELENT job on this one. ""Two Thumbs UP"""
4,"One of the finest of Morricone's ""Lost "" Scores...","Though John Boorman's original vision for the sequel may be lost forever, leaving us with the mess today that goes by the title of EXORCIST 2: THE HERETIC, the best thing to come out of the whole experience was one of the most haunting themes composed by Morricone, the last of the old-style film scoring masters. The score is actually much better than the film it was written for, and even helps redeem the film in some ways. (The hilariously over-the-top disco version of ""Pazuzu's Theme"" is forgiveable, considering how bad the film itself is.) For the beauty of the Main Title and ""Suspended Melody,"" though, the purchase of this soundtrack is definitely worth it."
2,Big drawback,"The songs are wonderful, but there is no official CD with this tracklisting. Pirated, most likely. I'd rather people didn't buy it."
4,"Writing about music, not weather or not it was pirated...","Reviews should be written based on the music, not on weather or not it is pirated material. Ahem. Great music composition, orchestra meets a touch of metal with a dash of classical singing. The frontwoman has a remarkably powerful, yet soft voice. Buy it if you like bands such as Nightwish, Leaves eyes, Lacuna Coil, ect. Rock on-"
4,Still Sounding Great,This Dvd is well worth the price. Donovan still is a charismatic entertainer with some great stories to tell. It is refreshing to hear all of these wonderful songs played again. Donovan's guitar has never sounded better and while the years have deepened his voice he still maintains a high level of vocal delivery which all Donovan fans have come to expect.
1,Useless,"I used these every day, two or three times a day for several months TO NO AVAIL. Fortunately I read about olive oil and I found out how wonderful olive oil is for chapped, cracked lips. Olive oil has made such a *dramatic* difference that I no longer buy these sticks."
1,Not For Use in Firm Soil,"I purchased 5 of these and had a major problem. I needed to move the spikes after initially putting them in the ground and, unfortunately, the tops are not strongly attached to the spike so in every case the top pulled off and left the spike in the ground. I had to literally dig the spikes out of the ground. I purchased the Dramm Premium Hose Spikes #13001 from Amazon and, although I have not yet put them in the ground, they appear to be much better made. Unfortunately, they are about twice the price of the Orbit ones."
2,Top comes off,"Indeed the plastic top comes off easily. So either decide where to put them and never move them, or make sure that the soil where you put them is not too firm. Other than that they work well and are fairly unobtrusive, but the flimsy construction is a turn-off in my case."
3,"It's well-built, but flawed","This is an ok device, but the spike isn't long enough to be really useful since most gardens have such soft soil. It needs to be about 6"" or 8"" longer to really hold its footing in most places at my house.I tried to go to the hardware store and buy a 24"" long piece of pipe to slide over the spike to keep it from pulling out of the ground, but since the spike is tapered, nothing would work. So I bought the Suncast equivalent piece, which has a plastic, non-tapered spike and added the extension pipe and it worked just fine, but the Suncast piece isn't as well-made as this one, so I'm still a bit disappointed.This piece would have gotten 5 stars if the spike was 6"" or 8"" longer."
1,Shortened Version,"The dvd speed was too fast. Sounds like ""Ivy and the Chipmunks"". May have been more pleasurable if viewed at a normal speed. Waited two weeks for a big letdown."
1,for love of nonsense,"This artificial trash -- a step below real trash -- is sheer nonsense through and through. The moronic plot, acting, and dialogue have regrettably displaced ""The Return of the Black Stallion"" as the worst waste of thirty minutes of my time. I would have bailed out sooner, but I was reluctant to accept that Sidney Poitier of ""To Sir, With Love"" fame would participate in such an asinine production. ZERO stars!"
5,I love this movie!,Sidney Poitier is one of my favorite actors and he links up nicely with Abby Lincoln. A very cute love story.
4,I really enjoy it!,"I saw this film because I would like to see a very young Jennifer O'Neill. Unfourtanetely she is seen in a very few moments, but I really enjoy the film."
5,FOR LOVE OF IVY,"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. A REAL ""CHICK FLICK"", OR, FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T MIND A GOOD LOVE STORY! I LOVE SYDNEY POITIER AND ABBEY LINCOLN IN THIS FILM. HOWEVER, A MUCH YOUNGER BEAU BRIDGES REMINDS YOU OF WHAT A GREAT ACTOR HE IS, AND CARROLL O'CONNOR -- ALTHOUGH ONLY SEEN IN JUST A FEW SCENES -- FULLY COMMANDS HIS ROLE AS THE FATHER.5 STARS WITHOUT A DOUBT!"
4,LA Cowboy,This was a cool reality show depicting the country lifestyle of cattle ranchers in Montana. I am interested to see where they go with other seasons if they have any.
3,It could have been great,Too much emphasis on dead baby calfs. I would like to have seen more of the personal conflicts - I guess I was hoping for Deadliest Catch Cowboy. Maybe it gets there as we haven't watched all the episodes but had it been great we would have watched them all by now.
