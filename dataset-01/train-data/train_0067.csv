2,"Not a true ""noir"" film","I don't think this film should be labelled as ""film noir"". Its main characters are extremely wealthy Manhattan residents who overdo the ""rich snob"" act. Most of the scenes take place in apartment sets that look more appropriate to an Astaire film. While Gene Tierney is truly beautiful to watch, she fails to convey much of a sense of a femme fatale. When you first see her acting in a Clifton Webb flashback, she is way too ""goody two shoes"" to support a noir film. Speaking of Webb, neither he nor Vincent Price is at all convincing as a man who might successfully compete for a beautiful woman's attention. Frankly, both of them act more like caricatures of gay New Yorkers than as romantic leads. You might as well write a movie script that has Felix Unger as the prime suspect."
2,So Overrated.,"Viewed: 10/12Rate: 310/12: Laura is overrated with the capital letters of OhiO. The film is done with very little intelligence, and the characters are thoroughly obnoxious and mostly jackasses. After fifteen minutes, I was watching the time. Ten minutes later, I was thinking of what to do the next day to run my errands. Five minutes later, I fell asleep. No way that the stupid detective (what an idiot he was in trying to solve the mystery and for letting Laura to be unprotected and revealed afterwards) will end up kissing Laura. How many packs of cigarettes and gallons of alcohol did everybody consume during the film production? My goodness, had anyone told Vincent Price that he couldn't act? All in all, Laura is one of the most convoluted films noir I've seen with the most predictable who-dun-it suspect, and, in fact, it's not noir by any means. Just give me Sunset Boulevard any time of the day."
5,Winderful Movie,"Hello,I received the DVD and was very pleased with it. I have enjoyed this movie for many years and was very glad to find it on DVd.Thank you,Lynne Johnston"
2,Overhyped,"Plot falls together nicely, but one can easily figure the culprit with a little concentration. If one can get over the musical theme which is played incessantly over and over and over... one might be inclined to rate the film higher. I couldn't and won't."
2,Don't know,I bought it because I was named after this movie and yet I still haven't watched it but I will some day.
1,Not compatible with my DVD set,I wasn't told that the DVD I was to purchase could be not compatible with my DVD set. Now I know there are several zones and a DVD readable by USA devices doesn't work in Europe sets. Too late.
5,Film Noir at its best with a great cast and a surprise ending!,"Laura (1944) So Dana Andrews falls for Gene Tierney after seeing her portrait. Love at first sight? The problem is, he's a cop working on a murder case and she's the victim. Or is she? So begins one of Hollywood film noir's earliest classics. Clifton Webb is the true star in this hefty slice of suspense as the lovestruck, yet sardonic narrator. Film noir dominated 40's and 50's cinema and Laura stands as one of the finest example of the genre. The title theme itself is equally legendary."
5,The MUSIC!,"At the moment this is the only place to acknowlege the issue of the wonderful score on Kritzerland discs.Listening to the score not only evokes memories of the Film but of the time in the 1960s when I was introduced to such wonders as ""Laura"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Limelight"" .I often listen to vocal versions of ""Laura"". (How wonderful it was to hear it interpreted by Carly Simon)!Now we are able to listen to the score with the theme in all its variations. Thank you Kritzerland (and Mr Kimmel and Mr Redman)."
5,Gift,"This was a gift, so I personally did not watch it. The gentleman that I bought it for however loved the movie."
5,"Long, long Ago, A Success Story",I purchased the reading program by Glen Dolman 40 years ago. My daughter was 2 months old at the time. We began using the items supplied as soon as they were received. My baby Kristi began talking well before she was a year old and in multiple word sentences. She is now a multi-language speaking adult and translates texts in both Italian and Spanish. I believe the reading training at such an early age directly resulted in her facility for languges and the ease she experienced in learning new languages. I recommend this book and training program to any new parent without resevation. It is an investment in your childs future.
2,Images distract from the text,I understand the philosophy behind this book for teaching a child to read. However I found that the images in this book are distracting and do nothing to advance the text. It's a sweet idea to have one's child be the illustrator for one's book but in this case I don't think it worked. My daughter asked me if it bothered me if she did not use the book with her son.
5,Legend of 1900,This is undoubtedly one of the best films I have ever seen. I'm just amazed at how many people are totally unaware of this film. Such flowing romantic motion and masterful cinematic art is found in this beautifully directed and acted film. Tremendous storyline. I would suggest the film execs to re-release this one with better marketing this time...but then again those of us who are aware of it could just keep it to ourselves. Tim Roth is King.
4,Wonderful little movie,Tim Roth (Lie to Me) stars in this poingant story of an unusual man abandoned at birth on a cruise ship and never able to bring himself to walk on land. Has a great piano duel and the darndest cure for seasickness ever filmed.
2,At least I got the movie.,"I ordered the movie for my collection from Amazon. But it didn't come from Amazon. I came from an outside vendor that misrepresented it. It said it was a ""full screen"" version, but what I got was the ""wide screen"" version. Of coarse, no response from Amazon or the vendor. At least I got a copy of the movie."
1,did not work!!!,This movie did not work. I bought it cause I loved the movie... Unfortunaly I was stuck with the movie cause it didnt work on any dvd set nor x-box or playstation 3
5,Exceptional and Inspiring,"Strongly suggest this movie to everybody. The character is so fascinating, very athypical and sensible, sometimes even weird. He had never put his feet on earth, literally, he always lived on board the ship.The story is very original and unpredictable with great features. Supporting actors are also superb, the trumpet player is fun to watch, and how can i not mention the rival pianist - awesome. my best shot is when he lights his cigarette with the hot piano chords.(still can't believe it that i'm the first person reviewing this movie)I've already watched it some 6 times and I always look forward for the next opportunity."
2,Good Movie - Terrible Sound Mixing,"I emailed the following to the seller and never received a response:I saw 1900 (not in its entirely) on TV and loved the movie. I kept checking to see when it would be shown again so I could record it. Finally I ordered it and was anxious to watch it and then have some friends over to watch it.After watching it, I can't invite my friends. I had to keep turning the volume up and down. It was often so difficult to hear the dialogue and I would turn it up, then the background music/sounds would overpower the voices and be very loud and I'd turn it back down. I missed some things because I couldn't understand what they were saying. The mixing was terrible. I agree with my husband, who has a music studio and knows all about mixing.Is this a quirk in a few DVDs or all they all like this? Also, is there an edited version without so much cussing? I don't remember all of that in the TV version."
4,Beautifully filmed,"I can't say that I loved the ending, but I was captivated by this film. The music is, of course, lovely, but it was the cinematography that I thought stunning. I found myself searching through each scene for something that was a bright, apple-green."
5,Simply Awesome!!!,I saw this movie just last night on cable and I was thoroughly blown away. Tim Roth's portrayal of the tragic pianist 1900 is breath taking. A man with an limitless innate gift for playing piano who can't bear to leave the ship he calls home. The duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton was for me the highpoint of the piece. Just beautiful.
5,A film for trie Artists at heart,"I shouldn't be surprised when I checked, without naming names, several reknown film critics had given it bad reviews. I mean, REALLY bad reviews,because the way those guys do their jobs--making notes while watching films. Poor fellows, they can't watch anything without dissecting them into body parts, and the so-called film reviews end up being film-making-techniques-reviews.Upon saying so, the film was beautifully made, and impeccably acted, raw and refined at the same time. It is one of those films you would get more and more by each viewing because their story and characters are so complex in their simplicity, and so simple in their complexity. I think it's better explained in music than words--let's just put it this way. If you had seen the film, you'd know what I meant."
1,"Am I crazy, or what?","If there was a minus star, this movie would get it. Am I crazy, or what? Last night I started watching this movie, which I had rented on DVD. OK-- now my problem is this. While the movie had sound-- music, chairs being moved, crowds shouting in the background, when the charactors spoke, their lips moved and nothing came out. This went on and on, till I jumped forward to the middle of the movie, and it was the same there. Did I get a faulty copy? Blockbuster only had one copy, so that was it.From the reviews, I get the idea that this movie is very good, but frankly, I'm at a loss. What gives with the lip work?"
5,Legend of 1900,Caught part of this on TV and couldn't stop watching. Had to have it. Mostly dramatic with a little humor. Tim Roth is awesome as always. Good quality dvd.
5,A Great Movie!!!,This movie really touched me as a musician. That one mans devotion to music would be so great that he would never have to leave his ship. All he needed was an idea and the music would flow.
5,One of the best works that never made it to the US theatres,"I saw part of this movie for the first time in passing a premium cable channel. I then stalked through the guides to find out when it would be on. I watched it. I was amazed. I then spent a few hours hunting it down online, but could only find it in VHS PAL format...until just recently. Wonderful can not begin to describe the rich plot, music, and characters to this film. What amazed me more than the film was the fact it was never released in the US back in 1989. A true shame. I highly reccommend purchasing the soundtrack as well."
4,Legend of 1900,"Great music throughout the movie. A little more language than I would have cared for, though overall a good watch."
5,A Gem,"I stumbled upon this movie the weekend of the 4th of July.. since then I have watched it a dozen times and was fortunate to find the cd (music).. What a treat, the more I watch the movie-the more it eats into my heart..The characters play out their roles with poignancy and passion..This is my choice movie for 2003, last year it was Billy Elliott.."
5,Awesome Movie!,"If you love a good drama movie, you'll love this movie. A definite two thumbs up for Tim Roth who went the distance in learning to play the piano for this great movie."
3,why not?!,abstract enough for you to appreciate its symbolism visuallyfun enough for you to enjoy BAM!
3,Good but not great.,"This is a good tool for the price, but my kitchen Aid is better. This tool will cut through a thin thickness of pizza (I use it for brownies too), but it's so flimsy and many times you have to go back and forth over the same spot multiple times (and I'm a strong guy) before it makes it through thicker slices. Maybe it loses sharpness or just isn't very strong to begin with, but since it was so cheap I knew what I was getting before I bought it. The grip is great and what really gets 4 stars, but the blade isn't very sturdy. I recommend spending you money on quality rather than convenience."
3,just ok...,got this for our cabin....it's just ok...probably better deals out there and certainly there are better quality pizza cutters. It barely squeaks by as acceptable.
4,A very pleasant early bebop latin cross-over,"I have to take issue with the other review of this record. Billy Taylor never was a natural latin/afro-cuban pianist, and he never tried to compete with the likes of the Palmieri brothers, Noro Morales, Ruben Gonzales, Frank Emilio Flynn, or even George Shearing. But he was able to blend bebop and latin styles in a nice way, that made the latin rhythms accessible to the jazz mainstream. Cross section is a very good exemplar of his approach, faithful to bebop, but flexible enough to respectfully accommodate mambo. It is easy to fault the rhythm section for being restrained, but these cats never drop a beat, and the melodic/modal quality of the harmony shines throughout. This album may not get you on to the dancefloor, but then again it was never aiming to do this. It's just a great recording to listen to. If you want more genuine / percussion oriented stuff, Billy Taylor's Trio with Candido, also from 1954 may be a better choice."
3,Heart-warming and touching,This book was very good. I liked the way the author described each moment in Maya's life. I'd just like to say that if anyone wants a good biography this is it.
2,A Book in Search of a Good Editor,"While this book does contain a good deal of useful information, it is presented in a manner that cries out for a good editor. The analogy to choreography is beaten into the reader ad nauseum. This irritant distracts from what would have otherwise been an all right book on the topic. I would recommend it only because I have been able to find nothing else like it in the marketplace."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"This book is OK at best. I was looking specifically for some guidance in process definition and had high expectations for this book, especially because it's published by Addison Wesley. Unfortunately, I really didn't get much out of it. There's one thing, however, that just about drove me batty -- Caputo spends a great deal of time developing ""striking analogies to dance."" I found this rather useless. As a typical software professional, am I expected to gain insight into the items being presented with the help of a comparison to an unusual profession? Analogies can be used to aid understanding when the analogy maps the new concept onto one the audience is already familiar with. The space taken to make the constant comparisons could have been better used to provide additional annecdotal evidence."
1,Data mining....,"This book is a lot like looking for gold -- you have to spend a good bit of time searching through tons of rubble before finding a good nugget or two. If you are looking for technical/practical assistance on keys to implementing the CMM then look elsewhere; the book will do nothing but frustrate you. If you are looking for organizational and managerial help then you *might* find this book useful, but your money is probably better spent elsewhere. The book is heavy on 'organization-speak' and light on real, practical instruction. There are some good war stories, but you probably have ones of your own that are just as good and relevant. The CD and associated forms aren't very useful and they are somewhat poorly organized. The book is not totally without merit, but I still can't find anything in it that even remotely justifies its price."
1,"If you are learning CMM, this book will not help you.","The book spends an overwhelming portion of its content focusing on a ballet and how it relates to CMM. As an author, I got the impression she was using this as a technique to meet her page quota. The author overuses glittering generalizations about how to manage people and an organization. In that sense, this book is a rehash of useless management fluff from the 80s. This book contains about 15-20 pages worth of useful information and should cost $10. I will never buy a book published by UNISYS again."
5,One of the best recordings of all time.,"No question that a cappella, or any music doesn't get any better than this. The finest in songwriting and performing is shown here, so stop reading right now and just ORDER!"
3,"3-1/2 stars -- Not her best, but good enough","Lisa Loeb appears unscathed after her breakup with Mr. Zappa (maybe she realized she didn't want to be related to people named Dweezil and Moon Unit?). Accompanying her trademark look is her trademark sound, which makes much of her latest offering, The Way It Really Is, stand out.Things start off pretty okay, however, with ""Window Shopping"" and ""I Control the Sun""; actually, I really think those two songs are skippable, despite everyone else seeming to like them. But there ARE some good songs to find, like ""Lucky Me"", ""Diamonds"" and the smooth ""Try"".There are also two songs in the middle I can do without. I'm not sure what the point of ""Accident"" was, and ""Probably"" needs a much better chorus (""I probably love you""???). Oh, well; even though Lisa's capable of making better albums, the music on here is good enough to keep you interested. But improved lyrics would have made this a better album, and that's the way it really is.Anthony Rupert"
3,Not bad -- an inside look at the SEALs.,"This is a very readable novel about the SEALS that takes place during the Panama and First Gulf War eras. If you are interested in what went on during these operations, and the role that the SEALs played in them, then this book is for you. This novel offers an insightful look at the SEALs, their mission and training, and overall what the SEALs are all about.The characterizations in this novel are actually not too bad for a techno-thriller, and the reader actually comes to identify with two of the main protagonists. But the real center of this novel is the SEAL organization itself. At times the novel rehashes the politics and military issues of the Panama and Gulf War conflicts to a point where it is something of a history lesson, but by and large the novel moves along smartly, and holds the reader's interest. Three stars. Not bad at all."
5,great stools!,"My daughter and I love these stools. She likes carrying them around with the handles. The are very sturdy, she never slips on them and they don't slide around on the floor."
4,Excellent for our 3 year old,"We bought these step stools so our 3 year old can turn on his own lights and step up to the sink to brush his teeth, and reach into the top drawers in his dresser. He really like them, the thing we like the MOST about them is the little handle on the top so he can pick them up and move them around to get to his closet light/bedroom light/hall light and so on.Because the legs are wide and sturdy, the stools don't tip over too easily, granted - he IS a 3 year old and full of energy so he has tipped them over on occassion."
5,A rare great book,The book is in great condition as promised. It's a very clarifying choice for a defensive investor. Especially for those who read the intelligent investor by benjamin graham. Excellent condition and i'am very grateful. Thank you.
3,From Back Cover,"Just one night...That was all Holly Fitzgerald would allow herself with the tall, dark and brooding CFO Joe Barone. Winning Baronessa Gelati's contest paled next to what she felt when the aloof Joe watched her with sexual desire blatant in his shrewd eyes.While Holly had commitments, Joe had sophistication and wealth. He looked better in a business suit than any man had a right to. But his lover's touch freed her, and for the first time made her want something more. Like Cinderella, she'd forget the real world, forget caution and for once, she'd simply enjoy the fantasy. But as the clock neared twelve, Holly knew one night with Joe wouldn't be enough....[7th in the Dynasties: The Barones mini-series.]"
3,"Fun, but not very substantive.","This is a relatively fun romp through some very interesting concepts, but it lacks rigor. The book could have been much stronger if the author had simply developed some of the basic concepts (compactness, connectedness, homeomorphisms, homotopy, etc) rather than do a little hand-waving around a nice illustration. As it stands, this book is only 140 pages long, and does not develop any of its topics (manifolds, surfaces, graphs, knots) adequately. This book is far too weak to serve as a good text. Kinsey's TOPOLOGY OF SURFACES is much stronger, and costs less. Or look as something like Gamelin's INTRO TO TOPOLOGY. Or even Schaum's outline GENERAL TOPOLOGY, which deals with the basics, but is highly readable and rigorous."
5,"Great Product, Great Price","I had these installed these in our 740i, save mega bucks over oem cats. Good quality. Car runs and performs like new."
1,Don't bother.... JUNK,"When I connected the deviced to my computer for the first time, the drive worked, and I was able to copy files from the drive to my PC. When I connected a second or third drive, I got an error stating the Mass USB Storage Device was not properly installed. I was never able to get the device to work since. Not even with the first drive.In addition, the device is poorly made. The wires and connectors are fragile, and look like they were soldered by hand. All documentation is on a mini-cd... so if you do not have the ability to play/read mini-cds you won't be reading the documentation.You get what you pay for."
5,Imagine yourself right in the heart of Antarctica,I first purchased the record when it came out. It was a Japanese cut as this was the only version available at the time. After listening to the record I could easily imagine myself being surrounded by snow and ice. Relaxing music with which you can dream away. Then I wished for the CD version to come out. As soon as it did I bought it and still enjoy listening to it as much as I did when I first heard it.
4,Cooly elegant and mystical,"The soundtrack to Koreyoshi Kurahara's film Antartica is extremely beautiful. It is mystical and haunting. It is expansive and spiritual. I found it to be very relaxing and yet inspirational. I have never seen the Japanese film which those who have seen the film praise, but it must be exceptional if this soundtrack supports the action. I recommend this CD for anyone who appreciated the Hearts in Space series, all the selections are elegant."
4,Wonder Music for da MOOD!,"A child of the sixties, I've always eschewed anything with a synthesizer. I mean, ""microwave rock,"" and all THAT...But I had a lady friend in the early nineties who turned me onto Brian Eno, Enya, & Kitaro - and this, and well: it's lovely music to relax, shake the ennui off, and (maybe) get frisky to. Thank goodness Van never joined Yes."
2,Fluff,"After giving this CD about 7 listens over the course of a couple weeks, I put it away probably for good. The melody he relies on through the first movement and several times thereafter isn't bad but it isn't much either. I also don't like his use of the big clapping sound that was almost comically overdone as a backbeat in the 80's. Vangelis at times uses some really cool drums which makes that cheap backbeat almost like a physical shock to hear - so out of place. In fairness, that might not have been the case when this soundtrack was first written, and it might not bother somone who doesn't find it to be an 80's new age cliche sound. I just expected more meat and potatoes from the guy who wrote the virtually unsurpassed soundtrack for Blade Runner! Besides that clapping backbeat, the repetetive simple melody and some fluffy nice chord washes - I didn't find much there there..."
4,Great CD,"I like the theme music, which repeats itself throughout the various tracks. It sounds very much like Antarctica. However, I only find myself listening to a few tracks. Track 4 has a little over 2 minutes of solo reed instrument, which sounds like movie music as it doesn't create any atmosphere like the other tracks do. It then repeats track 1 after the reed solo and fades away after a few minutes, which seems kind of strange. I've never known Vangelis to do reprises. Other tracks like five just don't recapture the vastness and escapement that tracks 1 and 2 create. However, if you're wondering whether to buy it, I'll say that some of the tracks are wonderful enough that I wouldn't pass them up given another chance."
1,Terrible Movie,"I'm a huge fan of CART racing, and eagerly anticipated this movie, and was extremily disappointed when I attended the premier. Not only was the story terribly weak, but the racing scenes were unrealistic and unbelievable. When I think of the great things that could have been done to show the true nature of this great sport, I'm extremly dismayed by Harlin and Stallone's poor attempt. I would have to guess that neither of them understand or are fans of auto racing."
1,Sylvester Stallone in a racecar????,"I saw this film a few weeks ago, and have to say, to anyone who knows anything about F1 racing it will be a sore dissapointment. The sight of the two cars racing through the streets at top speed, without a care in the world would make you cry. They expect us to believe that a car with an inch of clearence below its chassis could go at that speed on commercial roads.......But allowing for that the film was just rubbish, a vehicle for Sly to show off himself again, and for Burt Reynolds to stick his head in..."
2,"""Dude, Where's My Car"" was better","Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen this year. It really was that bad. Lacking any character development, I felt no emotion towards any of the characters and considered turning it off half way through. This movie is a piece of garbage. It's got Sylvester Stallone in it and its out on dvd and it's a piece of garbage."
2,Release the Director's Cut,"With Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin behind the wheel, you would expect ""Driven"" to be more entertaining than it actually is. The deleted scenes on the DVD give you a taste of what might have been. A ""director's cut"" is definitely in order."
1,This is a Joke!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. An incredibly STUPID story, so implausable that it is insulting to the viewer. The race scenes are simply ridiculous. Memo's big crash seen is the most hoaky thing I have ever seen, Bly makes a 180 comes back jumps out of the car and into the pond to save, PLEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSEEEEEEE!!!! HOW STUPID!!! Too bad the producers and writers of this movie have never seen a CART, IRL or Formula 1 race before. This movie is so insulting to race fans because it is so STUPID!!If I could give this movie zero stars I would it is so bad."
1,The Worst Movie Ever?,"As a fan of auto racing, particularly CART and F1, I had been cautiously anticipating the release of this movie on DVD for some time. However, it turns out thatthis movie was more unrealistic than my worst fears had considered. For example, in one seen, the movies two protagonists start their race cars, and go racing around on city streats at top speed. I suppose that Stallone forgot that Indy Cars do not have their own starters, they must be started with an external starter. Nothing about the racing and wrecking is realistic, despite the fact that Sylvester Stallone was seen at several races in the year prior to this movies release.When you combine the unrealistic nature of the movie, with the complete lack of plot, and the poor acting, this movie doesn't even deserve a full star."
1,Among the worst of the worst,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I felt robbed when I saw it in the theater. Please do not make the same mistake as me.
1,Absolute junk!,"Don't waste your money. Get the following movies...Le Mans: About as real as racing can get. Just wait until the end of the first lap and you hear the roar of the Porsche engine. It gives me chills just thinking of it.Grand Prix: Great cinematography! The melodramatic story can be a bit much, but the movie in widescreen is spectacular.Days of Thunder: Just plain fun. Not that accurate, but a fun movie...and it's a Bruckheimer!Don't even bother with Driven unless you can borrow it from a friend. Don't pay to watch this piece of unrealistic, hollywood shlock."
1,Skip it Believe Me!,"When I heard this movie was coming out, in the Theater, I was so excited. I am a huge race fan, and jump at any chance to see race action on the screen. The endorcement by CART was even more of a plus for me. When I finally saw it on the screen, I could not believe it. I had never been more disappointed by a film. The acting was horrible. The special effects were impressive, but unrealistic. The race scenes were even more unrealistic, and the story did not to flow well. I could not find a connection with any of the carachters. They did not spend time developing them at all and there were just brief comments placed in the most awkward places to try and make up for it. The special effects were well made but they needed to do more studying on how the cars would react in the accidents, or how they react in a race in general. The movie need someone who was more educated in racing to help bring things together. It really had a lot of potential but in the end it fell way short."
4,Amazing!!,"This is one of best car race movies I ever seen, I just feel there is something missing to the story. I noticed that Sylvester Stallone always trying something different for the past few years. Anyway, I am an automobile / F1 races sport enthusiast so I gave it four stars. I loved the scenes and the special effects."
1,HAHAHAHA!,"I like car racing... To my humble point of view, this is one of the very worst film I have seen in my life. Everything is absurd, the actors and the story are like the worst tv soap. The caracters shows the most primary psychology you can imagine. Everything is a laughable exageration. Yes, I had a good time seeing this film just to see the incredible number of absurdities and bad sequence one after another. I THINK THIS FILM HOLDS THE ABSOLUTE WORLD RECORD OF the worst scenario. Hollywood at its very worst. A real satiric comedy."
2,"This film is ""rocky"", not Rocky","If you are a real Sylvester Stallone fan and love car racing, you might be able to find some redeeming feature in the movie, but otherwise it might be a good idea to pass it by. Stallone's character is an over-the-hill race car driver who is called back to his racing team to help groom a talented but inconsistant rookie driver. The writing is pretty bad and doesn't give the actors much to work with. It's difficult to imagine that drivers would stop in the middle of a race to help an injured driver, but that's what Stallone would have us believe. The story is stilted and predictable, but there are a few interesting race scenes."
1,Worst car movie ever made. Complete crap!,"If Mr. Stallone was such a great race fan as he claims to be, he would have taken the time to be sure the technical details of the film were correct, even if he didn't have a story.Point: Exploding race car filled with methanol fuel does not burn yellow like gasoline does. It is colorless, maybe slightly blue.Point: Burning methanol fuel does not spread over the surface of a pond or lake, it mixes with water and goes out.Obvious computer generated action sequences and effects only make this film more laughable than it would be. The cast looks like they are straight out of a Japanese animated TV series as well.Steve McQueen didn't have a story for Le Mans, but he let the racing action speak for him. If only there were some realistic action in this film to speak for Stallone we would all have been better off.This film belongs in the $0.99 discount bin."
2,"If you are a racing fan, this movie's good for a laugh...",I get suckered into thinking racing movies will actually be good each time one comes out...'Driven' got me again...This movie would have been palatable had ridiculous scenes such as a car leaving the track and exploding through trees and landing upside down in a lake been omitted. And Burt Reynolds forcing Kip Pardue to jump up and down on a broken ankle to prove he's fit to race? C'mon Renny and Sly! give even your slower audience members a bit of creditTo all NON-race fans...PLEASE do not think that real racing is anything close to what you witnessed here (hint: the real thing's better!)
5,ACTION!,"I have watched my VHS copy of Driven raw. That is why I am getting it on DVD now. I was reading some reviews from the people that gave this film 1 star. they were saying well this can't happen and that is not real. Well all I have to say to that is Superman isn't real, Spiderman isn't real, and I bet you watch those MOVIES. My point is, it is a MOVIE, it was made to entertain you, if you want REAL then watch the REAL thing, not a MOVIE!!!!! All in all this movie is filled with action and romance. And yeah the story line may follow a little like Days of Thunder but hey with this movie you get STALLONE!!!!!! What could be better than that?"
3,It was alright,"I watched this movie with a friend of mine last weekend at my house and I thought that this movie was only alright at best, they're were some classic scenes like when two guys were drag racing out in the streets or when they survived a car crash which ended up being engulfed in flames, also this movie has long time veteran actors Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds and this movie reminds me of Stroker Ace (which starred Burt Reynolds) and I loved the scene when Estella Warren was wearing red leather pants and I just love it when I get to see a woman dressed in leather pants."
4,A Great Movie!,"Driven is a movie about a young, troubled Formula 1 racer, who gets help from a retired man (Stallone), who was a great racer himself, back in the day.This movie has the craziest crash scenes, some of the best actors, and is overall a great movie. While having a small romance twist to it, Driven is well-balanced.The DVD has many great features, including about a half hour or more of deleted scenes, how the movie was made, at least an hour of the director's comments and way more.Fans of racing or not, this is an awesome movie for everyone."
1,"What was going through Stallone's mind, for Heaven's sake???","This movie is nothing. No wonder it got seven nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards...Stallone has a respectable history in movie making... he knows this is a turkey. Harlins also knows. But what they also know is that, no matter the garbage they release, there are people that will buy it and review it very positively!! That's why! DRIVEN is so bad, I mean so bad, that you almost laugh sometimes... By the way, I love car racing, that's one mroe reason to hate this movie. (I'm not talking about the plot, the acting, the dialogues... it's useless)"
3,Average,"People who go to see a racing movie and think that it is going to mirror the reality of the track are always going to be disappointed. Hollywood may not have it within it to make a realistic movie. Days of thunder certainly isn't realistic to the racing.If you are going to get any enjoyment at all from this film you are going to have to go in with an open mind. That this is a movie and will have movie racing, movie plots and movie attitudes.If you can go in with an open mind then you may find it a fun film, it deals more with the relationships than with racing in many ways. Sly is quite good and was enjoyable to watch.I loved the racing through city streets was alot of fun. The worst thing was the crashes. They were very dramatic but maybe with the height the cars got, they should have painted them in the Thunderbirds colours."
4,Feel the wind.,"A new star and a old star cooperate and get the top.A race scene is very exciting. Especially, driving on a public way is unblievable.Indeed, a story line is poor, but you must be satisfied only with the racing scenes.I think acting is good. You won't be disappointed.Thank you."
1,"Seriously, the worst movie I've ever seen!","I was not expecting much at all from a Stallone movie, but still, a friend of mine, also fan of F1 racing, finally convinced me to go to see it. Not only is there no story at all, but even car racing sequences are totally unrealistic. It makes you wonder whether or not you are watching a parodia of another even more useless movie. At least, when Austin Powers was parodying James Bond, one could laugh. Here, you don't, and you'd find yourself regularly checking your watch just to find out that there is still way too much time left for enduring this terrible movie! Regardless of who you are, save your bucks for a drink or two when you attend a real race."
2,Could have been good,"The commentary and deleted scenes narrated by Stallone are worth the rental or purchase of this DVD. The movie stinks, but what the movie was supposed to be is very good and moving. Stallone takes you through the entire ""writers/actors"" cut and you see a real story with interesting characters and movtivations develop.The ""real"" reason Stallone is called up by the Burt Reynolds character is touching, dramatic and true. It is ashame that people who saw this movie in the theaters never got to see this.Editing ruined this film."
4,"Good, but...","I am a die-hard racing fan. I like everything from NASCAR to 1/4 midgets. However, this movie, while some of the scenes are very well done (driving in Champ Cars through Downtown Chicago), but the story is lacking. Movie is very comparablable to Days of Thunder where you have old crew chief helping young driver. Here you have old driver helping young driver. Days of Thunder definately had a little more story and better racing scenes as they travelled to Dover, Rockingham, Darlington and Daytona amoung other places. Most of the footage for Driven was shot in and around Chicago. Look at most of the starter's stand and see it's the same thing, just different signage. Most racing action was filmed at Chicago Motor Speedway in Cicero. Also Days of Thunder have hatred turn to friendship, Driven does, but not as strongly. Bottom line is that Driven will not help CART like Days of Thunder helped NASCAR."
1,I didn't know a movie could be that bad!!,"I have never seen such a horrible movie!! Seriously, I heard it was bad but I love racing so I thought ""even if it's a bad story, at least the race scenes will be cool"" WRONG....the special effects are cheap and overdone. It doesn't even come close to looking real. Please, save your money and keep the little bit of respect you have left for Stallone...."
1,Stallone is Provolone -- CHEEZE -- BAD FOR THE SPORT,"I have never been witness or had to sit through a more painful 88 minutes. I'm a racing fan, but this flick did nothing but denegrate the sport to the level of smut. Stallone clearly didn't have a knowledge of the sport nor did the director possess the intelligence to understand how to visually leverage the spectacle, technology and thrill that open-wheel racing delivers to fans around the world. It is an embarassement to the sport. They should ban these people from any race tracks."
5,Great movie...... Even if your not into car raceing!!!!,"Iam not a fan of car raceing eather,,,,,,This movie is GREAT!!! you should hear it in SOUROND SOUND!!!!!!! If you have the right stero and have the volume just right you can close your eye and it LITERLY feels like your their!!!.Anyway the movie is quite oranized it so good youde actully think about doing this for a liveing yourself! lolHas a grea set of actors, to bad it didnt get the popularity it deserves!!!!!!!I would buy it, its a great collitable DVD!!!!and how about a Driven II!!!!!!!??????"
3,Good Intentions I Suppose,"This film is definitely not character-driven. In fact each character is barely given a thumbnail sketch. It has the feel it was taken from some cardboard outline drafted by a screenwriter on his lunch break. Direction is also at a bare minimum, but this is a trend that we are seeing more frequently with more recent action oriented films. Directors are taking a back seat to the editors and this film seems to be definitely editor-driven. Digital editing is a tool and like every tool it is only as good as the hand using it. It is good to see Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds in the same movie but this should have and could have been a much better film. If you watch John Frankenheimer's GRAND PRIX it becomes very evident how filmmaking and story telling has changed in 35 years."
2,Boring...,"I watch the worldwide Formula One Grand Prix regularly and I must say this movie was no comparison, in my biased opinion. The cars just seemed to fall apart too easily - which led to some spectacular crashes, I do admit. I found the whole love story theme pretty boring - especially the (...) who switches between the two top drivers. The only reason I give it two stars is because I thought Sylvester Stallone sounded like Mel Gibson..."
1,Gave it 1 start because 0 wasn't available,"This movie would only be watchable by people who know NOTHING (and I mean nothing - like less then my wife - who I might add thinks that Formula 1 is abrand of baby formula). It is filled with absolutely laughable impossibilities (dozens . . . maybe hundreds) like being able to jump into an IndyCar, turn the key (connected to the non-existent built-in starter), and take off down city streets at 200+. A complete and side-splitting comedy for any race fan who was unlucky enough to buy (or rent) this piece of rediculous junk thinking they were about to watch a ""Real Racing Movie"". It get's my vote for the ""Top 10 Worst"" movies list."
1,Driven to madness....,"I can't believe it.... Stallone, how could you write this...? ..., sheer B-Movie, my friends! At least i could laugh a lot. THey should sell it as a comedy. But, as they did not, I rented it thinking it would be a good car racing movie. And I assure you: it is not."
1,"It's not ""Rocky""","Sly Stallone wrote this script, but he also wrote the script for Rocky. It wasn't a brilliant one, but at least Rocky was a much better film that this total waste of film.This movie has no redeeming qualities to it, I can't even think of one reason why I would recommend it. I thought it was boring, and the race car sequences were just okay.Stallone tried to throw romance(lame try) and action and sports together. I think he was trying to appeal to everyone, but I don't think it appeals to anyone. This movie was badly acted, and the script was awful(Rocky script was much better), and it has been done far too many times before.Skip it..and watch Rocky again."
1,This movie was the worst,This movie was horrible i would not even give it a star i would give it half it was pointless movie and it was just horrible.
1,Beyond Bad Beyond Horrible,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, no racing action, no anything. It is pathetic and the biggest waste of money a person could make on ANY movie. Just Horrible. Run, run as fast as you can."
3,Typical Stallone Movie,"This movie is entertaining. You don't need to think alot, just sit back and be entertained. The racing scenes are good, and the speed scene through Chicago was fun to watch. Enjoy"
2,"Should be called Drivel, not Driven","It was slightly entertaining, but don't expect anywhere near decent acting performances from Sylvester Stallone or Burt Reynolds. Motorsports movies are rarely good and this one follows that trend."
1,ANOTHER LOSER FROM STALLONE,"The only half decent part of this movie is the mildly exciting street racing scene. Screenwriter/Producer/Star Stallone mumbles his way through his own bad dialogue and Burt Reynolds looks like he's about to drop dead of embarressment, though he; like Stallone, has made more than his share of turkeys throughout his career. Director Renny Harlin (who can do much better) even throws in some cheesy computer graphics of racing during the climax. Does he really think viewers are that stupid? I give this one and a half stars because its very ineptness is what makes it (at times) unintentionally funny."
2,Ehhhhhh,"This was just too hip and flashy for me. This is for racecar fans only. I love Sly (The Specialist, Tango & Cash, Rocky, Lock Up, etc) but he's not very active here.I don't like like racecar driving but I still bought it because it had Sly in it. So it's kinda dissapointing unlike Happy Gilmore (with Adam Sandler) where non-golf fans can like it too.I give it 2 stars for the plethora of extra features. Also has Burt Reynolds (Pups)."
2,"ok movie, but the dvd skips","The movie is ok i guess it won't win any awards and story is very weak, but the race scenes are good but the movie skips I bought one and then took it back and exchanged it and skiped in the smane place i tried it in two players. Don't buy it it will skip and you may not as lucky as i was too get your money back after youve tried two dvds."
1,Drivel,"I totally disagree with the opening statement that all racing movies are ""clunkers""....despite their faults, Grand Prix and LeMans are classics for their riveting analog real time footage..but Driven? aside from some real time CART clips from the 1999 season, the movie is totally preposterous, the special digital effects are ludricrous, the story is ridiculous, the acting is incredulous...this makes ""Days of Thunder"" look like ""Lawrence of Arabia""!!....just watched it again the other day and it's only gotten worse...ouch!!"
3,A Taste of Formula One,"This film was actually produced due to Sylvester Stallones recent fondness of Formula One racing. After seeing a few, Sly felt there really had not been a film done on the sport which also showed ""behind the scenes."" The film shows a few drivers in various aspects of their lives in Formula One and the movie has a pretty good story all in all. The camera shots and special effects are wonderful and actually credible, especially if you are a fan of the sport like I am. This is no Oscar-worthy film by any means, but definately good enough and entertaining enough to watch. Because of the shots taken and being a fan of Formula One and Indy racing, I opted to buy this movie. I'm not a real big fan of Sly's, but I do, like everyone else, end up watching his movies. Bottom line-A good movie depicting various aspects of the sport, credible performances with plenty of action without be ""over the top."""
3,"Nice Cars, Nice People & Film Non-Racing Fans Can Enjoy","This movie was definitely better than I anticipated. (I had low expectations.) There are some fantastic Formula I driving and crash scenes in here, and the sound of engines was fun to hear. I make those statements despite not being much of an auto racing fan, either.Another appealing aspect was that the three lead characters were all good guys. There are annoying ""bad people"" in the movie but they are all minor characters.The ending is predictable and, yes, there are some of the typical things you see and hear in many Sylvester Stallone films but not as dumb as many of them (the bad ones, that is.)Because of the superlative visuals and audio, this is a good movie to see on a nice TV and a nice surround system. Mine are okay but I can imagine what this would look and sound like on something really good."
4,Good Competition,This showed the lives in the racing circut. A lot of times it is not all fun and games. You have to learn how to balance the two. Sometimes things go wrong and you have to roll with the punches.
2,"naughty, naughty","If you're into foul language and boredom, this is the film for you. Geared for the 13-year-old male, this lame duck tries to shock as well as amuse. It's all so dreadfully dull. My copy goes into the waste bin. Chalk up another stinker for Dan Aykroyd. Did Walter Mathau need the money?"
2,fairly average film,say this film the other night&while the cast was interesting&certain things worked overall the story itself never quite jived with all the Folks involved within the film.things seemed a bit off.Dan Aykroyd was pretty good here as was Walter Matthau but the film just didn't move me enough.
1,Buggy product-- consider PC-Cillin 2005 instead,"Like another reviewer mentioned, Norton's Antivirus product gets more buggy with every new release. Norton's customer service is non-existent with FAQ with some suggestions which simply do not work.Instead, I recommend Trend Micro's PC-cillin Internet Security 2005. PC-cillin has worked well, scans fast, with frequent updates to their database. It has already prevented several new viruses from taking up residence in my computers."
1,Do Not Buy Norton,"I purchased the Norton AV 3 pack. It would not load on one computer and cheated us out of a month on the subscription on another. Norton never answered any emails or online complaints sent to them. Now to make it worse all 3 computers that were running with Norton AV 2006 have been infected with a virus and are inoperable. The cost to repair will be in the hundreds. Norton AV was updated and run on every computer everyday, but the virus was not detected. Run as fast as you can from this product."
5,Norton Antivirus 2005 Home Protection Pack-3 Users,"I'm very happy with the ease of installation and use of this product. The automatic updates allows me the peace of mind that my machines are safe with current upgraded protection. With Norton's reputation and continued high performance in computer protection, I feel I received a product of the utmost quality. I strongly recommend it."
1,Bad product,"It slows down your computer, even if you have the most powerful processor. Acts like a trial version asks you to activate every week. Strongly advise against buying"
1,Has anyone tried renewing their 3 User subscription yet?,"They are now telling me that I have to pay $25 per machine to renew the subscription! This is more than the cost of buying the product brand new through their web-site. So much for customer service/retention.Looks like I will be shoveling more driveways this fall/winter to pay for this baloney. Or wait, maybe I will switch to an open source solution. Hmmm..."
3,STOP,"STOP, before buying this product. Download a demo from the symantec web-site, cross your fingers and see if it works first, before you hand over your hard earned cash for a product that may be useless to you.There are just too many bad reports on the internet about this Norton product not working. There are also lots of good reports on Norton Antivirus 2005 working exceptionally well. So that is why I would recommend you try the demo first.I couldn't get Norton Antivirus 2005 to work on an older Computer running Windows98, so I ended up trying out PC-cillin which couldn't get rid of a certain viruse that kept re-installing itself on my computer. So I did a bunch of on-line research and found a better product called NOD32. Not very user friendly, but the most highly rated Antivirus software out there."
3,Painful start,"The installation is painful, with restarts and error messages one after the other. I had to uninstall and reinstall the product 4 times and even after that the Live Update kept on refusing to update the trusted data base and the installation window kept on popping up by itself trying to configure the system.... again!Eventually it has settled down (by itself) and it does its thing. Buy it if you enjoy self-punishment."
2,"Not *the* worst ever, but OXO can do better","1) The points hardly make a dent... unless you slip while scooping in which case they puncture holes through the ice cream box quite nicely.2) After a period of use and runs through the dishwasher, the chrome comes off.Bottom line - we've abandoned this scoop in favor of a spoon."
2,"over time, not dishwasher safe",I've had this item several years and the scooper is coroding from being washed in the dishwasher. I'm going to get a stainless steel one next.
2,Leaks water,"The grip is indeed good, and the scoop works well, even with hard ice cream. This product has an annoying flaw, however. When you wash it, water gets trapped in some tiny nooks and crannies. Then, when you are scooping ice cream, especially ice cream that's straight out of the freezer, the pressure from scooping opens up these nooks and crannies (e.g., around where the scoop shaft joins the handle) and water starts dribbling out and down into the ice cream container.If you only use this scoop occasionally, I imagine the water trapped inside would have evaporated. Since we tend to use our scoop every week or so, this water dribble happens frequently. I'd recommend taking a pass on this scoop."
2,Worked for a while...,then the metal on the scoop started to peel off and left metal shavings in my ice cream!
2,Not very sturdy,"My son works at a ice cream shop, and when I recieved this ice cream scoop, he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal, but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time, I was scooping out very hard ice cream, and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
1,Worse than my gardening scoop!,"Pros:1. easy to find (almost every store carrys it)2. nice grip3. may be good for gardeningCons:1. very light; hardly strong enough to fight with well-frozen ice cream2. the surface wears off (I never put it in the dishwasher or use harsh detergent, rough cleaning pads)3. I'm not sure how to recycle this; is it plastic or metal?"
2,the handle fell off,"I haven't been eating THAT much ice cream! The handle fell off as I was scooping ice cream for impatient children. I kept scooping with just the scoop part and cut my hand on the jagged broken part. While my cut has nothing really to do with the poor quality of the scoop, it not being designed for use once broken, it did add to the annoyance factor."
1,Try the other scoop first!,I could not use this scopp. The squishy parts of the grip seemed to be on the wrong sides of the handle. I could not get the right leverage with the pointed part of the scoop. It made it painful to get out the ice cream. I love Oxo tools however so tried the round ice cream scoop with the bail to pop out the ice cream. It works great.
1,"Cheap metal, cheap coating.","How many things can actually go wrong with an Ice Cream Scoop?As others have said, the coating on our scoop is pitting... I just find this unacceptable. Not sure about you, but I don't want to be eating little pieces of chrome with my ice cream.Oh, we also don't use a dishwasher, so this is from hand washing."
3,"Good, but not the best","This is a good ice cream scoop if you're just looking for something at a reasonable price and is very comfortable. I think those are the two biggest advantages of this utensil. The bad thing is that it's not the most durable. For the most durable, you'll want to look for a one piece metal scoop. This one works best if you dip it in hot water first to heat it up and then scoop out your ice cream. This will make the ice cream a little more easy to handle as the tool can kind of melt it's way through. Dip it back in the hot water before each scoop. This tip can be applied to all ice cream scoopers."
5,quick shipping,"Haven't used the ice cream scoop yet but it was shipped quickly and delivered as described. Bought it for my mom, who swears by the metal scoop (vs. plastic, etc) Hopefully it'll last 7 years like our last one, which recently saw its last day."
5,Awesome scoop for young coconuts,"I love young coconuts for smoothies, puddings and creamy desserts. I needed a sturdy scoop to scrape out the young coconut meat. This scoop has the perfect round shape, strength, and great grip to scoop inside the husk, and the corners help to scrape out every last bit of goodness. I throw all it into a blender with the coconut water, add fresh fruit and ice, and blend it into the best, healthiest ""ice cream"" ever."
3,"Works Well, Concerned about Longevity","This scoop has a comfortable handle and a good shape for attacking hard ice cream straight out of the freezer. The chrome finish is attractive and seems like it would be more durable and dishwasher-safe than the ridiculous (and unnecessary) non-stick finish I have on my other Oxo scoopOXO Good Grips 26481 Nonstick Beak Ice Cream Scoop. I prefer to dip this in water before use (so it will glide through the ice cream), and to wash it by hand afterward. This isn't an all-metal scoop, like theOXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop, so I'm a little concerned about its longevity."
2,Don't bother,"This ice cream scooper is horrible! It will not pierce hard frozen ice cream and when you finally get through the ice cream sticks to it and you have to ""dig"" the ice cream off. I am not a big fan of OXO because the last few items I have purchased have been over priced junk. Spend the money, get an Zeroll."
5,Great Icecream Scoop,"This scoop gives you a couple of great advantages that others don't provide. First, the large, rubber like handle gives you great gripping power to dig into hard ice cream. Second, the leading edge of the scoop has a semi sharp edge on it -- which really helps it cut through as you push and and makes the job easier. Oxo makes good products, and this is one of them I would highly recommend."
4,I Love Me Some Ice Cream,"After using spoons and making them bend all the time from the hard ice cream, I bought the OXO Good Grips Points Ice Cream Scoop. It is a terrific scooper, and I prefer the points that it has over a completely rounded scoop because it can grab hold of the ice cream better, and that makes for quicker scooping. The one thing I would say that I don't like; is the handle is removable, and so after running it through the dishwasher the first 2 times, I had water leaking out. Then, I pulled the handle and found that it pulls right off. Not sure this is the greatest invention for a handle, however now I know to pull the handle off and put the pieces in the dishwasher separately. As usual, this product stands up to the OXO good name."
2,FOR COLLECTORS ONLY,"This 1955 effort for Prestige is marred for me by vocalizing on 2 tracks and rather loud congo playing from Candido on several others. Fortunately Bennie and Charlie Rouse returned to the studio several years later and recorded BACK ON THE SCENE for Blue Note. It is much the better of the two and is included in the 3 CD box set which gives you 5 LPs worth of music,including SOUL STIRRIN--WALKIN AND TALKIN and more."
4,great in-home unit!,I love this unit in my home ran into free left and right rca inputs in my receiver. It works great and the station storage is easy to use. I am disappointed with it in my car. It broadcasts an FM signal to your car stereo and in my car the Kenwood deck has to be in one exact place to work at all and then the reception is poor. I just don't bother anymore and will get a separate car unit eventually. I wished I had saved some money and bought one without the car kit but I don't begrudge the cost since it works so well in the house.
1,Dont go to Harvard because of this,"WHAT A DIssapointment......just finished watching it.......I love Sarah....but What the heck was going on.......wasted 4 bucks on a rental......I rented it for Sarah.....she looks great, and did fine......but the story could have been so much better........good actors, bad story.......if u rent that is fine, but dont say I didnt warn u"
2,Harvard Man,"Two stars for having Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ray Allen in believable and well-portrayed roles. Otherwise this (deservedly) direct-to-video movie is a mess filled with extraneous jump-cuts, overdone acid-trip subjective view effects, cliched mob boss scenes, gangsters so stupid that it's not funny, and even dumber FBI agents. Don't trust ryan deffley's review, he couldn't even get the facts straight in his synopsis. (the mob boss DID NOT want or instigate the point-shaving scheme)Adrian Grenier did a creditable job as the main character who tries to find meaning in life, but at the end settles for being himself and doing what he enjoys. For a better movie involving gambling, gangsters, and getting out of trouble, try _Rounders_.Al Franken's appearance as himself was fun."
2,meh~,could've been better. sarah michelle gellar isn't so great in it and niether is rebecca gayheart. i love the scene when adrian grenier's character is rolling. now that's an actor! it's basically a story of a basketball player that suddenly needs a lot of money to help his parents and gets tied up in mob business. you just have to see it for yourself...especially if you are an adrian grenier fan~
2,"interesting, but rental-worthy only","i wanted to like this movie, as i live near harvard (yes, ""harvard man"" was very obviously shot in cambridge) and i adore sarah michelle gellar. but this is a very poorly written movie; the actors do the best they can, but the dialogue is trite and frankly the leading man is entirely unsympathetic. once the acid-trip sequence is a half hour old, you will be hoping he just dies so the movie will end.i guess this thing is sort of ok, but rent before buying."
1,Save yourself the 2 hours,"I'm not even sure how long this movie dragged on, it seemed at least 2 1/2 hours.. 95% of this movie is filmed with some wierd filter or effect that tints everything red and underexposes anything white, which drove me nuts. The plot is just terrible, and the acting even worse. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams are the only decent thing about this movie, and even their quality acting is degraded by this script. The LSD scenes are a beginners tutorial in kai's power goo, and the overall message of the film is on par with the just-say-no campaign. I like to rent B movies and see what young and unseen directors and actors can do, but seriously.. this is a pile of crap, save your money."
3,Harvard Man,"Quick shipment, didn't like the movie as much as i thought i would though! The acting wasn't all that great and it was a little boring. but I love sarah michelle gellar!"
3,"Not the greatest, but, it wasn't bad","Parts of it were funny! Strong acting and an not so excellent plot! Gellar, once again, is the reason why I watched this(like Scooby Doo and Cruel Intentions) Although the other two were better, this wasn't too bad, definetely not as bad as people are saying, but I could understand why! Adrian's parents are stripped from their homes, and need money to get one, $100 000! Cindy(Sarah Michelle Gellar) is one who is able and willing to give him that money! He also meets his professor(Joey Lauren Adams(Michael)) who happens to fall in love with! Anyways, it's not bad, not the greatest, but it'll do!"
1,Very Dissappointing !!!,"Like most reviewers, I rented this movie because Sarah Michelle Geller was in it. I am a HUGE fan of Buffy and her other movies such as Scream and the Grudge. She is an extrememly talented acctress and after watching this movie I can't imagine WHY she agreed to star in this film. Quit simply it was horrible. Some of the sex scenes she had were too racy for my taste and just dissappointing that she would agree to sell herself like this. Oddly enough after this movie her next 2 hits would be the Family movies - Scooby Doo and Scooby Doo part 2. I read on alot of fan sites that they were upset in her role in this movie. After this her roles were MUCH more carefully chosen. Thank Goodness !! If you are still unsure .. I highly suggest renting this instead of spending your $$ on purchasing it."
5,Great Hammer,this hammer met all my expectations from a great company like Estwing. I fully expect this hammer to last the rest of my life and probably my son's life too.
4,Excellent Western From One of The All-time Great Directors,"John Sturges' name is not spoken nearly enough when the great film directors are being listed. You would think that after directing The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape, and The Old Man and the Sea that he would be revered and recognized, but that is not the case.Sturges was at his best making Westerns, and The Law and Jake Wade was a great one. It was the last great movie Robert Taylor made, and one of the best that Richard Widmark ever made.Taylor plays Jake Wade, a lawman who breaks Richard Widmark out of jail. They used to ride together as outlaws, and Widmark's character saved Taylor's life, so he feels indebted to Widmark. All Widmark cares about is the stolen loot hidden from their last big heist, and he forces Taylor to take him to its location.Tense, suspenseful, and well-acted, The Law and Jake Wade is a must-see Western."
3,Quality western,"The Law and Jake Wade is an entertaining western about a reformed outlaw trying to escape his past. Jake Wade, played by Robert Taylor, is trying to go straight only to run into his former gang led by Richard Widmark. A past incident involving hidden money leads Widmark to kidnap Wade and his fiancee. He leads them into the desert where they fight off Comanches as well as themselves.This is a good movie that most western fans will enjoy. Taylor and Widmark are very good as ex-partners who reunite. As another reviewer points out, there seems to be a real friendship between the two men. The showdown at the conclusion is very well done if a little predictable. Nevertheless, this is a good movie that looks better in letterbox as I saw it on TCM. Very entertaining and well worth the watch!"
5,Violence and Regrets,"This neglected Western is one of John Sturges best. Richard Widmark and Robert Taylor are compelling as former partners now on opposite sides of the law. There is a lingering sense of regret between the two protagonists that is rare in movies. And for all his villiany, there is something very likable about the Widmark character. This is a character driven Western at its best. Except for the Boetticher and Mann films, there is not much better. Another great Western with this theme that is hard to find (because it is out of print) is Last Train from Gun Hill."
5,Great Western!,"Robert Taylor is at his best in this horse opera. The good guy always wins, a prime example. Loved it!"
3,Tony Land's Review,"I remember when I first saw this movie many years ago that I thought it was a great western, well having moved on, it now seems pretty average and very predictable. Richard Widmark is always good to watch and he makes a great baddie, it's the sneer that gets you. Robert Taylor was never what you'd call a dynamic actor, he looks good but seems as if he was going through the motions for the money and the lady Patricia Owen definitely wasn't very comfortable in this movie. The story line is a bit weak, the bad guys do a good job. It really needed the Clint Eastwood touch for the final scenes to build the tension, it had great potential but just didn't quite cut it. Still worth a watch, if only to see Richard Widmark."
4,A nearly classic,"Taylor and Widmark are a good team in this classic western. They also have very good supporters, like Robert Middleton in the cast. One of the great films by John Sturges."
1,BEWARE....this is the cut version....NOT WIDE SCREEN,"This film was made with widescreen, 2:35 to 1 ratio but has been issued on DVD with 1/3 or more of each shot cut out for old television screens. Why did I just pay a huge amount of money for a wide screen plasma TV to be insulted by movie makers too cheap to issue the film as it was shot and shown in theaters?"
3,Spooky goings on in Rio De Janeiro,"This is a neat little film revolving around a young girl from Finland who comes to Rio De Janeiro to investigate the death of her sister and gets involved with some practicioners of the Santeria religion. Please be warned that this movie alternates between Portugese, Finnish and English ( in that order) with NO SUBTITLES so I guess the more multi-lingual you are the better you'll understand the story. And yes, it appears to be a deliberate choice of the director to not sub-title the film as you'll find out if you pay attention during the first five minutes of the movie. If you like spooky films and you don't mind not understanding what anybody is saying 2/3's of the time, give it a shot."
1,Daughters of Yemanja,I purchased this movie and didn't like it mainly because most of the dialouge was in Portuguese with no sub-titles. I never could get the gist of the story other than a young Finnish woman came to Rio De Janeiro in search of her sister. Due to the language barrier I never knew what happened to her sister's whereabouts or each of the character's relationship to each other. The reason that I gave this review a 1 star was because of the soundtrack which to me was the only good thing about this movie. I don't recommend this movie unless you understand Portuguese. For English speaking viewers this movie is just a bunch of disjointed film sequences amidst a great soundtrack.
3,fucking crazy movie....,"I'm brasilian, thanks good I speak portuguese and english but unfortunetly I don't speak suomi.. How come they put 3 language in a movie without subtitle? Crazy, vety crazy movie...."
4,Gregory Corso fans....this is a treat!,"If your a fan of Gregory Corso poetry, then hearing him read his poems ""spoken word style"" is a real treat. You'll love this cd.....nuff said."
5,So far so good,"It's been plug and play (using WinXP & USB). I've been using dual layer 8.5 Gig discs without any problems. The unit also shipped with a suite of Nero software (Nero 6, Nero Backup, etc)."
1,A Cure For Insomnia,The blurbs on the cover praise the author and compare him to LeCarre. He is like LeCarre; they both have the ability to take an exciting premise and reduce it to dry dust with endless dialogue and irrelevant digression. A missle hits a building and fails to detonate; its lethal cargo of germs is contained. The rest of the book is devoted to finding the perps. It ends with the old cliche; most baddies captured but the real ringleader begins all over again to build a new evil gang. Give me a break!
4,this is an anthology,"I can't very well call this CD a greatest hits package as this band has never had a hit record (at least by Billboard standards.) A great bar band that you had to see live to truly appreciate. Putting their cover version of Babs Streisand's ""People"" as the 3rd track in was a mistake, but it gives you an idea of what these guys might pull in concert. Ya hadda be there!"
5,Works great!,"I was very pleased with this purchase. It fits very nicely into my vertical Brinkmann propane smoker. It fits in a lot more ribs and the flavor was just as good. I was worried about there being too many ribs in the smoker, and that perhaps it would take longer, but they cooked up in the same amount of time and were delicious!"
2,Soy Chips,Very tasty but leave a funny taste in your mouth ( an after taste) funny. I would try something different next time.
1,NOT a good fogless mirror.,"This mirror is nothing but junk. It may work fine for a couple of weeks, but that's about it. The suction cups don't hold for more than 2 or 3 days (then comes crashing down), and the fog-free aspects (which is the reason you buy it, right?) is a joke. Run away from this brand."
5,works great!,i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he says it works great. the razor holder wont hold the type of razor he uses but i dont think he really cares from what he says he is extremely satisfied.
2,My opinion,"My fogless mirror was anything less than fogless. I was disappointed in this product, despite the fact that the magnifying feature worked like a charm. It has already fallen apart on me too. Not durable at all. I wouldn't buy one again."
1,Defective,"When I first received this product, I didn't realize that the blurriness of the mirror was due to an actual defect in the mirror. I thought it was blurry because it wasn't clean. Not until I applied the ""fog-free"" solution did I realize that there were tiny little scratches causing the mirror to look deformed. On top of that, this wasn't even that cheap! I would not recommend this product."
2,Fog Mirror,This mirror is not what you expect it to be. A complete fog mirror. It is hard to see when you arer shaving. This is not a good choice.
2,Fogless? Not quite,"The mirror was in fact fogless for about 6 months, and I was satisfied. Now fogs immediately and is difficult to see in. I would have paid more for a product with a bit more longevity. Also feels flimsy, cheap."
3,"cheap, but does the trick, at least for a while","I've never heard of a fogless mirror that would last much longer than a year, so might as well not fork out $50-$100 bucks when this one is $20."
5,great mirror,I bought this for my husband last year and he seemed to enjoy it. We put it up over a year ago and the suction cups have held it in place with no issues. My husband just asked for another one for our other bathroom so I figured I'd write a review while ordering a second one.
4,So far so good.,"I had been shaving in the shower for years. When I bought my condo 6 years ago I could not get the shower head off my shower and was afraid I would twist it off. I therefore could not reattach my shower mirror that ran the water through it.After not having a shower mirror for all those years I decided to give this one a try. I have only had it for a couple weeks.The suction cup mount promptly fell right off the wall, but the two sided tape holds solid. The reflection is good and I'm back to shaving in the shower!!"
1,Reduced the water pressure of my shower head,"Horrible, it totally reduced the water pressure of my shower head. Not a good idea to buy a mirror that diverts the water from the shower head through the mirror."
2,Cheap Basic Mirror,"At first, we really liked it. It comes with 3 suction cups, and didn't fog up....at first. However, we've had it up there just over 30 days and it has fallen twice, and now its starting to fog up already. We made sure the surface was clean, and cleaned the suction cups again, and tried again. Still fogging up but hasn't fallen again yet... so far I am not impressed. If you have the patience for it, and just want a basic cheap shower mirror, this could work, but if you want reliability and true fog-free mirror, you're best to buy something else."
3,On my fourth mirror.,"The mirrors are designed nicely and work well. Over time, they degrade. The mirror material starts coming off and eventually the mirror becomes obscure. You should get about a year or less out of them."
3,Almost works,"Positives:Sticks well to the shower enclosure. It actually has three different ways to hang the mirror - stick it with suction cups, hang it on a nail, place it somewhere.If you wet the mirror, it works. No fogging etc.The magnification option works well. It's easy to magnify while shaving and at the highest magnification I can literally see every hair on my face. :)Negatives:You need to wet the mirror before you can use it or it fogs up. You also need to periodically wet it after a few minutes or it gets little drops all over and nothing is visible. Not exactly fogging, but large drops.However, for this price its a good mirror. If you don't mind splashing it a bit every 5 minutes or so, which I don't."
2,Worked great... For about four months.,"This is the third differnt shower mirror I've purchased over the years. This one, like the other two, worked great for about four months. After that time it became more and more difficult to keep clear and a month or so later was completly ""fogged"" even without the shower running.For $20 I don't expect much.... However, it would be nice to get at least a year out of these mirrors."
1,Keeps falling off the shower wall,"Mirror keeps falling down. Does not stay on smooth, clean tile. It likes to fall off and crash down to the porcelain tub below in the middle of the night. This mirror is not really fogless either."
3,What I needed,"Mirror is relatively fogless. Not glass, so you don't have to worry about it falling and breaking. It adjusts in magnificaton easily. My only gripe is that there is a little magnification distortion even when at 1:1. Distortion is minimal when close up though, so it works for my purposes."
2,OK if you're looking for a disposable mirror,"I have had several Zadro fogless mirrors so that I can shave while in the shower. The key word here is ""several"". They all became unusable after a few months. The coating used to keep the mirror fog free just does not seem to last. The bottom line is that these things are alright if you know going in that they will need to be replaced in fairly short order. For that reason, buy the cheapest style you can and skip the more expensive ones with radios, lights, etc. built in."
2,you get what you pay for,"It's fairly cheap looking, but it does the job. The razor holders cannot hold my Gillette Mach III Turbo razor, it slips out."
1,This is one horrible mirror,"I have purchased this mirror in 2008. It started fading in the same year. It's now 4th year as I was using it, and I'm finally getting tired of it.Just a horrible quality, and at that time I have paid for it twice as much.Suction cups do not hold the mirror! By the time you are going to shower the next morning or evening, the shower is dry, suction cups do not hold, it falls. It has scarred my wife many times falling during a night. Fortunately it didn't break, but it has chipped.Overall, this is one horrible mirror! Also, it fogs like crazy! Spraying it did not work. The spray just adds a blurry film on it, so you cannot see anything!Do not buy this! Save your money!"
2,Piece of crap,"2 stars... Why? I had this mirror for 2 months, it had begun fogging, so I did what any average person with limited time would do... I threw water at the mirror portion. I guess this was a bad idea, because after doing so, the clock died immediately. No big deal right? Wrong, if that wasn't bad enough, this ""fog less"" mirror started to fog even more. A year has gone by and the mirror fogs instantly. I gave the mirror credit because the suction cups still seem to hold... Sort of. I have a gillette fusion and a disposable razor hanging from it and it tilts to the fusion side. Anyway, I would not by this mirror again and you shouldn't either. ."
3,Fogs alot!,"Zadro Z' Fogless Ultra Mirror - Z500 I used this for five years and it always fogged. i usually put a hot face cloth over it and it clears enough to finish shaving. So i purchased this new one hoping that it would work better....No way, this immediately fogs. So I am still using the hot cloths.But original mirror held up very well in the shower for 5 years, I never had issues like dulling or mold.I am still a huge fan of shaving in the shower, their is a better shave, and I don't leave water splattered all over the vanity."
1,Sun Sign Astrology at its Worst,"Unless your idea of great literature is a 12 question sex quiz in Cosmo magazine, you will obtain almost nothing of intellectual, emotional or spiritual value regarding either sex or astrology by reading this truly ridiculous book. It has a few (very few) funny or astrologically astute observations but the majority of the text is worthless. Psychological and humanistic astrology are wonderful fields for exploring the intricacies of sex and many interesting metaphysical books have been written on the subjects of relationships and intimacy, but, unfortunately, this is not one of them. Every tired old cliche about sun signs is trotted out and discussed in a sophomoric manner--there are even lists of ""unsexy"" members of each zodiacal sign. Seduction by the Stars is presumably meant to be fun and funny in a tongue in cheek kind of way....but...it isn't."
4,"Fun, sexy & educational","This book was fun to read. It is well written and has a very easy to follow guide. My favorite was the emotional sternghts and weaknesses that can be found not only in your self, but in your partner. This book covered all aspects of relationships-desires, fantasies, seduction, romance and how to stay in or leave a relationship. I found this book to be fun and eductional."
3,Send whats shown or indicate what's included,"Ordered this to go along with a hopkins mounting bracket and the pictured connectors weren't included. Fortunately, I had some on hand, but come on. This is the second Hopkins product to show more than you actually get without indicating otherwise. I'm Ok with it as long as I know what I'm getting. Step it up guys."
2,just the pointed ends...,the tongs where hard to grip..so what I did to avoid sending them back.I took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward..like a claw. Now they are excellent.grip great. love the long handle...and heavy duty soft rubber.hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back.
2,Poor design. Wouldn't recommend.,"Saw the other reviews and decided that regardless, I'd try them. They are well designed around the handle with a nice heft of rubber but the thing that makes them almost useless is the design of the metal in contact with the meat. The prongs need to curve in more for starters, but even after I adjusted with a set of pliers, I just couldn't get a good grip on the meat. The concept is excellent......long handles but the execution is just all wrong."
5,Great buy for the money,My father loves to bbq and he lost a good pair of his tongs. I looked on line and found this one and he loves it. He said that they were well made and sturdy enough to pick up a big slab of ribs with out any problems.
1,recon marines dvd,"terrible.... 48 minutes of pre deployment house clearing. the dvd provided no history of a recon marine or what it takes to be one. recon marines are the marine corps. elite warriers and this dvd does them no justice. this dvd appears to be extra footage that did not make it into the military channels "" the marines of alpha company ""."
5,Real Jaws,The crispness the clarity were excellent.The addition of HD almost made it seem as if it was a new movie.
5,Blu-Ray version is awesome!,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. Jaws is my favorite movie of all time and the new Blu-Ray treatment is phenomenal. It is so crystal clear and the colors so true, you feel like you are watching an entirely new movie. I just loved it!"
5,We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat!,"This is one of the most superb films ever made. Spielburg out did himself in this masterpiece. This film held on to drama while still dispensing bone chilling fear. Dreyfus, Shaw and Schieder were at the top of their form. This movie is of the same quality of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Saving Private Ryan. The outtakes and trivia game are wonderful. I recomend this film to you without reservation. This is a film you don't want to miss!"
2,Picture Quality,"It was kind of blurry, and parts of the picture disappeared throughout the movie. The sound quality was also lacking."
2,Jaws,I remember Jaws as a much more vivid movie than the badly faded version that streamed to my HDTV from Amazon. I couldn't bear to watch the whole thing.
4,Nice Edition... But missing some things?,"I was going to rent this movie before I bought it, but I wanted to just by it while I had the chance, and why throw away money on renting it?But there was some things from the 25th Ann. DVD that was missing on this edition, i.e. a trivia game, and some facts about sharks. But I was wondering... Why put this all on two discs while the first edition had even more extras packed on to one disc? Are the creators trying to sell us out?Well, anyways, the movie was good, but Wal-Mart only had the Full Frame edition, so I missed some shots from the movie, but good entertainment overall."
5,This is a young Spielberg Here.,"Hey guys, Here is a young Spielberg here directing Roy Schider. When at the beach at Amity, a shark lurks and feeds on prey when July 4th comes around. I won't tell you what happends and thats probably because you know how it ends. Spielberg directs a great film that was nominated for best picture but lost. A great job by all who are part of this mega hit! One thing, Don't go NEAR THE WATER after seeing this film!"
5,an overlooked scene,"This is an all time favorite of mine. It's just when I use to see it on regular Television or on a Movie Channel, I heard a dubbing sound where Richard Dreyfuss is examining the first victim and when they cut to the part when he lifts her hand (on the DVD) he said ""Now this is what happens..."" (?) and then they cut to another piece of dialogue that doesn't flow with that scene. On Television or on a Movie Channel they would dub in ""And this is what happens when a shark attacks."" I think that's what it said. But I know a dub when I hear one."
5,One of the Best of All Time,"Not just a monster movie, although gory enough, JAWS is a fantastic story and a monument in film-making. Watch it again and pay attention to my favorite parts: 1)you never even see the ""monster"" until 2/3 of the way through the movie...the suspense builds. 2)the cinematography of Chief Brody's view of the little Kitner boy on the raft as the shark pulls him under (an amazing use of the camera as Roy Scheider's view of the water is changed as people pass through the shot) 3)the score (the apex of John William's music arrives when the shark does) 4)Robert Shaw telling the story of the USS Indianapolis, (one of the most moving and telling moments in film ever) this speech was written and rewritten with the final version written by Shaw himself. So that ,in a nutshell, is what makes JAWS one of the best."
5,"Loved the plot, but a little fake.","This movie is great!The plot is great!The charicter's are great!This movie is fantastic.Although there are somefake parts,I loved the movie!The fake scenes are mostlyof the sharks whole body."
4,Jaws,"A Classic. About a man-eating shark that terrorizes beaches during the summer. 3 men go out on a boat to kill the shark. They find out that the shark is a lot bigger then they thought it was. It turns their summer into a deadly nightmare. Jaws even eats one of the 3 men, Quint. While Quint is spitting up blood, one of the others is down in the water after jaws attacked the cage he was in. If you want a good fright but not too harsh, this is a perfect movie."
5,JAWS The Widescreen Edition,Awesome!! I love this movie. Since I was 12 and I saw it in the summer of 1975. The copy I purchased was perfect and I thank you for your prompt service
5,JAWS bites... in a good way,"i thought this movie was A+ when i saw it i sure wasnt scared of the water but i'll tell you waht, i was scared of sharks. once again the master george lucas brings us A+ effects, i wish i could give it 6 stars instead of 5 but thats how life is i guess."
1,This is one of my favorite films of all time.,"Jaws might be one of my favorite films. Really, it's a masterpiece of story telling and as director Steven Spielberg often states, full of happy accidents. So when you see my 1 star review, what you need to understand is my review is not of the film, itself. It's of this edition.The sound mix in this film is awful. Remastered in 5.1 with new effects added. Effects that are just plain bad. Effects that sound like they were taken from free MP3 clips on the web bad. Poorly excuted, muting the effect of the intended scenes, screwing up or altering how well dialogue can be heard and just plain ruining the film. Avoid this DVD version at all costs."
1,"Grat movie, streaming issues with Amazon server","Great movie, terrible streaming. The Amazon server buffered the movie three times in the first 3 minutes and we had to turn it off. Hopefully this was an isolated incident and won't happen again."
2,Dolby Digital or DTS?,"My receiver and DVD player are capable of both Dolby Digital Decoding and DTS. I want to find out which Jaws DVD to purchase, Dolby Digital or DTS? Please help!I am also curious about the Apollo 13 DVD. Same Question, DD or DTS?Thank You - JimmyDuniay@aol.com"
3,Jaws (Widescreen Anniversary Collector's Edition),"I saw this movie 13 times in the theater when I was 13 in 1975ish. I love this movie, the only issue I have with the DVD is they cut some stuff out. There are some continuity problems. When Dreyfuss is looking at the girls remains in the office he holds up her hand and starts to explain what happens when a shark attacks then it seems to cut off and he's talking about something else. Also, when Michael is in the pond and almost gets eaten, they cut out the shark circling him for a while, which is WHY he is in shock. They also cut out some of the dead girl on the beach, I think. Does anyone where I can get the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION on DVD?"
5,A Moby Dick of the 20th Century,"I just saw this again for the 1st time in about ten years now. The good news is that its still a great film. I mean it has it all in a hestitant hero, greedy locals, a lousy Mayor, A Crazy Ship's Captain, a smart alack rich kid expert and a perfect eating machine. All you need more is the popcorn and a couple of cold ones. Well done to all hands!"
2,5.1 a disappointment hope the DTS is better,I was really disappointed in the outtakes and the overall surround sound. 2 outtakes that are not amusing and what surround sound? not sure what the professional rating of 4 on sound was listening to but there were many missed opportunities for effects here. I wasn't expecting great but definitely wasn't expecting so poor. I have the DTS version on order and had rented the 5.1 dvd. I just hope the surround format makes a better transition.
5,"Still Biting, After All These Years","Of the many blockbuster films Steven Spielberg directed, I wonder if this might wind up as his most famous years from now. Like Hitchcock and ""Psycho,"" it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film. For months, people were afraid to go into the ocean after seeing this film. Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace. This is a quick two hours of movie-watching. The music has held up even better than the special-effects. The creepy music whenever the shark is near still can get your adrenaline flowing!I didn't find any of the human beings too appealing. The more I watch this, the more I wish the shark had eaten more of them, like Richard Dreyfuss and Murray Hamilton."
4,Excitement Abounds,"I have all the Jaws movies. Exciting movie to watch and my kind of movies. I also love the background music as that also helps add to the excitement of the movie. It also prepares people for when they go into the oceans to swim. Thank heavens I can't swim. I'd most likely be the one to be attacked by a shark. The acting was very good and the scenery too. The mayor in my opinion, although he was suppose to be on the negative side to make money for the town, was very dislike by me. He had the kind of face profile that even turned me off, although he may be a very nice person. Once scene that I had a problem with was where the great white jumped onto the boat and the guy slid into his mouth. Hard to believe something like that would or could happen."
5,THE ALL-TIME SHOCKER,"I`ve seen this over and over... It simply never outstays its welcome. The thrills are still at potent as in 1975. Yup, they did make sequels and Deep Blue Sea; but it can never be like this....Thanks to the genius of Spielberg, Verna Fields and a GOOD screenplay by Garl Gootlieb and author Peter Bencheley this is both drama, horror and suspense on a high level. JAWS is indeed high art. Scheider, Gary, Duvall, Hamilton and Dreyfuss ALL excell in their roles."
4,problems?,Did anyone have motion problems on this disc? It looks like the speed and the frames per second are jittery at times. You can really see it when viewing the deleted scenes. It could be my player. Any suggestions? Maybe I need an update.
4,NOT Blu-ray,"I had SPECIFICALLY searched for ""Jaws"" in Blu-ray. It appeared on a screen with other Blu-rays. I don't blame the seller. I SHOULD have double checked. Over all, it arrived a day late, but was packeged very securely and my states postal serevice appears to still be using mules...If you're NOT looking for blu-ray (Hint- I gave it to mom) I really recomend this move; nicely packeged and nice dvd case to boot."
3,JAWS Still NOT in Original Theater Print,"If you want a GREAT movie,then you need look no further than JAWS. But if you want the original version as it appeared in the theaters back in 1975, you won't find it here. Even though this edition of JAWS is billed as being from the original 35mm print, it's not. This is still the same version that has been in previous DVD releases and VHS tape releases with the chopped up opening theme music, the chopped up opening credits. When JAWS appeared on TV for the first time, the opening titles and credits had to replaced with smaller versions that would fit the TV screens (they didn't do letterboxing back then). And since that time, JAWS has never been the same. They've always released this TV version. Will we ever see JAWS on DVD or BluRay as it originally appeared in 1975 in the theaters? I'm beginning to wonder of anybody has a copy of that version any more."
1,Why Buy... When You Can Burn...,"Anyone who is tired of the ... crap (thought I was gonna say something else didnt you) that Spielberg does with his DVDs (no commentaries, excessive double-dipping) should crossover to the dark side - burn the hell out of him and his company by burning his movies...burn Spielberg burn (just had to say it one more time.)"
1,I'm sorry...,"I wanted to like this film. Really, I did. But there's not a scary frame in the film. The suspense falls flat, the dialogue is ugh, the characters to me were nothing more than fish food, and it's vastly overrated. I wanted SO much to have a GREAT time watching this film, but I just couldn't. I apologize, but I can't lie. I hated this movie."
2,Disc Doesn't Work,Just received Jaws Blu Ray...popped it in my Oppo 93...and goes to black..Can't return it because it didn't come with a packing slip/receipt :(
1,No digital copy,The BluRay claims to come with a digital copy for iTunes. It only has an UltraViolet code. There is no iTunes code. Lame.
1,You've got to be kidding......,"This is by far the most ridiculous cash-in double dip there is. There is actually a clown out there who said in another review that he bought this for the mono feature. That is the most redeeming thing about this dvd????????????????? MONO!!???? Some people seriously need to get a life. I feel sorry for all the suckers that ""need"" to own this... 2 FANGS WAY DOWN!!! Every bit of this release couldh've been released before. All the material came from the laser disc which has been around for years.5 stars for the movie...0 stars for the double dip. They could have put commentary, retrospective documentaries, looking back interviews with cast and crew, but we get NOTHING!!! Guess there saving that for the eventual ""ULTIMATE EDITION"" to grab some more of your cash. Save your money please and don't listen to these CULT reviewers who are brainwashed!"
1,"Jaws Anniversary Collector's Edition a ""Big Disappointment""",Jaws is one of my favorite movies . I regret purchasing this DVD movie addition. The movie is not complete as I saw it originally at the movies and also on TV years ago. The deleted scenes are in the original full lenth movie. Why call this a collectors addition and take out the original scenes and then say they are bonus materials.This is a edited movie version and not the original. This is not a collectors addition. Just a big disappointment.
1,Jaws (the movie) Problem with receiving DVD,I have not received the DVD that I ordered instead I received a link to watch the movie through my computer. I will not do this since it will not give you the impact of watching on a large screen. This is a mistake and I have been unable to talk to a live person to correct the problem. Amazon is getting out of touch to handle a change like this so I will wait for my Credit Card bill to contest the charge so I can get somebody's attention. JOS
5,"A classic action film filled with panic, blood, and sharks!","""Jaws"" is without a doubt the greatest shark movie ever made and one of the very few of its kind out there. Unlike that stupid shark movie that came out last summer, ""Deep Blue Sea"" or whatever the hell it's called, ""Jaws"" is filled with plenty of bites that will delight blood-induced audiences and a good load of excellent acting. Starring paranoid Roy Schnieder, nerdy Richard Dreyfuss, and, in one of the best film performances in history- Robert Shaw- and backed with a chilling Academy Award-winning score, ""Jaws"" is a must see in my family. But all of the above isn't what makes this film a treasure in my family- its' because my grandfather, musician Oscar Meza, played the infamous ""Jaws"" theme on the bass. Seeing this movie makes our family proud of him. But anyway, ""Jaws"" is a classic action film that should be seen by audiences everywhere!"
4,"scare me, please","Although filled with tons misinformation about the shark, this movie scared the bejeezus out of me when I was a kid. It's still terrifying to me today, but I still watch it over and over."
2,DVD sounds are terrible,"I got this DVD thinking that it would be phenomenal given the underwater sounds and all. Sorry all, but I refuse to buy something that I have to wait until chapter 19 to hear some great sound effects that last a second. My advice is this. If you want to get this movie on DVD because you are done watching VHS tapes, fine. But do not buy this if you want to hear a great sound format. Also, the DTS version is a joke. I don't know if it was just the one DVD that I happened to buy, but it wouldn't allow you to choose the DTS format at all. Why pay extra for DTS if you can't even use it? My spouse and I laughed while watching it due to that there were maybe 4 times that you heard the ""shark coming sound effect"" on the rear speakers, and even then it sounded so mono. Save your money and don't buy this one."
4,A favorite at my house.,"Jaws is not really a favorite of mine, I first saw it on a date that didn't go all that well, and I was too angry too get the jump factor that the rest of the audience did. However, my family will all watch Jaws over and over at least once a year, so go figure.My cool anecdote about Jaws is from a couple of weeks after it came out, I was skin diving near Newport Beach, and as we swam out from shore, the sea weed was swaying in the water, my friend and I both looked at each other at the same time and through our snorkels, we sang ""Doo, doo, doo-doo"" That day they caught a baby Great White between where we were and Catalina Island, the next day a world record Great White off of Catalina. It did keep us out of the water the rest of the week!So here's the deal, this is a scary movie, but don't look too close at the special effects, as they are pretty cheesy by today's standards, and on a side note, Myth Busters tried to re- create the Blow Up scene... Myth busted!"
5,Amazing colors,Bought this for my wife for a Christmas present and we watched it last night. All I can say is WOW! The colors are extremely vibrant and in your face gorgeous! We watched the Blu-ray only so far and haven't watched any of the extras but I have to say that watching it on Blu-ray was like watching Jaws for the first time.
4,The shark is working great in Blu-ray,"I saw Jaws when it first came out in the 70s. I was but a schoolboy, and after that day, I never stopped drawing sharks on every piece of paper I could find. It's great to see one of my most loved films restored beautifully on Blu-ray. I can finally see the patterns and the textures on Mayor Larry's jacket, the sun-beaten craggly features on Quint's face, and all the details on Bruce the shark. I wonder how the young generation today, those who grew up with only CGI, will take to Bruce and this film."
5,AWESOME Movie,"What a great movie! I realized that I had never seen this movie and watched it with friends who have seen it multiple times! It's a great movie to watch for the first time or the 10th! A classic, for sure!!!"
5,A classic.,"Very happy with my purchase. I have an old copy of the VHS version and forgot how brilliant the cinematography was until I played the newley mastered DVD verson. Great color, sharp images and wonderful sound! This a must have for any serious collector..."
5,Jaws is one killer shark.,"Ok, thinking this movie was made in 1975 and I did not have very high hopes for it, I rented anyways because I love the work of Director Steven Speilburgh. I have throughly enjoyed this movie time after time, in fact, I am watching it right now! This is one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion. I STRONGLY suggest for ANYBODY, except children under about 7, to watch this movie. DVD:WONDERFUL VHS:WONDERFUL PERIOD."
2,JAWS ANNIVERSARY - WHERE IS THE DTS?,"The Image quality is magnificant, but, adding to the review by ""englishonly"", who stated ""there was very little activity in the rear speakers"" consider this sound may be no more than Dolby Digital, and might have more activity on the Pro-logic setting. Are the extras in DTS and not the film? The advertising doesn't indicate that. WHERE IS THE DTS? My DVD player tells how many channels are outputing and the Decoder displays that info (2 channel). DTS won't activate, and on the same exact setup, Saving Ryan indicates DTS and rattles the rafters. Buy this for picture quality,YES. Buying for DTS?, better find out first. I hope it is my mistake and have not BEEN RIPPED OFF?"
3,Basic Thriller,"This movie is a good thriller. It staggers the imagination as far as how well it has succeeded. I am in agreement with Robert Shaw, the British actor who played Quint (which Amazon has amazingly left out of the actors listed for the film). Shaw didn't believe the film would do well, so he took a flat fee for his role, rather than the percentage he was initially offered. A mistake, in hindsight. However, I agree with his initial instinct. This film is fun, but flatter than a pancake. The most interesting part of the movie is the character Quint, which, by the way, Shaw added to by creating interesting lines for his character. Shaw was not just a great actor, but a very fine writer as well. Here's to the memory of Robert Shaw--you are greatly missed, Robert!"
5,ONE OF SPIELBERG'S BEST!!,"DA-DA.DA-DA.DA-DA....& JAWS SURFACES AS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME!AND GUESS WHAT,KIDS! IT'S NOT AS SCARY AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS!! THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!! STUPID ""ONE FLEW OVER THE COOKOO'S NEST WAS BEST BEST PICTURE INSTEAD 'O' THIS.I HAVE FIRST 3 JAWS FILMS (THEY'RE MINE) BUT THIS ONE STANDS OUT BEST!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
4,Like I'd Never Seen it Before,"I bought this DVD without seeing or hearing anything about it....just an impulse buy. I am very glad that I did. I hadn't seen the movie in a long time, and thought I pretty much remembered it all. Upon watching it, however, I was surprised by how many times i was startled...almost as if I'd never seen it before. It truly made me appreciate how far ahead of its time and how well done this movie was. Highly recommend it to anyone....even if you've seen it 100 times!"
3,Great Movie! Substandard VHS Package...,"Not much more needs to be said about JAWS, perhaps Spielberg's best action film of all time. I love this movie; that's why I'm so disappointed that Universal is only offering the nifty Anniversary edition in Pan and Scan. Where is the widescreen tape version? I know that the DVD is widescreen, but I buy movies for the video store I work at, and many of our customers don't have DVD yet. Universal has even taken the old widescreen VHS version off the market. This is a shame, because this movie really deserves the widescreen treatment. Rent and Enjoy the film and the cool extras, but wait to buy a widescreen version when it comes along."
3,Okay.,"This is one of my favorite movies, but I'm rating it as a horror film. It was scary when it came out, the reason it isn't scary now, is because that the special effects for the shark are really bad! This needs a remake! Parts that could have been scary made me laugh because of the special effects."
5,"Truely, the best motion picture - ever","Jaws is a motion picture that was well ahead of it's time. The special effects displayed in this movie were not computer generated, but generated from the point of view of realism. In 1975 they still thought they could TRAIN a shark, and not create one. And yet, in cinematic history, the biggest money maker of 1975, there is a man made, larger than life sized shark - caught on film in the movie Jaws. A movie that went way over schedule, and way over budget,and yet was produced and emptied the beaches for the summer. Not a mindless horror movie, but an intricate psychological analysis of people and their environment. Not a movie of gore - but suspense and action! This movie, can never be replaced or topped. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER JAWS. Thanks to Benchley, Zanuck, Brown, Spielberg, Fields, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss,Gary, Hamilton, Gottlieb, Mattey, Bruce, and ALL OTHERS INVOLVED- THANK YOU!"
1,"For first timers,yeh,but for Jaws fans.......NO!!!!!!","Great for first timers,but for Jaws fans.....NO!!!!!!!!........WE ALREADY HAVE IT ON THE PREVIOUS 100 DVDS AND VHS`S YOU`VE REALEASED OF IT!!!!!!!Why do they keep realeasing different kins of dvds of this movie?All the Jaws fans already have it!It all started with the regular vhs tape when it was realeased after the film came to theaters....then guess what?......LETTER BOX VHS,LETTERBOX DVD,25TH ANNIVERSARY VHS TAPE,25TH ANNIVERSARY DVD,AND NOW THIS!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!Why don`t they just make a Jaws 5?That would be extremely better!Whewwwwwww...................(Sorry I yelled,I couldn`t help it)"
1,Tentacles Is Better... and not shoved down your throat!,"Lord above save us from Steven Spielberg films!!! Sure I admit Jaws was groundbreaking in the 70's. Do we really need this outdated and overhyped film pumped into our TV sets every weekend from endless showings on TNT, TBS, TCM, and AMC? Spielberg is an inflated ego-head who stopped any Jaws rip- off- type films from being released in the US. He should be glad anyone was inspired by his Hollywood tripe. Spielberg I think is the real ""King of the World."" Don't waste your money to buy this when you can tape it for free on any weekend!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring!!!","I can't understand why JAWS continously pops up on 'Greatest Horror Movie'lists and critiques...it is NOT great, NOT a horror (more like horrible),and while it IS a movie, it's just not all that good to me. I guess most people like it because it has a lot of names involved with it. Maybe I'm biased because I am not a swimmer and have never been into water sports, but I just find it extremely boring after the first attack or two. There are far better movies as far as I am concerned...JAWS is one of my least favorite films, never liked it even as a kid."
1,A classic?,"Come on. Why do people consider this a classic? Why do people consider this good?I've watched it so many times, trying to find a redeeming quality SOMEWHERE in it, but I just can't! And it frustrates me how people proclaim it a great movie and a classic, and it's a terrible movie! Of course, I realize this is just my opinion, and I'm not masquerading it as anything more, but come on, now. Why is it so great? Why is it so suspenseful? I just don't get it.At least 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' beat it for Best Picture."
1,Please be honest with yourselves,"This review is for the 5 star reviewers. Let's face it, this is not a worthy double-dip and you know it!!! NO VIDEO UPGRADE, NO COMMENTARY WHATSOEVER (We know spielberg doesn't do them buy not even from an actor of the movie), ALL WE GET IS AN EXTRA 45 MINUTES OF A DOCUMENTARY THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR TEN YEARS AND WAS AVAILABLE WHEN THE ORIGINAL DISC WAS MADE! The 5 Star reviewers must be either people who work for the studio or completely in DENIAL! Enough is enough with this re-release tactic!!!! They try to make you buy the same movie over and over again!"
1,A Huge Dissapointment!,"I was so dissapointed by this dvd when I got it!I mean they added a few minutes to the featurette, put a couple of deleted scenes on them,put some crappy interview with Steven Spielberg & took out the trailer!I want my $ back!they even kept the same menus!Waste of time & $!"
1,$84.95 are you serious?,1 of 0 Stars to Anchor*Media for there outrages overpricing 5 Stars for the film and Digibook its self. I love Jaws but to pay $84.95 for a bluray digibook That's just Highway Robbery. $25.95 would have been the right price.
2,Not that great,"This dvd was listed under Blue Ray movies, it wasn't, it played very grainy on my new player..so I sent it back, haven't been reimbursed as yet..but I know I will"
2,If you look you can see many mistakes!,"When I first saw the movie I was about ready to jump out of my skin it was so scary. When I look at this site call, Imdb.com, I look at he goofs, on Jaws, and saw that there were more than 20!!! The one that you can see easily, is where that shark attacks that guy in the boat. When he falls into the water he is clearly seen NOT wearing shoes. But when the shark tears of his leg, it HAS a shoe on it. Another easy on to spot was at the starting at of the movie. When Chrisy (I don't know how to spell her name) is tugged by the shark, her mouth doesn't match the screams she makes. The backround changes too!I'm not saying that Steven Speilberg's first hit was bad, I just think that it could some clean up.Thanks For Reading-Jesse"
5,a MONSTER hit of a movie in every way.,"Arguably the most talked about movie of its era or any other era. Put Speielberg on the map 3 years before his buddy George Lucas joined him in the history books with a little flick called Star Wars.All these years later, we still watch this master piece."
4,Still a Classic!,"The story plot is simple. See Shark, See Shark terrorize a small coastal town, see people die, see people kill shark! There you have the entire story in four declarative statements. Although I am one of the ones that was inspired to go to college and get a biology degree because of the salty shark researcher in the movie, I cannot get passed the cheesy mechanics of ""Bruce"" the shark Still the director did a supurb job at making us ""WAIT FOR IT"" type scenes that still excites us today. Although I have become accustomed to 21st century techniques in Hollywood, this story will be forever a classic. (But if truth be known, I liked the book better~)"
4,I never thought I could watch this movie again!,"Not to long ago, I tried seeing Jaws again since I was a child and I liked the movie to my surprise.As a child, I saw one little part of Jaws and was completely terrified. This time, I wasn't scared from it at all.I recommend this movie for anyone who likes Spielberg films and isn't afraid of watching a ocean movie."
5,Great all time classic!!!,"Even though the imagery is nothing like today's movies, this movie will still put a fright in you. Just a great all time classic movie!!!"
4,Classic,Jaws is and was one of the great classic Movies that made movies fun to watch. Kids loved it but ....i dont like the profanity. Had to mute out the obscenity. No kids under 13 for this movie.
5,Perfect,"Cinematography, music, acting are all superb.The movie is a timeless classic and the 100th anniversary Blu-Ray makes it even better."
5,Superbly acted and directed action/adventure classic,"""Jaws"" is a tremendously entertaining action/adventure film. It's not really a horror film although it contains horror elements. Director Spielberg draws superlative performances from his main characters played by Robert Shaw (old sea dog), Roy Scheider (local police chief), and Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and it's their interplay which is particularly memorable. Brilliantly directed and conceived by Spielberg and featuring the iconic John Willams theme - this is a film classic. Don't bother with any of the sequels."
4,classic remastered,"all time favourite classic , remastered in pure clean sharp digital format for the HD tv, just too sweet to describe the quality, watch jaws like never before!!!"
4,Great Movie,"The movie is a classic, but the high def didnt seem to me to be all that great, overall four stars"
2,remastered? are you sure?,"the night time scenes looked like crap on the re release. i mean come on, with all the technology out there to fake the moon landing, this is the best you can do???? otherwise it was good and worth saving what local retailers charge."
5,Never Get Tired Of This,"I picked this disc up because I only had the Full Screen DVD. This is a film that needs to be Widescreen or Letterbox. The special features are fantastic. If you don't own this, get it. Hey, it's JAWS..one of the best films ever made. Period."
5,A great film with only one problem,"This movie did not have too very many special effects, true. But, do you really want realism or special effects, I want realism. If you are in a boat, do you ever really get a good look at a shark, probably not. As a parallel, 2001 is actually set around Saturn, but the rings would severely date the film, so Jupiter was chosen; if Jaws was full of special effects the film would a) look like any number of monster films, and b) look dated today. In 2001, 26 years later, Jaws packs as much punch as it did in 1975. Is Jaws really about a community versus a shark, yes; but, it is also about a man torn between what's right and what's politically desirable. Honestly, it is pure 1970s in execution, but in message it is fresh even today. This is a movie you have to make your own mind up about, rent it one night, if you like it buy it."
4,Don't Be Scared!,"JAWS is a terrifying movie (At the beginning), but begins to wind down at about the second scene. This movie is full of suspence and action. Steven Sbielberg is a director who will bring terror with action and adventure anytime, like JAWS. I loved this film and so will you!This is a great film to watch at sleepovers! I really recommend it! BUY THIS FILM ON 'DVD' OR 'VHS'!"
5,Movie and DVD Review.,"""Jaws"" is one of the best 70's movies ever made! The film deals with the police chief (Roy Scheider), an oceanographer (Richard Dreyfuss), and a fisherman (Robert Shaw) who were riding on the boat to find, hunt down, and kill the giant shark that was killing people who were swimming at the beach in Amity Island. The 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD is great! The picture and sound quality are outstanding. The extras are wonderful including the ""Making Of Jaws"", the deleted scenes, and the outtakes. If you haven't seen ""Jaws"", what's wrong with you? See it right away! It's excellent!"
4,my fear will go on,"This was the first scary movie I saw with my dad. I was 11, a beach bunny already, and after I saw the movie, I went home and when dinner was served, I threw up my spinach. It was the scene where the captain gets eaten. I'm 35 now, and only four years ago saw it for the second time. I'm convinced even now that when I die, it will be by shark attack. But I love the movie. I still love the beach, and I even love sharks. I never miss shark week on Discovery and they are the animals I most love to watch at the Moody Aquarium. The movie scared me to death, and yet the actors had me watching between my fingers. I felt angry when the mother smacked the sheriff, but can sympathize being a mom myself. It's a roller coaster ride, and I love every hill and drop of it. I still, however, either close my eyes (tight) or leave the room when Shaw's demise approach."
5,A classic,"I seems silly to even rate a movie that is so widely known. That being said, somehow I've never seen it until I bought it on instant streaming. It was great! The character and plot development were really well done, and the closing action was really drawn out, but in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
4,Jaws Remembered,"Absolutely one of the very best in shark drama, pure classic, audiences will love and also remember this one for a very long time to come, depite it's compititions."
5,Must own,Great blu ray transfer. This film never looked better. New documentary the shark is working is a great addition. I highly reccomend picking up this blu.
5,A classic,Saw this movie in the theater when it came out and I can honestly say I love this version. The extras on the Blu-ray are worth getting alone. A must buy!!!!
4,Jaws on Blu-Ray,"This is a great copy - an excellent reproduction onto Blu-Ray. Movie is of course awesome and for fans, I would recommend picking up this copy."
5,"""Some bad hat Harry""","I love this movie! Jaws has it all, sure it's scary, but it is very funny, sympathetic, exciting too.It also takes place on and in real water in a real ocean.Something sorely missing in todays aquatic films.The charecters are memorable, and developed and perfectly cast.If Jaws were made today,Denise Richards would be Hooper, George Clooney would be Brody, and Bruce Willis would be Quint!The shark would be CGI and all of its magic would be lost.Jaws is the real deal."
5,Terror at its best,"This movie 30 years later is the BEST ocean thriller ever made. I have watched it so many times I know every line and I can watch it again and again. It is fun to watch the extras and deleted scenes, it gives you a sense of the making of this movie, and how innovative it was for the mid 70's!"
5,Its still a great film,I had this given to me for Christmas. I have seen all the films before and never thought I would own a copy. But it is a classic. With the recent sad news about the death of Roy Scheider it makes it more applealing. The quality of the DVD is far better than we had on VHS.The John Williams music is still as chilling as ever.
2,Bait and Switch...two fangs down!,"Pardon the pun, but I am tired of the bait and switch moves by film distributors when it comes to DVD releases. You buy the 25th anniversary disc and low and behold, they release a 30 year version, with nary a tempting extra. Those reviews that give this a 5 star or close to it, you're suckers, all of ya! This release hardly has anything the 25 year version didn't. Maybe a longer featurette. And then there will be the 35 year version, with one extra deleted scene, I bet ya. Anyway, save your money, buy the 25 year unless you can't find it. And by the way, I give the movie itself 5 stars for sure!"
2,"Spielberg and Universal do it again...that is, RIP YOU OFF!","Alright, if you've never got around to adding Jaws to your dvd collection then now is as good a time as any with this edition. But if you shelled out for the ""25th Anniversary"" disc, then STAY AWAY from this scam. It comes with the unabridged documentary that was found on laser. But does it have a commentary track? Are you kidding? What else is Universal and $pielberg going to lure you into buying this again when its released on HDVD? These people didn't even see fit to remaster the print with the latest digital technology. This is a shameful, worthless edition. Univeral / $pielberg deserve nothing less than your enmity and contempt for failing dvddom AGAIN."
4,So-So Blu-Ray,"For whoever is interested, the Blu-ray version of ""Jaws"" is only a marginal improvement (visually) over the regular DVD. The movie itself is a solid 5 Star (one of the all-time greats) but a spectacular Blu-ray (Hi-Def) transfer has yet to come."
3,This movie's okay,Big bad killer shark starts chomping on anybody dumb enough to swim by and the people who run the beach are afraid to call summer fun off. Very stylish and fun until the 3 guys get on the boat and try to hunt down the shark and kill him or her. Those parts are VERY boring! Pepsi and Pizza
3,The Shark Heard Round The World,"""Chomp"" there goes my foot!(laughs)...But seriously folks, this Jaws fellow is one bastard you don't wanna meet in a dark alley, if you know what I mean! This movie flat out scared the (Bleep!) out of me! I read where it took nearly a year to train the shark for all his sequences, which is amazing considering this was filmed in the early seventies. Overall, this movie rocks totally and I can't recommend it any higher."
5,jawsmovie review,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is enjoyable to watch and it never once is boring. The acting is great, and yes I know this movie is a kind of old and the shark does look a little fake, but who cares. One of the funnest movies to watch."
5,Gorgeous bluray!,"I just bought the bluray today and just finished watching the entire movie. Let me just tell you that the picture and sound quality are absolutely amazing! I guess we can't please the ones that gave it just one star, but it is what it is! You simply can't go wrong with this movie! I saw it again after many years and I was very impressed, need I say more!?"
3,This isn't Scary,"This isn't scary, it's down right hystarical! SS did a great job with this movie, but the shark still, and always will look fake. It's time for a remake. Great soundtrack. I can't believe this made people scared to go swimming at the beach, I can't see how. Someone needs to explain that to me."
2,Okay...Just a bit overrated...,"Okay, okay...Jaws, in my opinion, is an okay movie. The plot is fairly interesting, but I've seen a lot of movies and shows about giant animals wreaking havoc so...yeah. ^^;But the reason I dislike this movie is because I'm a shark fan. I adore sharks and just about any other animal that can kill you...*sweatdropps*...Yeah. So the serious ""shark bashing"" I saw in his movie sort of made me mad. ^^ Especially since great white sharks are one of my favorite animals.And everyone said, ""Shark attack! Get out of the water!"" way too much...x.x...Pros ~Interesting plotThe shark looked pretty neatCons ~Everyone said ""Shark attack! Get out of the water!"" too muchWay too much shark bashing..."
2,shark is scary - people get eaten....I hide my eyes,"After I watch the JAW movie, I not go into water-no.The big shark scared methe shark not git me, but i not go into the water after seeing the shark in movie waterpeople died and screemed - i heard a man yell, AIEEEEEEEEE and get eaten by the shark, well, i not go in the water again but pools are okay...I look before i go in....Like the acting...very good...actor named Roy and Roburt Shaw were good, and so was man called HooopI like to see the men hunt the shark...and the music is scareeeDA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DANow i buy JAW 2 ...scary too..more scary...more people go and get eaten...shark likes to eats people and eat meatSharks are dangeros and eat peeple. Swim in pools or in lakes . Sharks can swim fast and chase boats..I like sharks but stay away from Atlantic OshunWatch movie called JAW.....i gived 2 thumb up"
2,Jaws=Overrated.,"Steven Spielberg's mega-hit Jaws (1975) is in my opinion, overrated. The film isn't ""heart-pounding"" or anything like that. The shark looks so fake, and the whole film is just unrealistic. The acting is good, I'll admit, but other than that, there's not much but hype."
5,Best Shark movie!,This Is A Classic. Although I Don't know why this was voted most scariest movie. Send Exorcist on Second. Still This movie Is Perfect for People Who like Shark Attacks and Blood! iT'S A GREAT MOVIE. IS THAT HELPFUL ENUFF?!
5,My life revolves around Jaws,"This is probobly one of my favorite movies of all time. Titanic doesn't hold a candle next to this wonderful movie! My friends and I are still scared of the ocean, and will be for ever more! At my old school, I was known as ""Jaws girl"", and everyone got a big shark in their yearbook. I love movies, but this is one of the best, maybe better than Casablanca or Vertigo. Jaws is almost a legend, and if you evr go into my room, you will come out knwing exactly everything you ever wanted to know or see written, drawn, reviewed,etc. about the best movie in the world: Jaws"
5,Jaws,"Indeed a classic! This started the series of great films that came from Steven Speilberg. Plot, action, suspense and thrills .. this flim has them in abundance. Get your popcorn ready and enjoy!"
5,A great classic!,"JAWS is a movie i used to watch with my dad a lot.I used to be scared of it,but i now think it is a great movie to watch.I really recommend this movie!"
5,"""You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat!""",What can I say? I'm speechless! No doubt one of the top 10 greatest movies of all time! I still till this day will not go in the ocean. Highly recommended!
4,"HD? Well, mostly.","Overall I was impressed with the effort they put into enhancing the detail and coloring of the film. I mean, for a 37 year old movie, they did a great job! Except for one scene, and it's not even a real important scene, but it actually looks worse on the Blu-ray than it did on DVD. It's the scene where Brody, Lorraine, and Hooper are sitting in Brody's dining room talking about the shark and drinking wine. Looks pretty rough. Other than that, I'm very excited that this was finally released on Blu-ray."
3,You get what you pay for,"Short version: meh.Long version: I love Y peelers and was hoping to find something as sharp as what my mother has. This isn't it.It is worth $8.00 to skip out on the junk peelers sold in the grocery store, but this is hardly the peeler of one's dreams."
3,Average,This peeler is just average. The handle feels OK in the hand but the peeling blade isn't the best. Something about how the blade is held in the handle that doesn't make for effective peeling.
5,Works great!,I love my new OXO Good Grips Y Peeler. It is definitelty comfortable to hold and the blades on the peeler are nice and sharp. The blade removes a nice thin peel. I have had other peelers that remove too much of the good part of the fruit or veggie. I highly recommend buying this product.
2,It was great at the beginning,I've been using this peeler for about 2.5 months. At the beginning it was the greatest peeler I've ever owned. I mean I could peel through veggie skins like butter but within a couple of months the peeler stopped becoming so sharp. Now I have a hard time peeling through ginger skins. This peeler was mostly use for potatoes and sometimes gingers. I didn't peel anything hard with it but it still lost it's sharpness.
4,Good Writing Lasts,"I'm glad Amazon is making available classic literature. I love Willa Cather's writing and liked O! Pioneers very much, the sense of space, the characters, which were all very believable. I wasn't wild about the ending but I'm not much into romance. My favorite book of hers is Death Comes for the Archbishop which I recommend to anyone who has an affinity to the southwest, or would like to visit without leaving the comfort of your own home."
3,important historical novel,"As much as the novel has meaning to me from a family history level,I can't be uncritical of the resultwhich is mostly a pretty slow and pretty uninteresting plot.The prose and descriptive text is very beautiful and the poetry of theresult is clear. The life on the farm is not the most interestingor full of adventure, but the people who leave the Nebraska townseem to disappear from the plot ( Carl goes to Alaska during the gold rush there and we just get side comments!).The book is a woman's story about the concerns of women.I liked it, but mostly because my mother's people are from Nebraska."
3,This book was semi-inspiring.,"This book was okay. I liked parts of it but I feel like it was nothing more than another version of Little House on the Parire. The best parts of the book were the one about Marie, the little French girl."
3,Only Pretty-Good,"O Pioneers by Willa Cather is a descent read. It is an interesting story about how a women survives because of her love of the land. I liked the characters pretty well, and I really do enjoy Willa Cather's style of writing. I just do not think that this was her best novel or that it reached its potential. This novel was supposed to be about how the land held Alexandra and how she survived for and with it. Cather seemed to get off of her thesis, though. She tells page after page of the love affair between Marie and Emil and gets of topic. She could have developed Alexandra's relationships more thoroughly. Some technical aspects or the novel become bothersome, also. Some of the dialogue seems false and the verb tense Cather writes in switches at places in the novel. Overall, the novel is worth reading, but it would be better to read her other works like My Antonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop.p.s. I did like that Cather acknowledged Sarah Orne Jewett with the dedication."
1,O Please tell me this book is NOT considered a classic!,"The book starts off great, with a warmth and vividness that makes one care about the characters. Unfortunately, that brief spark of brilliance fades all too quickly. We soon find ourselves mired in a muck of endless drivel. Early on, a time leap propels us 16 years forward where we lose a sense for who the characters are. From that point on, the author gives us no more than a two-dimensional portrait of our heroine and her family. In depth descriptions are reserved for the landscapes and boring events, instead of for the emotions that motive the main characters. Inexplicably, some of the characters turn into brooding morons with (seemingly) no redeeming qualities. This work left much to be desired. Read ""O Pioneers"" only if you want to see how a great start means...absolutely nothing! For more enjoyable reading try authors like Lucy Maud Montgomery, Henry James, or Jane Austen...you'll be glad you did!"
1,Not available.,I have tried more than once to order this title on my Kindle. It never arrives. Hard to review a book you can't get a hold of.
5,It stunk!!! Don't take the time to read it!!!,i thought that the book would of been about some Pioners but It ended up totally different!!!!!! Like wehn Frank kills Emil and Maria!!!! Thats totally un cool!!!!!!
2,Boooorrrrinnng!,"This book was extremely boring. If you enjoy reading descriptions of land and people then you would love this book. There is only one high point in the book, and after I read it, i didnt want to finish reading the book. Use your best judgement"
1,A Long Summer,Over the summer I had to read this book as part of a school assignment. This book was very long even though it contains only 208 pages. Willa Cather over explains many details in this book. I would reccomend this book to absolutely no one.
1,This is the worst book that I ever had to read.,"Attention all readers, this is a general alert. If you come in contact with this book, it must be destroyed immediately! It may be contaminated by a rare soul-sucking virus that causes students who are forced to read it to loose all willpower to go on caring about 10th grade english class."
5,realistic & poignant,"This is one of the few books I have reread! Cather's rich characterizations & lush descriptions of the prairie make this a worthwhile read. I fell in love w/ Alexandra, Emil & Marie and would recommend this to anyone ... even if they don't usually read stories about the frontier."
3,"The book was neither fantastic or horrible, it was good.","I am not a large fan of Willa Cather's works, but she is a fairly good writer. The book's title gives the impression of excitment where in reality it is somewhat of a romance novel. I would recomend it to those who enjoy reading about family hardships or ""forbiden loves."""
5,Cather Rocks,"There seems to be a lot of reader criticism of Cather as a product of her time...well, she WAS a product of her time! How can you escape that, writer or not? But what is so special about Cather is the vividness of her imagery; the details she captures, both from the landscape and in conversation, are amazing. There are very few authors, alive or dead, with such style, control, and mastery of nuance."
4,O Pioneer,"Heartwarming, nostalgic, a chapter from American's past; a welcome relief from today's literature which, in the name or realism, uses t and its use of the worst that humans can be - in order to sell!!"
3,Not Cather's best.,"The most outstanding part of this book is its description of the land in rural south central Nebraska. This book is very handy in that regard. Cather makes the land and its harsh realities a vital part of the novel. The characters of Alexandra and Frank Shabata are really the only others to impress.Carl Lindstrom is a moocher who only wants something for nothing.Lou and Oscar are basically backwards thinking stubborn farmers.Emil is a moocher and a lecher and wants his sister to always pay his way.Marie is a sex-kitten who ends up getting killed.Essentially, Alexandra is the only real complex character in the book, with the land. It is not a bad story, but My Antonia and Death Comes for the Archbishop are much better novels.As an entry to Cather this book is fine, but the other two above are better novels by far."
3,"Cather's work is somewhat slow, yet heartwarming.","O Pioneers! is basically a book of what some call technicalities. Alexandra, who is in charge of the Bergson family, really seems to imply that she is only doing all the things for her family, but yet I see it as an escape for herself. She becomes this way when Carl says he is leaving. Alexandra does not want to be alone, therefore she tells her family about buying more land in other towns to make money, when really I believe she is looking for someone to compress her loneliness and satisfy her desires."
5,I hate Pioneer stories........,....but I can't deny that this was a good book! I usually like stories that spend time describing someONE rather than someTHING. Yet I loved to read this story despite Cather's description of the land. She wrote it so beautifully that I elt like those parts were poetry. Highly recommended!!
5,Living Words,"Sometimes, you open a book and the from the first few pages, you forget you are reading words and feel the story unfold in your mind's eye and heart. I suppose this is very personal - some authors 'voice' resonates with some readers, some don't, but from the very first pages, O Pioneers! did with me.This is one of the most vivid depictions of life on the prairie that goes beyond the simple cliches of 'country folk'. I have never read a better depiction of the feeling youthful love and vigor than in this work. I feel strange writing this, but after I read it, I had a sense of peace, as if I had lived through the story.side note: I understand this book is often assigned for fiction in High School (it wasn't with me) its a shame to think of students trudging through such a beautiful book because its an 'assignment'."
3,"Beautiful, but a bit sluggish","I have to give this classic a mixed review. The tone, for the most part, was sweet and wistful, but the action was almost painfully slow. It moved, in fact, something like the seasons of the year, which along with the land, were characters in this play. The story of immigrant Nebraskan farmers of the early 20th century is mostly about how they lived rather than things that happened, and it takes about about three-quarters of the book before the action finally picks up a little.I liked Willa Cather's eloquent and flowing style and the coloring of the land and its people. It reminded me a bit of an old, tinted, softly glowing, romantic movie of maybe 50 years ago. I also liked her animation of the land and weather, although I was bothered a little by its pantheistic flavor; the land, in fact, was the most animated character of the book.In short, if you like a journey better than its destination, this is not a bad book. For myself, I need both journey and destination."
4,The Land They Belong To Is Grand,"O Pioneers is a very fine tale. Willa Cather's descriptions of the farm lands and countryside are wonderful. This story centers on a very strong woman , Alexandra who loved her land. The only part of the story that I found disturbing was Alexandra's view that the tragedy that took place at the end was Marie's fault. Willa Cather was a head of her time in her portrayl of women characters but, in Marie's case her views appear to be those of her time. I liked this story very much."
5,Cather's Second Best!,"""O Pioneers"" is not ""My Antonia"", but it's pretty close. Anything that Willa Cather has written is great and you without a doubt want to add this one to your library."
4,mamma,"My son doesnt say much but I am happy with pricing since I order for him. I try to save as much as possible, College is getting to be so much money Thanks"
5,Great BOOK,Needed to read it for my American Literature class. Glad I did. It was a breath of fresh air. Much different than other popular books
1,Talky & Boring,"O Pioneers! is talky, talky, talky and boring, boring, boring. No wonder high school students hate it. I am far past high school, but I could not get through it, either. Cather seems to write chapters for the sake of cranking out pages, but many chapters go nowhere and lead to nothing. Like one chapter where she goes with her brothers to visit a strange Russian named Ivar who has peculiar ideas on how to raise pigs. Does she go into the hog butchering business? Or big time hog farming? Does she even follow his advice? No. Nothing happens and the hogs don't come up again. And her endless descriptions of the scenery are enough to make me wish she got stranded in the Gobi Desert. She just can't stop with the scenery, which makes up a good half of the book. Maybe she should have been a painter."
3,A Good Read,"This book is about a girl named Alexandra's struggle to support her family and take care of her deceased father's farm. It is somewhat of a love story between Alexandra's brother Emil and their neighbor Marie. I liked the hope that Alexandra had for the farm. When everyone else sold their land and advised her to, she had faith that her farm would prosper and that faith paid off. Willa Cather did a great job with the writing in this book. It was simple and not too drawn out yet it still gave good descriptions, giving a mental picture of the enviroment. If you like these types of stories, I recommend picking this book up."
4,O'Pioneers,"I had to read this book for a Women's History class, and I found it to be so much more interesting than reading a text book. There are a lot examples in this book of things that were lectured in class. An example of this is that Cather touches on dowry rights of women during this time. Although this book is a novel, there is still a lot text book examples in it. I liked O'Pioneers, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in women issues of the past. Also, I'm living in the Mid West, so it's nice to learn about what is was like for the settlers."
1,Ouch! I've read term papers more interesting than this.,"It started out wonderfully, with the vividness and wonder that Cather usually presents, it just went downhill from there. The sixteen year jump in the middle of the book lost me. I lost all view of the characters and the situations in which they were involved. I was surprised to see Cather stoop to such a level. I highly recommend her other works, but O Pioneers, one of her first novels, didn't inspire as did the others. Some will find this story very enjoyable with a great descriptions of the Nebraskan plains, but for me, the vivid descriptions didn't overcome the lack of plot and storyline. Please forgive my frankness, but O Pioneers wasn't as great as I thought I would be. Sorry Willa. 8("
1,alarm goes off all the time,"I long for the day when a smoke detector went off if I was cooking something smokey and you could wave a towel under it to stop the alarm, or pull out the battery. We renovated our 150 year old house and had this system installed by our electrician. It goes off constantly even though all 20 of the batteries were replaced at once and the systems is cleaned regularly. It is a nightmare when the alarm goes off. We had the alarm go off this morning at 5:20 AM for a half an hour. We are removing the system."
5,The Bobs are the superior A Capella Band!,"The Bobs are amazing! This holiday CD has some of the most obscure songs... Don't get me wrong, this is not an insult. You will laugh so hard you will hurt! The lyrics are so intelligent and the stories told within are hilarious. If you don't own this you should and you should also listen/buy their other records: ""coaster""; ""i brow club""; ""plugged""; ""the bobs cover the songs of...""; ""shut up and sing!""; ""the bobs sing the songs of...""; ""best of the bobs""; ""songs for tomorrow morning""; ""my, i'm large""; and ""the bobs"". i highly recommend their cover albums - it's amazing to hear the likes of the doors, the beatles and johnny cash Bobs style!"
3,"""I Guess That's Something To Work On""","`Marion Bridge' is a somber, independent film from '03 filmed against the backdrop of the rustic landscape of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Similar to the well respected `The Shipping News' from '02 the storyline deals with a dysfunctional family displaying all the neglect, abuse and legacy of heartache that comes with it.While `Marion Bridge' lacks the big names and more dramatic storyline that accompanies `The Shipping News' the cast is superior nonetheless and the complicated, unresolved familial relationships played out between three sisters, a bedridden alcholic Mother, an estranged, deviant Father and a local teenage girl ring honest and believable.This is definitely not a film for everyone but worth a viewing, especially if you enjoy dealing with emotional, complicated and unresolved relational issues that arise from living in a not so perfect world."
2,Great premise but where's the plot?,"Whilst this story begins with great premise (the protagonist slowly realizes he is being a tour guide for a serial killer) - that's where any redeeming feature of the plot ends.The protagonist comes to this realization, fear sets in...and then...nothing. It's all atmosphere and staging with no discovery, resolution or climax. The end felt like I was watching a very bad and cliched B-grade horror movie ending."
4,A quick and gritty read,"In the Miso Soup is a very dark and violent thriller set in the seedier side of Tokyo. This novel is certainly very explicit in its descriptions of various crimes and the overall brutality that takes place, however there is more to the novel. Not only is the writing surprising good and well paced but there are also very deep moments throughout the narrative. If you are in anyway squeamish this novel should be avoided but if you can stomach the violence In the Miso Soup is certainly a page turning thriller that is worth a read."
3,Reader Beware,"The heart of this nasty little thriller is a mass murder that defies description--although the author manages to find the words. I skipped several graphs because I found the casual descriptions of sadism and torture overwhelmingly disgusting, unlike, for example, ""Out"" which teetered on the edge of black humor in its depiction of dismemberment. In ""Soup"" there is a prurience about the scene that offended me. Each to his own.Michael H. Margolin"
4,Exciting and thought provoking,"While not usually a fan of the ""slash and trash"" genre, Murakami's newest gives a reason to explore the subject of the serial killer. Examining both Japanese and American stereotypes and ideosyncracies, the book gives a fascinating portrayal of the ""man on the edge"". The book moves quickly and was over way before I was ready for it to end. While not his best work, this was worth waiting for. In many ways I can see this as ""American Psycho"" done correctly. The violence is a little over the top in some sections, but in a kind of quirky style, so not really offensive. Nice translation, no real issues there."
4,Almost perfect,"My kids, 3 and 5, developed a sudden fascination with the ""Chicken Dance."" I looked around for a good recording, and when I saw the Brave Combo version grabbed it (they think ""All Wound Up"" rules)We've been generally happy with one small nit. In their search for artistic differentiation the band has thrown in quite a few twists that, while they sound interesting, make it a bit hard to dance to. That's not cool for an album titled ""Group Dance Epidemic.""Still, it's a great kid's album and highly recommended."
5,A few new songs of Ronnie Aldrich never released!,"In this box of 4 CDs we can enjoy new songs of Ronnie as:-Laura-If I loved-Send in the clowns-Medley from ""The sound of music""These 4 songs are abolutely new for us (never released). With only that, you pay the value of the box!"
5,Absolutely Incredible,"The phrase - The Raleigh Ringers in concert - evokes three questions in my brain. Where - When - and how fast can I get tickets. This is a group not to be missed. I will not add to what the other reviewers have written because I agree totally with all of them.But I will say that when I heard the group in concert last Sunday in Lakeland, Fl., the announcement was made that the long awaited ""second video"" will be made in early 2013. YEAH!Grab it as soon as it is available."
2,Raider helmets,"I have this raider helmet and I'd have to say the same thing as the last review. I needed a helmet and went for a cheap one. It felt like it. If you aren't going to use it that much, then you can probably get away with it. But I would go for an HJC or a shoei helmet. I just purchased an HJC helmet and it feels so much better. You get what you pay for."
4,Great convenience for a mouse,"Very easy to install and use. It is great that you can have a full size mouse and a smaller portable mouse for the price of one. The AAA batteries you may have to change every month. Other than that, it is worth buying."
5,Kelly again,"She's gorgeous, has a voice and so much more. I wasn't disappointed with this. For any fan to have."
2,Why waste a DVD with 2 videos?,"I understand that she is the big winner of American Idol, but doesn't seem kind of silly to release a DVD with just 2 videos? I see it enough of VH1 and it is all over the radio. I think that the company that put this out is just wanting more money from their money making machine...To be honest, I would have waited until she had more videos under her belt. If that did not happen the company could have put her videos ""A Moment Like This and Before Your Love with all of her American Idol performances... The same thing could be done for Justin too...I saw this in the store one day and went ""Now what are they doing?"" I am sorry, I would not waste 7 dollars on a DVD with just 2 videos on it..."
5,ROPE PLANT,Really healthy and beautiful. Rapid Shipping and at a reasonable price. I have had this particular plant before and was very successful at getting it to bloom. I had to give all my plants away when I moved. These grew wonderfully in Michigan and now I am giving it a shot in Florida. I will try and update my success with this in a much warmer climate.
2,Not What I Expected,Maybe I was being unrealistic but I expected the rope plant to begin growing like a rope. I purchased the plant a year ago and it is exactly the same size as when I purchased it. The plant is healthy and looks nice but it does not seem to grow any longer. I purchased it in hopes of laying it over my window sill for a dramatic effect. Currently this is not possible. For anyone thinking of buying the plant just know that it will probably take years to grow to a decent size.
5,Exotic house plant,"Hindu Rope Plant - Hoya carnosa compacta - 2 1/2"" potThe plant is beautiful and represented well by the picture above. I love this plant. The plant is healthy and doing great. Good luck with yours!"
2,died,"This plant died also. Maybe the greenhouse that sent them had a ""bad"" batch. As stated above, will try again."
1,WARNING MEALY BUG INFESTED SELLER!!!!!! BUYER BEWARE!,"I placed a large order with this seller; including this plant. Shipping was fast. Packing was good. Out of the 4 plants; 3 died due to mealy bugs. This plant died last despite my & my local greenhouses best efforts to save it. My order was for:Hindu or Indian Rope Plant - Hoya - 6"" Hanging Basket : DEAD : MEALY BUGS[...]Hindu or Indian Rope Plant - Hoya - Exotic yet Easy : DEAD : MEALY BUGS[...]x2 of: Strawberries & Cream Wax Plant - Hoya - Great House Plant - 4"" Pot[...]1 plant : DEAD : MEALY BUGS which led to sooty mold (This one dies first.)1 plant: SAVED : cost me an additional 22.00 and 4 weeks to save it! It's now a one stem plant three inches tall which is NOT a very attractive houseplant.The seller can't blame me. I had just moved and had NO other houseplants. But also NO experience with mealy bugs til now. So thanks for that anyway.BUYER BEWARE!! SAVE YOUR OTHER PLANTS AND BUY ELSE WHERE!!"
3,Awesome plant,"I bought this from Amazon.comI love the plant. Unfortunately, my plants did not come alone. They came with unwanted ""bugs"". I was naive about the plant. I assumed these white powdery spots were upcoming flowers. I was so excited! My new plants has buds already. Then, the inevitable happened. The white furry spots multiplied rapidly. Then my beautiful plant started wilting and drying out. My plant that I was so proud of now resides at the landfill. Mealy bugs are common with these plants, please check your plants thoroughly."
2,"Um, mine came with friends!","I agree, a bit pricey, but hard to find these pretty plants around my parts. I noticed that the plant look like it was just plopped in this pot right before shipping, and it was extremely soaked...but ok...I was happy with it's size and color....until I found it's friends! Both of mine are covered with mealy bugs...and yes they came in on these, these are the only houseplants I have...and I don't have mealy bugs outside, not that these plants have ever been outside! Good buy, but make sure you have a bug killer already purchased...maybe purchase some of their ladybugs at the same time? LOL. I am not happy about the bugs! Hope they are easy to treat. I will try tonight."
1,Dying on arrival,"I wish that I had not ordered this plant. It was about 4 inches long when it came, and it never grew at all. Some sort of rot seemed to set in, and in a matter of weeks, it was dead."
3,Very Small Plant - Hirts,I was disappointed by the size of the rope - barely 3 inch and the plant came with tiny white bugs. I got rid off (hopefully for ever) them with diatomaceous earth - I would never buy such a small plant in a regular store.:-(
1,A disturbing warp on good songs,"I'll make this short and sweet: Kidzbop destroys good songs. It is actually amusing though to see just how horribly they distort them. All the children singing have extremely exasperating voices and after the initial amusement at the lameness, Kidzbop just oozes annoyance. You couldn't pay me enough to make me want to listen to this CD."
2,Snow job of the century,"If you think Kidz Bop is kid friendly think again. I could put up with tone deaf kids singing kid songs. What makes the content of these songs kid friendly? Just the fact that kids are on the tracks? Take a closer look and listen to the lyrics and situations portrayed in these songs. I checked this one out at the public library, glad I didn't buy it. As soon as I saw Irreplaceable on it I raised an eyebrow. Some of the songs I was not familiar with, but I can definitely say that this is anything but a ""Kidz Bop"" no matter how cute they try to dress it up with the chorus of kids voices. Kidz Bop needs to take responsibility and truly make it kid appropriate."
1,OMG... THEY KILLED IT!!!!!,"OMG THEY KILLED IRREPLACEABLE!!!!! these lil brats cant sing in the first place. they should stick to bawling out their abc's in the shower. but why must we sane people suffer through this CRUD?!?!?! for all you sane haters, dont buy this. these songs have ADULT CONTENT in them. little kids need to stick to PBS KIDS, not MTV! these songs go way 2 high for their voices. and the adults? i think they used to be turture devices. honestly. if you dont believe me, buy it while i buy the real version.one more thing. the ""cute"" lil 'z' at the end? no."
3,What Happened??,"My daughter (who will soon be 6) has always enjoyed the Kidz Bop CDs, and I've enjoyed hearing her sing along with them. I've always been happy with the fact that she's getting to hear some of the popular music she likes, without the cursing or inappropriate lyrics.Although there are many songs on this CD that I really like (and by that I mean the original versions of the song), something happened with this CD in that the kids they picked CAN'T SING! With all of the previous CDs, the kids were pretty good about carrying a tune, but that's not the case with this one. Even my daughter said that the singers sounded ""funky."" I couldn't agree more.Plus, as another reviewer has stated, hearing young kids sing about an ex-girlfriend while in a room next to the new girlfriend is a little disconcerting--not to mention downright creepy.Skip this volume and pick up some of the earlier ones. They're much more entertaining."
2,"Kidz clobber the ""classics""","Think pop music is already bad? Bored of the Buble/Timberlake/latest rapper with purposefully misspelled name? Then this CD confirms the worst is yet to come.Most pop music is awful...but when it's sung by a children's choir,it's worse.Kelly Clarkson's ""Walk away"" becomes a playground taunt,and the Fray's ""Over my head"",an emo indie rock song,becomes sappy.KT Tunstall's famously annoying ""Black Horse&Cherry; Tree"" gets an even worse cover by the Kidz Bop kids.John Mayer's anthem about changing the world&bringing; friends home from war gets slowed down&sugared; up.Of course,the Kidz Bop kids also sing about adult issues-such as asking a troublesome boyfriend to stay the night (""Too little,too late""),carrying on a romance in the public eye (""A Public Affair""),and cheating on one's girlfriend with one's ex (""Lips of an Angel"")Yeah..talk about kid friendly...yeah right."
4,Bernie is Bad,In the best sense of the word of course. a clasic old school; Funk albulm form the P-Funk family of musicians.
1,Not That Great,Despite Featuring some great funk artists this is a really weak disk not even worth the two dollars.
4,now THIS is how the 80's/early 90's shoulda/coulda/woulda been!,"bernie gets that 80's flava goin strong! favs;""volunteered slavery"" and ""beware of dog""!(the latter has keyboards that would've fit PERFECTLY on a p-funk or talking heads album!)"
5,get it cheap!!!,"they're selling it for only a few bucks used!!! if you dig bernie you need to get it,that simple! think funky 80's tunes with awesome guest spots from bootsy,keith richards,david byrne and a few others! it's waaaay cool!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Perhaps I've come to expect too much, even from a company such as Oxo, but I found this ice cream scoop quite disappointing. Its bowl size is much smaller than I had thought and hoped it would be. It's too small to make a really good cone. Also, the upper portion of the handle flexes when digging into hard ice cream. The tang of the scoop only goes as far as the bottom of the hole at the top of the handle. As the top of the handle is ""empty"", it flexes or bends. You have to hold the scooper way down, past the grip to avoid the flex. This is the same complaint seen on another Oxo scooper. My search for the ""perfect"" ice cream scoop continues. I would not recommend this item."
3,Skip this product,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products, but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review, I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore, after about 6 months of use, the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop, and feels ""wobbly"". It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand. I"
5,It gets my vote!,"This book doesn't need 1,000 words - it speaks for itself. We recommend it to all our students as the best value text book to have. An excellent primer before moving on to specialist books. I don't want to be responsible for our students spending a fortune on books, so I tell them that if they can't afford much, then this is the one to get. The problem with many film books is that you can spend a fortune on getting the wrong ones. There are lots of other good books but more expensive and this has all the basics you need to learn before you specialise."
4,Get up to speed with this book.,"The Filmmaker's Handbook is a comprehensive guide to the art & science of filmmaking. Though it is currently falling abit behind with it's coverage of digital technology, as this is moving so fast it's hard for any book to stay current.It has a lot of excellent information though, and goes into detail many other books lack. It's useful as a reference guide, and not so dry that it doesn't make an interesting read. If you are studying film, or want to get into the industry this book is a must have."
4,Little outdated but the bible of film making,"This is a got to have for any film makers. Sure it outdated. Most of you are not going to be using film nowdays. But understanding how to work the camera. What lenses do what and why. Correct lighting and filters. This book tells it all. Sure your not going to read it cover to cover but when, and you will, run into something that you can't figure out. This book generally has the answers."
4,"Out of date, but still a good start","This was my first book on filmmaking howto, and i don,t regret it. This is a general introduction to film making, covering both traditional 16-35 mm mediums and video. It's out of date if you're looking for references to all the latests video hd tech, but a nevertheless very worthwhile."
5,A must!!,"This is one of the best technical book about the craft of Film & Video I've ever read.Buy it!!If you are serious about filmmaking, this is a must read."
2,Strange Grouping of songs,"There are two things to point out first about this CD.First it is an IMPORT . This means it came from outside the US. Second, the first Harry Potter book's original British title was ""Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone"" (as was the Internation English movie title). The title was changed when J.K. Rowling sold the rights to Scolastic for US release.The next important thing to note, the songs that are included. If you search the web, you will find that most of the movies listed were released the same year (the rest seem to be 2000). This is the connection.I find this to be an interesting way to package some good music from multiple venues in one place. However, I definately see where it would be confusing for someone who is ONLY looking for music from the first Harry Potter movie. If this is what you are looking for, you may be disappointed."
5,Continues to Develop Brilliantly,"Michael Stackpole has done a splendid job of not writing a filler in a trilogy. This book has stunning plot twists, great action when needed, and breaks for breathing and thought when needed. The story moves along realistically yet with all the elements you'd expect from a good fantasy epic. Stackpole has also devoted energy to developing the characters further despite all the action going on. Well done."
5,loved it,My little 5-year-old birdwatcher grandson added it happily to his collection - I have ordered several others and he carries them off to bed in his pillowcase - many thanks
5,"""Christmas Dancing by James Last""- a review","This CD is a re-issue of the vinyl 33-1/3rpm album, which I came across a few years ago. While I lifted some of the tracks for inclusion in a Christmas compilation of favorites, inspite of audio editing software, there were minor flaws. So finding this album on a CD... was an absolute delight! It includes two extra tracks not on the vinyl sibling. ALL the ""medleys"" are superb, but Medleys (tracks) 1, 6, 8 & 10 are the best... James Last knows his music and his Christmas arrangements are enhanced with his ""chior."" You can do no wrong in obtaining this CD. James Last, the James Last sound and the music of James Last- ARE some of the best-kept secrets in the U.S. I have been enjoying his music (except for the ""Non-stop Last"" compilations) since 1962. One last note... his last name IS pronounced as ""LOST."""
5,Christmas Treasure,"Our family has been listening to this album since the early 70's. For some of us, it's the only Christmas album we *need* to hear every season."
4,Gr8 western,Typical western story line.4 stars becuz picture quality is a shade grainy.Priced a little high for a dvd-r with not the best picture.But good western.
3,Thanks for Canyon River release!,"The good things are that we now can see or see again George Montgomery westerns and that the product is in top concerning picture sharpness and sound. The bad things are that Montgomery though tall and handsome is a little boring. He seems to lack ... IT! And the story is very much in lack of action. And somebody tell me when we are out there in the beautiful country why must we inside a studio every time there is a camp fire? Well, you can enjoy Allan Hale Jr. who here appears as Allan Hale only. He is a fine and warm actor like his father. Some day I will see it again and perhaps find it a little better and I am happy to have it in my collection."
4,Great Movie,Anyone in the family can watch this movie. They do not have enough movies about cattledrives.I wish they would make more movies - George Montgomery is his usual nice self and the story is easy to follow.
4,The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing,This was a terrific all encompassing book on Real Estate investing. I have bought ten or fifteen books on the topic in the past year and found this to be the best so far. It is broad and somewhat introductory but there are tid bits for even seasoned investors to digest. It was also uplifting and motivatioal. An excellent start for the budding Real Estate investor!
3,Unofficial guide to real estate investing,"The book had good information, but it also had math errors and other, text typos.It made me question the source."
2,Probably best for Americans,"As a Canadian, I found I was pretty disappointed in the tax discussion in this text. This book is entirely based on the American system and does not even consider the possibility of readers in another nation. I would not recommend this book to fellow Canadians."
1,very light in content,The book is very light in content and written with a very narrow approach. If you want to learn anything about real estate don't buy this book.
2,Written by a committee - and it shows,"Although this book was very well organized and clearly written, it lacks depth and detail... almost as if many things were ""left out"" for one reason or another. I moved on to my next title""Investing in Real Estate"" 3rd edition, and I'm only on chapter 3 and have already gotten more out of it than I received from ""The Unofficial Guide"". If your looking for a great book on the subject, I would suggest you forego this title and go for the ""Investing in Real Estate"" 3rd edition instead."
5,Excellent Guide,"I highly recommend this book. It is a fun and easy primer to getting staarted in RE investing. With this book and the website Creative Real Estate Online, you can't go wrong! Happy investing!"
4,An excellent reference guide for investors,"The approach this book offers is refreshing and its laid out in a manner that makes it an easy reference guide. It covers a wide assortment of topics and has helpfull tips on the side of the pages for additional interest. I just counted my real estate investment book collection and including this book its up to seven.Of those seven this book would be one of the best. I would give this book a definate ""thumbs up"" and a buy for the novice to somewhat seasoned real estate investor. Another excellent (if dated) book is: How You Can Become Financially Independent by Investing in Real Estate by Albert J. Lowry. Too bad it is out of print but if you can find one buy it.My all - time fav."
4,"Good information, well presented","I have found this book to be useful in evaluating real estate investments. It is not the kind of book that you can use on its own; be sure to use common sense, and another good real estate book and/or a professional for backup. I personally used Robert Allen's book along with this. I liked the advice, the examples, and the tips. However, there is so much to cover, and the market changes from one place to another and from year to year. No book can cover all possible scenarios, so be sure to use your good judgment (and possibly someone else's, too)."
5,"Best book for basics, a must have for your desk","Being a part time real estate investor for the last 6 years I have ""self taught"" myself everything. Some lessons from hard knocks and some from books. I must have 10 or more books on real estate investing but, this is the book that constantly sits on my desk. I've underlined, highlighted, dog eared, and copied many many parts of this book. Yes, in some cases it is a very broad overview but then again, it touches on almost everything related to investing. It covers the basics thoroughly and that is what keeps me coming back to this great book again and again."
3,Sushi mold,I have used this sushi mold several times. It makes fine sushi but I prefer to make sushi with my rolling mat.
3,it was okay,"The mold cleans up easily and is simple to use. However the top piece is not rounded, so the sushi comes out flat and sort of rectangular shaped, not round. Also the holes for the slices are too far apart, and they don't go down far enough, so it is hard to cut all the way through the slices, even putting the top piece underneath the sushi. It's okay to use to get started making sushi but it has some flaws."
4,Great ending,"When you are looking to finish up Gurren Lagann, you can't go wrong with the special edition. It has the last nine episodes of the series, the two disk CD that has all the themes and endings on one disk, and all the awsome music from the series on the other disk. The first volume of the manga is included in the set as well. The manga remains true to the storyline while staying interesting as well."
2,Not so good.,"The new battery I purchased doesn't seem as good as the original one, it needs to be charged more frequently, although the price was low I think the quality is low too."
1,You call this a battery?,I purchased a new battery for my phone because the old one needed recharging after 3 or 4 days - well this brand new one needs recharging after only 2 days - it sucks big time. I ended using my old one again because it lasts longer.
1,Wouldn't hold a charge,"This battery didn't last any longer than the old battery that it replaced. I tried several charge-and-drain cycles to try to make it last longer that about 24 hours, but to no avail. Company said it would reimburse my credit card."
3,Nokia Battery,"My cell phone is 2 years old! Tried to buy a replacement battery as my battery wasn't holding a charge !Went to the VERIZON Store where I purchased my phone was told ""YOUR PHONE IS TOO OLD !"" we do not carry your battery TRY AMAZON.COM ! Found my batteryNokia BL-4C Li-Ion Battery for Nokia 5100/6100 PhonesI purchased two batteries at a very reasonable price they also sent a USB cable to charge from my computer & sync my music !!! At no extra charge !! The Battery does not ""SEEM"" to hold a charge as well as when my old battery was ""NEW""???"
2,Low standby time,The battery doesn't last long. It is a Chinese product and doesn't look like an original Nokia battery. But that's what you get when you pay $3 including delivery! That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.
4,Good for phrasal learning!,"If you would like to learn some phrases in Spanish by themes, this is great because it has the phonetic spellings under each and every phrase. It progresses logically from one subject to the next, and is a very LARGE book.If you're like most of my Spanish students and want to know the WHY behind phrases, this should be used more as a supplement. I would use this only for older teens and college to adults. Younger children need something more interactive like Flip Flop Spanish."
3,great guitar work,One dosnt hear the quality of guitar playing that Norm Blake performs very often...better than Chet Atkins. The voice and fiddle work dont quite measure up to the guitar. It ia a useful collection for reference for pickers.
2,a little volume please,i must warn the listeners the volume of this cd is very low. you will have to turn your stereo up very loud to listen. then be careful to turn back down. before playing next cd. pity rounder won't remaster this cd for some better sound because the music itself is excellent.
4,One of the best bands I've never heard of,"Don't let the name fool you, Mrs. Hippie is a metal band that can give some of the best in the business a run for their money. If you are into heavy metal with crunching guitars, melody, and vocals that aren't a gutteral growl, then try this CD. There is an excellent rendition of KISS' ""I Want You"" as well as a great collection of original material. Highlights include ""Voices In My Mind"" and ""Mother Nature Bleeds"". Metalblade Records certainly has another great band in it's line-up."
2,Hmmm....,Well i was given this Cd by a friend and i understand why he was so eager to give it away.I dont know maybe some people are into this but this aint my style.There are a couple decent tracks on here but the vocals just dont do it for me.
4,we need a shedless brush..,This barbecue basting brush was everthing that I expected. However I wish it did not shed so much. I love the rubber handle and how long it was. Dont have to worry about burning my arm anymore when grilling. If you dont mind some shedding from the brush on occasion. this is a good pick. Lets hope someone can make a sheddless brush in the near furture..hint hint..oxo.ITS HARD TO FIND A BRUSH THAT DOES NOT SHED!!
3,"Good, but could be better","I have several of the OXO BBQ utensils, and while I like this BBQ sauce brush, the product could be improved by replacing the bristles (they are replaceable, or are able to be pulled out as a glued block on my unit) with a high-temp silicon ""mop"" style end. Good quality and love the grip!"
3,Trich 101,"Cheryn did a fine job expressing her pain and soul searching. There have been many breakthroughs on this condition she did not mention. It is sad that her daughter suffers as well. I am a sufferer, however not with the eyelash or eyebrow symptoms. I have been pulling my hair for nearly 25 years. Off and on. More on I would have to say. I did get a new perspective on this illness. I certainly understand the shame attached to it. Her acceptance was remarkable. I felt like God was inappropriately introduced however, this is her life and her illness to battle. Whatever works."
1,Very simply put for the person who knows nothing about trich,"This book is geared toward the parent, relative of a trichototillomania (TTM) sufferer. It offers no greater insight than what the sufferer already knows. But for the relative/friend of a sufferer then this book is a child-like insight of what one person's experience with TTM was. I would rank this book very low due to the non-information regarding TTM that is in it."
4,this is worthwhile - better than a cd stacker,"sound quality is there, took under 5 minutes to have it operational. longer of course to hide the wires etc. glad to have purchased"
1,A Coleman Product?,I cant believe Colman would put it's name on junk like this. Even if it actuly worked it woulden't be worth $4.95.I thought I felt some heat when I first turned it on but it was hard to tell. After 2 min. no heat at all. It went out with todays garbage.
2,Very disappointed and heater was returned,"I purchased the Coleman Ceramic Heater due to a problem with my car which doesn't allow us to use the heat or defrost. I was very disappointed when I plugged in the product and no heat was given off at all, just a weak stream of cool air. I figured initially that the car must need to be warmed up but unfortunately, the heat was not affected by the engine warming up at all. Neither levels of airflow produced heat. I suppose there is a chance that we received a faulty product or there was a problem with our cigarette lighter (although it definitely had power). I hope you have a better experience with this product. I was pleased with the speed in which AutoBarn returned our money, even if we did lose a good portion of the return for shipping costs."
1,Heater? A teensy bit.,"All right -- there are two settings, one for fan (air only) and one for heat. I tried both. Results about the same. A tiny bit of heat on the ""heat"" setting -- enough to warm a toe or two.Back it goes. Coleman? Don't these folks know how to test their products anymore? Just because it's made in China doesn't mean it works."
4,works great! but you need to read the directions...,"Like the other users that have commented here, I was initially very disappointed. However, as I was grumbling and about to throw away the user guide, I decided to (gasp!) read it. Turns out the on/off switch is a 3 position switch, marked with 3 symbols: A Roman numeral I, A Roman numeral II, and a 0 (Zero). So, I thought that zero was OFF, and number I would be LOW and number II would be HIGH. Turns out that number I is AIR ONLY and number II is AIR + HEAT. After trying it out on II, it was nice to discover a decent amount of heat coming out. I installed 3 of them on my daughter's Blazer, since there are three large pieces of rear glass that are always fogging up, and these 3 units perfom pretty well. Not hot enough to pose a fire hazard, but warm enough that after 5 minutes of operation, there is about a two foot circle of clear glass, and here in Alaska, that isn't too shabby."
5,Its a mallet,"Not advisable to use as a chisel pounder. Originally I bought the product to punch holes with a leather punch, but the punch wasn't that great, and I resorted to using a power drill. But then I needed to get my ikea 'furnature' together, and this product was pretty useful. Great for pounding things that you don't want to dent!"
3,Stinky,This is mallet looks pretty sturdy but man does it stink. I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and can't seem to find a place I can store this thing without it bothering me. The smell is so bad it gave me headaches but if you have a garage or tool shed this shouldn't be a problem.
4,Helps when I need it,"I ordered this mallet to use in my kitchen to make it easier to cut hard-shelled vegetables such as winter squash and sweet potatoes. I wanted something that I could use to hit the back of my knife to give it a little more power to punch through the tough skin, but that wouldn't damage it. A rubber mallet seemed to be just the answer. This one really makes short work of the job, and I'm happy with it.I would have given it 5 stars, except for when I received it, it had such a terrible odor that I couldn't stand to keep it in the kitchen. I wrote to the vendor, and he told me that the rubber was still curing, and eventually the odor would subside. I set it away in a window, and after several weeks, the smell has mostly dissipated. It still smells a little, but is now bearable. This is the only drawback, and other than that, this mallet was just what I needed.Inexpensive and useful product, good value, and great customer service from the vendor."
1,Very Short Life,"This mallet worked well for a brief time, but after only one afternoon of moderate work the mallet head fell off. I taped it on with duct tape, but it was unstable and completely unusable. A disappointment, and nearly a disaster as I was in the field at the time."
1,Phil,I would never buy this mallet again! After using it only three times the mallet came off the handle. Very poor quality
2,Made with poison,"I recently recived the Tekton Fiberglass hammer. Before I opened the package I could smell the bad odor of chemicals. After I opened it, checked it out I found a small label that said, ""California Warning: This product contains lead and phthalate chemicals known to the state of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm please wash hands after use"". I haven't used this rubber hammer yet and I'm sure it will do its job fine but... I will be sending it back due to the lead and phthalate chemicals since I will be using this quite often. Being made in China might explain this."
2,"I Love Lucy, But Not This Special","I LOVE Lucy. ""I Love Lucy"" is the greatest show ever, but this botched special celebrating the series' 50th anniversary was just bad. Who cares what Andy Garcia, Cher or Roseanne have to say? I would like to have seen more focus on William Frawley and Vivian Vance, whose on-screen chemistry with Ball and Arnaz really helped to make ""I Love Lucy"" so funny. It goes to show you that the days of wonderfully funny shows like ""I Love Lucy"" are long gone. Not one person in Hollywood today is talented enough to hold a candle to the producers and creators of ""Lucy"" and this [bad] attempt at a two hour special to celebrate it is a mockery of the show's half century contribution to laughter."
2,Good words about Lucy,"I love Lucy, I really do... But I was disappointed by this DVD: I've purchased it to enjoy ""I Love Lucy"" show and got a number of celebreties talking ABOUT Lucy instead...Bits and pieces, not a single full episode on a whole DVD. Do not buy it..."
5,A Heartfelt Memoir,"Paul Fussell is one of the more ascerbic commentators on American life today. Nowhere is he more heartfelt than in Doing Battle, his own personal memoir. Fussell concentrates on his World War II experiences, when he was wounded both physically and emotionally. The story of his journey from a rather pampered Southern California youth to a war veteran recuperating in a field hospital is a contrarian view of the experiences of at least one member of ""The Greatest Generation"" His life afterwards, when he served on the faculties of a number of universities and made a name for himself as a scholar and social commentator, also makes for enjoyable reading. Witty, urbane, and honest, Doing Battle is one of the great autobiographies"
4,"Could better be titles ""making of a curmudgeon""","Paul Fussell has already written two excellent books debunking the myths, selling, and romanticizing of war. This book presumably is anaccount of Fussell's experience in war (really the Army), which is good - but only about a third of the book - and how it made the man. Behind the ""chicken-shit"" does Fussell really think the war ought not to have been fought or that there was a nice way of fighting it - the whole history of war suggests not. And for those who have read his earlier books it is an unrevealing account of Fussell the person. For example he barely mentions his son - who's crazy experience as a bodybuilder were the material of the son's own book and must have touched the father is some way. His first wife appears to have had a career as a writer on food; she passes in barely a couple of pages. How much more of Fussell the person is hidden?"
2,de mortuis nil nisi malum,"Recently deceased Fussell is someone you would not want on your department faculty or at an academic cocktail party. Although more talented than most leftist professors he here reveals himself as anti-American, snobbish, leftist. elitist, and a thoroughly disreputable excuse for an academic. He manages to combine every obnoxious leftist characteristic save horror at our use of the A Bomb to save American lives. A little religion might have done him some good."
1,Doing Battle: The Making of a Skeptic,Unless you enjoy seeing the US Army trashed save your money. Very twisted view of the WWII Army and those belonging to it. I agree with a previous writer that had the author been a officer doing his job his men would have been trained properly. As a retired Army officer and combat veteran I found the book offensive to say the least.
1,Very Disappointed,"Madcatz is usually a pretty reliable brand as far as accessories for video game consoles go, but they've let me down this time. This component cable set appears to be well manufactured, but is a little thin as far as the wire gauge goes and the output to my TV shimmers and wavers constantly. Output is bad for both games and DVDs -- I don't know how anyone can buy these cables and use them. In fact my Intec S-Video cable looks much better and it's constucted of higher gauge wiring. I can't see spending the ridiculously overpriced $50-$80 for ""ultra-premium"" offerings from Monster Cable or like brands, guess some middle ground has to be found from the high rated Sony or likely more reliable Intec brand."
3,"Works pretty well, but not durable","I just busted my second OXO Jar Opener. The first one lasted a few months, the second one a couple of years. Once the plastic holding the teeth down cracks, it's all over. The metal teeth sometimes slip off jar lids violently, but I didn't have any mishaps. Before it broke, it was easy to use, opening most jars for me, except some of the widest mouthed ones. I have a really weak grip, so I used it frequently. I think this is a good jar opener, but not a great one. It won't last forever, but it stores easily in a drawer. Good, but I'm moving on to another model, or another manufacturer."
1,OXO Baaaaaaad Grips(NO Grips),"I think this is THE worst kitchen helper I have ever purchased. It will slip off unexpectedly while you are trying unsuccessfully to unscrew a jar lid. I have come close to injuring myself a number of times, so will not use it any longer. I would give it a minus 5, actually, but that wasn't an option.I do not recommend this to anyone. It is easier to whack the lid with a butter knife and then smack it on the underside of the jar a few times...works for me, and hey, it's free!!!!!!"
1,Completely Useless,"From the moment I got this jar opener, it was a waste. It has no traction at all and leaves marks on jar lids. I bought it to replace an old, basic jar opener that I misplaced, but I might as well have flushed the money down the drain."
5,Can't live without it!,I have had this for over 5 years. I use it at least once a week to open a bottle or a jar that I just can't grip. Works fabulously!
1,Broke in the first week,"I bought this to help me open jars as I have tendonitis and have difficulty. While I was unsuccessfully trying to open a pickle jar, it slipped out of my hands, fell on the floor and broke.Give me the old fashioned kind any day."
1,This should be recalled,"Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen. The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid, but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched. Well, this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way. Like other reviewers noted, it doesn't secure well enough to the lid, slips off the lid, and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar. I'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward, uncomfortable, dangerous product."
2,OXO changed the design. Not good.,"Apparently OXO changed the design of their jar opener. I already had the jar opener that was pictured and I wanted a 2nd one for on the go because they work so well. When I received my item, I ended up getting the one pictured here:Good Grips Jar Opener. Like the previous bad reviews, this model has sharper teeth which tend to cut into the jar tops. It's not built as well as the old model and my guess will fall apart before my old one does, which I've had for around 10 years. So much for new product design(AKA cost cutting)."
1,Disappointment from Oxo,"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another. The first one broke after using it a three or four times, but since I like Oxo products in general, I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out, it uses tiny, metal teeth to grip the lid, which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless, so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a spoon. Works better than Oxo, that's for sure."
2,Leaves jagged edges on metal lids,"Don't use this product to open jars with metal lids, such as baby food jars. The metal teeth leave jagged edges on the lids, which makes it really easy to cut yourself if you ever try to open the jar with your hands."
5,GREAT tool,"I've had one of these for years and could not live without it. I even struggled to get milk jug caps off and this does the job in a second. I'm buying one for a single friend who mentioned that she can't get jars open anymore. The reviewer who had difficulty using it probably was not keeping it parallel to the lid--it has to be snug to the top of the lid, not at an angle to it."
1,Doesn't open everything,"I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed. It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use. My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble. The opening is way too big to accomplish that so, back it went to the supermarket. I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it doesn't, I am rating this only one star."
1,Worthless,I own at least a dozen Oxo products and I love every one - except this one. It doesn't make opening jars easier at all. It slips on the lids and only opens jars that I could easily open by hand. After the first week I gave up in disgust and this utensil hasn't been out of the drawer since. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Bought two of these, one for my mother and one to keep. What a total waste of money. Even my husband could not use this device easily. We finally just trashed them both as no use allowing junk to take room in our kitchens."
1,"Aughhhh, competely useless!","I have always wanted one of these and finally wasted my money and bought one. More pressure is needed to hold this device on the lid of a jar than it would take just to open the jar in the first place. If you are buying this because of small hands or weak grip, don't bother. My husband can make it work, but by the time he is in the kitchen he can just open the jar for me. The teeth to hold the lid are shallow and slip off the jar if you don't apply enough downward pressure. I have never been so disappointed in a kitchen gadget!"
2,Mediocre,"I've bought several of these products after hand surgery. The handles on all of them are great, but this can opener lacks in its ability to grip well, and so I often go back to the old fashioned method."
1,I Need More Power,"This item lacks the heavy dutiness that it needs to open the toughest of jars. This opener does about the same as I can do with my hand, and that's about it. It is not long enough to get the leverage required to open some jars. Also this item does not fold away or store away nicely at all. If you have an extra spot in your drawers for it go ahead and buy it, otherwise don't!"
1,This jar opener is terrible,"Unfortunately, this seems to be the only type of jar opener available, other than the largely ineffective plastic grip pads. You will discover that, although it works, it is clumsy in actual use, and worse, it will always gouge metal out of the jar lid, frequently leaving jagged metal edges to cut your fingers. If anyone ever discovers a better type of jar opener, please let me know. Thanks!"
3,Worked as expected,The product was ok. It is a little awkward to use on certain jars but it did work as expected
1,Useless Item,"I recently purchased this item to keep at work. I didn't realize it was different from my old one at home as it doesn't have metal on both sides. Results - it won't open anything. Because on the one plastic side, it slips and cannot grip the lid. Suggest only the ones with metal on both sides - they really work!"
4,A vast improvement over those rubber pads!,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower! I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily, but also they didn't work very well. So far, OXO's version has been a big improvement: the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids, and with a simple twist, the lid is off cleanly and neatly. I have found that the unit can sometimes slip, especially with a very small lid, but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface, you should have mostly success, as I have."
2,"Usually works, sometimes slips. Damages the lid.","The handle sure is comfortable, just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber, it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip, the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid, non-damaging material."
4,Muscle for those of us without any :),"I love this jar opener. I'd give it a 5, but it does occasionally slip off the jar (what opener doesn't?) and it does leave grooves in the lid at times. However, 9 times out of 10, it does an effortless job of opening even the toughest jars. I've even used it on plastic bottle tops for sticky Karo Syrup, and soda tops that have pressurized themselves onto the bottle. The positives far outweigh the negatives with this tool. It's size is great, too! It's able to accomodate small caps to large jar lids. I even catch my old jar opener (my husband!) using it once in a while :)"
4,Works as well as any other I've tried,"I haven't found a jar opener that works better than this one, even though it isn't perfect. The lever action works much better than the kind that require you to grip the jar lid and turn, but the ""teeth"" will occasionally slip and scratch the jar lids.Works really well on plastic lids."
2,Warning: This Tool May Expire,"This jar opener worked quite well for the first couple of months--it made the process of opening jars very easy--until it broke. I was trying to open a particularly stubborn jar of applesauce, and suddenly one of the two metal strips or ""teeth"" that grip the jar lids went flying across the kitchen, along with the plastic piece that was _supposed_ to hold it in place. Turns out, it was only attached by a couple of thin plastic pegs, which couldn't have been expected to survive for very long under the stresses that such a tool experiences."
4,Oh...,"I don't think the other reviews are accurate in the sense that they all knock this as not being a FC Kahuna album...but one look @ the tracklisting and you can see it's not.This cd is a collection of late night dance songs compiled by the memebers of FC Kahuna. I'll agree that it's not for everyone, but for the most part I love it. From the opening Jolly Music track ""K-Fun"" to the awesome closing song by The Polyphonic Spree I don't think this cd dissapoints @ all...I love it...in fact if I could have it's children I would......oh."
5,"GIVE THE MAN A BREAK, FOLKS!!!!","FC Kahuna has done a masterful job of putting songs together for any late night party occasion!!! Hell, you try DJing a party and making all the songs flow without dead silence! FC Kahuna mixes without you even being aware that a track has changed! Just think, this could be another dance mix CD full of material you've heard a million times before--and do we really need another one of those??? HELL, NO!!!!"
1,Bought it because I thought Hayling was great...,"But this album isn't. I'd HIGHLY recomend listening to this album at a record store before buying it. Simply put, I was very dissapointed."
2,The third dimension is NOT terror... its stupidity!,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is not a worthy sequel to the legendary JAWS. It's stupid, the mechanical shark looks like a giant piranha, and its just boring. It's set in seaworld Florida. Whatever happened to Amity island?This peice of junk is pathetically unsuspenseful. Hello, where has John Williams got to? Not once did I hear the JAWS theme.The only good thing about this movie is the gore. That's it.A cheap waste of money. Oh, and by the way, I'm not even going to bother writing a review for JAWS revenge because its even rubbisher than this one!!!!!"
3,Still oddly entertaining.,"This one is more funny than frightening. Why? It's those ridiculous made for 3D effects that remain long after you lost your cardboard glasses! Again, the Brody clan still gets too close to the water - and Louis Gossett Jr. comes along for the ride! The shark is bigger - and somehow smarter!? The revenge twist shows up - only to be fully envisioned in one of the worst movies ever - Jaws 4."
2,A bomb,"I loved the first 2 Jaws films. As a child I saw this one also and it scared me, I was in the video saw and decided to rent it. Definatly nott as scary as I remember there were quite a few laughs, unintentially I am sure. the 3D effects were just laughable I had a good time watching it but don't expect to to be horrified."
1,"If Spielberg were dead, he'd be roling over in his grave","Steven Spielberg's timeless classic ""Jaws"" made viewers afraid to go in the water for the rest of their lives. It's second sequel, ""Jaws 3"" will make viewers ashamed and embrassed to admit sitting through it. The acting is terrible, but not half as bad as the idiotic and contrived plot. ""Jaws 2"" was no gem, but at least it was a tasteful, and mildly stylish outing. Quite honestly, ""Jaws 3"" is an embrassment to all involved. This is god-awful, but not even HALF as bad as ""Jaws the Revenge."" Sea World should have sued this movie for representing their employees as arrogant, airhead morons."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE A DISGRACE TO THE JAWS NAME,"JAWS 3 is the worst film I have ever seen. I even fell asleep watching it. DENNIS QUAID""S acting in this film as well as LOU GOSSETTS JR'S and BESS ARMSTRONG""S acting performances as well leave a lot to be desired. I thought the GREAT WHITE SHAR'KS in this movie looked so fake I couldn't help but laugh at them when I was awake unforunately during the film. I wish that STEVEN SPEILBERG AND PETER BENCHLEY had sued the filmmakers who had made this film which was a disgrace to the JAWS name."
1,Not good at all...,"This movie is so awful that you have to see it! The effects are really bad and they used very similar scenes from the original Jaws. Jaws 3 was way to long. The photography was so bad that you couldn't tall if someone was dead or alive. You had to guess. If you don't like blood, don't see this movie. Unlike Jaws and Jaws 2 this movie has the dead people on the screen for a fairly long period of time. After I saw it I was really embarrassed for the director, Joe Alves. The acting was alright, it was just the photography, the plot and the lack of the Jaws theme song (it was only used once) that made the movie so bad. However, I do think you should see it just so you can say you've seen all three Jaws movies."
3,JAWS 3,"IT IS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE JAWS MOVIES. I HAVE ALL OF THE JAWS FILMS NOW, BUT THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORETS-JUST BECAUSE IT IS IN 3-D IT JUST MAKES THE MOVIE MORE FUN TO WATCH. WHEN YOU DO OR IF YOU DO NOT WEAR A PAIR OF 3-D GLASSES (THE MOVIE IS MADE SO YOU CAN BUT YOU DONT NEED TO) THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE IS THE BEST."
3,JAWS 3,JAWS 3 what can I say?well its ok.I don't know!I remember this movie being much better when I was 5.Now its not near as good.I don't know what happened with the Jaws series.I mean 1&2 were really good!this ones just kindof not a JAWS movie.The shark roars under water!I laugh everytime I see that part.Also the shark swims like 2 centimeters an hour!ok thats how sucky the mechanical shark is!But I would buy this movie anyway because its kindof good but still kindof sucky.
1,35 foot great white my ass!,It was stupid! I know sharks my dad is all about sharks. In fact I have studied sharks with my dad ever since I could read. I love the first 2 jaws they are 650% more likely to happen than this rummage. all copies of this garbage should be burned or made into crappy fireworks!
3,Jaws III,"The third ""Jaws"" film was okay, and I'm sure the special effects in theatres were fascinating, but on video the effects were fake and the shark looked like an oversized goldfish. Roy Scheider is missed, but Dennis Quaid plays his role as his son Mike well. But the film doesn't make sense in the future. In this film, Mike's close girlfriend, Dr. Morgan, is named Kathryn. In ""Jaws; The Revenge"", Mike's wife is not Kathryn but Carla, who isn't even a marine biologist. In this film, Mike is a chief park engineer, and in ""Jaws; The Revenge"" he's a near-Ph.D. marine biologist. Other than the special effects and the comparisons to the others, Jaws III is a pretty good addition to the Jaws saga."
4,Grows on you,"This obviously dosen't compare to the original and a few years ago it would have got a 2 or 3 from me, but it's grown on me. I would have liked to experience the 3-D aspect of the film, but was only 3 years old at the time. The sound track is eerie and perhaps matches any of the 4, especially the begining sequence. Very much worth checking out."
1,NEVER EVER SEE THIS MOVIE!,"In this movie the shark is so fake and even 3-D would not help.The absolute worst part of this movie is when the shark breaks through the glass of the ship thing, his back fin didn't even move!and when it breaks through the glass guess who it ate oh good guess the african american dude.HELLO RACISM!this movie should have not even attempted to come out it was a waste of time and money so move on with your life and ignore this movie trust me and take this advice whether im a kid or not!"
1,Boooo!,"The first ""Jaws"" was great---most of the sequels were really, really bad. I like the idea of the giant great white shark attacking Sea World. However, thirty-five feet is a little bit bigger than the original (25 feet), but who's counting? The underwater aquarium which is literally underwater is ridiculous. How are you supposed to get down there in the first place? Stairs? Elevator? Electricity doesn't really work underwater. How do they have lights lighting the aquarium? What if Jaws gets near it? Duh. Well, anyway, the part where Jaws attacks the main control room of the submerged aquarium is really, really fake. If you like Jaws, this is good. If you want a good shark movie, see the original or ""Deep Blue Sea""."
1,This movie fails!,"1,2, and 4 are best leave out 3. Why is the title named Jaws 3-D? Where are the 3-D glasses? I mean the effects are just horrible. I enjoy the rest of the series but this one is just boring. They should re-release this movie in theater with 3-D glasses and I would probably give this movie a good rating but for now this movie just sucks."
2,Don't waist time.,"It's not worth watching.The 3-D tries to get you but it's a bad movie.Hello, you could buy 7 toys at Toys R Us if you don't watch this.The other two Jaws were so addicting!I'd rather watch Barney for 2 hours if I had to watch Jaws 3.It was a cheap waste of money to make this movie.How on earth can a shark roar?And a shark trying to kill people because a mother shark's baby dies?How does a shark swin backwards?Don't watch this movie just because it's in 3-D.Don't waste time.I was able to enjoy Jaws and Jaws 2.They're so classic.I thought I'd give this at least 3 stars.Don't waste time.Believe me, I've been reviewing movies with my friend for 1 year!I am a tough critic."
2,Just Fun,"I remember seeing this 3D Jaws at the movie theaters and I got it just for my Jaws collection. It's still fun to watch if you remember not to take it seriously--after all, it does have Dennis Quaid in it."
1,BAD,"This is the worst shark movie ever made beside Jaws Revenge, Jaws 1 and 2 were much better. The sharks looked like they were glued on to paper in the film. The worst part of the film is where the shark breaks into the underground water thing it looks totally fake.It looks like 3 year olds made this film who knows what the budget on this film was but I bet I could afford it with my allowance. And I don't even get allowance. BAD+BAD+BAD+BAD= Jaws 3!!!!"
1,What were they thinking!!!,I am a big fan of Jaws i loved jaws and Jaws 2 but this was downright Horrible. A bad story combined crappy graphics makes up jaws 3. this film features Micheal brody(Dennis Quiad) and Sean Brody. the story of a killer shark getting into seaworld is really bad. this was just another pathetic attempt to make another jaws movie. it was a discrace to be even called jaws
3,Good sequel,"The second sequel to Jaws is a entertainment and scary movie. The effects is sometimes so bad and the shark is not a animal, it`s a machine but I like this movie. Dennis Quied is good and the rest of the cast is also good. I want to see this film in 3-D, that`s my big dream. Very good film!"
3,Jaws-might as well be Free Willy,"(sigh) Well, the thought of seeing the ""Jaws"" at Sea World was sure to be exciting, it came up short, Jaws 2 was good, and you were saying to yourself, ""Hey, maybe this series won't become alot of cheesy low budget movie with puppets kind of series afterall"" EH! Well, to bad after Jaws 3, you know it was, Jaws 3 was worth seeing, but Jaws 4 it just as scary and exciting as watching wallpaper dry."
2,A campy Sequel to Jaws.,A Flordia Attaction Park has discover that a Shark enter thier park but when the Shark dies. Even more larger Shark has come to attack on the attractions and taking the workers and cilivans of the theme park.Directed by Joe Alves (Who was the Production Desginer on Jaws and the Sequel). This sequel barely has something to do with the Another two Jaws Films. Dennis Quaid seems to play the Son of Chief Brody! This film is Pretty Dumb but It`s not that bad. Kids might enjoy this one. It's watchable and it was also a Box Office Hit. Originally Filmed in 3-D. Arriscope. Grade:C+.
2,3-D added no depth to this flaccid thriller.,"A pregnant Great White shark swims into the man made lagoon of Sea World (which was designed and built by one Mike Brody) and begins knoshing on swimmers, all one of them. Not much else happens.The third film in the now dead in the water series appeared to be the worst it could possibly get, that is until Joseph Sargent dropped the Jaws The Revenge stinkeroo into theaters a scant four years later.Jaws 3-D is marred by slow pacing, poor effects, a terrible score, and a juvenile script. Connections with the first two films are slight, making me suspect that the references were last minute additions to an in name only sequel. A real low water mark."
3,Jaws in Sea World,"The grown up Brody sons (Dennis Quaid & John Putch) have a new shark adventure to contend with when a baby shark enters Sea World through a faulty gate and dies shortly after. The shark's mother soon follows her offspring into the park, and Sea World finds itself with a new (and unintended) attraction. Nothing really scary, and the loss of the 3-D effects on television don't help matters much. One saving grace is Lou Gossett Jr., who always watchable, but neither the story or the shark scenes hold much water."
4,Not to bad,This movie wasnt to bad although it had nothing to do with the first two Jaws movies ecsept for refrences. the first time i saw this i realized that the shark goes like 2 miles P.H. and in the oters he goes faster. the shark is also far to fake looking. You can even tell that the fin is fake. They try to add way to many scenes with the whole shark in it witch hasent been done. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because I love the first two and I love sharks.
2,Way too fake...,"Although vaguely attached to the original in its content, this film is hardly worth being included in the series. This time, the shark (which has grown to Godzilla proportions) decides to wreak havoc on innocent bathers in a more hyped up beach resort (obviously the producers were tired of the quaintness of Amity Island.) Mother's revenge on those for stealing her baby? Alright, so the shark's top ""lip"" twitches, but the characteristic grey-white color of the Great White shark has been lost?! I wonder if anyone noticed, but the shark is kind of lazy too. It hardly moves, besides a feeble ""wagging"" of the tail once in awhile. What happened to Joe Alves jr.'s original design (which was perfect)? Obviously twenty-five feet just wasn't big enough! Please, just stick to the original!"
2,Second Jaws sequel is dull but has some redeeming qualities.,"The 2nd Jaws sequel is definetely not the worst, Jaws The Repulsive, I mean Jaws The Retarded, oops I MEAN JAWS THE REVENGE IS!!!!!!!! Jaws 3 has a great musical score, nifty plot, and a few dramatic moments, BUT... none of the characters are really engaging. You don't care about them as people so the movie is dull. Atleast the film is original. The plot centers around Brody's son Michael(Quaid) and his job at seaworld in Florida. Roy Sheider is sorely missed."
1,Stupid,"This movie is by far the STUPIDEST movie I have ever seen. Here are my reasons:1. The quality of the mechanical shark is equivalent to that of a Happy Meal toy.2. There's blood every 6-10 minutes.3. Sharks getting into Sea World? Whoever made this movie was really running low on ideas.4. The characters are stupid and unbelieveable.5. After the main characters (I can't remember their names) capture the shark that had been tormenting them and killing everybody, they put it on display at Sea World. That's real smart.6. The shark on display wasn't really the shark that was killing everybody, it was actually the CHILD of the shark that was killing everybody, and then they have to kill the mother (The writers probably decided to add that in because it probably would have been a weak ending if they hadn't).I could go on forever with reasoning why you should not watch this."
1,Simply a crappy movie.,"I did not know that white sharks grow up to 35 feet.DUHH!! They don't! Since when do sharks care for their young? They don't. Baby sharks are on their own since birth and in some cases, the parent tries to eat them. Really fake and cheesy effects. I went back to blockbuster for a $2.14 refund on this movie. Okay for a snowy or rainy day."
1,Hysterically Bad!,"While the original Jaws had us glued to our seats in a state of sheer terror, Jaws 3 had us rolling around the floor laughing our little 3-D glasses off ! We snickered at a 35-foot piece of foam-rubber with ugly fake teeth and we howled at the so-called actors who took part in this honey of a film. Inept is too kind a word to describe the thespian skills of those who grace this glorified middle school production. I wonder if Mr. Gossett or Mr. Quaid proudly include this masterpiece on their resumes? Honestly, Jaws 3 is so hysterically bad that it's actually fun. No, it's beyond fun -- it's an outright blast! It's kind of like one of those horrid 50's flicks -- ya know, something like ""Godzilla Ate the Blob and Tossed His Cookies on Tokyo"". Truly one of the worst films of all-time, one which I'm proud to admit I've watched at least a dozen times, Jaws 3 gets funnier with each viewing. It must be seen to be believed!"
1,Terrible. A very cheesy movie.,"Okay, as far as we know, great whites don't grow to 35 feet. Not to mention that the Florida waters are warm and whites don't like warm water. The plot was terrible and the effects were extremely cheesy. If you are into cheep, underwater thrillers, then go ahead and see this movie. I recommend that you do not. Waste of time and money."
1,Why did they even make this movie!,"For something like a week ago i rented this movie,and thats actully the worst movie i have EVER seen, me and my brother almost laught ourselvs to death.The shark doll they used in this movie can't even be compared with the shark they used in 1975.And all the credit i can give to this movie is the very very cool opening sequence.Morten Solberg Norway."
2,"Ok, but about the special effects........","Jaws 3 is about Sea World. Interesting. Jaws 3 doesn't seem to keep the plot as much as the 1st and 2nd. I would say it's ok, but it was lame (for a 13 year old or higher) and worse, what happened to the special effects? It looks like the shark is a drawing on paper, cut out and put onto the screen. (In some scenes) so does all the other special effects. I wouldn't suggest this movie if you want horror, or 3-D graphics. If your looking for any of those things, I would suggest the 1st Jaws."
2,NOT THE BEST!,"Jaws 3 can't beat Jaws1 and 2 but it is not that bad like Jaws 4. This shark thriller is about a killer great white swimming around in an water park(Sea World).Once the scientists there find out there is a shark terror begins.Killing,eating,and swimming.Can Jaws the Shark be stopped?Trust me don't see this just see part1 and 2."
3,"The Original is the Best By Far,But JAWS 3 is Next in Line.","The Original Jaws was the Best because of the 1st victim,Crissy,Alex the Boy in the raft and Quint which had the best shark attacks.Not to Mention, When Roy Sheider Blew up the shark.JAWS 3-D WOULD of been great had I seen it on 3-D where Jaws shatters the Glass and the sea tunnels.But was still good as JAWS3 because it took place on another location which was Sea World Florida.I wish there would of been more gruesome attacks like the guy who tried to fix the gate.That was by far the worst attack of any JAWS Film.I think that no other JAWS film can Compare to the Original JAWS.If I Had to list them in order,it would go , (1)JAWS the original,(2)JAWS 3,(3)JAWS 4 The Revenge,and (4)JAWS 2.Thats how I thought of the JAWS series."
1,ZZZZZ!,What a terrible movie. Looks like crap and the special effects are so lame you can only laugh. I thought Jaws 2 was bad but this is worse.
1,Very much eager to see this movie,"I am very much eager to see this movie. But unfortunately, still I have not received this Goods. It is the third time My orders are not reaching to me, and they will inform that they are sending again, but never delivered to my address. I am UNLUCKY to watch this movie."
3,A GOOD SEQUEL!!!!,"This is the most creative sequel! Here's how it goes: You have a base movie, you make a sequel almost exactly the same as your first installment, nobody complains. Then, take the premise, move it somewhere else, and make it bigger! In this case, somewhere else is Seaworld, Florida. And the shark is bigger, plus there's also an infant! Some of the action twords the end is very suspenceful (Royce in the filtration pump with the shark close behind). The problem as far as the shark is, that yes it's bigger, but it's slow-and dosen't think at all! The dolphins are cool, and the publicity coverage stuff is interesting. It's also cool to see the grown up Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) and Sean Brody (John Putch). The humor is good-some unintentional, and the setting is clostrofobic and fresh. A good movie that's got a bad rap."
3,Like All Movies And Love Horror Movies,1983 Jaws3D: Starring Dennis Quaid. The Great White Shark Kills Again And Again. But This Time It's At Sea World. Someone Left The Gate Open And The Great White Shark Showed Up For Hunger And Terror Beneigh The Ocean Floor. Then Mike Played By Dennis Quaid: Trys To Get Every One Out Of The Water As Fast As He Can Before The Mother Shark Shows Up For Him At The Tower In The Under Sea Kingdum. When The Mother Shark Comes He Yell's Out Shark!
1,Might have been nice in theatres,"Yes, this might have been good in cinemas with its 3D effects, but seeing it on video or shown on TV you realise that the 3D effects were the only thing worth going to see this mess for. The slow-moving plot is just a rip-off of Gorgo and the special effects are utterly laughable. Especialy ridiculous is the climax in which the mother shark's choppers fly towards the screen like the false teeth of some cartoon character. Utterly dire! The series should have stopped after the excellent Jaws 2 rather than dragging it down to this abominable level."
2,Dull sequel has some virtues like...,"Originality, music, and the fact that doesn't hurt the original(unlike Jaws The Revenge does by pointlessly killing off Martin and Sean Brody). Its been years since the 2nd Great White terrorized Amity. ""Mike"" Brody, the eldest of sheriff Martin Brody's sons works for Seaworld. Younger brother Sean(Who has aged about 12 years since Jaws 2!) comes to visit him and guess what..The Shark starts munchin'! The Shark has to create mayhem whenever the Brody's are around! Sequel is hurt by uninspired acting; ya just don't care about the characters. Still, MUCH better than Jaws The Revenge."
3,JAWS 3,"I had seen this movie many years ago in the theaters and it was originally 3-D but when they put it onto video/DVD it took away some of the exitment. I purchased this for my 9 year old son who is really into sharks and he has the other 3 Jaws movies-JAWS, JAWS 2, and JAWS the Revenge. If you are going to watch these with some small children, explain ahead of time how they make the movies and that it is all imaginated by the person who makes the movies because some of the seens can be kind of scary to some people if the don't know what is real and what is make believe."
3,"Well, at least we see a floating arm?","I saw this in the theater with my dad and brother. We had our 3-D glasses and we thought we were in for the thrill of a lifetime. Even at 12 I was scratching my head. I asked myself ""Did the shark just open up the cage with it's tail?""To make a long story short, a great white shark invades a Sea WOrld type amusement park. Check out the shark as it chases waterskiers in a show.The blond in this movie was pretty hot and I thought for years that the black guy was Lou Gosset Jr."
3,movie is dated and cheesey,"i gave this movie three stars because it deserves it. but one thing to remember is, it is old and it is in 3-D. of course the special effects are going to look shotty,especially in today's modern era where the effects are now more computer generated than anything else, but in its time the effects were perfect for this type of film. that's why you sit there wearing those annoying little red and blue glasses. remember, one must suspend belief when one watches a ""creature feature"" movie or any other of this type."
3,pretty good,"pretty good,the special effects i always wondered why they always looked like they were always coming at ya .and then i found out it was orignally in 3-D .i know why these big companys never realese 3d movies onto 3D on video or dvd!always people are like the 3d effects are bad and a waste.but you got to think that you cant get right to your face 3D action on a normal tv.like come on,i like any 3D i can get."
3,not the worst of the bunch,"These movies just get worse as they go along. The first is a cinematic masterpiece, the second was pretty good, this one was fair and the last is just god awful. I feel that some of the reviews are a little cruel. This movie is still a bit creepy but I think any horror movie that takes place in the ocean is alright. Anyway, the story sucks and the writers didn't get the facts correct (sharks swimming backwards?) but some death scenes were interesting. The transfer to DVD format hurts this movie because a lot of the climax is underwater at night so it's really dark and hard to see. The movie was originally released in 3-D so the effects look pretty hokey. This movie is enjoyable if you take it for what it is."
1,Movie Lacks Bite,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I only bought this DVD because I'm a completist. Originally released in theaters as 3D, the DVD is presented in 2D for some reason. The visuals look like someone put the film together using the MS Paint program on their computer. At times the shark actually looks as if it were cut and pasted on the background (and the shark itself screams ""fake""). Terrible special effects, subpar performances from actors you expect better from (I'm looking at you Louis Gossett Jr). Even the soundtrack is bad bad bad. I just don't know what Universal was thinking when it released this film. I've found it works best if you accept this film for what it is, an 80's ""killer shark run amok at the water park"" yarn and disassociate it from Jaws completely."
1,An ok film in 3D but a dud in 2D,I saw the movie when it came out in the theater in 3D and it was ok. Watching it in 2D on my television only shows how bad of a movie it really is. Don't waste your money on this dvd.
2,El Stinko,"Oh dear. This one lives up to the rep of a sequel. Contrived, stupid and just plain boring. This is a movie that invites headaches because of all the eye rolls. It broke the rule credibility rules. Not bent. Broke. I thought I had seen this one before and now I know why it wasn't memorable. Good acting, tho."
2,Should I be cheering for the shark?,"The first two Jaws films kept you on the edge of your seat, seeing the characters as real people, hoping they'll make it. However, in Jaws 3, I couldn't endear myself to any of the characters, so I actually was backing our angry shark. If that was the intent of the filmmaker, then success was achieved. However, hoping that a shark will devour your characters isn't really scary. It's actually like backing your favorite football team, hoping the players get as many yards and touchdowns as possible. If you're all for Team Shark, you'll be pretty satisfied. I was entertained, but not so much that I'd waste my time with another viewing."
4,Jaws 3 was much better than Jaws 2,"I'm surprised by the number of bad reviews posted here for Jaws 3. I've seen all of the Jaws movies many times and I my favorites are Jaws and Jaws 3. I thought Jaws 2 and Jaws Revenge were unbelievably stupid. Face it, the last half of Jaws 2 is basically just a bunch of screaming kids. Jaws 3 is entertaining just by the fact that it's filmed at Seaworld. It has many scary scenes and some cool effects. Namely, the part of the movie showing an underwater glass bottom walk-way of the theme park where people are walking and sharks are lurking nearby."
3,INTERESTING AS A FOLLOW-UP,"Well the two boys from the first two movies are now grown up.The bikini girls were kind of silly. But that is the guys for you.The theory of the shark show-up was probably plausible. Once again we have loads of miss-management that throws everyone's life into a bit of chaos.Who is the goofy gal that wants to keep a killer shark in captivity?There was some moments of fear when mama shows up - never did find out who took out the first guy.There was not enough emotional trauma on Mike's or his brothers part.But I will add it to my set with preferences to the first 2.Color and photography great - acting, as good as can be expected - Ah well, judge for yourself."
1,"honestly, who cares..............","a shark invading Seaworld, wow, were the writers on drugs? Bad acting, my McFarlane model looks better then the shark, and what the hell were these clowns thinking about? Possiblly the worst sequel except for Jaws the Revenge. What a fricking joke. This film proves, put the Jaws name on a poster and people will come, for like a week, this is a piece of crap. Ask Dennis Quaid, and the rest if they felt they put a great film out. They act as if if never happened, good for them, this movie needs to be flushed down a toilet, and soon, it really stinks."
1,What happened to the 3-D?,"I never understood why a DVD version of 3-D movies would be released without the 3-D. I mean, lets face it, this was always intended to be much more of a gimmick movie then it was about the continuing adventures of the Brody clan.I would pick this up in a minute if it was released as (maybe) a ""midnight movie"" with a pair of glasses and maybe a bag of popcorn or something. For a studio to roll this out there naked and expect people to buy it is just crazy. The movie stinks; it's simply not good enough to stand up on its on merit. Part of the reason people went to the theaters to see this was to catch it in 3-D; to take that away just doesn't make any sense. It was never meant to be without it."
1,They should've stopped at Jaws 2....,"Disgracing the Jaws franchise, this movie was incredibly poor. Jaws 2 was decent, but this movie was trying to milk the Jaws name of everything it had, and it looks like it was already dry. Atrocious special effects and bad acting are abundant in this film. It was meant to be seen in 3d, but since probably 1 in a billion Americans has a pair of 3d glasses, these '3d effects' are just painful to look at. The best that can be said is that it is remotely entertaining to watch if you are feeling lazy and want to stay in bed on a Sunday afternoon and you happen upon it on TBS or TNT."
1,2 Thumbs WAY Down,"I'm sorry, but I hate this movie. It's not scarey, the special effects were done to be seen in 3-D and look REALLY bad on a TV, the acting is substandard, and the plot is pretty dumb. If you're a Jaws fan, avoid this film. There is nothing here except an excuse to make a 3-D movie with a shark in it. One positive note for this film. It's not scarey so it's probably the best Jaws movie for kids"
1,"Very, very bad","Where do I begin? This movie was awful...I had morning sickness that wasn't this bad.If being a ""ham"" were an Olympic event, Bess Armstrong and Louis Gossett, Jr. would sweep the gold medals for this ball of cheese. Dennis Quaid would pull a close second for his amazing performance as a caring boss and drinking buddy/older brother. (Has Dennis Quaid been in a movie in which drinking wasn't his main talent?)Anyway, go to the beach, but stay away from this video."
1,I'm amazed,"Jaws 1 was a great movie....Jaws 2 still felt like a jaws movie because all of the original characters are there except for of course Quint and Hooper...But I am amazed at the ""good reviews"" this movie is getting!! The plot is silly ""MAMA IS MAD!!"" and the horrible special effects...a shark swimming backwards?? Throw this in the recycle bin and hit delete...this movie was embarrasing!!"
5,Jaws 3,Jaws 3 was a great movie!I think it is really cool how they based a shark movie on sea world. It makes it more realistic to happen. Even though you dont want people afraid to go into the water. I think it is better when you have a movie based on a real popular attraction like sea world. It would have been better if t he graphics were better.
2,Nothing Like the First Two,"I remember seeing this in the theater when I was a kid but spent most of it with the 3-D glasses off my face. So I rented it the other night just for kicks and wow what an awful movie. It has none of the man vs nature and man vs man moments like in the first two. The 3-D effects make it seem even more of a joke. They use old shark footage for some of the scenes which in no way matches the scenes they are being used for. Very blah all around with no really interesting characters. You don't care about any of them really. Badly written, poorly shot, and just mediocre acting. Don't waste your money or your time."
4,Better in 3D!,"I saw this in 3D when I was a kid and I remember it being much more scary back then. Not watching it in 3D is really lame although it's still better than ""The Revenge"" which is God awful.The spear gun part (in 3D) really freaked me out and still makes me cringe whenever I it today!"
3,"Well, it's not THAT bad . . .","The only things that are bad about this film are the over-the-top 3D effects used for the 3D theaters (the shark breaking the window, for example). Otherwise, this isn't really a bad film (You want bad? Watch the third Jaws sequel). The acting is only so-so, but who cares? The shark is what's the main attraction. There are tons of blood and gore (as much as there is in the first film), and the music is just as eerie and compelling. So it's not as good as the first Jaws, but at least it's more entertaining than Jaws: The Revenge."
3,Actually very entertaining in a comedic sense,"I will give this movie 3 stars because whenever I see it on one of my satellite channels I will watch it simply because I find it very amusing. It is not scary at all. The whole movie is just so bad that it's funny and entertaining.The acting is pretty good, and the characters are okay and somewhat likeable.The only scary part to me is when the people get trapped underwater in the tunnel and then the watertight doors close and the lights flicker on and off as the water is rising to chest level. Imagine being there! The people really seem terrified, and that is a very scary situation.Otherwise, the rest of the movie is entertaining in a silly sort of way."
2,A bad film.,Not a good movie. the only thing that makes it viewable is the performances by the actors like Denis Quaid. Recomondation: Avoid.
4,"The cast is good, but the shark can look stupid.",The shark look incredidbly unfake but slow. The only thing realistic besides the look is that it rolles it' s eyes over white when it attackes it' s prey. But what the movie lackes in the shark it regaines in the cast which deliveres an amazing performance.
4,Pretty good movie,I dont care what anyone says this is a good entry into the Jaws series. It isnt as good as the original but its a sequel what do you expect. By itself its a good scary movie and the shark is more real looking in this installment. The gore is definetly over the top in this one remember when the guy got stuck in the shark's throat. If you want something on par with the original sorry this aint the place but if your looking for a good horror movie this is for you.
2,Just a plain oh bad sequel !!!!!!!,JawsIII wasn't only a bad movie it was kind of boring. First of all there is no way a big 20 foot shark is going to fit inside the doors to get in Sea World. And like knowone would have noticed it in the tank before later in the movie. It was way to unrealistic and should never have been made just like so many other sequels. The story was dumb. Plain and simple. But the movie did have some interesting qualities to it. I liked how they brought back the Brody brothers. It took me at least 3 times to notice they were the Brody Brothers but hey it was cool when I did notice it. Also I did like how they did the ending. I won't spoil it if you have not seen it but it was kind of neat. To some up this lengthy review JawsIII was tolerable in some scenes but the movie itself was pretty unimaginable and DUMB!!!
3,Revenge of the Creature meets Gorgo,What does a studio do when they are out of ideas? Go back to the classics.The plot of this film is basically a combination of 2 old SCI-FI classics.Revenge Of The Creature 1955 and Gorgo 1961.The similarities are as follows:In Revenge Of The Creature the creature is captured and used as an exhibit in a theme park.In Gorgo a dinosaur is captured by a group of fishermen only to discover they have captured a baby and the mother is coming for it.Having said this I think Jaws 3 is a pretty entertaining movie.Not great but certainly better than Jaws 4 which was HORRIBLE!
3,JAWS THREE - DEEEEEE,"Jaws 3 was a unique jaws film. But i enjoyed it...Jaws 3 takes place at floridas Sea world, and Mike Brody,(now played by Dennis Quaid), is preparing to open an underwater tunnel. But when a diver goes missing, the girlfriend gets crabby and throws a hissie at Mike. So when Mike and his new love, (Bess Armstrong), go down for a look around the lagoon, they are attacked by a ten ft great-white. they capture it, and put it on display... but it subsequently dies. When the divers body is found, it is proved that the baby sharks mother killed the diver!!! She causes chaos throughout the sea world, but in the end she gets blown to bits by a hand grenade.Originally, this film came out in 3-DI enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who likes the first two JAWS films. Just forget jAWS 4 THE REVENGE was ever made.see ya, I'm going to watch JAWS III!!!"
2,Weak,"The bristles on this brush are weak, and permanently bend over after only a few uses. Buy a different brand of brush."
2,Not as good as other OXO brushes,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the bristles on this bend easily and crumple after just a few uses. I use my brush a lot and scrub pots and pans with it, this one is not appropriate for that type of use. They make another OXO brand brush with white handle and bristles (Can get at any major store) and it is much better. I don't see it on Amazon so I'll have to make a trip to the store for that one."
2,"I hope the brand was a warranty on the quality, it is not.","No way, this brush has a sturdy handle but ridiculous bristles.First this bristles are in too far rows, second the bristles are flimsy, in 45 days used to clean dishes before the dish washer, the item is to throw away.IKEA brushes for 1$ always lasted, at least, 6 months."
5,Great for awkward openings,"This is a great product to have for water bottles, travel mugs, coffee pots, etc. It's got a sturdy handle and the bristles are a nicely firm for cleaning in spots you can't get with your hand. I have these for my kitchen, my office (bowls, water bottles, coffee mugs) since they work so well. Price on Amazon is great too."
3,Downgraded from previous product,"The brush I received does not look like this. The one I had before was just like it, and was much better. The old one had a larger brush, better handle with softer area to place your fingers, and overall much better. I will keep this one that has smaller brush area, with blue bristles around the edges, but am disappointed in the change from what I thought I was getting."
4,A descriptive indepth book for D2k,"Aithough i haven't read through the full content so far it seems informative especially generation of forms.Key concepts have been well explained.As a Oracle consultant and having worked in many Oracle based companies like BellAtlantic,USXchange etc and having used designer 2000 for database generation for the past 8 months , i would recommend this book to all oracle designers /developer/Consulatnts and other IT professionalsRegards"
3,NOT SO BAD AS THEY SAY !,"What do you expect from an Arnold's movie ? A fantastic plot ? A screenplay without holes ? Great acting ? Come on ! This movie is fun to watch, a great entertainement."
2,Save your money...,I also feel ripped off after buying this DVD. The John Wu-like incessant gunplay adds nothing to this movie. And Swartzenegger takes himself way too seriously in a poor imitation of the Harrison Ford/Blade Runner role. The special effects are okay but nothing to write home about. Wait for this to come onto network tv where you will be spared the gratuitous foul language and sex scenes... and not have to waste your money to see it!
1,2 Hours of my Life I Will Never Get Back,"Hey, what is wrong here. Am I the only one that thought that this movie made me a little less intelligent when walking out. This was a special effects movie where the effects were not that special. As for acting, was there any? Does Arnold even speak English? His voice needs to be dubbed like in the good old days. The end was the only enjoyable part because this was where I was set free at last. This was over two hours of my life that I will never get back."
3,Gabriel vs. Movie,"I probably liked this movie only because I was concentrating on Gabriel Byrne's acting. (which was wonderful, compared to the screenplay he got to make something out of it). He does play a scary Satan (will only add to the ""brooding"" image he wants to get rid of so anxiously). The storyline is shallow and you get the feeling that they had ""fill up"" the movie with virtually unimportant bylines just to cut through the 2-hour standard. For those who want a truly enjoyable and intelligent Humans vs. Satan movie that has actually something to say to us, I would recommend you watch 'The Devil's Advocate'."
2,Gab you're the only good in this sh...film,Well what can I say? Arnie chasing the Satan with a 9mm? Well I don't think this is the movie we need! Who would believe that a man can just run away from the Devil and hide from it that easily? I mean come on! The Devil is not that easy to deceive. Ok Gabriel was great again I can say that. That is why this film is two not one star. Not even worth it to watch!
3,"Arnold, Please Stick to the One-Liners","Overall, an action-packed, special-effects packed movie. However, a little different than the typical Arnold movie. First of all, it's darker than most of his movies. Also, the movie tries to go a little deeper into Arnold's character than norm too. Big mistake. This requires ACTING. I'm sorry, Arnold just can't pull that sort of thing off. The combo of Arnold trying to do more than he can acting-wise, and some really bad overall dialougue makes for 2 or 3 points in the movie where there is unintended laughter. Not good. This time around, Arnold is fighting the Devil himself. How do you fight the ultimate bad guy? Well, of course, with bigger guns! But, if you like Arnold, and like big time special effects, it's cool."
4,One of Schwarzeneggar's better films.,"It was really intriguing and scary for the first 3/4 of the film, but then it just deteriorated into a blow-everything-up-and-empty-clips-into-this-and-that type movie.Still, A.S. played the role of a grieving, intelligent cop well.Gabriel Byrne was made to play Satan.If you're a fan of either of those actors or just an overall horror movie fan, it's worth buying or renting."
2,"This one was evil, all right...","I'm sure that this was designed to be a thought-provoking movie. Unfortunately, the only thoughts it provoked in me were to wonder how so much money could be wasted on such a bad movie. And it was BAD. Arnold Schwarzenegger is absolutely awful as Jericho, the Devil-killing bodyguard. Robin Tunney (the Devil's victim) looks clueless for most of the film. And Gabriel Byrne, as the Devil, just seems bored and mean. These aren't bad actors, either--I think that most of the fault lies with the script, which has cheesy lines and over-dramatic pauses. Plus, the action jumps from scene to scene so fast that it is often difficult to figure out what is going on--and this is hardly Shakespeare. Yuck. ""End of Days"" is only worth seeing to catch the special effects."
4,End of Days,This is an excellent movie with themes that run deeply into the fabric of today's declining moral and ethical society. This decline is hastening the end of days as we know it. Arnold Schwarzenegger is an actor who admirably carried this role to perfection.
4,"When the devil is here , who you gonna call ?","The devil takes the body of (Gabriel Byrne) to find his Pride while (Arnold)is trying to stop him ,you`ll notice how the devil is not just powerful with his magical power ,but with his mind power. An Action style movie which youll enjoy it with you DVD home theater system , lots of sound & visual effects . I recommend these movies if you like this one: Stigmata, The Devils Advocate, Fallen"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"When this film came out I thought great. I always been an Arnold fan, but boy was I wrong. I wasted 6.50 on a real sleaper. The only guy who made the movie ok enough not to snore in the theater was the guy who played satan. From the numerous things that made this movie sad was the Bible ignorance. The taking out of scriptures was real bad."
1,The embodiment of BAD,"Talk about every single element a movie can screw up on. All aspects were poorly executed. The script was full of flaws, and was bland and uninteresting. The acting was ludicrous. I love Gabriel Byrne and he did a decent job, but he doesn't save the movie. The directing was so horrible I was actually laughing. Cheap, lightning quick editing used in a completely wrong way. Peter Hyams's last film, 'The Relic', wasn't bad but seriously lacked. But this film is just awful. The special effects were ok for awhile, but they actually got worse as the movie progressed. There are a couple of good shots, but they are buried among a heap of complete idiocy. I'll never get those two hours back. Don't make the same mistake."
1,End of Days May Reflect End of Arnold's Career?,"This is one of the second worst Arnold movie I have ever seen - the worst being ""Last action hero"". Messy, senseless, illogical plot and gratuitous violence are major disappointments. Arnold has not put out quality film since T2 and True Lies. Don't bother with renting this film - just wait until it show up on HBO or Cinemax."
3,Governor of California V's the devil,"Arnie actually does a good job in this film of at least trying to act.The plot is a little ludicrous, the devil returning every 1,000 years to mate with a human to have diabolical offspring. But somehow it is still engaging.The special effects are good, especially the church scene at the end of the movie.Crucifixions abound and there is no shortage of blood splattered scenes for the more horror minded.There are absolutely no subplots involving any characters other than Arnie. Arnie's friensdhip with his co-worker is tokenistic and somewhat cliche.It could have been a very good film but ends up being a good ""b"" grade film - not the the huge comeback ""A"" grade block buster it was designed to be."
3,Could it be..SATIN?,"I've recently bought the End of Days DVD and watched it (of course) and became lightheaded. End of Days was a great movie, or least that was how they wanted it to be. Instead, the movie came to me as the exact same as every story told dealing with the ressurection of the devil. He must come to earth, kill many people for no reason, and impregnate one lucky lady to bear his devil-child. I don't know, but it seemed all to farmiliar to me. With that said and done, you must know that it wasn't a total bomb, it was good in some aspects; they told a story, but they told it good. With great special effects and a nice cast, the movie can really can reach to you and scare you at times, but I'm tired of always seeing the devil looking so smug and dandy..ahhh! The DVD feature menus are very well done, with some nice music for it, a plus on my board. But I suggest a definate rent on this one first."
4,interesting story,It's pretty good and i like how they explain the world doesn't come to an end for something stupid like it's 2000. You should see it.
2,Very disappointing...,"I'm a huge Arnold fan, but what a disappointment. Barely even good enough for a rental. If you have absolutely nothing else to do, you've read everything in the house and a friend just happens to stop by with this movie in hand, sure, go ahead and watch it. But it's not worth going out of your way. Sorry Arnold. You should have left this one for Steven Segal."
3,"Not what I expected, but better than I expected!","End of Days looked like a silly horror with Arnie trying to make a good comeback. But I was sort of wrong, I didn't totally enjoy this flick, it was a bit silly really, but a fun and sexy horror film away. The acting is absolutely terrible, but it is one of those lame movies that keeps you wrapped around its finger.Not only do we see the return of Arnold, but The Craft's Robin Tunney appears again to play a mentally challenged young lady who gets treated badly by the devil himself. Of course, Arnie comes to the rescue, but then he realizes he must take on Satan himself.End of Days is not exactly as good as I expected, or not like what I expected, but the film is good for those Arnie fans who want a wild rollercoaster ride!"
1,End of days,"I'm a big Arnold fan, It pains me to say this , but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was very formulaic, the characters lacked development, the special effects were old hat. I like to suspend reallity for a good sci-fi flick but this movie was entirely non-plausible from the very beginning. Had it not been for the audio effects that really shined on my home theater system, the movie would be better placed on mystery science theater. Dont waste your time, watch the weather channel this evening instead."
3,Surprisingly unhorrid,"Mildly better than the godawful Stigmata, but still a rather poorly thought-out story, neatly ripped off from earlier, better films such as Rosemary's Baby. However, Arnold was pretty good and Gabriel Byrne was excellent, and there was a lot of fire and explosions to distract from the plot holes."
1,Arnold at his best,"Another stupid movie, there is neither plot nor acting in that movie. Arnold made his work as usual, this to say like a man without brain who wants to destroy everything. The violence in that movie is gratuitous, if I were Swarzy I would retire immediately. You could see that movie as you eat a hamburger, it is the same product. To finish, i can say that Arnold destroys everything, include the cinema !"
3,ok...but arnold could do better,this movie was aight for the most part but arnold schwarzenegger could do a lot better. just look at some of his earlier pics like the terminator 1&2 and true lies. that's arnold at his best work. not trying to fight satan in a very disturbing picture that almost don't go anywhere plot wise but does have some very well done action sequences and special effects.
1,1 star is just enough,"This is one of the lousiest films Arnold has ever made! I usually enjoy his films, and because they are usually so ridiculous I find myself laughing more than being scared. *End of Days* was too pathetic to laugh; it was just plain stupid and gory - very gory. (Do not let children watch this!) As usual the script is lousy; special effects are nevertheless amazing.The only reason this film deserves one star is Gabriel Byrne: He was the perfect actor to play Satan.If you're looking for *T2* and the like, stay away from this. *End of Days* is in NO way similar to Arnold's previous films. If you want to waste your time, the way I did, take your chances and rent or buy this film."
2,ICK?,"Okay, I am not going to totally diss this movie. But personally, I hate movies with Arnoald what's a netor, or what... For the story line, and the very very neat graphics this was a let down. It was a little slow, and you had to dig to understand the stuff, and it's all church, stuff and things, and it was really kind of bad. For me, I didn't like it at all, But for other's they probally wouldn't mind. But if someone asked, I'd say... No, and that's what it's going to stay at."
2,Here we go again...,"The idea of satan's return to earth around new year 99/00 is very predictible. But the film actually got one high point, Gabriel Byrne's interpretention of Satan himself."
1,TERRIBLE--RUN AWAY!,"A complete waste of money, not even worth seeing. Not even worth one star--but Amazon.com doesn't give an option for no stars."
3,the govenor vs. the devil,"now the govenor of New York, Arnold, fights the devil in order to stop the end of days. who will win, well they both die, the govenor throws himself onto a sword and sends the devil(who took Gabriel Brynes body and played around with it) pack to the pits of hell. a good match but the govenor made the most punch. some suckerpunches along the way as well."
1,Worst Schwarzenegger Movie Since Last Action Hero,"This movie started OK and then degenerated into a bunch of Action/Horror cliches Which left me fast forwarding to the end. By the end of this movie you don't care if the good guy's win, or die."
5,A Very Godly Movie,"I don't know why the ratings were so low? Can they atleast focus on the message this movie is trying to explain. The writer wanted show about, that Satin uses tainted truths and preys on our weaknesses to destroy man from inside out! This movie is not mean't too be a violent money making, well digitaly comprised with lots of explostion effects. But i'm really glad that the movie was well acted & action packed & lots of blood witch help to bring the seriousness & spiritual depth too the movie!""Note to buyers"" If your a true christian you would be moved by this movie.""You your an Atheists. Forget it. You would hate this movie!"""
3,Arnold saves the world from the devil in 2000,"The 1000 years has past since Christian people thought the world would end in 1000 AD. Again it is predicted that the devil will spawn a child onan human woman and a new reign of evil will result.The cycle of the rings seems based on that same sort of legendin a world where superstitions ruled:The Lord of the Rings: Motion Picture Trilogy - Special Release: Tolkein Month Movies Poster Print, 27x40Instead of swords and arrows Arnold has an over and under grenade launchermachine gun.The special effects are pretty good, but the plot has been done several times before and after."
2,NOT ONE OF ARNIE'S BEST,"I had rather high hopes when I rented this DVD, but alas, the plot is silly, the acting (with the exception of Gabriel Byrne) is amateurish (sorry Arnie, but the hype of this being your most emotional role leaves me laughing) and the dialogue is embarassing. I'm only giving the film two stars because of the special effects, which alone make this turkey an interesting watch. A much better film in the same genre is ""Stigmata"". Hey Arnie, have you considered retiring and going into politics?"
2,Mind numbing,"The good news--a very nice DVD package, with excellent picture and sound quality, with lots of extra features. The bad news--who cares? Its mindlesss, souless excess, without a single creative idea in evidence. I don't expect intellectual inspiration from an Arnold movie, but one should at least get some great action sequences and something approaching continuity in the story. Gabriel Bryne, Robin Tunney, and Rod Steiger are all fine in poorly written roles. But this movie makes MTV videos look substantial in comparison."
2,Bear witness to the end of days.,"In 1999 , a prophecy is fortold that the dark angel is loose from his prison.But leave it to the hero to challenge satan.In the ultimate war of good vrs evil.A very rugged Arnold who is battling personal problems diffrent than anything hes ever done,but a lack luster script and formula action kills this movie off.Good options but you don't just get a movie for the options just not one of his best but a fun movie to watch rent it don't buy it."
4,"A fun, thriling, and all around good movie",This film is a interesting and action packed. It it is based aroud a interesting idea and was a all aroud fun movie to watch I recomend it for any DVD library.
2,Pitiful.,"This movie was just that, pitiful. With Arnold and Gabriel Byrne, and an obviously large budget, this movie should have rocked. The acting was embarrassing. Arnold can defeat the devil? Rent this movie before you buy it."
3,Nothing special!,"Arnold Schwarznegger is pretty decent in a movie which is a cross between Terminator and the Excorcist. The visual effects ar pretty good and the action sequences are loaded to the max. However, there are way to many one liners. One liners are good in action movies such as Terminator; however, in a movie about armagedon they become trite and silly."
2,Derivative and routine,"OK, I finally saw it on cable. Yuck. Though I only have myself to blame if I'm surprised it's bad. The movie makers tried to cash in the apprehension some Religious Right nuts tried to create concerning the Millennium. In a sense, this movie was inevitable. What a story line. It's derived from countless other movies. I was going to list some, nbut there are just too many. Mostly fair acting. Arnold was flat, as usual. Tunney? Eh. She's a cutie-pie with a nice chest. That's about it. Byrne, though, was quite good as Satan. I especially enjoyed the conversation between Byrne and Arnold in Arnold's apartment. It warmed my atheistic heart. Maybe that was the movie's high point. Heck, I can see myself watching it quite often when there's no actual good stuff on TV. (...)"
5,Brilliant !,"A great action flick with many scary scenes. Your girlfriend/wife will be cuddling up with you for this one. Excellent action and great acting by Gabriel Byrne (playing Satan). What a great film. A must see for anyone old enough for the R-rating due to the graphic violence and other adult content. Arnold does it again, and proves (not that he has to prove anything to anyone) that he truly is the all-time king of action movies."
3,"We won't never forget you, Jesus. We always believing you.","This movie is bad, But is still good alittle bit. I hate those demons. Satan is so far of these people turn to evil. arnold can handle those suckers in new york city. He is so smart to kill demons. We will never forget what Jesus farther say about the truth. But don't worry, Arnold will kick Satan ass."
1,"Let's hear it for Arnie. I said hear it, not spear it.","You have as much chance of urinating against the side of Voyager Two than winning the national lottery. Never the less, my mate Nigel 'spunky' Turner says that when, not if, he wins it he will buy a copy of every great film Arnold Schwarzenneger has made over the last thirty years and then buy himself a large country estate to put them all in. Well, that takes care of the doorstop......"
4,"Not great, though not bad either","End of Days brings to the screen the story of an alcoholic, down-on-his-luck, former cop who joined a private security firm that offers wealthy people protection. Things become rather complicated when the client in need of protection is... Satan.There are slight hints of the Omen, Constantine, and Ninth Gate with a touch of the X-Files so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller/horror type of category.Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney, and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good.In short, End of Days is a movie worth watching if you are in the mood for some good entertainment and/or you are a Schwarzenegger fan. 4 Stars"
3,Just B-A-D! So why give it three stars?,"I give the film three stars for Gabriel Byrne. He's the person who keeps the film going, even at it's REAL bad points. He gives us a believable performance as Satan and is a pretty cool one, too: ""...you don't want to see me mad...""Arnold obviously thought this was a good ol' action film to come back to -- but it wasn't an action film. It was a cheap 'end-of-the-millenium-what's-gonna-happen?' film that is SO unbelievable, it's almost not worth watching.Rent, don't buy it. And if you do rent it, rent it for Gabriel Byrne."
1,Another Formulaic Ahhnuld Movie,"After losing $7 and two hours of my life seeing this at the theatre it is time to get petty revenge/vent. This movie contains another typical ""action"" plot that is predictable and full of dull characters. This can be balanced out with great action which this movies lacks. The acting is...well nevermind. The dialogue is unintentionally funny, but that does not justify owning this movie. The real tragedy here is Gabriel Byrne, who is the man, in a horrid movie. If you really NEED to see a supernatural type of movie see The Sixth Sense again or take a nap. To sum it up over the hill action hero, bad script, no action, good trailer and marketing= every bad HOLLYWOOD movie. On the plus side the explosions sound good."
4,"Yet again, a good suspense flick ruined in the end.","Like House on Haunted Hill, End of Days is a terrific combination of suspense and thrills that is sacrificed in the end for cheesy special effects that do nothing to help the main plot along. Old Arnold plays Jericho, a former cop who learns that Satan has come back to impregnate a woman and begin the end of days. He seeks the woman out, only to find that Satan, played by Gabrielle Byrne, has turned all of his friends into workers of hell. The suspense builds throughout the movie, yet the ending scene in which Jericho and Satan have their final showdown brings the movie down from its status of thriller to cheeser. Gabrielle Byrne deserves credit for playing Satan in this movie and a priest in Stigmata. Rent it before buying please."
5,Excellent Satanic Movie,Well written and Scharzenegger at his best! The devil and the the church exorcisms were believable. Constantine is better but this is not a bad alternative. I was throughly entertained of the events and the storyline of this movie.
2,Satan gets blowed up real good,Comparing the Exorcist to this movie is like comparing Laurence Olivier's Hamlet to Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla. Interesting that so many people applauded Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of Satan. How would they know? Perhaps this movie appeals to satanists. One particularily disturbing scene has Satan apparently urinating on the streets of New York. This would explain a lot if you've ever been there. Two stars for some mildly amusing special effects
3,End of Accuracy,"Typical Schwarzenegger action movie. Plot based on the threat of Satan gaining control over earth - from Revelation 20:7, which says Satan will be freed after 1000 years. Somehow script decides that's a thousand years from 999. Also, script ignores Revelation as it goes on to say Satan will be freed only briefly before being returned to his prison in a lake of burning sulfur. Obviously, can't expect too much accuracy here, but when movies use biblical references, I'm always more satisfied if the story fits with more than one verse at a time."
3,Forget The Critics!,"When I first bought End Of Days,I thought it was going to be bad, giving that movie critics panned it when it was out in thearters.Boy,I was surprised!It's a creepy,dark Arnold action/horror flick that got great,if not exactly mind-blowing,special effects and heart-pounding scariness to go with it.Sure the plot is silly(Arnold vs.the Devil),the acting isn't great,but hey-it's prime Ar-nuld!Also,give the guy credit for trying to be somebody more human(a down-and-out cop named Jericho) than his usaul larger-than-life,man-of steel action hero self!Even when Arnie gets a little ridiculous when he trys to cry or asks for God to ""give me strength""(!).Gabriel Byrne does a fine,menacing turn as you-know-who,while Robin Tunney does a histronic,overwrought turn as Satan's would-be bride Christine York!All n' all,a fun roller-coaster ride of a DVD!"
2,"Arnold is not ""bahhck"" with this film.","End of Days is one of those bothersome, tiring films that take a cliche and ride it for all its worth. In the meantime, viewers are subjected to a bad, done before script,hammy acting, and violence out the wazoo! I had some higher hopes for this film ( at least as far as you can hope for with a Schwarzenegger film)as the trailers made it look like he was typed a little bit out of cast. But as soon as Arnold has to save Robin Tunney from the the incarnation of the Devil ( played very badly by the usually enjoyable Gabriel Byrne), he turns back to the action hero everyone loved before his surgery sidelined his career. Ultimately, it is a predictible film at best, and one that won't put Arnold back on the map. Oddly enough to mention in a review of a movie such as this, I would recommend instead the very cute Jingle All the Way for a different side of Mr Pumping Iron!"
3,Worth a Watch...,"This movie has some problems, but it is entertaining enough to watch once. First of all, Arnold is a better action star than he is an emotional character, that's one thing that doesn't work in this movie.This movie has a classic, theme: good vs. evil, which has been done to ""death."" This movie pulls it off pretty well, with a cool villian (the devel, you can't get much more evil than that.)The action is good, the acting is not, the story is good, the side love story is really not. Overall, this is a movie worth your time, and the DVD is packed with nice features!"
2,Takes itself much too seriously (SPOILER IN LAST PARAGRAPH),"This film is much too dark and serious for its own good. Nobody is happy, nobody smiles, and just about everybody dies with gratuitous gruesomeness. The only one who seems to have any fun at all is Satan!The effects, video and audio are no less than you would expect from a big budget thriller, but don't even bother trying to think about the storyline. The DVD itself is impeccably presented, with plenty of goodies.But Arnie, Arnie... what were you thinking? What -- no one liners, no humour, and you actually buy it at the end? What happened to your superhero powers? Sorry, but this is not how I like my Arnie movies. Mindless I don't mind (so to speak)... but a FUNLESS Arnie movie? No thanks."
4,The Devil Made Me do it,"End Of Days DVDEnd Of Days starring Arnold Swarzennegger playing a cop turned security guard seeking to prevent a diabolical plot for Satan to mate with a human. Great special effects.Recommended for Arnold Swarzennegger fans and fans of action movies.Gunner December, 2007"
3,"Schwarzenegger's late nineties comeback,",End Of Days was billed as Schwarzenegger comeback after the misstep of a movie Batman & Robin. While Schwarzenegger is good in the film Gaberial Byrne has the most fun as the devil. Robin Tuney does good in her first female lead and Kevin Pollack gives some one-iners. Peter Hymas has made a okay film with enough action to please the Schwarzenegger fans.
3,Eh.....its entertaining if there is nothing better on TV,"This review is for the HD DVD version of this film.......Overall the movie is just OK. Like the title says, its entertaining if there is nothing better on TV. I bought the HD DVD version after not seeing this film for nearly 8 years. Too bad i didnt rent this before buying it. lol The HD DVD version is pretty good for the quality but the film itself is lacking. This is ment for only those who are die-hard Arnie fans...."
4,Why did everyone hate this film?,"I thought the story was pretty good and Arnold's acting was pretty good, Gabriel Byrne did a pretty good job. The only acting that I didn't like was Robin Tunney, she was kinda annoying. Other than that I thought it was a good comeback for Arnold cause he actually played a vulnerable character instead of the regular action hero he usually plays. So I actually enjoyed this movie, it's not one of his greatest movies like Terminator 2: Judgement Day but I thought it was pretty entertaining, check it out and if you want to talk movies with me my e-mail is ..."
4,pretty good,"i actually enjoyed watching this movie, arnold said that he needed a role where his character was more complicated and this movie is like that becuase the story is not real simple when he goes up against satan and he is a drunken cop coping with his wife and kids death and then having himself caught up in this mystery of satan being released from his prison and has to save the girl that was chosen by satan, not a big exposive acton movie like one of a typical arnold flick but its a very good suspense thriller worth the watch."
3,"Amusing and entertaining, to say the least.","It's Arnold vs. the Devil! That's all you need to know plot-wise in this big and dumb action/thriller that pits Schwarzennegger against the ""ultimate"" villain. Yes, this one's as stupid as you'd expect, but there's a certain acknowledgement of its own inanity, the action's fast-paced and exciting, and there are plenty of good, intentional laughs (The one-liners and an unforgettable fight between Ah-nuld and an old lady!). Not necessarily better than what the critics say (at least in terms of the script), but it sure is entertaining (for mostly the right reasons, I assume)."
2,Dead in the water...,"I was disappointed with the big man on this one. I really feel that 'Raw Deal' will hold up better to repeated viewings than this mess. I guess that this belly flop of a movie can only guarantee that Ahhhnold's next movie will be better.. T-3, anyone?"
2,End of Logic but some great effects,"I rented the DVD version of this film with the thought that this would be a bad movie and realizing that I would not agree with any message that the filmaker was trying to say about God and Satan and how the ""End of Days"" will really happen. With that in mind, I can say that the movie was still pretty cheesy. I understand that with Arnie films, you need to suspend some logic but this really went over the top. I will also agree with another reviewer in that this film is not for children ( or teens ) since there are some disturbing imagery. I will say though, that my 5.1 speaker system got a great workout. And the effects were pretty good."
4,who doesn't love a good vs. evil film?,"the story has been done many times, but the things that made this a good movie for me are the following:gabriel byrne is so hot as the devilarnold uses many profanitiesi always love gabriel byrne's performances and who doesn't love to hear the governor of california drop the f bomb. i think i would have given this movie 5 stars if we had seen more of the devil."
3,End of Genre,"If you are expecting something like ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Exorcist"", then you will be dissapointed. It fails to bring something new to this supernatural genre. Though the film is by itself quiet entertaining, still you can see the desperation in the director to make it a usual Schwarzenegger ""run to the mill"" action flick. Gabriel Bryne is the best part of the movie. The movie is worth watching just because of Gabriel Bryne."
3,Not the best Arnold Movie,"End of Days is an ok Schwarzenegger movie but this movie is not the best in the Arnold franchise. Gabriel Byrne gives a great performance, and there are some cool special effects. The story is a little weak though. I would recommend renting this before making a purchase unless you are a diehard Arnold fan."
3,End of Days,"Pretty good flick, of course you have to put up with Arnold's inability to speak ENGLISH and his constant grunting and groaning, but its a decent flick.I'd pay a dollar to watch it but not much more."
1,what is the point?,"What's the point of making yet another ""Satan's child"" movie, painstakingly weaving a travesty, shot by shot, scene byscene, from the multitude of other just as faceless and ephemeral films? Whatever it is, it is not an artistic one. And Iwasn't expecting much, just a good action flick with some originality and humor. But they couldn't accomplish eventhat. Ah, as a guy once said, what's the use... Memorable moment: Arnold is fighting an elderly Italian woman."
1,End of Careers,"Robin Tunney has great legs, wow has she grown up. That's about all this horribly contrived movie is worth."
3,Arnold vs. Satan!,"Come on people who didn't like this film!This is good ol violent n' cheesy Arnold fun!We've had: Arnold vs. The Predator, Arnold vs. Martians, Arnold vs. T-1000, Arnold vs. Fat guys in suits, now Arnold vs. Satan!Its been awhile since we had a Arnold vs. Somthing flick and I'm glad he's back.This time Arnold is a lousy drunk who is protecting a girl from Satan. Yep, this means lots of people are gonna die and Arnold is gonna kick some a$$. Overdone production and cheesy dialog make this a must see if you feel like turning your brain off for an evening.Its not as good as Predator or Total Recall but its still good. Only thing is it lacks that good story quality most Arnold vs. X films have, this film is pretty predictable.But still... its Arnold..."
1,"A Twisted, Evil, Mess","I wouldn't give this any stars.This film is offensive, indecent, and harmful, and shows a disgraceful lack of knowledge and understanding.Anyone who has any respect for God or for goodness should avoid watching this film. The explicit scene where Satan is having sex with a man's wife and daughter at the same time, whom he has possessed to lie with him, is just one example of what you shouldn't allow yourself to suffer seeing."
2,Unholy Mess,"First of all, I had assumed the movie I was seeing was the film rendition of Dennis Daver's fine novel of the same name. Alas, it was a hokey, rambling, unrealistic journey about prophecies and the Catholic Church and a lot of mumbo jumbo psychobabble.Arnold was...well, Arnold. He can occasionally shine (""True Lies"") but usually one gets a stilted, linguistically challenged portrayal of the same type character. In this he falls somewhere in between...as does the movie. You know from the first five minutes how it will end and while it is easily as good as most of the other tripe that passes for cinema these days, it is typical fare. Best time to see - when snowed in with nothing to do all day."
1,Y2Klunker,"Absolutely terrible film. Hyams is normally a great director, but he should have seen the stink of this ugly film a mile away. Schwarzenegger's efforts to act border on the comical, and the rest of the cast has nothing to do but stand around and either die or make deals with Satan. I hope no one's soul is in jeopardy after this junk."
4,Blu Ray Review,"I was half expecting the Blu Ray version of End of Days to *suck* but suprisingly it is one of the best in terms of picture and sound transfers. I am only using a Samsung HD Ready LCD.For a late 90's movies it has very good picture quality-: during the night scenes, you don't see grains on the dark background. Sound is also superb. The only thing that *SUCKED* is the extras. Only a director's commentry, nothing else.So if you are an Arnold Fan and hate 'extras' get EOD on Blu Ray :)"
1,If only there were a zero-star rating . . .,"I saw this . . . thing in a theater long ago, an ugly day which I have tried to blot from my memory. I didn't expect great filmmaking, it does have Scharzenegger, but I convinced a friend that it might be worth the time and money, if only for entertainment.Words cannot express the loathing I feel for this monstrosity. If censorship were a live option, I would advocate it simply to get the thing off the market. It is useless to attempt to describe its bad features, since that would imply that there are good features distinguishable from the bad. Let it suffice to say this: so far as I can recall, this was the first and only time a movie forced me to get up and leave the theatre. I don't know what's wrong with the people who've given it five stars, and I don't want to know. But I was so dismayed by their approval of this garbage that I felt some sort of corrective was in order. Hopefully, this review will suffice for that purpose."
1,A very bad movie,"This movie has great special effects, lots of gratuitous sex and violence but the plot is predictable. Good acting and great special effects cannot rescue this script. The most important part of any movie is the story. Hollywood producers seem to have forgotten this."
5,one of arnolds best,I just love this movie i think it one of arnold best since terminator 2.this movie is about a wonan who is suppted to bring a bout the end of days if the deivel makes love to her but the only person that can protect her is arnold who as a bruned-out new york cop.this is a very goog which has a lot of action just like arnold other movie.dont listen the cricts on movie{who that that this movie was BAD}thay dont know what thay are talking about.buy or rent this movie today.
2,awful movie,"End of Days - I just bought this movie on DVD and I feel so ripped off - the movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen (Arnie is ok) - the girl in it is awful, Arnie's friend in the show is awful. Gabriel Byrne isn't convincing as Satan and corny lines are just out of place - the subwoofer works well on numerous occasions and visually it's ok, but the plot is bad, the script is worse and the acting is ridiculous - reminds me of cheesy low budget acting.save your money, please."
1,one of those movies that twists religion.,This movie is totally ridiculous. A burned-out cop (Arnold) with little or no faith stopping the devil who seems to have a Y2K plus a girl problem? hollywood movies like this is another perfect example of twisting biblical text to wow an unwary audience. A totally disappointing experience. Mediocre acting combined with a pseudo-religious plot equals another movie flop.Watch Last Action Hero instead...that was a far better movie than this.
1,What can I say?,"I wish that I could give this cd a good review, but I can't because they sent the wrong cd in the case."
3,"MIRRORS ARE GREAT, BUT ...","The mirrors are excellent, but the sturdiness of the plastic support when attaching the item to a wall mirror are a little awkward and not totally secure."
5,Brave Combo,"Check out Brave Combo on Sarah Hickman's new cd ""Best of Times"". The album also features Willie Nelson and Robert Earl Keen and is now available on iTunes.[...]"
5,Epson's Perfect Photoi Scanner,"Exceeds my expectations, both in ease of use and quality of output. I haven't yet used it for scanning slides and negatives, but look forward to the experience. Incidentally, I'm using it with Photoshop CS2 rather than the provided version."
1,Garbage - eternal driver problems,"Sorry to have to write this, but I have never ever wasted as much time on any product as I have on my Epson scanner. You install it, it works for a while, and then magically disappears so no apps will recognize it. This has happened on multiple systems, so there is a flaw at their end, not just one configuration file on one PC. Even EpsonScan does not recognize it. This is with the most current drivers off the web and following the install instructions to the letter."
1,Watch out for film deposits under the glass!,"My six months old 4990 has a noticeable film deposits under the glass. The glass was clear when I bought it. Apparently other owners of the 4990 have had identicle problems (discussions at howtofixcomputers.com). Epson will clean it for free if the 4990 is still under warranty, but this is not a one time problem, but a continuous one (you have to pay Epson to clean the glass after warranty expires). The film is visible when the 4990 is powered up and the interior light is on. With the lid out of the way, look at the glass at 10 to 30 degrees angle. I hope your glass is clear."
5,Epson minus Canon=New Top Of Line Scanner,"With the discontinuation of Canon's popular and highly rated Canoscan 9950 F, the Epson 4990 is by default the new flatbed color scanner champ. I don't think I'm just going to wait while Canon gets around to coughing up a new and persumably better successor to the 9950 F. What arrogance! I'm switching to Epson today.Canon=STUPID."
5,Worth the price twice over,"After doing a lot of research on which scanner would be the best for our photo-archiving project, I settled on the 4990 because of the great feature set and the consistently high reviews. After playing with my machine for about a month now, I believe that not only is the 4990 a great tool on its own, but the software that accompanies it is, alone, well worth the price that I paid for both hardware and software. The only downside is that the edition of Photoshop Elements is 2.0 instead of one of the more recent releases. Still more than powerful and useful enough for the amateur photo-archivist."
2,Poor Performance,I bought this scanner for scanning x-rays & slide films. It does a very poor job of doing both. The software is very primative with few options. I see no difference between the quality & performance of this scanner as compared with one that you would pay $99 for.
2,Noisy scanner,"This scanner did several transparencies very well. When we tried a regular scan, the belt made a harsh grinding noise. The office directly across from mine even commented on hearing it. The weird thing is that with this terrible noise is that the scan was great. If you can handle a loud, grind...great pick-up."
1,bait and switch,"I looked up this product on google (epson 4990 scanner) and the ad from amazon said espon 4990 PRO for 398.99 with free shipping. I click it on and get directed to buy a non-PRO version of the 4990 with no free shipping. bummer, bought it somewhere else."
4,Epson Perfection 4990 Scanner,"Excellent photographic quality, even from 135mm negs. It is s-l-o-w, though. That's the trade-off for high-resolution, high D-max scans. I work on a Frontier lab scanner for a living, and the 4990 blows it away, except for speed."
4,Nice step up,"I've used plenty of Epson scanners before but this one does top the cake. It turns out beautiful scans of photographs and does an amazing job with 35mm slides and film negatives.I would have given the scanner a 5 star rating except that there were a few issues. The first is that a high end scanner such as this should have a Firewire pass through so that it can be part of a longer chain of devices. Secondly, I'm using the scanner on a Mac OS X machine and the software took a few tries before the entire package loaded. I also get some ""application unexpectedly quit"" when quitting out of the application. Lastly, although the results of the 35mm slide scans were fantastic getting up and running was a little less than intuitive.If you want a great general purpose photo scanner, don't hesitate on this one."
3,"Fits over everything, but lacks side coverage","I wear an armored TourMaster jacket while on my motorcycle, and this vest fits over it very well, but I had to cut or tie up the various straps to prevent them from flapping. While this vest is bright and will attract a lot of attention, it is important to note that it has no reflective coverage on the sides. Also, I wish I could remove the identity card holder because I don't use it."
4,D Windorf-P Stanley progenitor on vox; G Funk fellow travele,"Music from the very brief period (late 1969-early 1970) where psych rock was turning into hard rock, and albums had elements of both. ""Dead Man"" is a heavily Grand Funk-influenced (I mean the ""good"" Funk here, not the post-1971 ""good time"" Funk junk) epic that is an immediate hard rock classic. I gave this four stars only because several songs appear in two versions on the CD, and for the most part (except maybe the two versions of ""Dead Man"") the differences between versions are too small to justify the duplication. But that's a minor quibble. There ain't a bad song here."
3,U-Boat 977 takes you right into a submarine captains life.,"From the back cover:They were the grey wolves of the third reich. Deadly and incredibly cunning...they were invincible. The German U-Boats of WWII were the most feared arm of Hitler's navy reaching out into the Atlantic to wreak havoc and destruction on the Allied convoys. Now a U-Boat captain who survived it all tells what it was like from the German side; the below-zero watches on the ice-encrusted bridge, the daring attacks on whole Allied convoys, the incredible escapes. Heinz Schaeffer rose from midshipman in the all powerful U-Boat fleet to captain of one lone grey wolf trying to escape the Allied Navy."
4,Agreement with Monsarrat,"The intro by Monsarrat contains the statement ""No one save a power maniac, a sadist, or a nautical romantic can hold any brief for submarine warfare. It is a repellent form of human behavior"".How true. In recent years it has become popular to idolise the role of a U-Boat Captain. Whilst taking nothing from them from life within the confines of an 'iron coffin', it was one thing to match wits with a surface warship and a very definite other, to sink defenseless merchant ships without warning. That did not take courage or bravery to accomplish. This is from one who was on the receiving end of a tin fish."
3,The last U-boat surrenders.,"I must admit that I have never heard of this story before. I heard about a U-boat leaving the Baltic Sea at about the time Hitler killed himself, but the story about the U-977 is amazing. Not only did she break the blockade, but surrendered to the Argentines in August of 1945. This boat had little fuel, but some provisions, and an understrenght crew. The author relates his own training in this book and then details this amazing journey.This is a nice little true story about World War II. It reads like a novel, but the author relates this is all true. It is a different story than one usually finds about WWII."
1,NOT for serious actors,"I ordered this book in hopes of finding what it promised...some fresh new material that could possibly give one ""an unfair advantage"" in the audition process. In spite of a few negative reviews I'd read on these pages, I chose to believe the positive ones because I had some important auditions coming up and I WANTED this book to be all it promised. I NEEDED it to be ~~ and it wasn't. I eagerly read every single piece and there was not one monologue appropriate for or worthy of a serious adult actor or actress, no matter what his or her level of experience. These might be ""okay"" for introducing high school students to drama. But with all due respect to Pierce and Onorato, as an acting teacher as well as performer, writer, and director, I just couldn't justify asking a student of ANY age to chose to commit to any of this material over the works of some of our great - and even not-so-great - playwrites."
1,False Advertising!,"The colors of this cutting board are NOTHING like the picture, instead it consists of muted green and blues -- very dull -- instead of the vibrant oranges and purples which were apparently enhanced to promote false advertising."
3,Not as pretty as the picture; disappointed,"I thought the cutting board would show vivid shades of green and display the leaves clearly. Instead, the whole thing is very muted and dull. I'll use it as a cutting board, but I won't be displaying it the way I have displayed my old one with daisies."
5,Even nicer looking when you see it yourself!,"My uncle is a chef (really a cook) and an avid outdoorsmen. I was so happy to see this gift. I thought it would be perfect for him. He had an early Christmas with us so unwrapped it yesterday. He made a big deal about it and seemed to really like it. He said he would definitely use it. It comes in a nice box and lookes too nice to be a cutting board, but I know my uncle will use it. He seemed honestly pleased with it."
5,Great oriental decorative ideas for Obi use!,I have read this book and we used it to fashion Obi for display a recent retirement party at our office. The retiree loved the colorful displays and we were then inspired to use Obi in our home decorating. This book is a great resource if you love to use Oriental touches in your home decor.
2,"Lame, c-grade ACDC crap","Great cover, but that's it. Nothing electrifying or rising above decent and ""nice try"" status. Get the 1st LP and continue with BREAKER on. A cute record if nothing else."
3,Introduction to Behavior Therapy for the general public,"Explains the basis and methods of Wolpian behavior therapy, and gives case examples, in terms accessible to the average person."
3,Memory Card from RedHotBuys,"My memory card came very late, way after the estimated arrival date. However the person to email on the other end for redhotbuys was very good he made sure to ship it again and made sure i got it. I got it the day before i needed it. They were in the middle of switching shipping companies. I was pretty sore about this order in the end."
5,I think that these music included CD are real hard rock.,"This CD would remain forever Rainbow as a legend of hard rock band. Especially, I love the power ballad ""Can't Let You Go "". Listen it !"
3,Taste of Things To Come,"More melodious and less speed-driven than previous Rainbow albums, this one offers a preview of reconstituted Deep Purple. It sounds a lot like ""Perfect Strangers"". Lots of DP fans turn their noses up at untempered Blackmore, but there's a lot to be said for melody-driven hard rock. Maybe not a very inspiring album, but very solid work nevertheless."
4,Highly recommended!,"I've just bought this cd, and I like it very much. My favorite songs on this album are: 'Fire Dance' and 'Drinking with the Devil'. The rest of the songs are very good also. The songs 'Anybody there' and 'Snowman' are instrumental. I dont like that. 'Anybody there' is okay, but 'Snowman' is just boring. But the rest of the songs are very good. 'Street of dreams' became a great hit. I have to say that I like 'Straight between the eyes' better than this album. But that doesn't mean that I dont recommend this album to you! If you are a Rainbow fan, you must have this album. Highly recommended!"
3,Rainbow rocks,"Rainbow never fails to impress, and this album is no exception. This is the third and the last album of the Joe Lynn Turner era. It's not as good as Difficult to Cure or Straight Between the Eyes, but its got some good songs on it that make it worth the purchase-Standed, Can't Let You Go, Desperate Heart, and Street of Dreams but none of the others really stand out. If you're not a diehard fan and you already have their greatest hits, you can probably pass on this one."
3,Ritchie reached the end of the Rainbow.,"Rainbow ""Bent Out Of Shape"" #34 (1983).Rainbow's 7th and final studio album ""Bent Out Of Shape"", is a hard album to like, it has some good moments, but the flow really sucked. Produced by Roger Glover this album just has to many misses than hits. On the hits side we get the album opener ""Stranded"", with some smoking guitar by Blackmore. ""Can't Let Go"", is another winner. ""Street Of Dreams"", #60 hot 100 and #2 MSR, which was kind of like ""Stone Cold"", the year before and ""Desperate Heart"", a solid little number. They brought in ex-Brand X drummer Chuck Burgi on this release, Chuck would later appear with Blue Oyster Cult in the 90's. Rainbow had a good 9 year run, but Deep Purple was reforming in late '83 and release their comeback album in '84."
4,An underrated masterpiece,Bent out of shape is one of the best albums from the Joe Lynn Turner era and is one of the best albums due to their superb songs.Highly recommended.
5,Rainbow Always Rocks,"This one is among my favorites. R. Blackmore was, is and will be always the best in all times. It is sad that R. Blackmore is out of rock music."
1,THE BOTTOM.. Look at the lyrics !,"I dont'know how it happen, but Blackmore allowed singer Joe Lynn Turner to take complete control of the song's themes, and we Rainbow fans were obligued to hear lousy tittles as ""Can't let YOu Go"", and other titles that seem more like Poison. Turner always wanted to sing this horrible lyrics (he did it again when singing for Malmsteen in ""Odyssey""). Sad !"
3,Expected better,Neat idea and I like their size. I probably should have read more details on it but I didn't realize it was only one mount when I bought it so I needed to go back and buy another one. Just tried installing them only to realize the hardware kits from the two mounts was different and the hardware is *incredibly* weak (stripped both screws without even noticing.
4,"Works alright, difficult to secure position","I got this because my NHT Super Zeros have a pre-threaded insert for them. They work okay but the screw to tighten the position of the speaker is hard to reach because its directly behind the speaker. It will help if you have a long hex key, preferably one with a T handle. Otherwise, the position will slowly slip."
3,Two issues,"1) If you're not screwing into a stud, the anchors that ship with the product are pretty useless. I ended up going to the hardware store. While not a huge expense, it's frustrating to discover inferior parts for something that ain't cheap.2) My speakers are 8.5 lbs. Because of the assembly, you must tighten the ball joint after attaching the speaker the arm. This setup affords a very tough angle to get leverage to tighten the joint. I ended up with my speakers sagging and facing 45 degrees toward the floor.It seems there are few budget options out there; I'd strongly consider making your own wall mount with a simple wood panel that you first screw the speaker to and then screw into your It's going to save you grief."
1,Overpriced and understrength,"These will not hold anywere near the rated 10 pounds without 'drooping'. I questioned the design when I first saw them advertised, but saw several good reviews so went ahead and bought them. DON'T Be fooled! They may work great for some little PC type speakers that weigh a couple pounds, but when tasked with holding an 8 pound speaker, they just drooped, no matter how tight the ball fitting. Don't waste your money on this unless you have really light speakers. I am very disappointed because I've had good luck with some of Omnimount's other products. Also the included hardware was junk! Had to go to the hardware store to get decent mounting hardware."
2,Good for small speakers,"These mounts are a good idea for small speakers, but do not attempt to hang a speaker approaching the rated weight. My 8 lb speakers will NOT stay in place no matter how much you tighten the set screw. The ball will just not hold. I will need to buy something else for my purposes."
3,Compromised,"I requested three Omni-Wall Mounts, stainless steel, black in color. I received all three but one had been previously used. The package was open, some parts were missing and the black paint was removed from about 1/3 of one side. Poor showing for a product that was supposed to be new..."
4,Oh how I wish,"I've had the game for quite some time, and due to limitations brought about from the computer's capabilities, have never been able to do quite what I've wanted: Largest map possible with no limits on population sizes for plants and animals. But now Windows seven, and eight, don't work with it. Too bad.While the game lacks graphics (if you want a second rate version of the game with good graphics, try spore), it makes up for it through an interesting idea I'd love to see somebody do to make the subject of genetics more accessible to common people."
2,Great Idea Hobbled by poor interface,"I've played a number of SIM games and this one is a great idea... but I was totally unable to get into it. The user interface was too primative. It's much worse than the other games in the SIM series, many of which I've enjoyed.I've played newer games such as Europa Universalis which many folks claim requires way too much attention to detail and has a too-steep learning curve but I found this game to be worse. I've heard that there are similarities between this game's concept and that of SPORE I guess I'll give that a try."
3,Is this really how it happened??,"This book is nicely written with a rich vocabulary, good character development, and is entertaining. However, I find it very odd that it seemed to do very little with actual history. I'm not a stickler for the facts by any means, but I would like the story to atleast somewhat resemble events that may have actually occurred. The life of Subotai is fascinating and I'm sure contains many wonderful stories. This story, however, seems quite far fetched and a little too romanticized.I was thrilled to find this book at first because I thought it would be a perfect supplement to the other books I've read on the Mongol empire and Ghenghis Khan. But I found it to have very little to do with the other stories I've read nor any other historical accounts. I eventually lost interest as I was reading.It is, however, a very good story, if you care nothing about actual historical events."
1,C'mon Joe - 6 months and no house sale :(,Ok - the statue arrived (very slow shipping by the way) and I buried it.No house sale yet! damn.Well it can't all be his fault right?oh well.
5,sad catholic,"well it hasn't worked yet.. but i will keep faith, that house is gonna sell, it will, I tell ya"
1,It didn't work,"The price and quality of the product was great. However, my house never sold - maybe I did something wrong."
4,It worked,"I am not one who believes in these types of things but a friend convinced me to give it a shot. We needed to sell a house relatively fast because we were moving out of state. Our house was on market 3 days and we accepted an offer @ asking price. I tend to think it was setting the price right, my friend believes old St Joe was at work. Regardless, <$10 and a little faith never hurts."
3,question,it saids to bury it next to the for sale sign in the back yard. who puts a sale sign in the back yard.?
1,I fell for it!,"I bought the St. Joesph. I followed his instuctions to the T.. and got no buyers for my house still after 2 months. I do pray to the saints so I am a beleaver.. But Dont waste your money on this Just pray ,, no statue needed!!!"
3,No Instruction Included,"I just buried this today so no clue if it will work. I'm hoping and praying it will. However I was very dissapointed in the packaging. It says in the description and on the package ""instructions"" included. I did not get any instructions! I had to look them up online so I'd know how to bury it correctly and what prayer to say! Very unhappy with that part of the product!"
5,House is sold,"House on market since July 1, 2010. No offers.St. Joseph arrived and placed in home to be sold on December 17th.Buy/sell agreement signed December 22nd.Closed on sale on January 7, 2011."
1,Arrived in poor condition,"I purchased the St. Joseph home sale kit for a friend who has been struggling to sell her house. It wasn't an expensive gift but it was a gift nonetheless. However, the kit was shipped in an ordinary padded envelope and its little cardboard box didn't survive the rigors of the postal service. It was dented and smashed. In addition, the cardboard packaging looked like it had been exposed to moisture, it was slightly puffed in areas and looked old and used. Overall the kit that I received was not in gift-giving condition although the contents were unharmed. It was very disappointing."
3,Novelty fun item- no results,"you dont really think this thing will solve all your problems do you? its a cute gift for someone that has too much real estate and cant sell it. a fun gimmick, but dont hold your breath, because you might be burried right next to it!"
1,This is witchcraft!!,"I am Catholic, I work for a large Catholic Church and this practice is using something sacred for a non-sacred purpose and that's paganism - witchcraft.Insiders of the church know that and, rather than offend people, tend to look the other way instead of educating and warning people.There is a real Devil - Satan..and he is pretty darned good at manipulating people and events to make his side look attractive. He can engineer a house sale in a flash if it means hooking another poor soul into thinking they should trust in ""hocus-pocus"" rather than in Jesus Christ Himself.Amazon, I'm a good customer of yours and it grieves me to see that you are propogating material like this. Guess I learned something about you today.So sad.To those who want to make use of this little bit of magic, try surrendering your life to Christ, make Him the center of your world and let His Spirit guide everything you do, including selling your house.JW"
1,Plastic statue guy,"Please realize this is just a plastic statue thing, so don't expect it to sell your house. That's what realtors are for, and in a crappy economy they're just as worthless. Save your money for the additional funds you'll need to take to the settlement table so you don't have to pay utilities for another year. That little guy is still buried somewhere in the front yard with it's butt in the air, good riddance."
1,IT didn't work for me :(,I have heard so many positive results from St Joseph - It hasn't worked for me. It has been 6 months and not even a bite. And I have a nice home.
1,Hooey!,"Buried the darn thing six months ago, house is still for sale.Of course, I kinda figured it was hooey, but it never hurts to hope."
2,Didn't work,"I got this silly plastic statue because I had heard it brought good luck in selling houses. I knew it was just a wives tale, but I figured it couldn't hurt. It's cheap and it's plastic, but I wasn't expected much more then that based on the description. We were trying to sell our house in a hurry and it didn't happen for us as quickly as we needed it to. Granted, winter is not the best time to list a home...but if you are buying it for the hopes of 'helping' for a quick sale, save your money and just cross your fingers. (Or list it in the spring at a good price!)"
3,"Good story, writing kind of weak","I enjoyed this book. I am new to mysteries and found this one to be compelling, but I was turned off somewhat by her writing styled. It seemed more like a teen-age romance novel in some ways, especially in some of the description. However, I am anxious to read her second attempt to see if the writing has improved. I think she has great potential."
5,DARK HUNTER,"Valerius & Tabitha Devereaux. What an odd combination. Valerius so straight-laced, so uptight. Tabby so free, so sassy. Sparks fly in more ways than one. Tabby's twin sister is mated to Valerius' mortal enemy. But are they really enemies?? Can they make it work?? Sherrilyn Kenyon ( Author Goddess)."
3,"Ok, but start at beginning books","Hello,I personally love Sherrilyn Kenyon and will read most anything with her name on it. However, this novel gets bogged down with setups for future novels and loses focus (or me) in the last fourth of the book. I like that Tabitha was more of a ""real"" person instead of the caricature she was in Night Pleasures. At first I didn't want to read Valerius' novel due to the animosity the other characters felt with him. Good read. Couldn't put it down. Still love Night Pleasures and Fantasy Lover the best of all."
2,who wrote this?,"I like Kenyon's earlier works, they're witty, steamy and fun. But what happend to Kenyon's newest book 'Seize the Night'? Akward syntactics stopped the flow of the novel, and the story line also has akward connectiions between the characters. This book gives me the feeling that it is someone else's work and not Kenyon's. I gave 'Seize the Night' only 2 stars because it just does not have the same quality that is found in the earlier Dark Hunter novels. I hope this is not this is not a trend."
3,Lots of hype,"She almost pulls it together. I was glad to see Valerius and TAbitha hook up, but he was just another wounded soldier. I really dislike Otto and how could she do that to Nick?I think it was just thrown together. Am I happy at the end of the book- not really. I just want Ash's story (I'm going to skip everyone else until then)"
5,OH MY GOD,tis is the best book in the series...their love story is dark yet so sweettis is one ball kicking heroineiwas surprisingly hooked onto it from start to finishi read the whole book in jus 6 hrspls read tis book...its definirely worth yr money
4,Great book but...,"The ending did seem somewhat thrown together (SPOILER HERE) what with Acheron deciding to grant immortal status to a couple of his friends (what he never had friends in the last 11,000 years?) which was mighty convenient, and then the whole thing with the ""new"" Dark Hunter and Acheron not realizing that even with his god status, he had cursed him. That said I liked the twist with Valerius and Tabby's empathic ability to see his pain. It's also always nice to see familiar faces too. I'm really hoping that the series can continue to be fun, without resorting to the pointless sex (as opposed to really great, plot driven sex) and lack of tension (sudden abilities to overcome anything by last minute ""I didn't know I could do that!"" powers) that is occurring with other formerly great series."
3,Tabby is the steam roller,"And Valarius is the small woodland creature she bowls over. Ugghh! The story started out with promise, but I really didn't like the way Val kept caving in to Tabby's psycho whims. I hated what the author did to Kyrian in this book! He was cold and harsh where Val is the compassionate Dark-Hunter. Not if you read Night Pleasures! The author also changes the rules a bit. Artimis grants each Dark-Hunter one single act of vengance in return for his/her soul, but lo and behold, Kyrian apparantly recieved two! SK- please don't change the game on us part way through!The best part was the advancment of Ash's story."
2,Shelved until a later time,"This is the first (and most likely only) Sherrilyn Kenyon book I've read. The premise sounded interesting, given that I'm an Anne Rice fan (mostly her early Lestat and Lasher books).This is book 7 of a series on immortal Dark-Hunters who hunt vampires. This book centers on Tabitha and Valerius. Tabitha is a human who hunts vampires and it's during one of her hunts that she meets Valerius, a Dark-Hunter disliked by everyone else.I haven't been able to finish the book, not so much the plot, but SK's writing style. She is constantly going on about how this guy is so sexy and all about their sexuality and deliciousness and then doing the same for the next guy. It gets old after a few lines. And her sex scenes seem to go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sex scene in a book, but when its pages and pages of it...After reading half the book, I haven't learned anything but what I've written above."
5,My favorite,"I have been hooked on Kenyon's Dark-Hunters since book one. And after a dozen or so books, this entry is still my all-time favorite. Each of the hunters is something of an outcast/rebel. Valerius stands out because he's an outcast even among Dark Hunters - he's a Roman and the mostly ancient-Greek hunters hate him. In particular Kyrian, who was betrayed and murdered by Valerius' own father, and Zarek, who was abused by the same man. Further, ""Val"" comes off as a sanctimonious prick. Yet, Tabitha will discover a man of honor, compassion and deep feelings beneath that mask. But, their romance faces obstacles beyond daemons and reclaiming his soul - her sister and family.This story sucked me in even more than all the others. I could not put it down and have re-read it many times. The entire series is wonderful, with rich mythology and complex characters. Highly recommended!"
5,"Fabulous Adventure, Couldn't put it down!!!","Once again Sherrilyn Kenyon has forced me to read all night long. I couldn't put this book down. My heart went out to Valerius so strong so upright, till Tabitha enters his domain, and shakes it up a bit. You can feel the sparks immediately from these too. This book as well as all other Dark Hunter books just grabs you and keeps you reading till the very last page, which is hard to come too cause you want it to go on and on."
2,Dislikeable Heroine,"So this might not be a fair review of this book because I became tired of the heroine after page 20 or so that I just put the book down and returned it to the library this morning. I'm not cool with any main characters inflicting mortal wounds on other protagonists, even and especially accidentally. If the Hero weren't a DH than he'd have been dead and when she noticed she'd stabbed a man who was not a daemon, she didn't seem particularly perturbed. I've liked Tabitha in the other books, but she didn't seem as smart-alecky in the beginning of this one. Also there was nothing really unique about Valerius. I was just bored with it and I decided this one would SO not be a good use of my evening. Anyway so I'll read the next one and hope it gets better."
3,almost awesome,"The sound is fantastic. I just received these yesterday and am wearing them for the first time today. My job is in a quiet office so I'll be wearing headphones for the better part of the day and then on the bus home. Great sound and at first they fit great. I'm a small person (not as in dwarf, but petite) and the phones fit snugly on my ear. The cushion is comfy and I love how this item packs away. Its a must for my public transit riding life. But now its a couple of hours in and both my ears are getting pinched--the right moreso than the left for whatever reason. I'm hoping they will loosen up w/time. But yea, the sound is great! Fantastic bass and high end!"
5,Koss scores again,"Koss scores again on these phones. While not as powerful or dynamic as their titanium diaphram earphones, these are smooth and transparent. They do a great job of reproducing the full spectrum, and have excellent balance. The difference between these and the titanium based phones is like the difference between a good pair of AR-3's, and BOSE speakers. Both excellent in their own way, but totally different. For the price....highly recommended. I would like to have a volume control, and a little heavier cord though."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped for,"I purchased these headphones to listen to my iPod nano while at my desk at work. They are open-backed which allows me to hear the phone ring or other people talking when played at moderate volume levels. The fit well and are easy to put on or take off but don't dislodge when I bend over or stoop. I hoped they might have the same speaker elements in them that Koss puts in their KTXPRO1s (a very fine, inexpensive over-the-head model) but sadly, that's not the case. These have only barely adequate bass and high frequencies that can get a bit harsh. iPod's pre-set EQs can make them listenable.Pros: light, comfortable, can fold up into a little ball (doesn't really make them any more compact but looks cool)Cons: so-so sound"
1,Slamboring?,"Too many matches that we had no reason to care about. And I love Reggie White, but his match was pretty bad. The only decent match was the main event because of Flair's return, but there is so much better. Don't waste your time with this show."
3,ok,i have the video and some of the matches were bad but some were good like the main event. but if i were u i wouldent buy it from here i bought mine from blockbuster.com for only 20.00
3,Slamborre 97 left me wondering.,"Slamborre,i felt had its ups and downs,The main event was pretty good but reggie white vs Steve Mcmichael Stunk.Not too bad of a show though."
3,rapping and good production,"I love the lyrical lines on this album, but the musical parts aren't always that great. The production is really good, too. Not bad. Of course, you are free to look elsewhere if this album isn't your thing."
2,Just Add Water is Just Run Out.,"Just Add Water is an average album with suga free doing what a cool west coast rapper should be doing is making the typical commercial west coast songs, although some featuring snoop dogg were good, but the rest is just over the top predictableness and overrated lyrics.Although it does have a nice premise, but the album is confusedThumbs Down."
3,"As gauzy as a dream, but good writing","I like Ms. Divakaruni's writing. As usual this book is written very well switching from the dream world to mythical world and reality. But I found the story itself ( and the character Rakhi's mother) as gauzy as a dream. The writing about the aftermath of 9/11 is good. For me, the best books so far by Ms. Diva karuni are her short story collection ""Arranged marriage ... "" and ""The unknown error of our lives""."
5,Shows the Balkan problems are nothing new...,"This is a great book. Historically accurate and fun to read, Britain decides to involve inself into the Balkans in an attempt to gain allies. The factions are happy to accept the arms but use them against all enemies, not just those intended. Perhaps those who want to involve us into the Balkans need to read this book. The ethnic/religious hatred/atrocities have been going on for centuries, and, as described in this story, is an underlying problem that good intentions will not make go away. It is a very graphic story, but very well written. On a personal note, I hope the author allows Lewrie to remain a bit of a rogue. He's becoming downright dignified!"
3,Slow going at the start,"Being a big fan of DL and Alan Lewrie, I rushed out and got this book the minute it was released. But, after wading through the first 50 pages or so, I put it down _ nothing was happening, and my old friend Alan was a bit boring. Now, many months later, I've picked the book up again. I don't enjoy it as much as the first couple of Lewrie books and, I'm sorry to say, the Balkans just don't interest me _ pirates or no pirates. Still, I'm finding Lewrie better company with my second attempt. I just wish Lambdin would tone down the ""accents"" he has his characters speak in. His attempts at pidgin English with a foreign accent are virtually incomprehensible. That said, I am looking forward to getting my hands on ""King's Captain""."
5,Thunder by the Sea,Perfect. It sounds real. It's relaxing. I slept like a baby. I recommend it to anyone looking for a nice thunderstorm sound to listen to in order to relax.
3,An ok c.d.,Not the best cd I've ever purchased. It does not put me to sleep like others I have purchased. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,not very relaxing,"Perhaps this CD should have been entitled ""Sounds of the Sea, With Thunder,"" as the sea surf and wind are really howling on this CD. When I first heard it, I was wondering if this was recorded during a hurricane! Nevertheless, the sounds are very natural, and after about 30 minutes the sounds of the surf start to become somewhat hypnotic. I find no difficulty falling asleep to this CD, but MUST keep the volume on the low side so that I don't feel like I am being washed away to sea!"
1,Not as it seems....,"While I was greatly looking forward to receiving my copy of this book as I had enjoyed it years ago as a graduate student (borrowed at the time) I was greatly disappointed with the materials. While the book the represent is there, it is clearly a poorly done reprint. Pages do not line up within the text as the format is larger than the original text. There is no table of contents and in most cases when there is a list, I am left with the impression that the person working with the material has no clue how to use a word processor. It is certainly not the book they show when you look at the ""view inside"" option. The DeCapo introduction is not there. I have never had to return a book to Amazon before, however in this case I think I am making an exception as this is a terrible version of one of the great examples of bibliographical history. It is clearly not an edition I would recommend to anyone."
3,"Lots of information in this book, but lots of chaff.","This book was written by someone who actually knew Jackson and had access to family papers, so there are all sorts of interesting tidbits and insights for the serious researcher. However, you really have to did to find them because of the blather, side excursions, opinion stated as fact, and other irrelevant matter, all written in an ornate and archaic 19th Century style."

4,The first of a line of fantastic records by the Jam,"The amazing thing about this record is its deceptive simplicity. It has all the halmarks of punk, 3 chords and attitude, but it has deep intelligence, pop reference and lays the ground work for the true Jam materpieces such as Setting Sons and Sound Affects. It's 1998 and I still listen to this great punk album in my car!"
4,The Jam's debut,"While the Jam would go on to produce some of the best later post-punk rock that you could find in the UK, this is not as strong a record as one could wish. The singing is not yet as developed as it would get on later releases and the playing has not reached the virtuoso heights that they would later achieve. OK it is still very much punk and mo-influenced."
3,Slow Down,"'In The City', The Jam's pounding, caveman first album should be viewed as a statement of intent, rather than an initial explosion of creativity. It has it's moments - the amazing 'Away From the Numbers' is one of the best things they ever recorded - but generally it has a horrible rushed feeling about it.Evil magnate villains Polydor Records take the lions share of the blame. Signing a very young group on potential and then forcing them to release albums (two in less than a year!) isn't the wisest course of action, and it wasn't 'til the much more clarified and laid back Jam period of 'All Mod Cons' that things got satisfyingly serious.'ITC' is a must for completists and it plots the subsequent Jam path vigorously, but it's not the best Jam album by a country mile."
2,Broke after a year,I was using this item on not even hard ice cream and the shaft separated from the scoop.
3,this order was cancelled,"I'm sure this is a perfectly lovely ice cream scoop, but since the order was cancelled I did not receive it."
2,Not tough enough...,"The handle is not very sturdy for leveraging hard ice cream. The metal shaft only extends for two-thirds of the length of the handle, leaving an empty rubber sheath for the final third. Overall, not a terrible scoop, but I expected a better handle out of a product that is called ""Good Grips""."
1,"Comes apart easily, poor design/materials",This scoop falls apart while in use. The piece that slides inside the scoop flexes and comes out of its slot in the axle then the whole thing falls into four pieces. This would be a good scoop if that sliding piece were stiffer or if it extended into the slot more deeply or if it were firmly attached to the axle instead of being held in place by its weak spring force. This is something that product testing should have discovered before it was put on the market.
1,Not strong enough for ice cream,Stick to scooping out cookie dough with this item. Great ergonomics but the scoop will break (and has) with any sort of hard ice cream. The shaft is plastic and breaks easily if forced to cut into hard ice cream.
2,Poor Design and Not for Cookies,"I bought this because it was the only scoop BB&B; had in stock at the time. I needed a #20 cookie scoop as recommended by Alton Brown. Turns out this is significantly larger than #20. As such, the scoops were so big the cookies didn't cook evenly - undercooked in the middle, overcooked along the edges.Not only that, the little metal scraper broke off on the second or third use. Fortunately, I was able to reattach it, but a cookie or two later, it broke off again. It did this same thing for ice cream, too. What were the designers thinking?!I replaced it with Oxo's Good Grips Cookie Scoop (large size) from Amazon and couldn't be happier. It's sturdy and scoops the perfect amount of cookie dough so the cookies are cooked evenly throughout and consistently sized.I ended up tossing this Oxo Good Grips ice cream scoop in the trash. If you need an ice cream or cookie scoop, get something else. This thing will just frustrate you and fall apart."
5,Cupcakes?,"I purchased this scooper for cupcake mix rather than ice. It is perfect. I have only used it once so far, but the slider pushes the mix out nicely and it is easy to clean. I think I might purchase a smaller one too."
1,"Bent on first use, broke on fifth","The title says it all. I've been pleased with other OXO kitchen appliances, but this ice cream scoop was not designed to stand up to ice cream. The scoop part is fine (the same way a regular spoon is fine), but the ""trigger"" is absolutely worthless."
3,Maybe I overworked it?,"As for the function, the scooper does its job well. It is also conveniently dishwasher safe. It broke after the first year of use, but I'm not sure if this is due to our freezer's temperature control being broken and our ice cream being rock-solid. We had it exchanged for free and now have a freezer that works; I will update this review if it breaks again."
1,Broke in half,"Purchased this December 22, 2006. Last night May 13, 2007 it snapped in half while scooping sherbert. Snapped in half as in the scoop part broke off the handle. Not even 6 months old, stay far away from this one."
2,Not worth it,"This thing literally fell apart after only a few uses. It was cheaper than other similar ones, which is why I tried it, but I wouldn't buy it again. Even at the price, it wasn't worth it."
2,Lefties unite!,"It looks nice, but too bad it won't work for me. I'd buy the left-handed version, though. :-("
1,Not Good Grips,"This is not a good product. The first one we had broke just above the handle , the metal lever that ""scoops"" the ice cream out, also fell apart. Very flimsy. The replacement one we got from the store did exactly the same thing. Don't buy this. I usually like OXO products and own quite a few other kitchen utensils that they produce."
4,Like it very much but wouldn't buy again.,"Aside from a few initial problems, this stove is great! My daughters, ages 22 months and 4 1/2, have been playing with this for three days straight! Its gorgeous and very well-designed.That being said, I would suggest purchasing the slightly more expensive Pottery Barn version. In fact, I plan to complete this set with the PB's sink. My reasoning is simply that Pottery Barn's customer service and quality controls seem superior. You really do not save any money with the Dexton model due to incredibly high shipping costs. This is important to consider in case something is wrong and god-forbid you need to ship it back to the seller. This is why despite a faulty clock and disturbingly strong paint odor we decided to keep it. (The paint odor disappeared after an afternoon outdoors)All in all I have to say that I really do love this stove, oh - and so do my girls, however, I probably would not purchase it again."
2,Feel ripped off,"Be aware that this is new cover for Maya: Great Katun. So now I have two recordings of same music. If you are looking for ""Relaxation Spa"" music, this is also not it. Nothing relaxing about this one or the Greek themed one, also titled to be Spa. I like Paul's music; just wish the Spa labeled stuff had better representation of the actual tracks, and that I could spend the $32 on something else."
4,BUYER BEWARE: This is a re-issue of MAYA: THE GREAT KATUN.,"As the reviewer of the other ""Relaxation Spa"" CD indicated, this, too, is a re-issue album--this time, of MAYA: THE GREAT KATUN (Avgerinos' 1st release), an atmospheric, dark, mysterious & enthralling electronic interpretation of what it might be like to witness an ancient Mayan ritual at night. For a more detailed review, see my contributing review for this disc over at iTunes. (The title of the disc has been shortened to MAYA, by the way.)I'm not sure what the motivation is behind the record company not telling people upfront that these are both previously-released albums.....but knowing the kind of person Paul is (interpret that as, my best guess), I seriously doubt that he would be at the bottom of something potentially crooked like this."
1,Slippers Men's Dorm,"I ordered the recommended one size up. The toe box length and width is tight, but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose. A full size increase to a 9M from the size, which I ordered (8M) would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose. As other reviewers noted, these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable. The 3/4"" rubber raised soles appears adequate. As I write this review, my feet are becoming quite warm, after about twenty minutes, with my athletic socks.After an hour, my feet are roasting in these slippers. Would I purchase again? Difficult to say, if the toe box doesn't loosen up for comfort.01/25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW (Designer Shoe Warehouse)with two pairs, which fit. My feet were never comfortable with this pair. Would not recommend."
4,VERY comfortable,they are VERY comfortable...i ordered the wider size based on the other comments on this site...i wear them all the time now at home
2,Dorm Slippers,The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort. That made the slippers unusable for me.
2,"Not just inexpensive, but cheap as well!","I tried on these slippers on precisely one time, then returned them to the box. They weren't horrible, just not real comfortable, and I got the feeling they wouldn't be particularly warm. But to be fair, I didn't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency. I just didn't like the feel of them.For my money, better to pay a little more and get better quality."
2,Mens Slipper,"Good Quality...But opening for foot way too small...My huband couldn""t get his foot in the slipper...Other wise nice slipper shoe"
5,Love 'em,I have to say that I was a little skeptical about buying something I couldn't try on first. But I was more than happy when I got them and tried them on for the first time. The fit was perfect. I like my slippers a little snug. They do stretch just a bit. I would suggest going up half a size from your normal shoe size if you would rather they be a little looser.The slippers themselves are comfortable and very warm! Love the sole and the traction it gives. I do have just the slightest bit of slippage around the area of my heel though. (Not a design flaw just a narrow heel on my part) The color is exactly what I expected and shipping was quick. I recieved them just a couple of days after I put in my order.Overall I am very happy with the slilppers and everything else.
3,Ok for the price,These slippers are cost effective but not very comfortable. Warm and cozy. Soles are flat with no arch support.If you are flat footed these will work well for you...if you have a high instep you will have a hard time getting these on.They run narrow but true to length.
2,Runs small,"Having read another review that said these slippers ran small, I ordered the next size up but it was too small. I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger. This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere."
5,Awesome,These were just want I wanted when I got themsuper soft and they fit just rightthe sole have rubber n them so you won't slip
5,Hubby loves them,This was a replacement pair for a size 12 that seemed to run very small. This pair fits great and is very comfortable.
3,Don't breath,Within 5 minutes my feet were sweating. They are comfortable and well padded but sadly I could just never wear them for this reason so I had to send them back
4,Nice and warm,"These slippers are very comfortable and warm. I'm very happy to have bought them.My only ""problem"" is that even though they're a size 16, they felt smaller at first.All n' all, I'd recommend them."
5,Completely Satisfied,These slippers are exactly what I needed. They are very warm and durable. They have the solid sole I require for the times I need to step outside and do not want (or have time) to change footwear.
4,Runs Small,"I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a larger size than I thought I would need. I normally wear size 12, but after reading the reviews that all said they run small I ordered the largest size available at the time which was 13 W. I would have ordered a 14 but it wasn't available at the time. 14 would have been perfect but these will do. ORDER LARGER THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED."
5,Excellent slippers for the price.,"I am very satisfied with these slippers. Lightweight,warm,comfortable, and have good outdoor soles These slippers felt too tight in the toe area at first, but after a week of wearing them the fleece lining compacted. They need a break in period to know their size. Low price is a bonus. They appear sturdy but have had them only a week so cannot judge durability."
3,Disappointed.,"Liked the way this shoe looked and the way it was made, but it ran very, very small and the opening was too small as well. Had to send them back."
3,sized small slippers,"great craftsmanship, but sized smaller than previous purchase. I should have ordered a size larger, but went by last purchase of a similar item."
2,Sole wears out rapidly,Comfortable slipper. Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper. Would not purchase these slippers again.
4,Excellent product but watch the size,I concur with one the earlier reviews in that the boot slipper is excellent but watch the sizing. If you go 1 to 2 sizes above your regular size you will be good to go. Recommended.
2,BEWARE! Size 12 shoes in size 14 box!,"These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size. I wear a 13 and a half shoe, but knowing that house shoes need to be loose, I ordered them in a size 14. They were SO small, I couldn't force my feet into them. And if the seller (different than the manufacturer) really had a ""bend-over-backwards"" policy as they state, they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free. / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order. But, it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes (even big and tall stores). I guess I'm just screwed."
1,Out of subject,"This book concentrates on c++, but it doesn't mention much about C++ Builder. I do not recomended it, if you want to learn Borland C++ Builder."
1,where is Borland C++ Builder in this book,"On the 977 pages of the book, 548 are about C, 325 pages are about C++ (Standard template library included) and barely 89 pages (!!!) on Borland C++ Builder. Nothing is said about the VCL, MFC or any specificificity of the Borland C++ compiler. The title is totally misleading."
1,Useless,"Don't be fooled by the title. This volume is merely a warmed-over C/C++ primer to which has been appended a superficial 80-page section on the C++Builder IDE. There is only the most paltry discussion of using C++Builder to construct Windows GUIs and applications. If you already know C and C++, this book will be of no use to you. If your aim is to build Windows GUIs using C++Builder, look elsewhere."
2,"Not bad, but not great.","This book has a lot of good information for people who are interested in learning C++. I have had experience programming in other languages, but this was my first time using C++. The book was well written and easy to learn, but I felt disappointed at the lack of information on the actual Builder Environment. The information and example program is a great start on learning to use the Builder, but the book could have used 4 or 5 more chapters on it. I have learned a lot about C++ programming from this book, but unfortunately I am going to have to buy another book to learn more about the Builder."
1,Disappointing!,"Do not buy this book. It's a shame because some of the people who wrote in it. However, the contribution in this book are deeply disappointing, most are either commonplaces or do not bring anything new to the subject.You would better read what Austin Sarat writes!"
5,Post-nuclear action galore!,"This is for the people who love good old action/adventure with great characters. The small group of guardians are formed after WWIII breaks out and it is a fun read, and pretty damn believable."
2,Poorly written but I find the subject thought provoking,"I have read 6 of the 8 in the series, the author does a very good job of bringing the books and characters together. To a normal HS Educated reader that has served any time as a Grunt they will be slow but enjoyable. To the Elite it will be jibberish."
4,One of a kind crime novel,"My first Dashiell Hammett book and after reading it I decided I'm hooked on his writing. The plot is tight no doubt, but the ending especially left me thoroughly impressed at the skillful crafting of the story. That aside, the playful banter between Nick and Nora Charles amused, and surely the dry wit of Nick will elicit a chuckle. Add to the whole mix a bunch of crazy characters like the Wynant family who can't seem to talk straight, and you get an absorbing whodunnit with a generous dose of humour."
2,"Good Story, Annoying Recording","Good book, bad recording.Ever hear Firesign Theatre's ""Nick Danger"" episodes, where male actors do the Femme Fatale's voice in falsetto? This recording is exactly the same. Unfortunately, here we are supposed to take the characters seriously. The unintentional humor lasts about five minutes, after which I turned it off and listened to Firesign.The contrast between the realistic male narrator's voice and the absurd falsetto of the females creates a jarring disconnect. Although I did finally listen to all six disks, I never really lost myself in the narrative.Next time, how about just reading the story?"
4,"Fun, fun fun!!","I imagine for people way into the detectival genre, this is not the book for them. However, the characters in this book are a hoot!! Nobody's telling anyone the whole truth, no one is sure who they can trust. The mystery, as with everything else in this novel, is a bit bizarre, but I think the important part of this book is the characterization. The Wynants/Jorgensons are all nuts. Many of the men are womanizers and boozers. And then there's Nick and Nora. They are one of the most fun couples I've read about. You get the impression that Nora doesn't know much about Nick's past (and really doesn't care). Nick is a good deal older than her, but she has money, so that's all that matters. They are probably the best part of this book. Overall, it is just a fun book to spend an evening with."
1,"Watch the movie, instead","Having come off of reading Maltese Falcon and watching the Thin Man movie, I had high expectations for the book. Unfortunately I found it extremely dull, and the characters Nick and Nora, who are so vibrant and alive on screen, are two dimensional alcoholic drips on paper. It took a lot of time to get through this book, and in the end, I didn't care what happened. Although the movie doesn't have much of a plot, it is far more entertaining than the book."
1,Horrid book - waste of time and money,"This is the first novel I have ever read where I cared nothing at all about any of the characters(excepting Asta, the dog). I actually wished, while slogging through, that all of the characters would die so that I could stop reading.None of the characters feel real and the prose itself is choppy. I realize that I'm looking at this novel through modern eyes, which is unfair, but it seemed that all the women do is cry, lie, and answer the phone, which grates on my nerves.If it weren't required for school, I would have been done with this book two pages in. Save your money."
4,Dective Noir,"An old story. It is amazing what changes there have been in culture since the 20's or 30's. In this book, they drink and smoke from morning till night. The humor is great and so is the story. I always thought the title represented the detective, but if you read you find out different. I will not give out the plot twist, read it."
4,Good Read,"Just falls short of being called a classic, but nevertheless an excellent read and gathers pace as one reaches the end. I found it very contemporary, almost everything ""modern"" is discussed or inferred to, be it drug use, incest, toy boys or sexual ambiguity. No wonder it still retains its freshness. I think this is a must read.Loved when the wife says that they can ""fly"" back to San Francisco - remember the story takes place in 1932!! Lovely"
4,Well written book makes excellent listen.,"A 2007 Summer reading list mini review.I just finished listening to Dashiell Hammett's The Thin Man read by William Dufris. If I had actually read it, I would certainly call it a page turner. Hammett turns a phrase with the best of them, and Dufris does an excellent job embodying the narrator: sleuth sophisticate Nick Charles and the rest of the assundry characters that populate Hammet's world.I think listening rather than reading helped me to catch the atmosphere of this detective novel. And what atmosphere there is! There's lies and there's sex on this audiotape. There is so much drinking in this book, that I will probably wake up with a hangover, and I never touch the stuff. But besides the whiskey, there is also the wry sensibility of Nick Charles. Hammett never lets Nick lose control of the caper and that makes for an enjoyable read or listen for the audience."
3,Another (make-believe) Era,"The writing is OK, but Hammett tries to describe a life style that, in my opinion, never was. Two words."
2,Hammett's Lukewarm send-off,"It always saddens me to think that Hammett, who created hard-boiled literature with THE MALETESE FALCON and RED HARVEST, should close out his writing career with this polite fluff about a married couple solving a socialite murder. Chandler would years later praise Hammett as the man ""who gave murder back to people who had reason to committ it"", but THIN MAN shows an unfortunate regression back to the old school that Hammett helped to eclipse. This is lightware fare, and nothing else."
3,100 Words or Less,"I simply adore the movies... and while this novel had some of that panache, it is a much darker, harsher world.Is that disappointing? Well, yes."
3,The movie was loosely based on the book,"I'm a huge fan of the Thin Man series of movies, so when I saw the book being offered I snapped it up. I found that the movie only slightly follows the book. The characters are there and some of the Nick and Nora relationship dynamics as well along with the basic plot but other than that there wasn't a lot of similarity. The humor that was such a wonderful part of the movies only occasionally shows up in the book. The witty dialog between Nick and Nora is pretty much absent as well. In short I was pretty disappointed. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Nick and Nora movies I would have enjoyed the book. If you like old detective stories you will probably enjoy it. My next stop is the Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett. I may not enjoy it as much as the movie, as in the case of the Thin Man, but who can resist reading the books that started such classic and enduring movies?"
5,The Definition Of Great Jazz,"Incredible music. From the get-go. The musicians are super, super-tight players. The solos are electrifying, the harmony is sweet, I really can't say any more. If you're a listener, buy this album."
4,Matt Helm Lounge,"I thought Dean Martin was fantastic as Matt Helm.. I enjoyed all 4 movies immensely.. It was great to travel back to the 60's again.. Elke Sommer, Stella Stevens, Ann Margret, and Senta Berger were super..What great flicks!!!!!Rich Crowl"
4,Cool looking back,"Item arrived on time, Its not as good as I remeber, but still ok, Dean Martin is alway good in his movies"
5,Simply Cool,"Loved these movies as a kid and loved when they came out on dvd. The Matt Helm movies had the budget and gadgets of the James Bond films, but were done a bit more tongue and cheek than 007. Dean Martin was and always will be the king of cool. He plays the charming yet devilish special agent to a T. While the budgets for these movies were on par with the Bond movies and were obviously done with a more comedic bent, they definitey appear more dated than the Bond movies of the time. None the less, they are still a classic example of 60's action flicks when real stars and men were in the movies."
3,Bad quality,I am a big Dean Martin fan so I really wanted these. They were a big disappointment. I still have VHS that the quality is better.They must have transferred them to DVD without doing any enhancement or clean up at all.They were cheap and maybe worth what I paid for them. That is a decision each buyer will have to make for themselves
3,The Original Austin Powers!,"This guy is the Real Thing! Grooving Shagging super crooner Deany the Martini of Ocean's Eleven Rat Pack lays own the ladies and puts the bad guys in their place, all with a twinkle in his scotch glass! Great fun for everyone except recovering alcoholics!"
1,About as bad as a movie from a book could be,"Donald Hamilton created the ultimate hard-nosed spy in Matt Helm, a man who would always do what had to be done. Somehow this became used as a farce by Dean Martin. One can only wonder why the filmmakers would want to waste money buying rights to Matt Helm when they didn't intend to use anything from the books, or create a character even vaguely comparable. Even the James Bond series in its early incarnations had some relationships to Fleming, although it too ultimately degenerated into farce until Daniel rescued it. But this Dean Martin nonsense--stupid, poorly paced, poorly written and most of all---utterly irrelevant to the great books that are now, alas, out of print."
2,Dirty disks,The disks came with a sludge on the read surface that had to be cleaned before the DvDs could be used.
5,DINO'S NUMBER#1,"It's great that the studio's is finally putting out a Matt Helm box set at a really great price compared to the more expensive separate versions.Any fan of 60's spy movies will love this set.Dean Martin's tongue is firmly in his cheek, and the women ,Tina Louise,Sharon Tate,Ann Margret,and many many more,what more can I say.Highly recommended!!"
3,"O, How Times Have Changed","When I was about eight, the Matt Helm movies were new. I watched them all at the drive-in theatre where my mother worked. And I loved them.Attitudes toward women have changed immensely since then, making them a little more difficult to watch.On the upside, Helm, as played by Dean Martin, doesn't take himself too seriously. He always _almost_ gets the girl, but rarely, erm, scores. Despite the sexism, the women often outshine, out think and out perform Helm and the other men.Fun. Very 1960s. Definitely not for everyone."
4,Playful Romp,"Dean Martin makes this farce and enjoyable romp...just sit back, light a cigerette , pour a glass of booze and bring on the broads. Warning Pre- Political Correctness if you are thin skinned don't look..call your nanny now."
5,It was Helm at his best!,I felt the dvd's were good quality and they were exactly what I expected. I love old movies and these will be added to my collection.
5,"If you like Matt Helm, like I do, you'll love this set.",Matt Helm movies are not up to James Bond standards. But fun none the less. This set is a very nice set of fine movies. The Matt Helm movies are nothing like the Matt Helm books. Dean Martin does not do a good job of portraying Matt Helm. Dean does a good playing Dean Martin as a spy. Which is OK with me.
4,Matt Helm Lounge fall short on extras,"I've enjoyed the Matt Helm movies when I was younger, so I decided to purchase this collection. It is nice to have all the movies all together, and the quality is great.You only get the movies, and a couple of orginal promos, but that's about it. No other extras, but I still enjoy them."
4,"dean martin, matt helm collection","for those that love toungue in cheek comedy, than this will suit you. for those that enjoy being entertained with a non social meaning, this is it. dean martin as always leaves the viewer wanting more of his antics. and, as usual he always surrounds himself with a beavy of beautiful women. for entertainment get it!"
5,Matt Helm is the greatest spy.,From an era that smoked drank and fooled around comes a funny look at the super spy.Dean is great as the great Matt Helm.Classic comedy
5,dean martin is #1,if you like austin powers then you should get this box set. you will see where it all began.
3,"""Helm, Matt Helm""",Brings back wonderful memories of a better and simpler time. Very tongue in cheek. Plots are a little thin as series progress. Good viewing for baby boomer generation. EH
4,Outstanding!,"Although the FF series didn't publish many books of a science fiction nature, sub-author Robin Waterfield really went to town on this one. 'Rebel Planet' perhaps proved the best sci-fi gamebook, because of two aspects: firstly, the concept of Earth in the twenty-fifth century being occupied by the Arcadian Empire; and secondly, the adventure itself was spread across four planets diverse in culture and attitude. There wasn't much added to the Adventure Sheet - only Credits for currency. But despite lacking in new additional rules and attributes, Waterfield devised a breathtaking, sinister mission to end Arcadian rule and free mankind from alien tyranny. Although not of the sword and sorcery type, 'Rebel Planet' proved an interesting challenge. Certainly, it would take you more than one attempt to find the clues and gain access to the Central Computer."
3,Gassy,I began Reading Rilke hoping for a concise and perhaps straightforward overview of the work of a writer whose work has interested and perplexed me for a long time. The title should have been a clue: the work seems to be less about Rilke than the author's celebration of his own cleverness. Some day I may get all the way through it.
3,Mixed results,"Gass's comparisons of previous translations of Rilke show a deep understanding of the problems involved in translating this complex poet. His own versions of the Duino Elegies are passable, though he is largely unconcerned with poetic rhythm. He even quotes previous translations in prose (i.e. without line breaks)! Gass's own famously ornate prose shows signs of strain; it is breezy and full of jarringly inappropriate similes. Wonderful insights are often juxtaposed with irrelevant comparisons, making the book enjoyable and frustrating by turns."
5,Lovers of Rilke must experience this brilliant work.,"For those of us who have been caught in the overwhelming force of the Duino Elegies or the Sonnets for Orpheus, William Gass's short book of reflections explores the life that brought forth such poignant works. After reading what moves from essay to biography to personal response, I found myself understanding the trials that Rilke endured and the concerns that he faced each day. I could not help but grow closer to Rilke and his work, as Gass's masterful language found the perfect word, the perfect thought, and the perfect explanation for what made Rilke's poetry so powerful. The book carries an unfortunate title, because ultimately it is Gass's account of the life, the poetry, and the symbols that permeated Rilke's ouvre, not Gass's translation efforts, which remain sharp in my memory. This book is not for the casual reader, but for those who are truly moved by Rilke's work, for those seeking a deeper understanding and appreciation of it."
3,Still difficult...,"I found Gass's insights about translation and the art of poetry easier to appreciate than his translations of Rilke. This book has wonderful sections about Rilke's life and the difficulty of reconciling that life within the context of translating his poems. Gass often seems to find the right words to describe the art of poetry, and for that, I found this book wonderful. In Gass's attention to detail his analysis of poetry and of other Rilke translations are insightful (and at times beautiful) and led me to make notes in the margins. As for Gass's own translation: although he seems quite sure of himself, I don't find that his attention to detail gives him an easier time in translating Rilke's poems. This book provokes appreciation for the difficulty of translation and the magic of poetry."
2,Having it both ways,"As a translator I can sympathize with Gass' approach. He gets to fault all the other translators (this writer included)while also, implicitly and explicitly, celebrating his own results. But despite this rhetorical cunning, Gass, who is a fine essayist and novelist, does not have a poet's ear, and again and again his versions fall short of effective poetry. They must stand by themselves, ultimately, and while he does his utmost to justify them, they tend to reveal why he needs special pleading to put them before us as supposedly superior to other versions. Mine, from the mid-seventies, first published in FIELD and now available from Norton, have reached a wide public without this kind of explaining, carping, and denigration of the efforts of others."
3,Readable but flawed,"Gass's book gives the voyeur in us all a rare glimpse into the sordid life of Rilke but the lack of correctly quoted German (mostly spelling mistakes) and the fact that no poem is quoted in its entirety in German, makes for slipshod scholarship. Gass, who is probably a riot at parties of PhD students, can't put a stop to his sometimes foolhardy attempts at humor, albeit sarcastic at times, to make a point about translating. He refers to himself in the third person (among variations of poem translations) , which is ridiculous, and can barely contain himself when bashing other translators. Ho, hum."
2,Highly overrated,"I've been reading for years about how good this book is, and how it caused a irreparable rift between Elvis Costello and the author. Having read it, I cannot understand either. The writing is repetitive and precious. Thomas tries too hard to turn a phrase at every, uh, turn, and his incessant descriptions of how boring the touring life can be are equally as excruciating. I cannot figure out what Elvis got pissed off about? The fact the uses the ""lavatory"" three times before a show? His fear of flying? I get the feeling he must have just learned to dislike Thomas over time and this book was a good excuse to chuck him from the band. Americans wishing to learn British slang and vernacular will find this book rife with opportunity. For hardcore Elvis fans only, and only suitable then as bathroom reading."
1,"Meandering, angry and dull","I really thought this was going to show at least more than a fleeting glimpse at Elvis and the boys, but it's really just a pissed off ex-bass player spouting off at how everything sucks except him. There's not much about ""The Singer"" or the rest of the band, just Thomas waxing un-poetically about how much better he is than everyone else. Really sad..."
1,The Big Waste,"This is not a book for fans of Elvis Costello and the Attractions. If you're buying this book as a fan of the band, skip it. There's about 10-15 pages worth of material that mention anything interesting or funny related to that subject. The rest of the book is nothing but pointless rambling and pseudo-philosophical mumbo-jumbo. I guess this could count as Bruce's outlook on life. Oh, and there's that goofy chapter about letting some guy borrow a van. (???) Seriously, it gets so tedious and boring I just skimmed the last few chapters for anything relating to the band, but found nothing and closed the book. I have no idea why this book could be cited for causing problems between Bruce and Elvis. There's nothing inflammatory or personal revealed; just a few jokes made here and there about the band members' habits or demeanor while on the road. Wow."
2,This book needs tuning,"I would not recommend this book for ""power tuning"" tips. The book does a better job of explaining how the stock Mini components work. If you already know about Minis or have other books on Minis then you probably do not need this one. I was looking for such information as which brakes are best for my application, or which carb is best for performance and which is best for fuel economy. The book does tell a little bit about this kind of info, just not to the extent I was looking for. It did tell a bit about what is the best exhaust system to use, so that made me happy. I would suggest not paying too much for the book. Remember, this is just my opinion. You may be looking for different info than I. Thanks."
1,Monday Night Mayhem,To say this movie sucked is to make a new lower standard for the word suck.This was an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back.This movie made me want to buy a gun and rent a bullet.I had more fun on movie night in the state pen.Not only do I not recommend this movie I would recommend never seeing any movie starring these people again.
4,"Had it for about 2 years, still working","This tank is great for a starter tank, or just a small aquarium. Like I said, I've had it for about 2 years, and I still enjoy it. However, the ""undergravel filter"" really isn't a filter, just a ""catch-all"" for stuff that floats down in the gravel. It keeps the gravel kinda clean, but I still need to clean the tank once every few months. It's mainly just to aerate the water."
3,Aquarium review,"The aquarium and the stand are perfectly fine. However, the air pump is a piece of junk. It was incredibly noisy for the first 4 hours and then stopped functioning altogether. None of the parts are serviceable so I replaced it with a $10 pump from the local store."
1,"disappointed, loud pump","I was so excited to buy this for my 7 year old grandson for Christmas. His mother put it together for him after Christmas. The pump was extremely loud so she called the company ""Absouletly Pets"". She returned it to them, but they had no more. Now, that it is after Christmas we will have to figure out how to make it up to him.First time buyer on Amazon.com. Very disappointed."
5,Fantastic,"Reading the WWII novel, The Triumph and the Glory has interested me in other war novels. I was referred to the Sharpe's series by my uncle, and started with ""Sharpe's Eagle"", which had me spellbound. ""Sharpe's Company"" was every bit as good, and now I am hooked on the series. What a writer! Cornwell makes history come to life with a vengeance!"
1,Disappointing,"I saw this book on Oprah. If she recommends it, it must be good, right? Wrong. The book doesn't deliver what it promises. Common stains are not always included. I assume that Oprah recommended it because (of course) she doesn't do her own laundry and would have no way of judging the quality of this kind of book for those of us who do not have hired help."
2,Lots of stains not listed,"I was very disappointed with this book. I saw it on Oprah and thought that I had to have it because I'm not very good with laundry. It turns out that every time I've referenced it, the stain I'm looking to treat isn't included. For instance, GRASS STAINS! Where is that??? Anyone who has children would look for this first, yet it's not even in there. There are many common stains that aren't even listed. I wouldn't recommend this book; and I'm surprised that Oprah did."
3,Helpful,"This book offers helpful tidbits. One should always take precautions before doing a lot of this tips at home. Not everything is for everybody. If you have children with allergies or smaller children, you should take more precautions. The book is helpful, but some things in this book is basic common sense."
4,A great review,"I read this book, to find a way of cleaning off coffee-ground emisis off my coat. My mother had a upper-GI bleed and had projectile vomit all over my new kitchen. This emeises did not match my costom drapes nor, my paisley wallpaper. This book did not give any information on how to clean this blood-induced mess up. I then looked in the chapter named ""Cleanin' up after your religious sacrifice."" I found this chapter loaded with vivid details how Linda C. Cobb was able to clean up after her llama and spider monkey sacrifice. I would recommend this book to all teen-agers and some wacked out geriatric people."
3,Much better than episode 2,"I did watch this movie for many times. Finally, i got this blu ray version. I am a bit disappointed about the content because some hidden scenes were not covered in it. Sharon fans, don't miss it."
4,Trashy Fun,"I wasn't very impressed by Basic Instinct the first time I saw it, but having recently gained a new appreciation for Verhoeven's work, I decided to give it another look. I wasn't disappointed; this is a terrifically goofy, fun piece of work, that serves as marvelous entertainment if you don't take it too seriously. Sharon Stone is solid (in the one of the few roles I've seen her do where she actually acted), and Michael Douglas is surprisingly good, playing a nastier variation on all of his ""middle-aged-white-male-who-sleeps-with-younger-women"" roles. There's subtext here, if you want it, but you don't have to look for it to enjoy the movie.Verdict: It outdoes Brian Depalma, which is saying something."
5,Excellent... You gotta Love Sharon Stone,Excellent transfer both in picture and sound. The added scene adds something to miss Stone WOW...
3,You'll either like the movie or hate it,"Basic Instinct strikes me as an okay film; it's decent to some respect but it could have been more. The suspense level in this film could have been edgier. Instead, what this film is better at is creating some steamy sex scenes between Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. You probably won't see more sex in an R-rated film than in Basic Instinct. Ironically enough, the film's most suspenseful moments are also the sex scenes as we are left wondering whether Stone is the killer and if she plans to kill Douglas. Those scenes work very well as it's a very well-done concoction of eroticism and suspense. Most of the film's other moments, though, fail to achieve much interest. Still, those scenes are quite well worth the rental."
3,Elegant Trash,"I did not see this movie on first release in 1992, but just watched it last night after seeing the scorching trailer for the upcoming sequel. I figured maybe it was about time to check out the first film.There are plot holes galore. Acting that must have seemed very ""serious"" in 1992 now borders on camp. And yet, it is mesmerising. This is one beautiful looking piece of trash...and I mean trash in the most fun sense of the word. I can see why this film made Sharon Stone a sensation, and not because of the crotch-flash. She's definitely the best thing in it, other than Jerry Goldsmith's haunting and perfect score.All in all, it doesn't add up to much but sure is fun to watch and nice to look at."
4,SEXY SHARON STONE,"Sharon Stone at her sexiest simulated sex best. Borders on soft core porn in parts. See her Sliver too to see that she knows what she's doung when it comes to this mode of acting. I found the movie pretty good although the ending is somewhat confusing to me. Still, it has no Hollywood happy ending.I read somewhere that these roles embarass her somewhat. They are what have made her though, and she has full equals although you might try some early Kathleen Turner in Crimes of Passion and Body Heat. Meg Tllly in Bound, and of course, classic and classy Melanie Griffith in Body Double."
1,Basic Badness,"The fact that the selling point for this movie is Stone's sex scenes, says it all. Good thing she is attractive, because she can't act. Then again, who could act with a script this predictable and at times hysterical. Dialogue is so bad here you won't believe it. And Micahel Douglas phones in his usual angry-white-guy preformance - really he has to be one of the most limited actors out there.Anyways, this movie is a dog and watch some Ginger Lynn lingere videos if you want to see some steamy scenes. Stay away, far far away."
3,Overrated,"Basic Instinct is a beautifully created film with a compelling story with enough twists and psychological bends to captivate you. Yet the sotry is bogged down with gratuitous sexual encounters that do not propel anywhere. The acting of Michael Douglas in this film was distractingly bad. He was pissed off throughout the film for no apparent reason, even in the love scenes. Sharon Stone player her character very well, a cold, manipulating and very attractive woman. Of course there isn't very many scenes without her exposing herself. The movie seems to rest on her nudity, not her acting. Overall, the movie seems to elevate the gratuitous sex over the actual plot. So while I was being drawn into the story, the movie also pulled me away from it leaving me desiring more form the story."
1,There's gonna be a lawsuit on this one...,"Basic Instinct is markedly not one of cinema's finest moments. Basically, yes, as said, it is soft porn. The softest of kinds which does not even really qualify as softcore and should be relented to the wee hours of the morning on skinemax. However, don't necessarily take my word for it. There seems, however inexplicably, to be a real taste among the buying public for this stuff. I just think Stone would've done better as an extra in Caligula.Anyhoo, porno aside, HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT THIS DVD COMES COMPLETE WITH A METAL ICE-PICK!? ... DOES THIS STRIKE ANYONE AS A BAD IDEA???Don't get me wrong. I believe ONE DAY people will be innately good, but holy dancing [doo-doo]. I just don't think the Stone fans should be entrusted with something like this. SHEESH!"
2,.,"Bad, bad movie, with a goofy script and poor performances. Tries to be risque and fails. The sex scenes aren't really that big of a deal. Essentially a waste of time."
3,it's alright,it's a trip out film.Sharon Stone does a good job here.i think she is extremely overrated.but she does well in this thriller.Michael Douglas is in his usual victim role.the ending hurts it alot.
3,level the playing field,Sharon's great body at least draws attention away from her complete lack of acting ability which is evident in all her other movie roles. Jeanne's much better and still gets superhot. Michael is lucky. Music fits the scenes well. Storyline is basic but the way it's filmed and the lighting in some scenes is intriguing.
5,A suspence that keeps you on your toes,"I like this movie Sharon Stone playes a great role, the same with Micheal"
5,excellent,"The dvd was so good. No issues in the dvd. The sender was able to send the dvd even before the scheduled date, I like it!!!"
2,Schlock remembered for a crotch,"The crotch shot is the only bit of this heavy-handed erotic thriller that has remained in the popular imagination, and rightfully so. Sharon Stone's sexiness falls far short of the level of enthrallment Douglas accords it, and the bisexual psychologist is the only real sexy character (including, I'd say, Douglas). The action scenes are about average, and the plot becomes more convoluted than is justified by the payoff. Just because this raised the level of production values for erotic thrillers more commonly found on late-night Cinemax doesn't mean that it's truly escaped its tawdry roots."
2,Wrong leading lady,"This movie was extremely overrated. Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas were neither one convincing in their roles. The star of the show, I feel, was Jeanne Tripplehorn. She was the only believable character and her brilliance was what saved the film. The film's only other redeeming quality was the casting of the guy who played Newman on Seinfeld."
3,Basic Instinct Collector Edition,This movie makes Sharon Stone like A Magic artist. She look so sexy. Perhaps i buy it because gift edition. To bad it's made in plastic .. hehehe .. but it's okey i think you didn't do that with a plastik toy.
4,Someone has to Die - Drama/Mystery,"Basic Instinct is a story of a killing that leads police to a collage of unsolved deaths.Detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) is called in to investigate the opening murder scene, only to find the girl friend, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), playful and very indiscreet about prior sexual activities with the dead man. Catherine is a murder/mystery novelist, and quickly becomes the prime suspect when Curran learns the crime has been described in the latest book. Upon further reading he discovers more deaths.The mystery is not without many twists and partly set in some of San Fransisco's forbidden underground locales.This is good entertainment for adult audiences."
3,Business as usual,"One of the greatest of thrillers, this film throws it all overboard for a 'shock' ending. After two hours of mounting tension based firmly on an 'innocent but complex' character reading of the two main characters, the ending reveals that the villain was guilty after all. The psycho killer made fools of us as well as of the cop. It's really been two hours of the swamp monster kills again straight out of z grade movie history and as boring as could be. To compromise your audience like this is, hey, maybe avant garde, guying the thriller conventions and audiences' implicit sadism in watching this kind of stuff. But the film made a lot of money, so I guess the film maker is just showing contempt for his audience after all. Roll up, roll up, and be exploited.And it could have been so good."
3,This is not an unrated version,"I live in Austria and I bought this DVD, because I thought this DVD Version has more scenes. I was very surprised, as I recognized this is not an unrated version. On TV I saw longer sex scenes. The first sex-scene between Michael Douglas and Jeanne Tripplehorn is to much cuted. Also the scenes with Sharon Stone were on the Austrian TV longer. ..."
5,Top Notch Thriller!,"On a scale from 1 to 10, I give this masterpiece a 12!!!Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas team up to make this the ultimate murder thriller. It gets kind of rough in places, but this film works your mind til the very end."
1,Pointless,Why release this on DVD without the extra footage???? I would rate this as a pointless purchase until the director's cut come out on DVD....if it ever does.
5,titanc,it a movie dealing with a love story betewen a lady and a drawing on the ships TITANIC which have been flow down in the ocean
2,Is this a movie or a porn?,"I had heard that this movie was exellent so when i had a chance to see it,i did!And i was surprised to find out how much was exposed,i had heard that Sharon Stone was not ashamed of her body,obviously not! She showed more than i would of liked to have seen.It seems all the movie is about is sex rather than a murder,after the movie is over you will say,""murder?what murder?this movie was supposed to be about a murder mystery!""Sharon Stone did a fantastic job,when she was actually talking instead of climbing all over Michel Douglas!"
1,Wait for a remastered Director's Cut DVD,"Picture quality is substandard. It's certainly not worth the retail price... Even freeze-framing and slow-mo-ing Sharon Stone's infamous ""beaver"" scene gets old after a while."
4,GREAT,"Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas in an erotic thriller. What better do you want from an action movie. The story is well written, enough to keep you intrigued through out all the movie. A similar movie would be 9 1/2 weeks so you get the picture. Quality of the DVD and sound is all very good. Recommended for the lover of this genre."
2,Very Poor Quality DVD Mastering,"I doubt that Artisan even bothered to remaster this DVD release -- it looks like it was either 1) taken directly from the Laserdisc master or (and most likely) 2) taken from a general release print (not the original print) of the movie. What a shame -- Artisan usually produces some great DVD packages, but not this time. Save your . . . money. . . and wait until a better DVD transfer hits the shelves..."
3,I hate when they do this...,"Why do studio keep on doing this, there was the unrated version, than the one with the ice pick. Now this one. But it's not being released until Basic Instinct 2 comes out.This version doesn't have the essay by Camille Paglia. How many version do I have to buy. And studios wonder why profits are down. Thank goodness for bittorrent."
4,What else do you need?,"If you tell me there's a detective movie with Michael Douglas and the most elegant and beautiful woman in cinema both featured, I'm not going to ask anything more. Just buy it. And don't worry about that 'interrogation scene'; it's in there too, not that I had any interest in it (of course.)"
2,Sharon Stone is Beautiful,"A perfect face, perfect body and a perfect crotch. The movie did keep me engaged although the dialog is mostly insipid. Reminded me a lot of commercial copy writing. I found that the movie meandered a lot - like TV serials - with a suspect, then a new villain and then again the old villain. Someone had said that the Director's Cut made it clear what was going on. If you need the Director's Cut to understand the plot, then the movie is a failure. Looking back, the only reason I'd watch this movie again is for Sharon Stone's perfect body. I'd keep the sound muted the next time and have the remote handy for fast forwarding thru."
2,"Campy, laughably bad","Basic Instinct is a very funny movie, though I suspect Eszterhas and Verhoeven may not have intended it to be. The dialog is silly, the plot ridiculous and the sex scenes a riot. Still, because this is one of the best bad movies ever made, I recommend you see it at least once! I have not seen the director's cut and may check it out just to see what I have been missing."
2,"Tedious, tedious read","A friend gave me this book feeling that I would enjoy the way it was written and how Mr. Richardson uses language throughout. She was half right.The twists and little turns of phrase and language were enjoyable, but rare. Instead, uncommon words are used to fill the simple sentences and try to lend some weight to an unremarkable book.Otherwise, the brothers are barely distinguishable, though they have completely different mannerisms. There is nothing that grabs hold of the reader to differentiate between them or any of the guests.If I found it in a $.10 box at a yardsale, I would buy it. Otherwise, it isn't worth the cost of shipping."
4,Make a Reservation to the Bachelor Brother's Bed & Breakfast,"You'll be glad you checked into the Bachelor Brother's Bed & Breakfast. What a delightful read! The twins Hector & Virgil alternate chapters telling tidbits of information and charming stories about their lives, their b&b and people they have met along the way. Thrown in are entries from guests of the B&B. There are many laugh out loud moments. The pictures painted are cozy, light hearted and humorous. Reading it is like curling up into a warm quilt and spoiling yourself with a mug of hot cocoa. I can't wait to read more from this author."
5,Perfect for an escapist weekend,"Bill Richardson is always brilliant. Bachelor Brothers B&B is touching, whimsical, hilarious and eloquent. This is the perfect book for a rainy day at the cottage. The Brothers live in a world where you can embrace life's simple pleasures and leave cynicism, violence, sexism and homophobia at the gate. A great gift for book-lovers, your best friend or your grandmother."
3,a good summer read,"It's a light read--slow paced yet easy to digest, and quirky enough to be worthwile."
2,Why is this book considered so good?,"This book was suggested to our reading group because of its rave reviews. I felt that this book had no character development, no story and had very little to offer. Even the writing style was weak. Why was this novel so highly recommended when there are so many enriching book to encounter?"
2,Pretentious and Dull,"This book was well-written but too ""cute"". The author tried a bit too hard to make each character an eccentric. While I consider myself well-read, the numerous literary references grew tiresome. It is simply not an interesting book and one I quit reading before reaching the end."
2,"""P"" is for Pointless","What a stupid book! I was expecting a good read, but the writing was pretentious and pedantic and the plot was pointless. I'm so disappointed!"
2,Rather tedious,"I'm a great fan of Barbara Pym, Emily Eden, Margaret Oliphant, Anthony Trollope, PG Wodehouse, and similar writers of gentle (and not-so-gentle) social humor. When I found this book, then, I was pleased to find another promising author that seemed to fit this type.The first chapter was amusing enough, written from one of the Bachelor Brother's points of view. Richardson has some very nice turns of phrase and is very good with his imagery. He's also skilled at changing the ""voice"" of the narrator for each chapter. The book very quickly palled for me after that first chapter, though, and it quickly became just a tedious read. I found the characters uninteresting, the setting only mildly engaging, and the overall lack of plot dull.Fortunately, it was also a very short book, which is good for anyone who has to finish whatever book they start. As light summer reading, one could do worse that this light-weight volume, but one could undoubtedly also do better."
4,How can you go wrong with a book about books?,Picked this up at a used book store in Georgia last year and just now got around to reading it. Lovely story of book-loving bachelor brothers who run a B&B and the folks who stay there.
4,Wonderful!,"Gosh I loved this book. I read it in one hit, and ended up with a sore face from smiling the whole way through. The characters are wonderfully eccentric, their stories warm and funny. It could be the perfect book to take your mind off all that troubles you. I just wish the Bachelors and their B&B really existed."
3,pretty good and lighthearted,"This fast paced comedy(for its age) was entertaining and funny. The rich and eccentric family being led by one sane one reminds me of that TV show arrested development. There is even a boxer that wants to turn actor. Its always interesting to see during the depression time how many movies focus on over the top riches, rags to riches, etc. That, I suppose is the American way, Hope for greater things in times of great difficulty. This is true then and now. Enjoy the movie."
3,Mixed feelings about this.,"Being an ex Wisconsin guy where we were taught that Kohler stuff is top notch I was more than a bit dismayed to find this rather pricey faucet was made in China.In it's defense it seems well made and it works very smoothly. We have used it for 4 months and it is a good faucet. The handle does not have to be centered to shut off the water flow, a nice feature.But is isn't made in Wisconsin anymore."
3,Jar opener doesn't work.,"The can opener is a good, solid product. I wish I could say the same for the jar opener. The problem with the jar opener is that it will keep slipping off the lid of whatever it is you are trying to open."
3,Good for lowered expectations,"Son is an intermediate bassoonist. Bought about 30 of these reeds so far from various sources and they are fairly consistent. However, 3 have arrived bad (splits & chips). That's 10% failure rate but all were returned and replacements were fine.About quality: they are not top tier quality, it's obvious and the price reflects that. But they have been CONSISTENT. This means the same minor adjustments are made to them when they arrive (bored out slightly larger & down a little further and tighten up wiring). These adjustments make them good reeds for beginning and intermediate bassoonists. I cannot provide feedback re:suitability for advanced pieces.Right out of the box rating: 2.5. After adjustments: 4/5."
1,Learn how to make your own reeds.,"I played the bassoon in high school and purchased Jones reeds from a local music shop. 1 of 10 reeds I purchased were made properly. Not only did I spend a lot of money buying bad reeds, but it became frustrating playing the bassoon. I later found a professional bassoonist who provided me with handmade reeds and the majority of the issues w/ intonation I had were eliminated.These reeds are fine - I suppose- while you're learning the notes on a bassoon, but that's about it."
2,Jones Bassoon Reed,"I have only been playing the bassoon for about one year, and have found the reed is very important...and sometimes it's very hard to find one that works for you. I have tried about five different brands, with Jones being one of them. I tried only one reed, and found it a bit more toward the medium than the soft, and for me at least it was difficult to play some notes and in general was not fun to play. Again, I am still fairly new to the bassoon, and what works or doesn't work for me may not be the same for others."
4,Wonderful voice,"The lady's quite a singer. I snapped up this CD soon after hearing the lovely title song, which is featured prominently in the great movie 'Big Eden.' White's pure, clear voice reminds me of Dolly Parton. The album contains terrific ballads as well as catchy, foot-tapping tunes. By the way, remember the sculptress whom Tom Hanks meets on a country road at the end of 'Cast Away'? This is her."
4,"If you are a guitar player into blues, you will want this.","This is a very interesting Mayall album showcasing the talents of Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor under Mayall's mentorship. Their are a couple of tracks without any guitar leads as well.If you are a student of 60s guitar playing you will want to hear this. Clapton plays a version of ""Have You Ever Loved a Woman"" that is chilling on this CD. You would swear that he has transformed himself into Freddie King for the gig. Mick Taylor stretches out for a very long solo and explores (probably invents) sitar like blues guitar.The CD was recorded on some kind of bootleg equipment at blues clubs in the mid 60s and the sound quality suffers, but this is still one of my favorite CDs.If you are a Brit Blues fan, buy it."
2,"Only,a historical work!","For me,this cd is only a historical moment,that preceeded the great days of that great group,The Cream! The recorded quality was very poor,not emotionally work!It's only!"
5,tired of all the sarcasm and violence in most kids' movies???,"I bought this after seeing it in the rental store. It looked too cute to pass up. I am always looking for movies that my 3yr. old son will like and that I feel is appropriate. Im tired of all the sarcasm and violence in most kids' movies. This one is pretty innocent, although Lord Licorice could be a little scary for some. I like the vivid colors and happy ending. The music is great too."
5,Great Candy Land book,Service was great. Will order from this place again. Just what I ordered and in perfect shape. Received in timely manner.
4,good movie,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 and now at 6 she still likes to watch it on occasion. I find it a little slow, but I'm not 6!"
4,Better than Expected...,"I bought this for my child because she loves the board game, but had very low expectations for it's quality and story. I was pleasently surprised, however, that it's fairly well done with a good story and excellent music. It has quickly become a favorite. Hope they produce more."
4,This Be Called a Song,"Hey, don't dis this movie because believe it or not, it's a keeper! I took my friend's daughter's to see it a few weekends ago, and I agreed with their first reaction after it ended: ""Holy Moses!"" Sure, the animation is not up to Pixar standards. But there are surprisingly good jokes, lots of spine-tingling thrills (don't let the super-young ones see the evil Lord Licorice!), and basically a family-friendly good time that you will definitely want to replay over and over again. My friend's daughter's are basically teenagers, but after the movie they were inpired to break out the old board game and have a ""Candyland"" tournament. I would've participated but I had a nasty stye that was gumming up my eyelid."
3,Heathen by Shaun Hutson,"Heathen is a perfect example of what a Shaun Hutson book is about, although the storyline leaves much to be desired, as usual, he is a master of description, and can describe a ""feel"" or an ""atmosphere"" better than any author I have read and can convert his words into such a clear mental picture that you feel compelled to keep reading page after page. You will see what I mean as the heroine, Donna, attempts to solve the mystery of the husbands demise. Hutson's books are uncompromising and will go to all lengths to surprise you.This book is well worth reading and I am certain that all readers of the horror genre will enjoy it."
3,ok,"2 bad discs normal 2x burn time on my dvr, maybe different on PC.Bought some maxell for less they seem to be faster."
1,"Teach Tolerance, Not Lies","Promotes a self-serving theory that teens are becoming ""pan-sexual;"" encourages rejection of ""gender-categories;"" and that the ultimate goal for teens should be to feel comfortable having sex with either boys or girls. Irresponsible and damaging to teens who are navigating through normal adolescent experiences. No good can come from the oppressed becoming the oppressor, bending all to their beliefs. Why can't a boy feel close or emotionally connected to another boy without being labeled as ""gay"" or ""bi-sexual?"" i.e., Isn't it possible that a teenage boy who likes fashion is just that: a teen-aged boy who likes fashion? Why is a ""Gay is cool; straight is homophobic"" agenda allowed to predominate in the media? Reprehensible tripe. Teach tolerance, not lies."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY DRIVE FROM IOGEAR,"I've been through two of these drives (IOGear Ion Combo 250GB) in the past 10 days. The first arrived DOA. no big deal, it happens. I ordered the second one from amazon.com, just to start completely fresh, and it stopped working after 5 MINUTES!!!a call to tech support got me even more mad. their solution was to swap drives with me. sounds fair. until i found out it was going to take AT LEAST 10 DAYS FOR THEM TO SHIP IT OUT while they ""work on some drives there!"" so i'm supposed to wait around for them to fix up a refurbished drive and ship it to me in replacement of a drive i paid full price for?i don't think so.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM IOGEAR. 3 year warranty or not, you will be sorry!there's only a star on the rating scale because you have to pick at least one."
2,Proofreader Died Half Way Through.....,"A novel based on a Robert E. Howard character? It must be horrible, you say. I would almost agree with that. The authors here are probably most well known for their Red Sonja series. This story was very predictable and the ending was one large cop-out. Like a lot of fantasy i try to read: bland. And what makes it even worse is that halfway through the novel the spelling mistakes increase until there's almost one per page! Sometimes even multiple misspellings of the same proper noun on the same page!I would recommend this novel only for completists. But please! Put the PB in it's plastic sleeve and put it on your shelf. Look at. Don't read it. Instead, read the Howard originals."
4,The very best of the Dead,"In My opinion, this was the very best of all of their albums. JG's rendition of Morning Due is unsurpassed by anyone including Robert Plants. Just a great song in a great album. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't care for some of the 'bonus tracks' that have been included."
4,better than a lot of other dead stuff,"what I like about this album is that it is straght ahead, blues-oriented music. The songs are just a few minutes (particularly side one), without a lot of that eleven minute long ""noodling"" by The Dead that I find both annoying and extemely BORING. Here it's just blues music with a San Fransisco sound, and they do it well. I only wish the Dead would have stuck more closely to this formula throughout their career. Even if you're not crazy about the Grateful Dead you will like this CD."
3,Remastered Grateful Dead Series Worth the Price,This remastered version of the Dead's first album really bring the music to life. Both the packaging and sound are great. Bonus matieral is interesting. This first album was more of promise of what was to come rather then the full flowering of what this band would be within two years. Some of the songs sound hesitant which can be expected for a first effort.Morning Dew alone is worth the price of admission!
3,The Grateful Dead's first released album,This is actually a pretty good album and it includes some fun early stuff. The songs are not as good as they would come up with later but it does give a good clue as to what the band was doing at that point in their career. Most of the songs on the album were covers. One of the songs - The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion) has been a fan favorite for years. This was also before Robert Hunter came back into the scene to write the lyrics. The new bonus tracks are very good and a nice listen.
4,"*Some OK tunes , but one real prize!*","Some standard blues numbers are everywhere in this album, I think the Dead's first. First bot and listened to it way back in 1968 while in high school. However, the real icing on the cake here is ""Morning Dew"", a really wonderful if simple tune, really drawn out here with by psychodelic guitars. Nifty arrangement! So a ""4"" for a few respectable blues/jugband rockers, and ""Morning Dew"" is all all-time great, definitely my favorite Dead tune!"
4,Hi NRG Trance!,Epic trance track that always amps up the crowd at clubs and raves when DJs add it to the mix. Had to own it.
4,Moondog,Moondog is a nice CD to hear early work by Louis Hardin. The songs are like scetches and very interesting pre-studies for later work.
4,Buckwheat's Zydeco Party,This is very up tempo with a lot of remakes of old standards. Very good overall.
4,Get a grip...they're just corn holders,"To my knowledge, there are two sets of Oxo corn holders -- the regular ""Good Grips"" and the ""Steel"" lines. The ones I ordered from this page and received from Amazon were the ""Good Grips"" and they are black and yellow, like a large bumblebee(28381), the photo here is old. The ""Steel"" ones are black and stainless steel and cost almost twice as much(1050061). They both are great... large and sturdy and I'm satisfied with my Bumble Bees for $6.00. Good product just be aware there are 2 sets and Amazon's set up is a bit confusing. By the way, I store them in a used wine cork in the drawer as they are indeed sharp."
2,Too big for corn dishes,"Yes, their chunky grips make them comfy to hold. BUT, if you use corn dishes (you know, the ones made just for corn, so you can roll your ear in the butter, etc?) these will not work - since their so big they actually hold the corn high up out of the dish! If the ear can't reach the bottom of the dish then there's no butter/salt/pepper, which for me renders these useless.We prefer the Zyliss ones that also interlock (so no poking yourself digging them out of the drawer)!ETA 12/27/09: the link to the ones we prefer -Zyliss Interlocking Corn Holders, Assorted ColorsAlso, 2.5yrs later, ours are still going strong and showing no signs of wear whatsoever (despite being run through the dishwasher all summer long, every summer!)."
4,Not bad,Pretty good.I really like the grip but I think OXO should have made them with 3 spikes instead of 2.I think they would be more stable with 3 spikes.
4,Good but large!,"These corn holders seem very well-built but you should beware of one thing: they're large! If you're like me and had a small corner of your silverware tray reserved for corn holders, you're going to have to find a bigger space."
3,Wrong color,"The picture is of solid black corn holders - I received black and yellow corn holders, which was not what I wanted."
5,Great for kids with little hands!,"These are bigger than some other corn holders I've ownedin the past, and also sturdier. The kids love them. Iwould even pay more than what I paid for these cool gadgets."
5,Just what I expected,The grips came exactly as I had expected them. They are sharp and easy to push and pull into corn because of the rubber grips. I am satisfied.
4,Chilling!,"Barton Royal, a clown in an L.A. bookstore, is obsessed with young boys. He wants to be their father, he even fantasizes how much they will love being together. In an arcade, he spots Billy Neary with a group of friends. Unfortunately, Billy doesn't pay too much attention, even when Barton offers him more money for the games. He finds out where Billy lives and abducts him. It's a disturbing book because it can happen and I'm sure that it does. For any suspense/thriller fans, this book is not to be missed."
3,Overall a good read.,I was not AMAZED by the book but it was an overall good book. Billy was a very smart child. He tried his best to manipulate Barton. Although it took a lot out of him he was very brave in this story. The only problem I had was the last 60 pages or so. The story just got weird. Then at the very last chapter Billy wanted to go somewhere (I don't want to give anything away) and I just thought as a parent that was a little to weird. Overall a pretty good book.
4,Gripping and Suspenseful,"More than just the story of a child abduction, this disturbing novel takes an unsettlingly close look at the twisted mind of the abductor, a man who works as a clown, entertaining small children in a bookstore between crimes. Barton Royal is one of the most frightening and bizarre villians in the annals of fiction. Highly recommended for all but the faint of heart."
5,His absolute best!!,"This book is probably the most suspenseful book I have ever read! Koontz and Saul cannot touch the levels of terror that Mr. Strieber creates in this novel. I've read most of his books, but this is, without a doubt, his absolute best work!"
3,Depressing,I know these type of people exist but reading about child torture and murder is just very unpleasant. The ending certainly isn't happy - just less depressing. This is the first book I threw away rather than pass on to someone else.
3,Glass Art For Dummies,"This book would make a wonderful coffee table book if it weren't so small. The great thing about the book is that we see 74 color plates of Chihuly's work. Chihuly is a genius who manages to create a fireworks display of color and light in glass. Unfortunately, Warmus doesn't know how to write. The book pretends to be unpretentious, but it is, in fact, simple-minded. For example, in the section Warmus calls ""The Merchant of Venetians,"" he writes: ""Chihuly is astonished by these wildly innovative and beautiful pieces from the 1920s and 1930s. Ever the savvy businessman, he knows that their rarity drives collectors to snap them up whenever they become available. He'd love to collect them, but knows they are too rare. How to do it? Eureka! He decides to pretend that he is back in the 1920s and that HE - Dale Chihuly - is creating these priceless items himself!""If you buy this book, look at the pictures. If you decide to actually READ it, have a few strong drinks first."
2,Blind is not great,"The Bamboo roll up blind arrived in decent shape. I wish the company had provided the locations of the hanger loops, and that they were adjustable. My windows have steel frames and drilling new holes requires a powerful drill with a special bit, and paying someone to come and do it. So I threaded heavyweight paper clips through the blind where the hooks are already in the window and the blind is hanging from those. I would give the measurements here, but you can order the exact size blind you want (a plus) so my measurements would not mean much.The blind itself is just OK, a little more see-through than the one I had before, and a lighter color than I expected. The cord broke on the old one and I regret giving it away, because it was a better quality than this one, and cords can be replaced from a hardware store.Not the happiest purchase."
1,Terrible,Stay away from this. First week I blew the sub and they wanted $200 for a replacement sub that is not worth it. Much better subs for allot less money.
1,Terrible Customer Service - Do not buy this item,"I purchased Athena Technologies subwoofer from a e-retailer, and Athena Technologies customer service refused to service the defective subwoofer. I am stuck with a $250 dollar subwoofer that doesn't even power up."
1,"Incredibly awful, very sad","At this point in his career, I have no idea why Miles Davis was playing at all, except perhaps to make money. There's not a single composition on here that's worth hearing; hell, there's hardly anything on here that you'll remember five minutes after the CD is done. Sterile and brainless, this is perfectly representative of the albums he made up until his death. Miles, to be honest, is just going through the motions here. He didn't care about this album, and neither should you.Particular bile goes to the production, which is perfectly harsh and antiseptic, very 80s and very annoying.Overall, this is something no one should inflict on themselves, especially a Miles Davis fan. He had lost it completely by this point."
5,Miles made a great comeback!,"I think the reason people criticized Miles when he retired was because they were just mad that he retired. Miles sounds better than before on a lot of these tracks than before he retired. His tone is still beautiful, better than Wynton Marsalis's, his technique fine, and his improvisations were very creative. There is one song tha didn't quite take, the title track, but that is because of those stupid lyrics, and Miles saves the song, with his great tone, but the electric horn isn't really his thing anymore. He shows great soloing ability on ""Shout"", and the other solos are joyous. On ""Aida"", Miles sounds even better, and the best track is the surprisingly straight ahead jazz track, ""Ursula"". Go buy this album."
2,"So, about that trumpet...","Miles' first studio album after a six-year retirement (though he had previously released the live double We Want Miles) is essentially an attempt to jump on the trends - this is more of an '80s funk record than a jazz album, especially displayed on the title track, with grating if smoothly delivered vocals. Which means this is mainly ponderous and trivial - take the extended ""Back Seat Betty"", which makes use of '80s guitar. Hide me. And too much of it is that insulting style we call jazz-pop which brought Kenny G. success- take ""Aida"" or ""Shout"". Not a stain on Miles' career, thanks to deep, lengthy grooves ""Fat Time"" and ""Ursula"". But one of his least creative."
3,Supportive support,"Despite being only a minimally successful comeback disc met with lukewarm response and featuring a pretty predictable front man job, the band works through six lightly fused jams which are allowed to credibly breathe and therefore hold up better than some late-era material would."
2,"Fat Time, followed by a lot of lean moments","Also known as his 1981 ""comeback"" album (his first recording in 6 years), Miles shows a lot of rust in his playing, and most of the songs indicate he's uncertain as to whether to go for a vintage '70's ""Get Up With It"" style or widen the appeal with forgettable pop songs.Only the opening tune ""Fat Time"" sounds assured. On that track, Mike Stern rips loose an incredible rock guitar solo that ebbs and flows perfectly, with Miller and Foster seeming to egg him on with strong support on bass and drums. Miles' muted horn before and after sounds a little weak, but provides a nice balance to Stern's fire.If you pay full price for this CD, avoid buyer's remorse by not letting the CD player go past track 1. Miles doesn't fully come back until ""Star People"" a couple of years later."
2,very average,the disc starts off on a groove then it goes down hill.the vibe is lost and never picks back up again.The 5 year lay-off seems to have had a Impact on Miles.he was Hit&miss through out the 80's.The Funk of the 70's was Drowned out by the Synth&drum Machines of the 80's.
3,Loyal to A Fault,"What is good is very good, what is not so good is pretty mediocre.The anticipation for this album built up tremendously over the months before its initial release. And what was delivered was a mix bag due to loyalty by Miles to Vince Wilburn and his band.Wilburn - Miles's nephew - was a key musician when Davis began to take tentative steps in getting his career going again. Wilburn was there for Davis as he began the long road to condition himself to play the trumpet and develop musical themes.That Wilburn and his group played a major role in the album is not surprising because of the loyalty Davis had with musicians and friends. But it is that loyalty which makes the album so uneven.The reviews then were mixed at best and perhaps a tad better than they should have been due to the return of Miles. But the music in the studio and on tour afterwards showed that Miles would always be ""The Man With The Horn."""
2,bitten by the 80s,"Sorry- I don't really like this album. It sounds like 80s elevator jazz. If you want to hear some kickin' versions of some of these songs, get We Want Miles."
5,Classic Miles...,"After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to write this one in fairness to this record. This CD is truly great classic Miles and will sound as fresh in 2081 as it did in 1981. I strongly feel that this music will prove the people that said Miles had lost it in the 80's to be fools who did not understand what Miles was trying to express in his new music. The art is in the silent space, which forms around the notes and creates a fresh sound and rhythm. This CD is a must for anyone who wants to hear Jazz in a true art structure, and Miles is truly a master painter of time, space and sound. This CD will have its place in music history; the question is, are you mentally ready for a dimensional ride to your next growth in music. If so, sit back with this one and truly expand your soul. - Audiostar"
3,fat time is the best,"fat time rips. decoy is a better album, no question, but fat time rips the upholstery off any song from decoy. all in all, a man with the horn is a lot less even than decoy. if you have to choose, I guess you know which one I'd recommend (decoy)"
5,Fat Time For A Comback,"After seven years in oblivion Miles Davis returns with""The Man With The Horn"",who's sappy tital cut is actually theworst cut on the album.But it's in the dreary funk of thevintage ""Fat Time"",the hard rocking ""Back Seat Betty"",thegalvinizingly contemporary ""Shout"" and the artful ""Aida"" thatassures Miles was back and back to stay.It's tital track is,therefore,a forgivable sin."
3,Talkative Violette and Mr.B!,I love the details and coaching that go into dancing ballet therefore I enjoyed this DVD.....however Violette loves to talk! The first half of the DVD is Violette talking in rapid French to dancers while they dance a little (don't worry there are English sub-titles). The second half of the DVD has a lot more ballet and less talk.This DVD is a good addition for someone who love Balanchine's ballet - as I do. Violette gives insights into the steps and motivations behind the steps. Also the 'grainy' videos of Violette dancing the ballets herself are wonderful......what a beautiful dancer Violette was.....not many dancers have her grace and fluidity....there is much more anxiety about technique in many of today's ballet dancers.
4,Probably THE best book for the casual student,"If you're a Christian who wants to learn a little Greek, this would be the perfect book to use. It doesn't overwhelm the reader with rules and paradigms but gives brief, straightforward explanations followed by LOTS of exercises. Most of the exercises are in columns with the Greek on the left and the English on the right making it simple to cover the answer while you translate, then check your answer immediately. In later chapters, Greek quotes from the New Testament are used in the exercises.One of the problems with this book is that some of the exercises refer you to the Greek New Testament (GNT) which means you'll have to buy a GNT to complete those exercises. Also, some of the longer translations don't have an answer key.Finally, if you want to become a serious Greek student, you'd probably want something a little more thorough than this."
4,Helpful,"I love the intuitive way that this book introduces its students to the Greek alphabet. I was worried that it would take me a long time to memorize the sounds of each character, but Dobson's book explained things perfectly. I highly recommend this book for a beginning Greek student."
3,Question,HelloI am not reviewing that book. I clicked on the SEARCH INSIDE option to see the contents of that book and I saw no Greek letters but only a kind of transliteration. Am I right ? I have some suspicion since a reviewer says there are no greek letters in that book. Thanks for the answer.
1,Don't forget to buy the book too!,Would have enjoyed this tape more had I known it was to accompany the book. Now I guess I'll buy the book and tell you more later.
2,Absence of accent marks makes learning Greek more difficult,"I recently bought a copy of Dobson's Learn New Testament Greek. Having studied Greek before, I was surprised to find that the Greek words in this text have no accent marks. This makes learning the language much harder because you cannot be sure you are pronouncing the words with the accents on the correct syllables. I would recommend that beginning students of Greek look elsewhere, and make sure whatever book you purchase contains accent marks so you can learn to pronounce the words properly as you study."
3,"Great book, audio heavily Anglicized","I would have preferred more modern/ethnic pronunciation, and it even seems that to an extent, the speakers are making the attempt, but it's a long ways off."
4,a very good instructional book on tape recorded interviews,This book is a very good instruction manual on the tape recorded interview. He talks about both the technical and nontechnical aspects of the interview. It is an excellent primer for the starting interviewer. I recommend it highly.
5,Apt title,"Many of the pioneers of electronic pop have been acknowledged in the past few years, but nobody says much about Yello (at least in the U.S.). This record may not have been groundbreaking like Kraftwerk, but it is tremendously entertaining. It is eclectic, adventurous, and very funny. It has that smart/stupid dynamic that works so well for Fatboy Slim. I won't vouch for subsequent Yello records, but I just love this one."
5,"Bizarre album - eclectic yes, but definitely bizarre",This album starts off in a usual Yello fashion ( although at that time it wasn't really known ) which is bright and breezy yet still a little quirky but then right about in the middle of the album things begin to get a little weird. The moody instrumentals give a sense of unease and by the time Assistant's Cry comes it completely knocks itself over with Dieter Meier sounding a bit like he's got a few screws loose somewhere and then oddly reverts back to how it was originally but somehow nothing feels the same - you're somehow waiting for the next creep out which never comes. They never quite did this again.....
3,"It's pretty good, but not their best.","This album is certainly a fun listen, as with all of their albums. But it lacks a certain thickness their later albums such as 'You Gotta Say Yes' and 'Stella' have. A lot of the songs are very short, at least, and it keeps you listening with an interest when the songs change frequently. Bostich is the highlight, with it's innovative rhythms and Macereana like verse. This album is for true fans only, if you like bostich get it on one of their greatest hits (Essential, New Mix in one go)."
3,Too wierd,"I'm a great Yello fan and I simply love their music, at least most of it. When I listened to Solid Pleasure it was almost only wierd, with no meaning in the music (exept for Bostich and Eternal Legs which are great!), I almost got headache of it. Ofcourse, this was their first CD and Yello has just become better and better, so I think this first CD was a sort of beginner album (now they know what they have to do to make good music). For you who want good Yello music, I recommend Baby, Flag, Essentials or One Second."
3,Good on It's Own,"Clint Black's second CD is pretty good on it's own merits, but pales in comparison to his debut. The title song is terrific, and ""Gulf of Mexico"" is a beautiful ballad. Also on the plus side is the great traditional country sound - it's not the kind of boring, easy listening stuff that many country stars are recording today. However, most of the songs simply don't stand out in the same way as the hits on his debut CD did. Overall, a good country CD that will likely satisfy fans of Clint Black and more traditional country music."
5,Greatest of Them all,"I think if there is anyone that knows about country music at all, they will tell you that Clint Black is by far the best country singer of all times in this era. The country music of today has lost all of its meaning, as hard as it may sound, todays country music sounds like Roll & Roll as well as some carvial music. There are stories to be told in country music, there is love stories that are talked about country songs, there is real life facts of life in country songs, and Clint Black has kept that tradition going right on in his music, all of this other wild so-called country music needs to go back to the drawing board and start over, Start out by talking to the Forefathers of the country music, like George Jones, Conway, Mel Tillis, and so on. However Clint can even give one a few lessons about great country music, I know what I am speaking of I've been listening to country music every since I was 4-years olds. Keep up the good work Clint Black."
3,awkward and preachy,"I suppose it's to be expected that a convert is going to be preachy. I felt that the characters were mere mouthpieces for a monologue that the author wanted to deliver about Islam. We have the wise, accepting, progressive, gentle-giant Imam, we have the violent, racist, fundamentalist, sexual abuser brother, we have the oh-so-sensitive lead who learns the true meaning of standing up for himself, we have the too-too beautiful boyfriend. Yawn. The characters were all fluent in psychobabble at various times, even the generally mute mom suddenly bursts forth with her own stream. All that said, it was readable and certainly not your average story. I give it points for the concept, but it reads like a first draft, awkward and unpolished."
3,Stop me if you've heard this one before,"Familiar theme. Good guy is a London cop. While investigating a complaint, he finds it may involve British and maybe American intelligence services. Although warned off officially and with threats, his professional pride and personal(sexual) interest won't let him quit his investigations. Positives: (1) the characters, especially the minor ones, are well presented as individuals, (2) plot keeps moving along well. Negatives: (1) attempt to combine police procedural and spy thriller just doesn't work. (2) even 30 years ago, a lot of the plot elements were cliches -- example: bad guys gimmick the hero's car to blow him up, but nice guy hero lends car to friend who gets killed instead."
2,too expensive for what you get.,"This product provides just 10 feet of track and a car for $30 dollars. It should cost $5. Do not buy, as it is simply too expensive. $30 should get at least 100 feet of track."
5,amazing beats-- and feats!,"Anything Mr. Miles Tackett is involved in is nothing less than wonderful. From the earliest sessions with the Inclined up to any of his latest efforts, I am always impressed!"
3,stainable stainless steel,I ordered this because I like Oxo products but this stainless steel is not stainless anymore than the one I bought at the grocery.
4,Nice Kitchen Gadget,"-Easy grip handle is great-Spread all kinds of foods very well-Alittle bigger blade than I like, but still very nice-Cuts wellGreat Gadget to have in any kitchen, dorm room or in break room at work."
5,Fantastic Spreader,I dont know how I spread icing on cakes prior to having this spreader! It is fantastic!
2,Mayonnaise makes it Rust!,"Having read a few negative reviews, I was extra careful when I purchased the GoodGrips spreader one year ago. It never soaked in water, and it never saw the insides of my dishwasher. After using it three times, it rusted. The cause? Mayonnaise!With the exception of the serrated edge, the rust was easily removed with Barkeeper's Friend, which can be found at better super markets."
3,Great at what they're advertised...,"... but you'll want to hand wash and dry these. We don't like hand washing and drying but as others have stated, these do show rust spots after prolonged water contact. Stainless steel shouldn't rust, right? We love Oxo products but these leave a bit to be desired on the maintenance front."
3,blade has rust,"As others have noted, my blade does rust when I run it thru the dish washer....other then that, I love to use it. I had a stoke, and my right arm is only 85% back, so I use this to cook...."
4,Great for Breakfast,"I purchased a few of these. They are great for spreading margarine or cream cheese on my bagel at breakfast. Also, great for things like peanut butter. I would have given it a five star review, the only negative is price. I think $6.99 is closer to the value of this item."
3,Variable Quality,"Nice, but somewhat large spreader. I bought two of these about 8 months ago. One started to RUST and discolour within 2 months, the other one still looks like it did when new. Due to the inconsistency in the quality control and quality of metal plating of this fine product I can only give it an average 3 star rating."
1,Stainless steel?,"First time we washed these in dishwasher rust appeared on blades. The blades are marked ""stainless steel"".Very disappointed, other OXO products we have purchased were of good quality."
2,Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaky and too big!,"All I can say is SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAK!!! This thing has been used a lot -- probably 50 times in the 3 years we've owned it, but that's no excuse. It shouldn't squeak a really high, really loud squeak every time it rotates, regardless of pressure, tilt or speed. It's also ungainly and heavy. Yes, it cuts well, but it's not worth the hearing loss and awakened baby that occur each time we cut pizza with it. Trashed."
4,Solid and Heavy Pizza Slicer,"I was a little concerned about this product after reading the reviews which indicated the unusual size. However, this pizza cutter is great. I have now used it on my own creation which I cook on a stone and on a pizzeria-bought pie that needed re-slicing. Cut through them both like butter. The size does not get in the way and you really don't even have to press down too hard because of the solid weight of this ""pizza wheel"". I am very satisfied but I removed one star due to the fact that the wheel/blade cannot be removed. It would have been fairly easy for Oxo to make this product with a removable blade for thorough cleaning and for ease of sharpening. I'm disappointed about this. If the bushing or rivet fails down the road, I will probably design my own removable replacement. Last but not least, I really appreciate the quality of Oxo products. I've got a kitchen full of them."
3,RUST IN CENTER,"WHILE THIS CUTS THROUGH PIZZA AS ADVERTISED, THE CENTER OF WHEEL IS NOT STAINLESS STEEL AS ADVERTISED. MINE STARTED SHOWING RUST IN CENTER OF WHEEL AFTER 10 WASHINGS!"
5,"Great, large pizza cutter","I broke my roommate's pizza cutter and got sick of cutting pizza with a knife (very difficult), so decided to purchase this one. It is pretty large, very sturdy and cuts through pizza on the first try. I have mostly used it with thin crust pizza, but it seems sharp and strong enough to use with thicker pizza as well. It is also very easy to hold with the soft grip handle. Love it!"
4,Big and comfortable,"My Husband loved this pizza cutter the moment he took it out of the box. The bigger size looks good and works well, and the grip is comfortable. Fairly easy to clean."
2,Cheap Cable- bad quality-Avoid,"Cable was cheaply made. I gave it a try anyway. I used it as a cable for auxillary input of my stereo, never played with it once installed. a few months later, it is dead! Buy from a different place!"
1,I never received this item.,"I did not receive this item as of 2-13-10. The local post office said that they could not prove that the package was delivered, and said that they did not care, there was nothing they could do for me. I emailed the Jay at Citi electronics and he said that they would reship the order but as of yet I have not received it."
3,Lid leaks,"Very nice product, well built, but water leaked from the lid while driving. Lid seems very tight but still water leaked inside my vehicle when driving."
3,Never quite takes off,"The Nietzschean philosophy of two villainous schoolboys is the best thing about ""Murder By Numbers"", and that it's explored so superficially is one of the film's major disappointments. The script seems more interested in establishing Sandra Bullock's likable, quirky and oversexed homicide detective Cassie Mayweather, but ultimately does very little with her except tack on a backstory resolution which is only tangentially related to the case. As it stands, ""Murder By Numbers"" plays like the fusion of teen thriller and small town romance, and the result isn't really satisfying on either level. Still, it looks superb and veteran director Barbet Schroeder at least keeps things moving. The performances are solid. Bullock plays her most interesting role since ""28 Days"", Michael Pitt adds another rendition of the deeply-troubled-sexually-ambiguous-teen to his resumé, and Ryan Gosling gives a promising performance as his manipulated pal."
1,Bland Bullock,"Sandra Bullock once again proves that she cannot handle a role with any depth. She is unconvincing as a tough detective. Her toughness just comes across as an actress reading a script. I suppose she got this role because she is listed as an executive producer, or something of that ilk."
3,Interesting Murder Mystery!,"I did enjoy the film, ""Murder By Numbers"" for its way of totally messing with your mind and confusing you right up until the end of the film. I thought that Ryan Gossling did an excellent job with his role as a pompous, rich, teenage potential murderer. I feel that Sandra Bullock's being cast in this film was a mistake. Yes, she did choose a role that went against the grain and was different, but I don't think she pulled off the attitude and anguish of her character very well. She seemed like she was overplaying the role. The entire time I watched the movie in the theater I kept thinking, ""Someone else should be playing this role.""Other than that one criticism, I think ""Murder By Numbers"" is a good movie that will leave you guessing and scratching your head in confusion right until the very end!"
2,Not worth your time,"I rented, I saw, I forgot in 10 minutes. This is all I can say.Boys are good actors (thus 2 stars), mrs. Bullock is, sorry to say, not."
3,NOT the widescreen version,"I was very excited to order this movie as I loved it when I first saw it. However, I was looking for the widescreen version and ended up finding this. The description of the disc tells you that it is widescreen but when you click on the picture it says FULL screen version. Be careful if you prefer widescreen to full screen and always double check the descriptions with the actual photos."
2,Not the most original film,"""Murder by Numbers"" is based on the real life Leopold-Loeb case of the 1920's and the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock movie ""Rope' although it doesn't credit either. The plot involves 2 upper class and intelligent students planning and executing the perfect murder on a random victim for the thrill and the challenge. In the real life case and the Hitchcock movie, the murderers are college students while in this movie, they are alledgedly high school students. The word alleged is used as it is obvious that Gosling and many of his classmates are in their 20's and haven't seen a high school for a few years there.The best thing going for this movie is the lead performance from it's star Sandra Bullock. She is good as the detective in pursuit of the twisted murderers but she has very little to work with here as far as the script, the cliched characters and the weak plot twists. She's a good actress but not a magician and this would fall into her lesser movies and possibly her least."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed because this was supposed to be a new movie and I expected it to be packaged that way. It was not. It did come sooner than expected, however."
3,Murder by Numbers,It was interesting but slow at times.Bullock was good.I have recommended this movie .
3,"Filmed in Morro Bay, California",This film was mediocre but I enjoyed watching it because it was filmed in one of my favorite vacation spots -- Morro Bay.
1,a reality check ?,"The story seemed interesting, and I expected a much better film; it just kept getting worse as the film continued.Bullock's character was just too unbelievable; the only possibly credible characters would be the two high school students.Reviewer J.D. wrote a good review, much of which reflects my own thoughts about this film: editing and lighting were not as good as they could have been; directing was lousy. And indeed this film is not as thrilling as believed: it is really stupid.A total disappointment. Hollywood needs a reality check."
3,ok movie,"well, i got this movie thinking it would be good cause i enjoy thrillers and especially love mike pitt and think hes a pretty good actor and i like sandra bullock but this movie [wasn't very good]. it keeps you interested till the last 20 min then it makes no sense at all and the special effects or whatever they use for the final scene look so unbelievable and so corny. i dont know i just didnt get this movie, it was pretty boring and it wasnt good. highest it deserves is 2 or 3 stars, i purchased this movie i recomend you dont purchase it . you will watch it once then never again most likely."
2,Sandra Bullock in trouble ...,"Not so much the movie, but here career apparently. Reese Witherspoon and Cameron Diaz must be scaring the hell out of Bullock and Meg Ryan cuz they stopped doing those perky comedies that they did well. Put them in something else, like this one, and whew is it tough to watch! Plus there are way too many holes in this one to really make it work. A couple of good moments, but a bargain rental at best."
2,The numbers don't add up,"Sandra Bullock as a hard-boiled homicide detective has a few hurdles to jump before the movie begins. This is one of those Leopold and lobe (spelling?) type partner thrill-kill situations to be solved by Bullock. Of course, all the other cops go with the trail of clues, while Bullock's hunches always see the truth. She has some inner-demons, but it wasn't very moving. The story has that feel of we've seen all of this before... and it was done better the last three times. This wasn't all that bad- it just wasn't all that good considering the star and the director. The criminals' story got old fast, and the believibility was strained by the end. Bullock's performance reminded me of Holly Hunter as a detective in Copycat where I never got over the mis-casting. Ok for a movie rental, but if I had seen it in the theater I might be more negative. I like the idea of Bullock trying more gritty drama, but she just doesn't cut it as a tough detective."
3,only one thing to say,the packaging was great but there was way to much tape on the dvd to keep it closed. since the case is cardboard while taking the tape off it ripped in a few places on the case. not cool :/
3,MURD3R 8Y NUM8ERS,"Homicide cop Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock, who also executive produced)discovers the body of a female strangulation victim wrapped in plastic. But the problem with the investigation is that two rich kids, Michael Haywood (Ryan Gosling from BELIEVER) and Justin ""Bonepart"" Pendleton (Michael Pitt) have planned the murder and are observing the cops as they uncover each clue they have planted for them.Directed by Barbet Schroeder (SWF, BARFLY) MURDER BY NUMBERS sometimes echoes Hitchcock's ROPE. Gosling and Pitt are good as the rich kids whose ""perfect murder"" turns out to be anything but. The planning behind the murder will fascinate crime buffs, and MURDER BY NUMBERS basic premise is helped considerably by strong performances from Gosling and Pitt; though the movie tends to fluctuate a bit in the last half hour. Still recommended. Luciano Tovoli's atmospheric photography aids greatly in helping maintain viewer interest."
2,good premise-poor execution,"The idea was good, two young high schoolers plot the perfect murder. Sandra Bullock plays the cop/profiler who disses shrinks and has serious issues of her own. Half the time Bullock seems slightly psycho and the other half totally confused. Her reaction in certain situations don't seem believable, like when one of the suspects catches her photographing him. She didn't act like a cop. I don't think she had a good handle on her part. Every character was a stereotype and the script worked too hard at shoving in twists and turns at every opportunity. Save your money...it will be on t.v. soon enough."
1,Dumb and depressing!,This movie is so boring that I like literally found a cure for caffeine overload! Nothing is worth pointing out because there is virtually nothing worth watching iwth this film. Nothing else to say but that this crime borer is one to pass up.
3,Columbine Meets Dostoyevsky,"A worthy film showcasing a serious role for Sandra. Ms. Bullock does very well but I kept expecting her to break out and smash somebody, which regrettably never happens.A fine job by the two high school killers (Gosling and Pitt, no relation). The motivation for their acts is quite similar to Rodion Raskolnikov's in Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"", without the poverty. Throw in the Columbine connection of rich-kid ennui, the ""Burning Bed"" PTSD of Bullock's character, and a fine performance by her tough boss, and you get a movie that is better than most. Worth a watch if the special effects extravaganzas are leaving you in need of a break."
2,Great Irony,"My favorite thing about ""Murder by Numbers"" was the irony: The very thing the guilty boys were doing to mislead the police-red herring after red herring-was the very thing the producers/directors of the movie were doing to mislead the viewers into thinking they were watching a good movie."
3,perdictable but still entertaining,"lacks in the old Hollywood formula with a lot of movies and by the finale its really perdictable.though the performances by Ryan Gosling as Richard and Michael Pitt(Bully, Finding Forrester) help this one out big time...Sandra Bullock(Speed and the crappy sequel Speed 2:Cruise Control) is good but its not her best performance...its her best effort to her best work but its not that great...plus the only reason I watched this is that the great Ben Chaplin(Lost Souls, Birthday Girl) is in this movie as Bullocks partner Sam. directed by Barbet Schroeder(Single White Female, Desperate Measures). also stars R.D. Call(Last Man Standing) and Sean Penn's brother Chris Penn(The Florentine, Rush Hour)..good for its time"
3,Interesting psychological thriller,"Murder by Numbers is an interesting psychological thriller. The story is inspired by the Leopold and Loeb crime of the 1920's and does a good job of using both the main premise of that crime and some of the subtler details. I thought Sandra Bullock did a good job with this dramatic role, which was a nice departure from her more usual romantic comedy. The backstory for Bullock's character added a nice twist to the story, but it could have been incorporated more smoothly."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","I wasn't sure what to expect from the movies. I have been a fan of Ryan Gosling's since his Young Hercules days, so I couldn't wait to see him in the totally different role than the teen hero.I wasn't disappointed by either Gosling or Michael Pitt. I thought their portrayals were excellent. It was Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin who were disappointing. Bullock frayed my nerves while Chaplin was uninspiring.The twist at the end was both unexpected and thrilling. Who knew one could feel pity for a murderer?"
2,Girl Power at the Expense of Society,This movie tries to force the viewer to sympathize and even praise the efforts of a detective who uses criminals to satisfy her feelings of revenge for injustices in her own past. Such are the ethics we admire?!
1,Dull and Predictable Thriller,"Extremely boring and unconvinced crime thriller in which two psycho teenagers commited a murder just to prove to them selves that they are genious. But they have to confront smart police officer (played with no intensity by Bullock)who take up the investigation of the gruesome case. Predictable, dull and unsuspenseful. A waste of time, in fact."
5,"Trust me, this movie does not Murder people By Numbers!","This movie isn't boring. It's actually telling people about how the ""perfect murder"" can be achieved without being caught. And aside from this, it tells of Cassie Mayweather, and her frightening past. This movie does tell who the murderers are in the beginning, but the real thing you have to figure out is WHO actually did the killing. This movie is one (of many) of Sandra Bullock's all best....It'll keep you on the edges of your seats."
1,Mandolin Abstractions,"Some selections in this album are interesting, but for the most part, we didn't care for it. There is very little melody. We would classify this album as ""experimental"" music. I'm sure these pieces are hard to play on the mandolin, but the results are not particularly pleasant to listen to."
2,Reaching Your Potential,Useful for those who need a hands on approach to understanding their personal and professional development.I personally found the exercises boring and too time consuming
1,More like a nightmare,"I had great hopes that this book would help me decipher my dream about Mr. Bubbles in a spork fight with Chita Rivera at the Copa while I was playing ""Ooops I did it again"" on the bagpipes. However, this ""guide"" could offer me no help other than labelling me dangerously insane. Now honestly, what kind of help is that?"
1,childish nonsense,"the producers ofthis book are aboutas depraved as any I have seen inrecent recollection.If you enjoy reading 'fortune cookie' one liners and horoscopefiction, you might find a fewinteresting concoctions but don'tbet on it pitiful waste of paper!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED to say the least,"I prefer quality not quantity.The author needs to pay more attention to detail instead of barely touching the surface on so many dreams. so I suggest he writes a book on 5,000 dreams with a lot of detailed answers. I also suggest trashing this poor excuse of a book trying to Interpret Dreams. I have."
1,Dont waste your money,"Having been given this book as a present by a well meaning family member, I am constantly irritated by it when trying to interpret a dream. The categories are limited and very outdated. Many modern conveniences are not listed. So you can't interpret them. The writer seems to have had a pre-occupation with young girls because almost every enttry ends by saying that : ""If a young girl should dream of .... "" and then goes into the most amazing complex series of what she should dream. There is no similar reference to similar meanings for older women or men of any age. I strongly recommend against buying this book."
2,"10,000 Dreams","Seems fantastic, in some respects. Dreams are not as easy to interpret as many of the new age dreamweavers suggest. Readers of this book should balance the content against other compelling perspectives, e.g., DREAMS by KALLMYER is an excellent book which provides a scholarly, yet practical view that is sure to challenge the reader."
1,Don't give your power away to a dream dictionary like this,"If I were in favor of burning books (which I am not) I would throw this one onto the pyre first. It is the most retrogade kind of dream dictionary. Instead of letting other people take your power away by telling you what your dream symbols mean, why not learn some fresh techniques for unfolding the messages for yourself? I recommend books like Robert Moss' ""Conscious Dreaming"" or Jeremy Taylor'w work, which stress the fact that YOU are the expert on your own dreams. In Moss' books, you are encouraged to go back INSIDE your dreams and gather more information, dialogue with dream characters and awaken to a larger reality. Why settle for a stuffy, fuddy, outmoded set of ""traditional"" readings when this HUGE adventure is waiting for you?"
2,Extremely Archaic,Have used this book on and off for 5 years and have decided to trash it. You can tell that there are so many items that are from the early 10th century (I have no clue what some of the items within the book are just glancing around...) He doesn't interpret color or things that could be common (like a dress or a mop or washing a floor).
2,More like a horoscope than interpretation...,"This book is more like a horoscope in that it gives you a list of items and events that occur in dreams, and tells you what your future may hold based upon their appearance in your dream. It doesn't explain what they might mean in a more concrete sense; what does it mean that you are dreaming these things, what issues do you need to address? What is weighing on your mind? Instead, it is much like going to a palm reader."
1,two thumbs down,"Wast of money!! This book did not do it for me, it is so negitave you can almost predict what the interrpretation will be before you read it."
2,GOOD FOR PARLOR GAMES,"I recommend Betty Bethard's Dream Book, isbn 0967979013, if you really are interested in dreams and their meaningIt has the same format, but it written intuitively by her You might discover that you learn more about yourself from this book than many others, which are often a conglomeration of others"
5,Great Leaf grabber :),"I Bought this to replace my little 1 1/4 inch hose. Cleaning out my basement while we are finishing it, nothing gets sucked up and it kept getting clogged. This has solved my problem. I have also used it to clean leaves, and dust/dirt out of my garage."
4,Dizzying skill!,The Stars and Stripes Forever makes you wonder how only ten fingers can play all of those parts...single take (because its live)! The whole album is great listening. Do yourself a favor and pick up this classic. I had it on vinyl and thought it was lost to me until I found the cd on Amazon.
2,Oxo Good Grips Can Opener Fails to Please,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener, Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also, the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener, so dishwater accumulates in them, and therefore so do rotting food particles, mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces, but what a pain! And then, the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months, I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich, after six months, still works very well."
4,Long Lasting Can Opener,"I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it. It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part). Due to the design, I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models. I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned. The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally, but this has not been problematic as of yet. All and all it has been a good product and if I ever needed a new one, I would be willing to buy this same model again."
4,Better than other can openers,"Easy to turn, easy on the hands. Much better than the cheap metal-handle ones I had purchased previously. One minor complaint: I put it in the dishwasher with the blade end down, and a little white stuff then leaked out of the long handles and stained some of the metal. I think it is just glue residue. I cannot scrub it off. Fortunately, the white stuff doesn't come off on cans or food, and it hasn't affected the usability. I cannot remember whether I put it on the top rack or the bottom rack of the dishwasher.I would still buy it again, because it is better than others."
3,Not the best can opener I have ever owned,"This is only a passable item. I find that the rubberized grips tend to come off in my hand and the blade and lip-grip do not grasp the can sufficiently or consistently. Compared to other OXO products, this was a big disappointment."
2,Can't open oddly shaped cans.,"Although this is a fairly ergonamic and durable can opener, the oversized handles make it nearly impossible to open straight-edged cans, such as sardine cans.If you ever need to open oddly shaped cans make sure you have another can opener in the house."
1,Rusts,"This product had noticeable rust after the first few weeks. After a few months, it was so rusty it was hard to open and close. The other day it literally broke in two from the rust. We have not had it for that long. This product is total garbage, unlike most Good Grips products (esp. the super potato peeler)."
5,can opener,came highly recommnended--we both like it very much---would definitely recommend to other customers--great can opener--we always purchased lower priced can openers.
5,"So far, so good","Very easy to turn, doesn't take much space, reasonably priced. No problems with it so far. I have avoided putting it in the dishwasher though."
5,Pain free can opening!,"After months of buying dollar store to expensive can openers I finally found one that works well with ease, does not break after one use, and is good for those arthritically challanged.It does not rust either. I have had mines for over a year now."
5,Everyone needs one.,"For what it is, it's perfect! Every kitchen and emergency supply kit should have a manual can opener. The old kind, without all the ergonomics and padding, were uncomfortable to use; this one's a breeze. It arrived within 10 days of ordering, and is exactly as advertised."
2,Not a left handed can opener,I bought this can opener for my daughter who is left handed. This is not a left handed can opener and is exactly the same as the one we already had that is difficult for her to use.
2,one of the 5 can openers i broke in a year,"i thought it would last but did not, the twist handle broke after trying to open a can of tomato sauce"
2,Mine broke after 2 months,This can opener worked great until the knob broke off. I only had it for 2 months. Nothing is made to last anymore :/
1,A Real Disappointment,"This can opener is a real disappointment to us. We have happily used this brand on other utensils, but this one is sub-standard. The ""Good Grips"" slip off. This can opener stalls while trying to open a standard can of beets, and had to be reset and started again several times leaving beet juice splatters all over the counter. We returned this item for a refund."
2,"Bad ""Good Grips""","This can opener worked great for about 6/7 months and then quit. It said it was dishwasher safe, but it rusted. Even WD-40 couldn't help. Don't buy this one - unless it for a gift for someone you don't like."
2,Not much stainless steel in this one,"Length:: 0:45 MinsWhen I bought this can opener a few years ago, it was labeled ""Stainless steel"". It has since been relabeled with ""stainless steel blade"". Most can openers have a stainless blade, so this is nothing special in that regard. It was used for about 2 years in a normal kitchen household environment with a good EPA-approved water supply (no salt, no private well, etc). Way too much rust for me."
1,"After about a year, handle is too hard to turn",Worked well for a while - but no better than the usual steel hardware store model. The shape of the turning handle may look appealing but it is not particularly ergonomic. Its sloping ends tend to encourage fingers to slide off.After a while (a year?) it is very difficult to turn the handle even when the can opener is not on a can. Essentially unusable. I am looking for a new one.
3,Okay for a can opener,"Nothing extraordinary. It opened cans smoothly for about four months before I had any problems with rusting. The annoying things about it are the handles. The knob is large and hollow, and collects water, making it frustrating to remove from the dishwasher without drenching yourself. The soft handle covers slip off easily, and fill with water as well. It does its job, but I would never buy another one."
1,Book Sister Betty,"I hate not finishing a book. It was so awful, after the 5th attempt at reading it, I gave up.It was a book picked for my book club reading. uuggg!!!!"
1,Disappointing,This was my book club's August selection and it was not a good read. The author seemed to ramble on about nothing. I tried on several occasions to complete the book - but could not. I did not find it funny or entertaining. Hope the next one is better.
1,BORING,"I found this book to be very boring. When I picked this up, I thought it would be a funny book about church characters. The church and its characters were a little unrealistic. I had a hard time finishing this book. I am glad I picked it up from the library instead of spending money on it."
2,Not Too Engaging!,"Teachers in Touch had a difficult time discussing this book. Most of the members could not relate to the language used by the author and had a hard time finding the humor. One member actually liked the book and said she laughed through her reading. Overall, our ratings averaged 1.5, but we'll round up to a 2."
5,The Truth is the Light,"I have to admit I wasn't going to write this review because I thought the other reviewers said it all. However, I finally decided to add my two cents.I'm still laughing at this book. I'm glad I read the other reviews and purchased a copy. Not only is this author a great writer but an amazing comedienne. I must admit that if someone doesn't have a sense or humor or understand satire the humor will be lost on them.The premise of the title story is that Sister Betty gets a phone call from God. After an afternoon of mishaps that ultimately reveal that she never knew the true meaning of being a Christian Sister Betty sets off on a path to enlighten the other members of her church. It will not be easy.I found it refreshing that the messages of God's love can be brought out in such an amazing and hilarious manner and I applaud the author."
1,Couldnt finish it,"I couldnt FORCE myself to read past chapter one. This is a horrible attempt at comedy. All the stupid names got on my nerves and the language was so juvenile. This is a pre-teen book. I will never read another book from this author again.I wish there was a rating less than 1 star, I wouldly surely give this book a negative 1 or less."
2,"Sing Steve, Sing!",Yes Steve Wariner is a masterful guitar player but it was excruciating listing to this album knowing that I wouldn't be hearing his wonderful voice (except for one song). I love Steve Wariner as a music talent and he should never put out an album again unless he plans to sing too. I have to admit that many of the instumentals are soothing but it just wasn't the same without him singing.
4,Vac bags,I received the products as advertised in proper condition and in the alloted time. All was well done.
5,live/dead,"Behind the awesome cover lies an even better CD, full of classic grateful dead songs. Each song is a masterpiece, particularly ""Dark Star"", ""Turn on Your Lovelight"" and ""Death don't got no mercy"". When I close my eyes while listening to ""Dark Star"", the music creates a Fantasia-like scene, kinda like that animation at the beginning of the Grateful Dead movie except i see someone floating deeper and deeper into space, and then towards the end of the song returning to earth. Well worth 23 minutes. ""Turn on your lovelight"" is another awesome song, it makes you just want to dance! ""death dont have no mercy"" is a blues type song with exellent music and singing. this cd is definitely worth buying."
1,Punish Your Teenager,"After forty year's of trying to figure out how anyone listened to these guys without first ingesting illegal substances, I give up.This is the most painful 79 minutes a human could endure without a waterboard...no one in the band can sing, the lyrics are awful, and it never occurs to anyone to play in the same key or time signature as anyone else. If five drunk chimpanzees formed a rock band, this would be the result.Punish your teenager by making them listen to this album while sober. Explain that they are hearing what drugs do to the brain."
2,Not a Deadhead,"Sorry I can't get into this or any other jam band for that matter. However, I did listen to this in its entirety a while back. The music meanders for a bit and then a few minutes into it Jerry Garcia decides to sing. It continues in this fashion for the rest of the album. This is signaled out as one of their best albums but still. The Dead were fans of Coltrane and admitted his influence (so did the Byrds but Eight Miles High is a classic song) but couldn't really absorb the aspects of jazz fusion in the way that say, Hendrix did. Basically you get a series of unfocused jams that wear you out. You kind of forget where the song goes and eventually the band remembers to return to the theme. The scary thing was how influential the Dead and this album were. If you're a deadhead, I doubt you will be swayed by this review but if you're not buy any 70's Miles album or Jimi Hendrix official concert albums and see that Live/Dead can't live up to its musical contemporaries."
1,Defective on Arrival,"I purhased this in November as a Christmas gift. We just discovered today (12/29) that the product is defective right out of the box. (Total distortion in the left channel)Having just read through Computer Brain's return policies, I am not sure what resolution I will have on this.Will update this entry when that is known."
4,Byrds with a twist,"The title of the cd says it all. This is where they came from , although the jugband roots are hardly present here."
1,sad!,"ordered this spider, never came in the mail...contacted seller and said one was on the way....never came."
2,Cheesy,"Expected more from this flick by reading reviews. Couldn't find a place to rent it so I bought it, I was beat out of 10 bucks. You won't miss a thing."
1,Not what I expected,"I was surprised. Surprised because I think I have seen that movie on late-night TV. I know, it's not the best review to hear, but if you see this movie you will believe it. I was expecting a movie that has a little more action; a movie that didn't look like it was made by a high school movie club. No, I'm afraid this movie is all that. I guess I can only expect this when I'm looking for the cheapest, interesting, movies."
2,Way too slow and cheesy,I just recently watched this film and found it very boring and extremely fake. The acting was basically non-existent and it seems that every bloke in this film is only out to get into the lead ladies pants. The only appealing feature of this film was the nude scenes.
4,"Great Shirt, Much Darker than Picture","The shirts feel well constructed, and I like the pen pocket. My only comment is the color was much darker than the picture. The item was called dark navy and I am perfectly happy with the shirt, just be aware the picture portrays a different color than the actual shirt."
4,Shirt,"We love these shirts! The only complaint that I have is that the green color is darker in reality, it almost looks black is some light."
3,Good Shirt But Sizing Problems,I usually wear a medium and am fine with the with of the shirt and the length but when I got this shirt it was huge pretty much a Large. If you are to buy this shirt then I would say to buy a size smaller than what you usually wear.The shirt itself though is good quality and comfy to wear.Would recommend this shirt for anyone.
4,Fun Time Travel Romp,"I really enjoyed The Watch, although to be honest, I do not read much science fiction, so don't have much in the genre to compare it with. On the flip side, I think that this book will have much appeal to non-sci fi fans. Peter Kropotkin, a Russian anarchist who died in the early 20th century is offered the chance, on his deathbed, to be reborn, as a 30ish man, in 1999. Kropotkin is a bright man and an utterly charming narrator. His story is interesting and engaging and fairly plausible. My only complaint is that the ending is not as strong as the rest of the novel, almost as if Danvers didn't really know quite how to end the novel. Still, this is an excellent, fun read."
3,Don't you love a time traveler story?,"This is an endearing tale of a Russian anarchist dying of old age in 1921 who gets a second chance at life in his rejuvenated body in 1999 in the United States. So two themes that are appealing--time travel and wisdom in a young body.The story is interesting and appealing. The building of a new life from scratch, learning all about modern life and history, developing new friendships--this is good stuff. The ending had some problems and seemed a little vague and dark compared to the rest of this upbeat story."
5,"Outstanding, a truly informative book","A Lifetime in the Eye of the Storm provides a rare and rich view of the Ngo Dinh family. Often maligned in the American press, which worked to bring down the government of South Viet Nam, the Ngo Dinh family worked to better their country and help out their fellow freedom loving citizens.It was quite touching that Ngo Dinh Diem cared greatly for the ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam that are being persecuted by the current communist dictators in Viet Nam.The book details the betrayal of Ngo Dinh Diem and his brothers by both the Americans and the corrupt Vietnamese who were interested in their own power and agenda.A great biography of an amazing family."
4,Very cute,"I thought the book was very well written with good characters and a strong emotional side to it. The main characters were funny and loveable but yet you could still sit there thinking, 'I could just deck that fool'. Overall the book was well written and very interesting."
5,H.O.T!,"This is one romance that comes so easily. Cat and Sam are two characters who matched perfectly. The book really entertaining and 5 hours just seemed like a blink while I read it, laughing, giggling, most of the time. And it is hot too, you know!"
5,enjoyable,"The story kept my interest throughout. It was funny and sensual. I thought the dialogue was ridiculous while they were getting out of the car that went off the road. Other that than, I loved it!"
2,Clever,A clever sequence of love story mingled with action to drive the budding romance. Good line of ever-present humor and plausible story lines.
4,I just bought more Susan Andersen and can't get enough. . .,This was great. At first I was a bit unsure the first chapter seemed to not grab my attention as quickly as I'd hoped but I plugged away and was definitely not disappointed. A perfect summer read and being in the last few weeks of pregnancy the romance and hot details are keeping me going. I just finished another Andersen book and am on my way to getting the rest.
5,I have never read Susan Anderson before....,I am truly hooked on this author. This book was GREAT. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. The twin story line was hysterical! I was wondering how long it was going to take for Sam to finally realize that he had the WRONG girl. I am on my way to the library to see if they have any more of her books. She reminds me a lot of Susan Elizabeth Phillips. The style is so similiar that I could swear that they are the same person. Do you think they at least know each other?
2,The missing piece,"As a previous reviewer pointed out, something WAS missing in this book and I think I found it. Integrity. The frustration you feel on behalf of the lead Kaylie is every woman's nightmare of feeling trapped and helpless in a situation you have no control over. She is accosted in her own home by the zealous bounty hunter Sam McKade, mistaken to be her twin sister, molested when she claims she is NOT the one, and then dragged across the country against her will. The fact that Sam is supposed to be a professional only makes Kaylie's plight worse in that he doesn't do anything conclusive to find out if she's really who she says she is. Read the blurb and take the book as you will. Some parts are entertaining but others are degrading."
1,Flat characters. Boring Story. Mediocre writing.,I'm not very demanding of my books. I just want a fun story with fun characters. This book failed to deliver either. The characters stuck to every stereotype. The actions and reactions were unbelievable. My first and last Susan Andersen book.
5,"Fast, Fun and Refreshing Read",This book is an easy to read contemporary romance that I found to be fast-paced. I especially enjoyed the great dialogue between the characters. The combination of the element of mystery going on in the plot along with the sexy by-play between the 2 main characters was fun and interesting. Susan Anderson is one of my favorite authors.
1,Awful!,"I thought this book was awful. It was tacky, and difficult to read. Only because I paid more for it than most romance novels, almost $7.00 - did I torture myself by forcing myself to read it. It did not get any better the farther I read. It was really stupid, and truly an awful book!"
1,Blech! Zero Star for this drivel,"Obviously everyone has a different opinion of this book, so I'm exercising my right to put my .02 cents in.This was obsolutely the worst romance novel I've ever read. I can not respect any man who's a cop wanna-be, sorry. He's obtuse (won't listen to heroine explain he's got the wrong girl), cheap, calls his best friend Gare (short for Gary). I mean what man would call Gary Gare (a woman might).We read romance novels to escape. I just wanted to escape from this hero. My skin was crawling by the time I finished this book.In fact, I am done with this author, I bought a whole bunch of her books because of all the glowing reviews, but I just can't take it anymore. This was her third book I read and I was not crazy about the first two, either, but this book does it for me. Fini."
1,"Silly plot, shallow characters, foul language is distracting","I kept reading this book against my better judgement. While it moved fast, I did not find the characters appealing or sensitive. In fact, they seemed cheap and certainly went well with the venues of the story. This book may appeal to those who like the tabloid talk shows, but to the readers who enjoy the gentile and refined characters of the more classy romances, this book is NOT for you."
4,"Reviewers bitter, beyond my grandest notions.","Apparently, All of the reviewers bashing this book and Chris Matthews in general are just bitter because he talks fast, or is more intelligent than they are. The fact is, if you watch him interview other people, or being interviewed himself, his knowledge of history is such that he put the toughest of guests on the spot, and frankly is one of the more intelligent guys on TV. I find him, and his book interesting for that very reason. Like few others I have ever watched, or read, he has endless anecdotal historical tidbits that are absolutely relevent to the discussion at hand, and lead to some thought provoking summations. So, with that said, I'd recommend the book."
1,Terrible,"Boring, trite, rushed. These talking heads just seem to churn out books for the payday, but there's no substance behind it. This book was awful. It was so bad I actually got angry. I feel ripped-off."
1,A big ego but nothing to say,"What could I expect from the host of a cable tv show who spends the bulk of his time shouting over his guests rather than engaging in any kind of meaningful dialogue. There's little of interest here: a re-warming of Matthew's rather tepid intellectual history of the American way. The Gore ""analysis"" is incredibly insipid and I have no love for Al Gore. Avoid this at all costs. It's a complete waste of time."
1,History for ...,"Matthews' book is for people who know absolutely NOTHING about American history. ... I consider this book a total waste of money!!He pulls books, movies, some extremely biased and simplified American ""history"", and certain American ""heroes"" from his own past and presents them as having been the KEY factors in forming what we consider to be the ""American psyche"".What amazed me is all that he left out -- the many historical events that truly shaped America. If Matthews has any in-depth knowledge of American history, he failed to reveal it here. Further, his simplification of the forming of the ""American psyche"" is laughable.Although 200+ pages in length, the book is an easy one-sitting read -- I read it all last night. Why? The pages are small in size and the print is large and widely spaced. It could have fit into a 50 page book of normal size and print.In short, don't waste your money."
2,"Skip the book, get the audio","I enjoyed hearing Matthews on the G. Gordon Liddy show discuss this book so much that I bought it. Well, I read Stephen Ambrose's final book just before this one and found Matthews' somewhat lacking. The two books are essentially the same in their goals, short essays on important highlights in American History. Some of the same topics are covered in both books. Ambrose just did a MUCH BETTER job. Ambrose was a skilled writer and Historian by trade, Matthews is a gifted gabber. So my suggestion is to listen to Matthews on Audio, but buy Ambrose's ""To America: Personal Reflections of An Historian""."
2,American History Lite,"This book is alot like light beer. It satisfies somewhat, but after consuming it, you wonder why. I like Chris Matthews, because I think he tries to be fair to both sides on his TV show. I read to learn new things, and regretfully I learned little from this book. This book tries to tie in history, famous figures, and movies. Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies. The other tenet in this book is the characteristics of Americans that make them different from the rest of the world. Again a long stretch. People are people, and Americans are no more unique than others in this world.I think highly of Chris Matthews and his first book Kennedy and Nixon. This just wasn't a great book. There are more deserving books out there."
1,American Civ for Dummies,"Chris MATTHEWS' latest ""book,"" once again, is small format, large type with wide margins, lots of blank pages, and pictures. 208 pages, 25 lines per page, 9 words to the line. He said on one of his snake-oil sales interviews that ""The word 'I' NEVER APPEARS."" It was a fantastic assertion coming from this ego-maniac---and---it's a lie. The infernal ""I"" is there from the Prologue and Chapter 1 on. The whole thing is a re-hash of selected cliches in American Civilization 101 courses out there. And, sublimating his 3-years' hit-job on Al GORE here, without the ""I"", his slant on President GORE in the 2000 Campaign was that this was the time for a Common Man and ""there wasn't one"" and that ""most people voted for him but they didn't want to hang out with him for four years."" At least this weak product isn't on the best seller list---yet."
1,A Self Righteous Blowhard,"Just because Bill O'Reilly wrote a successful book doesn't mean you can do it too and make sense.I had to stop reading this half way through because I am so tired of hearing him plug his book on his show EACH day.Mr. Mathews thinks he is so in touch with ""American"" values and gets so carried away in his ""theories"" that he drifts off into a fantasy world of self righteous American pride and loses his reader.If I want to read about American history I'll read David McCullough or Gore Vidal. Maybe even Pat Buchanan, but certainly not Chris Mathews. He should stick to his ""talking head"" shtick."
1,the spin STARTS here,More boring drivel from the man with the lowest rated program on cable news (even lower than Donahue!). Do yourself a favor and read something worthwhile.
1,Blow-hard blows hard,"Chris Matthews is beyond doubt the most annoying person on tv, and his writing style is identical to his huffy, overwrought tv style. This is a worthless book, written by someone who needs to be put out of his misery."
4,easily the best,"If you're deciding on which version to get, I definately recommend the LA cast. I understand Damian has a weak voice, but honestly, what do you expect. Do you think the bible version of Joseph was a teen pop star?!? What a joke! Some say Damian is too breathy, but, remember, it's not just a vocal performance. He was fitting into the character. I'd like to hear your voice after being locked up in a prison cell awaiting your death! If you're going on amazing lead singer, knock yourself out, get the Canadian version. Listen to that awful narrator til your ears bleed. If you're looking for the whole piece: good acting, good vocals from EVERYONE in the cast, and an enjoyable CD, get the LA cast."
4,Kelli Rabke and Donny Osmond!,"This CD is great because of Kelli Rabke. She is BY FAR the best Narrator on any ""Joseph"" recording. Michael Damian makes this recording weak. I seriously tend to skip his tracks. If you want to hear a GREAT Joseph, get the Candian version with Donny Osmond. He's amazing! It's too bad Osmond and Rabke couldn't be paired on a recording together. If you're looking for a good female voice to sing to, though - a good Narrator - look no further than this CD."
3,"Great, except for the Lead","This recording is excellent, except for one thing. ONE BIG THING. Michael Damien. Half the time you can't even hear him and the other half he just sings weakly. I don't want a cd where I have to be constantly be changing the volume or keep it up so I can hear the lead singer and then get a headache from the rest! It is still a great performance, and when you hear him, Damien's performance isn't bad... So I don't know if it's the recording or Damien, but I found this to be a big deterrant.I thought the narrator was amazing and really makes this a wonderful version. If you just get the cd for her, it's well worth it."
1,Do not buy this version!,"I bought this cd because it was the only one the store had under ""Joseph"", so I brought it home and listened to it. It was horrible! The Narrator's voice is way too high and shrill and you can't even hear the beauty of the music. All the songs are like that, the actor's voices are terrible. if you want the best version of Joseph, buy the 1982 original BW cast. Believe me, it's worth it. Don't waste your money like I did on this version, it's the only Broadway album I've ever had to give away. Bleh!"
2,GO FOR THE ORIGINAL CAST!!!!,Why did they have to ruin this show by making this recording? If you are considering buying it- DEFINATELY get original cast. They (for some reason) decided to put the show to a be-bop style and rap a few lyrics here and there. It doesn't suit this wonderful work of art. The female narrator made me want to throw a tennis ball in her mouth to make her shutup! The original male narrator is very good and they should have have never changed it for recent productions. The female is like fingernails on a chalkboard in my opinion. If you are an ALW fan- Joseph is a must for your cd collection but not this recording- skip it!!!!
4,I LOVE this show !!!,OK now i believe this IS one of webbers best musicals... But i do have to say i am not very pleased With this particular recording ..Having performed this show with the Broadway Touring company with Brian Lane Green i Believe his performance has FAR outdone Michael Damian's But if you are forced to buy this recording i say It is A MUST SEE SHOW!! The energy is INCREDIBLE and you can Never get sick of the music simply because of the variety!!!!!
3,Michael Damian,"Michael Damian is a very weak link in this ""Joseph"" cast. I listen to Joseph for several songs. Among them is ""A Land of My Own."" Damian's rendition is lifeless. He sings in tune, but there is no fervor in his voice. Everyone else in the cast is very good. For my money, the Donny Osmond cast album is better. That is just the opinion of one humble music teacher!"
3,Skip this recording and get the Canadian cast,"Having been in 3 productions of this musical and having seen countless others, I feel that there are interpretations of it that work splendidly and some that don't. This production is fabulous. Almost perfect, if a little over-blown in the spectacle department. The one weak link is Michael Damian. He doesn't really sing, he just sort of breathes on pitch. If you into this show for its portrayal of Joseph, get the Canadian cast with Donny Osmond--a suberb characterization. If on the other hand, you like the narrator's part, get this CD because Kelli Rabke can't be beat."
5,IT SO AWSOME,I acted in it. There are good vocals and has a very good beat. I LOVE THE SONG JACOB AND SONS. I LOVE THIS MUSICAL PERIOD!THIS STUFF RULES. GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!!!!
3,Speaker wire,This wire is just OKit's definitely just a regular zip cord wire but for speakers I would recomend the insulated color coded wire.
3,speaker zip,It works and serves its purpose. I don't really know how to rate this as I have not had an opportunity to compare it to other speaker wire.
5,Excellent as usual!,"Richard Maybury is a great author! With the companion volume World War I, Maybury will give you a new perspective on wars and history. Filled with facts of interest rarely mentioned elsewhere--P. T. Barnum's source for his sideshow foreigners, the advanced German spearpoint backed by horse drawn carts, the comparison of civilian murders by the Axis versus that of the Allies, the end of the war in the Pacific and the reason for the use of the atomic bomb, the remarkably successful Swiss policy, etc, etc.--""Uncle Eric"" writes succinctly and in a way to be understood. Highly, highly recommended!!"
5,Right on Target!,"Maybury does an excellent job of telling ""the rest of the story"". The evils of Joseph Stalin are detailed & U.S. propaganda campaigns are exposed. Every American should read this and ask why in the world our politicians have forever embroiled us in the internal affairs of warring Europe? The foreign policy approaches of George Washington & Thomas Jefferson will hopefully be reconsidered by learned individuals after reading this."
1,"oh no, another anti-government book","If you are a homeschooler with a deep mistrust of your government, then this is the book for you. I make that statement as a homeschooling mother, myself. The basic premise of the book may have a small amount of credibility,(yes, Stalin murdered lots of people, too.)But to make outrageous claims like, ""The Jewish Holocaust gets the publicity because it is regarded as the justification for Jews to have a Jewish State (Israel) in the Mideast."" (pg. 36), and, concerning Pearl Harbor, ""Few are willing to face the possibility that the President and his cronies planned it all."" (pg. 162), really show the author's bias.In short, if you are looking for a book with facts and the whys and wherefores of WWII--this ain't it! Look somewhere else."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This wine bottle opener is a real disappointment. I noticed it is no longer in stock here, but felt the need to warn people about this item. The bottle opener piece works in such a way that if you screw in the cork all the way (like you are suppose to with this particular model) it will punch through the bottom of the cork every time and you will get cork in your wine. The only thing good about it is that it lines the corkscrew up with the center of the cork, but that doesn't really matter when you are drinking or picking cork out every time. On the side of the corkpull there is a round little sharp piece to cut the top piece of the bottle to get to the cork. Nice idea, but it doesn't work. It's not sharp enough and there is no way to sharpen it. Plus it is too close to your hands when you pull on the handle that you might even cut yourself. Stick with the old fashion cork screw. Don't waste your money on this wannabe fancy one."
2,"worked for awhile, but...","I agree with the previous review about cork-punctures... happens all the time. Worse, however, is the fact that after a relatively short period of time, the inner workings of my particular model broke, leaving it useless. When it was still operational it worked well enough, but the fun didn't last long. As a result, though even Consumer Reports rated this item very good, I'd have to recommend against it."
1,fuentes,"i was unaware that this was an instructors edition and was very upset when i received it. i was not searching for an instructors edition, and no where in the text did it state the book as that..."
