4,Bad Girls of the Bible is Really Good,This was the first Christian fiction book I ever read and obviously the first of many Liz Curtis Higgs books I was destined to read later. It was fascinating to read the intro that Liz provided and how her life was so much different before she accepted Jesus Christ as her Savior. It was also interesting to learn so much about the women referenced in the bible because they are often overlooked. A fun way to learn more about the bible and what's in it.
3,Less Magical...,"This second recording reveals a rather sharp drop-off from the sublime Yachtless, which anyone who considers themselves a fan of pub rock should own. Only Suicide Jockey (which I believe had appeared in an earlier version) is a straight A tune, along with a couple of solid B's. And that was it - I can't even remember much of Tyla's solo efforts, though I've heard most of them."
4,Mellow Latin pop,"Chris Duran's self-titled album is an enjoyable collection of Latin pop. All the songs are sung in Spanish. Although there are some fast-tempo songs, the overall flavor of the album is mellow, with an emphasis on slow, sensuous horns in the musical accompaniment.Duran has a pleasant, soothing voice which he uses very effectively on the slower songs. He gives a sweetly playful performance on ""Mar de Dudas."" ""Baila, Baila , Baila"" has a disco flavor, and ""No me Dejas de Besar"" has a 50s rock-and-roll sound. If you like Latin pop, give ""Chris Duran"" a listen."
2,"Abysmal, amatuerish, and less exciting than counting sheep","It was with some embarrassment that I read The Dark Watcher and determined that anyone related to the famous can have a book published. Mr. Steinbeck is credited as a literature instructor, yet he uses the first and last name of his character in almost every paragraph, which I was told not to do in primary school. The names of Monterey area towns populate the story like a free map from the chamber of commerce. He should just throw his history notebook along with retold family stories away and try writing anew from his imagination."
1,A Terrible Waste,This book is everything that Dan Schneider at [...].htm has written. The world is full of wonderful books - this is not one of them.
4,Wonderful read,"I thoroughly enjoyed Thomas Steinbeck's storytelling. Vivid images, superb words, lots of nice surprises. I plan to read several of these stories to my 12 year old son -- who I know will also enjoy. Should be recommended high school reading."
3,ok,"this item was ok just as I expected I wish you didnt have to comment here on every thing, one two three four five six seven"
2,unnecessary,"Shallow, off-the-cuff reviews that relate plot and opinion and do little more. Gifford says he'd intended them to be ""impressionistic"" writeups, which is fine for his purposes but not very helpful for most others. In these entries Gifford offers little research or argument to support his views, instead tossing off praises or dismissals without bothering to justify them. The trouble is that this is a book, not a conversation at a coffeeshop, and so there's little chance of understanding why Gifford thinks the way he does. The result is a book that's more frustrating than illuminating."
1,Gifford is the worst,I just can't stand this guy. At least these books keep him away from his unreadable fiction or helping David Lynch foist more garbage on the silver screen.
5,Everything Is True,"Literary criticism has become so fickle, so arbitrary...it's turned into a game of grasping at straws. Whoever ""locates"" the most ""profound"" meaning or symbol within a novel wins. I read reviews and papers these days and find I agree with almost nothing anyone has to say. It's a big game.That said, this is the one book I've read that is big enough (figuratively) to contain any idea or notion I could see someone projecting onto it. In his relatively simple story, Nabokov somehow managed to create a wealth of ideology and symbolism. As anyone will tell you, the guy was an absolute master of language, and his talent allows him to explore the meanings and motives of human intelligence and heart. This is a complex, beautiful, heartbreaking work. In a word: transcendant."
5,At the Top of My List,"The most absolutely beautifully written novel of the 20th century. It will make you question your own morals and values. A novel that can make you do this is truly great. The language and imagery used within is incredible. It's hard to believe that English is not Nabokov's first language. If you have some background in literature, you will enjoy his subtle references to E.A. Poe, etc. This is the only book to ever make me cry. I read the ending 4 times; I didn't want it to end."
4,"excellent literature, but a revolting topic","The topic of child molestation is revolting. That said, the book is excellent. To me it is a novel of the conflict between love and evil. Humbert loves his nymphet, but his love is too strong and selfish and so evil triumphs. His evil steals her childhood. The author walks the fine line between the subject matter and his art well. I could actually laugh from time to time at humbert and his situation."
4,Good condition,"i'm stoked to read the book and the condition is nice. i did not receive the book in the display, however. it had a different cover. but that's all really fine because i don't really care, i'm just glad i received the book and in adequate time. pleased."
5,Nabokov is my rock star idol,"One of the best questions to ask a writer is, ""If you could wish to have written any book, which one would it be?"" For me, it's Lolita. Good God. I started crying on the first page. Right about here: ""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns."" This is definitely a novel for those who don't appreciate the literary acrobatics of Ada or Pale Fire. There are few brainy gimmicks, and the genius is in the breathtaking prose."
2,Really disgusting!,Of course this is considered great literature. But I couldn't get past the appalling story. How can the rape and ruin of a twelve year old be palatable enough to ignore?
2,"Except for defective production on discs 4,7& 10, it was wonderful.","Jeremy Irons ""owns"" this beautiful written, sad, lushly poetic tale. But, enjoyment is marred by the inaudible, incoherent or missing segments on four of the ten discs! The ending, disc 10, is completely ruined. Amazon, I hope, will make good on this purchase through refund or exchange."
1,A tale of two parts,"This book is a tragedy; not in the standard literary sense, but in a comparison of Part One and Part Two. Part One has an urgency and emotion to it rarely encountered in fiction. Part Two is a dull romp across the country, with blood and irrational action dominating the final pages.In Nabokov's notes at the end of the novel, he writes that publishers thought Part Two was too long. They were right. He should have published just Part One as a novella, and left the magic stand alone."
2,Don't bother,I have to disagree with the other reviews posted. I only finished half of this book before deciding to quit entirely. I wasn't thrilled reading about an older man coveting a young girl so much he was willing to do anything to have her. There's enough strange things in this world and reading a book about one wasn't enjoyment.
3,"Aroused, but not satisfied","Why do I give this only three stars? It's a work of genius, right?For my taste, Vlad is simply too vain. I don't like a man who is always congratulating himself on his technique."
3,Weird,"Weird, just weird. I had no idea what this book was about until my Aesthetic Philosophy class went over it in class. Truly disturbing.BUT I must say that the use of language and words in this book are phenominal!"
3,This book was unlike any I've ever read (or will read again),"I can't help but add my two cents to what other reviewers before me have said. This book left me speechless. I was absolutely dazzled by the prose. It was stunningly beautiful and graphic. (I am especially amazed that the prose is still this good after translation from the original Russian). I don't think I've ever read more creative writing. But the bottom line for me was this- Humbert Humbert is a pedophile- and even though the book wasn't graphic in it's detail, the insinuation was plenty clear. I had a hard time getting beyond this fact- great writing or not. What kind of person was Nabokov to have written this with such perfection? It's not classic erotica- it's simply perversion when you come right down to it. Beautifully written aberrance."
3,"Sad,Sad,Sad","Lolita is one of the saddest books i've ever read.It gives you the point of view of a self pityng self justifying self centered paedophile, who ruins every human being he meets.Blas√®, presumptuous and oblivious of any feelings and needs other than his own, Humbert Humbert exploits the naive love of the poor Charlotte to gain proximity to her hapless daughter,Lolita. Humbert's a monster of possessivism, at his most revolting when, having told poor Lolita that her mother is dead, he gloats over the fact that she had no-one else to rely on than him. Eventually she escapes, but not to better life,sadly. Good grief,what depressing story, and this monster Humbert is one of the most hateful sad bastards of literature. Erotic? This book can make an ascete out of you."
5,Only Nabokov could pull this off,Only a great writer could make one sympathize/empathize with a pedophile. As creepy as that sounds - it is fiction however - and Nabokov's style pulls you into the story and makes it all feel immediate and imperative.I was just sorry that I saw the film (years ago) as I still can't get James Mason out of my mind as the protagonist and he was too short for the part - and Shelly Winters was (in my opinion) mis-cast as well and Lolita (Sue Lyon) was TOO OLD - and not particularly good.The book - is faboulous - its Nabokov!
2,Overrated,"Maybe it is because I have daughters myself, but I just found this book uncomfortable to read. Is it different? Yes. Intelligently written? Yes. Would I ever read it again? No. Although there were moments when I found myself smiling at the humour, generally I just found it creepy and very dull. It may be one of those books which you should read in your lifetime.... but I will not be picking it up again!"
4,Lolita,"Book arrived a little later than I anticipated. But it did arrive in the condition promised. Overall, it was a good buying experience. I would purchase from here again. Thank you!"
3,lolita,I did not get the version of the book that i thought i bought. So if you need a specific version buy it somewhere else.
3,Lolita Review,"I didn't find myself particularly loving or hating the book. There were some scenarios that definitely caught me off guard, and it is definitely beneficial to read something that will do that for you, but overall, I feel the book was interesting enough to keep my interested for the time being, but I probably won't pick it up again.-Stephanie"
2,"Things I Liked, Things I Didn't Like","Things I Liked:-Funny sex euphemisms-Narrator's name, although pseudonymous, was ""Humbert Humbert""-Humbert's pedophilia wasn't limited to Lolita, and he was very passionate about itThings I Didn't Like:-The narrator was intelligent, which resulted in a verbosity that became extremely tiresome by the end of the novel. Feel like Saul Bellow has narrators like this too... thinking specifically of ""Humboldt's Gift,"" which, in my opinion, was unreadable"
4,Egadz - it's 10 disks,"This is a review of the DVD only, not the book.The set is 10 disks, packed in 2 cardboard fold-up holders that sit in a thin plastic pocket in the inch-thick exterior box. Not exactly ""compact"".Nothing can replace reading the book, as some of it has intentional puns and homonyms, etc, that do not come across as well when heard as they do when read. Also, Irons does a good job, but some of his Britishisms sound odd to an American ear - such as ""MAR-kwiss"" for ""m-a-r-q-u-i-s"", and ""drar"" for ""d-r-a-w"", etc. And, his voice and tone for Lo and Quilty and others is not what I have imagined for them.If you like to read then I would recommend either version of the book (""plain"", or ""annotated"" with 150 pages of notes) over this audio version. If you hate to read, or perhaps have a lot of time on the road, then this CD of ""Lo"" makes the perfect little travelling companion."
3,What's all the hype about this?,"This is a good book, but I don't see where it's profound. There's a difference between well written description of deviancy, beauty and obssession that applies to one strange guy, opposed to saying something subtle. I see here a surface treatment of things with flowery and manic language. I don't know why the Modern Library calls it the 4th best book of the 20th century. Heart is a Lonely Hunter, for example, is much more profound.If you know why ""Lolita"" is so great, send me email, I'd like to hear it"
3,The difference between love and exploitation,"You get inside the mind of a lonely and sensitive person.The beginning is a little boring, I find much more intriguing the end,when we discover that the protagonist is not as evilish as it appears throughout the novel.In fact he himself realizes the difference between his love for an ideal girl and the people who had really exploited her."
5,A classic work of contemporary American fiction.,"The term ""tragicomedy"" is often misapplied, but in the caseof _Lolita_, it is the only fitting term. Although thenarrator, a European struggling with American traditions,is dark, driven, and suffering from a tragic obsession, hecan also be unintentionally quite funny as he describesthe people around him with relentless animosity. Nabokovof course leaves us to wonder whether he is as attractiveto all women as he claims to be, but there is a sensitivityin the portrait that gives a man who would otherwise bedisgusting an added dimension, and which ultimately makesthe reader sorry for him rather than judgemental. This bookremains timely despite, or perhaps because of, its longhistory of criticism, beginning with a publisher who said,""I think it should be buried under a rock for a thousandyears."""
5,Much more powerful than even its controversial reputation would indicate,"Wow. Beautiful, witty, clever, perfect. A masterpiece (or ""un chef d'oeuvre"" as Humbert would undoubtedly say). Any book that makes me laugh and cry with my whole belly, face, and heart repeatedly throughout the book (though most of the crying came at the end) and within the same ten minutes has accomplished an amazing feat. I found this on the shelf of our family library, and when my mother tried to discourage me, her not-really-that-innocent seventeen-year-old daughter from reading it, I knew it must be good. Of course it's disturbing, but people who dwell on it excessively are missing out on quite an experience. It's one of those books that must be read again and again because there are so many allusions, puns, etc. that are easy to miss the first time. Next time I'll be reading an annotated version, but I enjoyed trying to pick up on everything myself the first time around. I recommend doing the same thing."
5,American Idyll,"Lolita, and Nabokov's writing in general, is in a word brilliant. The reader must be quite well read and culturally astute to understand many of the nuances of this novel (unless you get the annotated one, but I found it more fun to see what I would understand on my own, followed by looking up which I didn't). I stared in wonder when my fencing instructor asked, horrified, ""Why are you reading THAT TRASH?"" I asked if he'd ever read it. The response came, ""No, I don't read filth."" Lolita is not filth, in any way shape of form. Filth is purient. It is hard for me to imagine Nabokov as a Russian. He captures the American landscape so idyllicly; his description of the advertisements, magazines, music, and the people are wonderful. Nabokov captures what many have been trying to cage for years: the subtlty of emotion which can only be found in obsession."
5,"My Favorite, Yes, _FAVORITE_ Novel Of All Time","I read _Lolita_ for the first time when I was the same age as Lolita herself and being a girl too, I identified with the story Nabokov told in a way that frightened me in a wonderful way. Never before and never since has a novel pervaded me so completely and showed me another way of looking at myself and the world. Those who rate this novel as ""over-hyped"" and ""disgustingly lascivious"" have not truly entered the world of Nabakov that is so well known to his loyal readers. Once you finish _Lolita_, read _Ada_ and then start your way down the lengthy list of other novels he's written. You won't be disappointed - Nabakov makes the reader taste the words and live between the pages."
3,Lolita,Humbert Humbert needed to keep his inappropriate relationship with Lolita secret but he soon became supremely obsessive and controlling over her. He ranted on and on and his dialogue became confusing to me. I guess his madness was so complete that I couldn't keep up and I feel like I missed out on a lot of what really happened.
5,Different than you expect,"There were many incorrect preconceived notions I had about this novel, that were dispelled once I read it. The book is centered around a startling contradiction: A monster that worships purity. The book unfolds around this theme with some of the most beautiful prose you will ever read."
5,A New Perspective,"Lolita is a truly riveting love story. But aside from the taboo romance, depth of the characters, and the color of the landscapes, I found this book intriguing for its perspective.The description that Nobokov gives of each and every American scene is truly dazzling. Despite the fact that he was born in Russia and spent much of his time around Europe, Nobokov managed to create a classic American novel. Lolita has done as much, for me at least, to bolster the ever elusive American romanticism as Twain, Fitzgerald, or Kerouac."
1,Sick,"I read this book at the beckoning of an English professor who described as one of the greatest love stories ever written. I was horrified when I realized that this book is about a pedophile that takes advantage of a little girl. How anyone could describe the happenings of this book as love is beyond me, and I hope it stays that it stays beyond me. I continued reading the book in search of any inkling of non-perverted ""love"" and I found none."
1,child pornography masquerading as art,"It is a fitting testament to our times that this novel, which should never have been published in the first place, has come to be regarded not only as a modern classic, but as the finest novel of the last century. Only a thoroughly immoral man could have written it and only a thoroughly immoral age would celebrate it. The review cited on the cover - describing it as the ""only convincing love story"" of the century - is the perfect punch line to this absurd joke: what better way to demonstrate your unimpeachable sophistication than by characterizing an explicit account of pedophelia as a love story? If you want to read erotic descriptions of children and sickeningly-detailed depictions of child molesting, the law is apparently powerless (or at least unwilling) to stop you, but please, please, don't hide behind ""art."" Admit, at least to yourself, what you're really doing; admit what you are."
1,Blah,"I thought I would like this book after reading the reviews, but I tried to start it and it went NOWHERE! Plus, it was really hard to read. And boring. Ugh. I don't recommend this book."
2,Don't get it,"Why the hype, they say it's a classic a must read, I don't see it! The guy is sick in the head and basically kidnaps, blackmails. brian washes and has sex with an 12 yr old"
2,"Too much hype, too little substance!","Other than the controversial subject matter, I do not understand the hype surrounding the work and did not find this ""novel"" to be extraordinary. The story promised an interesting reading at the outset, but turned into a soporific mind-numbing experience shortly after Humbert and Lolita embark on their road trip.I must vehemently protest the #2 slot Lolita occupies on the Modern Library's list."
2,Misogyny lives in Nabokov's Lolita,"Interestingly, the reviewers who boast that Lolita is ""The best novel I have ever read,"" are all male. Lolita is not about love--pedophilia never is and Lolita is 12 years old. As a professor of English and as a feminist (and the mother of a young girl), I have never been able to ignore the troubling content nor the blatent misogyny in this text to appreciate Nabokov's clever narrative structure. If men think this is a love story, then, goddess help us all."
4,Worth the discomfort you'll feel,"A disturbing, but eloquently told tale of Humbert Humbert's fascination with nymphets, and his incestuous relationship with the young Dolores Haze, or Lolita."
5,Most probably the best English language novel ever written.,Nabakov is a sorcerer with the English language more than any native speaker of English that I have ever read.The story of self-deception as well as the critique of America vanity and excess.I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what Great writing is.
5,"An rainbow of colorful, dancing sun-flecked jewels","Nabokov said an author's primary purpose is to ""enchant"" the reader and ""Lolita"" is an arrow fired from Neptune which nets a New Hampshire bullseye. Nabokov's gift to the enraptured reader is not merely the poignancy of hopeless, perverse romance, but of Humbert's melancholy genius for expression, nuance and passion: Twelve year-old Dolores Haze is defiled by a pathetic beast in every carnal region of America; Humbert doesn't just cry, he weeps ""lovers tears, hot, thick opalescent;&quot Psychoanalize ""Lolita"" to death if you must; I prefer allowing the rhapsodic, untrammeled prose of Humbert's observations to ENCHANT me. Most immemorial works are tragic, many are hilarious, all are love stories of some kind. These are but a few of ""Lolita's"" traits, only a shimmering sample--as is realized when one has finished the book and returned to terra fimra after an indescribable, utterly magic ride. I love ""Lolita."""
4,Strange but interesting,"I bought this book solely due to its reputation, having no opinion or previous experience with the writer. It is a book that I am glad I read but it is unusual due to subject matter. His writing style is also a little strange, it is written as if the character is writing the book himself and he sometimes refers to himself in the third party. Quite humerously at times. A working knowledge of French (which i do not have) would have helped the book flow a little better but it was not essential. The second half was a bit slow and did not grab my attention as much as the first half. Worth reading"
4,"Controversial theme, but highly intriguing","Enjoyed the book. The reader is introduced to the mind of Humbert who is encaptivated by Lolita, and quickly follows in swift pursuit of encompassing his world around her. What is personal taste and preference of one's attractions? Through Humbert's quiet musings and harmless justifications of his behavior, one is strangely accepting of the middle-aged man's inclination to young ""nymphets"". The cover has a soft elegance to it - I love having this book as one of my possessions."
5,An astonishing reading by Jeremy Irons!,"One of the best audiobooks I have ever heard(and I've heard a lot). Jeremy Irons' reading is captivating, electrifying, and thoroughly nuanced.Do not miss this performance!"
5,....,"Lolita gives off the feel of the most lovingly crafted book ever written, and the subject matter to which it serves creates a great irony, the author's passion for the English language is spilled over every perfectly crafted phrase and character...About as thrilling a read as one can get."
4,For Kindle Readers Only - EDITED REVIEW,"After having contacted customer sevice and been told the book would be fixed in a few days, I reordered it. It was not fixed. Apparently it was decided by TPTB at Random House that the horrible formatting was actually intentional, which astounds me, but whatever. I bought and returned this book twice. I've given up.Read the book, do, but maybe you'd be better off with an edition other than Kindle.*********************************************************************The books is great, but you should be aware that there is no indentation or spacing whatsoever between the paragraphs, making the kindle edition of this book difficult to read. I bought and returned my copy today and notified Amazon.Again, this is not about the book itself, just the formatting. Admittedly, I probably should have checked the sample, but honestly, it never dawned on me as the book is an $11.99 Big Six classic novel. I'll know better in future."
2,"overwritten, overrated","Writing? This is the kind of language used by an obnoxious, self-loveing bore at a dinner party. Overwritten, overrated, the very definition of 'pretentious'."
3,Great literary pyrotechnics--but not much else,"Lolita earns its reputation as an example of masterly literary prose. However, after reading this book, I had the same feeling I have had after seeing an impressive high-wire circus act: one glides quickly from the excitement of ""Wow"" to the emptiness of ""Is that it?"" Nabokov seems so thrilled with the act of writing, whether it be on the level of rhythm, word choice, or theme, that it seems to me more of a display of writing than an act of communication. One can find stylistic mastery with substance and emotional truth in writers like E.B. White or Thorton Wilder and a score of other authors that leave you feeling haunted as though you've been enlightened about life. Lolita leaves one enlightened about Nabokov."
3,Indulge yourself with Lolita...,"Lo. Lee. Ta. An intriguing novel to say the least. A book you're apt to enjoy and yet almost feel guilty for said enjoyment at the same time.Protagonist Humbert Humbert takes us on a wanton proverbial journey through his past, middle, and present. The book begins with Humbert coveting his precious nymphet, Lolita; Light of his life, fire of his loins Lolita. Beautific perfection in the form of a lascivious twelve year old girl. Soon the reader is enmeshed in a world wrought with innuendos of lechery and craze.Nabokov spins his perverse web with articulate precision and unyielding aplomb with no short of brilliance.Swimming review? Yes. Would I put it on my top 100 Greatest Novels of All Time list? No. Nevertheless the book did indulge me and from hitherto I had not a taste of Nabakov's delicious gift for words, thus he is now a highly esteemed author by yours truly. =)"
3,"Lucidly insane, yet crazily calm","That's an apropos oxymoron taken from Humbert Humbert that best describes this paradox of a novel. Lolita's premise proves to be that of insane & perverse debauchery, yet nonetheless the prose which so aptly packages it demonstrates such skill in a crazily calm manner. Nabokov unequivocally substantiates his high praise as well-deserved with his rich use of symbolism, imagery, and his extensive use of the French language - all of which I enjoyed and appreciated. Having said that, I became somewhat disenchanted with the redundant subject matter of Humbert incessantly obsessing with 12 year-old Lolita throughout the entire novel with little character development of Lolita whatsoever. To say the non-stop use of the words ""nymphet"" and ""pubescent"" on every single page became trite and exceedingly annoying would be to put it lightly. A good book with dry humor that's worth a read, but not one of the top 5 classics of all-time as mandated by the Modern Library."
4,Well written but very disturbing,"I don't share the views of many of the reviewers that this is a love story. I couldn't find any redeeming qualities in the main character Humbert Humbert. On the surface masquerades as a misguided intellectual who's fallen in love with a young girl, but underneath he embodies the malicious, cold-blooded, calculating evil that lurks in mankind. I admire Nabokov for his exquisite, painterly writing style, but make no mistake it is a very dark and disturbing book. The physical rape of Lolita pales in comparison to the systematic psychological rape that Hubert inflicts on her through out this story."
3,What's the point?,"Nabokov explicitly points out that this book wasn't written to shock; what's left is a boring story where little happens. The characterization of the protagonist is very well done, however. Not worth the hype."
3,Crazy!!!!!,"It is crazy!!! The people always admire this book, but after I read it I'm disappointed. I can't see anything except a strange, crazy story. I think a good book should have something to tell, not only the one between the covers. I want to ask, "" what you guys learn after reading it?"" But I do confess that the languages is brillant."
4,Peeling the Onion of Humanity,"First of all the topic and concept are utterly wretched. A pervert praying on female children, spending an extraordinary amount of energy trying to squeeze empathy from the readers. As if that wasn't ugly enough the story conclude by murdering the person that saved the poor child. But in spite of all that, I still enjoyed reading the book and basking in the naked perversion. Being a male in a victorian society, one looks for outlets, even imaginative ones, and it's difficult to get outraged about your own lurid nature, a nature put there by God. To love is our nature. This book appeals to the base humanity and the lowly creature stirring within. It was brave material for its day and maintains a universal but savage appeal."
5,Unparalleled,"In a word - WOW. Mind-bending. Beyond belief. You must read it to believe it is possible to write a perfect book (with regard to writing, not to subject matter!). A non-native English speaker, no less! I will not soon recover."
5,A modern reality of how love can be blind and innocent.,"Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita is a seductive, loss of innocence, love story. Best portrayed by a mad man's desire and obsession of a fourteen year old child. Humbert understands his love for Dolores is forbidden, but his ever lasting infatuation blinds him from what is wrong with a relationship with an adulescent. Dolores is a promiscuous, self-absorbed little girl, the fire of Humbert's Loins. I would recommend this book to adults, who are willing to feel sorry for Humbert."
5,Perfect,"This is the best book I have ever read.That said, I almost don't even know how to begin writing a review of it. Let's see about the main points, at least:This book is equally horrific and hilarious. Vladimir Nabokov's control and command of English (not his first language) is better than mine will ever be. While never explicit, the ""relationship"" scenes between Humbert and Lolita are erotic enough that I felt uncomfortable reading them.This is the kind of book that I can't even fully appreciate after reading just once. I've added The Annotated Lolita to my To Read list, and I bet I'll read it within a few months. After that I will post a more detailed review.I can't wait to read it again."
5,Jeremy Irons...What a treasure!,This is my third reading of Lolita... the audiotape version. It is one of my most favorite books of all time... now narrated by Jeremy Irons. Jeremy Irons' beautifully nuanced voice is like reading Lolita for the first time. What a treasure!
3,Not for me,Somehow I spent years as an English major avoiding this novel. I found it to be very slow going. Not my type of humor (very dry!)
3,Overall a good book but alittle too descriptive...,"The author is definently a wonderful writer and poet - but what was going through his head when he thought up the plot for this story?? At parts, it is alittle too uncomfortable to read! The idea of a 50 year old man in love with a 12 year old is obviously not accepted in our society nor was it accepted when Nabokov wrote this book. But, it does open the reader to a new horizon of literary variety and so I recommend this novel to anyone interested, yet I do agree that it is controversial!"
4,read it with a dictionary!,"i had a love hate relationship with this book. i devoured the first 2/3 of it, then the last part would *not end* i was very dissapointed about the direction the story took towards the ending, it just seemed so silly. however, i picked it up again a year later when i was trying to build my vocabulary. if nothing else, read it for the great words you can extract from it, and impress your friends!"
1,The most overrated book of al time,"This and Catch 22 are the most overrated books of all time. This book is dated. The second half of the book is boring. The writing is cumbersome and pedantic. Most of all, the people who love this book - 18 year old freshmen - seem to love it because they are told to love it.Other thoughts - so the guy f--cks an underaged girl. Big deal. The guy likes underaged girls - big deal (that's why we have SORA i.e. Megan's Law). Maybe this was a big deal in the 60's but now its old news.PS - The only thing I ever liked about this story was the movie (the first one in black and white) - in particular the one scene where the girl is drinking a soda and using her toung to reach into her bag of potatoe chips. Goddamn erotic."
2,-,"Not too bad, but I think it's placee on he greatest of the english language list is a bit stretched. Nabokov has an excellent command of the language, which in itself makes the book worth reading. But the story itself didn't live up to the hype. I just didn't care what happened, and this came dangerously close to being one of those books one just never finishes because of a lack of caring."
5,Lolita,I read the erotic parts of this book in high school. Reading this book now was quite disturbing. The perspective of having a teenage daughter and working in social work made the book seem quite different. The book is extremely well written and I highly recommend it.I think that our society views pedophilia differently now that when the book was written.
1,Lolita,"Lolita was not only a slow book to read, but it is completely about pedophilia and how a man get's to have his way with his ward."
2,Heartbreaking disappointment,"I read the summary and I read the reviews and thought this book would be fabulous. The perfect book for my vacation; an adult story line to keep you interested and an arousing theme to keep you entertained on the beach. Well I was wrong! The author strings you along through the first quarter of the book with his dreaming of this young girl, finally gets her and doesn't tell you about it! Instead, he drowns on about the sites they saw across the US! What a bore! I've got half way through this book and have absolutely no desire to continue reading it! I was so looking forward to enjoying this novel. What a disappointment!"
4,Disgustingly wonderful!,"Humbert Humbert is a disgusting and selfish individual who betrays all sense of decency for himself, driving his own wife to his death, and forever sentencing his adopted daughter to a life of misery. But there's a little bit of Humbert Humbert in all of us, and that's the scary part. With his soul searching and long drawn out monologues we feel many of the same feelings that he feels. This is not a book about pedophilia, it's a book about selfishness. And it serves for all of us as a moral lesson about what we should not let ourselves become."
5,Literary Beauty,"If you read Lolita looking for smut or porn, go elsewhere. This was beautifully written and focused on the main character, H.H., as he tried to justify his crimes and place blame on Lolita, who was merely a girl with a crush who, by the end, became the victim. Nabokov writes exquisitely, and there is no gratuitous sex scenes. The only scenes where sex is even mentioned is where it is essential to the plot.Lolita is a gorgeous story, and I recommend it to more mature readers who aren't narrow minded. Keep in mind that it's literature, not vulgarity, and also remember that it was written as a comedy, which by no means excuses the main character's perverted actions but makes it much easier to take. Lolita is for people who are willing to think while they read!I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!"
5,Funny and moving . . .,"Despite his many flaws, you just have to love Humbert Humbert. I found myself reading this book after I had seen the movie and, as has been the case many times before, was able to understand the book better because of this. I found that little Lo was a delightfully belligerent, intelligent, cocky, and sad girl. Humbert was naturally a selfish jerk, but that was his character. Nabokov did an excellent job with this novel. It offers many insights into the human mind and is not even graphic or vulgar. What a good read!"
5,One of my favorite books,"I've read this book in Russian. It's superb. Nabokov's language can't be compared with anyone's else. It's unique. It's so rich, so luxuriant.Most of all I was impressed how Humbert Humbert describes his love to Lolita. When I read these passages I believe that love exists. It's exactly the way I imagine real love.Somebody will consider Humbert's feelings a bit [pervese]. Still they are sincere.His tragedy is that his love is not mutual. The novel itself is brilliant."
4,Lolita (Vintage International),"I know for many people the topic of pedophilia is uncomfortable. If you can get past that, then you can explore the use of the English Language and how he plays with it. I loved the wordplay used by Nabakov. I found it fascinating that an adult can live in such a fantasy world and not go crazy."
4,Good Novel but Disturbing,"Lolita is definitely a great novel in terms of the believability of it's characters. They come across so realistically, and the writing style itself is quite fascinating, I felt, while I was reading this novel, that the prose seemed to become more erratic the more passionate the protagonist became for Lolita. It was this aspect of the novel alone which captivated me, because I was found the idea of Lolita's love affair to be repellant. I was disturbed by the relationship between Lolita and her lover. So, although I can recognize why Lolita is listed as one of the greatest novels of the age, I would caution people who are thinking about picking it up. I found reading the novel to be a wholly uncomfortable experience, but it's a good read if you can get past the social taboos that the novel isn't afraid to explore."
4,Nabokov is an excellent author!,"I read this book as an assignment for a Comparative Literature course, and it was absolutely wonderful. I was enthralled by the authors writing style! Nabakov writes so well, that you do not want to ever stop reading it! This book tells a love story, but it is not the traditional tale that you would expect to find in a love story. It is very interesting to see such a twist on the love story. This is one book that you definitely must read."
3,Lolita,"Lolita was a very interesting book, ahead of its time in terms of the amount of explicit themes and content. Although in some ways it could be be viewed as a perverted love story. Overall interesting book and insight to the primal mind of man in some ways."
4,Beautifully Written,"I've been wanting to read this for a while, and when I finally did, I definitely wasn't disappointed. Nabokov's language in this novel is incredible -- the way he portrays the psyche of ""nymphet""-seeking Humbert Humbert is entirely unique. At times, the book can become a little boring, mainly around halfway through. Also, the frequent use of French in the text can become a little irritating but inevitably adds to the originality of the novel. If you're looking for an interesting challenge, Lolita is the perfect match."
1,To The Remainder Table!,"I'm fascinated with the phenomenon of celebrity and how we turn these people into figures of worship so, naturally, I was curious about this book. First of all, there are some pretty interesting books out there about ""heroes"" classical and contemporary -- this isn't one of them. I think the fact the creators used Uri Geller to try and lend authority to this mess of a book (almost as impressive as if they'd gotten Sally Struthers to hawk the book) says quite a lot! The photos are as interesting as anything you might find in a newspaper or mainstream mag (i.e., not especially inspired or aesthetically/technically sophisticated). The writing that accompanies the photos is sophomoric. Ergo, anybody can get a book published if it's got celebrities in it. Save your money for a good book of photography... Mary Ellen Mark, Avedon, etc. Otherwise just go buy a USA today... you'll find the same PR style pap and conventional photography."
5,Mine came with a reservoir,"Fought my brake problem for a long time. Finally bit the bullet and ordered this. Bought 2 of the dorman kits to get the 2 plugs required to bleed it. Bench bled it (15 min). Installed it (1 hr, mostly because of weird wrench angles). Jumped in an gave it a test run. Works great. I didnt even need to bleed the lines. Finally safe again."
2,Faux Fur Throw,"Not pleased with this purchase. It looks nice in the pic, but upon arrival it was stiff and shedding. I returned it straight away. If your looking for an excellent leopard throw check out Pottery Barn. Theirs is lovely, durable and easily washed. (hang dry only)"
2,Water Treatment System,"The delivery on this product took way to long, and after calling to get the tracking #, I was given the run around. Also, I bought one from Costco in the past and they provide 2 pitchers, Amazon only provided one and the price went up over 30%."
2,Think carefully,"I was very excited when I saw this product on HGTV's ""I Want That!"". Who would not want better tasting super pure water? I ordered the unit and it arrived no problem. The unit itself is quite large and dwarfed everything else in my kitchen. Water processing easily and is very clean tasting. However the water made my tongue tingle and I developed a headache and a rash on my chest the very next day! As soon as I went back to my Brita I was fine.This product could be great if you are looking to leave the expense and waste of bottle water behind. However, use the product as soon as you get it. If you have any problems do not hesitate to return it pronto. You'll either love it or hate it."
1,"Must be aware, gel-like particles suspended in the treated water","Here is the test you should try (for anyone who have this unit): process a cup of tap water. It appears to be very clean after the processing. Now heat the ""clean"" water (e.g. using conventional microwave or kettle) and look into the cup, stunning large particles of gel-like flakes will appear in the cup (very obvious!). This happened to me on two separate units every time, I have tried to clean every part and pre-conditioned system more than ten times and the suspension substance just kept coming!Secondly, the processing carafe is very easy to get dirty (in two weeks you will see stain marks on the inside of the carafe considering it processes tap water) but very difficult to clean(try to find a next-to-impossible-to-find special screw driver to open the base of the unit).Not recommended to anyone who have young kids!"
4,conspiracy,"there seems to be groups of the same people posting bad reviews amazon about random products. i can see trends in their writing styles i.e. diction, manner, etc. the opposite can be said for ""some"" good reviews."
1,Beware of this product as the reviews are false,Before you buy based on the reviews click on the reviewers and you can see they have only reviewed other products made by this company.The language is similar in all the reviews. Abuse of the review system is terrible and I hope the company suffers for it.
2,Consumer Reports number one recommended......,Decided to buy based on consumer reports recommendation. This was just a couple months ago and they recommended it. They didn't say NOT to buy it. My question (and the reason I'm leaving a low rating) is: Why spend nearly $400 on a system you can get anywhere else for $220?
2,"no thank you, too much checking","I decided after reading the instructions for use, this product was just not for my busy working life. I did not remove it from the box and asked to return it.What a disappointing surprise to learn that the company charges a $15 restock fee! Had I known before purchasing, I would not have.I am stuck with this product & will try to sell it privately.Check the seller's return rules BEFORE purchasing!"
1,Crap,"I seem to have gotten the last one of these. Lucky me. The fool thing did 3 cycles and stopped pumping water into the pitcher. It did, however, manage to dump lots of water on the table and floor due to a leak in the filter enclosure. The thing was sent in a box that was sized for two units. There was no packing material in the extra large outer box. So, I'm sure the inner box had a merry journey of its own on the trip from the seller. I've asked for a refund. Let's see if I get one."
1,Needs to be replaced too soon,"We have had the LSR100 for a year and it worked great. Then just as the one year warranty expired, to our surprise the system stopped working. And for the past three months the customer service has been telling us to wait for a technician to call. And you wait and wait for nothing. Tersano built a product that needs to be replaced annually and for the price of the unit, it is not worth it. I read some recent reports and they had similar complaints with customer service (or should I say no customer service)"
3,I love it but...,"My Mom is the gadget lover in our family. She bought three of these, one for herself, one for me and one for my sister. Mine clunked out after a year and a half. My Sister gave me hers because her husband hated the size of the unit on the counter and they bought a refrigerator that filters water. I've had that unit for about a year and a half and it has stopped working now. I will call Tersano but I expect that they will tell me to try a filter but if its not the filter I will have to buy a new unit. This product looses a star for the short life span and another for the time it takes to replace. If I order the filter today I won't be able to get it for at least a week, probably more and then it's not guaranteed to fix the problem. That's just lame. Three stars for excellent water quality when it does work. I wish it was a 5 star product because I just love this thing when it's working."
2,Just breaks to fast....,"We bought the second lotus machine in 2 years and it broke again in less than a year. We really like the water, when it works but it just breaks to easily. Therefore it is just too expensive. I guess we will be looking for a new system."
5,Great Co. and System!,"I bought my first system 2002 and it was wonderful but it develeoped problems,(2) yrs later,it was out of warranty and I called Tesoro and they shipped me a brand new unit right away, no questions asked, thats how dedicated to their product they are, and I can only give the system a 10 ++ it does everything they say and more in my opinion, I haven't bought bottled water in years. I hated water until I bought this system, its worth every penney~ Thanks for letting me write this review!"
1,BAD - BAD - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"This is really a piece of garbage. Do NOT buy this.When I tried to put it together I was shocked at how cheap the material was. The plastic seemed almost used and brittle. The top portion that goes over the filter to encase and draw out the water DID NOT FIT no matter what I tried. Short of jamming it on there and breaking it (Which I wasn't willing to risk) there was no way to even get the machine running. Even the packaging the product came in seemed used, as if they repackaged a used machine and box and thought the consumer was too stupid to notice.For me, that alone was enough to return this with all possible haste. My vote is to NOT buy this machine as it is cheaply made and the instruction do not seem to cover anything beyond very basic assembly."
1,poor quality,"my son could not even play with these toys....the capes would not stay on, and the light sabers just bend and fall off!If I didn't have to pay for shipping, I would just return this item!! NOT WORTH IT!"
3,all cartoons by marvin townsend,"these is a 94 pages paperback of all marvin townsend cartoons. these cartoons look like they were drawn back in the1960s. marvin's humor is very subtle and charming for kids and adults. one of my favorites in this book is on page 60.a man is in front of a book shelf titled,""ghost stories"". a rather exuberant looking ghost is popping outof the book shelf,holding a book towards the startled man saying,""here's one i'm sure you'll enjoy!""."
3,"Not as good as ""Now"" but has it's moments","This CD starts out very promising with 4 great tracks. But from there it starts to slide downhill, with only a few great moments. ""Love Rains"" is ruined by some female singer who appears to be trying to hard, and comes across about as soulful as Cher. The song ""Drifters"" is evidently the single, which is a colossal error in judgement, since that is the worst track.Well enough, bashing, this CD does contain some powerful moments, mostly on tracks like ""Freedom"" and ""Deep Blue"". The stand-out song is without a doubt ""Find a Way"", a ballad that would be very comfortable on Paul's '97 ""NOW"" album.Many of the sounds on this CD are reminisent of Bad Company's Burning Sky era stuff. Most notably ""Jasmine Flower"" and the flute tinged ""Over You"".So is this CD worth owning? The answer is yes, if you are a Paul Rodgers fan like myself. Much better than ""Cut Loose"", not quite as good as ""Now""."
4,Get electrified!,"Paul Rodgers never ceases to amaze,it's like he discovered the secret of eternal youth and never ending musical inspiration.His new album 'Electric',while not as heavy as 1997's 'Now',is another excursion into timeless rock'n'roll:Rodgers has a way of making it all count-he adds a veritable Midas touch to everything he sings,and all his instrumental and compositional skills."
5,Best Christmas album I've ever owned!,"I have had ""Christmas Time with the Judds"" for years, and look forward to December when I can pull it out of the Christmas box again. I actually carry it around with me during the Christmas season so I can listen to it anywhere; alas, it recently fell into the hands of my one-year-old and was destroyed. I will now buy two so I can have one on hand in case such a disaster occurs again. I am not generally a fan of country music, but the harmonies of Wynonna and Naomi are unmatched in richness and quality. I strongly recommend this cd to anyone."
2,Beautiful star of Bethlelhem,"There are better versions of this beautiful song. Plus, I was billed for two when only ordered one. What do I do with the second one?"
2,Blah blah,"I had to set the book down, maybe I will finish it later. The book starts off with a bang,but begins to bog down as it delves into the social background of some of the people involved. I had to stop a few times and wonder if I had accidentally switched to a different book on my Kindle."
1,Table Fan,I purchased this fan less than 60 days ago in a different color and from a different source. I was very pleased with it until it suddenly started dripping black oil from the motor. Since we leave it on while we sleep I find this scary.
3,fits small,"this shirt is much smaller fit than i expected, it doesnt even fit my son. but he really likes the picture."
4,A BLAST FROM THE PAST,Great driving music for the parts of I-10W where there is only a suggested speed limit. Ely puts as much energy into these tracks as is humanly possible and has fun on the way. A great listen.Please note that track 11 is a bonus cut on the CD version. It's really a non-essential song but is not available in previous LP or cassette releases.
1,Flawed copies,"I ordered my new copy of this book anticipating that it would be a fabulous resource. When I recived my copy I was sad to discover that one page was folded into the binding and unusable. When a replacement copy arrived, it was in worse shape that the first -- pages 255-286 were missing and the binding was starting to come apart. While the contents look superb, who wants to take the chance of having to accept such poorly assembled products! Be careful! From my experience Oxford and Harper Collins dictionaries are a safer bet!!"
2,Doesn't glow...,"It hasn't broke or anything yet, but it doesn't glow I held it up to a light for forever and then shut the lights off and it doesn't glow."
1,The worst book i have ever read,This was a stereotypical depiction of indians that showed the worst stereostypes instead of the best. The book was also just crude crude crude and had no real meaningful plot.
1,Boring or Banal?,"Chapatti or chips is a waste to money and time, unless you are the kind who believes in modern day fairy tales.The prince in this trashy novel is a guy who walks around with seemingly only two missions in life - to bed as many women and run his DuMBELLS gym as a business ( dumb...bells...quite right). The female protagonist is confused, rejects a seemingly awrite Indian guy to slather after the sex maniac, who she loves because he is ..mean to her. The only redeeming feature about the novel are the side characters, namely the Indian father who is utterly relatable, ironically funny and naturally ambitious for his daughters to marry decent indian men. Stupid stereotypes, wafer thin story, mind furrowing emotions, and yawn inducing climaxes ( the ones in the novel I mean)!"
1,bloody awful,"I really want to read books that are about 2nd generation indians in the west, hence i picked up this book but its awful. the plot is stupid and the characters have no depth. I want to support writers so that this genre grows but i can't support crap like this. please don't waste your time or money."
2,Refund please! :p,"I've discovered the secret to most of Nisha Minhas's books. The formula is the same. Take a hot white guy. Make him a philanderer, a total b@$!~^d, and unavailable when it comes to his feelings. Add a beautiful Indian girl who is torn between being Indian and British. And presto! You've got a story. I'm not exactly sure what I was thinking when I picked this book up, I should have learned my lesson after the first four, but then I thought, ""Maybe it'll be different."" Well there is one more left and knowing myself I'll probably read that too. But the point is if you've read one book of hers, you've read them all. And if you didn't like it, then you won't like any of the others either."
4,Women's lives in narrow straits,"Set in an Ultra-Orthodox community in Jerusalem, this dark and fascinating film tells the story of two sisters. One is happily married but childless. The intense spiritual, emotional and physical link between the husband and wife is palpable- but the husband is being pressured to divorce her. He is required to fulfill the commandment to ""be fruitful and multiply."" The younger sister is about to be married off to a man she dislikes. The pace is a little slow, but the story is very sad and beautifully detailed."
2,Inaccurate but...,"I grew up in modern orthodox judaism in England and studied at an ultraorthodox yeshiva in Jerusalem close to where the movie was set, have ultraorthodox relatives etc. but am now secular myself. A lot of the ritual aspects of the movie especially the scenes in the synagogue/yeshiva were inaccurate. I couldn't determine if they were Sephardi (Middle Eastern Jews) or Ashkenazi (European Jews) - some bizarre mix in the middle - Meah She'arim is a primarily Ashkenazi neighborhood. The wedding was the most bizarre... . Perhaps the producers were short of money to hire extras. The whole feel was very unrealistic as a result.To an outsider a lot of the context wouldn't be clear as can be seen from some of the other commentaries here. The overall themes though if more contextualized aren't totally out of place at all, though I know it is an anti-Orthodox movie, but these are important issues. However, the end result is really messed up and detracts from getting the message across."
2,A Little Bit Of Truth and A Whole Lotta Lies,"This movie shows the beauty of some things Jewish and at the same time shows those beautiful things as sad repulsive.In the scene of the wedding the women seems to be taken away from her festivities. In reality the woman and the man each celebrate with their friends (so the men and women do not mix.) In the film, she looks as if she is done and on her way home. I have yet to be at an orthodox wedding that was like that.Also, there are some truths in this movie. But the vast majority of the truth has been clouded by misuse of context. I add this movie to others like Price Above Rubies for showing the most blatent damaging look at orthodox people with the worst amount of personal prejudice thrown in for effect."
4,Do a little more research,"This is an unusual and eye-opening film. It prompted me to search for more information on Mea Sherim on a search engine and I found one excellent background article on a travel site. (The inquisitive traveller.) I am grateful to this film for spurring my research as I now understand more about the volatile secular-religious situation in Israel than I would ever have learned otherwise. The situation - like the film - is fascinating, depressing, and above all important."
3,OK as a drama about the problem of being childlessness.,"A film in the category of ""Yerma"" by Federico Garcia-Lorca but not of its dramatic depth. Totally misleading as a peep into the world of ultru orthodox Jewish life. A film with a few nice scenes and occasional well made sequences but ultimately two-dimensional and lacking dramatic force."
5,Excellent,This was my first book by Julianne MacLean and I'm anxious to read more. I couldn't put it down. I look forward to her second book in this American Heiress series!
3,Average,"This book was just a ok read for me. The heroine was a little too perfect in every way, and the hero was just cruel most of the time and then nice and then cruel again it got a little tedious at times, but overall it was ok. I did not feel alot of sexual tension, or a real compelling love story in the book but not all reads can be true treasures. The other characters in the book were alittle one-dimensional for me and the heros excuse for not wanting to love - ? I would have hoped the author would have come up with something a little better because after I finished the book I still could believe that was all there was to it."
3,Just ok,"I've read worse books than this. I've also read better. I agreewith other reviewers the H didn't have to grovel at all for the h to forgive him. He treated her like crap and she always sucked on it. Overall, this was just an average read."
2,Average rehash of a tired theme,"The author says she read ""The Buccaneers"" by Edith Wharton, and you can save some money by just reading the original classic. It's the usual too-handsome hero with a wounded past, marrying the too-beautiful and so-wealthy heroine. Decades of misunderstandings are cleared up in a trice by her charm and brave forebearance. Standard sex scenes and the let's-make-everybody-happy ending complete another run-of-the-mill historical."
3,Good beginning....,"I liked the beginning of this book - the characters were interesting and seemed complex - but then the book just stopped working. I found myself being pulled out of the book because the things the characters were doing and saying just didn't seem right. Yes, the hero and heroine are supposed to grow and change through the course of the novel, but not to the point that they're unrecognizable by the end, which was the case with James, the hero of the novel. And don't get me started on the rest of his family!I gave this 3 stars, because there were glimmers of greatness in this book. I just hope the author finds someone to bounce storylines off of who will tell her the truth, as in ""there's no way the reader will ever believe the mother-in-law you've created would do this."""
5,"Wow! Sensual, hard to put down, great!",Sophia and James had a beautiful and fascinating story. I cried at the end even though it was completely happy -- the story was that involved for me (and I rarely cry). This should be a best-selling author. Her books are keepers. I can not wait for the promised sequel about Sophia's sister. (From someone who has read hundreds or probably over a thousand novels by now...)
2,all computerized=embroidery?,"For on-line buyers, it's nice book to use if you have a embroidery machine, not just a computerized machine. the title is a bit misleading because not all computerized machines can perform the task which embroidery machines can do. Besides, the book seems to advocate mostly not only on the top of the line machines but also softwares as well. For those alreay own a embroidery machine, softwares, and special scanner, I doubted that they would run out of ideas and need help from this book."
2,Very Disappointing,"This book is a waste of money unless you know nothing about dogs. If you want pertinant information specific to the Lab, then look elsewhere. The words ""Laborador Retriever"" could be deleted and the name of any dog breed inserted."
2,THE FADING OF A DIVA!,"Diana Ross is a recognize voice of the industry and this album is to damn Boring!, she's more known as a Uplifting artist, she should know that!. Try other Ross Albums. The best cuts though is DIRTY LOOKS AND SHOCK WAVES!. Great cover photos and design well she's Diana Ross, but the music still missing!."
1,This album is BORING,"Many Diana Ross fans didn't like her RCA years, but I'm one of the fans who thought she released some of her best work during her time there. HOWEVER, this album is the exception - Red Hot is so boring! It's starts off great with the sexy Dirty Looks, and then the equally sexy Stranger In Paradise, but after that it's just a mess. The rest of the songs are plain, boring, and dated.Since this was her last contractual album with RCA, maybe she just didn't care anymore at this point and didn't put in much effort since she knew she was leaving anyway, but still, when something's got your name on it, you need to make sure it will be something you'll be proud of later on. It's no wonder this album was her worst selling RCA album."
5,This is a great deal,I was looking for clove oil and here it is at Amazon. I probably have enough to last me 'til the end of time but it was a price I couldn't pass up. I'll pass it along to my friends who make candy and pickles and it only costs a few cents. Very happy with this purchase and this product.
5,It's what PK&M are all about!!!,"Top to bottom probably my favorite PK&M; record. I have been a long time fan (since 1988) and find myself returning to these older recordings more and more. His new stuff is good, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the somewhat less polished and more raw stuff he did in his earlier years.I will always buy everything he releases, because of loyality and because he is so damn good. What i wouldn't give for a new PK&M; record (with the remaining members). One can hold out hope...can't one."
4,Australia Fair.,"I'm a New Zealander, so take it from me, this guy is good. He's not in danger of toppling Neil Finn from his antipodean throne, but this is a truly evocative and strangely catchy little album.It is quintessentially Australian. The anthem ""Adelaide"" is this collection's brilliant cornerstone, and elsewhere it boasts little rippers like ""Before The Old Man Died"", ""I Won't Be Torn Apart"" and ""Leaps And Bounds"".Just buy it if you think you might like it. You can always give it away. Go on, it's good, I promise."
4,Still a great recording,"I think the recording is over 30 years old now, but it still sounds fresh. Definitely worth picking up."
2,Quality Control Lacking,"The quality control on this is lacking.(1) The screw holes drilled into the top shelf for the side handle did not align, forcing you to start the screws yourself on one side (without using the pre-drilled holes).(2) There were dark stains on the wood slats that could not be removed, even with abrasive cleaner (see photos)(3) The top shelf is two separate sections. One section is a little higher than the other on one side, which means the top shelf is not flat across the entire top."
3,Just OK,"I purchased this cart so that I could transport food and dishes from the kitchen, which is in the front of my house, to the patio bar-b-q in the back and because I could fold it and put it away.The construction is not that good. The slats are bowed and one joint in the bottom shelf came apart as soon as we put it together. Also, when folded, there is no way for it to stand up, so now it sits in my kitchen full time, which I didn't want.It does give me a lot of room to bring everything outside in one trip."
2,NOT A BAD PIECE,"ORDERED TWO - ONE ARRIVED SMASHED. PROMPT REPLACEMENT. NOT THE BEST CONSTRUCTION, BUT LOOKS NICE AND THE FOLDING FEATURE IS WONDERFUL. A UNIQUE AND HANDY DESIGN. CASTER LOCKS AREN'T THE BEST EITHER, BUT WORK OK."
1,Horrible quality,Finished wood was scratched and dented. Screws were stripped and couldn't be used. Holes did not line up to assemble. It was a nightmare to put together and I am still waiting on extra screws from the manufacturer.
4,Great for small kitchens!,"This guy is PERFECT for tiny kitchens with no counter space. Set up was pretty straightforward. I don't see the need for the knife block on the side, I wouldn't trust putting knives and rolling it around but that's just me. I love the extra storage it offers and so far we haven't folded to store but I honestly don't see how it could truly ""fold"" to save space. I feel like it takes up a lot of space still but I just love the storage it provides already. Greatest kitchen investment ever."
3,Nice cart,The directions were very difficult to understand. The were totally unclear. When it got put together it is a very nice cart.
5,Bizzare - 30 years war - erbildungsroman - Candide -,"I have read three of this series and am amazed by the core of what Grmm. was saying. Let alone the historical magnitude of a novel like this (One of the first printed material available after Guttenburg did his thing). This guy printed out what seems to me essentially the first Superman comic books. Each chapter of the three (or more) books in this series was printed as a serial. Precursor in some ways to Kafka? Simple(sic) is a hero and a knave. His love (and her Courage) now a gypsy fortuneteller, his old friend a beggar. Of course Simple finds God in the end, but it is old German stuff ain't it!"
3,Prayer of Jabez Bible Study Review,"The Prayer of Jabez Bible Study is designed to take you deeper into a way of humbly approaching God and asking for His blessing. There's no magical purpose of the prayer, so the emphasis is on how we come to God and petition Him and what we can anticipate from God in responding to His children, who are obedient to Him. The short Bible Study does not require video or outside resources other than your Bible and an openness to discuss God's word."
3,Wrong edition,"I wanted the kindle edition of the original book. I did like the original book, and wanted to take it with me."
2,Start Over,"I didn't think this book was a very satisfying read. It talks about the prayer of a little known Bible hero. It instructs you to leave the past behind. For me, that is quitting drugs. I first got into drugs when I was 13 or 14. I remained perpetuallly stoned until I was 26. As you do drugs you stop maturing mentally. It impairs your judgement and motivation."
1,Prayer of Jabez Bible Study,"This book was well used. It was handwritten over half of the pages in black ink and not fit for study. Someone's scribbled opinions leaves no room for other interpretations. This is the seller's fault. It should never have been labeled ""good"" condition. (sold by bearbooks)"
5,Challenge to Discipleship,"This is a must read for every Christian! I was introduced to this book at a men's prayer breakfast. A man stood up and testified to the power of this prayer. He highly recommended this book. I bought a copy and read it over a couple of days during carpool time. It challenges the reader to pray Jabez' prayer asking for God to bless me + expand my territory + keep me from evil that I might not cause pain. What a terrific prayer! Bruce illustrates the parts of the prayer with explanations and illustrations of how it's worked in his life. I now pray this every day, resting in the knowledge that God will answer this prayer with exciting opportunities and blessings."
3,The two CD deluxe album is one CD too many!,First the good news. If I was rating the single CD version of this recording I would have given it a rating of five stars; the score from the motion picture is an overlooked and underplayed gem. Unfortunately I am rating the deluxe version (two CDs with illustrated pamphlet); the second CD contains selections that weren't included in the soundtrack....one listen to the second CD will make the listener painfully aware of why these selections weren't included in the the original soundtrack....they're awful. The price of the two CD Deluxe version is not worth double the price of the single CD version. The only thing I play from the second CD is Jeff Daniels' reading of the Gettysburg Address; it should have been included on the first CD. Go with the single CD version....it's worth every penny.
2,looks great but doesn't last long,my baby is now 6 weeks old and the bag is already broken. The side strap nylon belt is becoming unraveled and will soon come off.
2,way too twitchy,"The product fits my son very well. As a matter of fact, it fit me just fine. The problem is with the trigger mechanism. It is way too twitchy. I mean, the trigger is exessively light. You can't look at it wrong and it engages. Not a very safe release for a child or adult. Wouldn't recommend it at all."
3,As Expected,Item works as described. Bought this for my son and he has had no problems with it. Would recommend for any youth or small hunter.
1,not what i expected,the product is beautiful but not durable. it is coming loose at the seems and i haven't even had it 2 months....not satisfied...
4,"After listening to St. Anger, I've now found a real metal CD","If you think you may like Anthrax, and you don't have any of their discs, buy this. If you think you may want to hear the best metal CD in 5 years, buy this. If you thought you would get your fix from the new Metallica CD, buy this."
5,"TALK ABOUT ""TAKING THE MUSIC BACK""","I have been an Anthrax fan since Among the Living came out. So thats like 16 years. This is by far the BEST of any I've EVER listened to. Blows away Persistence of Time and Stomp 442 (Read my review on Stomp). Please quit reading this and just BUY IT NOW. As Scott Ian says ""You won't be dissapointed, I GUARANTEE IT!!!!"""
2,................,"When this came out I had already considered myself a fan of ""Spreading the Disease"" and ""Among the Living"", and had just started to get into ""The Sound of White Noise."" So I had zero pretensions about Bush, or even their slower and less thrashy guitar direction they had taken since acquiring him on the aforementioned album. The issue for me is the sheer redundancy of the riffs. There are a bunch of ""blocky"" sounding chug-a-thons that really do nothing for me. ""What Doesn't Die"" despite being one of the worst offenders of that formula is actually one of the best on here. ""Cadillac Rock Box"" has a nasty guitar riff, and really doesn't sound like anything else on here. Had they taken the album in the direction of that song I would have liked it alot more. There were a few other songs I got into, but on the whole I can't really say I care for this one."
5,should be #1 everywhere,"As an avid listener of anthrax since ""among the living"" I can only say thank you for this release. It's dynamic, full of energy and enriched with emotion you can't find on the radio today. Not one song will lose your attention, these guys are still running strong and hopefully will continue to do so for years to come. Pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,If you only buy 1 cd this year make sure this is the one!!,"Judge an album buy it's cover!!!This is the best piece of art I've ever seen.But it has more........it's the best METAL CD you are gonna hear this year!!!It has it all, it's hard , it's fast , it's agressive, it has great melodies and killer chorusses.Anthrax at theire best.Check out songs like ""What Doesn't Die"", ""Refuse to be Denied"", ""Nobody Knows Anything"" or ""Cadillac Rock Box"", it doesn't get any better then this.Also included a limited vinyl 7 "". HORNS UP!!"
2,Could be better,"Other than the title track, What doesnt die, Nobody knows anything and Refuse to be denied, this album is kind of weak. It could be a lot faster with more of Benante's signature double bass. It's heavy but it lacks the energy of their older albums. It sounds like they're trying to produce radio hits, but they have no mainstream potential and they might as well stick to what made their older stuff successful, Energy, originality, and more humorous songs (ie:Startin up a posse, NFL, I am the law, Bring the noise, I'm the man) . Otherwise It's about time they hung up their instruments for good before they recycle more material on their next album like they did with this one and the 2 albums before that."
2,A refusal to age gracefully,"It must be hard for a band to remain a viable outfit yet still realise they are never going to recapture their past glories. Since jettisoning the increasingly ludicrous Joey Belladonna in favour of the leather lunged vocal powerhouse that is John Bush, Anthrax has enjoyed mixed fortunes and become very familiar with the law of diminishing returns. It's a shame, because when they get it right, as on What Doesn't Die and the stupendous Safe Home (unbelievably a song which brings to mind a mix of Rocket From The Crypt and Survivor!), they still sound like worldbeaters and show their peers how it's done- put this against St. Anger and see which stays in your cd deck the longer; it's just that, as with their last album (Volume 8-The Threat Is Real) the highs are spaced too far apart to really offer much hope of a sustained return to form. If you can, get hold of the limited edition which comes with a bonus cd collection of some of their more interesting cover versions"
1,What the...?,"Is this some swort of joke?!This isn't the real Anthrax as we know them. They should have changed thier name after Joey left, so it wouldn't of mattered if they'd change it after the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax envolopes. If you want real metal, then you would generaly have to go back to the 80's and early 90's. That's when everything was mostly better.The same goes for the last albums that came out with John."
1,Anthrax should be called Nu-thrax..haha,"I really can't believe people actually like this weak music. Anthrax only has 3 good albums, Fistful of metal, Spreading the disease, and Among the living. In other words, Anthrax has sucked now for about 17 years. Whoa, thats longer than Nu-tallica has sucked. Anthrax is just worthless. None of them can play anymore, it's just all jumpriffs that any band could play. When they fired Joey belladona, they killed themselves for good. John Bush is one of the worst vocalists ever. Their bassist Frank Bella realized how bad they were sucking, so he decided to quit. haha. Slayer is the only band of the ""big four"" that still plays metal. I don't know what Dave Mustaine is doing with Megadeth, he might just do some kinda dumb solo album. But anyway Anthrax has been Nu-thrax ever since they got John Bush. They need to just quit and die for good. And just for the record, all Nu-metal is for sissy little girls and f@gs. Long live Death."
3,First impressions,"Have only had a chance to spin this one a few times since picking it up on my lunch hour today... first impressions:1: Music and vocals are pretty good. Not as great as Sound Of White Noise or the earlier classics, but there are some good tracks.2: I liked Anthrax more when their lyrics were less typical ""God is dead"" metal lyrics. Not that every song on this album is, but it seems like kind of a crutch.3: If Sound of White Noise is your favorite Anthrax album, you'll love this one. If Persistence of Time is your favorite, you'll like this one. If some other album is your favorite, you're crazy or something. :)"
2,Boring,"I've read lots of reviews saying that Anthrax's finally back. And let me tell you, that's not true. ""We've come for..."" is not Anthrax's comeback, and is not better than metallica's St. Anger, nor Megadeth's ""The World Needs A hero"", these three albums are desperate desires in re-gain the strength and speed, but they're such failures.OK, this album is more solid and consistent than Stomp 442, but there's no thrash, just a couple of good, aggresive and well-delivered songs that's all. When Anthrax's sound changed with the release of SOund Of White Noise i was pretty much OK, and in fact loved it more than other Anthrax's albums of the ""Belladona era"". So i don't have a problem with the vocals or whatever, it's just plain boring."
3,Great Album! But still not like their old stuff!,"Just picked up new Anthrax cd. Best cd they've done since Joey Belladonna left the band as lead vocalist. I always was a bigger fan of Anthrax with Joey as lead.. (sorry John) but I will say this is thier best cd since John Bush took over lead vocals. Now John is good but Joey was my favorite.I love the STRONG drumbeats! Keep it up Charlie!The cd has some awesome tracks! I especially love ""What Doesn't Die"", you can not kill what doesn't die...it goes..I also especially love ""Safe Home"" VERY catchy metal! I also like the rips in track #8 ""Strap It On""!! Great collection of good metal!! If you liked the older Anthrax cds this cd is harder but still you can hear the old similaries...which is good. You'd like it especially if you liked ""Sounds Of White Noise"". But its better. Best cd yet with John Bush in lead vocals.. Its a keeper.(I still prefer Among The Living as their BEST cd ever though)."
5,Excellent Summary,"In The Everything Jesus Book, Jon Kennedy successfully tackles a monumental task - concisely summarizing the life of Jesus, his teaching and his impact on humanity for more than two-millennia.Beginning with Jesus' birth, Kennedy offers an insightful overview of history (as it relates to Christ) up to the present day. Information is well organized into 20 chapters that truly address everything you want to know about Jesus' life, legacy and even future return. The book includes basics in church history and theology, as well as a discussion on the state of modern Christianity. Readers will find useful explanations of familiar religious terms (whose definitions are often unknown even to Christians), and helpful distinctions between Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions.If your interest is limited to a particular topic, a comprehensive index will assist you in navigating through the book."
1,"Kimberley Jim, I have no review . I sure would like to know as much as possible about this movie","I do not know anything about this movie Would like to learn as much as possibleWhat kind of movie is it: comedy, western or drama."
5,"A heartfelt movie, true to the story","Andy Garcia couldn't have done a better job producing a movie that is so true to what Cuba has gone through, not just since Fidel came to power, but also what the pre-1959 Cuba was like. As a Cuban-born (same age as Andy), I felt his message and enjoyed the music in the movie so much, I bought the soundtrack CD as well!"
2,"Good content / topic, but unfortunately, a boring movie","1. The content / subject of the movie is certainly worth having on film and I wish there were a really good movie on the Cuban revolution and topics related to it. Unfortunately, this movie is basically boring. There's a lot of critical things I've said about a lot of different movies, but plain old boring is pretty rare these days, except for this film.2. Some very tangential thoughts:a. Bill Murray: what's up with his character? Perhaps it's based on someone that Andy Garcia knew / knows, but the character came off as being very odd / strange, in the unrealistic manner.b. Dustin Hoffman as a mob character? Terrible writing and terrible acting.c. Just with emphasis on the family, I just kept thinking of... ""The Godfather"", a much much much better film with Andy Garcia in it."
4,A powerful and artistic story of Cuba,"Thank you to Andy Garcia for making this film. This is a story that needs to be told again and again. The Lost City tells the story of Cuba in a way that is moving and artistic with a mix of narrative, history, dance and music. What has happened to Havana and Cuba is a tragedy. This tragedy is portrayed metaphorically in this film through the story of one family and one love that are both torn apart. Two thumbs up from me.... May there one day be freedom in Cuba.p.s. But can we somehow edit Bill Murray's character out of the movie???"
5,CD of Celia Cruz-Resumen Musical,I was extremely pleased with the prompt response to my order; good seller. I will buy more from this seller.
5,A place you leave is a place that lives forever,"This is an Excellent film, it shows Cuba in the late 1950s. Andy my brother I can't be more proud of you. Thank you for making this movie happen."
2,My sympathy...,"My sympathy to Andy Garcia for trying so hard. I love him and as a Cuban I wanted to keep the movie as a collectors item but, they could had done so much better..."
5,A superb film,"Andy Garcia, son of Cuban immigrants, traces the darkest moments experienced by a bourgeois family trapped by the Revolution. Andy Garcia gives a just farewell to Guevara myth that appears as in itself, minister of justice exception (the courts of exception) responsible for serial murders, crimes (finally! How long I expected for a movie Very dangerous and pale Guevara.The passions. Trouble when bribing a Batista, gangrene American Mafia (though described in ""Havana"" the thriller by Stephen Hunter) disputed the bloody communism.Andy Garcia issues a superb history. Bravo."
5,LOST CITY A REALITY,"I purchased several copies (5) of Lost City. Why, you may ask. Well, I gave 4 away to close friends who were interested in what happened in Cuba and Castro in the early 1960's.I lived those days in Cuba as a teenager; experienced the radical changes in the government structure, the theft of Cuban's personal homes, properties and businesses....so, I know first hand what happened and what was depicted in this video by Andy Garcia - a fellow Cuban-American.Also, I happened to have a very close friend, Peter Dominguez Fox, nephew of Martin Fox, the owner of Tropicana Nightclub which is depicted as the nightclub in the video. I visited Tropicana many times with Peter and other friends that were American born and Cuban raised or Cuban born and American raised like myself. I recommend this video without reservations."
4,"ANDY GARCIA, OPUS 1","***1/2 2005. Directed by Andy Garcia. Havana, Cuba. 1958. The Fellove family belongs to the Cuban high bourgeoisie with at his head Don Federico, a university professor. Don Federico's eldest son, Fico, is the owner of a famous night club while his two brothers are politically engaged. Dictator Batista's regime is soon threatened by Fidel Castro and his comrades. The screenplay of the first film directed by Andy Garcia is obviously and, let's admit it, rather elementarily anti-Castrist. The unique fully-developed point of view is the point of view of the Cuban bourgeoisie, the characters of Luis, Aurora and Ricardo Fellove, who are pro-Castrists, being anecdotal at the most. If you can disregard this preconception, the film is interesting, above average and you'll certainly appreciate a couple of scenes featuring Bill Murray and Dustin Hoffman. Recommended."
5,Heartbreaking but excellent movie,"I am so glad that I watched this movie - it is a powerful and moving story. The film did not get the credit that it so richly deserved. The cinematography was stellar. Andy Garcia did a fantastic job of directing. Bill Murray and Dustin Hoffman were slightly annoying and threw the balance of the movie off somewhat. Probably the reason that the film was not praised in Hollywood and the critic world, is because it was NOT pro-Castro. It was more of a family saga and love story than a detailed account of the Battista, Che Guerrera, and Castro atrocities, so I think that needs to be taken into account when viewing it. Definitely a film to watch!"
3,"Interesting topic, Boring movie","The Cuba revolution is an interesting topic. But this movie moves way too slow and didn't hold my interest. If this movie had been 80 minutes instead of 140, it would have been alot better."
1,"Been There, Done That","This film has more meaning to people who experienced what this film is about as I did. I am Cuban and left the island in 1962. As a Pedro Pan kid, I can tell you Mr. Garcia has done one heck of a job, with friends and not much cash, to tell what happened in those early days of the of ""Our"" Lost City. Congratulations to him and all the people who gave of their time and talent to make his dream come true. If you're a Cuban, don't miss this movie. If you're not, what the heck, watch it anyway. I bet you'll understand more than you do right now.Maria Hernandez Mills"
2,Political Propaganda,"Pro american view of events at that time. The story was good, but too much of a political statement for me."
5,Andy Garcia scores again,"This is Andy Garcia's second movie on the impact of Fidel's revolution on the lives of Cubans, especially the musical artists. Beautifully filmed, great music, with excellent character & plot development, it shows that while Cuban life under Batista was far from ideal, things got much worse under Castro.We had a little difficulty following the characters early on. Bill Murray's role seemed puzzling an superfluous at times, but at other times, the wry wit & observations were right on. The extra feature interview of Garcia quotes Murray as saying he loved the script & wanted to particpate, even though no one would see the movie. Bill is obviously a smart Hollywood guy as the film got very little theater play, a real sad commentary on what the American public wants. I highly recommend this movie along with Garcia's other Cuban film ""For Love or Country - The Arturo Sandoval Story"""
4,An underrated film now available in HD!!!,"First off, this movie is well done. Sure Bill Murray's character seems random, and I wish Dustin Hoffman would have had a bigger role, but still, it is a beautiful film. Andy Garcia captured a Casablanca-ish feel and the Cinematography is top-notch. I have a copy of the film on DVD and this HD-DVD is a BIG improvement. There are some minor artifacts in a couple of scenes, but that's it(I have 50 inch 1080P LED DLP). Check it out."
5,Going on 48,"Andy Garc√≠a has remarkably recreated the suffering that countless Cuban families went through, and some are still undergoing, as a result of the tyranny of Fidel Castro. I left Cuba when I was 15 years old and watching The Lost City brought tears to my eyes. I too had to leave my parents behind, luckily reuniting with them after only 9 months. I went through the personal search at the airport in Havana, just like the movie depicts. Thank you Andy!"
2,Boring and scattered,"This movie is about a nightclub owner in Cuba shortly before Castro took power and thereafter. It is too long and tries to cover too many things. As a result, it never develops any drama or tension and the characters never develop into people you understand or care about."
1,DISSAPOINTMENT,I NEVER RECEIVED THE DVD! I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE REFUND!HOPE YOU CAN HELP!GRAZIELLA URIARTE DE HAGERMAN
5,An overlooked 80's Classic,"Buy this now ! Every song is great, a truly great 80's classic album, unfortunately they never really capitalized on their embry of success with Painted moon, not sure whose fault that is but it's unfortunate. Better late than never, buy it now !"
4,Good Pop from Saint Paul,"Meaning Sir Paul McCartney? Maybe. Reminds me a lot of The Fixx, Tears for Fears and XTC. And they could for sure have influenced Fountains of Wayne in later years. Very catchy pop for a quiet summer in the woods sorrounded by precious lakes and lots of action. A classic of it's time."
1,she is so annoying,"I loved the title and grabbed this book on impulse off of the new books shelf at my local library. A couple of hours later I was very disappointed. The author has some good basic ideas (albeit a bit trite) but they are clogged by the tales of her version of ""the good life""--a round-the-world trip at age 16, multiple trips to Bermuda and Paris, her meals at the ""finest restaurants in New York"". I especially loved the part when she gently chides her readers to ease back on some of the technological demands of their jobs, as she does thanks to her three assistants. I can't afford to pay someone to screen my e-mails for me, and funny, my boss doesn't seem to be receptive to picking up the tab either. Some of her examples are alienating, insensitive, and insulting to the readers out there who are squeaking by financially and can't afford to have a dress made for themselves in Hong Kong. I will never pick up another book by Alexandra Stoddard."
4,You are your choices,I enjoy Alexandra Stoddards books. This book was also very good. You can pick it up and read a small section at a time which is very nice if you are busy. Its just a short pick me up to get the day going on a positive note.
2,Nothing new,Well written as all of hers are. Yet it seemed to drag on for me and repeat the same thoughts chapter after chapter
4,The Dead Matter: 3-Disc Deluxe Edition DVD,"I went to ""The Dead Matter"" world premiere on Sat. Oct. 3rd 2009 at ""Tower City Ctr."" in Cleveland, OH., I'll tell you what this movie was well done and may become a Cult favorite down the road. Edward Douglas really knows how to make a good movie, He originally made this movie in 1996 on a minimal budget, Douglas was never really happy with the final results of This film. In 2007 he was given an estimated $2,000,000 to re-do the film the way he had intended, The whole film was shot from August 6th through Sept. 1st 2007. This just shows how Douglas and His Crew can make a Very Good movie when you have the Budget to do so. Also the music by ""Midnight Syndicate"" flowed so smoothly through out the movie, It just made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. It's a different type of Horror movie, with a twist and not a lot of gore. I don't know when this movie will be released domestically, but if you do get a chance to see it - DO NOT MISS IT!"
3,Goofy story but kind of fun,"I did not totally follow this wacky story of a scarab pendant, some vampires (?), and a zombie made into a companion/pet, but it was rather entertaining in its silliness."
2,The Dead Matter not,"Not to burst anyone's bubble, but this film isn't that great. In fairness, it's obvious that those that made it gave it their best shot and made it with heart. And, there are some good ideas here. Still, the film is convoluted, suffers from poor pacing, editing and looks cheap. It also does a poor job trying to decide if it's a horror film or satire. One scene meant for laughs features a zombie drinking beer in a pub, a funny idea. Amazingly the crowd in the bar doesn't even notice the monster and the joke just dies. Beloved Cleveland celeb Big Chuck has a cameo but isn't given much to do, which is a shame. Midnight Syndicate is known for their music but the score feels overproduced for this kind of B movie carnage and intrudes more than enhances the movie. Listening to the soundtrack (which is very good) by itself would be the better option. I have to note that the beautiful DVD cover artwork is truly awesome."
1,Disappointing,"My wife and I were very disappointed by this movie. It received very good grades from certain horror type magazines;however, said publications tend to give an A for effort and low budgets while failing their fans. There is nothing in this movie that can replace or be an improvement over Evil Dead II."
5,Best choice for most jazz applications,"A custom mouthpiece refinisher recommended I switch to Rico Jazz Select, and boy was he right. The advantage of this reed is the evenness of the strength in each box, allowing more grades of strength. If you find Java 2.5 too soft, but Java 3 to be too hard, the RJS 3-Soft sits almost exactly in between. Similarly the 3-Hard stand between Java 3 and 3.5. In addition, I have found the table of these reeds to be more consistently flat than the current crop of Vandorens, requiring less preparation to get a good seal with the mouthpiece, and the evenness from side to side is better. If you want to prepare reeds so that even more of them are usable, the two best tools for perfecting reeds are the ReedGeek and the ATG Reed Preparation system. Between these two tools and RJS reeds, I now get exactly what I'm looking for in a reed, about 9 times in 10."
5,good value,these reeds are the only reeds I use with my tenor sax usins a 6* Brillhart mouthpiece. I can go from the box to playing with very little break-in
5,my current favs in 3.5 or 4,"This reeds gets a great Getz type sound with a long faced metal MP like a Ottolink 7*. 3's wear too fast, so 4 is better...."
2,Too cloudy,"We bought this for my son's 10th birthday. The black wax moves well, but the liquid is so cloudy it is hard to see the wax do its thing. We now have the blue liquid / white wax model, and it works SO MUCH better!"
2,Clear liquid??? You wish!,"Don't be fooled in buying this color lava lamp thinking that you're getting what you're looking for... The liquid in which the black lava floats is extremely cloudy, therefore it's difficult to see the lava's effect and it looks kind of disgusting. I'm disappointed with this product and I hope I'll be able to return it. Maybe trying a different lava lamp color will take care of this. Too bad because I really wished for a black one."
1,unhappy,"i thought i was ordering a 12 pack of this item since that is how it was posted. I received only 1 bottle.i -emailed the seller 3 weeks ago and no response at all!!!!! none whatsoever,I would never have ordered 1 bottle for the price and shipping charge. I requested a refund and return shipping or the remainding 11 bottles and again no response at all !!! Boo to the seller you are misrepresenting the product purchase and you dont even care enough to reply back..... The product itself looks like any other fuel stabilizer so i guess the product is fine. Seller is not good at allAmazon you shoul look into this seller and the posting they have up, makes you look bad. this is the only time i have ever had a complaint about using Amazon over the last 5 years. Buyer beware !!!!"
4,Finally a nice quality release,KILLDOZER isn't the best movie in the world but it is enjoyable in a cheap t.v. movie sort of way. For years this movie was bootlegged and could be purchased at about any film convention but Universal finally found out that these old movies actually have a value and they will sell if released professionally so they started their dvd-r releases as i guess they are probably much cheaper to produce and there is not a problem with over production of a specific title.The quality is very nice and the movie is what it is and that being a fun cheap horror movie made for t.v. in the 1970's.
2,Nice but flawed low budget sci-fi effort with creepy score!!,"Make that three stars.From the same vein as The Car and Duel, Killdozer involves a bulldozer that comes to 'life' and begins to attack the members of a construction crew on a remote pacific island. While the acting and effects were sufficient enough for a film of this type, the director's lack of creativity in building suspense makes it a slow watch but still very worthwhile for fans of Clint Walker or 70's schlock sci-fi.Even at 70 minutes, they were kinda stretching it primarily because of lack of suspenseful scenes or creativity in cinematography. It probably would have been better suited as an episode of The Twilight Zone.A nice find for fans for the sci-fi genre and those who enjoy the creativity required for low budget efforts. Just be sure you see The Car and Duel first, in that order..."
4,"One of the great ""B"" sci-fi movies","Clint Walker in a Sci-Fi ? If you like old ""B"" movies, check this one out. AI from space arrives in meteor and takes up residence in a D9 Cat. Not the Galactic Warship it commanded, but still formidable. I'm glad to see the Vault Series offering these obscure old titles."
3,Not great but still quite enjoyable.,"Beleve it or not, there were a number of good made for tv movies made during the 70's. This was one of them.The idea for the story is a good one. An unknown unseen life-force, alien to our earth. Is accidentaly released from its milleniums of slumber. It starts attacking by entering a bulldozer brought by a constrution crew sent to build some sort of project on a remote island.The rest of the movie is spent with the crew trying to stay alive, while fighting this unseen evil force.This type of plot device,(murderous machines) was popularized by Steven Spielberg's breakthrough tv movie ""Duel"", also made in the 70's.While not a great movie,(only 3 stars). Its still would be a nice addition to any collector's library.Hopefully it will become available on dvd or vhs."
4,Someone start selling this please!,I'm really disappointed that this is currently unavailable in any format. I first saw this movie on TV when I was about 6 years old. At that age it scared me more than vampires. For years afterward I was afraid to walk past construction sites.
5,Awsome,"This is my first hunting game but I must say it is very addictive. You get a choise of hunting white tail, mule, elk, moose, or grizzly. The graphics are great. Thou you only use on in the scenerio you choose there are several guns and two bows. The bears and moose will attack and all animals behave realisticly. You even get tracks and if you hit them blood to follow. I highly recomend this to hunters and game lovers."
4,Coaching a Championship High School Track & Field Team,"Very practical information regarding track and field precedures, workouts and the technicalities of performance for young athletes."
2,"Woah, Man!","Marked Expert Edition, the outrageous techniques demonstrated in The Joint Rolling Handbook are complex and require a bigger attention span than the average stoner has. Even not stoned, the instructions were difficult to understand. If you're looking for practical methods and easy rolling instructions this isn't the book for you. If you already know how to roll joints and have a crafty hand, maybe it is. Most of the convincingly illustrated creations like the windmill and the nose cone require multiple papers, many of which will be cut up for the gummed strip used to ""bandage"" together joints and long tubular roaches until they resemble a smokable jumble of tinker toys quite likely to end up burning a hole in your rug. Intermingled with the individual joint instructions are a few sections offering information on marijuana itself, laws, health risks, etc."
4,Simply singing feelings...,"With ""Melodia sentimental"" opening this album, Zizi Possi overcame all the expectatives of a beautiful interpretation... with not much more than piano and a beautiful voice. Would say the most beautiful and tuning in Brazil.What give us the sensation of hearing something that is sacred; something that only give us pleasure, even when she sings about the pain and bitter existing in fall and lost in love. As it is in ""Guarda um beijo meu"", ""Se meu mundo cair"", ""Explode corao"" other ""Provei"".Everything sounds so harmonic on this album; what is only trying to tell us, that sometimes the greatest things in life are in so many simple things; that things made with pleasure."
5,"Older than dirt, but ...........",".....Yes this book is old, it was written in the 1970's. It was the first Tarantula book I purchased when I got into the hobby. All the pet stores sold it. It gives you all the necessary info you will need to successfully keep a pet Tarantula healthy and happy. I often wonder if Mr. Browning still keeps Tarantulas?"
1,older than dirt!,"I am pretty new to the hobby of tarantulas and I am the type of person that actually enjoys research. I bought this book to add to my library and boy am I sorry I did. This book is soooo old. I know that it says that it's published in 1989 but the pictures are straight from the late 70's (light blue polyester suits,...imagine the movie ""Boogie Nights""). The information is nothing that could not be found on the internet with a google search and if you have been in the hobby of tarantulas you will realize that information is hard to come by and tends to vary and change through the years. I'd have to say pass on this one and buy ""The Tarantula Keepers Guide"" or my favorite ""Tarantulas and other Arachnids."""
4,Very good!,"This is a very good album by the master poet Vinicius, however some of his best and most famous songs are missing from this album. If you want to listen to the cd that does not leave the cd player in my car....get ""Personalidade the best of Brazil""."
5,No Kidding,"Of course ""Modern is only relative"", and I don't know what else anyone should expect from a circa 1932 reprinted book. As if that shouldn't be enough, the editors include a new warning about safety and code compliance. If you want to build modern, I suppose you could buy one of those 'do it yourself' sunset books at the checkstand at home depot. If you would like to see how things were done in the days when cheap, shoddy and uninspired WASN'T the order of the day, this (for stairs anyway) may be your book."
5,A true story that never grows old,"This movie ranks as one of my top favorites. It is so well done, that though I have seen it many times, the suspense still keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I view it. I watch it on a regular basis, each time inviting a family or friend who has never seen it to join me. It's a marvelous supplement to a homeschool history program. The movie provides a real sense of what living behind the iron curtain was like, and shows the high value of the quest for freedom."
3,Night Crossing,I loved this story and wanted to get it on DVD to replace my VHS copy. I found it very dark and almost hard to see the picture. Still a great story but the night scenes were so very dark and hard to see.
1,Does not work in US,This product does not work on my video players. Apparently not made to work in US for some reason. So I do not state anything further in this review except be more aware about what you are buying.
5,A Cold War classic from Disney!,"This is the true story of one of the greatest escapes of the 20th century! The year is 1979. The Strelzyk and Wetzel families desperately want to leave Communist-controlled East Germany so they decide to build a huge hot-air balloon to carry them over to West Germany. Not only is it risky relying on a balloon to carry two families, they also have to avoid East German police. This is a well-crafted Disney film that the whole family will enjoy. The cast includes John Hurt, Jane Alexander, and a then-unknown Beau Bridges. Although I'm very happy to own this on dvd, this is a bare-bones dvd as far as special features go. At least the sound quality is better than my old vhs copy. Still, this is a very important and inspiring story that everyone should know about and I highly recommend this movie to people of all ages."
5,Night Crossing,"I am just soooo grateful and thankful to have found this DVD as we used to watch this with our children and it's a wonderful true story. With much appreciation, Karon"
3,"Shucks! I did not see the ""region 2"" designation in the description :(","Item as described.... however, I did not catch the caveat in the description that this was a ""region 2"" dvd, nor did I notice it on the case. Only when I placed my dvd into my machine did I realize that there was a problem and that I could not play my purchase. I am so bummed. It was supposed to be an awesome family evening, with an incredible movie. What am I to do now?I can only imagine what a wonderful movie it is. I just cannot view it. My bad, I realize. I simply had not had experience enough to know there were even dvd's out there for sale on Amazon which might not be playable on my dvd player. I would prefer not give a ""stars"" rating on this, just a neutral rating because I cannot know about the movie itself. However, since Amazon does not allow for such a rating, I'll give it 3 stars until I get to view it somehow. (Perhaps my geeky son can ""crack"" the code on his computer or such.)"
5,A Guide that Serves Well Beyond the Class,"A wonderful, thorough, inspiring book that teaches as it teacheshow to teach"
3,"The movie, The Leopard, does not measure up to the book.",The book is a wonderful read. The movie is very slow movingand rather dull. It was a great disappointment.
3,Not the best version,"I was extremely disappointed to read that Criterion has chosen to release the 161 minute 1963 version of The Leopard. This version was disavowed by Visconti and was printed by an inferior color process. When I saw it in 1963 I liked it but when I saw the 205 minute ""European"" version almost 20 years later I was overwhelmed. The forty missing minutes added greatly to the story and gave added dimensions to several of the main characters. As to hearing Burt Lancaster's own voice-this is just nonsense. Everybody else is dubbed!!! The 205 minute version does have a dubbed (Italian) voice for Burt but everybody else is speaking Italian. I thought the dubbing for Lancaster was excellent and, given that nothing in life can be exactly as one wants it,the better of two evils. Shame on Criterion for this compromise."
1,Boring and repetitive,"While this movie may be considered a work of art by some, for the most part I found it boring and unecessarily repetitive. The message of the movie is ""plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose."" The more things change, the more they remain the same. That message is relayed in one scene. The rest of the movie can go into the dumper."
1,This is the cut version!,(...)This is the 20 minutes cut version.You may also check IMDB for more proof.
1,The Leopard film is not The Leopard Book,"The Leopard is a dated boreing pretentous film. We stopped watching afterone half an hour. The acting was Bert Lancaster at his worst. He was pompous and dull. There was no excitement whatsoever. I'd say ""forget it""!"
5,Il Gattopardo,"Fantastic is all I can say. This is ""Gone With the Wind"" for Sicily! Burt Lancaster is great and whoever did the voiceover for him was perfect. I actually thought it was Lancaster.Claudia Cardinale, who must have been all of 21 years old, was breathtaking. The slow, deliberate pace of the film was not a flaw; indeed, it was an asset. It permitted me to grasp the flow of life of the place and time.Classic movie and it nails the Sicilian psyche perfectly - the one line says it all about Sicilians: ""Their misery is exceeded only by their vanity!"" I'm Sicilian and I can vouch for that. The other line which is right on is: ""They don't feel a need to change because they think they are perfect."" Wow! Watch it people, over and over.Michele LaTona"
2,Outdated old transfer,"The quite old HD transfer used by Criterion for USA (and BFI for UK) is technically outdated and severely lacking compared to today's standards. Digital sharpening artifacts and electronic noise mar the imagery from start to finish, giving it a processed coarse video look instead of a proper and authentic refined film look. The film has since been restored digitally in 4K and the results are available on far better Blu Rays from France and Italy. There will be a US/UK disc in time. Better wait for this than invest in this problematic Criterion release."
4,Reply to some reviews -The Leopard - Italian full version ??,Take a look at www.bfi.org.uk (official site for the British Film Institute). It appears that they are going to release the uncut Italian version on DVD on 27th September 2004.
5,Sumptuous Rendering,"Excellent film capturing the days before unification of Italy. Such a beautiful epic sprawling with sumptuous scenery, costumes and witty dialogue, but it also was very intimate and immediate, drawing the viewers in as one of the extended family members. Burt Lancaster did an excellent job of capturing the melancholic inevitability of the oncoming sea-change. Do not be put off by the subtitles (one should always watch foreign films with subtitles, not dubbed) or the length - you will be absolutely enthralled with the film and you will hardly notice anything else except the spectacle unfolding on the screen."
4,The Leopard (1963) - Luchino Visconti,"The Leopard is the most subtle epic ever made, and that's really it's true appeal. There is no tradegy, no melodrama, and very little action in it's three hour run time, yet it's a captivating film both beautifully shot and acted. The first hour is a little slow, but once the characters begin to materialize you'll begin to see the films underlying content. Hidden beyond the lush cinematography and incredible production design is an intimate portrait of a stern man accepting the changing times. While not a perfect film, The Leopard remains both an interesting and shining example of how a true character epic should be made."
5,Read The book then watch the movie.,"The book left such a taste of of beauty, and melancholy. The film is perfection. Burt Lancaster is, as always, brilliant in the role."
5,One of Lancaster's best parts,"This story is set in mid-nineteenth century Sicily at the time of Giuseppe Garibaldi's insurrection, when he got Vittorio Emanuelle installed as king and gave the people the plebiscite that established a republican form of government.Lancaster plays a prince (the leopard) who lost power, but maintained his position of respect among the people because he played his part judiciously, accepting change graciously.Not a bloody or violent film, but full of human faults and frailty. The part played by Lancaster holds it all together. He plays his part flawlessly, always in character, and it turns out to be a great movie, well played and interesting.See it if you get the chance. It covers a little known episode in history, and is very entertaining to boot.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"
4,"Yes, it IS a great film, and yet...","There's no question that Il Gatopardo, as the movie is called in Italian, is Italy's answer to ""Gone With the Wind."" That said, this viewer was left hanging at the close of the story. Parts of it are truly brilliant; the acting is powerful; even the dubbing of Lancaster's voice isn't bad. And yet....I came away feeling that something was missing. Ever get that feeling? You can't put your finger on it, but you know something just isn't there. Maybe it needs another viewing...or two...or three...?"
2,Criterion's The Leopard,"I am hoping someone can dispel my worry about this DVD.This title is already available in Italy from www.dvd.it as a Region 2 disk, with a running time of 180 minutes. Its original title is IL GATTOPARDO.Is Criterion releasing the full version?Don't forget: Paramount never released the full-length version of Bertolucci's 1900."
5,Atlast a truthful commentary.,"It is a worth seeing this DVD! Dr. Huston Smith must have made a real quest for 'a True India'- ""It's soul to be caught nowhere but its land as distant as nearby travel agent"". His quest never ending because his quest for the infinite! The comment on the cover - ""the soul of a people"" is more than appealing to me."
5,Go On,fantastic album. moved away from the catchy pop songs to more meaningful lyrics. great songs . recommended for Mr Mister fans
2,Repetitive and overhyped,"I buy cookbooks as much for the reading material as for the recipes, but in this case, reading carefully brings out the worst in the book. Willinger seems to have keyed her computer to spit out the same few sentences every time she mentions Tuscany ( a lot) or a certain Torquato (the man she buys vegetables from, so he also rates many mentions) or the almanac from which she gets much of her historical information. The recipes, too, disappoint. Many of them are the sort of thing you'd come up with on your own such as sauteeing a given vegetable in parsley, garlic, and olive oil. All in all, this is one of the most disappointing cookbook purchases I have made in a long time. The glowing reviews, of course, contributed to my sense of disappointed expectations, leading me to conclude that the world of cookbook publishing runs on the same hype that fuels potboilers."
4,A Great Resource For The Italian Cook,"While living in Italy, I learned to appreciate the Italian way of cooking vegetables which combined fresh ingredients with simple preparations, creating amazing results, and Faith Willinger's book on Italian vegetables is packed full of these types of recipes. As the host of my own Italian cuisine website Italian Food Forever, I love to prepare vegetables in the Italian manner, and this book has become a great resource for me. Each chapter highlights a vegetable, with a little history of each thrown in with great recipes. If you like vegetables, you'll enjoy this book."
5,Amazing,"Amazing for my delicate, fine, dehydrated natural hair. I would definitely recommend. Makes hair soft, shiny and strong. best product I've ever used."
2,Disappointing,"I know this is a natural product, but it smelled as if it was past its date. I had to use alot to get any kind of moisturizing. I prefer the Hydrating Hair Mask over this one."
5,Finely crafted fantasy,"A finely crafted fantasy about a time-traveling Genie, from a thousand years ago, who meets up with his first female Master. A special bond forms between Genie, Ben, and Master, Maddie. He lives in a bottle, and takes her on magic carpet rides, up into the starry skies, experiencing the desert life of ancient Persia. Ben manifests at a low point in Maddie's life, and makes her feel cared for.This is a treasure of a tale, imaginative and supernatural. Read all 340 plus pages in one day. Could not put this book down. Might a screenplay adaptation be in the works? What a wonderful movie it would make, with all the visual special effects.Judi McCoy is a master at weaving a story filled with wonder and imagery. She is a talented and prolific writer.Arlene Millmanauthor of ""Boomerang - A Miracle Trilogy"" and""Forever Love and More, Encore"""
3,Give This A Miss,"I read Judi McCoy's second book, You're The One, before reading this. For some reason, I just didn't enjoy this book as I did the second one.Maybe it's because the book constantly portrayed Ben as a kind of helpless guy since he is a genie and has to obey commands. Everytime his past was mentioned, he is so extremely ashamed although none of it was his fault. And when he was finally freed of the curse, his genie bottle `spit' him out in a cave. He walked out of a cave and found himself in a warzone in the Middle East? What is that all about?So then he took a month to get back to Maddie, who in the meantime met up with Aladdin and his dying genie to help her find Ben. Corny? Wait till you read what happens after that. I don't think I will go on any further.Anyway, my advice? Give this a miss. Head for Judi McCoy's second book - You're The One."
4,I dream of you,"I like this book, it has a very good plot to it with suspend and mystery. But the female character is really boring, lame with no imagination and no spunk to her. Reading it can't help but thinking she is overweight, too real...(the female character). It is not as funny as you want it to be but it is fast pace and make a good bedtime reading."
3,"Some good, some bad","Actually 3.5 stars. Some enjoyable tracks from a technically good guitarist and reasonable singer who unfortunately fails to generate the excitement I expect from good blues on most of the tracks. The standout track is 'Dead sea'. The other exceptions are T.L.C. and city of angels (somewhat). ""I'll get to heaven on my own"" is a good acoutic track which shows his capabilities but is spoilt by the arrogance of the lyrics. The lowlight is the accordion on ""ain't nothing' goin' on""."
4,"4,5 stars - A very good album",Most of the songs are great and A tale that wasn't right is an amazing ballad -> one of my top 5 overall. I suggest this album to all metal fans. Buy this album you will like it
3,Masks And Stars,"""Keeper of the Seven Keys part I"" was the first famous Helloween album. Michael Kiske was in vocals instead of Kai Hansen who was the vocalist during the Mini-LP and ""Walls of Jericho"". Kiske has much better voice...he can sing much higher. After the intro start two quite simle songs ""I'm Alive"" and ""A Little Time""...but then start the great queque of great songs: ""Twilight of the Gods"", the peaceful ballad ""A Tale That Wasn't Right"", ""Future World"", the long epic song ""Halloween"". I like so much the song ""Halloween"". The lyrics are very good: ""Masquerade, masquerade, grab your mask and don't be late...there's magic in the air..."". The superstitious things have been captured in that song. The song lasts over 13 minutes. The last song is an outro ""Follow the Sign"". It is a speech I would say.Stars: Halloween, Future World, A Tale That Wasn't Right"
3,Energetic and solid.,"Helloween is a good German band. Keeper of the Seven Keys-Part 1 is a tight and satisfying piece of music. The album's musical direction is hard rock with a metallic and melodic edge. There's a total of eight tracks, and all of them are listenable and solid. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight. There are some cool guitar riffs and solos throughout. Michael Kiske's vocals are operatic and effective. Some of the tracks that I like are ""Future World,"" ""Halloween,"" and ""A Tale That Wasn't Right."" ""Halloween"" is a cool tune that's over thirteen minutes in length, and ""A Tale That Wasn't Right"" is a nice power ballad. The lyrics to some of the songs are also interesting. This album is cool and worth a listen."
5,A Must Buy,"If you like melodic heavy metal, then this is a must buy. Be careful when buying their other albums though, Helloween is one the most interesting groups I have ever seen as they have completely changed their style so many times. For instance, their previous album ""Walls of Jericho"" is a complete junk with trash noise. Keeper 1 and 2 are the best traces that Helloween has put on heavy metal. Buy this one and the second one."
4,Keeper Part 1 is a Definite Keeper,"On of the greatest albums of from this band, Keeper 1 ranks up there with it's follow up album, Keeper Part 2. The gutiar and vocal work are terrific. The band seem to be in good form musically. Tracks like Halloween and Future World are Great examples of what a power metal song should sound like. A little time is another great for this CD. I fully believe no Power Metal collection is complete without Keeper of the Seven Keys part 1."
3,Worth A Listen,"This in not a half bad album. There's some pretty good material here; especially the great song ""Halloween,"" and ""Future World."" I don't like it as much as I do KOTSK Part II, but it's still worth the price."
4,Almost Great,"This one stands out for many reasons: great songs like: future world or twilight of the gods, great guitarts (thanks to Kai Hansen and Michael Weikath), great new metal sound and the amazing sound of Michael Kiske voice. The only thing I can't handle yet is the Charlie Brown mention on Halloween's track. Otherwise, would be GREAT!"
2,Music for 14 year olds,"Especially on the US market, Helloween is best known for the kind of childish, clownesque heavy metal that they started making from this album onwards. Listening to this, it is hard to imagine that this band previously recorded a classic speed metal album called ""Walls of Jericho""."
1,Overrated Dio knockoffs,"Lets put it this way, would you rather eat a greasy Big Mac, or a filet mignon? Thats how people should feel when deciding this over Iron Maiden.Screw this garbage, listen to Blind Guardian instead. They make this band look like N' Sync with guitars.P.S Props to Snively"
4,A nice surprise.,"I needed a couple of more items to ""bulk out"" a recent order, and I'd heard the name ""Helloween"" a few times in the past, and it sorta stuck in my head. On a whim, I picked up the two ""Keeper"" albums, and was blown away. Good guitar riffs, good song writing, and the awesome vocals of Micheal Kiske conspire to make this a must have!In the couple of weeks since I received these cds, I have become a big fan of Helloween, picking up ""Master of the Rings"" and ""Time of the Oath"", and have ordered ""Better than Raw"" and ""Dark Ride"". Helloween's a fun, melodic band, and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys metal music."
4,A great CD that helped start the Power Metal revolution,"Basically what I said above is my review. However, I was reading the Amazon review, which says there was never a sequel. You guys need to do your research!!! There was a part two, and it equaled the first. I hope I'm not the first Helloween fan to point this out, and I hope I won't be the last either."
2,"Amusing Italian Sex Comedy, But Very Poor Quality Unrestored DVD","This is a mildly amusing Italian farce, best known today for the scene showing Sophia Loren taking a nude swim (this clip is all over the Internet). However, the quality of this DVD is really disgraceful. It has not been restored at all, so colors are badly faded and there is dirt everywhere. Furthermore, the DVD is dubbed in English, rather than being available in Italian with English language subtitles.Hopefully some day a properly restored DVD in Italian with subtitles will be available."
4,Didn't order in pink!,"Ordered this for my 18 mos old GRANDSON, thought it was so cute in the GREEN color they advertise!~But it came in a very cute bright purple/pink..so really cute for girls, but i was just upset because not what was advertised!!I got it for a great price & of course he dosen't care about the color..i was just painting his room in cool green colors where the table would be, so it looks out of place with everything else, lol...oh well..great deal for price otherwise.Things i like are the pictures & nice bright colors, plus table & chairs fold for easy storage...BUT, watch out for fingers being pinched if your kids decide to try to fold table.chairs.The other thing i don't care for is the table & chair LEGS are METAL, BUT, the top of the table & chairs are a SOFT PLASTIC...so they will rip very easy/tear if your kids use a scissors or poke with a pen!"
2,A Lot of Hype,"A great disappointment. Fabulous food photography but the recipes are just more complicated remakes of ""been around"" recipes. I should have saved my money.I'm somewhat of a food professional and none of the recipes I've made from the book were worth making again. Several didn't come out anything like the picture and weren't nearly as good as the original versions."
5,Delicious :-(),"This is a great cookbook. There are some very enticing things to make here. The photography is amazing and makes it all seem so delicious. I'm just hoping that my copies look this good. I've tried two things already with not bad results. The only problem I have with a book like this (all cookbooks), is that sometimes some recipes are tricky. So far I haven't come across an obstacle, but I have in every other cookbook so I hope this is a little different. I can't wait till Pesach next year to try a few items out. I'm sure no one is going to go hungry with this."
2,love her books,i have tried many of the recipes from this book and they have all been excellent. I have given all of her books as presents to friends and they love them as well.
5,WOW!!! This cookbook is over-the-top!,"This cookbook provides everything we have come to expect from one of Susie Fishbein's creations, and then some. The pictures are beautiful, the recipes are unique and straight-forward, and the results are fantastic. The 'pastrami stuffed turkey roast with pineapple glaze' has already become a family favorite! I had to pry the cookbook out of my husband's hands when I first brought it home - he was reading it like a beloved novel. I especially appreciate the resource guide - it is so helpful and really makes the book user-friendly. Thanks Susie - can't wait for the next one!"
4,Worth every penney!,"Photographs are beautiful, receipes are easy to follow, uncommon and uncomplicated. Unusual ingredients are listed in the back with stores from which to purchase. Entertainment ideas are interesting and not the ""same old thing"". All in all, this is a great buy. Well done!"
3,Good collection,"My favourites are Java, I'm Movin' On and Girl from Ipanema. There are some other nice ones not included such as Pink Confetti, Cotton Candy etc. but overall a good album to ""test the waters""."
5,Stage Makeup Step-By-Step Guide,This is a very useful tool for stage makeup. It has made my life much easier. I'm more than happy that this book is available.
3,Stage Makeup Step by Step,"Although there are some really good techniques in this book, I thought the regular stage makeup was a bit bland looking."
4,Good quick reference source,"Although I'm only somewhat enthusiastic about this title, my high school theatre students are VERY enthusiastic about it -- and so I'll amend my previous review by saying that the book has excellent photos that provide good, basic guidelines. My students enjoy opening the book to the instructions of their choice and following them (as the title states) step by step. As I happen to be the school librarian as well as the theatre director, I've added this title to our library's collection in order to make it readily available for reference. Yes, this title belongs in every high school library, and colleges and universities would do well to consider it."
1,How to surf fish? Not from this DVD,"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD and subsequently returned it. One would hope that an instructional DVD would cover topics such as how to surf cast which is more difficult to learn from a book that can only present a sequence of photographs. Instead the information covered is actually better presented in Burnley's ""Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast"". Information on how to identify good fishing spots and the equipment to use doesn't require a video format for effective presentation. The only action in the DVD are scenes of good ol' boys fishing the Carolina Coast--it was more of a travelogue from the fifties than an instructional video. Save your money."
3,needs a lot of editing,"I received this book last week, and was really excited to read it. It is chock full of interesting recipes and snippets of Brown Derby trivia, but who ever type-set the book needs to be fired. I have found way over a dozen mispelled words, and I think a lot of words were just plain left out. Some of the stories seem to have little plot-holes.In general, it's an interesting read, if you enjoy reading cookbooks. (I do.) The recipes, however, are very intricate, complicated, and seem to be full of saturated fats. Lots of butter and cream, and the use of organ meats.If you are interested in Golden Movie age trivia, however, and like to cook, this is the book for you.,"
4,Loads of memories.... but,"I loved this CD. It brought back some great memories of childhood. However, I could have done without the Trini Lopez covers... I never heard them before I got this CD."
2,folk song cd,i was disappointed in the chose of music on this cd. most of the songs were not the ones that were chart toppers in the 1950-60's- the choice was limited.
2,"Mediocre collection, at best",Too many songs to skip over but my mistake in wasting money for an addition to folk music CDs that I'll donate to the next solicitor.
5,The man in the iron mask movie,"I saw this movie on T.V. I have watched it numerous times.I liked it so much I ordered it. Now I can watch it any time I want. It is a fantastic, interesting movie"
4,great entertainment,"I do agree that the tone of this film falls a little short of capturing that Old World romanticism that when done just right can sweep you off your feet and give you a sense of really being there. And the harsh and twangy lack of high society in Leo DiCaprio's voice does irritate the crap outta me.But the supporting four give captivating performances, and I think the intrigue and mystery with which Byrns and Irons' characters are woven into the story makes it that much more thoughtful and interesting, and keeps the traditional action and romance from dominating the story."
2,Mediocre...,"How on Earth can such a cast: Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu make such a bad movie from such a great story and such a classic novel? Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the worst things to ever happen to American films and deservedly so. He's ruined many a good movie that he has painfully performed in. And after such a stellar film as Braveheart, Randall Wallace could have done better justice in adapting Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of adventure, betrayal and ultimate redemption. It's not all bad, but it certainly isn't all good, or even half good for that matter. It's entertaining, but not the best big screen version of the movie there is. Entertaining, but just not quality."
3,Mask in the Iron Mask,It was OK I am not reccomending it to friends. I love the author but the acting was only fair
3,It was fine,"Ordered this off of Amazon on Demand. Uploaded fine. Daughter had to watch this movie for a class project. A bit spendy for this old of a movie, but I had to do what I had to do for my girl."
1,Brilliant novel + Hollywood = loser,"Dumas' novel is one of the great works of western fiction. The massive distortions of the original story in this movie do not serve any purpose other than to create a Hollywood ending. Athos played as grumpy and poor by John Malkovich? This has got to be one of the strangest mis-casting decisions of all time! D'Artagnan as the king's father! These are really bizarre choices that are unnecessary. I can see Hollywood massively rewriting a story that is half-baked, but why trash one of the greatest stories of all time? Do we really need every story to have an impossible series of coincidences and end with a smiley face? This adaptation is an insult to viewers brought to us by people too lazy and condescending to care about quality. Waste of a great book and a great cast. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Leo just couldn't complete with the other 4,"People are going on about Leo's back acting. It wasn't that great to be sure, especially with the lack of appropriate accent. But stacking him next to 4 amazing veteran actors is what made him seem horribly bad. Leo wasn't too bad in Titanic, but he just can't compete with Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, John Malkovich or Gerard Depardieu... not even close.The movie is flawed and two dimensional, but it's still enjoyable as long as you're watching it for one of the older and better four and not DiCaprio.Also check the French movie ""Revenge of the Musketeer."" Really good."
5,Spectacular!! A brilliant masterpiece!!,"I'll admit: I'm not a DiCaprio fan, but Leo did a superb job in this film. John Malkovich's performance was very inspiring. I think this film should have received the Oscar for Best Costumes!"
4,"All for one, One for all..an excellent summary of living","I will not impress with vocabulary, or spelling, or deny finding Dicaprio easy to watch. It is a movie full of heroes. I was reared on heroes, those who had courage to stand against odds and the majority. It is difficult to find that today. The slow motion of the prison charge, the murmured ""Magnificent Valor"" brought delicious chills to me, and misty eyes to my daughter. If you want the classics, read the books. An art not practiced currently.I have read the book long before Leonardo,and contary to opinion it was not swashbuckling nor exhilarating. It was prose with poetic phrasing. I found the movie a delight. It is hard to find heroes without dark undertints at present. It is refreshing when you do."
2,An ambitious forgettable film forgotten like the true Man in the Iron Mask,Call me sentimental but I far more enjoyed Richard Chamberlain's Man in the Iron Mask from the 70s as it had more style and less big budget hokeyness.This film is another forgettable 90s big budget piece that tried to be more than it was. All the heart stirring and melodramatics might have worked on the teeny bopper crowd but it raised groans from older audience members. There was too much heart-pulling hokeyness to the whole thing - the charge against the muskets for example which ended dramatically lifeless since no one died. The one who did die in the movie didn't die in the book.I don't want to hate on DiCaprio as he is an easy target but his portrayal of young Louis XIV was terrible. He did a better Phillipe because he had to be more subdued.I think the film took itself too seriously and as a result it became a rather soppy melodramatic affair with shallow roots.
1,"bad acting, bad script, terrible movie","This is an unsophisticated, badly written, terribly acted movie that just doesn't work. I can't imagine what the reviewers who like it were thinking. DiCaprio is ghastly. None of the actors can read any of the lines convincingly. The damsel in distress has the most childish, silly voice.... Awful movie."
2,Oh please!,"Now, girls, be honest, I know 98% percent of you saw this movie simply to see Leonardo DiCaprio. I actually read the book before I saw the movie, and the movie doesn't even deserve the same title. The movie totally departs for what is a magnificent book, and twists it all around in to this sex story that I found totally unappealing. And DiCaprio? Can there be a worse man for the part? And the blonde girl he falls in love with ( I think her name is Christine) I challange you to find me someone who is a worse actress than her. Plus, she obviously had the brain mass of a drunken parrot. And that doesn't even begin to pick at the whole love affair between the Queen and D'Artangan (pardon my spelling)that absolutely sickened and appalled me."
2,DiCaprio's a good actor but not the for this part-not believable,"Leonard DiCaprio carries off his role in Aviator with aplomb. As for his role in the Man in the Iron Mask he's a bomb.A King of France with an almost squeaky voice? Shouldn't have accepted the script Leonard, you did better as ""The Kid"" in""The Quick and the Dead"" and that wasn't completely believable, but then neither were Hackman, or Stone, both too over blown.Back to ""Iron Mask"" the whole thing seem too contrived. Russell Crowe, the Preacher who swore off killing gunning down his opponents, for Pete's sake take the bullet Russell you'll still get paid.The Iron Mask needed somebody who could be suave and nasty as all get out, and young sir, you didn't have the chops for either of those qualities at the age you were when you made that film. Daniel Day Lewis, Alec Baldwin, or Tim Roth are names that pop into my mind who could be nasty and suave, that is to say perfidious enough to carry off the role.Old Timer"
1,A Disgrace to a Classic Novel,This version of The Man in the Iron Mask is terrible. I had heard several very highly rated reccommendations for the movie and I was bitterly disappointed. From the very beginning I was bored completely. Leo fans are the only ones I can see being interested in this film. Definately NOT on my wish list!
2,Much ado about nothing,"This is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is disappointing for several reasons. One it does not do justice to the excellent writing of Dumas. Two, the directing is poor, managing to elicit less than spectacular acting from Malkovich, Irons or Depardieu. Three the sword fighting is poor. Fourth the movie drags on without inspiring any particular interest in the supposed heros (except for the scene where Athos goes to revenge his son's death). If you can rent this movie it might be worth an evenings watch. I wouldn't bother buying it."
3,Hollywood Big Budget,"Its amazing people think this was ""amazing"". I guess standards have really been lowered nowadays. I don't understand Di Caprio's appeal. Honestly, he looked like a girl in this movie. Which is great if you like boy's who look like girls. I think Depardieu is more appealing. Gabriel Byrne was the most convincing and entertaining actor. The little mustache worked for me. If you want lighthearted entertainment and have a few laughs even when its not supposed to be funny, you'll like this one."
4,good job,well buy form them. i playing wich dvd. that do there job on time. play games on ps3 to wich
4,THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"WHEN I RENTED THIS VIDEO I DIDN'T EXPECT TO WATCH IT FIVE TIMES (EVERY DAY) BEFORE I RETURNED IT. NOW, I'M IN THE MARKET OF PURCHASING THIS FOR MY COLLECTION. YES, I CAN STILL WATCH THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN. IRONICALLY, IT WAS NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER (TITANIC BOY) WHO WAS THE BAIT BUT THE STORY LINE AND ITS CHARACTERS. LEO WAS GREAT IN THE TITANIC BUT HE WAS NOT THE REASON FOR WANTING TO OWN THIS VIDEO!"
3,"BRIEF COMMENT, AND SOME TRIVIA","The plusses and minuses in the movie have been covered by other reviewers, so I will only add two comments and some trivia: First, Gerard Depadieu is a real hoot, though I wonder why he looks skinnier here than he did in ""Cyrano"". Second, this is one of those movies that deserves wide-screen treatment, and I was disappointed that I could not find a wide-screen videotape. I mean, who wants to watch the two-and-a-half musketeers charging?Trivia: This older Athos is played by John Malkavich, a role that was played by Jose Ferrer in ""The Fifth Musketeer."" Malkavich has since played another character previously played by Ferrer in a French-Historical movie: In ""The Messenger: the Story of Joan of Arc"" Malkavich plays the Dauphin, a role previously played by Ferrer in ""Joan of Arc"" with Ingrid Bergman."
3,A decent drama,"This is by no means historically accurate but as a movie, it works. The actors all do a fine job portaying the famous characters, especially Gabriel Byrne. But really, with the cast that includes John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Leonardo Dicaprio, you really can't go wrong. I thought it was a tad long, but didn't really drag. Also, it doesn't really follow the historic novel, from what I can recall, so if you are looking for accuracy, look somewhere else. Otherwise, you can be entertained by it as is."
3,Leo's done better,"As a DiCaprio fan, I've seen all of the films he was in. Although the story line was good, I thought that DiCaprio's acting wasn't that great. Sure, he was capable of playing the nice version of the twin, but when it came to the villain part, (baby faced Leo) wasn't that convincing. If you are a DiCaprio fan, because of his acting skills, movies such as the ""Basketball Diaries"" or ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" are the ones to watch."
3,mediocre,"I agree that it is a beautiful movie with expensive decorations and stuff and the musketeers are great. However the plot is very weak and it seems that the movie creators read the book in their teens and did not go back to it before making the movie. Who in the world could think of making D'Artagnian the king's father? Only people who never knew what French roalty looked liked in the 17th century... Besides, Leo Di Caprio is not talented enough to play a real great king as Louis XIV was. Moreover, the love story of Louise de la Valliere and the king deserves more attention because it has been an inspiration for creating Versailles - the most magnificent palace in the world. I highly recommend to read the book series in order to understand what the musketeers and the king were all about."
5,Supporting Actors set off movie and Leonardo.,"The movie ""The Man In The Iron Mask"" is one of the best movies of 1997 and 1998.Leonardo set the stage as the evil ruler and then Leonardo set the stage as the hero. Although the movie concentrated on the King the supporting actor Gabriel Byrne really made the movie the hit that it is."
4,A nice movie with the wrong leading actor,This is a really nice movie ... but Leo just doesn't fit as this king. I like Leo as an actor (and of course I think he's cute) but .. I just didn't think he was a believable french king ... sorry! And the end .. it was a little too much ... too big of a cliche
1,I Kept Wanting It To Be Wonderful!,"With all that talent how could it go so wrong! Mr Malcovich seemed only to want it over with so he could get away. DeCaprio was lost and in desperate need of direction. The others tried, but there was no saving this movie. It was scenically beautiful, packed with talent, and a total waste of time. I recently watched a silent version of this story which held me as this group of fine talent should have been able to, but could not. This film just makes me sad for what it could have been."
3,Good rainy day movie,"I thought this movie was entertaining. Although it was a bit predictable.......ok, it was VERY predictable, it was still exciting to watch. I am not a big Leonardo Dicaprio fan, but this was fun to watch. John Malkovich was great in this movie, but he's great in every movie. This is a good Saturday afternoon couch movie."
2,A Major Dissappoinment,"Leonald Maltin is the film critic I respect the most, but this time I must disagree: this version is lame. Gerard Depardieu is the only thing that makes it worth a look."
2,The Original is Better!,I didn't think movie was great at all! I don't like Leo either. I think the movie dragged on too long. There were some immpressive actors in this movie though..but I still give it a bad review. It is better to see the Original first.
1,Man In The Comic Mask,"I must not have watched the same movie that others have. I found the movie laughable. Bad dialog, bad acting, and just plain silly. I have seen other versions of this story that are far better than this one. I have never thought much of DiCillio's acting abilities, and this movie only reinforces that opinion. Just awful. Waste of time."
4,The Man In The Iron Mask,The Man in the Iron Mask is a wonderful action movie. Yet some parts were very unnecessary but the acting was great accept for the fact that they could not pronounce french names. I thought that they could handle the drama very well. I could sit there crying for a 1/2 hour afterwards. A very well put together movie.
1,Wretched performance - No redeeming value,"I have to say this is the biggest letdown I have had in the past 10 years. L. DiCaprio is pathetic. The other actors are sleep walking through the entire thing, probably regretting the fact that they were ever involved and wanting to end their self-induced torture as quickly as possible.If you are brain damaged or a 14 year old acne faced female in love with L. DiCaprio you will enjoy this film. If you have enjoyed previous adaptations of Alexander Dumas' Musketeer stories or can recognize bad acting then you will be looking for a garbage can to throw up in (Better get a bucket!). If you paid money and saw this in the theatre without violently demanding a refund afterwards, I admire your Olympian self-restraint."
3,"OK Story, but...","I like this show and all, but every time John Malkovich has a line I cringe. I don't know who cast him for this role. He can't act. I would laugh as he talks, but I really want to like the movie."
4,Loved it,"I loved this movie, I loved the action, intrique, romance and comedy. I loved Gabriel Byrne in it, he did a great job. I would defintly recommend this movie to my friends."
3,mediocre,"The movive is good and well-done but the plot is weak: who could think of making D'Artagnian the king's father? Do they really know what French roalty used to be? Besides, the story with faked Christine looked kind of out of place. Why not to put the beautiful Louise de La Valliere forward to make is look more real? Moreover, the leading actor as it has been mentioned before has nothing to do with a real Freanch king such as Louis XIV. The book is much better and I recommend to read it to compare."
5,This has got to be the greatest movie of all time,"Special note for the viewer from new zealand: He was Louie the fourteenth, not Louie the third.I love this movie. It is by far Leo DiCaprio's best movie. I saw Titanic and What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Marvin's Room, all wonderfully done, but they just can't compare to this.In case any of you are airheads who think all twelve year old girls have their heads on backwards and love Leo DiCaprio are reading this, I'm setting the record straight. I can be a fan of his and not think he's 'adorable'. Any number of adult DiCaprio fans will agree with me, my dad included.But it is the best movie I think I've ever seen. I wish I owned it. Unfortunatly, I don't. But I might soon if I can't stand not seeing it a few more times. Anyway, the bottom line is, see this movie and cry over it, then reccomend it to a friend."
1,"LOVE the Book, HATE the Movie","If you love the book, don't torture yourself by watching this movie. It is obvious that the Hollywood has stopped reading the book, and started writing scripts from the title of the book. This movie betrays everything about the four noble musketeers, and used their names to sell a movie to their fans. There's absolutely nothing salvageable about this movie. Even the background design looks terrible. Who ever was the make-up artist for this movie should be banned from any future job. After being in stuck in prison for most of his life with a mask on his face, the prince had perfect set of white teeth and nothing hideous on his face other than overgrown hair. This movie is terrible from beginning to end."
4,4.5 stars,"People are trashing this movie mainly because of Leo, who was -- admittedly -- miscast. The role should probably have gone to someone with some talent. But apart from that and the dialogue, the movie is worth almost five stars just for Gabriel Byrne's acting, which is -- as always -- breathtaking. He is superb and shows all the nuances of his character's ethical dilemma. As for the historical inaccuracy, the movie wouldn't be faithful to Dumas's novel if it didn't completely rewrite history. Dumas himself is notorious for that. As for not following Dumas's plot, that's because the novel was jumbled and uninteresting and had the worst ending possible to a story. In the movie, we get to see the Musketeers together for one last stand -- and in spite of the cliches that everyone else comments on, it's actually really cool."
3,A Very Good Movie Spoiled by One Miscast!,"An otherwise excellent movie spoiled by one miscast. Good story, good adaptation and good acting but DiCaprio is just NOT The Type to play the role of Louis XIV, not to mention his frequent mispronunciation of the names of the major characters. What a shame!"
3,Better than I thought it would be...,"The ONLY reason I rented this film was because of John Malkovich (who was, as always, awesome). I was not expecting much since I can't stand Leonardo DiCaprio. But despite DiCaprio (who was horribly miscast and embarrassingly bad), I was quite entertained.(The casting of DiCaprio in TMITIM ranks right down there at the bottom with Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Bad, bad, bad.)"
2,Why does everyone love this movie?,"I don't understand the appeal of this film.I cringed through the entire thing. Leonardo disappoints me more and more, the more I see him act. He was terrible in ""Titanic."" It is unfortunate how stardome has influenced his judgment choosing his films since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" which was phenomenal. John Malchovick's performance was also a gargantuan let-down. He was desperately unconvincing as a loving father (he looked too young to be a father of a marraigable man, first of all) and his acting was so terrible you could have driven a semi through his lines. Leo was equally transparent in his character development, not to mention, completely unappealing physically. Get the boy a comb."
1,Wretched!,"I can only surmise what people were thinking when giving high marks to this movie--controlled substance abuse and chemical dependency come to mind as excuses--but I can see it earning nothing more than 1 star. The acting was horrible, the plot thin (I suppose it vaguely resembles Alexandre Dumas' novel), and the sets third rate. What we have here is the avaricious hollywood establishment banking the success of a movie on a star whose acting skills barely rise above high school drama class. The end product is a shoddy movie that the studios have foisted on us in the hopes that minions of 13-17 year old girls will shell out $$$ to watch this movie over and over and over again. The success of this movie will only encourage more hollywood schlock I fear. Read the book."
2,WAY too much!!!,"This movie is mediocre at best - 3 stars would be mildly generous. However, subtract a star for the price point. Almost $25 for a movie this mediocre and this OLD! This is not a classic, it was a so-so movie from years ago, and doesn't deserve a price point higher than most current just-released movies!"
2,"Gorgeous Film, but too Ambitious","The film dives into too many characters and winds up distracting from the main plot. It's over 2 hours long and will feel that way when you watch it. Not enough time was spent on the 2 main characters (Phillipe and his twin), so you feel deprived when it's over. Way too many scenes showing the sexuual trysts of one of the Musketeers, played by G√©rard Depardieou. He is shown doing a threesome, a twosome, a onesome (O.K we get it, the ladies dig him). The settings and the costumes are gorgeous. With a Better screenplay , this could have been a great film. Needed more Leonardo time and less Gerard."
5,The Man in the Iron Mask,This was a very good movie with an all star cast. It is well worth watching again and again.
2,What's the big deal about Leo?,"My friends (die-hard Leo fans) dragged me to see this movie in the theatre. I'm not much of a musketeer fan, but I found this movie mildly entertaining. To be honest, I think that had this movie not featured the ""lovely Leonardo"", it wouldn't have lasted more than a week in the theatres. If you like watching a bunch of men in strange costumes riding around on horses, you'll love it. Otherwise, give it a pass."
1,"This Movie Should be Kept in an Iron Box, Far Away","You know, I for one liked Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Titanic"", so I wanted to see what he would be like in this movie, a version of which I had seen years ago with the king of the miniseries, Richard Chamberlain. Lous XIV's twin brother has been kept all these years as a prisoner in a remote place, with an iron mask covering his famous features so that no one will know his true identity. People who are tired of the mean king they've been having all this time now want to take a chance on this new guy, and train him to impersonate the King. Wow, what do you think is going to happen next?Mon Dieu! Quel bad movie!LDiC is absolutely AWFUL. There's just no getting around it. Please see Mr. Chamberlain's take on it, and relegate this to the salvage dump."
1,Leonardo stinks,"Great Film, with one exception. Leonardo Dicaprio. Whats worse, in this film there is two of him!!!! UUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!"
2,Nowhere near ........................,"This film is interesting at first but then if begins to sag like a souffle. Leonardo is just too cute to be Louis IV. He made the king look like he was twelve. The movie is not interesting in the sense that it doesn't show Louis's character in detail or Phillipe's. It had little action as well. The French mustv'e laughed at this film. Leo looks nowhere near the real king! It's amazing how a director hires ""a popular actor"" to make some quick kaching$$. Now the costumes are wonderful and the scenery as well but even this could not save this film."
4,Yoga bolster,I purchased the hugger mugger yoga bolster for a restorative yoga training. I was very happy with the quality of the bolster. It was a good size and provided firm support in the postures. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a restorative yoga experience.
3,Bolster is a little big,I like the bolster. It's well made and serves it's yoga use well; but I wanted a bolster to put under my knees while sleeping to ease my back. This bolster is too big for that. Otherwise it's very good buy.
2,Built well,"Very supportive almost to an extreme. I seldom use it because of its firmness. Do like the shape though, would not buy again"
1,cover not washable,"I bought this bolster and as soon as I purchased it I washed the cover on delicate, in cold water and hung it to dry. Once it dried, I was not able to fit the cover back over the bolster. The customer service rep told me I should have dry cleaned it. For a Yoga product, and a natural, washable fabric such as cotton, I find this completely ludicrous. Washing in water is nontoxic, inexpensive and natural. Dry cleaning is expensive, uses chemicals and is toxic. I have many couch and chair cushiions that I wash regularly. Being able to easily clean a product such as this is important. The company should prewash the fabric before constructing the covers so that they dont' shrink. The label says cold water wash is ok, but it's not. There isn't any reason that the cover shouldn't be washable. I would not buy this product again and wasted $60."
4,Funky show,"When I first saw the trailer, I was sure this show was going to suck, especially with the art style. However, when I caught one episode, I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was, and how much I came to enjoy it. It certainly is better than some of Cartoon Network's other shows, and even though the art style still bothers me sometimes, it is more than made up for in storyline and dialogue. 4.5/5 stars.Be forewarned though, this particular product is not a season set or anything like that. Best to wait until a complete boxed season set comes out before actually buying unless you simply cannot wait to have some of the episodes on DVD."
5,"Clever ,great looking show,","This show is great. The characters are all entertaining. A boy named Finn lives with his buddy Jake a dog(John DiMaggio!) who has stretchy powers. They have a lot of adventures and fun with Bubblegum Princess & fight off the evil Ice King(voiced by Tom Kenny!!).There is also a song writing vampire who steals their house but later becomes pals with Finn,She eats the color red. There are a lot of cute & hilarious little characters like Lady Rainicorn,(a rainbow unicorn who sometimes speaks korean)Bemo(like an atari but adorable and alive),LSP(A valley girl space alien princess),Cinnamon Bun,Starchy,ZOMBIE CANDY!!!!,Vikings,lots of cute various princesses.Paul Rubben voices an evil gnome for an episode, there are lots of recurring story lines and great new words for you to learn like ""ALGEBRAIC!"" & ""wHAT THE MATH?"".This show was just what I needed after my soul got crushed with Flapjack getting axed from cartoon network. Buy this show. You need it. It is worth it."
1,Ripped off other cartoons,Do not buy this garbage its a rip off of where the wild things are and the marvelous adventures of flapjack. It will make you kids dumber.
3,"I love AT, but this isn't what I expected...","I preordered this DVD when I saw a promotional post on the Frederator tumblr, since it's sales would apparently influence future Adventure Time releases. Already being a fan of the show, I ordered it hoping to eventually get the full series on DVD (perhaps even a boxed set). Jump ahead a few weeks to it's release date, I actually looked closer at the product description, I noticed it was really just a collection of random episodes, and I was sorely disappointed, but decided to buy it anyway for the awesome cover art. When it was finally delivered, I eagerly opened the shipping package to find a cheaply package with shrink-wrap melted directly to the case and what look like bite marks on the edges. The cover sleeve poorly fit in the packaging, and the DVD itself doesn't contain anything more than the episodes. If they don't release any more DVDs in the future after wasting my money on this garbage, I might cry."
4,"Its Adventure Time, you know what you are getting","Gotta love the episodes just wish it could of been a whole season and there are really no special features to speak of, but it is still a great dvd and i am glad i bought it"
4,Adventure Time!,"For any Adventure Time fan this is a must have! They need to produce a series DVD. Also check out ""It Came from the Nightosphere"" it's about 3 hours of AT greatness. My only complaint about this DVD is that it wasn't as long."
4,strange lineup but absolutely great show,"This show is great. I'm a 22 year old male and neither my girlfriend nor I can get enough of it. We love the humor, and I particularly enjoy the snippets we get of the dark background and theme. The non-sensical endings remind me a bit of Aqua Teen Hunger Force but that's about the only similarity. The episodes are cleverly written and the plots are very original, which is saying something for a ""children's"" show.The only reason I rated the DVD 4 stars is because of the peculiar episode selection. They're out of sequence, and I wouldn't say the episodes are my favorites. I'd be really interesting in finding out why these particular episodes were chosen."
5,Adventure Time,fun if you love Adventure Time like my son and I do...worth the $ Arrived quickly! Fun to watch together with my son.Oh my glob!
4,The best of the collection,"I originally bought this for my son to watch, but have come to find myself flipping it on every once in a while too haha. It's a pretty great cartoon compared to most the other stuff of this era. But this is not the first season of episodes, rather a compilation of what produces thought were the best picks from the first and second seasons. I don't believe any of the three seasons have been released in the US as of yet, until then I already pre-ordered the night-o-sphere compilation."
5,Just a simple dude man,"I don't think a day has gone my that my 8 y/o son hasn't watched this DVD. His favorite episodes are on here (Finn showing his long hair) and he couldn't be happier.I agree that they should have released Season 1 and then Season 2, but for the amount of play this has gotten I can't complain.WHAT TIME IS IT?"
5,finn the human,"Cheapest price I could find this dvd for. It arrived before it said it was going to. I watched the entire thing in one night and enjoyed it thoroughly. You don't have to be a kid to love this adorable, hilarious show."
4,Funny stuff!,"We bought this for our daughters to keep them occupied on the airplane trip. They really love this show and surprisingly so does my wife. She didn't get it at first but after she watched a few episodes, she was able to appreciate the adult humor and inside jokes. We really enjoyed the ""Ice Ninja"" episode."
2,Unbelievably strongly scented,"I bought this because it was organic and wanted so much to like it. But the scent, while not unpleasant, was way too strong. I dumped all the powder out and replaced it (in the same container) with unscented, plain cornstarch which I had heard was fine to use in place of powder. The scent from the packaging was so strong that it infused the cornstarch which is now as strongly scented as anything I'd want to use. So I wouldn't recommend this unless you like a really strong scent and even then I'd recommend smelling it first to make sure you like this particular scent since it is so strong."
4,pretty good,"I really liked the beginning of the book when they didn't know who the other was and also the way they found out they were betrothed. However, after this point, I felt like it dragged a little until the very end, which was very exciting.It was a good book, not my favorite; I probably will never read it again, but it was good enough to provide ample entertainment.One thing I really liked about it was that Cassie and Devlyn were always able to talk out their problems before they got to the ""big misunderstanding."""
2,eh,"I read numerous romance novels and this was not so great. I don't think it's so wild and wicked that you make love the day before you get married. Oh, the scandal [sarcasm]. It also didn't seem to move along very well. It definately wasn't a page-turner."
4,suposed to be good,"Fueled by classic hits, such as the animated film Ninja Scroll and the best-selling manga book Lone Wolf and Cub, the fascination with ninjas and samurai has reached peak levels in the last few years. This valuable resource covers the weapons and tools of the legendary samurai and their deadly foes, the ninja, along with a variety of relevant characters, such as feudal lords, the Kunoichi or female ninja, the mendicant Zen priests, and merchants. By providing readers with a detailed look at appearance, facial expressions, clothing, and weaponry, this book will give artists the knowledge and ability to creategreat-looking comic books of this genre. It is a one-of-a-kind reference for any manga artist aspiring to create his or her samurai and ninja action series.found this"
2,$7.95 and it smells fine but didn't clean the greasiest pan,The attraction is the packaging and the evocative name: Mrs. Meyers Lemon Verbena - wow! Now I know and I better not forget that this was not an acceptable alternative to Cascade. I avoid this attractively packaged brand ever since this experience.
2,Don't read this one first,Don't make this the first Earlene Fowler you read. I thought Benni's character was really flat and hard to relate to. Other major characters such as Dove hardly even get an introduction of her own--Fowler asssumes you've alread one of her books. I read Irish Chain (set in Benni's home stomping grounds) later and suddenly I could relate. I though Benni was a kick and I will probably find Kansas Troubles a lot more fun the second time around.
5,Anohter great Benni Harper book,"I really enjoyed this story. Earlene Fowler did a great job of showing us more about Benni & Gabe's relationship and developing their characters. It was wonderful to learn more about Gabe through his interaction with his family and friends from Kansas. I enjoyed all of the knowledge pertaining to the Amish as I always enjoy learning more about them. The book was a fast read and kept my interest throughout. I loved ""touring"" Kansas but the rodeo stuff was a little dry for me. All in all an excellent story and I am now reading the next book. I am in my Benni Harper mode and want to read all of them now!!!"
3,Cute 'n corney,"This book is good for high school girls. The characters were about as flat as the Kansas landscape and not too colorful. What's with all the Coke instead of it's real name: Coca-Cola? Ple-e-ease. Too many characters had tightening around their mouths and eyes,and la-de-da didn't it all just end hunky-dorey with all their cowboy stuff and country songs and churchey junk. What's with all the fist raising done by the main character? I can't believe what passes for good reading today. I know I'm not about to read another one of this Bennie Harper stuff, I'm just used to better. I guess this book may appeal to christian country bumpkin types who don't have much of a life beyond songs by Rany Travis and the like. This writer ought to read some of the better ""English"" (that's England - across the ocean, get it?) writers who really know how to write. But, the story was somewhat cute in its own way"
4,A great FAST-read fun mystery!,"I met Earlene at a Quilt Show in San Diego, and bought the book. The quilting connection is pretty strong, and as a quilter, I especially enjoyed that. The ""mystery"" element catches you, and it is definitely a good ""curl up in a comfy"" and read to the end. Benni IS a bit too feminist in her relationship with Gabe, but all in all, I very much enjoyed the story. Well written, I'll go back to the first book and read the series"
3,Kind of Disappointing,"I'm a Slick Shoes fan, and was excited about this CD, but when I finally got it, I was disappointed. The Slick Shoes songs, although not terrible, are the worst I have heard from them - they just sound kind of sloppy and not that well written. The biggest problem I have though is that the production sucks. The vocals are WAY too loud and everything else is muffled and wet sounding. Not what I expected from Slick Shoes.The Cooter songs, on the other hand, are very good - very catchy. All though I had never heard Cooter before I bought this CD, they are the reason I don't regret buying it."
4,Dlikc all the way,this cd brings out the punk and if you like hard punk music then this cd is for you Slikc shoes rock man
1,Not the real deal.,"I purchased this power supply as a replacement for the original power brick, which exploded. Why can't Microsoft make these things dual voltage to save morons like me the trouble?The first thing I noticed about my new power supply is that the power cord itself was only two-pronged, lacking the third grounding wire. A cause for concern considering Microsoft OEM power supplies have the grounding wire.The company that manufactured this power brick has gone to great lengths to keep its name a secret. I could not find a name or logo on the box or on the brick itself, unless it was written in Chinese. Shady.Powered on the thing makes a horrible racket. I've worked around airplanes quieter than this monster. It honestly sounded like a vacuum cleaner.Intolerably loud, I didn't feel like waiting for this cheap knock off to catch fire and burn my house down, so I chucked it. Hopefully my genuine Microsoft power brick arrives before Fallout 3 and Left 4 Dead!"
1,DOA,"DOA in a plastic bag - not my definition of ""new"".It has the same orange light as the original one I'm trying to replace. To be sure I tried several outlets, and tested the outlets with a volt meter - that's not the issue. The old one likely over-heated, probably because of dust :(, the ""new"" one just came defective."
1,Wrong Item recieved!,"The first picture was the one I needed of a 203 watt power chord, and I received a 175 watt chord that is of course non compatible. DO NOT BUY BECAUSE THEY WILL SEND THE WRONG ONE!"
1,Wrong Power Supply,There are multiple types of XBOX 360 Power Supplies. Make sure you know exactly which one you need. This one looks like it could be the right one. I needed a 203w. This is a picture of a 150w. It would not work with my system.
1,wrong product,"The item I received was labeled ""Xbox Slim"" and ""135W."" The sellers for this item listing seem to rotate rapidly. Mine came from ""Super Electronics."" Returning and buying local to be sure I get the right item."
2,lasted a couple months,"worked well when we got it, but is now dead giving the RROD, and red fault light on power supply, all with light use"
1,Busted out of the Box,"Can't say I'm pleased with this. At least it arrived on time. Unfortunately, it was broken as soon as I opened the box: The light was red (instead of orange) as soon as I plugged it in, and it last about a day and a half before dying completely.A waste of money, especially since it turned out that the power supply that it was supposed to replace just needed time to cool down and was back to normal. This, on the other hand, hasn't had the same luck."
5,Power brick for first gen xbox 360,"The item arrived as described ""New"" and work perfect. Beware that there are 4 different version of xbox 360s our on the market and knowing what power brick to buy as a replacement is crucial. The sell displayed a viewable image on the page and I was able to identify what model of power supply ""220V"" I needed as a replacement."
4,AC 203w Power supply XBOX 360,"If you have a HAlo addition this is what you need!to find out what wattage you need on the bottom of yours, on the sticker underneth. Look 4 (""Output DC""*%$# 203w)the # with the (w) is youe output"
1,"Don't buy this, this is NOT XBox 360 Power Supply","Save yourself hassle and don't order this item, because it is not XBOX 360 Power Supply. It is a power supply of some sort, but not for XBOX 360. I bought this and now have to go through pain of returning this :("
1,Defective Power cord,"I received the power cord and plugged it in and the light indicator did not turn on, on the box part of the cord. But to double check i still plugged it into my Xbox 360 and it still did not work. After i sent the seller an email back he didnt not respond to me, and still has yet to do so, and i have now filed my claim to get reimbursed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS GUY!!!!!"
1,Item listing is inaccurate.,The item listing specifically states that the power supply supports XBOX 360's requiring 203 watt power bricks. This power brick is rated at 175 watts and the connector doesn't fit 203w XBOX 360's.
1,False advertising.,"The description says ""item works with Consoles that require 203W or less."" However, this is not the case. I received an adapter with only a 175 Watt output which does not work with the older xboxs that require 203 Watts of power to work! The plugs are just slightly different, but they do not work. False advertising sucks. Especially when you were depending on it to fix an xbox in time for Christmas."
2,LOUD! But works,"The good: It powers my X-Box 360 with no problems.The bad: It's LOUD! The fan must be loose or something because unless I position it exactly right, the brick is extremely loud and distracting, to the point where if you have it in your bedroom and want to watch a movie it's almost too distracting to watch anything."
1,Didn't work,"This thing didn't work with my xbox, I recommend calling xbox costumer service or buying a different power supply. As soon as I took the thing out the package and plugged it into my xbox it didn't work and it had the same red light as the first one. It was probably a defective or a used power supply."
1,Stay Away!,"I should have listened to the negative reviews I read here. I received the product and it failed to work right out of the box. I have since returned it. The first thing I noticed after opening the box is that the power brick looked used and repackaged. I would not recommend purchasing this product. I have since placed a replacement order with Microsoft. You'll pay a little extra, but at least you know it's legit."
1,This is not an xbox 360 power supply,"Warning - even though the product says it is xbox 360 power supply it is not. Of course it is Microsoft's fault for having two different connectors for different xbox 360 consoles, but this product should say so in large font before describing the item. My console says xbox 360, it does not say special xbox with wierd power connector. Now I have to debate buying an adaptor that will allow me to connect it to my xbox or sending it back. Anyone know if adaptors work or is the power requirement different for xbox 360 vs xbox 360?"
2,Works somewhat,"Works for about 25-45 minutes on average and then shuts off, mid-use. Not the official microsoft branded one that came with the original xbox."
1,Don't buy this Power supply!!!,This thing burned out after a month and a half. It's cheap. Don't even think about buying this thing!! Just pay the money for a real Microsoft power supply.
1,Another receiver of the wrong thing,"I guess I should blame myself that I read the product description, believed it, and ordered this item....as all of the comments and feedback are clear that they actually ship a completely different power supply for a different Xbox 360. Yet I still can't understand that, despite all the feedback here describing the problem that the company doesn't fix the description."
5,It works,"All I had to do was buy this and I got a free xbox360, no brainer. Its the type of power chord I needed and it works. Need I say more?"
1,wrong part,had to return it. it was the wrong power cord and wrong plug. the plugs did not plug together either.
1,False Advertising...don't waste your time or money,"Selected this item because description says ""item works with Consoles that require 203W or less"". My XBox 360 requires a 203W power supply. The plug that goes to Xbox 360 does not fit and power supply is clearly marked 175W (less than the 203W required). Now 4 days before a birthday party that was going to feature some new Kinect games, I'm scrambling for a replacement."
1,360 Banshee Power Cord,"Well, as you may suspect there is something fishy about the referenced title to a review. Soon however, the mysterious cloud which looms in curiosity will fizzle out. Leaving only the truth and a sense of false security. This power cord is unassuming as you initially use it like any other 360 power cord of early decent. That is !!! its way of luring you in, waiting for your to be defenseless and vulnerable mid-game. Then, as if in the distance you hear a shrill and mind numbing cry! Yes, that's right, but; that's not all. It gets louder and louder! till, all that is even seen in a metaphorical sense; is a mental though inside your head of a person with long fingernails scraping a chalk board inside ones ear drum. Frightful, to say the least."
5,xBox power supply,"This xBox power supply was purchased for use with a used xBox. I did not even realize that there were various types of xBox power supplies until I tried to borrow one to test the used console and found that it did not fit. It was helpful to see the graphic of the power supply buying guide, to assure that I ordered the right one.And I did get the right one. It arrived promptly and has worked reliably, no complaints. The star-rating system is inviting me to tell you ""how much fun is this game"" and ""how do you rate this game overall?"" Hard to think of a power supply as fun, but overall the product rating is 5 stars because it works and it was reasonably priced, so good value for cost.And while this is a product rating, I would note that my seller (Finest Play) sent a follow up email after a month, to check on my satisfaction with the order."
1,Plug didn't work,Arrived timely but didn't work wasn't worth the price to send it back.This was for an x-box had to get a cord directly from the company with cost alot.
4,Totally great,I bought an XBOX 360 for my boyfriend and we have had it almost two yrs. Suddenly the XBOX was shutting off on specific games. My boyfriend could only play for 30 minutes or so but then it wold shut off in the middle of the game. I was so worried that I would have to get a new one and that it would no longer work. Someone suggested that it could be the power supply. So instead of trying more expensive things I went ahead and order this to try it. I got it and plugged it into the XBOX and had my boyfriend test it. It worked!!! My boyfriend can now play all night long no matter what game. Would totally recommend. Great product.
1,I also received the wrong item,Ordered the 150w and got the 135w that does not work with the new Xbox Connect...read some of the most recent comments from others. Drats!
1,dont buy,i bought this thinking it was for the old xbox-360 but got the newer one for the 360 slim..it really pissed me off when it arrived and i opened the package seeing the cable
1,Sold By Super Electronics AKA E2E WRONG ITEM SHIPPED,"Ordered. Shipped free 2 day shipping under PRIME Trial membership. Excited to get back to Skyrim and got screwed over when I opened it up and found and XBox Slim AC adapter. Thanks a lot. Not anything near what I needed. Should have known why there were such an increasing number of 1 star ratings. I went to look at the item again and it showed that it was being sold by E2E, who I thought was different than Super Electronics, but once I added it to my cart and looked at the description it showed it as being sold by Super Electronics. Both have their own stores, but I'm guessing they're the same - don't buy from either until they straighten it out. I've emailed Super Electronics and if I get a response I will post here."
1,Received the wrong item.,"The product description specifically says ""This item does not work for the newest version XBOX 360 SLIM for Kinect"" but that is what I received. I ordered an AC adapter for the XBOX 360 Elite (150W) and received the XBOX 360 Slim (135W) version. Pathetic.AC Power Supply for Microsoft XBOX 360"
1,Wrong item,"As others have said I received the one for the X-360 Slim... It clearly shows/states how this is for the Xbox 360, not any other addition. Come on Amazon, get with the program."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"The item in picture is not the one I received. Seller, please pay attention to detail. There are very clear differences between the XBOX 360 power supplies."
1,NOT AN XBOX 360 Power Supply!,This does not work for any type of Xbox 360 that I own! This is a FAKE!!! Save yourself time and money and buy something else!
1,worng one,they gave me a diffrent one that i needed. i needed a 203w one so i thought that they had it so i bought it. when i got it. it was a diffrent size so it was a waste of $23 that i spent. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1,DO NOT BUY,"This was a bad purchase, the voltage and wattage ARE NOT the same as an official power box and can therefor FRY YOUR SYSTEM."
1,"Waste of time, waste of money","The cord they sent was incompatible with the adapter. Thankfully, Amazon was good about giving me a refund. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
1,doesnt even PLUG IN,"note: this is NOT about the power supply termination into the xbox unitthe powerbrick has a 3-vertical prong male adapter that plugs into the power supply cable that goes into the wallthe supplied power cable has a 2-vertical prong female end......... so the damned power cable doesnt even hook up to the brick itself.also, its not possible to use a generic computer PSU cable because the male end of the power supply has a little notch. i suppose it can be sanded down with a dremel"
1,Dosn't work,"Although i did get the item in 3 days, the brick and cord did not match. and even after finding a cord that will go with a 2 pronged brick no lights would come on. All in all a total waste of money!"
4,Preschooler loves this,"I have a 3-year old who loves cats, yet loves to torture our own cat.He took to this book at the library, so I had to buy it.Good find. Will teach your child to honor their pets."
5,An Excellent Streetpunk Compilation,"While there are a couple of flaws, this may very well be the best modern streetpunk comp. I've ever heard. All the songs ( aside from the Voids song, which is ok, but may get a little annoying, and The Street Brats song) rock, and really show what the genre is supposed to sound like. Featuring bands we all know and love such as The Virus, A Global Threat, and The Unseen, and more underground bands like Complete Control and Krumbums, this is sure to be in your cd player for weeks. And, despite the fact that there are 32 (!!) tracks, the cd just doesn't get old. The best songs are ""We Are All That We Have"", ""Cease Fire"", ""Reaction"", and ""Cardinal Sin""."
5,New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible: Large Print Edition,The book is excellant for bible study and the Large Print gives you the extra you need to fine everythging you want or are looking for
5,Strong's Concordance,I have used Strong's Concordance for years in all my Bible Study. With advancing years my eyesight needed larger print. I was so delighted to find it was available in larger print and at a very affordable price. This edition fills the bill for anyone needing larger print.
4,Biblical Research,"After spending over 15 years in biblical research, I have found this to be a useful tool. Especially if you combine it with Young's Analytical. The two together open the bible to easy understanding. Wow!"
2,not large print,"The New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible: Large Print Edition.Product claims to be a large print edition, but the print is not like a large print Bible and so the print is too small to be called a large print. I was disappointed in the print size."
1,Still Waiting for New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Comfort Print,"Have not received it yet from ""Between the Pages"". It's suppose to be LATE this week; which make their service much less than expected, and for a first time customer, it's a bad reflection on Amazon. You need to fix it; and/or return my monies.However, I have received and am enjoying ""God's Eonian Purpose"" by Adlai Loudy, and ""Concordant commentary on the New Testament"" by A. E. Knoch."
1,strongs concordance,have not received this book or answer to the e-mail I sent. What gives? I will wait one more week then file claim at bank to retrieve monies charged for this product.
3,Disappointment,"I found the sound of Kiri te Kanawa's voice here shocking. I think she sounds like an old lady - which was obviously because of the emotionally turbulent period of her life that she found herself in. If you want to buyt his Dvd for vocal beauty, dont! however, if you are prepared to make some concessions and enjoy the singing of one of the great female singers of the last 30 years - the musical art - then do. She has done better though!"
4,"Beautiful, Informative Guide to Indiana Cabinets !!","This updated 134 page guide-book has been updated from the previous edition, with more than 30 new pages. It's loaded with plenty of super photos, and includes a brief introduction to the collectible. You'll find plenty of manufacturers' catalog pages shown, along with advertising pieces. Collector's will find it interesting and informative. It covers Boon, Hoosier, Kitchen Maid, McDougall, Napanee, Sellers, Wilson Cabinets, and others. A worthwhile addition to your library."
5,Up the Bracket,"This album is fantastic. Mountains of raw energy are packed into nearly every single song. I can't think of any tracks I consistently skip on the entire record. For some, it may be a little much. I stumbled on this band who is apparently well known in Britain through a list the Arctic Monkeys influences page. If you're looking for something similar to their ridiculously catchy choruses and relatively fun atmosphere, you may not love the Libertines. Still, Up the Bracket does have some killer verses and lyrics, as well as some interesting and versatile choruses and hooks. Some of the songs boarder on reckless sounding, but I think the ""raw"" recording style is well suited for their sound. Highly recommended."
5,One of my favorites,"Watchers by far is my favorite Dean Koontz novel, followed closely by this book. It kept me intrigued from start to finish."
4,A conventional plot device told in an unconvential way,"(Spoiler warning)Laura Shane has a guardian angel, and this man's appearance seems to coincide with bone-chilling lightning storms. Of course, it's not coincidental because Laura's protector is a time-traveler.I consider this story to be one of the more unique takes on the time-travel genre. Time-travel plots by nature are constrained by finely-explained science fiction rules lest the author leave too many gaping plot holes. Lightning by Dean Koontz introduced a new perspective of time travel for me, and although many criticized the story's need for continual explanation, I relished the dialogued because these are the same discussions I have with my friends on occasion.Additionally, Laura Shane's life is one full of tragedy in spite of her guardian angel's efforts. The book has overtones of helplessness against fate and of living with the sorrows one faces. I found these bits of wisdom relevant in my own life."
5,Great Read,I have read this book several times and I still cant get enough. I was instantly hooked. I have enjoyed Dean Koontz for many years but this book is my favorite of his by far. A must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy.
5,One of the best books,When I brought this book I put it on the headboard of my bed. MY MISTAKE!!!!!!!!! I got sick and had nothing to do but read. I picked up this book and could not and i repeat could not put it down. i took it every where. I loved it. It made me cry it made me laught it made me think. The romance was wonderful. Her son was a great charactor. Mr. Koontz out did himself on this one.
4,"Excellent book, well written page turner","An excellent story that is revealed page after page to keep the reader interested. Has a bit of sci-fi time travel, action, love, and friendship. I don't read a lot of books, but with my new Kindle for Christmas, this one kept me reading until late at night (finished in 2 days). I look forward to reading more Koontz!"
4,Great Momentum!,"It only has a couple ""slow parts"", but they're the main character thinking his way through what's going on, so they're necessary.The last 100 pages or so FLY BY!!A very entertaining read & well worth every penny!Here's how I ranked Koontz books that I've read so far, so you can compare your taste with mine:(Favorite to least favorite)1-Odd Thomas2-Frankenstein 1 (a very very close second!)3-Frankenstein 2 (a very very close third!)4-Watchers (a very very close fourth!)5-From The Corner Of His Eye6-Lightning7-Velocity (a very close 6th)8-Brother Odd9-The Key To Midnight10-Odd Hours11-Forever Odd12-The Taking"
5,"This was my first Koontz, but definitely not the last!","This was the best, by far, of all the Koontz novels in my opinion. I have read them all but Santa's Evil Twin and always recommend this one first!"
5,ONE OF THE BEST KOONTZ!!!! BRILLIANT!!!,"This one is definitely in the upper echelon of Koontz!!! I can't recommend this one highly enough! He has several that are really over the top, even for him! Truly outstanding! I almost cried when this book ended, I was so disappointed!! I wish it had been 3000 pages! The plot in this one was a departure from his ""usual"" (if you can really find a ""usual"" with him)!! The characters in this one were, I think, the most developed that I've seen in any of his books. This was one of the most satisying novels I have ever read. This one had supernatural (of the science fiction type) and suspense and excitement. It's up there with ""One Door Away from Heaven"" and ""Strangers"" and ""Watchers."" I don't like to give a synopsis for his books; I don't want to spoil anything. One of the best reads ever!!!"
4,Another Great Book!,"I have always read a lot of Dean Koontz's books, however, this is one that I must have read at least eight times. I've had it for years and it is so well read that I'm afraid it's going to start falling apart. It's a really fun book to read, not quite as nerve racking as some of his others, but has a great rhythm to it. There are wonderful characters in this book and you'll find yourself being drawn farther and farther into the story. I don't want to give anything away, but you have to read this book if you like Koontz at all. ...that easy to read rhythm and trust me, you'll be turning pages all night long."
4,Excellent,"Not the masterpiece I remember reading in the 80s, but still a solid story with nicely developed characters, and a thoroughly executed complex plot. Koontz remains a master of language, but in this case some descriptions felt a bit repetitious.This was the first Koontz book I ever read back in 1988 and I can see why it stuck in my memory as an excellent read. This second go around wasn't quite the same experience."
5,One of my favorite Dean Koontz books,"No need to go into detail about this story, since I'm sure many of the other reviewers have done that. Suffice to say, this book and Watcher's are my two favorite Koontz books, though I have to admit I've liked nearly all of them. He's got some really nice twisty stories, where you think you know what's going on and then find out you don't. This is one of them. Loved it."
5,Solid Koontz,"Out of the Koontz books I have read so far, this is definitely one of my favorites. The pacing and characters are solid, and the plot - while a bit farfetched - is also worked in a way that is very plausible, making for a thought-provoking, solid, entertaining, and exciting read. I definitely loved the mix of characters, especially the owner of the Pizza Palace. I nearly laughed at Koontz' description of his body and manners, and the way he treated Laura and her son.The action sequences are also thrilling, and I also rather enjoyed the introduction/first few chapters. It's different from the rest of the story, but in a good way since it serves as a wonderful setup. This is truly Dean Koontz at some of his finest, 4.75/5 stars and two thumbs up!"
4,Sci-fi Koontz,"This is one of his earlier books from the 80's, not horror and not yet quite as philosophical. Nevertheless, a very original story, and hard to characterize completely. The first part describes the life of the orphaned heroine and her guardian...we follow her through finding her true love, marriage and then the storyline turns into the time travel adventure. Will the bad guys win? Lots of twists and turns, with the overhanging, Destiny can reassert itself...Entertaining and foreshadows some of the repeating themes in later novels. Lost children, inescapable fate. Good read for fans."
5,"Powerfull, enticing & mindboggling, Koontz does it again!!","Once again, Koontz manages to totalally enthrawl the reader. His brilliant portrayel of charecters and events totally encapulates the reader and takes them far past their wildest imaginations. Lightening strikes and the terror begins..kind of an ironic phenonemon. It was a fairy-tale turn nightmare - I loved this book!!"
3,Typical Koontz,"Lightning was well written, as Dean Koontz always is. Certain things about the book were fairly predictable, but there were a couple of turns that I found surprising. I found the time-travel thing slightly strange, but I suppose it worked within the story. It was the first book I had read by Koontz in about 5 years, and it was on the suggestion of a friend that I read it. Personally, I believe there are much better Koontz books out there, but this one certainly helped pass the time."
4,Great Book,This was a good book.It started out weird and confusing.You have to read the whole thing to understand it.It wasn't stupid in the begining though.It was a thriller from start to finish
4,12 year olds don't talk like that...,"I enjoyed the book, but was put off in the beginning by the dialogue of the 12-year-old twins. I'm sorry, but 12-year-olds just simply would not have such a vocabulary, or be as wise as they were portrayed. Getting past that, though, I did enjoy the book enough that I tore through it in 2 days."
2,well written crap,i liked this book until i saw where he was going with it then it became just dumb like the movies on the syfy channel
4,Two parts; one great the other good,"This was the first Dean Koontz book I've read and it got me hooked. The book is broken into two parts, the first introduces you to laura and brings you into her life, while giving you glimpses of what her future holds. When part one is over you are still full of so many questions and wonder what could be happening here with a strange man who tries to make Laura's life easier and extends her life. If possible the second half is even stranger than the first, you learn what comes of Laura as she reaches her 30th birthday, who the man is and why he's trying to save her. Filled with tons of suspense and twists and turns that will have you turning pages frantically to find out what happens next....just a great read and goes by pretty fast"
4,Figured it out,"I loved the story, the premise and everything about the book except.... I figured out the twist halfway through the book and it took work to finish it.However, I honestly don't understand why this book hasn't been turned into a movie yet... great premise!"
5,Great Book!,I couldn't put it down. It really held my attention. Good story if you're interested in time travel and things that can result from it.
5,I don't know what's wrong with you people.,"My uncle gave me a huge pile of Dean Koontz and Stephen King novels that he had already read, and Lightning was one of them. I think that it is seriously one of the best books I have ever read. It had a fascinating storyline and plot, great characters, and it actually made me think. It was just my kind of book. I'm into alternate reality fiction, and while this wasn't exactly that, it was close. The time-travel plot was unique and interesting. It was just such a great book. I don't know how anyone could dislike it."
4,Great Time Travel Tale,"Koontz crosses genres and spins a fascinating time travel tale that entertains and satisfies. Best-selling novelist Laura Shane has lived a difficult life full of tragedy and heartache. Throughout her life the same man continually appears at just the right moment and repeatedly saves her life. However, each time Laura encounters him she notices he has never aged. Who is this mysterious guardian angel and why is he watching over her?Koontz has written another powerful story full of mystery, suspense, and just the right touch of romance. A great addition for Koontz fans."
5,BEST BOOK EVER,I read this book my junior year in High School (3 years ago) and it still stands as my favorite book. I have even been caught taking it off my shelf and flipping through it and re-reading it.
2,Not that impressed,"This was the first Koontz I've read. He's no Stephen King, for sure, but mildly entertaining. I thought the dialogue was really dumb, and his depiction of an 8 - year old, even a really smart 8 year old, is pretty lame. (Reminds me of a bad made for TV movie.)"
2,Not Really Great....,"The Book was very good in the beginning and then it got boring in the middle. Most of the book was unbelievable, the dialogue was just so fake. It took me forever to read this book because it made me feel tired and I thought this was Dean's weakest book."
1,An okay story ruined by plot contrivences...,"Scientist from the future uses time travel to protect the life of a girl in our time. She grows up through several horrific events to become an author. A passible story gets jolted in serveral points as Koontz attempts to explain major plot holes by saying his protagonist ""did research on it for a novel"""
5,This is simply th best SF book ever written!,"Words can not explain what this book makes you feel. Just get it, and read it! It realy is the best SF book EVER written from the thousands that I have read. A masterpiece that ranks among the best books ever written for the last couple of thousand years (including Ancient Greek mythology)."
4,!A Twisting confussing Nightmare!,"Lightning being the first book that I read of Dean R. Kootz, at a young age, I found this book to be confussing but extrememly exciting. After reading for the second time he has been the Author that I have come to love and have become a long time reveiwer and my favorite author."
4,A very strong story line,"I see I am one of the lowest ratings. Hmmm. It was a good book, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't suspenceful enough. It was pretty funny, though. That's a plus. The ending was a little predictable. Read it anyway"
5,It's action packed and exciting,This is a cool book. Dean Koontz is an extremely good writer.Read it and see!!!!
5,Couldn't put it down,"I got this book because it was on sale, I started to read it and it jumped right in. I really like books that do that. The more I read the book the more I wanted to read it. The last few nights I got little sleep and was tired at work, I just couldn't put it down until I knew the ending. Great book !!!!!!!!! I have only read one book by him, Mr. Murder, that I didn't enjoy , so I am glad I didn't give up on Mr Koontz after that book. This is a must read book !!!!!!!! The book grips you and doesn't let you go until you know the end, I wanted to get to the end but in a way I was disappointed that I had , no more of that story to read because it was so good."
4,Great read!,I really enjoy all of Dean Koontzs books an this was no exception. I could not put it down. Very well put together and keeps you turning the pages.
2,"Good start, then downhill","""Lighting"" starts out with a bang, and then fades like diminishing thunder. The book is riddled with cliches, stereotypical characters, non sequiturs, and an astonishingly embarassing number of product placements: Smith & Wesson, Disney, McDonald's, Ralph's, Goodwill, Mark Cross, Ray Ban, IBM, etc. etc. Parts of the book are laughable; Laura becoming upset at Chris's use of profanity after Laura has ""blown away"" several of the assassins, Laura's concern about the nutritional value of the food Chris is eating.However, if television shows like ""Survivor"", ""Oprah"", and ""One Life To Live"" appeal to you, this may be the book for you."
2,I really tried to like this book but... (2.5 stars),"I was really hoping to like this book but unfortunately there was hardly anything exciting about it. There were some suspenseful aspects to the novel but the few exciting areas could not make up for the boring parts.The first half of the novel moved really slow and when I finally got to the second half and was expecting things to come full circle, I was left disappointed and surprised by the change in plot. I thought Laura was destined to be some great person with supernautual powers or whatever, hence the reason this stranger made every attempt to protect her, but the book surprised by doing something totally different.The only character I liked was Thelma, though her humor at times was a bit of an overkill."
2,Suspense doesn't make up for cliches and lack of depth,"I admit the story was suspenseful and kept me reading, but the dialogue made me wince with its cheeziness, characters were cliche, the plot was ludicrous, and I was glad when I finally finished it. It seemed like Koontz was writing more of a movie script than a novel. Wishful thinking on his part maybe?"
2,One of his worst.,"This one was too contrived and felt like amateur science fiction. I prefer Koontz when he applies his considerable imagination to stories of horror and evil. Try ""The Bad Place"" or ""Hideaway"" instead."
4,An excellent read. Dean Koontz is a master of suspense.,"There are a lot of books out there about time travel -- some good; some bad. LIGHTNING is one of the better ones. Not quite as good as WATCHERS, but close. Once you start reading, it's hard to put down."
5,I Loved It!,I could not put this book down. I started reading it on New Year's Day & finished it with five minutes to spare until 1998. I'd recommend it to any suspense fan. I also recommend Watchers. That one was really good also.
3,Not as great as his others,"I've loved all of his books in the past. This book was intriguing from early on with his great style of ""supernatural"" , but 3/4 into it it was much too ""in the future"" to get a good grasp of how to follow it. Even though I didn't like it nearly as much as his earlier books, I will always be a Dean Koontz fan."
5,Never a dull moment,Never a dull moment... one of Dean Koontz best novels in my opinion. It is not as gruesome or disturbing as some of his novels. It also has a lot of mystery with such a creative storyline.
4,Another great book,Can hardly put it down. Yet another fantastic book by Koontz. Not sure how he continues to keep my attention but this is a winner
4,Great book,"Dean Koontz is an amazing writer, and with someone narrating his stories its always so amazing. Lightnings plot sometimes bounced around, but the character development by Koontz(Like always) is amazing. Each person draws you in to eventually feel like a bond is formed between you and that character, select few writers have that kind of talent. Listen to it and enjoy!"
5,Fast Paced and Highly Entertaining,"I picked up my first Dean Koontz novel in high school, after seeing his name on an old bookmark that said ""If you like Stephen King, try these authors ..."" It's been more than a decade since then and I've now read all of Koontz's novels. And, while I don't think he's in the same league as King, he continues to entertain me most of the time (which is all I'm really looking for when I sit down with a book).""Lightening"" remains my favorite Koontz work, and one of my all-time favorite, pure pleasure reads. It's definitely more of a thriller than a horror novel, though there is a bit of fantasy thrown in. ""Lightening"" won't change your life, but it's a great action-packed story with a super twist that perks up what could have been a typical action/thriller genre storyline.A great beach book or perfect for a rainy day, ""Lightening"" will keep you involved and entertained."
5,His best work,"This was the second Dean Koontz book I read after mindnight, almost 10 years ago, and I still can remeber how much it effected me. This is by far his best book, and I have read every single book he has written. The story of time travel, and how one single minute can change our entire future was cleverly written. I admit there were some problems with the time travel explantation, but they weren't bad enough to ruin the book."
5,Lightning is one of my favorite Koontz novels to date!,"After a friend handed me Koontz's novel, Lightning, I simply couldn't put it down. It kept me in suspense throughout. It is definitely as 'keeper' as I will continue to pick this novel up again for numerous read overs. I think Koontz should adapt this one to a movie in the near future!"
5,One of Koontz best,"After reading most of Dean Koontz's books, I found Lighting to be refreshing from a woman's standpoint. The days that Laura spent in an orphanage, trying to dodge a child predator were alarming. Caught up in Laura's emotional trauma, I was just as horrified when her husband was killed. With mostly every one that she loves taken from her, Karen's life and death battle to protect her son was intense and her guardian popping unexpectedly in and out of her life, altering history, was a great twist. I highly recommend this book. Tamera Lawrence, author of THE POND"
5,This book kicked a**!!,"Dean Koontz is my favorite author, and this book really shows his talent. His mix of science fiction (time travel), suspense, and reality has rarely been expressed by many authors; except for Koontz. He has a talent for great climaxes and plots, and he's able to delve into the human mind and soul."
5,Lightning is perhaps Dean Koontz' best work.,"I've owned one or more formats of this book for many years; this purchase was a kindle version so I can have some leisure reading along with my work-related materials on my Kindle. If you haven't read Lightning, please give it a try. I'm not saying it will be the best book you've ever read, because everyone is different. But I have practically everything Dean Koontz has written (except for some rare early work before he reached his current prowess), and Lightning is one of my favorites. I hope you like it too."
5,Awesome Book!!!,"Dean Koontz is an amazing author. This book was given to for my birthday from a good friend that is a huge fan of Dean. I'm not one to read much but I gave it a shot and wrote a report on it back in tenth grade.Through out the story this man keeps saving this girls life. She is always wondering who this man is, down to the day of her birth her is by her side. Though, he only shows up when something is going wrong.Whats amazing is how time travel is implemented in this book. Going from the present then back to the reign of Adolf Hitler. She is an importmant person to the future of mankind.I highly recommend this book to anybody that is into thrillers, this story will come to life and you will see this play in your head with all the detail Dean implements into this book."
1,Hard time believing this is Koontz' work,"The basic idea behind the story is good. But I thought it was a bit too hard to follow. At times, I felt like reading this book was pulling teeth without anesthesia. It was also a little bit too long. I kept waiting for a plot to unravel quickly, like most of his other books, but it took too long. In conclusion, I have a hard time believing that the author who wrote such great pieces of work as ""Phantoms"" and ""The Vision"" also wrote this. But i guess we all have our bad days."
1,Blatant rip-off of Terminator,Koontz should be forced to pay royalities on the plots that he has stolen over the years. Doesn't this guy have an original thought in his head. I had high hopes for him after I read Watchers. I thought that he was the next Stephen King. Boy was I wrong. With each book since Watchers he has stolen more and more from competent authors and this one takes the cake.
1,Even Worse Than Koontz's Usual Trash,"Listening to this book on tape was even more painful than reading it because of the phony slavic accents. Koontz always lacks interesting characterization & any flair in his prose, and this time he also lacks an original story. ""Ho-hum..."" and ""Who gives a good goddamn?"" flittered through my mind as this inane rip-off of a story prattled on. Worse than listening to your best friend describe the minute fluctuations in her bad relationship."
1,STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"stupid characters [Note for Mr. Koontz]Since you have never come up with a good by yourself,why don't you throw in the bloody towel? 1 star."
2,Noble attempt at a novel...just doesn't work,"""Allende' by Fernando Alegria, is a very noble attempt at accurating portraying the tragedy of Salvador Allende, and the ""other"" 9/11. It fails to be entertaining, and it uses references that only a South American could understand or relate to. This is not good if you want to reach a general audience, which I assume is Alegria's intent. Allende is portrayed as a complicated, stubborn, heroic man who tried to reform an unfair system, and was destroyed for it. The book is not flattering to the USA at all, and does feature a cameo by Che Guavera that doesn't work at all. Bargain bin material, but not much else."
2,cute but uncomfortable,These shoes are so cute but as the day wore on they got tighter and tighter. There is no give in them. I had horrible sores on the back of my feet and toes.
5,"Enchanting, A Real Delight...","A fun read...very likable characters. Set in 1700's England. One comes to love Viveca, a street urchin who overcomes loss & disappointment to find success and the love of dashing Byrne St. James. Some characters appear in following books...Smart, funny at times and enjoyable."
4,Great Album,This is another good album from a great folk song writer. He is one of the best singer songwriters I have listened to.
5,Magnificent! Evokes all the emotion & adventure of the film.,"Each cut on this CD evokes the drama, adventure and tension of the motion picture. From the opening cut ""SURROUNDED"" until the last, ""THE QUEEN APPROACHES"", this soundtrack brings back each scene of the film. There are classical influences throughout the score, so one does not have to have seen the film to enjoy the music, however the music would seem to be more enjoyable when an image from the movie can be conjured up, as only music can do. As a lover of movie soundtracks, I highly recommend this one."
5,Superb!,"This soundtrack is not bad at all, I really do like it a lot. The music is powerful, and captures your heart when you listen to track 2 (ESPECIALLY track 2!). This is a great CD- buy it now!"
5,I LOVED IT!,This soundtrack is so moving. It is one of the best movie scores I have ever heard. I would recommend this to everyone!
4,Amazing but with one flaw,"I love this soundtrack! It's the perfect way to accent this wonderful movie.I have grown up with this movie and sometimes I think I love the music more than the film itself!My only problem with this soundtrack is that something in the coding has gotten mixed up, and so the songs are all out of order!I mean, the second track appears at the VERY end of the movie! The song titles do match with the audio though, I know because I can recognize a lot of them from their respective places in the filmSo if you purchase this you must re-arrange the track order on your music player.Then all you have to do is sit back and enjoy Nick Glennie-Smith's wonderfully orchestrated masterpiece."
5,What a wonderful CD!,"This CD was really awesome! The composer did a great job of varying the moods that the music portrays. Some of the songs have dark, angrey moods, and others, light and happy moods. My friend first suggested that I borrow it, and two days after, I went out and bought my own copy. One of the very best soundtracks ever!"
4,FANTE PISSES on HIS FATHER from TALL BUILDINGS ...,"He's the best of the ""I'm in the gutter"" writers .. and I've been in the gutter ... and I REALLY don't want to go where he goes ... whatever they advance him to write his books ..."
5,It is like John Fante and more,"Excellent novel, his father John and Charles Bukowsky are present, nevertheless Dan Fante has a vioce of his own. Worth every penny."
4,Easy Read,"I was excited to read this book since the author is the son of John Fante. Fante is usually brought up in connection with Bukowski since Hank was a fan of his. Much like his father's work, Dan Fante writes about a regular Joe. Like Bukowski, this character goes through a miriad of jobs and thinks himself a sexual dynamo. Unfortunately, this is where it feels like Augusten Burroughs has taken over. The character is bisexual and the descriptions of sexual escapades are a little too clear for my taste.That aside, I could visual the characters and did enjoy the story in general. Good book for the beach or the pool."
1,One of the Worst Books I Own,"Please don't waste your money on this book. It's terrible. I wish someone would have told me that before I wasted my money on this crap. If you're interested in dirtbags, at least read something good like Fante's father, or Bukowski, or Algren, or Selby, or better yet, buy a Velvet Underground or Stooges album. Or, hell, put a down payment on a bag of herion or head down to Sunset and sodomize a prostitute (male or female). I guarantee you it'll be more entertaining, even for $13. You can even shout, ""I am officially a total scumbag!"" Which is basically what Fante does on every page of this completely generic novel."
3,King Kong Blu-ray,"King Kong has been one of my favorite movies and I have owned copies in VHS,DVD and now in Blu-ray.I could not wait to get the Blu-ray copy. I see little or no differance in the picture and was very disappointed in the Blu-ray copy."
3,King Kong (1933),"The story is simple yet entertains throughout, from the discovery of the primitive tribe of Skull Island that worships Kong, to the kidnapping of beautiful Faye Wray, to the many perils faced by the men who are pursuing the great ape through the jungle, and finally to Kong's destructive rampage through New York City. The final scenes atop the empire state building are awesome with the city spread out below and the camera taking the point-of-view of the biplanes zooming towards the giant ape. Truly astounding special effects for such an old movie."
3,"Nice package, but grainy transfer.","I have shown many prints of King Kong, both in35mm and 16mm, and have never encountered thelevel of grain as seen here. It is certainlysharper and with more detail than the 60thanniversary Laserdisc. The track is better thananticipated. This grainy quality is alsopresent in the recent ""Top Hat"" issue."
1,Reviews are misleading!!,"More than 3/4 of the reviews listed here are reviews of a DVD release--or a VHS release. VERY FEW are for the KING KONG BLU RAY BOOK. This blu ray version has been listed on Amazon for at least a year, and not as a pre-order. The official blu ray release wasn't until September 2010--How does this happen? I buy EVERYTHING from Amazon, and this is the first time I've been afraid of what I'd get. A poor-quality blu-ray that was somehow produced (bootlegged??) prior to the 2010 release? To show ""270 reviews"" on the product listing and then have more than 3/4 of those reviews be for a totally different product is DISHONEST! Shame on Amazon!"
3,A Good King?,"As Mel Brooks once said, it is good to be king. So it is good to be King Kong. Because if he wasn't king, he would be Peasant Kong, or Bourgeoisie Kong, but not King Kong.What is confusing is how did he get to be king? I think maybe the movie should show how this all happened. In a democracy you get elected but in a kingdom you get coronated. Maybe they should have shown this and how Kong ruled his kingdom. Was he a good king? Was he a benevolent despot like Frederick the Great? Or was he a bad king and getting drunk all the time like Val Kilmer in Macedonia?We don't know because the movie don't show this but I think it should because it is important to be a good king for the history books to remember you kindly.So I give it three stars because we just don't know how good a king he was (but then we don't know how bad a king he was either, so three stars is right in the middle of rating kings if we just don't know.)"
5,More than just the usual 'Girl Meets Ape' story.,"A classic. It's unbelievable at how well this film was made considering we were just entering the talkies era. The special effects were fantastic and matched anything we saw through the '70s. Great atmosphere created on Skull Island, which I believe is now a posh vacation resort, and the NYC scenes were great."
5,STILL THE BEST OF ALL TIME!,"This is my fourth video purchase of KING KONG. I bought this copy because I too thought that the famous spider scene would be included. (Oh Well!) KING KONG is still the best of all time!!! For the time period, the special effects are just awesome! I strongly recommend that if there is anyone who has not seen this video its a must see!"
4,King Kong DVC Digitally Reworked,"There has never been a remake of the 1933 King Kong movie that compares to the original version. This digitally reworked version has kept the accuracy of the original movie with added clarity of the picture. For any true ""Classic Movie Buff"" this movie will not disappoint you."
4,Best of the lot.,"There are quite a few DVD incarnations of the original KING KONG available. This must be the best. The features are top notch, and the transfer of the actual film is as good as we can expect. Don't worry about the Region 1 logo; my player indicates that these two discs are Region 0."
5,The most realistic of the All,"The movie industry has outdone itself in this classic Movie. The Beast was as real looking as the Star herself, Fray Wray. This has become my all time fwavorite. Keeps you on the edge of your seat."
5,"""The Eighth Wonder of the World""","More than 70 years since its initial release, ""King Kong"" (1933) remains the monster epic by which all other genre films are measured. Often remade yet never surpassed, it represents a one-of-a-kind landmark in cinema history, with remarkable visual effects by Willis O'Brien. Accept no substitutes!"
5,Great Transfer of a Classic,Loved the quality of the transfer. This movie was long overdue for release on DVD. I kinda suspected that it would be released in time for the new movie by Peter Jackson. I loved all the extras that were included. Highly Recommended Purchase
4,The KING has RETURNED!,The original KING KONG has great SFX for it day. I love it for its movie historical value.
4,Those Missing 3-Minutes !,"My critique is based on the 3-minute difference between the original theatrical release (c1933-34) and the sanitized/PC version. What has been post-production cut is a dialogue below decks between Armstrong & Wray wherein she uses the phrase, ""I'm free, white, and twenty-one."" It is curious that that is 'blipped' but they leave in the phrase several scenes later, ""Yeah, blondes are a little scarce around here."" Still, this endures as both classic and relevant entertainment."
1,king kong,I always been a great fan of the original king Kong film and had the original lazer disc which by the way is so much better than this low grade blu ray disc there is tooooo! much grain what a joke do not buy this !
1,Horrible Blu-ray Transfer,Avoid this blu-ray editon at all cost. The picture quality is so grainy that it is like looking at the film through a fog as thick as pea soup. Too bad KINO did not undertake the transfer. Warner has a history of poor and sloppy film transfers to DVD. And with today's technology there is no excuse for this careless blu-ray edition.
5,The Best,"King Kong is proably the best of the giant monster flicks. I mean, let's face it, Godzilla isn't really a very good movie. It's fun to watch, but it has a pretty bad plot, not to mention the bad voice-overs. King Kong on the other hand, has an epic plot. There's a reason why the last scene is one of the most well known images in movies anywhere. And, amazingly enough, King Kong still looks a lot more believable to me than most of the computer-animated movies we have now. Some of the effects are ingenious. Like the scene in Kong's lair where he's holding the woman. It was done by recording the lady in a gigantic arm (which is used throughout the picture along with a gigantic King-Kong face) and then rear-projecting that on a Kong-size scree and recording it with a Kong model with only one arm. Ingenious!"
5,"Classic movie, great extras","King Kong is a masterpiece of American cinema. This DVD is a great transfer of the film and the bonus features are extensive and informative. The detailed recreation of scenes (including the lost ""spider pit"" scene) by Peter Jackson's crew are an amazing look into how this film was made. To see how hard it was to recreate effects from the 30's with modern technology, it gives you a whole new level of respect for the original."
5,very surprised,"was very surprised and happy to see how well, they had restored the movie,,,I really enjoyed it again, the movie came in the condition they said it was, and I'll order again from them, thank you.........."
5,Definitive,"The first time I viewed King Kong was in 1955 with my father, who had seen it in its original release in 1933. ""When Kong's face first filled the screen, men threw their hands up over their faces and women swooned,"" my father remembered. Years later I saw it on the big screen at the Thalia on Manhattan's West Side (around 1970) and was newly thrilled by the detail otherwise lost, shrunken down to a television screen. The film has never lost its magic for me, and, now, complemented by the additional features on the second disc - the magic is revived again. The reconstruction/creation of the ""lost sequence"" of the fate of the sailors shaken off the tree into the spider pit is the stuff of which Kong-philes are made. An entire era is captured by Kong and its production: What an invitation to sensory overload around which to stretch one's thoughts."
3,Colorization makes for a different experience!,"I agree on most Black and White movies Colorization is a bad idea. But in the case of Kong I make a exception. In many cases the color enhances the wonderful ""matte backrounds"" of Skull Island and of New York City. Still I do believe that is not the best ""Colorization"" that could have been done. I do take two rating points away because of the use of pastel Colors and a slightly less sharp focus. Viewing it you will notice small details that you would never see in the original. I do want to make clear I see this as ""only a supplement"" to the Black and White film rather than a replacement. And prehaps as a versions of the film that those who ""hate"" Black and White images can enjoy."
5,Love the big monkey,Finding this is not easy. Had to have it. Now I've got it. Seller was very good & many thanks for the prompt delivery.
4,king kong,very satisfied with product it was just as i expected. amazon helped me in every way. i have recomended to everyone to use and buy movies from amazon.com keep up the good work
2,King Kong 1933,The film was grainy in some parts and not as sharp as I expected.I was dissatisfied with this purchased film.
2,Blu Kong???,"How does one create blu ray from old, grainy b & w? Blu ray is supposed to be pure and perfect sound and picture. And let's not forget that the original print is FULL FRAME! Na....don't buy this edition. Buy the standard dvd."
5,Question about the mail in poster offer.,Will the mail in poster offer be redeemable by people living outside the United States and/or Canada?
2,"Read on, and I'll explain the star rating I gave it. . .","Okay, here's my two cents worth-although this film is a classic, it's NOT that good in my eyes because all it is, is a big show-off of special-effects! Face it, if this movie was made today- it would be deemed the worst film ever! If it hadn't had such great special-effects than it would just be another old movie- it's not that good! It is a little enjoyable but there's so many scenes that's nothing but a show-off of special-effects and doesn't progress the story any. Yes, the acting is good- but the plot isn't that great. You gotta understand my point. . . this is only a short review because I've said what I think and that's exactly what I think."
2,Inaccuracy on dinosaurs!,"King Kong has many problems with it, especially when it came to dinosaurs! First, brontosaurs were not carnivoris, so why was one eating people in this movie? Second, just like it's spines, stegasaurus's tail spikes were made of bone, so why did they bend like rubber in this movie? Other problems with this movie include the claymation (Kong looked like an ape with a rubber suit of armor instead of hair), and when somebody falls and lands in water from that hight, they should be dead. I don't care how many people didn't find this review helpful, because this is not a classic (especially when the Godzilla series can easily be considered better), and anyone who thinks it is, is blind!"
1,Corny and over-rated B movie!,I really like classic movies from the 30's 40's etc but I personally found this movie to be incredibly bad with overacting and corny dialogue! The most over-rated B Movie ever!
5,You Will Always Be the King,The most moving love story of all time. I always enjoy KING KONG every time I see it. I grew up with it and saw it when it came out. I will never forget you Kong. The remakes are OK but this is the best and will always be the best.
4,King Kong,I felt that for a movie from the 1930's that the special effects were good. The movie is a favorite of my husbands and mine. I was actually very sorry to see Kong die.
1,Blu-ray transfer - Horrible!,"I love the original 1933 version of King Kong, and always will. This review is about the Blu-ray transfer and it's complete lack of quality. The horrible, grainy picture makes this wonderful classic film almost unbearable to watch. Especially if the scene takes place when it is dark or in the fog (when they ship out to the island). If the master copy of this film was not in good condition, then they never should have put this out for the public. I find it hard to believe that someone viewed this before production and said ""Yes,it looks fine! Let's put it out there!""Please remember, some films (especially older classics) for various reasons do not transfer well to Blu-ray. Unfortunately,this is the case with the classic King Kong."
1,WHAT THE FARK IS THIS?,"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????This movie is scary, totally fake, gross, black and white.....Have you ever seen a pee-wee's playhouse anamation?It's like that.Slow motion crooked not moving right horrible clay sculptures.Plus that lady Fray Wray screams waaay to much.ewwwwww.......Did I mention the blood?Kong stretches apart a huge crocodile's mouth and so it cracks...TONS OF BLOOD POURS OUT!also king kong squishes people by stepping on them and theirguts come out of their mouths."
5,Not just a movie...,"but a major event in American movie history. Friday evening, March 24, 1933, was when the motion picture changed forever. A movie with horror, romance, action, adventure, and full of trills. King Kong was a masterpiece of story and special effects and NOW it is back newly restored and digitally mastered with TONS of extras. Besides the commentary you can listen to during the movie there is a second disc full of features, from The Making of Kong to a documentary on RKO Radio Pictures, plus postcards, a 20 page reproduction of the original 1933 program and much more. Hours more!And the film has been restored - all the scenes that were cut out have been replaced!Pop the popcorn, dim the lights and enjoy one of the best movies EVER made. All in a cool tin!"
5,MY ALL TIME FAVORITE SCI-FI/HORROR!,"COULD SOMEONE PLEASE EMAIL ME AND TELL ME WHY THE US WOULD RELEASE A GODZILLA AND NOT THIS GREAT BEAST CALLED KING KONG? THIS KING IS AWESOME AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A GREAT HIGH TECH RE-RELEASE WITH A VERY ACTION PACKED ADVENTURE THEME LIKE THE LOST WORLD.BUT....HAVE THE KING LIVE AT THE END AND NOT NUCKED!!!!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE DISNEY'S JOE YOUNGCOULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY THEY HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO EVEN TRY TO RELEASE KING KONG ONTO DVD?????NOW I AM REALLY WAITING ON THIS TITLE TO HIT DVD WITH THE STOP MOTION ANIMATION TECHNIQUES AND INTERVIEWS, THE MAKING OF THE MOVIE AND ACTORS BIOS.WELL, THAT IS ALL FOR NOW....."
4,Very instructive and entertaining,"The documentary is awesome. The only issue that bothered me is that it features Bobby McFerrin on the cover, possibly misleading the costumer as regards the true content of this DVD, which includes some (mostly spoken) contributions of McFerrin, among many other scientists and musicians."
5,stimulating stuff,"The Music Instinct was a delight. I caught the last five minutes last July on a PBS public television broadcast and was simultaneously frustrated and intrigued at the eventual prospect of viewing it in its entirety once it got its proper release as a DVD. So just a few weeks ago I had the chance to see it. I watched it with a friend. She was blown away, as I was. Truly a ground-breaking program. Highly recommended.I teach at a LA public high school and the fact that music programs are being cut is heartbreaking in the light of the insights provided by this program."
2,"The less you know, the more you will like it.","There's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. This is a rambling series of interviews with musicians who know little about science and scientists who know little about music. Nothing is covered in sufficient detail to be meaningful and no conclusions are ever drawn. Whenever some cogent theory is developed, it is promptly dismissed with little explanation, such as the relation between the normal human voice and its musical intonations. Ironically, this was dismissed with a very musically intoned voice. The final straw was when they brought string theory from abstract physics into the mix. I then concluded they were just dragging this out to get a full 120 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone who has a weak background in both science and music. Otherwise, you may find the lack of focus rather annoying.It may be PBS but it is definitely not NOVA material."
5,Great Biblical Story!,I just finished this book last night and i loved it! I loved how in-depth it was and how everything was explained and described. It really brought the Bible and the story of Esther to life. I defintely recommend this book if you like books based on Bible storys.
1,Still Waiting...,I have yet to receive this product. I ordered it over a month ago and have contacted the seller (still waiting for reply).
2,Unseen,"I regret that this was a gift to a friend in the USA. As I live in South Africa I have not seen or read the book concerned, so am unable to make any comments.Johan Roos"
5,"This fall from ABC: ""The Bachelorette: Queen of Persia!""","Dozens of beautiful would-be royal hopefuls...one year...one night...one King. The catch: You have to impress the royal robes off the king in just one night...and if you're in the gilt shoes of Hadassah of Susa, you must hide that you're Jewish, because certain ancient tribes hate you and have slaughtered most of your family. Part tender love story (though a small part), part beautiful religious awakening, part palace thriller, and thoroughly a woman's heroic odyssey."
4,Lovely,"There are a few glitches, but they did not mar my enjoyment of this book. Terrific biblical fiction."
3,Interesting Read,"The book is an interesting read. It is a series, so you will need to read all in the series."
3,Good Story,"This is a wonderful story and well written. I would not go as far as to say that it is an enthralling read, but it was entertaining nonetheless."
5,Wonderfully crafted tale of Biblical history!,"The author gives an amazing recreation of the story of Esther. I was particularly impressed with how the story was tied to events that occurred 500 years before and Tenney did a great job of bringing it all together. If you've always enjoyed the book of Esther in the Bible, then this book is a must read.As for children, I understand there's a children's version or show them the VeggieTales take - ""The Girl Who Became Queen."""
4,review,i love the shape of it because it's so sharpe but the price is way to high for something like that
5,Johnny Dangerously,"Haven't seen this movie in 20 years, I remembered more then I thought I did & it's still funny!! you'll enjoy the jokes, & it'll teach you right from wrong in an enjoyable way too!!"
5,johnny dangerously,"I saw this movie many moons ago & enjoyed it very much.When I got it,I watched it again.I enjoyed it just as much.Very funny movie."
5,I don't care what anyone says. This is a great film!,"I think the only people that really bashed this film is Amazon themselves. They must be missing something. How many comedies do you know that can be thoroughly entertaining? Be about guns and crime, address the issues of sex, using funny metaphors to substitute ""swear words"", while still maintaining a simple PG-13 rating? This film is one of those great Saturday afternoon matinee classics. And with a wonderful charming cast.I like how Michael Keaton narrates the film and how he looks at or talks to the camera (the audience) to explain his particular predicaments. He's a victim of circumstances, however, a hoodlum with a big heart.From one scene to another, there are so many great one-liners to keep the audience entertained. Hell, I love this movie!I can't wait to see the Blu-Ray version come out someday. And what's more, I'm a strong advocate of the phrase: ""I love the 80's!"""
3,A little rough for PG,"I remember this movie from TV. Yup, still funny, but some scenes had been cut for TV or I didn't remember them.- An older lady responding to ""Do you wanna make some money"":'One at time or both of you together?""- Johnny's mom talking to his brother:'All you care about is humping....""Sometimes the movies you remember aren't quite like you remember. Memory lane has a few potholes."
4,Funny Movie by Michael Keaton,This movie may seem a bit corny to some; but I really like the comedy by Micheal Keaton and Joe Piscopo. Not a bad satire on gangster films.
4,Fargin' Hillarious!,"Johnny Dangerously still holds up well as one of the best comedies of the early to mid 80's. Starring Michael Keaton in perhaps his greatest comedic role, this is the story of gangster Johnny Dangerously. Johnny's basically a good guy who finds himself forced into a life of crime in order to pay to treat his mother's increasingly bizarre ailments. Marilu Henner is great as Johnny's love interest, Lil, while Peter Boyle is hilarious as mob boss Jocko Dundee. Griffin Dunne plays Johnny's naieve, optimistic brother, who follows a different path to the district attorney's office, and Joe Piscopo is at his funniest as rival gangster, Danny Vermin. All in all, this is a hilarious send-up of the classic gangster genre."
2,MEH,The DVD played well to start with. Then some 15 min into it the DVD wouldn't play anymore. I took the DVD out and could not see any visible signs of damage. I used a different DVD player thinking that might be the problem. The DVD still will not play. And it does not appear to be one section you can simply skip through. I will have to get a different DVD of this movie. :( However I did purchase used.
4,ditto,"As stated in my last review, I always make sure I love or really like a movie before I buy it."
2,Not as funny as I expected.,This was recommended by a person who saw it n the 80s as hilarious and it probably was considered funny n a shock kind of way back then. Adult humor. It had its moments but overall kind of boring to me. Would not recommend it.
4,Funny,"My husband loves this movie.Was used,but in great condition.It's really funny.Low price.Very happy with it.Would recommend everyone to see it."
4,extremely overlooked,"i have to admit that all a comedy needs to do for me is make me laugh. it doesnt have to be a great story or be completely dedicated to its subject matter as in a normal film. most comedys have a thinly veiled story with numerous jokes to keep the audience laughing and Johnny dangerously is one of those films. although the pinnacle of the film is the abuse of Roman Marone's foreign accent, there are so many other great jokes here. the acting is bad, and probably intentional since the fourth wall seems to be nonexistant and well thought out jokes make you laugh without thinking. they take advantage of their surroundings and the time frame of the film for some really hilarious moments. this may not be comedy royalty but its ten times funnier than some other spoofs by the Wayans Brothers (with the exception of Im Gonna Get you Sucka) or even the Hot Shots series."
5,An 80's CLASSIC!,"I saw this movie when I was about 8 or 9 years old. Ever since then, I have always loved it. I finally found this movie....not in Beta format, and I watch it constantly still!!The great grammer of Roman Moronie, helps me out when I can't be a potty mouth! ""Search The Somunna Betch!"""
3,"A classic, nonetheless","Not up there with Young Frankenstein or Blazing Saddles, as some have mentioned, but a funny movie. Also a very bad movie. It is so bad in spots, it's funny. Worth seeing just for the the taglines, especially the mangled cursing that is useful in so many situations, and the aforementioned Ma Kelly's ""I go both ways "" line."
1,"Old ,boaring,not much skin.",I was very disappointed with this video. It was almost like watching a Foreign film review. There is very little action and I feel I just threw $2.99 out the window. Do yourself a favor and skip seeing this one.
3,Tom was hot in this movie,"Actually, O. B. Tryggvason, a DVD version of this movie has been released (got mine at Walmart). That's how I got to know this movie. All in all, I think it's quite decent. On contrar, D. Mikels, considering this movie is only rated R (and not other adult categories), I would consider this movie quite steamy even for today's standard."
3,very youthful Tom Berenger,"I remembered this movie fondly from my youth and had only seen it once. Unfortunately it does not hold up on second viewing. Thin plot consisting of various sexual couplings and not much else. Setting not believable, Berenger miscast, even the musical score is not good. Skip it."
4,Very good novel,"Very good crime writing, I enjoyed reading this book very much. The theme of the story (drugs smuggling) evolves towards anti-American terrorism, which was somehow disappointing since there is enough fuss about that already. It was my first Ed McBain book and I'll certainly read more..."
4,"Money, Money, Money",Ed McBain (aka Evan Hunter) has always given us great thrillers with his 87th Precinct novels. This one is no exception. He does get away from the long explanations regarding who everybody is.With all the characters presented he gives us this can be a little boring. Especially for us who have followed the 87th for a long time. There are some great scenes between Steve and his family. There is also some humor as Ollie Weeks tries to get his book published. His fans will not be disappointed.
1,$17 for an 11-Year-Old Mystery Novel? Really?,"As much as I enjoy Ed McBain's multitude of 87th Precinct novels, I cannot fathom why the publisher set a price of $17 -- not four, not seven, but SEVENTEEN dollars -- for the Kindle edition of this particular novel, first published in 2001. I'm wondering if someone at Amazon's end made a keystroke error."
3,2small,The shoes are beautiful but are not true 2 small. It' a shame. I really liked the the shoes. Maybe Helle could make shoes more comparable to U.S sizes. It would sure be helpful before deciding to buy the shoes. I am sending them back. 2 bad !
5,70s Grooves for the year 2000,"Just when you thought soundtracks couldn't get any better, (The Best Man, Romeo Must Die, Love And Basketball, and Big Momma's House has already impressed us in late 99 and early 2000.) The ""Shaft (2000)"" soundtrack has been brought to us. With the exception of ""Theme From Shaft"" by Isaac Hayes, all of these songs were made this year, but most of them still have that 70s appeal to it. This example is clear in what I think are the best two songs on the soundtrack: R Kelly's ""Up And Outta Here"" and Donell Jones' ""Do What I Gotta Do"". R Kelly does it again with this song, ladies and gentlemen. You'll be reminded of his last double CD, after hearing this song. Other highlights on this soundtrack are: R Kelly's ""Bad Man"", Outkast and UGK's ""Tough Guy"", T.I.P. and Beanie Sigel's ""2 Glock 9's"" and Parle w/Jadakiss and Eve with ""Fix Me"". Anyone that likes new music with a 70s appeal to it, will love the ""Shaft (2000)"" soundtrack."
3,Donell Saves The Day,"I honestly don't think much of the soundtrack but it does showcase the immensely talented and smooth Donell Jones. This is one of the most slept on artists in the industry. Do what I gotta do is one of the best tracks that I've heard in a long, long time. Pick up the Where I wanna Be cd because is R and B with a bit of an edge."
1,WHAT'S THE SCORE!,"It's all good that people can purchase the music inspired by the movie SHAFT, but, I'm feeling a bit shafted at the moment. I don't really have an interest in the music inspired from the movie - I'm salivating for the David Arnold SCORE, not the soundtrack, but the SCORE. Hello Paramount? Where's the beef? Until then....."
3,Isaac Hayes is still better,I don't see the movie yet. It must have a special effects and better sound than the first film. But the soundtrack is not special. It's one more soundtracks that use the R&B stars only. Don't have a special idea. The 70's soudtrack was fresh. That's why I still prefer the old soundtrack.
4,Nice mix of music,"I enjoyed the cd immensely. I can't wait to see the movie. If it's anything like the soundtrack, it will be great."
1,not what I expected,"I love the theme song from Shaft and enjoyed the music that went along with movie, but I found the soundtrack to have songs not from the film. I wish more of the score went with the soundtrack and would hope that a Shaft score will follow."
2,I've been shafted!,"I LOVED the movie (like the old version) - and had hoped to bring home the bad-a**, seventies-style, action scene music. But the only resemblance this soundtrack could have to the BAD MUTHA shaft is if he gained 50 lbs, was sedated, and was forced to listen to easy-listening music. This PUT ME TO SLEEP - literally! The only redeeming point is isaac hayes."
3,Not the soundtrack,"Although the songs on this album are nice, and I thouroughly enjoy the album, it is NOT a soundtrack. What I wanted was the spectacular background music from the movie, which is great. This movie deserves another album of the actual music."
3,A bit Mixed Up,"This album has a bunch of good songs on it, but like most soundtracks, it does not flow in the slightest. It will be one hard, fast rap song, then a slow, quiet r&b song, and then another rap song. It's ok.....not that great. I don't know why half the songs are on here or why they are in that order."
2,Typical Run OF The Mill Music,"R.Kelly is the only Fresh Music on this Set.aside from Him Issac Hayes.the problem with Most Modern Day Music is that it has no Heart or Soul.the Original Soundtrack Kicks Major BOOTY!It would have been Tight in Additon Too R.Kelly&Angie Stone if The Roots,DJ QUik,Roy Hargrove,Stanley Jordan had have been on this or Rick James Or Roy Ayers.THis Set Misses The Mark Wide.that's The Real SHAFT HERE."
3,Good if...,"This is a really good download. However it's not one that I would have bought for myself. My 2yo grandson ""bought"" it for me! Needless to say my Kindle now has a lock on it! At least it wasn't Marlyn Manson or Lady Gaga."
2,NOT KENNY'S BEST,Frankly I am disappointed with this CD. I'm not sure why since all 21 songs were #1 hits.
5,one of my heros,I feel very proud to have met and worked with Kenny a talented and soulful singer and survivor I love all his recording and I'm more than happy to have this one.
3,Slight Chop Job,"I noticed that nearly every song on this CD has had maybe the last 3-5 seconds chopped. Im surprised noone has mentioned this, as it pretty much chops off the last chord of ""Lady"". The effect on most other songs is nearly unnoticeable though. And my god! Is that really the original recording of The Gambler? If it is, then they did an excellent job remastering it. It sounds legit so far to me. Save your money if possible though and get the Through The Years: A Retrospective box set which has everything this disc has (except ""Buy Me A Rose"") along with the #1's that didnt make this collection like ""Tomb of Unknown Love"" without the chop job at the end. Heck, the Retrospective box set sports just every one of his charted sings that I can think of all the way to 1997."
5,Kenny Rogers - 21 Number Ones,"The quality of this recording is excellent and includes some of the best of Kenny Rogers hits. If you are a Kenny Rogers fan, this is probably the ultimate disc to buy."
5,21 hits,I am a big Kenny Rogers fan and this CD has a great selection of his hits. I really enjoy it.
2,These are NOT the Original Recordings,"I missed the fine print somewhere but these are not the original recordings from the late 70s and early 80s, most are versions that were recorded in the 2000s.For me, Kenny's voice does not sound the same at all, he's occasionally hoarse, breaking, and cannot sing as strong and hit all the notes. For that reason, this CD is very dissapointing for me because it's not how I remembered the songs, and not the songs in their best form. For that reason, I don't even plan on donating the CD to the library. I think there are 2 songs that are originals, one is Islands in the Stream with Dolly Parton, which is outstanding, and you can clearly tell the difference. Please review and I'd recommend a different CD, though I'm not sure which currently."
3,Good Wrap Up,"I read the first book: If I Could. I liked the girl get togethers and loved the way Regina gave it to her friends when they all jumped on her but was sad to see another marriage fall apart. Reading Say Yes was a good wrap up but that really was all it was. Every relationship has it's struggles and Ms. Hill does a good job at showing the other side but I worry that some of the things that make a romance; passion, spontaneity and fire was lost in this story. Don't get me wrong passion was there but it felt more like old couple passion. Does that only make sense to me? There comes a time when the fire is still burning but it's lukewarm instead of hot. The struggles they went through Regina and her friends were real; past girlfriends, fear of submitting after divorce, adultery, self worth issues and children but maybe it was too real. Some people read romance novels to escape reality this book brings reality to your doorstep."
5,You can count on it,"I build wall-hung designs from exotic hardwoods, which involves gluing boards up edge-to-edge to make panels, gluing boards face to face, adding trim pieces, attaching carved pieces to the face of the design - you name it (you can see examples at Legacy Crests). Gorilla glue is my adhesive of choice for absolutely everything. It does squeeze out from between pieces, but once you get familiar with it you know the proper amount to use. Plus, a bit of squeeze-out lets you know that you haven't starved the joint. Trimming off the squeeze-out is no big deal, as the guy above points out. The only thing I don't use GG for is pieces that won't take clamping for one reason or another - then I recommend epoxy."
3,Tough glue - messy,"Pros:-Really tough glue-More flexible than super glue-Waterproof-Works on many surfaces, metals, wood, ceramics, some plastics, etc. Best for wood applications.Cons:-It expands, drips and produce tiny bubbles during the drying process. Definitely not for repairing your Lladros or others applications that require hairline precision.-Glue is not clear but yellow. Very noticeable, not good if you really want a clean finish.-Make sure you really clean the tip of the bottle or it will be hard to open and use it the next time-Not cheap"
3,Not that good,"Bought this after read good reviews here. But after a week of using it (did follow it's application instructions), I did not find it stronger than old Yellow glue, and it is not as easy to clean when it gets to your fingers. The shelf-life of this glue is 3 years but the manufacture date for the item I received is 2007. Not sure what to do with the big bottle (36oz); but I'm going back to the Yellow glue."
2,Very poor quality,"Difficult to use and the tip is very blunt, round instead of pointed making them near useless. For $6.12 what did I expect? Don't waste your time buying these."
2,Good show sabotaged by awful filmmaking.,"Just wanted to jump into the mix and say that this show was butchered by incomprehensible editing. I put this on for the first time at a party and everybody was put-off by the ultra fast cutting and weird choices of shots and angles. They cut away from Sheryl when she's singing and playing so many times that it just makes you wonder what' up!? Maybe she's so humble she wants her band members to get equal time. I don't need to see a two second cut-away to the drummers foot while she's singing All I wanna Do. The music sounded great-but C'mon, C'mon. We want to see Sheryl Crow!"
2,I'm sure they had good intentions....,"....but the editor and director dropped the ball in this DVD.WARNING: Mindless / senseless, pans, zooms, and rapid cuts throughout this DVD can cause motion sickness!!!!Did these guys just get out of motion picture school??? It seems that they had a list of every trick you could do with a camera and got to check off every one.....Editor Bullen and Director Atkins: get a copy of ""Concert for George"" - watch the full concert (not the Theatrical version)....absolutely beautiful!Sheryl - you deserve better.Otherwise, the music is perfect - clear, nice punch to it - great live mix."
2,Written by a musician.,"If you like the raw, somewhat confused atmosphere of a live concert, this DVD can provide that experience. If you like good production values...great camera work, smooth editing, and well engineered sound, you would be better off buying a studio-produced album. The band is adequate, everything is in tune, but the sound and video cutting are pretty rough. I watched/listened to this DVD twice, once on a very high-end computer with great speakers (hooked up to a Yamaha powered mixer, 220 W, full EQ) and once on my digital, stereo TV. Both times, the production problems were very distracting...sound flat, tinny, video editing very crude. Oh well, it only cost ten bucks."
3,A surprising disappointment.,"I love Sheryl Crow so much that it is difficult for me to be critical about anything she does.On this DVD, the performances are perfect, the lighting perfect, the audio perfect, the editing perfect, she looks absolutely gorgeous, the song selection is excellent, etc, etc, It's very, very polished... and that's the problem. It lacks any of the quirks or imperfections or tensions that give live performances their character and uniqueness.This DVD has zero spontaneity. Everything feels staged and controlled. It's almost like it's been scripted and blocked so that each member of the band is in the exact right spot at the exact right time so that the lighting and camera angle are perfect at every moment. At just the right moment, just the right shot of just the right audience members is edited in there.The whole thing feels more like a movie than a live rock concert."
4,Calling all Sheryl Crow fans,"I've heard all the critics review this DVD and yes the sound could of been a bit better with the DTS 5.1 but bottom line if you are a Sheryl Crow fan you are going to love this DVD. I have every CD of hers and both of her DVD's and Sheryl rocks! OH and yes she's very, very sexy too!"
1,Don't buy this DVD!!!!!!,"C'mon America 2003While the music quality and songs are great, the video quality stinks.The description says this is a wide-screen DVD but it is in an analog format. This means on that beautiful HDTV you have you will have a black top, bottom and sides. The DVD doesn't offer any other viewing method within the menu.The only way to view this in full wide-screen is to have and use the analog input into the TV and use the zoom function to get rid of the bars. This will make the picture grainy and hard to watch (no it's not my TV - I have a very high-end system).This was very disappointing since in the DVD literature it says the concert was filmed in HDTV. In fact, portions aired in HD on HD-NET a few months back. This is what prompted me to purchase.Very disappointing!"
5,Quality Production,"I'll keep it short, but this is a real quality production. Looks & sounds great. The DD 5.1 is as good as you could expect anything to sound. The cinematography is also quite good, with a few breaks which show the set up & road crew. These aren't obtrusive or obnoxious, like many DVDs I've seen. The road breaks fit it with the flow of things.This plays more like a ""concert film"" - not just a haphazard taping of a musician's performance. Some planning went into the film, and it shows.I'm happy because I thought the Globe DVD was awful & uninspired, but this round she nails it. Probably would appeal to even moderate Crow fans. For the money, there isn't a better current concert DVD release."
5,wonderful,"Living in Italy it's not easy to attend a Sheryl's live show for me but I've just finished to watch this wonderful DVD and I feel like I've been there in Ohio those magic nights! All is perfect, energic and surprising too (the man that wraps Sheryl with an U.S. flag...), the quality of video and audio is fantastic too and the backstage videos are very nice.I like the playlist too (my favourite: Everyday is a winding road with a shakin' Sheryl, I Shall Believe, Safe and Sound).There is also a new song (Let's get free).High recommended for all music fan not only to Sheryl's fans."
1,"Lousy audio, poor quality video. Spastic editing.","Lousy audio, poor quality video(it's not even anamorphic), The editing is spastic and annoying, must have been done by a 12 year old with ADD. The shots of Sheryl's big wide sweaty backside never seem to stop. Even the banter is immature and half-wit.Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Nothing new!,". . . I looked high and low to get a fitness DVD and I washighly disappointed with this compilation of Kathy Smith's previousworks. Since I am a Kathy Smith fan I already own every workoutsegment that is on this DVD. It is nice being able to forward quickly to the segments that I want to exercise with. But the cardio segment was from her Timesaver series and is definitely not my favorite, too dancy. Too bad they couldn't come up with any new material to add."
3,Kathy Smith,"The DVD format is good. You can easily create your own routine for the day by selecting which workout you want, warm up, cardio, upper or lower, etc.The cardio is very light, not long or hard enough. In addition, the ""time warp"" photography is really annoying when you are counting or watching their steps and all of a sudden you get a ""time warp"". Really throws me off balance. I had a hard time getting used to that.The upper and lower body workouts are very good. The lower body could have been longer.The abs workout is effective. When I can do it with ease, I'll just repeat it for a harder workout as it is only a mere 5 minutes.Overall, a decent workout when you combine the segments."
5,Kathy Smith's Personal Trainer,"I received this yesterday and I think it's great! I did the cardio portion of the DVD last night and MAN am I feeling the effects today! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a multiple workout DVD. It features cardio, toning, sculpting and even yoga! I also really like the portion for customizing your daily workouts. I think this is a great DVD."
2,Way too complicated,"I just attempted to work out to this video. It will definitely take me several more times to anticipate the moves and understand what the heck is going on. Plus, there are at least 10 people in the background who shout, hoot, ""woooh!"", and ""awww yeah"" at every new move Kathy does--this is extraordinarily annoying, especially if you're just trying to learn the steps. In general, I think once you get the hang of it, it will probably be a fun workout. Meanwhile, if perky, dopey people continuously shouting enthusiastically isn't your thing and sucks the motivation right out of you, I recommend something different, such as Denise Austin or Gilad."
2,Too confusing!,"This is the second Kathy Smith exercise tape I had ever bought. The first was Kathy Smith's Latin Rhythm Workout. I found the steps too complicated which made it unenjoyable so I never used it again after a few tries. But I thought it was just me not picking up on the dance steps. So I gave this dvd a try. Well!! I'm not a total spaz and it takes me time to pick up on certain more complicated moves, but I've been working out with exercise tapes for years so I am familiar with a lot of the steps and timing. But I got confused during the warm-up! Then I knew I was in trouble. I found the cardio portion way too complicated and hard to follow along. When your time is precious and you are trying to squeeze in a workout, it's a waste of time if you are stumbling around confused the entire time. I like Denise Austin's exercise tapes much better."
2,Seeing clips from old videos was very disappointing.,"I was very excited when I bought this Kathy Smith DVD until I tried it and found out that there were old routines from old videos that I never liked.However, I have purchased several other videos from Kathy Smith, such as ""Secrets of a Great Body: Lower/Upper Body Workout"" and ""Great Buns and Thighs Workout."" I lost 55 pounds in four months using all three of these videos from Kathy Smith. Those videos are priceless to me!!!"
4,Enjoyable!,This greatest hits album has a very nice mix of Rosemary's hits. Being on two cd's is inconvenient for driving. I have enjoyed this release very much.
3,Mathematical Physics,"This book tries to cover, (but not with success) the needed mathematics for learning or teaching Quantum Mechanics. The contains of a course in Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics must include mainly two branches of Mathematics: Group theory and Operator theory. The corresponded chapters in the book are short. This book, written in a high level, is difficult to be understood by undergraduate students. It is proper for postgraduates"
1,"Please do not read this book, ladies!!!","Ladies: the summary of this book is: All men are jerks! Pick your jerk! Hold on! He'll leave you because he's a lust filled maniac! Good luckThis book can be compared to a powerful drug: If used wisely by an intelligent, mature, emotionally stable couple, some limited, positive effects may be obtained. If it is used by those who are naive, ignorant, dysfunctional and foolish, however, the effects will be devastatingly destructive and toxic. (Ironically, it is the latter group for whom the book seems to be primarily intended).As others have noted in their reviews, there are far more valuable, insightful, helpful resources out there than ""Created to Be His Help Meet."" Why waste your time and money on it?"
1,Pure Evil,Misguided scripture. Arrogant tone. Name-calling. This book is very disturbing. My husband says it is the worst he has ever laid eyes on. DO NOT BUY!
2,disappointed,"This book has ""pearls"" of truth but poor reasons for the truth. The bible is taken out of context and the author is so extreme, unloving and harsh in her responses. I agree with her principles of biblical submission but there are much better books out there on the subject. I would reccomend authors such as Martha Peace, Susan Hunt, John Piper, Bryan Chapell and Douglas Wilson instead."
1,twisted views,"the author is articulate and interesting - unfortunately. besides having a skewed view of marriage, submission, and the husband-wife relationship (to say nothing of child rearing), she also builds on two erroneous Bible doctrines: pelagianism (original sin)and gnosticism (where matter is seen as evil).while there are thought-provoking issues discussed, and occasional good (even Biblical) advice, readers should study this book only if well-grounded in the scripture, their faith, knowledgeable in the area of heresy, and are unable to locate any other books on the subject.this book received one star ONLY because no stars isn't allowed."
2,Not my favorite,"This book has some helpful, biblical things in it. However, in my opinion, it includes more opinion and legalism than it does biblical truth."
1,"According to Debi, Women are NOT Equal","Debi specifically says that women's only role is be a helpmeet for me. Did you catch that? ONLY role. If you're an adult woman and you're not married, your life is pointless. And Debi tries to make women think this what God has to tell them.Debi encourages women to stay with their husbands even if they are being abused! Women are to obey their husbands IN ANYTHING (except doing something illegal, watching porn, or having anal sex). This is ridiculous. In fact, she tells women not to even question their husbands. Period.Debi tells women that they must have sex with their husbands at least every three days or so, or their husbands will cheat, and naturally so. This sounds remarkably similar to Afghan law which says women must have sex with their husbands every few days, and can't refuse.In summary, THIS BOOK TEACHES WOMEN TO BE DOORMATS. This is AWFUL. Women are equal to men, and have equal rights, but Debi doesn't seem to know this!"
1,"Horribly, Horribly Offensive!","I received this book as a gift and I felt it was not relevant to my life or my marriage at all! As many others have mentioned, you have to dig DEEP to glean insightful wisdom (for example, delighting in your husband). However, I was so offended by the author's judgmental tone and seeming disregard for a wife's well-being. By reading this book, one would think a marriage is about one person and his 'assistant'--not how my husband and I think of our marriage at all!I have no idea how this book has such a high rating as I would *never* recommend it to anyone to read. Granted, some bits (maybe a sentence or two per chapter) are worth reading, but you can get that in another, more well-reasoned and thoughtful book!"
3,OK,"She has some very good points, but comes across as crass and extreme one sided. You can get many useful pieces of info, but you have to get pass her attitude."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I read this book because a friend of mine who didn't have a good marriage read it, and it changed her marriage for the better. I thought my marriage was good, but it changed and was much better after reading this book!A close relative of mine was close to divorce, and after she read the book and start applying the principles, her marriage has changed dramatically! She and her husband are both amazed and happy! There is hope!"
5,All women need to read this!,"Debi, a mother and wife of over 30 years, shares information that our mother's should have taught us, but may not have even known themselves. This book could save your marriage...possibly before you even know it needs saving. In the least, this book will teach you how to be the best wife you can be. I learned so much from this book! I wish I could have read it way before I even got married. If you only read the part about the three types of men, it's well worth the cost; but this book is full of so many truths that few have the courage to tell. These are truths you can apply instantly to your life, leaving no room for grey areas. You'll not only learn more about marriage, but also about being a better mother and a better woman. I firmly believe that every woman needs to read this book! If you're responsible for raising a daughter, no other book will better prepare you to raise a Godly woman. Thank you Debi (and Michael) you've done it again :)"
1,This book nearly got a friend of mine killed,"I'm not a feminist or anything like that nor have I even ever been married, but a friend of mine followed all the advice in this book and continnued submitting to a husband who had put her in the hospital after beating her. I tried to get her some help, but she cited this book and said 'He is my head he has the right to do that.' She was saved by her loving parents who got her away from the creep. i think if she had not been reading this garbage, she would not have lost years of her life to that man. ""Husbands, LOVE YOUR WIVES AS CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH."" The Pearls seem to conveniently ignore this part of Holy Scripture. Ephesians 5 spends twice as much time telling husbands to love their wives as it does telling wives to submit. Evangelical culture needs to focus more on husbands loving wives."
4,"Overall, very good","As a pastor I can say that women in our church have read this book and it has helped them see in very practical terms some scriptural principles that are all too often overlooked or deliberately ignored. Quite honestly it has been a factor in some real transformation in some marriages in the church - leading to much happier wives, children and husbands.I give four stars not five because in one or two places Mrs Pearl, I believe, is unnecesarily frank about certain things; and in a few other places I think she should have developed or explained her statements a little better. However, the book will stay in our home and as a ministry we will continue to recommend it to women because overall it has borne wonderful fruit in the lives of people we know."
5,"The ones who dont like it, need it most!","I have had this book for several years. It was given to me by a friend, who wanted to know what I thought of it. She had given copies to several women going through issues with their husbands. She was hurt because some of those she gave it to, thinking it would help them, were offended. One woman even severed a friendship with my friend!( I think)I have read through it several times. Sure, some of the things Debi says are cutting. But, isn't that the way truth is to flesh? My honest opinion is, the women who are offended and angered by this book, need it the most! It's not easy, though. Husbands are not 100% to blame for every bad thing in a marriage, and Debi is great at pointing out the ways women do contribute negatively to failing relationships. If you want to know what you CAN DO to help your marriage, read this book. If you are looking for a book that will prop you up in a corner where you can ridicule your man, this is not the one for you."
2,Misleading,"I was given this book as a wedding present by a very well meaning friend. I believe that a man should be head of the household but this auhor is living a delusional fantasy world. This book seems like a guidebook for someone living in a 1950s sitcom or in ""Stepford"". Yes women should cok clean and care for children but, men also help. Many women work nowadays and you could never be a working wife and follow all of the rules in this book. I believe if I lived like her my life would be a living hell."
1,Be Careful,"Be very careful when reading this book. It contains some truth that is wrapped around some dangerous lies. The Pearls basically believe that men are gods, women are slaves, and children are dogs. Thus, men are to be worshiped, women are to be used and blamed, and children are to be switched until they respond to every order with blind, knee-jerk obedience."
1,created to be his help meet,"This is the absolute most bizarre book I have ever read in my life. It is full of wrong teaching, condemntion & namecalling to any who do not agree with her, judgemental, full of blanket generalizations, shame based, misleading, motivates by fear, legalistic, excuses mens sin issues, & promotes doormat women. Jesus came to set the captives free. He is life giving & releasing. One might say that there are a few good truths in this book. I say, there are hundreds of other sources to go to rather than muddle through the distortions and oppressiveness of this book trying to find a decent truth. I would recommend to find ANY other book. If I were Amazon, I wouldn't carry this book."
2,This book is great for setting up an abusive marriage,"I bought the book b/c I've seen so many contoversial reviews and wanted to read it for myself. To put the entire book in one sentence: A husband can do whatever the heck he wants- cheat, view porn, physically and emotionlly abuse the wife and children and they(the wife and children) must obey him, treat him like he's the best thing since sliced bread, and never, never need anything or have any feelings about his treatment of them. In my opinion, this book is just the kind of poison that Satan promotes- just enough truth to make a person stumble into his trap. Truly there are better resources out there. Don't waste your money on this book."
4,Lots of helpful advice but needs to be read with discernment,"I read this book with a group of other Christian women and we were all changed for the better by reading this book. While some people have asserted that Debi claims that women are to blame for probelms in a marriage, I did not find taht to be the case. She is simply addressing women about the issues they need to deal with. This isn't about your husband. It's about you, the wife. Even if he is a rotten husband, we are still called to be godly wives. Yes, that is very hard, but that is what God has called us to do! As we read through this book, we each admitted that we were treating our husbands better. We were encouraged to whine/sulk less and honor more. There were definitely a few times where we did not agree with what Debi said (Bathesheba being to blame with David's sin for instance), but overall, this was a great book and I would recommend it to every single wife out there."
2,Tone does not convey love of the Lord,"I'm a Christian married mother of 2. Although there is some good information about submitting to and honoring your husband, the author doesn't (in my opinion) write in a manner that shows she has the love of the Lord in her heart. Her description of single mothers was really disturbing as was the story about Sunny an abused, cheated on wife. This author comes across as harsh, uncompassionate and arrogant. I've actually prayed for this author which is about all I can do -- Hopefully she'll grow in tenderness."
1,Not my best gift. It caused a lot of grief.,"While this book has some good points, I would recommend seeing if your library has a copy before buying it. I read it, and then gave it to my wife to read. It did more harm than good to our relationship. If a woman has been in an abusive relationship before this book will most certainly put her back in a dark place. My wife never finished reading it and when I asked her her thoughts on the book, she said that the author was ""full of crap"". I gave it a single star on behalf of my wife. We also wound up getting rid of the book."
1,"No, Woman is Not Your Doormat","There are many many better books to read about how to be a good wife. This is not a good book, it just asks women to worship their husbands. At one point a stepdad sexually molests a his stepson and Debbie Pearl, while suggesting the mother have the pervert arrested, also suggests that she visit him in prison with cookies and a smile, staying married to him and waiting for him to come home. Sick. And I am a Christian, conservative, by the way."
5,"Great, wonderful, and a beautiful book.",Every woment should read this book. It is simply wonderful. Will make you think twice about life in general.
4,Point the finger,"I really like this book. I use it as a reference tool to give me practical real life examples of God's word in action. I like how I can look in the bible and read a scripture and then look at the same in ""created to be his Help Meet"" and see it put to practice. Thank you Debbie Pearl for your wisdom!"
4,Love it,Love it. It's different for sure but I think it's an eye opener.It's correction much needed.Don't let pride get in your way
5,"She knows what she's talking about, even if you don't want to believe it.","Read the book, loved it, bought 8 other copies to pass on to family and friend.Beware, there are some very conservative views of women's roles presented by Debi, but if you take the time to think about them, and especially if you try them out, you may experience a more rewarding marriage than you ever have before. In our post modern ""a woman can do anything a man can do"" world, it's hard to remember our God given ""created"" forms.I found that this book helped me to learn a more generous and lovely demeanor while also understanding my husband's needs and thoughts better. The change in me has resulted in a change in him, just as Debi says!The first time through I couldn't put it down. I had to skip the exercises in each chapter becuase I just wanted to know more and more. I'm now going through it a second time so I can do the guided reflection parts.So in a nutshell, YES, I LOVE IT."
1,Drivel,"I am a God fearing, Christian woman who strives to be the wife and mother that God wants me to be but this book did not help me on that journey. Despite hearing bad things about it, I went ahead and purchased it. Mrs. Pearl seems to think that every Godly Submissive wife needs to be a doormat. I also did not take to her description of ALL mental illness as a ""madness inflicted by God as a punishment."" I put the book down after I read that. It only showed her ignorance."
1,Run away from this,This book was truly frightening to me. I received it from a girlfriend I work with. I shudder to think a young woman could read this and think it was true!!The Pearls come across as nutty!
1,Beware - Dangerous Teacher of Abuse,"There are people who are convicted of child abuse that have gotten their doctrine from this person, so beware, her teaching can literally be dangerous.At the very least, if you insist on getting this book, also get others that will allow you to see more easily where she is not Scriptural."
1,"""Created to be His Doormat"" should be the revised title","Emotionally sick and twisted people will probably eat this up. Self-loathing has no bounds apparently. Anyone who needs to treat their spouse like a doormat is sick and twisted and anyone who needs to be treated like a doormat is sick and twisted. Apparently, there are a lot peas in the same pod in this legalistic cult they mistakenly call ""Christianity"". None of what they're advocating sounds Christ-like to me. It's because it isn't.The Pearls think that their advice for Christian marriage and child-raising (their other books) bear witness for Christ. I think that have it confused with Stockholm Syndrome. I think that their methods for Stockholm Syndrome are more effective than the ones who originally invented it. Good job, Pearls. You'd make good guillotine or public noose operators. The Dark Ages are calling you - they're running out of barbarians."
1,Not great advice for most married women...,"I know that some women just swear by this book, but a lot of what Mrs. Pearl talks about is simply unBiblical. Do a google search on this book and look for a blog by spunkyhomeschoolspot and you will see why there are some big problems with this book."
1,Don't get this book!,"Instead - get The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace. TEW is truly biblically based. Help Meet has many issues - most have been listed in other reviews. I will only add that you should do some research about the Pearls. Mr. Pearl feels that he is without sin - has been for several years - through a process of sinless santification. He even teaches a course so you can learn to be completely without sin as well! Where does that leave Grace? The Pearls are very ""anti-chrurch"" - they tend to raise the family unit to an idol - I could go on...see for yourself - google their names & you will get a wealth of info on them."
3,depends on your experience,"I recieved this book as a gift after I told about my depression and the difficulties in my marriage. (I have not finished it yet) Yes, it has good things to say. And it mostly interprets the Bible correctly (in my opinion). However, it can be very judgmental and harsh to women who are sincerely trying to follow God in their marriage. To see the book as less than wonderful does NOT make a person a raging feminist. The greatest detriment to my marriage and my motivation to be a Godly wife, was the teaching that the woman is ultimately responsible for her husband's behavior. For several years, I gave up trying to please my husband because there was absolutely nothing I could do to please him. Every marriage is different. Every wife and/or husband relate differently. This book is very narrow and legalistic - saying that if a woman is not behaving as the Pearls believe she should, she is far out of God's will. This is totally unbiblical."
1,Stay Away from This Book!!!!!,"I am a newly married young woman, honestly seeking to trust God and be the best wife I can possibly be for the amazing, wonderful husband that I have. I made it part way through this book before breaking down in tears. I felt so condemned. It wasn't conviction or encouragement - I was completely devastated. I am an outgoing girl, not the doormat Debi Pearl seems to be advocating. This book caused me to doubt my ability to be a good wife. I expected my husband to look at me, say ""You can't do this!"" and leave me after reading half of this book!Thankfully, my husband loves me completely. I love him completely. We both are trying to be God's love personified to each other. That's what we need to know. That's what we need to live in. My husband told me to throw the book away because it was so destructive to my way of thinking. It was such a relief.... and my marriage is glorious (despite having never finished this book!)"
5,Nice book,Got a lot of useful advices from this book. It is a very helpful book for the woman who are married or going to be married. Thank you!
5,Many valid points,"The author helps women understand the way we have been design and how it gives us a sense of fulfillment when we apply most it's of practical principles. It might challenge most modern society ideas of how women should respond to their husbands, hence it's reading can bring the common wife to examine and reflect on her day to day interactions with her spouse. Hopefully it will encourage you to bring about changes in your mind set and in your relationship. I know this has been the case with me. I am still single & believe you can always prepare yourself as much as possible before going into marriage. Obviously I can not apply everything in it's reading, but what little I have taken has brought many fruits not only in a increased trust and communication with my boyfriend but also in a more confident, peaceful and satisfied me. I've come from a very liberal mind set.I hope women who read it will have an and open mind yet keeping a balance and asking the Lord for direction."
5,Excellent!,"This is a very practical guide for experiencing a wonderful and meaningful marriage. Buy this book for a friend who is engaged to be married, or a woman who's been married for thirty years. These timeless principles fulfill a woman (and a man). An excellent read with longlasting results."
4,"Eat the meat, spit out the bones","Well, I recently got this book after being told it was wonderful. I will make this quick and simple.I believe Debi draws out some amazing points to really revolutionize a marriage. There were things that she wrote I could see in myself (that were less than perfect). And I did feel empowered to live as a 'help meet' that God has made me to be.The criticism I have is that though I believe the book is filled with truth, there is a clearly negative ""i have the corner on the market, it's my way or the highway"" approach in the writing.If you are one who can read books without getting wrongly condemned or feel shamed, but take away the truth where you need to hear it in a balanced way, then I do recommend this book.It's just not something I would read as though it's the whole truth, or if you have a hard time taking away the good stuff, and leaving the bad.Created to Be His Help Meet: Discover How God Can Make Your Marriage Glorious"
2,Conversation starter,"This book has a very interesting perspective. It is a good book to use in a group to create discussions, but not as complete biblical truth. There is lots of legalism from the author and the book is very derivative of Pearl's own feeling toward marriage. There are some good ideas, but lots of odd ones as well. This book is NOT for the feminist woman! She is very against working mothers."
1,horribly mislead christians!,"This book focuses on mostly the ""obey"" part of the marriage vows for the woman. There is some good points but mostly say submissive wives are the only way to have a happy marriage. They advocate in this and other books abusing your children, recommending to keep weapons in every room of the house and the car in the event your child acts like a child you can beat them quickly. Talk about misinterpreting the Bible!!! I am sure the Lord is disappointed in them as well. My sisters and I are burning their books in the fireplace later...seriously. Children have died due to their teachings. Do NOT buy this book!"
1,Be Careful of Other People's Interpretation of God's Plan for Marriage,There are plenty of other books out there that are uplifting and promote a HEALTHY relationship between husband and wives. My suggestion is to find those and read those. Husbands are not given a free pass in a marriage. Check out Patrick Morley and his Devotions for Couples and other books if you would like to build a strong marriage and not simply become a the authors version of what a wife should be.
2,dissappointed,"This book has some truth to it, however the reasoning for the truth is poor. Debi Pearl takes scripture out of context! (ex. pg 110) When she inserts her opinion, which is often, she is harsh, unloving and often just gives bad advice. It is unfortunate because there is truth to biblical submission and I would reccommed books from Susan Hunt, Martha Peace, Leslie Vernick, Douglas Wilson, John Piper, Wayne Grudem and Bryan Chappell instead. Avoid this one."
1,Complete Trash,I would never spend good money on SUCH TRASH written by Such haineous people as the pearls and one that negates the abuse of women and children shoudl have never been allowed to gain money on how to torture your children to death.
1,"Um, no.","I was given this book as a gift. I came home and spent a few hours reading it. My husband came home, flipped through the pages for a while, then he threw it away."
4,Created to Be His Help Meet: Discover How God Can Make Your Marriage Glorious,"I think this is a great tool to help any marriage. I don't totally agree with all that's being brought forward in this book, but feel that it can help any woman understand the true meaning of Submission."
5,Created to be his helpmeet,"It is a must read for all who are seeking a whole, healthy marriage. I don't agree with all of it but i take the good and leave the bad. It is excellent. She speaks the truth and backs it with the Word of God."
1,Bad Recipe,"If you knew a cookie was made with chocolate chips, sawdust, and manure, would you eat the cookie for the sake of the chocolate chips?Ladies, please find a better cookie that will truly nourish your soul and bless your marriage."
1,God's Will Indeed,"There are so many personal things I could say about this looney tune stuff. I will keep my review ambiguous and say thank God loved ones in my life have been able to pull themselves away from this crazy talk. There are those out there that use crap like this to manipulate and brainwash people, esp. when they are young and vulnerable. In the end, true love wins though and the BS is seen as it really is, isn't it? No one truly knows God's will or plan and if they try to convince you otherwise, run for the hills. Think for yourself. Follow true love and you can't go wrong."
5,Great Book!!!,"A friend recommended this book to me, but after reading the reviews I was skeptical.As I was reading it, I kept waiting to be offended, but was not. A lot of the points hit close to home, but it was much more helpful than anything. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to strenghthen their marriage or their walk with the Lord. I am 25 years old, so I have grown up in the unisex world. I wanted to be a submissive and feminine wife, but honestly didn't know how. This book really clarified when to be submissive and when to stand up against an issue.I enjoyed this book very much, and am glad I have it in my library."
4,book,"Good book, read with wisdom and discernment. And be a Berean and look up all the verses - some are misquoted. Otherwise good book. Arrived in perfect condition and a timely manner. Thank you!"
4,I'm a better wife ... and have a better marriage ...,"This is a MUST READ for wives and wives-to-be. I'm still not totally sure I agree with 100% of all she writes, but most of what I took issue with the first time I read through were areas I needed to fix anyhow! I am so glad that I found this book and that I have read it and am now more slowly re-reading it to get from it what God intends for me to. I am growing as a person and re-focusing my priorities, which in turn is making my marriage a more beautiful thing than it has been in the past and giving me so much excitement for the future."
1,Frightening,"I will not give an extremely long review of this book. It truly isn't worth it. This book is not worth the paper it used to print, and I am so thankful that I didn't pay for it, but borrowed it from someone else. The advice in this book is not simply ""outdated"" as some people claim the advice in books like Fascinating Womanhood (a decent book, in my opinion) to be, but it is ridiculous, and a lesson in nothing but humiliation for a woman. This is not about submitting to one's husband, but making oneself into a blathering idiot who makes no effort to think for herself in the slightest. This book actually made me sad to read. I hope no one out there reads this book and believes that God truly wants things this way. I consider myself to be a Christian, but I have not read this advice in scripture- anywhere."
1,Devastating results,"Without getting too personal, this book is majorly destructive to women that deeply want to love and serve the Lord. It strips her of everything she ever thought she could be. It gives men permission to use and abuse their wives. Run from the Pearls as fast as you can!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"As a naive woman in a serious dating relationship, this book was highly recommended as a book I should read to help prepare me for marriage. As a newlywed, I was given the book and finally sat down to read it. It has done nothing but frustrate and anger me. As many of the other reviews have stated, there is very little scripture supporting her wacky views and many times her advice is no different than something I would receive from my unbelieving co-workers. This is NOT the book to read as a young woman considering marriage, a newly married woman, or by any married woman at all. This book is more damaging then helpful. For those looking for an excellent book on being a Godly wife, I highly recommend Feminine Appeal by Carolyn Mahaney, wife of CJ Mahaney, the author of The Cross Centered Life."
5,Heavenly Marriage Advice!,"Created to be His Help Meet delivers real life answers to real life marriage problems. I never realized the damage I was doing to my husband, my marriage and even my children until I read this book. My ungodly behaviors and attitudes were stripped bare for me to see and I was forced to acknowledge that I had some changing to do.This book doesn't pretend that husbands are perfect and wives are always to blame for failed marriages. Quite the contrary! But the focus of this book is on the influence the woman has in her marriage relationship. Created to Be His Help Meet points a wife to the areas in her marriage where her behaviors and attitudes can help or hender.I have purchased extra copies to give to new brides and long time wives. I highly recommend it!CAUTION: The contents of this book may cause intense pain and brokenness when read with an open heart!"
1,Theological Errors abound,"I really do not know where to start on this one. I'll hit the systematic issues primarily. Most of this book is based on cultural preference rather than biblical principals. Her proof texts and scripture verse are typically out of context. Debi Pearl relies on what her husband says the Greek says in the Bible (some one please tell her that the O.T. was written in Hebrew and Aramaic)rather than doing the work herself. Also, her teaching women on how to make a petition to her husband is totally counter to how Matthew 18 says to deal with conflict and the whole idea of iron sharpening iron. One large concern is her reference to an abusive husband being a Mr. Commander gone wrong because of his wife!I cannot understand how this book is circulating among mainstream evangelicals."
2,Read with great discernment,"Although I agree with approximately 70% of the content, the other 30% overshadowed the positive. My concerns are:1. There is little mention of mercy and grace.2. The text is written in a very prideful and arrogant manner.3. Scripture is often twisted and used out of context to support Mrs. Pearl's opinion.4. The overarching theme is one of blame.5. The author uses the book to shamelessly promote her husband's books. It felt like a literary commercial at times.6. The author presents herself as knowing all there is to know of the male gender.7. The author presents her thoughts, interpretations and opinions as being the same as God's.8. A man's moral failings (as a husband and father) are presented as being the fault of his wife.Be very discerning in reading this book. There are some excellent points made in this text, my concern is the overarching attitude of the book. Be sure to know who you are in CHRIST and His grace before you read this book."
1,Evil,"Debi Pearl states that if your husband molests your children, you should call the authorities and ""have him do"" time in prison. Then, when he gets out, you should welcome him home with loving arms. Because ""God hates divorce without exception.""Let me get this straight. If I'm married to a man who HAS SEX with his own children, not only am I NOT to divorce him, I'm supposed to welcome him back as my husband?? Have sex with him as my husband?? That is sick. What kind of woman in her right mind could have sex with a man who screws children?Not to mention such a woman would deserve to be disowned by her own children. Can you imagine being a child molested by your father and then have your mother welcome him home? That is a slap in the face to all abused children.Do we really have to go on about all the other wrong points in this book? That's enough for me!"
5,Very good book to read,"If you want to know your place in your marriage, and know what type of man and how to treat him then this is for you."
2,WARNING!!!,"Mrs. Pearl has some good advice here... but unfortuantely the book is mired in much of the Pearl's doctrinal views to be of any good help to those with troubled marriages. She places the weight and burden of the entire marriage on the wife. No study on the one verse that husbands should ""love their wives as Christ loves the Church"" type of advice. I found Mrs. Pearl to be insensitive to those with legitimate problems and flippant or legalistic towards those who disagree or contradict their views. There are far better books to read if you want to improve your marriage... this book only stirs up debate and controversy."
1,"If he hits you, keep quiet. Glorify God with your silence.","You are less than him. Deal with it.You are to be under him. Why?You are weak. He needs to think he is strong. Remind him.You don't like how he handled something? Oh well.You need a break from the kids? No you don't.You want some time for caring for yourself? Wait until your oldest daughter can take care of the pile of siblings, and only if he says it's ok.You want to remember you exist, and would like others to respect you and treat you with dignity? Well, as long as you keep up the show and keep him happy, you can convince yourself to be content and fulfilled no matter what you really feel or your reality.All of the following are direct quotes from her book: A ""cheap office wench"", ""cheap office hussy"", ""lazy, complaining wife,"" ""cranky, demanding leech"", ""skinny swine"", ""rebellious"", or ""hillbilly ugly, which is worse than everyday ugly""... In or out of context... Really???"
2,Watered down linear algebra,"It won't help you pass a college Linear Algebra course.At least it didn't help me.Problem is that it's just too small to really go into any depth so all it's good for is if you need help memorizing the formulas for the determinant, eigenvalue,etc.If you don't understand the concepts behind all the formulas this book won't help at all!Then again I guess that's all it aims to do.Also some of the notation may vary from what you see in other linear algebra books.Schaum's Outline of Linear Algebra was a lot more helpful and it only cost a little more."
2,The Pilgrim Song,"I have read all of the House of Winslow series and enjoyed them. However, I thought this one was written in a completely different style, almost making it seem like it wasn't the same author. I thought it was written as an amateur would write. I found it more boring than the others in the series and it did not seem to have a plot. I will continue to read the others in the series, but I hope they are better than this one."
2,"Cheaply Made, Annoying Label","When I took this strainer out of the package, it had a sticker label with a bar code & product info, across the back. I couldn't take the sticker off all the way; it left pieces here and there, which were a real pain to remove all the way.This strainer looks really flimsy and cheaply made. Doesn't seem like something that will last very long.Also, it doesn't fit 100% perfectly into my Schumann Boston shaker, which is a bit disappointing.Aside from all that, I was able to make a few descent Manhattan cocktails with it."
4,Entertaining Album,Not something you can listen to every day but absolutely worth a listen none the less. Unusual musical arrangements but stunning production.
4,Very Good,"I like Has a Good Home more personally, but this album has some amazing tracks, the first 3 are really amazing."
4,Good melodic metal,"I started listening to Borknagar with their newest release Empiricism, and being thoroughly impressed with that, am now investing in the band's older work. This album features great music; a little less synthesized than the new project but seemingly lacking in some areas. ICS Vortex (now in Dimmu Borgir) is just a so-so vocalist in my opinion; he doesn't do the screams very well, and though his singing is good, Vintersorg's is better. But this still rocks. ""Invincible"" is the standout track for me. The drumming is great as well. Worth a gander if you're into black metal but aren't a goatsucker."
1,"Great music, horrible recording","Let me say it again: the one star is for the CD recording, not for the music. Ellington, his men, and Strayhorn's compositions are peerless. In fact, Ellington's arrangement of the last song Strayhorn ever wrote, ""Blood count,""(with a heart-breaking solo by Billy's close friend, Johnny Hodges) is alone almost worth the price of the album.However, I can't believe they let this recording out of the factory. In every cut, the trombone section is so badly mic-ed, and the trombone solos so faint, that it almost sounds like a music minus one recording--seriously minus. And at times, the piano is so loud it sounds like the rest of the band is in the room next door.I've never heard the original release, so, I don't where the problem is. But somehow I can't imagine that the studio engineers would have created a such a faulty master. I'm gong to look for a copy of the vinyl."
4,"Flawed, but infused with anguished tenderness","This is a recording made by jazzmen who may no longer have been in their technical prime, but their sense of grief, of an era passed, is palpable. The recordings of ""Day Dream"" and ""Lotus Blossum"" are a must -- and that makes this album a must, also.Footnote: A much earlier and dramatically different version of ""Day Dream"" appears in the movie ""The Human Stain"".This LP goes well with ""The Popular Duke Ellington."""
4,I understand somewhat.,"It would not take much for me to become like this. I do feel it's sad but in a small way I understand. Perhaps if I ever find my self all alone in this world I would retreat into films. Anyway, these people seem happy enough and thank god they have films. Films can be a very simple outlet for people who might otherwise be up to no good."
4,Obsessed with the Movies,"When does a hobby become an obsession? That's the question underlying Cinemania, a documentary about a group of New Yorkers whose lives revolve around going to the movies. The people in Cinemania are strange, interesting characters.Among others, viewers get to meet:- a man who intentionally constipates himself so that he won't miss any of his films and- a woman who obsessively collects movie ticket stubs. When one of the ticket takers desecrates her ticket stub, the woman gets into a fight with the ticket taker and is banned from the theater. Later, the woman dons a disguise and unsuccessfully attempts to sneak back into the theater.Cinemania is a great slice of life that lets viewers draw their own conclusions. I recommend it."
2,What's the Point?,"I love film, but I really didn't understand what this film was about. It follows a quintet of New Yorker film buffs but instead of painting their infatuation as romantic and wonderous, it reveals them as entirely disfunctional individuals who don't contribute anything, live on disability, and suffer from mental illness.I was hoping for more of a homage to film from the perspective of maybe it's most educated and animated viewers, instead of such a personal look into the lives of such a sad group of lonely adults living in poverty on the edge of eviction.If it was the intention of the filmmakers to illustrate avid film buffs as hopelessly depressed OCD patients, then I have to ask.. What's the point?"
3,What's in the Deluxe Edition?,"What makes this a ""Deluxe Edition""?? It appears to include the Blu-ray, DVD, and CD all in one package, but it would actually be cheaper to buy the discs separately. Is there anything special about the packaging or a book included that makes this worth 60 bucks?"
5,Duran Duran Diamond in the Mind,"Saw them in Durham NC on this tour and the DVD does not disappoint. Good mix of old and new songs sung with great energy. Really enjoyed the concert and this DVD. Able to show friends that did not go and see them live, what they missed."
3,Not what I expected.,This is an ok book but not what I expected and it certainly dose not do justice to Jackson Pollock. I am a huge Pollock fan and did not learn anything I didn't already know abot him from this book. The prints are ok but nothing special I was disappointed and will not ever buy another book in this series. Live and learn.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Reload is basically a spy/thriller type of story. Cue one assassination and one dead president. The story works back from there as to why it happens, and who did it.A man tasked to find the killer has to decided whether or not the assassin is in the right, given what he finds out, and the various politics motivations of the different parties in the book.Mek is a cyberpunk story, at its heart. Mek is short for mechanical augmentation, and when the founder/inventor of this sort of technology and society gets back involved much later, she finds it greatly different."
3,Disappointing but informative,"Althought the book has plenty of info on certain units, it seems to concentrate on the politics of Illinois during the war. There are plenty of units that aren't even mentioned in the book, even though I know that info is available. A good book, but seems a little incomplete."
1,Poorly written; not Christian,"The writing REALLY gets in the way. It's poorly done, repetitious, and very distracting. Also, the author advocates use of ANY religion for exorcism. I became disgusted with it, put it down, and couldn't pick it up again. Ed & Lorraine Warren's books are much better as is ""Beware the Night"" by Sarchie."
2,Paley deserves better,"I enjoy Paley's writings very much, and feel that Judith Arcana has unfortunately misconstrued in a curiously vigorous way. Paley's life is a fascinating one, and one hopes it will be told later by a more discerning critic."
4,Great volume!,"I have used this water bottle everyday now for about two weeks. I fill it up in the morning and take it to work with me with ice tea inside. I love how much liquid it holds, that it does not sweat on my desk, and that it is easy to clean. The only negative is that the 24 oz. water bottle does not fit in my car cup holder, but since it has a secure lid, this is not a huge concern for me."
2,Replacement parts not available,"I purchased the XLAUTO2 a couple of weeks ago. I used it to clean my car and it was satisfactory. Unfortunately I lost the crevice tool, which to me is a critical tool, and tried to buy a replacement from Oreck. I was told that replacement parts for the XLAUTO2 are not available. I now have an expensive product that is only partially useful. I want to warn other potential buyers about this problem."
3,Nice little portable vacume cleaner,"This is a nice little vacuum cleaner for use in a car, RV, or anywhere 12VDC is available. It works well, but could be more powerful. I suppose it does what it can on 12 volts with the current limitations of the cigarette lighter socket. I'm used to using a shop vac on the interior of my car. I bought the vacuum for use on trips when not by the big shop vac, and it does that job well."
3,Too many,"I've always liked JImmie since I saw him on a TV show years ago. However, there are too many of the same songs on some albums. I wish he would do a new album with songs he's never recorded before.I would love to hear him do some of Moon Mullican's and Bob Wills tunes. He does a great job on Jimmie Rodgers songs, but please do some stuff not done by him before."
5,Classic!,The condition of the book was great. It's the same version I read as a child and I am so glad I was able to re-read it to my friend's daughter.
5,Outrageously Funny,"I am surprised that the Wodehouse fans out there haven't reviewed this book. According to me this is one of his best works - Sam the sudden has an adorable protagonist Sam , and a host of quirky characters ""Hash"" the cook/friend , Kay the heroine , ""Soapy"" and ""Dolly"" the partners in crime , the cook ""Claire Lippet"" . The book is set in the suburbs unlike the city or the country as in most of other Wodehouse books. I liked the characters and the dialogues much more than the plot twists. The book is full of outrageously funny situations, but a rather predictable twist at the end. All said and done this one is well worth a read - just to know what ""Hash"" has to say about love and about Kay's picture."
2,"Very, very disappointing","I absolutely love both Sunlandic Twins and Hissing Fauna. This lil' EP has the charm of neither. It sounds half-finished, and the production pales in comparison to the full-length albums (as do the lyrics, for the most part). Don't waste your money."
3,Too long for very young children,"My pet peeve among children's books is when they are too darn LONG. It takes forever to read this one aloud as it is written, and my 4-year-old gets pretty bored. (Of course, your four-year-old's mileage may vary.) I usually make up a short, one or two sentence synopsis for each page, and ""read"" that instead of the long paragraph.Also the illustrations are just, well, funky-looking. They've got a strange, hard-edge, shadowy look that's nothing like the movie. The writers would have done a lot better to stick to movie cels, or else lighter, brighter caricatures.This one ended up in the ""hardly ever read it"" pile."
4,(no title),this is an awesome book that is based on an awesome movie. I love this awesome book it is great
3,Not for the easily distracted child,"My 3-year-old son picked this book up at the library. He's very interested in monsters right now and loves this movie, so I thought it would be a fun book to read with him. When we opened it up, the first thing I noticed was that it was very long, which is not ideal for his age because he gets bored easily. As I started reading the book, the writing style seemed more like a book review than an actual story. It's very dry and hard read in places because the words don't seem to flow well. It is adapted from the movie, so I can see why the writer would do that, but it doesn't make the book fun or interesting to read. It may be a good book for a new reader to practice their new skill, but not a good, fun story-telling book for a parent to interact with their children."
1,Boo Is Evil!!,"Poor Little Mike Is Harmed By Boo. I Personally Didin't Like The ""Mr. Bill-Like"" Incident When Boo Hurts Poor Mikey! It Wasn't Like We Expected. We Wanted A Quiet Book & Guess What?? It Went, ""Reeek!!!"" ""BWAAAH!!"" And Finally, When I Read It, Mike Was Hurt By Evil Boo!! :-..( Poor Monsters! If You Want Something Else, Buy Popeye From (...)!! (It's In Highland)"
4,Memorable,"One morning Effie wakes up and compares a picture of herself in her prime with the image in the mirror and wants to hide away. She feels useless.Only, neighborhood girl Amanda refuses to let Effie give up. Amanda pushes Effie to try one thing after another from caring for her cat to helping in the church office. But nothing seems a ""fit,"" leaving 82 year old Effie feeling more useless than ever--until Amanda takes Effie to school.This is a sensitively told story of lost and found acceptance and self-esteem through not only usefulness, but through the love and acceptance of others.Underscored with soft but rich illustrations, this story engages the reader drawing one back again and again. A beautifully told story for all generations.See other reviews at AUTHOR'S CHOICE REVIEWS http://www.ogmonthly.com/ff (NEW) and http://come.to/bookreviews"
4,Check this out!,"This album ROCKS! I recently heard a few of their tracks on a local radio station,(95.9/101.7)""the Z"". I really liked their music, and found out that 32 Leaves was going to be playing a local gig at one of the bars downtown. I went to the show and was just blown away. These guys sounded so good live. I met the whole band and watched the show. Not only was the music awesome, but all five guys in the band were the coolest. I definately recomend this album and this band."
4,"Very good, dark and melodic rock/metal album","Actually, the rock/metal descriptor might be a touch deceptive. Basically, this band takes a page from ""10 Years"", one of my all time favorite bands. Many of their songs aren't heavy at all (at least where distortion is concerned) and there is a definite focus on songwriting. While not as good as 10 Years in my opinion, they are worthy of a listening, and i jam then with some regularity. Let's just call this style a sub genre of nu-metal for ease of categorization (assuming one doesnt already exist). Not quite rock, not quite metal, not quite emo...but quite good."
5,happy somebody bought me this,never heard of them until about a year ago and very happy i took the time to listen to them
4,Great hard rock with hooks to kill,"Along with 10 Years: The Autumn Effect, this was one of my favorite heavy music releases of 2005. It still hasn't worn out it's place in my 'favorite cds' case. The only reason I didn't give this five stars was that I gave 10 Years 5 stars. And this isn't quite that good, but it still rocks hard and has plenty of memorable songs that you'll catch yourself humming or singing in the car or shower.This is a very solid debut album. They're flying under the radar a little bit cause they aren't on a major label, but count yourself lucky if you pick up this diamond in the rough. You won't be disappointed."
5,8 stars - better than excellent,"This book was written by a 1998 assistant professor; a newbee. But it was edited by William desmond , a true hegel scholar. A few points to begin with: the author actually ""emphasizes"" induction but truly presents a balanced approach reciprocating between deduction and induction. He presents the Hegelian ""middle"", rather than a slanted view. He presents the material logically and explains his interpretation of induction in a thorough manner. One extra big plus. You will find the very best commentary on ""master/slave"" presented in this book; truly superb. I loved this book and found it unique and interesting - and right down the middle. I'M GOING PAST THE 5 STARS HERE. I'M GOING 8 STARS ON THIS BOOK. It is beyond excellent. Wow and back in 1998 too."
3,disappointing,The movie is mostly about adults. The school children get under 10% of the screen time and have very few speaking parts. They are mostly in a mob looking out of train windows for example.
4,"One good movie, one bad","I'm a big Laurel and Hardy fan. When I saw this for sale, I had to get it. However, it only offers two movies; ""Utopia"" and ""Flying Deuces"". ""Flying Deuces"" is one the their better movies, while ""Utopia"" just plain stinks. ""Utopia"" is full of bad acting and a terrible storyline. I don't even know why they bothered to include that particular movie. Stan and Oliver only make about a 5 minute appearance and that's it...for the ENTIRE movie.I gave this DVD 4 stars because of ""Flying Deuces"". But I recommend staying away from this 'collection' and just buy ""Flying Deuces"" on its own."
5,Great foundation!!,"I was given a full-blooded bitch and did not really know alot about Rottweillers except for the preconceived notions of their viciousness. With smaller kids at home I was a little worried. But after reading this book and discovcering what a wonderful breed these dogs are, I am no longer worried and our puppy is doing awesome and I am learning alot every day. The book has great information about the Rottweiller breed and what to expect as well as great advice and techniques for training. Nicely written."
4,Great starting point for those wishing to own a Rottweiler,"This book really gets at the basics of preparing yourself and your home for the coming of a Rottweiler puppy. It gives great examples of what you should and should not do with your new pet, and has a lot of breed specific information for helping you understand your dog. It's an easy read for those of us who haven't had a new dog, or a puppy for that matter, in a long time."
2,You're watching a commercial.,"It is unfortunate that Tom Hanks gives such an excellent performance in such a huge waste of a movie. This is as much a commercial for Federal Express as it is a compelling character drama. The unrelenting product placement is too heavy handed and proved a major distraction from the story. I hated it! I give it two stars reluctantly. Both stars go to Tom Hanks performance, the rest of the movie is a waste!"
4,Powerful idea,"This is a good movie to be sure. To fully enjoy it you have to suspend any disbelief you might have of what would have really happened to Tom Hanks on that island. Example - severe vitamin deficiencies, major diseases....it really doesn't matter. It's just about the enjoyment of this movie. Hanks does a superb job and the physical transformation he goes through is simply stunning. I thought only DeNiro could make his body change that much! This movie is one to see on the big screen with an audience. You really catch the full effect of the hardships that way."
5,Excellent Quailty.. Excellent Movie..Double Thumbs Up,"Everytime I watched the epic of Tom Hanks; Castaway, it seems like the first time!It never stopped of being a really amazing... When Hanks finally leave island, but gets stranded in the middle of the endless ocean, loses Wilson, and succumbs to his destiny by throwing his raft's paddles away... you can see and feel how deep that thought was... and the message: Never Surrender unless you have done your VERY BEST,,and you might, still, get the best out of that!"
5,genial,Esta pelicula nos hace valorar las cosas que tenemos diariamente y no extranamos hasta que nos faltan. Me parece una excelente creacion y mantiene el interes del publico durante toda la pelicula a pesar de ser un solo actor la mayor parte del tiempo. No se la pierdan
2,Where's Gilligan when you need him?,"This movie is about 20 minutes too long. It drags, is uneven, and really goes nowhere. The one unique thing about it that I'll say is that when Hanks is first marooned on the island, there is never any musical score, thus giving you the feeling of his isolation. Very good and very haunting. Otherwise, there is no real explanation why he would stay on the island so long without trying to escape. An ok film, but not one that you'd want to watch again anytime soon."
4,This isn't Gilligan's Island,"I'm really not a huge fan of the big budget hollywood movie, but I have to say that Castaway was very well done. The most likely reason is the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis who continues to create quality motion pictures time after time. Tom Hanks gives one of his stronger performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex higher-up who gets stranded on a desolate island after his plane crashes. There is little dialogue during Hanks' time on the island, but it is not needed as Zemeckis tells his story through the camera. It becomes quite interesting to see the de-evolution of this man as he gets back to primal survival skills. Castaway is chock full of memorable moments and will stick to your ribs, it is a movie you will not soon forget."
5,Best Movie of the Year (or ever),"When I saw this movie in theaters I was blown away. Tom Hanks was amaising (he deffenetly should have won the oscar for best actor), and the special effects were so good at times I thought I was actually there. I would recommend this to anbody who can stand the sight off blood. I can't wait to buy it on DVD!"
2,Bad Ending,"I heard a lot of great reviews about this movie and, being a huge Tom Hanks fan, I couldn't wait to see it. So we went out and bought it, instead of renting it, and all I have to say is thank god it was on sale! When we first starting watching this movie I was completely in love with everything, the characters, the actors, the story line, the effects. Then came the scene where Chuck returns to meet his ex-girlfriend, Kelly. From this point on the movie started to go very sour. I felt that the ending left you with absolutely no answers. Aside from the fact that there is no way I would be married, with a child, after my ex-soon-to-have-been fiance was thought to be dead. Maybe, I would be in a serious relationship by then, but not married. And what was up with the very end of this movie? Did Chuck go make a new friend? Maybe I'm just not getting it, but I wasn't the only one."
4,I want that diet!,"Want to maximize profits? Publish the diet Tom Hanks had to go on to trim down for his ""after"" scenes. Other than that... it was okay. Not awe inspiring, not too bad but I was expecting a bigger island, longer survival scenerio etc... Helen hunt was good, didn't carry much over the top. But all in all, a mindless evening in front of the tube."
4,Great Movie - lots of fluff,"The Story, Graphics, Music, and Stars (all two of them, and one of them was appearently a very emerging actor that was rumored to have been contracted to act for the movie for $14.95) in any event, the movie is a must-see and will leave anyone who has enough time (2h 20m) with a sense of contentment that is harder and harder to get from movies these days. However, the 'Bonus' featues that load up the 2-Disc collectors set are a different story. They seem to be there just to take up space. Most are boring, not relevent, and way too long. A couple of the documentaries were intresting, but mainly a bunch of fluff. The bottom line is that unless you are a collector or something of the sort, buy just the 1-Disc edition with just the movie to save money."
4,Very solid and entertaining movie,"I picked ""Cast Away"" with some hesition = previouseffort by Zemeckis and Hanks - ""Forrest Gump"" wasannoying, calculated and syrupy feel-good movie thatwas constantly tugging your sleeve to nag you ""oh -please - feel TOUCHED by this movie"". ""Forrest Gump"" wasOK and entertaining - but emotionally did nothing for me.So I was pleasently surprized by ""Cast Away"" (which Ifinally watched on DVD). Zemeckis managed to keep thesentimental part under control and let the story unfoldand speak for itself (kudos for last scene!).Hanks acting and reality of the life on a small islandis done very, very well. I especially liked the distancesurrounding him after his return.It is a solid, entertaining movie that respects your IQand delivers the package. You finish it and you feel thatit left you bit richer and not wasted two hours of your life."
4,Tom Hanks In Castaway,"I enjoyed this movie.Over ViewTom Hanks (one of the best actors ever and my personal favorite) is Chuck who is a workaholic. During Xmas he decides to work and is shipwrecked. He has to survive and tries to get back home.Why it is good.It is a simple story. A majority of the film features Tom by himself on the island. He can hold the screen with no other actors, just by himself. Chuck's situation is a thought provoker. It makes you envision what you would do in his place and that life is not fair but you have to ""breath everyday"" and there is a bittersweet ending. There is a sweet message in the movie.Maybe not for everyone.Since Hanks is by himself a large part of the movie, there is not too much action sequence which might bore people."
3,A good watch but nothing more,"Cast Away is a good film, but not one that stays with for long. Tom Hanks plays the part well (he must be the actor of the decade) but the movie just lacks that little extra to lift it above the ordinary. The DVD is a nice compilation but the making of this movie just didn't inspire me. An enjoyable movie but one I'm not likely to see again or keep in my DVD collection."
1,Sadly boring ...,"Tom Hanks is a great talented actor. No doubt about that. He's great in Forrest Gump, Sleepless in Seattle, Big, Apollo 13... and lots more. But Cast Away is a waste of talent, seriously.The story is about Tom Hanks as a Federal Express officer who was very dedicated to his job. One night the flight that he took crashed in the middle of nowhere and he was the only survivor. And for the remaining of the movie, we'll see Tom Hanks talking to a volleyball named Wilson and making fire. He managed to get lots of stuff by opening the sealed packages that were to be delivered if not for the crash. Strangely, he spared one for no clear reason. I guess it was done so for the ending.The movie started well, but lost its direction. Some people may be able to endure watching Tom Hanks alone on an island for a couple of hours, but most people will find it dead boring.Story apart, the discs are well packaged, but I could not see why one wants to watch the movie more than once."
2,HYPE HYPE,"The crash scene was unbelievable , I found myself bored after the first hour. Perhaps I am not a cerebral person. I don't wish to see this movie again unless it's winter and on HBO"
1,"Another ""Perfect Storm"" That Drowns The Viewer","Tom Hanks is one of my all-time favorite actors, and when I heard how incredible he was in this incredible film, my boyfriend and I rented it on DVD. We were both very disappointed. I won't give away the ending to those who want to see it, but let me put it this way: 1. The only thing good about the film is the great computer graphics. 2. Helen Hunt appears, disappears for four years, then returns, and we have NO idea what happened to her in between. 3. The acting is more humorous than serious or dramatic. I laughed more than anything watching this. 4. The ending is dumb. But these are my opinions. Hopefully others will think the movie is as great as it was blown up to be."
1,I like Tom Hanks but this movie was horrible!,"My wife and I watched this together and both have very different tastes in movies, we both agreed this was one of the most boring thoughtless movies ever made. I've seen triumphant dramas that had much more substance and a well conceived plot. This could have been written by a 11 year old. Just my opinion..."
1,Slow-moving movie with badly written characters,"After 30 minutes into the movie I was hoping Tom Hanks would starve or suffer from eating something poisonous. This movie didn't engage me at all. I had no respect for the main character. I did not feel connected at all. The tv-show Survivor had more drama in it !!Now for something that really bothered me : why the hell did he hold on to the last box for so long !! They could have saved the movie by having him open the box after coming back to the civilised world and having it contain a letter-bomb !!!Tom Hanks should be ashamed of himself. He played this role like he played most others. Just by loosing 30 pounds, doesn't make you a good actor, Mr. Hanks.If you want to see a good, spiritual Zemeckis film try Forrest Gump or Contact."
1,Should've been Cast Away,"WHAT A BORING MOVIE! Tom Hanks character was not likable. There was no emotion whatsoever. This was one script that should've been Cast Away. Only 1 star and that star goes to Lari White, the country singer who play the Angel sculptress. Shame on Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt for accepting the roles in this poor poor pitiful me story. If they had reversed some of the story by doing flashbacks with developing the relationship between Hunt and Hanks would have brought some emotion to the movie and made it somewhat enjoyable. I saw this for free is a sneak preview and my time was wasted. I like Tome Hanks and Helen Hunt and they are two of my favorite stars today. Oh well life goes on doesn't it Wilson?"
1,castaway,Had to stop halfway through due to an emergency. Next day i still had time in the rental but it would not let me watch it. Not happy
4,Its Grrreat!,"I gave it 4 stars because I took 1 star away for its ending. I am a sucker for happy ending. The ending could have been done better...The crash scene was very well film. The acting was superb all around. The film was all Tom Hanks. He was either going to make it or break the film. Going with Tom, was the smart move. I was expecting more from Helen Hunt. Could have use any female actor to do that role and save some bucks there. It is a THUMBS UP! Got to have for your Tom Hanks' collection."
4,Primal,"Cast Away is an entertaining movie about an extremely punctual man who gets stranded on an island. The move has some really great moments. It is great to see how Tom Hanks must adapt to his environment. This is no tropical paradise, but more of a tip of a mountain sticking out of the ocean. The only complaint about the film is the length. The first section could have been shorter, more island scenes, and drastically cut out the end. I just want a good survival movie, so the character builing story of the him and the girl does not appeal too me. This is an entertaining movie."
3,"Doesn't measure up to my hopes, but it does ""hook"" me in.","I too am a believer that this film could have been much better. Here's my main problem with it. Even for those who have yet to see it, you already know that Tom Hanks has apparently been stranded on an island and (due to the nature of Hollywood scripts) it's safe to assume that he will at some point be rescued. But do you get to see the manner in which he is rescued? Do you get to see him engage in his first human contact in over four years when he gets rescued? NO, YOU DON'T! You sit through this long and quiet movie, hoping for a wonderous rescue, and you don't get it. Quite simply, I don't understand it. I do think though that Tom Hanks' peformance is great, and his struggle on the island is very compelling. I just can't believe how this movie builds you up to such a high point, and then it comes crashing down with a big thud."
4,A must see,"A must see if you have never seen it, but once you have been through it, once is enough!!! Tom Hanks is always believable in everything he does."
4,Blu-ray worthy,"The movie is well known so I will just state I was very happy with the picture/sound on this disc as others have stated. Was nice to revisit the movie, not sure how many times one would want to replay it but it has some great demo scenes!"
2,More like a commercial,"I went to this movie because I'm a Hanks fan. First I like to say that the sound of this movie is great, but thats (almost)all. The first half hour is one big FedEx commercial. Then there is the plane crash, that one is really great, I think the second best (I think the best is in Final Destination). Only.....you can see that the plane which crashes is a boeing 777, and..............those do NOT crash. I think that Tom Hanks is great, but I think he will never be as good as Forrest Gump."
2,A So-So Film That Could Have Been Great,"""Castaway"" is what I consider a flawed film. Sure,the moments on the island are wonderful, but it doesn't hide the factthat the plot and motivation of the movie is weak. Tom Hanks is goodin his role (but has he ever been bad in a movie in the last decade)but the other actors in the film are delegated to underdeveloped minorcharacters. They serve no more purpose than for them to just bethere. It surprises me that this film is so hailed as a cinematicexperience. The script is non-existent, the directing by RobertZemeckis, who has shown his extrodinary talent in other films, ismerely adequate, and an ending which strains credibility. Perhaps thefilm's main problem is that it glosses over the relationships that TomHanks's character has with the other characters with short,unsatisfactory bookends. For me, the film left me thinking there wasa greater film somewhere, but instead, I just saw a film that showedthe highlights."
2,No meat...,"The only movie Tom stars in which we were dissapointed to see. Nothing to the story. We walked away feeling like ""I don't get it"""
3,Cast Away from your shopping cart,"""Cast Away"" left me feeling very shortchanged. At first, I thought the movie was hilarious, but then it takes a very serious turn. The dynamic that Hanks displays throughout the movie is incredible: the definite bright spot. But, there is not a whole lot of progression, development, or action. For those who are looking for an exciting survival story, this is NOT your movie. I find it odd that Hanks knew how to do everything necessary for survival. I did enjoy this movie, but overall, it is depressing, leaving a sour taste in my mouth at the wrong point in the movie: the end."
1,"Tom Hanks on a deserted island, guess what happens?","Anything you can imagine happening on a deserted island, that's what. Very predictable and, while I think Tom Hanks is great, this is just him being Tom Hanks on a tropical island, so what if he gained weight and grew his hair out for the role? Sorry, but I just found this movie irritating. Don't get me started about Helen Hunt - talk about lack of chemistry."
1,A FED-EX COMMERCIAL,"The movie was fine. Good. Okay. Whatever. But if I had known it was a Fed-Ex commercial, I would have avoided it. Whatever happened to making up company names so that you don't become a SELL-OUT? Go ahead, try to watch this movie and ignore FED-EX continually flashing in your face. Believe me, they did NOT have to do it. All it does is distract and disrupt to make them MORE MONEY that they DON'T NEED. I say: DON'T SEE IT ON PRINCIPLE. This movie isn't good enough to be worth supporting a sell-out. I gave it one star to make a dent in the ratings, but without the Fed-Ex, it's maybe a two & a half."
1,Boring!!!,"My god i am tired. Let me just close my eyes. Dam this film is still on. If you know any thing about films, do not see this film! I will say it is an interesting idea, but poo cakes are an interesting idea, but it does not work. The film is long, so very long of, well...nothing. I am able to watch most films, but I had to fastforward and get to the end, even watching the film at speed is boring. If you have trouble sleeping, get this!"
2,Ruined in a brief moment of stupidity,"Unless there's some significance to Chuck Noland being stranded for 4 years, why was it necessary to display the graphic stating the amount of time that passed? Whether it's 2 years, 4 years or 10 years, you can tell by looking at the character that a lengthy period has elapsed.Actually, considering how our society needs it's information simplified and spoon-fed, I should be happy it wasn't worse. There could have been an off screen narrator.""Now children, Mr. Noland has been on the island a LOOOOOOONG time and has grown very skinny.""The audience should be trusted to reach some conclusions on their own."
1,First of all I would like to warn you,"I thought that this movie was terrible. Why? Well, the movie went nowhere, told us nothing, and was nothing but one guy talking to a volleyball. Sound exciting? I mean, even if you like Tom Hanks it wouldn't bring up the quality of the movie. The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the ""undelivered package,"" which really means nothing held it together. Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they ""like"" it will show it to you for free. It is not worth the money, and I saw it in theatres!"
2,Too much monologue...,This movie is about a south pacific islander hermit that goes to the USA to track down two women for various reasons. I disliked that the gentlemen had so much monologue with himself and a soccer ball on the island. I believe this film would have been much better had the movie been shot similarly to the 1988 masterpiece Missing Link. If I could give it two and a half stars I would.
2,"Boring movie, annoying script and actors.","Just not a good movie. Starts off okay but once Hanks is on the island for a while it just becomes uninteresting. And once he returns to civilization it gets even more boring. Finally, the ending is pathetically bad. It's okay guys, you don't have to like every movie Tom Hanks is in. Helen Hunt is brutal in this movie."
2,Rescued too soon,"Not quite what I expected. Yes, the film wants to be about more than Robinson Crusoe, thus the emotional/relationship drama is given much more space than expected ... but that's not we went to see. Whether the symbolism of the title works on more than one level is clever, but the fact that it wasn't emphasized in the trailers seems to say that the producers knew that the moviegoing public wasn't too interested in that aspect either.The first half of the movie works, and we identify with Hanks' character, and begin to ask ourselves how we would have fared, and all the comforts we take for granted ... but before we can witness more of his transformation from hapless modern man to wizened hunter-gatherer, he is rescued.Then the second part of the movie begins ... but do we really care?Spectacular environmental effects, and sense of isolation and aloneness ... if only there were more."
4,Something very weird about this movie...,"Did anybody else notice something strange about this movie? I've been in the kinds of places where most of the scenes of Castaway are set. Tropical islands, beaches, coral reefs. There are always birds, birds, birds everywhere. I don't remember a single bird in the entire movie. Not a gull; not a tern; not a sanderling. In fact no wildlife at all other than some kind of silly lizard and a porpoise. Did they not want to pay off the animal rights loonies or what?I did enjoy the movie. Much better than average."
5,Cast Away,"Video arrived sooner than I'd expected and in excelent condition, like brand new. We watched the movie last night and throughly enjoy the performance given by the entire cast but especially by Tom Hanks."
3,"Good movie, but not so compelling","Cast Away is a good movie, but not so compelling.The script is pretty much predicable.Of course, the main character must be rescued.The only question, will he get his girl back?I wont spoil the ending for you."
3,The best bits gone,"Hanks - great. Special effects and cinematography - great. But the two things that I want to see in this movie were card titles: 4 years later and 3 weeks later. I wanted to watch Hanks evolve on that island, not jump ahead. And Lord how I wanted to see those first 3 weeks off the island!!!Ultimately entertaining, but not as though provoking as it could be. DVD is noteworthy for the extras - and for finding out the script went through 150 rewrites!"
4,OK but a little long!,"This film could have been a lot shorter and than I would have liked it more. As usual Tom Hanks is great and does an excellent perfomance once he lands on the island. However, there are a few flaws in this movie that could have been approached differently. For example the scene at the end of the movie was a little to weird for me and not very credible. On the overall scale it does make one appreciate every moment of life as we never know what tomorrow will bring. Unlike ""The Blue Lagoon"" filmed years ago this protrays man in a truer sense of abandonment on an Island all alone with no one to talk to. It makes you wonder how he was motivated to get up every morning."
4,"Good Movie, not great","It was a good movie, but there are tiny flaws that can be overlooked by Tom Hanks performance. I do agree with the Oscar for Best Actor Going to Russell Crowe, but that doesn't take away from the brilliant performance of Tom Hanks."
4,WHAT ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE ENDING?,"Movie: 4.5 StarsSound: DD (4 Stars), DTS (5 Stars)DVD Extras 3.5 StarsI have read in various entertainment articles back when Cast Away first premiered in December of 2000, that Zemeckis's original ending had Hanks and Hunt ending up together at the end of the movie, but after careful thought and test screening, Zemeckis threw that ending away and reshot the ending that we know of today. Zemeckis thought that Hanks and Hunt becoming lovers again after all that time would not seem believable by the audience, so he changed it to reflect a more realistic ending of Hanks moving on with life.My question is, where is this ""alternative ending""? Does it exist? If it does, isn't that why DVD's exist? To include those deleted shots and endings that we all crave! Therefore, without the alternative ending, the extras get 3.5 stars from me. Overall DVD, 4 Stars."
5,Good movie...,"I liked Wilson! This movie was good, but since there was so little dialouge, there should have been more music to keep it from getting too boring."
2,review,"The movie is about a guy that gets stranded on a desert island: that's a new concept!! If you didn't see any of the other 200,000 movies about guys alone, or with beautiful girls, or with a group of people that turn cannibals when stranded on a desert island, then go see this. I am trying to second guess Zemeckis here and what I think he was thinking was to let the scenery do the talking, let the spectator become the guy on the island. I say this because things happen on the island that I either didn't see or didn't notice and that are explained in a brief monologue toward the end of the movie. What I like the most about the movie is definitely the island. An unbelievable place, a desolate, out of this world beauty and a prison from which there is (almost) no excape. I suppose if you have the latest progressive scan TV technology or a 40k projector and screen you can probably add this CD to your collection and file under exotic vacations."
3,Castaway the beginning and end and stick with the middle,The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are very generic but then once he get's on the plane this is when the movie really take's off . The island scene's were not only well shot but Hank's performance was truly wonderful . It is sad that everyone else in this movie is really weak . what does it say when the 2nd best performance in a movie is done by a volleyball
3,WARNING DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!!,"My hat goes off to Mr. Tom Hanks. I am a huge fan of his and thought he did a tromendous job in this film. I can't say enough for Tom Hanks, he is truly a brilliant actor. HOWEVER! Hellen Hunt's character can't wait for him? What the hell is that all about? ""I knew you were alive. . . I always loved you"" What is that supposed to mean? You knew I was alive and loved me when you got married and had a kid within 1 year after I disappeared? I could understand if she waited like 3 or 5 years and then had to move on but she was movin on within like 3 months. That really ruined the movie for me! But the acting is worth buying it for."
2,Vote This Video Out Of Your VCR,"Tom Hanks is a great actor, but watching him talk to himself for all that time almost made me wish he had hung himself in the movie, which should have saved me at least a good 35 minutes of my life wasted watching this movie. It was a good concept, but the final execution of watching Hanks and Wilson the Volleyball survive all those years on the island to have the moral of the story be that time marches on whether your around or not...let's just say it was a letdown."
3,Hanks saves the film,"There some good things in Cast Away take Tom Hank's performance for example but that it's it. The rest of the cast isn't in the film long enough for one to get a vibe of how they would have acted. For over an hour there's no dialouge jsut Hanks standing around. If you're a Hanks fanatic then this is the movie for you, otherwise stay away."
3,KEEP THE MIDDLE -- CAST AWAY THE REST!,"CAST AWAY is a little slow starting, a great movie once they get Tom Hanks onto the island and then peters out at the end. In the beginning, it's a little tough to buy Hanks as an driven, time-obsessed, Type-A personality businessman, but he comes across well as a modern Everyman surviving on a desert island. There is a good deal of humor and a number of ""Cool Idea!"" moments. The ending deals with his return to civilization. Kudos for trying to show this readjustment, but the attempt to show CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is heavy-handed and his situation on returning strikes me as unrealistic: Where are his friends and family?A good try, but a bit overambitious. There is a lot to be learned from a plain ""stranded on a desert island"" movie; no point is weighing it down with too much setup and conclusion."
5,Emotional Movie,"This movie is very emotional and a great watch if you're up for a good cry or if you just need to get some perspective in life. Overall, a very good movie. ;)"
5,Incredible movie,Tom hanks is a amazing actor and there aren't to many actor's and actress that could have pulled this part off and as for the how the blue ray looks it's amazing with all the iconic scene's in the movie
3,good but...,This movie was very good. Man deserted on island. He survives for years and finally goes back home. One thing though is that I just don't understand the ending. I wish the ending was as good as the rest of the film.
3,Ending ruined the movie,"Most of the movie is brillant in showing how Hank's character adapts to his surroundings and goes through his own personal turmoil of loneliness (even when Wilson is no longer enough). However, the ending is incredibly sappy in just trying to go along with the movie's title. With the way that Hank's character had developed, it is not believable how the movie ended."
3,good,good movie the first time but after having to watch it 4 times it gets kinda boring. the movie is very long and some times very tedious. It actually deserves more like a 3 1/2
3,What's the message?,"This movie strives to give some profound message but aside from a few platitudes and the Fed Ex placement ads I can't figure out what it is.There are some poignant moments when Tom Hanks'character is on the deserted island with his only friend,a volleyball courtesy of a fed ex package.After 4 years Hanks character manages to piece together a raft and drifts until a ship spots him and picks him up.Back in civilization you expect the character to experience an epiphany of some sort but nothing happens.This movie tried too hard to be earnest but really had nothing to say.Ambitious yes,but a very disappointing movie."
5,The Middle and the End,"Everyone who has seen the trailer, I suppose, knows that he makes it back at the end of the film -- which many viewers didn't like. I would offer an observation that not many have mentioned. There are two scenes in the movie in which Hanks' character looks in each of the cardinal directions. The first of these occurs at the top of the island: he looks north, south, east, and west... seeing nothing except water. He is alone on the island, and there is no solace. The second of the two occurs near the end of the film at the crossroads: he looks again in each direction and sees nothing but land. Loneliness in all but one direction, and that is the direction he settles on. I don't think this was thrown in as the Hollywood crowd-pleaser... this ending had some depth."
5,"""I'm sorry, Wilson!""","If you know what the title of my review means, then you've seen the movie. And you know it is good: adventure, action, escape, burdens, lost loves, and survival under harsh circumstances. This is a mix of Robinson Caruso and The Count of Monte Cristo (while Dante is in prison).Federal Express manager Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is shipwrecked for four years. This story related to his life before, during, and after. And believe it or not, at the very end, I'll bet you will be wondering about the next chapter as well.Cast Away is a movie investment... you'll want to see it about every third year."
3,Still Questioning,"While there is no denying that Tom Hanks is a fine, fine actor and that this movie, on some level, was moving and significant it left me with no feeling. I walked away from the film feeling neither upset, excited, content, nor with any closure. It failed to evoke any inner turmoil in me - and truly, isn't that what a successful piece of film should do? Any successful piece of art?The graphics were magnificent, and the plot could have gone somewhere, but it seemed to die somewhere on the island. Tom Hanks returns home and... he can immediatly drive again? Feels totally comfortable around people? No anxiety issues about returning to work? Realistically, I think that the writers and directors skipped what could have been the more emotionally defining portion of the film.Almost all three stars are for Mr. Hanks' wonderful performance."
2,just the movie,"This blu-ray version only has the movie, no extras.What blu-ray manufacturers are thinking? The disc suppose to have 50 Gb of space. But they decided to only put the movie. Plus the quality is Ok, just a little bit better than the dvd version. What a waste of money."
3,Why watch this at all?,"I'm sure many of you saw the extended trailer at the movie theater. If not, go watch it online. Now that you've seen the entire movie, you don't need to buy it. The movie is alright, not what I consider Oscar material, but it is interesting to see what Tom Hanks looks like when he starves himself for a long time. But after watching the trailer, there's no point in seeing the movie!"
3,I'll be using UPS from now on,"In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a corrupt FedEx worker who gets his comeuppance after he opens several FedEx packages that do not belong to him while en route to an overseas FedEx delivery. He opens packages and steals the following items from trusting FedEx customers: A pair of ladies figure skates, a volleyball, a dress, and a bunch of video tapes.He ends up delivering only one of the packages that he was supposed to deliver, and it takes more than four years to make the delivery.I don't want to spoil the ending, so I'll let you find out for yourself how he gets his comeuppance."
1,"Ok, so I am the only one...","Maybe it is just me, but this movie bored the hell out of me. And this is a movie fan who has seen Gone With the Wind, The Magnificent Ambersons, and countless other movies a lot of people consider long and boring, more times than I can count. It was a good concept that did not follow through in my opinion. He is stuck on a deserted island and nothing else happens. No fights for his life with native wildlife, nothing. Maybe that sounds shallow but I guess a movie with someone just doing nothing is not my cup of tea. I sat through it to say that I did, and regret the lost hours of my life. I supose long time fans of Tom Hanks may like it, but his superstar attitude after Forrest Gump made me sick so I am not really a fan of his.I did not care for the acting, the writing, or anything about this movie but the initial premise. I never even got any feel that he was actually this person."
1,Doh !!,Never bought online before as was always worried about quality etcFirst time from Amazon using a gift voucher received.dvd does not work in my region (Australia).
2,boring and absolutely pointless movie,"this movie is so boring and predictable i can't believe tom hanks would ever agree to this. this movie has been done already. it was called robinson crusoe, and that's a classic. helen hunt and tom hanks have about as much chemistry as david hyde pierce and jane leeves on frasier. who cares. the part with tom hanks on the island was boring, but i expected that anyway. then guess what? he gets off the island. i never saw that one coming. he risks everything just to get home to helen hunt and she is married. he then the movie just kind of ends. i think he was better off staying on the island. maybe this movie should have only been shown on a deserted island so no one would have to be subjected to it."
2,Ehhhh...,The DVD Plays and then skips...and freezes. Very disappointed. Wishing for a refund. This is a great movie though. I haven't tried the second DVD yet but I'm sure if skips too.
2,Worth Watching But Ultimately Hollow.,"Many reviews already, so let me keep this brief. The movie never bored me but also didn't really 'get going'. It was nice and all that (slightly interesting), yet I felt that after walking away from it, there had been too many missed opportunities which might have lifted the feature above a mere ordinary level.Tom Hanks gave a fine performance, though his character seldom appeared realistic to me (that's just me). My main concern would be the forced ending. It was, in my opinion, not worked out fully. This had nothing to do with Hanks or Hunt, to be sure.Still, Cast Away looks good and realistic (except for the computer-made fish). I thought the crash of the plane worthy of special mention. But after Hanks got off the island, things went 'somewhat wrong'.Well, not wasted time, and I'm sure a lot of people have and will like it. My ** might be a bit harsh."
2,I could not decide whether to sleep or watch!,"This movie was a terrible bore. Very exciting start when the plane went down, but very laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survuve the crash from 20-25,000 feet. Now, this was not reality, but come on. Then it becomes a sleeper until the last 15 minutes when Hanks dialogue becomes more believable..."
4,My Three Cents,"This movie would make a good screensaver. Or better yet, a GigaPet. Just check in now and then. ""Oh, what is Chuck doing now?"" ""Oh, Chuck is still trying to open that darn coconut.""I'm only half-kidding."
3,Cast A-Wheigh?,"This SUPER-PRODUCTION could have been far better if it hadn't been so upscale, so fraught with money-schemes and agents rushing about to hammer home every red cent they could conceivably attract. As it turns out, I was disappointed when I walked out of the theater almost a year ago. And I'm even more frustrated by this DVD. All of the extra footage only seems to accentuate the paltriness of the movie - which is nothing much more than a committee-led travesty (something like your latest PTA meeting). The premise was compelling _ what happens when a typically hide-bound technologist is stranded where none of his cocksure techniques matter? The true drama of this story took place inside Chuck Nolan's head. The film fails to give us even a fleeting glimpse of this man's intelligence working through the immense problems suddenly confronting it."
3,Could have been better,"While not a terrible movie, ""Cast Away"" was by no means as good as it could have been. In fact, it's hard to really pinpoint exactly what's wrong with it. The plot moves slow, but it has to. There is almost no music to speak of, but I actually found that to be rather effective. If this film fails, it's because it really felt like it should have somehow been more than it actually was. Hanks is really better than this -- looking forward to ""Road to Perdition."""
2,A disappointment,"People raved about this movie and the previews for it looked awesome. Then I made the mistake of wasting good money to see it at the cinema. I just kept waiting for this movie to take off and it never did. Sure, the plane crash was exciting and I cried when he lost Wilson, but the whole storyline just seemed to drag on and I kept waiting for it to pick up and tie together all the loose ends. Maybe I'm just a product of the Hollywood machine and a sucker for happy endings, but I really felt let down by this movie - I had expected so much more!Don't waste your money buying this movie. If you feel you have to see it, then head out to Blockbuster and rent it."
2,"Too long, too slow, didn't live up to the hype!","The previews looked great for this one, but it really was disappointing. I watched it with some friends and we all sat around waiting for it to end...it dragged on for some time."
2,"Tedious, predictable, like a big screen saver.","Tom Hanks saves this film. Quite a bit of the problem I had watching the DVD (I did not see it in theaters) is that the plot is so incredibly simple that it has been completely given away in even the simplest of commercials. I was hoping to see much 'more' in the movie, but felt like I was watching a very long rerun even though I had never seen it before.Helen Hunt is nothing special in this film, could have been anyone in that role. The actress in the truck at the end of the film showed more acting ability.Luckily, the kids were sound asleep and I had the time to kill. It was good, but I should have rented instead of bought. Several shots on the island were spectacular, but they were sandwiched between average shots.The themes were exactly what you expect. Don't live by the clock, live to your real priorities, don't give up, blah blah. Great messages, but was not executed well enough to be the foundation of a film. They seemed trite."
2,Umm.. I musta missed the point.,"Ive been a long time Tom Hanks fan. Great guy, great actor. I went into see this movie with fears and concern over the fact that supposedly most of his screen time was gonna be him silently moping his way around a deserted island. I was completely bored through almost the whole movie, constantly checking my watch for the time. The only emotion I felt at all, was when he made friends with the volleyball, and they had that split up in the ocean.. that emotion, was happiness! I found myself laughing out loud over the fact that the maker's of this movie actually thought a man/volleyball relationship would affect a audience. Just take this movie with a grain of salt, try to enjoy it, and lets put this Hanks horror behind us and move on."
4,Well done - but over rated?,"I give Cast Away four stars - and wonder if it earned all four of them. My judgement may be clouded by my fondness for both Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis. They obviously work very well together, but this film drags at times, and the dialogue can get bogged down. Not a film I would have bought (my wife did), as it is not one I need to see more than once. That said, extremely well done, and I loved the non Hollywood ending."
5,Great movie! by an 11 year old gamer,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks a go and its great! Tom Hanks works for Fed Ex and then the plane crashed and............well u know the rest. but heed my warning, watch it early in the day because its exactly 5 hours long!"
4,"Strong acting, but some weak points as a movie",It's hard to say enough for Tom Hank's acting. Not to mention the extreme physical changes he put himself through for the part.The storyline was also strong through the early and middle parts of the movie. Some truly great moments of drama and human insight.But the ending gave me the impression that they didn't really know how to wrap up the movie. It's a bad sign when the main character has to finish the movie with a monolog that sums up what he's learned; a better movie would have made you understand without having to spell it out in words.
4,Cast Away is a great film!,"Anything directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt HAS to be at least good. Well Cast Away is great! Although they spend a little more time on the parts on the island than needed, Cast Away is still an excellent adventure film! FOUR STARS! Directed by Robert Zemeckis - What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump."
2,Why couldn't he stay on the island.....,"Between all the wooden acting that everyone gives in this movie, it was something of a relief when Tom Hanks got to the island, there we had just him and lots of nice outdoor photography to look at. That island had more character then all the human supporting cast members put together in this big budget piece of trash."
4,Beware of the Winking Whale!,"I thought this movie was pretty good. Honestly, nothing spectacular. Yet when I think about the scenes I tend to remember them all fondly. Except one. I was really enjoying the movie and just about to put it on my ""buy the DVD"" list when the whale winked at Chuck during his escape. I couldn't believe they put that in there. I can't imagine Tom Hanks screneing the film and saying ""looks great, winking whale and all."" Everything else ranged from great to highly entertaining. I will probably buy the DVD regardless of the WINKING WHALE...AAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"
5,Hanks is mesmorizing,Tom Hanks is a magnificent actor. Forget the beginning and ending of the movie. Skip to the plane crash and just watch an artist at work as he is stranded on the island. I could have watched hours of Hanks as the castaway. This movie should be required viewing for anyone interested in a career as an actor. This is not the best movie ever made but it is certainly one of the best screen performances to date.
5,Very Special for Me,"Having lived in a similar environ for a year -- but with bananas and people -- this film was magical for me. Hanks really put himself out for this film, doing a magnificent and touching performance, and I am grateful."
3,Cast Away,I was suprised that I enjoyed this film as much as I did. I would recommend it for any Tom Hanks Fan. He did a great job in this film. I'll watch it again.
3,No Man is an Island,"Tom Hanks is terrific as a FedEx engineer who is marooned on an island after his plane crashes. ""Cast Away"" proves that a great actor, with a good script, can tell a compelling story even if he's the only one in it.Though the script unfolds in a predictable way, Hanks keeps it afloat (no pun intended). Director Robert Zemeckis could have tightened the film a bit here and there, but ""Cast Away"" is still an engaging adventure story about how the will to live can help us survive."
4,TOMS ISLAND,"Another movie Tom Hanks should have gotten an oscar for! I lovedthis movie, when I saw it in the theater in 2000! I thought thestory was great, and the movie was very well made! I still feelthe pain from when he played dentist, with an iceskate! Thismovie really makes you appreciate what you have! Excellent!"
2,CAST AWAY YOUR FAT ON DESERT ISLAND DIET,"Tom Hanks loses 40 odd pounds a deserted South Pacific island. That's about it for plot in this beautiful but ordinary adventure nicely directed by Robert Zemeckis.What one expects from the intentional double meaning two-word title is that our hero experience some kind of spiritual enlightenment from the enforced ""casting away"" of civilization's ephemera. But that is not the case here.It's not giving anything away here to say that during his absence he has been declared dead and his fiancee Helen Hunt has married. But since we've recently seen Hunt cavorting on screen with Mel Gibson, Jack Nicholson, Richard Gere and Kevin Spacey among others (apparently while Hanks was island-bound), it should come as no surprise. The two-disc set includes enthusiastic commentary from Zemeckis, a startling featurette on the remarkable and wonderfully invisible digital effects and much more. 143 minutes, PG-13."
2,Almost made it.,"I really don't understand it when people talk about how Tom Hanks didn't speak during the middle portion of this movie. The volleyball was thrown in there to avoid just that. Tom Hanks has a lot of dialoge while on the island. That said, this could have been a great movie, but it fell short. First of all, we all found out that he would get off the island from the preview. That upset me. But after seeing the movie, I understood why this was done...after he gets off the island, the movie is terrible. Zemekis has therefore successfully made two bad movies out of one project. (He made the sub-par What Lies Beneath while Hanks was losing weight) It makes me worry that other good directors might end up doing the same. Next thing you know, Oliver Stone might make a lousy movie...wait a minute, I forgot about U-Turn. Darn!"
4,A MIXED BAG,"This is a film for which I have very mixed feelings. I didn't care much for it when it first came out but through DVD have surely learned to appreciate it.The plane crash is truly amazing and terrifying, the island scenes great and the escape from the island / rescue will simply leave you drained. My biggest problem has to do with the long scenes between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt at the return of the movie, they're just frustrating as closure for the characters couldn't ever exist. To top this we get a touching but long an unncesary monologue well over 2 hours into the movie.Still, a great an unique experience which somehow I find myself repeating on a regular basis."
2,Typical Hollywood third act prblems,"What could - and should - have been a triumph for Hanks is fatally ruined by one of the poorest third acts ever made. It is difficult to imagine how this happened, unless (as often) there was studio interference. See the movie as far as the end of Hank's raft voyage, then turn off the DVD and imagine how well the writer could have dealt with the main character returning to society"
4,Wilson For best Supporting ACTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The only reason I gave this movie 4 starts instead of 5 is cause I didnt really like the ending. The movie itself touched on so many levels and had so many lessons to be learned. The film basically tought that material things like our technology and the possesions that we take for granted really arent important. The film itself was very well done. Robert Z. is so talented and the camera work is amazing. The settings are gorgeous, the plane crash is terrifying... makes you feel like your there. Tom Hanks.......is incredible. You truly get to see his acting ability sense for most of the movie is only other supporting actor is a volleyball. Tom brings the feelings and emotions of being a castaway to the audience through his acting. The DVD is self has many extra features and in all is one of the best i own. This is a must buy."
3,Terrible commentary,"This is a good movie as the other reviews will attest, but the commentary is terrible. It is a combined effort of the director, the cinematographer and the chief sound guy. The problem is that the sound man does about 80% of the talking, and after hearing for the 5th time how they created the sound of a given wave so it was just right, it is tiresome. It would be better if the director and writer were the ones to do all of the talking. The technical stuff is interesting in limited doses, what is more intriguing is information that supports the development of the production, the plot and the characters."
4,DVD excellent. Most of the movie is good.,"The DVD picture and sound quality are excellent, and the extra features are very good. Even the keepcase, no kidding, is nice and solid. Yes, the movie could explore more closely what constitutes true loneliness and true aloneness. (Perhaps a scene with Hanks standing in a stress-inducing line at Target to buy a Wilson volleyball would have been a good conclusion instead of the idealized and narratively weak one we get.) But the central sequence, from the plane crash through the rescue, is extremely well done. Give credit where it is due, and Hanks is terrific in this music-free film. When you play the DVD, make a special point of paying attention to the sound when he is on that little island."
5,Great Features!,The Movie is excellent and the 2nd DVD is worth itself for the price. When you see all the work they did for the Film you'll be amazed.
4,depends on the crowd,"Really liked this movie about 5 days after I saw it originally. It took awhile for its content to ""hit"" me. I also saw it in a theater where the people laughed at Tom Hanks' antics, rather than sympathized, which I think really detracted from the film. It gives you a lot to think about - what you would do if you were stranded, what you'd think about, etc. Overall, I think it's a really good movie, but the plot dragged a little and I didn't like the ending (everything happened too fast and too easy)."
3,"Good movie, good DVD gets old",If you saw the movie and you liked it then you will like the DVD. And if you havent seen the movie and if you collect DVDs this is a good one to add to your collection.
3,TOM HANKS IS VERY GOOD BUT......,"THE ONLY REASON THIS FILM GOT 3 STARS WAS BECAUSE OF TOM HANKS AMAZING ACTING ABILITY(AGAIN).TRUST ME THOUGH WHEN I SAY THAT IF THERE WAS A MEDIOCRE ACTOR IN THIS IT WOULD BE A COMPLTET FLOP.THE IDEA IS VERY APPEALING.A MAN STRANDED ON A ISLAND FOR MANY YEARS WITH NOONE.DONT FORGET THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO INTERACTION IN THIS FILM,THE LITTLE THERE IS IS WITH A FOOTBALL.I WAS SORELY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS FILM,AS TOUCHING AS IT IS,THERE IS NO CONTENT."
5,Awesome Blu ray quality,"Wow, what a great blu ray title to have, the plane crash in surround sound was like a plane crashing into my house, and the island scenes were breathtaking, highly recommended blu ray purchase, even if you have the dvd like me"
4,One Fantastic Acting Job,"Since such a desert island scenario involves isolation, the plot thus must by its nature involve such boredom as fishing, scavinging for food, etc.Hanks pulls this off superbly. I was surprised that this kept my attention. Was smart enough to realize that the opening scene of the sculpter would be tied into with the FedEx delivery.Wilson was a treat!Ending was well conceived. Left one's mind to the imagination to fill in the blank.Very enjoyable."
4,A great flick with a sad ending,"After his plane goes down a man is made to survive, alone, on a deserted island. After undergoing several challenges including building fires, living quarters, and obtaining food; he finally returns home where he meets his almost fiance to be girlfriend. Although I don't like the ending (which I won't give away here), this is a flick for all to see!"
3,Blu-ray version no better than DVD.,"I own the original DVD version of the film and love it; it's one of my very favorite movies. So I was pretty excited to see it out on Blu-ray and picked it up. I knew that the island scenes would be amazing with the higher resolution...I was wrong.I'm seeing this in other movies, too. Some films, like the Pirates of the Carribean series are so sharp they makes your eyes hurt. Cast Away looked so much like the regular DVD version I though I'd bought the old format version.I'm convinced there must be a cheap fast way and an expensive right way to issue a blu-ray film, and I'm convinced the studio took the easy way out on this one. Since I've got both version it's easy to compare, and sad to say, the blu-ray isn't worth the money. It's an awesome story, but I expected more from the blu-ray experience. Other movies do."
1,"Reviewing the product, not the movie","I'm a big, big fan of this movie, so I was excited to get the blu-ray version, thinking it would be beautiful given the subject and location of the film.Sadly, this is a blu-ray in technical format only. The transfer looks WORSE than the DVD version I have. That's right, worse. Skip this and wait for some ""remastered"" (and probably more expensive version).Again, love the movie, loath the blu-ray transfer."
2,A bit disappointing,"I love this movie, but in the blu-ray format you see too much. You see all the film grain in the opening scenes and other artifacts throughout the movie. Maybe there is a way to take this out and then put it on blu-ray?"
3,Good film but too long.,"Cast Awat starring Tom Hanks is a good and sad film but it runs 45 minutes too long. The beginning and middle are the best and satisfying parts, the last hour is a bit of a letdown and the ending is left open so the viewer can ponder what road this man has decided to embark on. Hanks is the best thing in this film, his acting is remarkable, only he could pull off this quiet but intense performance. Helen Hunt is miscast and so is Chris Noth. Cast Away is worth a viewing, so check it sometime."
5,Cast Away Your Doubts About Zemeckis,"After the gutsy first five minutes of ""Contact"" (showing how insignificant we all are on this little planet!), director Zemeckis outdoes himself with ""CastAway"" with many inventive and exhilarating scenes of loss, joy, and a little madness. Hanks delivers an indelible character who runs the gamut of emotions and physical torment in over two hours. The DVD has exceptional sound/picture. One of the pure joys was Zemeckis' decision not to use music; only the sounds of the ocean and nature take precedent and shape the character and the story. The DVD comes very close to capturing the theatre experience. The extras are great and add a lot to the overall package. This one is a keeper and sure to be a classic years from now."
3,Rather flat.,"This movie is over rated. It holds the attention but is not spectacular. Tom Hanks' performance and the whole movie is rather flat. Ever since Mr. Hanks started winning Oscars he doesn't seem to get into his roles but acts like he's acting with a lot of close ups of him supposedly showing emotion. One didn't get the feeling he was really attached to the volleyball but that he was acting as if he was. Contrast this performance with the one in ""A League of Their Own"". In that movie he ""was"" the drunken manager, not just acting ""as if"". The movie would have been a lot better if it had showed more of what his emotions were when he was on the island rather than just his learning how to live there. For example, it should have shown all the things he told his friend he had gone through instead of just telling his friend. This movie was one where the critics felt they had to like it because of who made it and who was in it."
5,One of my favorite movies of all time!,I rented the movie to watch because my girlfriend had never watched it before and she also loved it. Go Wilson!!!!!!! MUST WATCH!!
3,Not worth owning,In my opinion this movie isn't worth owning really. I meen for one I felt that the whole thing was totaly ripping off from the Hatchet which had a much better premis. Not to say that Tom Hanks isn't a good actor because he is but I felt it was missing something crucial that would have made it into a better movie. On a side note I think it would have been much better if it was more about how Tom Hanks character comes back after being marooned on the island and learning how to adapt back into civilization.
2,A two-and-a-half-hour FedEx commercial,"The title says it all, so I will be brief; as a FedEx (and a little bit of Dr. Pepper) commercial, this attemp very powerfully describes the dedication of a courier worker. (At least I got - the otherwise rather subtle - message: Tom Hanks character struggles to survive not only to be with his loved one again, but also in order to be able to deliver at least one parcel.) As a movie, it is unoriginal with a boring a demagogue ending. Nevertheless, there are also a few good moments (seconds, to be correct), thanks to Mr. Hanks - and a couple of whales."
2,Z Grade,"Another Z grade movie I've watched just for the satisfaction of strengthening my despite for commercial productions. The whole story is unbelievable to say at least and acting could be a lot better. Totally boring, awfully long and painfull to watch. Any intelligent person would instantly take the DVD back and demand a money return, but guess what? I'm quite a masochist and had the godly patience to wait until it finished. ...."
1,"Very Good DVD, but ...","Never got to see it on the theater but I did rent the DVD. The DVD has a many interested features. Details on the production and interviews with survival experts. It is a good DVD.The one star is because I didn't like the movie. If you liked Cast Away. You will love the DVD. If you are like me and appreciate nothing about the movie, or if you haven't seen Cast Away. Rent first. I'm very glad I did."
2,This film did not capture my attention,"I was really looking forward to viewing this film and had high expectations. Maybe it was the fact that Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt starred in the film. Or maybe it was the fact that Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump director) directed this film.However, the movie did not live up to expectations for me. I guess I could say I was dissappointed with the affect the film had on me. It seemed to drag on and in fact I found the scenes from the island to be quite boring at times. Not to mention the weak ending.There were a few positives about the film such as the scenery and the some of the humor.I usually rate a movie based on the way it affects my emotions. This film only succeeded in boring and frustrating me. Overall, not a good movie experience."
1,Cannot believe people liked this,"This is far and away the most overrated film I have seen in a very long time. If you've seen the trailer or tv spots for this, you've seen the film. NO surprises, NO twists, NO real plot, and BORING. I beleive Forest Gump was one of the finest films ever made, so I'm not a Hanks/Zemekis critic, but this film was just predictible and dull. Nuff said."
1,wrrgghh!,"god, I hate this movie. it is so bad, boring, and uninteresting. just wanted to let you know!"
1,Were Tom Hanks a magician ...,"... he might have been able to save this movie. BUT he is not and could not.It is his worst movie ever! (And what a waste of the other actor's talents, especially Helen Hunt!)"
1,Pretty bad,"I am sorry, but those who thought that Tom Hanks should have won an oscar or other such nonsense need to see more films. His performance, most especially in the middle portion, was one-dimensional. The beginning was mildly entertaining, highly cliched and predictable. Tom shouts a lot and is generally obnoxious and insensitive. Then he ends up on the island and shouts some more. Hanks' acting technique: if I shout loud and often enough and lose weight, I'm a great actor. We were supposed to see despair, hope, weariness, introspection, anger, frustration and sorrow. What we got was a lot of crazed shouting. Loud and grating, crazed shouting. If you take out the middle portion of this movie, you have a very unoriginal, short mildly entertaining mainstream movie - with the middle, it just plain stinks."
4,A WELL TOLD TALE,This well written and well researched book tells the fascinating tale of the trial and execution of King Charles I at the end of the English Civil War. I have read several books dealing with this time period and thought that this was one of the best. It was so exciting that I ended up staying up much too late reading it.
1,The opposite of its promises,"This is an awful movie! If you will note I titled this review ""The Opposite of its promises"", and the reason being is that, first of all it shows Danny DeVito on the front of the cover as if he is the main character, and yet he barely has a part, posing as the bartender at a pool and is only seen for abot forty five seconds. Also it says it is heart-felt and funny and is none of those things! The actors and actresses do a horrible job posing as their charachter and don't seem to have any depth or feeling at all. If you read the back of the jacket it says that it is about a man with almost no money and many debts to pay off and that he kidnaps a rich man's kids to get money, that is the entire film and it isn't even done well, in fact I've made this putrid film sound much more exciting and dramatic than it is. The film has absolutely no depth. It has no comedy,drama, romance, excitement or any thing like that. It is no doubt one of the worst films ever."
3,Arlen and Mercer's swan song - a dying swan.,"Two of our greatest song writers, Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer, who gave their best to the screen and tin pan alley, could not make it on Broadway. This was the last of their attempts and it is, frankly, dull. There are fifteen songs and one ballet. Out of these there are only four that spark some interest: the jaunty GETTIN A MAN, THE MEN WHO RUN THE COUNTRY, and THE CURE as well as the love song, LOVE HELD LIGHTLY. But the rest is just mediocre - acceptable but mediocre. The show lasted only 80 performances with Cecil Beaton earning the show's only Tony Noms (for Sets and Costumes), winning for Costumes. If you like Carol Lawrence or Howard Keel, then by all means buy this. If you're an Arlen or Mercer fan, don't. Remember them by their other works, the hits."
4,Quite wonderful and a steal at $7.98,After listening to the preview and reading that Arlen & Mercer wrote the songs...I decided to invest $7.98. I relly like this CD. It is quite wonderful.
3,Lester lets her temper fester,"The last episode of Star Trek. And what a sour note to go out on. It does not portray the ambitions of Janice Lester in a positive light. We know she doesn't have the temperament to be a captain. The writers seem to think a woman commander is out of the question. You might notice that there were no women Captains in the original series.Well, in this one a jealous Lester switches bodies with Captain Kirk. When the crew notice he's acting strangely they attempt to remove him from command. While it was implausible at best; it was fun to see the revolt against Kirk. Something the actors might have wanted to do in real life. Because Shatner did not treat his fellow cast members well if they were not part of the Kirk, Spock, McCoy team."
2,Not very good,A somewhat interesting premise which does not really work. Shatner actually comes as off silly trying to play a woman inhabiting a man's body. Other characters act out-of-character as well.
1,Poor example of a wireless controller,"Recently I have purchased 3 different wireless controllers. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!! The main problem with this controller is that the left analog stick is rendered utterly useless. Without it being precise it makes gaming more difficult. Also, its desine is quite chinsy. BUY THE ONE SOLD BY BETSKU. It is blue and says Sega on it. Works excellent!"
2,"interesting subject, mediocre presentation","This book consists of a set of lectures delivered at NYU. Although it is apparent that they must have been fascinating speeches, the transmission to the printed word does not remotely do them justice. The most obvious failure is the lack of an index, references, or figures is grating. The problem goes deeper than that as the book is simply not in the style of a written work.There are many superior works on the subject available, some of them by the same authors who contributed the lecture notes (I hesitate to call them ""chapters"")."
3,Getting to Know ArcView,"This is another teaching book with a CD. The CD works well and does what it is supposed to do. Although the cover says the CD is a trial version of ArcView. That is just a lie. The CD contains a special version of ArcView that works only with the exercises.The book spends too much time introducing itself. It is itself an introduction but the first 100 or so pages are spent saying what they resay in the remaining chapters; and with terms the novice will probably not understand at first. I found that the book had a hard time begining, kept thinking, ""When are they going to get to the point?""Would like to see more about how to convert raw data to a file that can displayed; it finally came in chapter in 25 but only briefly."
1,WARNING! This is Book Only Covers ArcView 3!,"OLD VERSION ALERT! OLD VERSION ALERT!Be warned that this book covers ArcView 3.As critical as it is to get the book that covers the correct version of the software that you have, it is amazing that the version number is not highlighted anywhere. (The only indication that this is not for a current version is the date of publication; I usually check the publishing date on any tech book, but somehow I missed it on this book.)As for it's fitness as a guide to ArcView version 3, I can't honestly say..."
3,For those needing fundamentals,"I bought this book to update my ESRI skills. I felt like the majority of the book was just basics, and the functionality of the included CD was somewhat limited. I feel one of the most important basics is to be able to create a layer from scratch, you cannot do this with the trial version. I understand why this is from a legal point, but not a learning point. I felt like the tutorials were far too basic, and had more of an eye on the cartography than the science and analysis. Overall, its a good book for beginners, but the more savvy user would find this boring."
3,Helpful but...,"Helpful for those books not included in a Protestant Bible however, it did not live up to my expectation. I would not buy it again or recommend it to others."
3,Sheen is a too short JFK. Hoover exaggerated.,"Watch the scenes in which Sheen and the actor playing Bobby are walking together. Bobby has to crouch to legitimize some scenes - call the chiropractor. Hoover is portrayed as menacing and vicious. Joseph Kennedy calls Hoover a ""fag"" which Hoover was not. Hoover was married to the FBI, plain and simple. There is no evidence to suggest any homosexuality or transvesticism but the Liberals love to perpetuate the MYTH and now its become fact in the culture with ""no evidence"" to support it and the originator of the myth spent time in prison. So much for credibility."
3,The accents go wrong here and there,"Being from Massachusetts, I can say that the attempted Kennedy accents in this 1983 miniseries are occassionally almost accurate, never entirely perfect, and sometimes just plain awful. Still, the writing and acting here are pretty good for a TV movie of this vintage. Some parts go on way too long, such as the Bay of Pig and civil rights segments, and J. Edgar Hoover is creepy sometimes, but mostly just over the top. Resemblances are uncanny, though, to the real Hoover and Jackie Kennedy. Martin Sheen as JFK is close, but no cigar. EG Marshall as old man Kennedy does a great job. This is certainly no substitute for history, but as a TV entertainment, it remains impressive. The cutting is pretty contemporary for something of this vintage. This, overall, holds up pretty well."
4,Excellent account of one of our greatest presidents,"This movie, first shown on NBC in Nov. '83 to coincide with the anniversary of of JFK's death, is a great tribute to the man, his times and his legacy. Brilliantly portrayed by Martin Sheen, JFK comes to life on the small screen, and Blair Brown gives a great performance as First Lady Jackie. This DVD is the COMPLETE version of the 3 part miniseries that was originally aired on tv.All in all, GREAT release for the DVD format. From Election Night to Assassination, the film tells the whole story of Kennedy's presidency. Not to be missed!"
2,Boring,"I only watched the first two shows and probably will not watch the rest. The show is boring, repetitive, and petty. To much emphasis on Joe Kennedy's obsession with family honor, Jackie Kennedy's ""I am not public property"", and Bobby Kennedy's reluctance to accept Attorney General position. My expectations were comparable to ""West Wing"", my mistake. ""Kennedy"" is more like soap opera than historical significants."
4,Kennedy,Arrived quickly! My husband enjoyed this series years ago and was glad to locate it on the web. No complaints.
4,More than one lucky lady,"While her widowed mother works abroad, twelve-year-old Jamie must leave her Maine home to spend the summer at her grandfather's ranch. She impulsively buys a unbroken horse at an auction. Jamie copes with change and adversity as this exciting adventure unfolds.Two weeks may not seem like a very long time, but the lives of three generations are changed in this satisfying tale.This is written by the author of the popular ""Sleepover Friends"" series and would be enjoyable for fans in upper elementary grades and junior high. Readers interested in Texas, ranching, grandfathers or horses should like it as well."
2,Too Big,This shirt was way to big. The sleeves were long which was good considering I have long arms but it was way to wide. I could have wrapped myself in it. The return process was too much work too. I wish I had checked that before purchasing. It did arrive pretty quickly though.
2,Disappointed,"This shirt does not wash and dry well, comes out wrinkled on cold water, low heat and small load. The material is cheep.For a similar price I got a much nicer shirt, same style from JC Penney on sale."
5,great book,"Great book. Doesn't try to get super-fancy in the food, just a pile of good eats. You can really tell the authenticity of the recipes, I felt like I learned a lot about spanish cooking simply by reading through the recipes and the techniques. I haven't really used the wine section of the book much, but it seemed thorough as well."
2,It might be realistic...,"...but all the recipes come out very bland. I've tried a few of them and there's really nothing that stands out. I'll try a few more before I sell this one. It's a shame, because the book is put together rather well and is easy to follow."
3,WAIT for NEW 4.2i version,XSE 2.1I is great BUT the new 4.2i will blow it out of the water.4.21 will be available in early summer 2002.
4,Side-Splittingly Funny,"If you like Bottom or The Young Ones then this is the video for you.Kevin is an investigative reporter for the BBC but never EVER sticks to the subject in hand, and as he ends up in a mad improvisational tangent, you're rolling round the floor with laughter!!A must buy!!"
4,Rik Mayall fans in for a treat!,"The role of Kevin Turvey might have been the prototype for ""Rick"" in Young Ones. Kevin is a total dork and you wonder who he paid off to get his investigative reporter job. Wild parties, vomit, anoraks, sex, dating, death -- Kevin has been there and done ...well...you gotta see it."
5,Awesome for peeling dry skin!,"I have been using Differin for my acne and my skin started flaking and peeling really bad. It was also getting very sensitive. After searching online and reading reviews, I decided to go to Walgreens and pick this up. It is kinda pricy for a drugstore cream but completly worth it! I applied it the first night and noticed a huge difference the next morning! After a week, my skin has seen a 100% improvement! No flaking, peeling, burning at all. I have only been applying it at night time, and so it seems that this will last me a couple of months at least, so I'm very comfortable with the price. Give it a try! I love it, and you may too!"
1,Cerave AM facial lotion,"This product made my face itch especially around the chin/mouth area. I think it was like a minor chemical burn. After trying it for less than a week (hoping my skin would get used to it), I give up. Now, my skin is peeling. Perhaps, I am allergic to it? Awfully expensive to waste. :("
5,"Amazing Product, Best Lotion on Market!!!","My pharmacist recommended CeraVe lotion for my toddler's Eczema. He uses it on his kids who also have eczema. Once I applied it to her arm, it almost instantly cleared up the eczema! The prescriptions from her pediatrician didn't do that in two weeks!!! It was just getting worse and worse! I used it on my hands as well, and the next day they were still moisturized. It's amazing stuff. No scent either. It's just everyday lotion anyone can use! My pharmacist said dermatologists are in love with the stuff, and I can see why. I've never seen anything else work like this. We live in Utah too- an extremely dry state. We will be using this lotion exclusively- and every day. It really is a ""miracle"" cream!!!"
2,"Good, But the Lotion is Better","I picked this up when my local drugstore was sold out of the usual Cerave lotion (the one in the pump bottle), thinking it would be a suitable replacement.This is essentially the same product, but thicker and richer. It doesn't seem to absorb quite as well as the lotion at first, and leaves you feeling pretty greasy. On the other hand, it does seem more powerful and restorative.My biggest gripe is the packaging. Why is this just sitting in a big bucket and not in a pump? You have to stick your fingers into it, contaminating the bulk with each use. Ick."
2,Makes my face sweat,"This cream is fine for night-time, but not for daytime because it coats your face and isn't absorbed into the skin. If the weather is hot and humid or if I am active the cream makes my face look wet. I won't buy again."
4,Great value for the price,"I chose this product even though there is another CeraVe listed at Amazon with the same content/quantity(16oz),but cheaper(USD 12.97 vs 20).The only difference I could find was the weisght,this was 1.5 pounds the other was 1 pound.The other one had not so good reviews and was listed as ""origin:China"".The cream itself feels good,wont leave that oily feeling.The tub lacks any type of protective barrier when opened,making you wonder whether it is used and re-filled(?)."
5,I'll never use anything else!,"I read good reviews before purchasing this item and I am glad I decided to get it! This moisturizer works wonders. My hands are never dry anymore. After buying this, I bought their face lotion and facial cleanser too and love them both also!! I'm very impressed (and the company doesn't test on animals!)."
2,Not as good as expected,"I use Proactive for acne treatment. And my skin tends to become very dry afterwards, especially at my nose. The cerave cream moisturises other face regions well, but it does not moisturize my nose region well or long enough. I tried to put a lot on my nose region, but the cream was too thick to get absorbed, leaving unabsorbed white stretches on my nose. I strongly wish that the cream can be less thick and more absorbing."
3,Didn't help my girl's eczema at all,Wasn't helpful at all for my baby who has eczema. Not moisturizing enough for very dry skin. It is very easy to apply though.
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE,My wife has tried many expensive face creams. This procduct seems to be as good or better than creams costing much more.. She is very satisfied with product...
4,Pretty good with one exception...,"I am very athletic and I go swimming a lot. I would say an hour after putting on this product, your skin is very slippery. While getting out of a pool holding onto the rail or climbing out, my legs and hands had me slip right back into the pool. I see that the substance obviously retains moisture but I wouldn't think this stuff would work as a ""water-proof"" type of cream. Other then that, it's sensitive to eczema skin and does leave it supple and soft."
5,"The ONLY moisturizer you need, especially for kids!","My daughter had eczema really bad as a baby and fortunately has since grown out of it, but while she was being treated by a pediatric dermatologist they recommended we use this moisturizer on her. All I can say is it is AMAZING! When we went back to her regular pediatrician she couldn't believe what beautiful skin my daughter had! I use it on both my daughters now, I put it all over their skin after baths and their skin is flawless! I use it on myself too!"
2,Not for everyone,"My son has atopic dermatitis and he just recently went to the dermatologist. The dermatologist prescribed a steroid cream and then recommended we buy Cerave...for his eczma. The reason I was reading the reviews was because I don't feel this product is beneficial for his skin and wanted to see if other people had a problem with it drying skin out. Another doctor has told me that you should never put anything on sensitive or eczema prone skin that the ingredients start with water or alcohol....so I was shocked to see this dermatologist got us to buy a cream that has those two things first in its ingredients.I believe it may help some people, but everyone's skin is different, what works for one person doesn't work for another so keep that in mind when buying this product."
4,Not as Good as the First four but still worth owning.,"This movie is a continuation of Son of Frankenstein with the monster, player by the great Lon Chaney, and Ygor, played by the Immortal Bela Lugosi, in search of the other son of Frankenstein. I felt that Chaney played a more aggresive monster than Karloff did in Son of Frankenstein and that the movie was faster paced.But it was never explaned how Ygor survived getting shot in the last film and how if lighting could hurt the monster in the previous film how getting struck by it this time made him stronger."
2,Poor Film Making,"Everything about this movie does not work. From the poor script, to the casting of Lon Chaney who plays a Frankenstein creature that is devoid of emotions. Unlike Boris Karloff who gave the monster a personality. This is why film franchises don't work. They ruin the idea after they make more movies then the current story allows."
4,Classic with a twist,They don't make them like this anymore. A classic horror film with actors youv'e seen before but in different roles.
1,An original foray into electronic music - for 1981,"Funker Vogt delievers mediocre music, with worse vocals and even worse lyrics. There is something sad about an electronic music band whose seems to be using inferior synth technology than Kraftwerk did. If you want Industrial, get yourself some NIN, KMFDM/MDFMK, Ministry, Coil, TKK, Pig, or any other of the highly rated CDs in this section. Ignore this one and save yourself some bucks. If you're anything like me, you'll feel like a sucker for having bought this."
2,dine-in tonite with a slice of horror lite,"Fans of uber cheesy monster flicks might like this but I found it to be rather boring. Disappointing because this could've been so much more. And don't be fooled the so called ""original uncensored version"" could pass for PG-13 or perhaps even PG. No nudity, no real gore, etc... I wonder what had to be cut out of the R-rated version? We're talking ""after-school special"" type horror here. The only real cool scene for me is when maggots erupt from the face of a slime-caked corpse. And there's an ok scene where a guy melts down into a puddle of mush. Whatever. So basically, this one's too slowly paced and doesn't contain enough of the juicy stuff to sustain much interest for the jaded horror fan. Next please."
1,This was refurbished not new !!!,On this sellers site they showed a refurbished bluetooth for 29.95 & this was billed as new OEM. for 69.95 shop for new someplace other than these folks. The one I receved was scratched up & would not even come on after charging for 4 hrs.
2,Black Water,Filter was installed on the ice maker water line. Went to get ice cubes the next day and they were black. Flush filter before installing.
4,Soap Opera Digest,"I have read two issues of Soap Opera Digest. It provide's a concise overview of all the soaps. I read other entertainment magazines, but they do not provide any information or pictures on day time soap operas. If your interested in learning who the actors and actresses are plus in brief descriptions of plots this is your magazine for day time soap operas."
3,Cover Price: $182.00 ????,"Aside from the outrageous price listed here as ""Cover Price: $182.00,"" this is a decent magazine, giving just enough space to each soap to make it worth reading. The spoilers are interesting, and better than what some of the other magazines have. I think this is the one others try to keep up with."
2,Flawed and Poorly Written,"Most of Contemporary's GED books, including Pre-GED Social Studies, are high quality and prepare students well for the test. It's hard to believe that Pre-GED Science came from the same publisher. The book is riddled with dozens upon dozens of typos. It's as if it was hastily typed and never proofread before being published. What's worse is that many of the practice questions are very poorly worded and confusing. After getting tired of telling discouraged students not to worry about getting a wrong answer because the question was badly written, I finally shelved this book and looked elsewhere for material. Contemporary's Comprehensive GED book has an excellent Science section. Again, I can't believe such a reputable publisher would allow a book as flawed as this one to be printed."
4,Tools good - case OK,Good tools - The blow molded case does not hold the tools in place so it's more like a divided drawer. So if you tilt the case the tools fall out.
1,MONICA,"Her name was Monica. Young college graduate with an interest in the workings of government. Youth and beauty, she caught the attention of a U.S. President. They spent many private moments together and enlightened each other's world. The final end result? She wrote a book...No, not the Monica of 1998, but Monica Crowley of Fox TV among others. In an unethical way, Ms. Crowley takes advantage of an aged President in his unguarded moments. Would Nixon have revealed all if he had known she was writing a book?While Monica Lewinsky has been trashed as prostituting herself for the sake of self-promotion, Monica Crowley has prostituted herself for the sake of academia legitimacy. What's next? Nixon in Summer? Nixon in Autumn? Nixon in Spring?"
3,"A good, insightful read","This provides a valuable glimpse at Nixon's personality and his shrewd insights on contemporary political figures and events. The author -- although clearly a hardcore loyalist -- remains reasonably objective throughout. It's a short read, and is recommended for anyone with an interest in Nixon."
3,This book is a great first step.,We found this book a great introductory teaching tool and motivator. With the help of Kids On The Trail my daughter enjoyed hiking in the Adirondacks. Mt. Jo and Mt. Hadley were amazing!!
5,Superb Starter Guide!,"I picked this item up at the local big box book store for its shelf apeal. I haven't been disapointed. There is a focus on the high peak region. But, it is a great started for those thinking of trying some of the not so popular hikes away from the high peaks. This book allows a quick guide to most of the Adirondack Park as a whole. I use it with other resources for more spcific tail guides and hiking planning. I one case it was used on a full day of hiking (12 or so hours) that I my wife, kids and some of their friends did. This book will excite you and your family to get out and hike! (then buy more and more stuff to explore more and more, hehehe!)"
2,Not for experienced campers,"Kids on the trail gives shallow coverage to a wide range of topics. Though there are some helpful hints and reminders, the content should be pretty obvious to anyone whose taken kids out even for a day at the park. That kids walk slowly, need snacks and water is no relevation. The second half of the book is devoted to a few Adirondack trail descriptions broken down by region. However, the trails discussed are but a tiny sample of the many in the area, so you're out of luck for many many routes. This section may yet prove useful, as it includes comments on terrain difficulty with kids in mind, but still this type of information, and more of it, would be readily available in a book devoted to Adirondack trails or even a topographical map. So if that is what you want, get a book devoted to that topic."
3,Great cover,"""Immortal?"" is a good disc but not of the same excellence as ""Contagion"" or ""The Visitor"". ""Chosen"" has all the elements of a classic Arena song - superb musicianship, strong melodies and great arrangements. They don't overplay and there is plenty of space for the song to breathe. ""The Butterfly Man"" and the 20-minute ""Moviedrome"" are also highlights of the disc. The remaining tracks are decent but lack the power and punch of those listed above. Those new to Arena may want to start the journey elsewhere and come back to this."
3,Dark - good but very dark,"I bought The Visitor and loved it - it had some dark elements, but overall, a very good progressive offering. I bought this expecting something of the same. It's similar, but I don't like it as much as The Visitor. The music is very good, but the lyrics get a bit overdone. It's not something I can listen to very often. If you like The Visitor, you might like this, but then again, you may not. If you're curious - go ahead, but if you wwant a sure bet - I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,Last ditch effort,"I wanted to like Arena. I have tried very hard, put all my efforts into it but it's not going to happen. Being a lover of bands such as IQ and Marillion, I thought it would be an easy transition. I purchased The Visitor, Peppers Ghost, Contagion and now Immortal has come to me and it all sounds like the same CD. It's very cheesy sounding Prog with vocals that remind me of an English Shakespearean actor over delivering his lines.This will be my last purchase. Musically, it's highly unimaginative and sounds like there was a PROG blueprint followed. Well, they have some interesting CD covers,I'll give them that."
2,Reconsider remembering,"2 1/2Suffers typically from a particular neo-prog rock syndrome whereas cheesed-out, vocal-driven songwriting overwhelms the few powerful instrumental sections to mine."
1,A Called Strike,"W.P. Kinsella may well be the greatest writer of baseball fiction in America. Except for a few lines at the first and the last of the book, this isn't about baseball. W.P. Kinsella is a fine novelist. This book is not really a novel. It is a short story which has been padded until it is novel length. The New York times likens it to the ""humerous voice of Garrison Keillor."" That may well be the cruk of its problem. Kinsella uses a Keilloresque trick of giving long, descriptive names to people and then repeating them each time he encounters them in his monologue. This works for Garrison Keillor; it does not work for Kinsella. Instead of making the book funny, it makes the book hard to read. In the end, I did what no one should have to do with a favorite author; I finished the book from a sense of duty"
1,"If you need to sleep at night, read this book!","I cannot begin to tell you the disappointment I felt upon completing this book. Expecting another Kinsella masterpiece, I was disappointed, to say the least. The book was just overly repetitive and the plot was horrible. While the IOWA BASEBALL CONFEDERACY kept me interested, BOX SOCIALS had me wishing it was finished already. If I read about hot-blooded girls and the Little American Soldier one more time, I think I was going to go postal. Mr. Kinsella, will you refund the cover price for me?? And if this is the best you can do, it's about time to head out to pasture!"
4,crimson trace for kel-tec,"This item is perfect for the kel-tec P3AT. The factory sights are useless for low light shooting. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the first one sent to me didn't work properly. Crimson Trace gave me excellent customer service and replaced it immediately, postage free. If you own one of these little pistols I highly recommend this product."
3,Mediocre; not her best,"At first glance I thought a story involving Nostradamus, Catherine de Medici as well as a host of royal subjects and sorcerers would be enticing. Although this book is written in Ms. Riley's unique style of humor and cynicism, I kept waiting for something to happen. ""The Oracle Glass"" was far more captivating; it's Ms. Riley's best, in my opinion. ""Vision of Light"" is also a good read."
4,"Lovely, lovely, lovely!","Judith Merkle Riley is one of my favorite historical fiction authors. Her stories and characters are just offbeat enough to keep me smiling with enjoyment from beginning to end.In this novel, Sibille Artaud, the daughter of minor nobility and an aspiring, if bad, poet, has unwittingly acquired the ""Master Of All Desires"": an ornate box containing the undying head of Menander, an ancient evil magician who will grant any wish to anyone, exactly as it is wished. These wishes often result in tragedy and death, and Menander likes it like that. Sibille's accidental possession of this horrific relic brings her to the attention of the French queen Catherine de Medici and the legendary seer Nostradamus, each of whom has an overweening interest in the box and its contents, albeit for differing reasons. How Sibille negotiates the treacherous ground she's encountered and achieves her ultimate destiny makes for a marvelous story. Compelling reading. Highly recommended."
5,Tapestry of Adventure,"Charming and compelling story. Vivid and alluring characters. Intricate background. Clever and satisfying plot strands, drawn together in unexpected moments. It has the full scenic scope of history, with the intimate dramas of breathing, loving, foolish, scheming, romantic, royal, and real people--along with ghosts, tarot, spirits, devils, and prophecy. From Nostradamus to Catherine de Medici to Mary Queen of Scots to lovers, bankers, fops, sorceresses, and duelists, this is a grand and captivating novel. I loved every page and I am sorry to have it end."
3,Not the best from Ms. Riley,"Ms. Riley is one of the very few authors that I buy in hardcover. Rigerously researched, richly spiritual, challenging stories...I have come to expect and treasure these traits in her books. This one, while better by far than most of the other stuff on the market, was sub-standard. The story was so 'out there' that it demeaned the the whole thing. Talking heads, angels, ghosts, magic and what not. Let's introduce a little more reality, shall we? Please keep writing, Ms. Riley. But next time provide us with a story and characters that are worth your considerable talent and our valuable time."
3,Enjoyable but...,"Not as good as Riley's previous work. I'm a huge fan of hers, so I had been counting the months until this latest release. I must say, I'm a bit disappointed. ""The Master of All Desires"" contains all the elements of Riley's previous work (history, humor, magic, romance), yet I just can't into the characters. Sibille and Nicholas are no Margaret and Gregory (""A Vision of Light"")I think the problem is that Riley jumps around to a lot of historical personages, but forgets to spend time with the main characters, who seem shallow in comparison to her previous heroines."
5,"Don't buy Adventure Journals, buy this on instead!","Take my word for it, this book is worth buying just for ""The Blaze of Glory"", the best SW short-story ever written!"
3,Pretty hit or miss.,"This is certainly not the best Star Wars book ever written. The plots aren't all that great, and they don't interweave the way some of the other ""Tales"" books do. The stories are pretty hit or miss, with many dull, slow, boring ones thrown together with a couple of diamonds in the ruff. Some of the stories also might be hard to understand for the casual fan. I would recommend Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina, or Tales from Jabba's Palace instead."
3,Interesting approach but not what you may be expecting,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading the book but I didn't know anyone in the stories. The stories give you an interesting perspective of what ""else"" was happening in the galaxy while Luke, Han and Leia were doing there thing. I just finsihed it a couple of nights ago and I must admit that I really did enjoy the last story. If you are like me and waiting for next ""traditional"" Star Wars book, this book isn't a bad way to bide your time."
1,A disapointing collection for the Empire,"What the title and the cover seem to promise is far from the actual content. Sure the stories are set in the Star Wars universe, but unlike the other collections (Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Tales of the Mos Eisely Cantina, Tales from Jabba the Hutt) these stories are very bland, and uninteresting at times.Sure, some of the stories and characters were noteworthy, but a large disapointment to fans of Boba Fett, Grand Admiral Thrawn, other main characters and the ideology and structure of the Empire itself. Actually, a few stories had nothing to do with the Empire at all it seemed, maybe just a footnote, but nothing that compares to the grandeur of the Empire as depicted in the movies and some of the other recent novels.I am a huge SW fan, and have read about 80% of 'all' novels set within the universe, and this by far is one I want to forget about."
2,Don't believe the title,"One would think with a title like this, the stories would be about the EMPIRE. Wrong! Many stories have the empire as a small footnote, or nothing at all. I expected stories with empire characters, but there were few. I liked a few stories, like Blaze of Glory, but most of them were pathetic. I dont recomend you buy it, but it mind be good to borrow."
1,"De Niro lives in a mean, mean world.","Gil (Robert De Niro) appears to inhabit the same parallel universe as the characters in ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" where all conversation consists of yelled obscenities. It's all a little exaggerated, and De Niro doesn't really seem crazy/dangerous until at least an hour into the film. His leap off the deep end also stretches credibility. Then there's the ""crazy collage"" of newspaper clippings about the target of his obsession, Giants outfielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes). Its only purpose was to remind me of a similar device in ""The Bodyguard"" which surprisingly, was more suspenseful. De Niro's character seems to be acting on impulse, as if he's confused about what his next move will be, which makes him seem a lot less scary."
5,The Fan,"Loved this movie, and had only seen a part of it, so I wanted to see the whole show. Was great!"
2,What's the point,"DeNiro is convincingly crazy and violent, but if you like that, watch Taxi Driver or Cape Fear instead. As I watched this I kept wondering: what is the point of this story? There's no moral, no message, nothing for the viewer to take away. It's not even thrilling or scary, just sad. Haley Joel Osment is brilliant considering how young he is; that's the only reason I give this any stars at all."
4,The Fan: When obsession becomes dangerous,"As a baseball film The Fan delves into the mindset of disturbing fixation, which is perpetuated by a San Francisco Giants fan's personal downfall. The dark mood of this movie is what makes it entertaining, and whilst this may be an uncomfortable narrative for some viewers, there are so many real examples of fans that become dangerous with obsessive delusional behavior. This film exposes some of the perils of celebrity.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Baseball Author"
2,Really weird movie,"The Fan has got to be one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen in my whole life. Robert De Niro gives a brilliant performance as someone who literally goes insane. His character sells knives and when he blows a chance with his son, his only hope is the San Fransisco Giants's baseball team. When they acquire one of the best players for a lot of money (played by Wesley Snipes), he knows that they will go all the way. But when the acquired star fails because he doesn't have his right number and another player does, De Niro's character does the unthinkable. He then becomes obsessed with Snipe's character and just goes nuts. The movie is for one highly unrealistic for soooooooooooooooooooo many reasons, and on another hand, it's just plain weird. It starts off good with a good plot and then it just goes nowhere. A dissapointment."
1,this is a full frame only edition,"Contrary to what the product description mentions, this DVD only offers the full frame version of the film. The original format was 2.35 so you've now been warned: the picture was butchered by Sony on this one!!"
3,"Ok, but not De Niro or Scott's best work","The Fan was somewhat entertaining but also found it to be a bit strange as well. Did not think the role fit De Niro's acting style very much or really Tony Scott's directing style either. I did find it original though and really could not compare it to anything I have seen recently. Maybe with a few adjustments here to there could have been better. Nonetheless, for the average Snipes or De Niro fan, you could find it worth your wild.Peter J. Miller"
4,Underrated Deniro thriller,"Deniro proves once again that he can play a deranged lunatic as well as anything else. Too bad this didn't do too well upon its release back in 1996. I think most moviegoers at the time weren't into this kind of theme. They had seen it before in ""Falling Down"" with Michael Douglas and found it unsettling.But if you happen to be a fan of both Deniro and baseball, then this is for you!"
5,Great movie.,"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. De Niro will surprise you with several twist and turns. Snipes plays the part of a bseball player and it fits him well. If you like De Niro or Snipes this is one to add to your collection.The disc itself comes with both widescreen and Full Screen presentations, so it can satisfy both crowds."
1,is there a robe?,"A friend really enjoys this film, and I agreed to watch it in deference to her insistence that I see it. This is a rare sort of role for Robert DeNiro, although he is always full of surprises. It does not quite work, though, to see him as a crazed baseball fanatic of sorts; it is not quite believable somehow. My dislike for Wesley Snipes contributes to my distaste for the film in general. The only truly redeeming thing here is Benicio del Toro."
2,THE WORST EDITING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED,"I love Robert Deniro and thought he did a great job in this movie but anyone who knows anything about baseball knows this movie is a joke. Whoever edited this movie needs to give anyone who ever saw their money back. For example, there are overhead shots of a football game and the next image is a baseball game. There are overhead shots of Dodger Stadium and then next shot is of a game supposedly going on in SF. In one scene the announcer says the name of the player throwing the ball except the name he says is entirely different from the one stiched on the player's back. This could have been a great film if any effort was put into it."
3,could be better,"not robert deniros best, but it was ok. I thought the movie was on the edge of a bad movie."
4,Creeeeepy,"This movie was completely disturbing. I generally don't go for this genre of movie, but I like the actors so I watched it anyway. I squirmed in my seat the whole time.Robert DeNiro was excellent as The Average Joe who loses touch with reality as he pummels into the pit of obsession. At first I just felt sorry for the guy, but by then end I nearly jumped out of my skin when the phone rang. This is definitely not your typical good-guy bad-guy movie, these characters are all too real.This is a great movie if you want to have nightmares, or be leery of pretty much everybody."
2,"Disturbing, but not good enough thriller","Tony Scott's film ""The Fan"" based on Peter Abrahams's novel of the same name is very disturbing to watch, and the camerawork certainly doesn't help either. Gil Renard(Robert DeNiro) is a frustrated rabid-Giants fan(which isn't true to the novel) and his life is falling apart at the same time that Bobby Rayburn(Wesley Snipes) is in a big slump. Gil and Bobby's lives get closer to intersecting, and a murder occurs which changes both characters and heads the film towards its tragic climax. Gil is too scary to relate to even though we want to. Bobby is too selfish and sleeps around too much to be the hero. Great work by the supporting actors. John Leguizamo and Ellen Barkin do the best in this film as Manny, a sleazy agent and Jewel, a ballsy sports reporter."
1,Absolutely Awful,"A poorly concieved movie, it was unconvincing and predictable. The music of NIN, which in itself is pretty good, does not mesh with the actual action of the movie at all. Don't waste your money on this sleeper."
2,"Promising, But Ultimately Disappointing","Despite some style, rythm and a couple of intriguing ideas, this Tony Scott`s movie soon falls into most of the cliches that trap a typical Hollywood blockbuster.Wesley Snipes plays a baseball star that ends up being the object of devotion and obsession of a lonely, convulted man (Robert DeNiro). The picture builds a growing tension, yet the second part lives on the strenght of chases, kidnappings and tiresome predictability. Nine Inch Nails are a fine addition to the soundtrack, helping the development of the paranoid plot, but the movie is still too flawed and unsurprising to truly engage.Not too good not too bad. Watchable."
2,just entertainment,"Just a good movie with one great actor and one ok. Script was lacking, but wortha 2 buck look."
1,Ehh...,"When I bought this mousepad I thought it was a Mouse PAD, not a piece of plastic. It was rather uncomfortable to use and little different from me just using my optical mouse on my table."
5,Great jazz!,"Lots of harmonica, keyboards and guitar. Better than expected since I bought looking for just the song pinetop's boogie-woogie. Buy more pinetop!"
2,"wife likes the style, finish faded way too quickly","Purchased as a gift for my wife. She likes the style a lot, but the leather finish faded way too quickly to be acceptable. Pretty disappointing for a shoe that she otherwise likes."
2,Shoddy Design,The fan began to lose its electrical connection and shut off while in oscillation mode after just a few days of use. The problem was remedied by securing the cord to the stand with a cable-tie so the cord can no longer pull loose from it's connection. I would think the cord should exit at the base of the fan to avoid this problem.
2,Does not cool enough,"It was easy to assemble but when I turned it on, it did not cool very much. I felt no breeze coming from the front of the fan, only from the sides. Also, the height was too low. It did not adjust to a good height. also the description said there was a remote but it did not come with one."
1,"Never got the magazine, but I did get the bill","As the title says, I never got the magazine so I really can't tell you how good it is....but I can tell you that I did get the bill for it!"
4,womderful,"A very important book ,a real critic to EurocentrismIt gives a meaning to all struggles all over the world to make a new humanitarian society"
4,Good Introduction to England That Includes Less Well Known Areas,"I'm not too good deciphering roman numerals anymore so I could be wrong, but I think this video was released in 1989 so it's somewhat outdated. That really shows up in the segments on London (which I first visited in the mid 70's and then in 2002). It pretty much covers the entire island including Wales so gives a good, if brief, overview of the country. Plus any film that shows the Yorkshire moors with accompanying information on the Bronte family can't be all bad! And when was the last time a travel film showed Shropshire and had Richard Burton narrate the Wales segment!! Very enjoyable and beautiful to look at. It will make you call your travel agent!!"
5,It's sexy yet elegant,"I am a huge fan of Julianne MacLean's novels. Her writing is so smooth yet real, she effortlessly engrosses me in the characters to the end. These characters are truly enjoyable. Evelyn Wheaton is wonderfully awkward and bookish as a young girl, and flowers into a compelling and attractive woman. Her crush on Martin Langdon is completely believable and as it develops into something more, the sexual tension is exquisite.Julianne MacLean seems to capture the period perfectly and yet gives us characters with universal flaws and strengths that I can always relate to. Surrender to a Scoundrel is a delicious and delightful book."
2,A very forgettable book,"This book was just very ""blah"", in my opinion. MacLean utilizes the same plot vehicles familiar to hundreds of romance novels, but with the least amount of depth possible. I really didn't care one way or the other about either the hero or heroine, or the very minor conflict in the book. The reader wasn't involved in the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters on any more than a basic, superficial level. In my opinion, it was like reading an outline of a novel. The only reason I didn't give this book one star was because there was nothing overly wrong or offensive with the story...really, there was nothing there in general. An extremely forgettable read."
3,"""Comtemporary""","This was more of an contemporary story. It was enjoyable. If you enjoy simple pleasant romance then you will enjoy this book. It really was like a breath of fresh air. A lot of time is spent at outdoors and sailing on yachts. The sex scenes were not so hot but there is still great chemistry betweeen the hero and heroine. However, this is the worst one in the series."
2,So so - One you can skip and not miss,"I have enjoyed reading the 5 previous titles by Julianne MacLean in this story line but this one just did not do it for me at all. I found it to be a so-so read that I would not have missed had it never been written. I, like many others do not understand the rave reviews given this title. All I can say is to each his own but I would advise you to choose another of her books to read and skip this one."
3,Maybe I'm just not used to.,"I like the G-Snake for the most part but I compared to an Acoustic Research PR and it sounds a little muted in comparison. Probably the way it is supposed to be but listening to Fleetwood Mac I thought the PR brought out a ""deeper"" sound. One plus for the G Snake is it has a ""smooth"" sound but it didn't bring out the music the way I wanted.Update- I wasn't satisfied with my listening experience and sent back. Researched cables and purchased a Blue Jeans Cable brand and am very happy with the sound quality listening to the same CDs."
1,"My Opinion of ""Learning Computer Programming""","The book starts out appearing to be a good beginning programming book. But it quickly becomes apparent that it is ""C++""-centric. The author states ""you can't do this"" or ""you have to do that"", which is true of C++ but not of other languages. There are also examples of problems and solutions ""explained"" in the book that are oversimplified and have no accompanying code (see the part on merge sort).I think I'll choose another text."
4,Leaves the manual in the dust,"While the manual that comes with Corel Linux is superior to those of most other distribution, it really covers only the basics and presents Linux from within the KDE desktop. If you need more in-depth coverage this ""Official Guide"" will provide information that goes far beyond the KDE desktop: from the first steps all the way to advanced scripting. A look at the newsgroups, however, shows that despite automatic hardware detection some people need advice or trouble-shooting during installation. While this distribution is by far the easiest to install, some hardware (some graphics adapters and sound cards) may cause trouble. Installation troublshooting is the one area where this book could improve. The most frequent installation problems should have been covered in a more extensive way. Otherwise it as an excellent guide that will make your Linux experience a lot more fun."
3,I liked it but it was flawed,While I enjoyed reading this book and now run the OS on my computer this book is not perfect. For one installing a printer took me through three sections with very little information just a sort of run around. I did get my printer installed but it is isn't complete. The Word Perfect 8 is not on the CD as far as I can tell it is a free download but Corel no longer offer it and the company that took over the Corel OS have nothing yet made. Now I find the OS provided very good and the book was fun and relaxing to read. I haven't finished it and I agree with another reviewer that it goes into depth on topics but I think generally it is a bit thin on important configuration of hardware issues. not a bad book I would recommend it if you need to install Linux OS on a Windows hard drive.
2,Don't get it.,The book was fine and in great condition but the CD had a big scratch and my computer couldn't read it. I highly recommend not getting this item unless it's new.
1,misleading title,"Instead of samples of the colloquial language, this book presents standard literary Uighur, termed ""spoken"" only because it is in dialogue format. Has lengthy sections giving technical description of the (literary)language. Overall, a strange combination of meticulous research and glaring omissions. While useful as a reference for the study of standard Uighur, those wanting to learn spoken Uighur should look elsewhere."
4,Must Have!,"As a health care professional (not a medical student or resident), I found this book extremely informative. The information is current in dealing with today's primary care issues. The book's format is easy to access. Information is organized and concise. It provides a quick look at guidelines for clinical care. I would recommend this reference book for anyone who is dealing with general medicine."
2,Excellent product but unfortunately it did not fit my vehicle as promised by amazon!,"overall the shipping speed and package was excellent. product was of A1 quality but unfortunately it did not fit my infiniti G35 sedan 2007 as promised by Amazon. The stock spark plugs are 14mm and the ones I ordered assuming that amazon would know the specs, was 16mm. Unfortunately I cannot use this product and will have to keep it as a back up for another vehicle or sell it if possible. Word of advise more product specs should be avaiable when purchasing."
2,Great Plug,They arrived all floating around in an open package new way to tell if they are cracked. I'll have to see if they work
4,great plugs good for 100000 miles,"these are great plugs. they are kind of expensive, but at least u only have to replace them every 100,000 miles"
5,spark plug,Unfortunately this is the only plug my nissan pathfinder takes. The price couldn't be beat. This plug sells in auto stores for 10.00.
4,"Good product, HOWEVER...","These are great plugs that wear well and last long. HOWEVER, Amazons part matching system says these plugs will fit a 2008 Nissan Altima S 4 door 2.5 liter... they DO NOT. These plugs are far too big to fit. I had to purchase the proper fitting plugs at the dealer at a cost of $16 each (They wanted $20 but I worked them down). The plugs I pulled out had the following markings: NGK DILKAR5A11. The product itself is great, comes pre-gapped and protected for shipment, but don't put too much faith in the Amazon part matching system. Oh, and why so much? The dealer said they have rare earth metals in them and the cost of such metal has skyrocketed in the past few years (They used to be around $11). If you can find the right fitting plugs here, go for it, otherwise you're going to pay an arm and a leg at the store or dealer. Unfortunately, I couldn't spend the time researching, finding and waiting for Amazon to ship them to me."
4,A mixed book at best....,"Some are vampire stories with female characters. Some are lesbian vampire stories. Some are sexy letters to Penthouse magazine with fangs added as an after thought. It is a mixed bag. Now if you don't care if it is a sex story or a vampire story or a sexy vampire story with lots of blood, then you should have no problem with this book. If you are picky then you may not enjoy some of the stories."
5,Sexy stories of sapphic bloodlust ....,Well I guess that says it all!I am not a tremendous fan of vampire stories but I am glad I picked this volume up when I saw it had stories from some favorite authors.There are two stories from MJ Williamz that make this volume a keeper.18 stories in all from authors such as -Jewelle GomezCrystal BarelaBetty BlueJen CrossRakelle ValenciaKristina Wrightand many others.
2,"The epitome of ""scholarly but very hard to learn from""","It's deep on the theory, and every little rarely-used theorem is documents, but examples are very few and so terse they're almost useless. This is a good book if you're a pure mathematician who plans to spend months learning the theory exhaustively. If you're a scientist or advanced engineer who wants to quickly gain the tools that Var Calc has to offer, this is the wrong book."
2,One good song on an otherwise dated album,"This CD is total 1980s overproduced drivel, with the exception of one anthem that carries the entire album. This is supposedly the best-selling CD in Australia's history."
4,Upbeat pop music - catchy and fun to listen to.,Been looking for a copy of this to replace the worn-out copy I brought back from Australia. Couldn't find it until now. I LOVE IT! Don't understand why it never made it to the states.
5,Whispering Jack is something to shout about!,"John Farnham is by far one of the best Australian voices of the decade. This Australian teen idol of the sixties has had his career ressurected in mamoth proportions with the release of this phenominal cd. ""A touch of paradise"" is by far the best track on the album. Farnham's jazzy voice singing the romantic lyrics is the crowning jewel on this release. "" Take the pressure down"" was a hit in Australia and it's not hard to see why. This upbeat song makes you want to dance. This album is soft classic rock with romantic and passionate lyrics sung by an Australian sensation. This is Farnham at his best."
1,... from the horrible bane of real music,"I saw chicks on speed live in hyde park in london during the red hot chilli peppers tour in 2004.Because they'd been booed off the stage the night before in Manchester, John frusciante and Anthony keidis came on before hand and told us to be nice to them.They said that the first band were cool and had cool clothes, make-up, style etc. At that point i realized they hadn't said anything about there music.a techno beat started up and they started flailing their arms. the crowd scratched their heads.The first line was ''can i lick your ice-cream'' and every-one corpsed with laughter.Their music displays to talent whatsoever and dispite the 'popular' opinion, it is by no means artistic. This is a band with nothing to say and all the hype they need not to say it.They even hit paint strippers together.The violinist swore at the audience and they were booed off in just under half an hour.I will give them this-They are true punk."
1,Good ol' chicks!,"You know, i always wondered where they got that music they use in mobile phone adverts, and i think this answers my question.If your into listening to a bunch of incoherant nioses, by all means this is probably the album for you. Just don't be expecting to hear any music.If your buying it because you were at hyde park and you want to remind yourself of when they unfortunatly became a walking joke, don't bother, because the novolty wears off.If you like attending raves and sitting quietly at the back where the ecstacy dealers are and musing over the music they play, this is the album for you. Other wise, run.I'd like to point out that this album shares it's title with a great record by a man called Chino XL.I'd also like to point out how ridiculous the cover is."
4,"serves it's purpose, expensive","What can I say? It holds up my mixer in a rack system perfectly. Seems expensive for a piece of metal, but specialized metal is always that way. Mackie makes really great stuff and this doesn't dissapoint."
3,Ribbon cable too short,Not necessarily a fault of the rotopod adapter tray but more the ribbon cable on the mackie board that runs back the main fader. the cable is about a 1/4 inch too short and comes unplugged just as you get the rotopod into the upright position. I guess I'll have to research it more to see if you can get an extended cable.
2,WHAT A GREAT SET OF PIPES..........................,"I'm proud to say that i have most of Rosies' cds. This perhaps, is not one of her better offerings. It seems that Rosie chose to use a lot of lesser known songs that are out of favor with a lot of the music world. On the well known songs Rosie did a superb job. John Oddo, her musical director, did another super job of arranging. Just maybe one of these days Rosie will break through and sing the songs we are really looking for."
1,The Whating Hour?,"Huh? I've been reading comics for over 20 years. Love Jeph Loeb. But this is the first ever graphic novel I couldn't get through. Tried twice. Thoroughly confusing. Amazingly disjointed. Absolutely a waste of time and money. File this one under ""Doesn't make any sense and impossible to follow so it must be a masterpiece."""
4,"Packed with statistics, analysis, and many useful facts","This book is essential for many fantasy players who want to improve their fantasy team. This book is in depth and helps people decide who to chose in their draft and who to trade. It can also help you determine who to trade for. I bought this book for 15 bucks, a cheap price considering all it's benefits. Buy this book and have fun reading this book!!! The size is big, but it is still useful."
4,Good but not as good,"This book is a must if you want to be able to hold an intelligent conversation with someone about baseball. The book is the same as last year except they seem to of left out some players. I understand you can't include everyone but i feel they left out some top prospects. Also some stats contradict what the writer said, if someone is just getting into stats this can be very confusing. Once again the pecota projections are a little strange and i disagree with many but thats ok. Overall the book is a must and i get it every year but it is not as good as last year."
4,Purity insecurity,"It would seem that Roskind was worried about the purity of LSD after it was made illegal by Uncle Sam. The L.A. Free Press newspaper published reports of free drug tests every week. The tests revealed nothing to fear.""LSD became too dangerous to trust. People switched to the natural psychedelic alternatives like mescaline mushrooms and peyote cactus buttons.""Roskind cites Jay Stevens' ""Storming Heaven; LSD and the American Dream,"" which doesn't agree with Roskind's contention. The popularity of LSD among young Baby Boomers didn't even begin while LSD was legal. For every legal LSD trip, there were thousands of illegal tabs. Barrel acid, windowpane, blotter acid, and microdots in colors from Blue Cheer to Orange Sunshine -- and those varieties were just the ones distributed in the USA."
3,"Decent, but not amazing","Roskind's book is good in content. What I mean by this is that the experiences and the stories are all there, but the writing is not. His interesting (to say the least) experiences of living on communes and tripping out on cliffs are fantastic stories. However they are told somewhat poorly, and contain several grammatical errors.The book is also titled ""Memoirs of and Ex-Hippie"", it is not labeled as an autobiography, which is what it seems to be. Rather than being a compilation of experiences, the book is very nostalgic and reflective. The way Roskind talks about ""revolution"" is also very nostalgic.Overall, the experiences in the book are all there, but the writing is at times very nostalgic and grammatically incorrect, if you're really into all the hippie stuff, this provides good insight into what it was actually like, but you'll have to look past the poor writing."
4,Lynch Makes This Album Worthwhile,"I bought this cd soley because the greatness of George Lynch did all the lead guitar work on the cd. He does not disappoint! He incorporates his own signature licks into every solo on the songs. Some of the vocals are hit and miss, but still not a bad tribute album. Some of the songs covered are the lesser known songs that the Scorpions put out. In a nuthsell, this is a four star cd because of Mr Scary's awesome fretboard work!"
1,"Stung my ears, in the worst way","I am a big Scorpions fan and I looked forward to hearing this tribute album. However, I hated it. I think the arrangements are standard, the sound is bad and the musicianship is un-cohesive. George Lynch is a fine guitarist, but his work in this mix is lost and useless. The vocals were muddy and poorly performed but even if Klaus were on the CD it wouldn't save this garbage."
5,Gragg Does it Again!,"This latest book from Rod Gragg is the best modern regimental history I have read. Written form the perspective of members of the regiment, it offers rich detail and a moving narrative. The photographs bring the text to life. Gragg has written two of my favorite Civil War books, Confederate Goliath (the fight at Fort Fisher, NC) and the Illustrated Confederate Reader (a must read). As a member of the 26th NC (reenactors) I must say that I am even more proud to be a part of the unit. I eagerly look forward to his next book!"
5,A superb novel. . .,"This is another excellent book from Richard Montanari. The suspense in this book keeps you on the edge of your seat not knowing what will happen next. Montanari uses believable characters which makes for an outstanding plot. I can arguably say that ""Kiss of Evil"" is one of the best suspenseful novels ever written. It truly is an amazing book."
2,Booklet of minimal aid and interest,"This is a very small book from a vanity press that has churned out other titles on hemorrhoids and pet care. While the author, an experienced pilot, is no doubt knowledgeable, the book itself is spotty, repetitious, poorly punctuated and just not worth its price. It comes up in searches for books on overcoming flying anxieties, and while it does touch on that topic, there are far better and more comprehensive books to be read for that. In fact, until the section that is dedicated to alleviating those fears, the author demonstrates a rather sadistic attitude about potential plane disasters, so the more phobic will probably want to avoid this book.Also, a good chunk of the text is dedicated to recommending various quackery to relieve the health hazards of flying with flower tinctures and the like, and the writer lets the lecture bleed into the evils of things such as sugar and soft drinks in general rather than sticking to the issue at hand."
3,Expensive but necessary,"Filter functions as advertised, but the cost has gone up with every filter unit I have purchased over the years. With the changes in coffees available (no more Starbucks) I am not sure I will continue with Tassimo when the current filter needs replacement."
2,The end of the road is in sight,"There is nothing wrong with this product. I would buy it if it were reasonably priced. That said, you can't expect it to be since it has not been manufactured for a long time. There are a few on ebay, for around $12.99, but it won't be long before that dries up too. I have been putting pre-filtered or spring water in my machine and will continue to do that instead of paying this price for the filter. If I get tired of that, for the money I have saved not paying this price, it won't be too painful to buy the current generation of Tassimo machine. Still you hate to give up on something that's working perfectly well."
5,you are a life saver!,"I was taken by surprise recently when shopping for my Tassimo filter. I was told that due to a change in manufacturers for the new Tassimo the filters now sold do not work with the original machine! My machine works fine...what to do?Amazon, of course! You guys seem to understand the many ways consumers are left in the lurch ... I really appreciate your making these filters available! At least now I know my machines days are somewhat numbered....Tassimo should have alerted consumer...I mean in this day and age, right?Cudo's! And Happy Holidays!"
4,Cost,"You should not pay this price, you can find them from 9-14 dollars online at other stores. Yes they are getting harder to find so stock up."
1,Amazon does not have this item,"I ordered 4 of these on November 13, 2006. I just got a FIFTH delay notice from Amazon saying that they now expect to ship in May of 2007. Amazon DOES NOT HAVE this item; it is not true that it ""usually ships in 2 to 3 weeks"".Amazon - if anyone is listening - Take this item off your website, please. Manage your suppliers, please."
5,Water Filter,The water filter is working as it was intended. It was quite easy to install in the water reservoir and my wife is able to do it as well.
1,This filter does not fit in a Tassimo water tank.,"I bought it, tried to install it, but it would notfit into the water tank. I'm not sure if Amazon sent me the wrong item, or if there is a special tank required in order to use the filter. Regardless...do more research than I did before buying this item."
2,It's not a fly fishing book,"I was very disappointed with this book. It dealt far too much with the authors philosophy & non fishing life and was, frankly, very depressing. I don't buy books on flyfishing to be bummed out. The title increased the disappontment in that it sounds like a light hearted easy reading fishing book."
2,Not for young fisherman-readers!,"I purchased this book as a gift for my fishing crazed-15 year old nephew. Luckily I read it first. It in NOT appropriate for young readers, and is not about fishing. It is mostly drivl about the author's life."
5,Page Turning,This is one of the best Mandie Books. I've read this series since I was little and this is just another add to the collection of master works. In this story the end will be most suprising and leave you pondering what's next. Unexpected suprise! Tells all about the history of Mandie's Grandmother and Johnathan's father...
5,"Great book, Mrs. Leppard!!!","This book is about when Mandie, Celia, Joe, and Mrs. Taft go to see Jonathan in New York. He has sent Mandie a note telling her that he has found a mystery. But he and his family have gone to Long Island. She has to wait to find out what it is about,and if you know Mandie you'll know how she feels!!I think it was very iteresting how Jonathan's father and Mrs. Taft broke up. I mean,why would Mandie's grandmother care so much about the painting..... Anyway, this book was really good! I would reccomend it to everyone!!"
1,Something old something new......,"If you are lookng for the definitive history of the First World War, keep lookng. This series of books are re-prints of Circa 1920 British home front popaganda. The photos though numerous have been reprinted using a cheap photo-static plate process which does not reproduce the quality of the original volumes. The dust jacket leeds one to beleive that the buyer is getting a moderen top quality book . Do not be fooled."
3,Necessary but eh...,"I like them because I need them in order to do my electrolysis... however they break way to easy because they bend too easily and the ""needle"" gets pulled out of the base way too easily. Yet they get the job done. So yes I buy them, but I also think that they could and definitely should make some improvements on these things..."
1,Please do not buy,I've never seen such a useless product. Very hard to get into the root of the hair and it never never worked even once for me. I would not recommend the whole Deluxe Electrolysys machine product and these tips are of no use.
2,Pick a price,"A few weeks ago I bought these for a total of $7 with s&h. Today they are $10 with s&h! They bend sooooo easy, they shouldn't be so pricey."
3,Not bad- could be better,being a male i have unwanted facial hair around my lips and and neck - plus hair on my eye brows that i clean off.it has very much diminish the amount of facial hair: and yes it is permanent.Although the needle seem to bend much and it takes time.Its best to use this product with salt water - works more efficientlyThis is used for small area- not largeparts of bikini and face that's about it and neck -If you don't want to spend 100$ or more and you have the time then its not a bad product to have for some quick modifications to your hygieneas for large areas- id frankly just suggest to look for lazic removal deals because in my personal opinion no product can do the job of lazic
4,"Not a bad product , but does take time to learn to use it.",I got this about a week ago and at first felt like it was impossible to use. I'm sure Ill have a few scars form the learning process. I stuck with it. Since this is a review for the stylus tips and not the device I will write more there. I haven't had to open the new stylus tips yet.The machine came with two and the first one didn't break I tried to make it longer and pulled it out of the base.So far the second one has done several hundred hairs and counting. I don't find them that fragile. Im jsut hoping the replacement stylus are smaller than the ones that came with it. They work well for thick hairs but very fine hairs are difficult to treat and the follicle is much smaller.
1,Cheaply constructed,Product is way too flimsy!!!! Lousy a!$ product!!!!A complete let down in my book. I would rate this at zero if I could!!!!
1,Did not like this at all,I tried using an at-home electrolysis kit. It was AWFUL!!! Painful! Icky! I sent the kit back and these replacement styluses. I will NOT purchase a similar product again.
1,Terrible writer,"Terribly written. I bet the author wrote the last 3 reviews. To answer your question, this book is out of print because the author does not know how to write a decent story. The content is enough to write a beautiful book, but the author lacks simple writing skills."
5,Excellent Buy!,The seller was very speedy with sending the product. It was in even better condition than they specified. It actually looked brand new and didn't have a scatch or tear on it. All the disc were in very excellent condition and I'm very excited about my purchase.
1,Amazon Sent Wrong DVD,"I bought the series as a Lightning Deal (all 10 dvds at once). Amazon sent the wrong version of Season 4, one released in 2003. That means I have 9 box sets that look the same and one HUGE box set that is completely out of place. I've used Amazon for years, and this is the first time I've been really displeased. I would call Customer Service or send an email, but that doesn't appear to be an option. As I said, I've never had a complaint until now; it would be nice, though, if I could have that complaint handled."
3,Review,"I'm very pleased with my order except that it was supposed to come in the repackaged casing, which does not fold out but is more like a typical DVD case. This came in the original casing which folds out and has a sleeve and is significantly thicker than the repackaged case. Other than that, the DVD's work fine."
1,"DVD Scratched, Not like New","I purchased this Friends DVD set that was labeled 'Like New'. The DVD's skip and freeze. Besides that they took a couple weeks to arrive, but within the allotted time. Recently I purchased some Monk DVD's from a different seller and they came within days. I am very disappointed in the false advertising of the Friends DVD set. This is actually my first negative experience on Amazon."
5,Always makes me laugh,I can't beleive the time less comedy of the series. I can sit an watch an episode a day and they still makes me laugh.
3,worst season of friends,dont get me wrong i love this show this is one of the best shows ever. But this season is the worst season of any show i have ever seen in my life. this season makes seinfield look funny.the cheesy storylines the constant whining of ross and emily. not even chandler is funny in this one. save your money and buy everyother seaosn of friends except for this one.
1,The Least Funny Show Ever,Why this sitcom has become such a phenomenon is totally beyond me. It is in no way funny and the writing is juvenile. The characters are so one-dimensional it's ... I just don't get it. Maybe this is the intellectual low that the TV-viewing public has sunk to. Read a book instead!
1,1 star is too much,This show is so stupid. People in their 30's that still hang out like kids and have conversations about eachothers lives. Boring. I can't wait for this show to go off the air already!
2,"Too many booms, not enough bang!!","Season 4 of the phenominal Friends' series certainly was not the high point of this show's ten-year stint. Briefly, the humor was dry and awkward, with almost every one of Chandler's lines coming totally from some uneasy self-consciousness. Typically, this season's humor made me want to cringe. Clearly, something significant had taken place this season in the directorial area. Also: what was up with all the boom mikes!?"
5,Just what we wanted,Love these shows. My daughter was very happy with the dvd set and plan to order more. Thanks for offering this on Amzon.
2,Friends DVD,"The cover of the dvd series was scuffed up when I received it. Also, as I began the 4th disc of the series, one of the episodes wouldn't play no matter what I did. I am having to send it back for a refund. However, the shipping was excellent and the customer service I received when explaining my problem was very fast and polite. I would rate the shipping and customer service very highly."
5,album of the year,"GREAT lyrics, GREAT production, just a great album. reef has held it down on the battle scene, he also holds it down in the studio. who said battle rappers cant make good music?"
3,Alvin masters songwriting and emotion,"As a huge Dave Alvin fan, I can say that I like hearing the range of all his work, but this album is more of a foundation for the best he's built on - ""King of California"", ""Blackjack Dave"" and ""Public Domain"". I recommend his other stuff, as I think his voice is richer, deeper, provocative - but those who know this guy will go down as a curator and creator of Americana music may like the ride."
4,great book but a bit dated,"great book but a bit dated. Central concepts still apply but it talks about things like ""modems"""
4,Great deal,"According to my teenage son, these shorts are comfortable and the pockets come in handy. They have, after several months, held up very well in the wash, retaining their color and all that special ""dazzle"". Great price: great deal!"
5,Perfect.,"There is character-building behind these somewhat silly but very beautiful stories.These are terrific stories for low-key language arts building -- copy the little rhyme from every chapter, or find the adjectives, or write a similar story about... whatever lives in your back yard. It helps children look around them and notice the unusual features of every-day creatures. Burgess credits ""Mother Nature"" with creating them all, but we know who the REAL Creator is."
3,Not as good as Beatrix Potter,"Reading these books was fun for me as a child but I never enjoyed them as much as Beatrix Potter. The english author wrote in a more mature, fairy tale style that children could still relate to while these books have more of a folk tale background. However, some of Burgesses books are better than this one and I urge you to read Reddy Fox instead of Mr Toad."
5,Best Connector,"These connectors are great. I use a mix of CritterTrail and SAM funnels, but the connectors from both Crittertrail and SAM aren't very secure and for my complicated tunnels, they break apart all the time. I got some habitrail connectors with the maze I bought and I love them. I ordered extra ones to replace the crittertrail ones I'm using in any location that requires additional security. I highly recommend these connectors."
4,"Good book, But not the Best","This was a pretty good book, but the first two were beter. I did really enjoy it, but it didn't capture my attention as much. This one still threw me for a few loops, and I didn't know what to expect, but it was a little slower reading than the other ones. I did really like the character Cogline, that crazy old my was the coolest. I was kind of up set when the Druid Allanon got killed, but I knew it had to happen eventually, especially since he was about 400 years old. Overall, this was a really good book, and a must read to continue with the series."
2,One of the worst,"Did someone say ""agonizingly slow psychodrama""? Well, here it is - with only one point to rise it a squeak above Elfstones: at least the characters go somewhere. Very bad children's literature. That's the one thing Brooks hasn't learned yet: kids don't care about psychological motivation. Keep it out!"
5,"Depressing, but WONDERFUL!!","I have never cried at a book like I did when I read ""Wishsong of Shannara"". I had grown so fond of Allanon, Garet Jax, Edain Elessedil, and the others, I actually cried (I usually don't cry at books or movies). I loved this book SO MUCH!! It was an awesome story. Still, I can't rank it as high as The Sword of Shannara."
3,Other Books,"Bad books need bashing, unfortunately through singing.The descendants of the elf boy etc. in the first couple of books are now needed to save the place from a Tome of Evil. Of course, your manipulative magic druid guy is still around to make suggestions Inheriting magical talents is one thing, but having to sing them? No thanks there, ancestor people. Each book in this series gets worse."
4,Enchanting,"This book is a funny mix of amazingly creative stuff and a sense of deja vu. After reading the other Brooks Books, this one comes to lack originality in such things as characters and enemies being replicas of the ones before, with new names. The storyline is great however, and I love the plot twists involved in following Jair and Brin on their seperate quests, with a dark but compelling ending.That said, some things in the story really seem outa place, like why they have such a hard time getting allies for battle when one generation earlier Jair's FATHER was involved in an epic war with demons. Who forgets that fast? Also, I thought the Lizard creatures were a great addition, but it is spoiled in the fact that they are mentioned only in this book, and then they disappear from the series. It tends to take away from the story when things like entire races can dissappear.Definately worth reading, regardless of the repetativeness, there is enough fresh stuff to keep the reader intrigued."
4,his best,"yes, this is B's best book. best plot, most interesting characters, most interesting quest. the ""sidekicks"" are amazingly interesting. this book is not merred, at leat not as much, by uninventiveness like most of B's book. great read."
1,Utter bile,"Terry Brooks has always been a terribly overrated writer with legions of adoring fans who drool over his every word. Nice for him, I suppose, especially considering that his novels are works of adequate (and occasionaly above-average) childrens fantasy at best.Wishsong is cut from the same cloth, but rather than the ""been there seen that,"" cliched tales of his other works, this one is, well...garbage. Utterly boring, incredibly annoying, and a greater waste of time than the Clinton Presidency.Skip this at all costs."
1,"Hey Terry Brooks, Stop Writing Garbage Fantasy!","As an avid fan of the first ""Sword of Shannara"" series, I returned to the Shannara series after 10 years and was horrified to find that it has mutated into an unreadable mess. If a high school student wrote like Brooks on an English essay, he/she would get an F-. Terry Brooks, what has happened to you? Did the promise of big bucks lead you to sacrifice all of your pride in your literary works and just churn out one insipid junk after another? It's truly unfortunate, I won't touch another of your books again."
3,This book is Brooks's weakest but it is important.,"Wishsong was unfortunately boring and repetitive, but it was definetely needed to continue the series. I have read all of Brooks's shannara books and this one is the worst until about midpoint. Than it takes off if your reading the series you have to get it otherwise it won't be complete."
5,A must for fantasy-lovers!!!,This book and all of Terry Brooks books are fantastic!! Anyone who has read the Shannara series will tell you. If you have read books like the Lord of the Rings series you will fall in love with these books. Terry Brooks works should be right up there with J.R.R Tolkien's.
5,one of his best,"This book was excellent, I've read it several times and I have enjoyed it everytime. I loved all the characters in the book. Brooks does an excellent job of keeping all the books connected, and this is what makes the Shannara series so compelling to read. this book is one of my favorites."
4,thought provoking,"The continuing story of the Shannara legacy.This time, we see an interesting adaptation of the magic that runs through the Ohmsford bloodline. It now manifests itself in the Wishsong! 1 child can create powerful illusions, the other - actual change! You can guess who the story revolves around in the fight against an ancient curse.However - what I liked about this story is the fact that we find out more about Allanon - and the price he has to pay to be an ancient protector and law keeper. We witness too his vulnerabilities as he takes a huge gamble at none other than Druids Keep.An interesting twist to the tale."
4,A worthy end to the trilogy,"Brin Ohmsford has always had the Wishsong, which allows her to control living creatures, but she has never thought much of what that meant until the appearance of the Druid Allanon. He tells her that her gift could save the world, which her family has had a tradition of using magic to do. What neither of them realize is how dangerous her ability will prove to be, and what price must be paid for its use."
4,"I know everyone thinks Wishsong is the weakest, but I liked it.","Yes, it's true there seem to be recurring themes and elements in the Shannara books, but so what. No, it's not the best book ever, but it was as good as Elfstones and better than Sword. I liked the dual story of the brother and sister, and of all the Shannara books this one had the coolest character of any, Garet Jax the Weapons Master (although I would've greatly appreciated if the story had five or so extra pages of Garet fighting the Jachyra). Also, the Moor cat Whisper was a cool and unusual character. I was bored to tears by the LOTR movies and found these to be a much funner fantasy. I have other books I wanted to read, but I think I'll check out some other Shannara books down the road."
5,One of my favorite Terry Brooks books,"I really enjoyed this book. I found it to be very clever and exciting. It may be true that Mr. Brooks books have similar story lines or seemingly recycled characters, but I find that he captures my imagination each time, despite this. His books work for me because they are good against evil, and he sends his characters on impossible missions and they overcome through self-sacrifice and love. Characters are developed thoroughly and the story is fast paced. There is enough romance, danger, mystery and magic to keep me re-reading this book every couple of years, along with all of the other Terry Brooks books I own."
3,Just good enough to keep my interest,"This novel continues the ambivalence that I feel toward Brooks' writing. He is a good writer as far as style, plot progression and character development go. All of these strengths are present in this book. However, his glaring weaknesses of unoriginality and being too simplistic also show up strongly. Brooks is the kind of writer I feel like I should like but he always gives me reasons to view him as just an average fantasy writer. If you've read the series this far, go ahead and read this to finish the triology--just expect more of the same."
3,Entertaining,"I unfortunately had one of the major plot twists revealed to me before I read it, which now probably added to my somewhat dissatisfaction with that person and this book. This, however, is not a negative review. I liked some of the elements of this story very much, but a great deal of the story reflected similar elements in the first book. Which, granted was probably intentional. But instead of the series moving forward, I felt I was often doing a comparison of the first and third book. I really liked some of the side characters in this book, they added color. Unlike a great deal of epic or high fantasy where the side characters have no function other then just rounding out the setting or taking up space. Certainly an entertaining book, but not the equal of ""Elfstones""."
4,Almost as good as Elfstones,"Terry Brooks' style may be a bit awkward attimes, but he has a great sense of storytelling and pacing. He is also a master at depicting desparate situations and heroic feats of selfsacrifice"
2,My least-favorite Shannara book.,"Boring. Repetitive (""a nourishing meal of nuts and berries and cheese"" or some variation thereof, occurs approximately every ten to twenty pages). The author made some attempt to flesh out his characters, but I still found myself not caring if they lived or died, succeeded or failed. Mr. Brooks has written far better than this one."
3,"When it comes to Terry Brooks, this was a bit of a let down","Upon reading the first two Shannara books I feel that Brooks has set a very high and demanding standard for himself. A standard, I'm afraid he failed to match in the wishsong. Although by fantasy genre standards it's an enjoyable read, but if your expecting it to compare to some of his other novels then you will be disapointed. I felt that with some characters (such as Garet Jax) Brooks did'nt allow them to interact with other characters enough and they only seemed intresting when there was action involved. Also I think he did'nt focus enough on Roan Leah, who right from the beginning you feel may be an essential charater, but was later all but forgotten.But there were some good points to the book. The action was pretty good, and the exploration of the East land. And I felt that it rounded the hertitage of Shannara off quite nicley.Its worth reading only if you intend to read the entire series."
4,"Good book, but not number 1.","This book lives up to the rest of the Shannara series, but needs more character development, especially in Brin, and Rone. Slanter, Jair, and Garet Jax were great. THe character interaction was great. THis tale will draw you into the storyline and make you read all of Terry Brook's books."
3,Pedestrian Fantasy Fare,"The Shannara series is famous, and it may be worth reading for that, as it is a big mover in the pulp fantasy circles. Other than that, there is no real reason to read the series. It's not bad, but it's not good. You might be better served reading the Lord of the Rings. If you have already read that, then you have already read a better version of this."
1,The worst of the bad,"The works of Terry Brooks have always stunk. Okay, that's not totally true, they were good when I was 12. This is the worst of those books. Unless you are a card carrying member of the Worship-At-The-Brooks-Alter Society, skip this one and buy the newspaper. It's more boring than The Sword of Shannara, and almost as long."
2,Thank god its over!,"I had a real hard time making it throught the sword of Shannara series I must say. The first book was laughable and the second wasnt a whole lot better. This was the best of the three, but was still just way too vauge and rushed. I hate to keep writing bad reviews for this series, but WOW was I dissapointed. I was expecting an actual trilogy type story, not three seperate stories with one unlikeable character (Allannon)the only thing to connect them. I know Terry Brooks is supposed to be some what of a classic, and no disrespect intended, but I would rather have someone jam an icepick in my retina than read anymore of his writitng. Maybe great for the era it was published, but doesnt hold up to todays standards."
4,Good Singer Song Writer,"I would compare Brookshire to David Gray. He has a good voice, decent lyrics, and catchy melodies. Nice acoustic sound. I would say Better and Mexico are my favorites."
3,Cliff's Quick Review Organic Chemistry I,"Though thorough and accurate, it does not have any sample problems and solutions, which is part of why I purchased this book."
1,misleading title,"the title of this book should include something that reveals that it is based on and promotes evangelical christianity. So, if this is your point of view, it is a great book for you and has some good practical ideas along with the evangelical focus. If this is not your point of view and you aren't interested in preparing your daughter to argue against evolution, if you aren't interesting in instilling in your daughter the evangelical point of view on social issues, then you would probably be more satisfied with a book that avoids this religious viewpoint."
2,Disappointed,I was a tad disappointed at the NON karate movies included in this bundle of movies. At least 1/2 we just action movies. I would recommend that people buy single movie discs instead of this bundle.
3,movies not great,"I bought this for my dad who loves martial arts movies, but he was not happy with it. He is a huge Bruce Lee fan, so maybe he would have preferred only Bruce Lee movies. I know nothing of this genre, but he said the movies were with little known actors and he wasn't too inspired by it's content in the way that he is after watching Bruce Lee movies."
1,Poor-quality transfers of bad movies,"I had high hopes for this based on the cover art and other reviews. I was extremely disappointed when I watched the movies. First, the video quality is terrible. The movies are cropped so that you only see the middle of the screen, but they didn't go to the trouble to pan the view so that you see the action, so lots of action happens off screen. Also, some of the movies are dark, hard to see, grainy, and just generally poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for in some respects. I recently bought the Kung-Fu Theater Collection (10 movies) and have been MUCH happier with those. The video quality is significantly higher in that collection than this one."
2,not what i expected,"Not too happy with dvd's. So far I have seen 4 movies and they are cheap low budget films with little action. Hopefully they will be some good ones in the pack. Unless you get these for very little money, I say skip it."
4,not bad at all!,since buying this product i've been immersed in nostalgia and thinking ...Why isn't there a Kung-Fu Channel some movies were better than others in addition to the quality and some were'nt strictly in the genre but i would recommend it to people who appreciate what Kung-FU movies of a bygone era represented!
4,The Bandits are attacking!,"Of course there's alot of kicking ass but I hadn't realized the depth of plots in Kung Fu movies i.e duty bound honor;over-coming adversity;family loyalty and gorgeous Asian girls who speak in a beautiful(dubbed) Australian accent.Though there are two disks with colored's which should have been left out. I recommend this Kung-Fu collection for its action and strong, in-depth stories."
1,Better copies of these movies are out there,PURE DRECK! The transfers are lousy and the whole set isn't worth even the $4.00 that they are asking for it. keep looking!!!!!!!
1,movie,This collection contain 90% junk movies.Waste of time and money. Quality of the movies same as a plot.Stay away from this collection.
2,Not At All Happy With This One!,"I recently came across a free book ""Double Trouble"" and read the reviews. After reading the reviews, many suggested reading the Coxwell Series before beginning this one. The reviews of ""Double Trouble"" seemed favorable enough. I purchased the other 3 novels before beginning ""Double Trouble"". I'm beginning to think this was a mistake! I just finished reading Book #1 ""Third Time Lucky'! It took me till almost 50% of the book to become interested. The beginning was painfully slow! Now to the part that really irritated me (besides the slow start), the ERRORS! The errors in this book were horrendous! I can't believe I paid $5.00 for a book riddled with errors! I am on Page 2 of ""Double Trouble"" and it already has omitted words and spelling errors! Oh, but shame on me...this is the FREE one! Hopefully, books #3 and #4 are better edited, that's if I ever read those books. Book #2 will be the deciding factor!"
4,Love to read good books,Series of four books - must read them all. I rated them a four stars cause they kept me interested.
2,Kinda boring,This book drug on and on. I almost stopped reading it half way through. I am seriously glad this was a freebie or I would have been super mad.
4,Third Time Lucky (The Coxwells),"I first read this book years ago under, Deborah Cooke's pen name, Claire Cross. I thought it showed a very interesting style, going back and forth between the main character's present and past, and reflecting her perspective, as well as that of the man she cared about. It is the foundation book for the Coxwell series. I enjoyed it very much, and have even reread it a couple of times."
4,Back in the saddle,"When a star quartet of this magnitude is formed the sky is the limit.For some, this second album from the foursome of Jennings, Nelson, Cash and Kristofferson will be another taste of country and western heaven.The single ""Silver Stallion"" is very much in the mould of ""The Highwayman"". The four giants take turns at the microphone, and at the writing, as they journey through the songs about the good, the bad and the ugly sides of the American Wild West.Any good country album turns its attention to the subject of love and this is no exception.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, ""Born And Raised In Black And White"" pits traditional biblical morals against the well-meaning but rugged values considered more practical for a time when a man had to do what a man had to do.An enjoyable sequel."
3,Very poor instructions - nice once it's put together,I considered giving this product two stars - it was that hard to put together. You would think that for a $1200 price tag they could at least label the nuts and bolts and parts. It took almost 10 hours to put this thing together just because NOTHING is labelled. There are conflicting parts lists and I had to go to the hardware store twice to buy bolts that were missing.Once it's put together the machine looks nice and gives a good workout (although that's another area where instructions on using the machine could be vastly improved.) COME ON POWERTEC - make this a perfect ownership experience by improving your documentation.
2,Hard Workout,"If you are serious with working out this machine is not for you. The machine looks bad and I loved the color but that was about what I liked. The range of motion is limited and will not work your muscles correctly. Each exersice attachment will not do the job right. There are better machines out there, just do your homework before commiting to this System it will be well worth it."
2,Moves Data to/from PC But Does Not Synch Data,"Backs up data from Phone to PC just fine (LG VX4650). Does not *Synch* Phone to PC, or PC to Phone. Simply overwrites one with the other.It will only upload the entire contents of the phone contact list (takes about 7 minutes for 434 numbers). It will not upload only changes. Same for downloads to the phone; All or nothing. This also means it is nearly useless for editing contacts on the PC. Takes too long to upload entire database, change one or more items, then download entire database again.There is a ""merge"" feature, but only for two or more databases of numbers in DataPilot's PC database.DataPilot will import numbers from Outlook, but marks each one with a comment ""Outlook Contact."" The comment then gets downloaded with the number to the phone so that every number has the same comment. Stupid waste of phone memory."
5,AWSOME......and oh soo stylish,I purchased this item 2 years ago and had it mounted in my basement bar.... soo kewl. Everyone who comes here wants to know where i got it..Only problem is....the interior light went out.... I CAN NOT find a replacement.. We have taken the burned out light to dozens of retailers... can NOT find a new one..and of course I threw out the original hand books.so if anyone knows how to get a replacement bulb.. let me know..email me at Mfrank010@comcast.netI love this product. fully recommend it....It is so classy.
5,And the music?,"The music is superb in this film, in the style of the old MGM musicals. The songs at the opening and closing perfectly captures the times in which the movie takes place. The composer nailed it. Bravo.Parkinton Weatherbe III"
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"One of the funniest movies, I remembered laughing at it with my children well over 20 years ago, and wanted it for my grandkids,and~~""STILL"" funny!!!"
2,waste of time,"This movie was highly recommended by a friend. It has some notable actors in it. Unfortunately, it was just stupid. Sorry I bought it; and extra sorry I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it."
3,Under the banal-bow!,This is a film better than it's hey-day release back in the early 80's. Zany and funny it show's off Chase and Carrie Fisher in slapstick comedy unlike Ive' ever seen and Eve Arden and Adam Arkin also in an un-derated comic \-caper directed by Steve Rash for sillyness it desreves a viewing before buying but in my opinion worth the money if youre a faN like Airplane! Judge for yourself.
