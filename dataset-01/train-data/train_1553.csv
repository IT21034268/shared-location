2,"Another strange, not-true-to-the-movie soundtrack",The Movie featured several other awesome Led Zepplin songs which this CD omits. Anyone know why?
1,"Nice movie, good choice of classic tunes for the Soundtrack... But an AWFUL soundtrack album! Blah!!!","I watched ""Almost Famous"" one or two times, mostly 'cause I liked the songs selection for the soundtrack very, very much.... However, how can you explain that a 50+ songs Soundtrack played along the movie, result in just a 17-piece OST album?... Why not a 3-CD Box instead, including all the great tunes in the movie???...These guys in the music Soundtrack industry... No further comments! BLAH!!!!"
3,Fun That Selections Aren't So Obvious,"Not a bad selection but I was disappointed that ""Teacher"" by Jethro Tull, which is heard in the background of the very first concert scene, was not included. There are a number of other such songs. Still not bad. Liked that the selection wasn't made up of songs one can still hear constantly on Classic Rock stations. Good movie too, BTW, thx to the delicious Kate Hudson."
3,"Nice, But Doesn't Capture Magic Of Movie","I appreciate and admire the songs on this CD, but they don't capture the magic and awe of Almost Famous. The sequence seems clumsy, and these songs aren't the highlights of the film. (With the exception of ""Tiny Dancer"" -- classic Penny Lane.)I am very impressed, though, by ""Fever Dog"". I didn't realize they had made a full-length version of the song by the fictional Stillwater until the CD arrived.The CD doesn't capture the essence of the movie, it features some great artists and is still worth a listen."
3,Good Starting Point,"Possibly the sweetest movie ever made about rock and roll, and one of the best, this soundtrack to Almost Famous is a solid collection of major and minor ""classic rock"" classics, erring on the side of ""soft rock"". Most rock and roll aficionados own most of these tracks making the soundtrack itself de rigeur (though the sequencing is ace). Still, Almost Famous is a good starting place for youngsters to familiarize themselves with rock history."
5,good,"good cd. also, can anyone tell me the name of the song thats in the movie trailer. not ""tiny dancer"" and not the movie theme, the one in between. i cant figure it out. thanks a lot."
4,Where's Mona Lisa?,"Great soundtrack to a great movie. The only thing that is missing is ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters,"" the Elton John tune playing in the background when the band is in the hotel in NY. It's a great song and the lyrics are perfect for the scene."
5,Makes you wanna Rock Out,Although this music is way before my time I must say that it is essential for anyone who likes good music.Any soundtrack with Led Zepplin the Almond Brothers and Elton John is ok in my book
4,missing some important ones...,"The movie is fantastic and the music in the movie is really what makes Almost Famous the masterpiece that it is. However, this soundtrack leaves off some key songs that were in the film - a volume 2 could easily be produced, and would be welcome!"
4,Should Have Been A Double Album,"There were many songs left off of this CD. To do the movie justice this should have been a double album. Yes it would cost more and I would gladly pay it because I was disappointed by this truncated album. The song in the commercial is ""Go All The Way"" By The Raspberries (A fine song on its own merits."
4,does anyone know the name of the song,does anyone in this world know the name of the song when penny is on the plane and william is running through the airport waving to her. it starts with like an acoustic guitar and a piano...
4,Not Songs You Hear on Classic Rock Radio -- But You Should,"Good compilation albums (whether for a soundtrack or otherwise) are interesting not just for the individual songs, but for how those songs interact, as well. This album does a fine job of bringing together unexpected songs from the 70's (plus the soundalike by the movie's fictional band, Stillwater). These aren't the songs we hear on Classic Rock stations (with the exception of Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer""), but they're the ones we should. When's the last time you heard ""America"" by Simon and Garfunkle on the radio? Or ""That's the Way"" by Led Zeppelin? And David Bowie's ""Waiting for the Man"" is a live version which, I believe, has never been available before.Of course, the dark side of compilation albums is there's always some songs you can do without. But all in all, this one is worth the money."
4,SONG INQUIRY AGAIN,"I KNOW this has been asked a million times, but if ANYONE has any idea what the song is where penny lane is leaving in the plane and william is running in the airport seeing her off PLEASE let me know, also the 'waiting for the man' in the movie is lou reed right? sounds like lou reed but is it? and if so how come his version is not available to download anywhere. and the track of stillwater's ""when love comes and goes"" does anyone have that in full complete version anywhere?"
4,Does anyone know the name of this song?,"I can't remember the scene completely, however I think the song playing in the airport scene was Neil Youngs, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.A great song!"
4,Almost perfekt!,"It's almost pefekt, but i miss some songs. I would really like a vol.2! I have a problem to. I don't own this movie, but my friend does, and I had it at my place last summer. (I watched it like 22 times...) My favourite part in the entire movie is when William entroduces Penny to Russel. But what song is played in the background? I can't figure out! I learned the words by heart but I forgot everything exept the words ""...and I make a lot of money and I..."" If anyone could tell me I would be the happiest girl in LA! I love this film and I recommend everyone who wants to smile and have a good time to see it!"
3,They picked all the wrong songs!!!,"No doubt in my mind that the background music in this movie is quite unsurpassable. But the guys picking the songs for the soundtrack screwed up big time. Being a Led Zep fan, I was really pleased to hear 4 Led Zep songs in the movie. An not the regular ones........, rare acoustic cuts like Bron-Yr-Aur, Tangerine, That's the Way...., and the electric Misty Mountain Hop. But they left all, but That's the Way out of the soundtrack. That's the one complaint I have. But the movie really turned me on to The Who.Rather than buying the album, see the songs you liked most, and download them!"
5,Awesome,"It's an awesome Cd but I'm dissapointed that there is no black sabbath and some other songs they should of put on. I think there should be a second soundtrack, but I gotta say this one rocks! And I think that song playing is ""Teacher""-Jethro Tull if I'm thinking of the right part."
2,Not all the songs from the movie are on this soundtrack.,"Awesome movie. Highly disappointing soundtrack. With all the Zepplin songs, there was only one on the soundtrack. They left the other Elton John song. And Black Sabbath was omitted. In my opinion they left off some awesome tunes and left on some ""less desireable"" ones."
2,Soundtrack,"The cd was described as ""like new"" but came scratched - two of the songs I wasn't able to listen to at all."
4,Help real quick,"Hey thanks to all who have previously answered the most pressing question: What is the song playing when Penny and William leave eachother at the airport. I fully understand now that it was composed by Nancy Wilson. But i was curious if anyone knows of its title (if it even has one) or where i could find it online, or in a search. Thanks"
4,See this Movie,"I know this is a review of the CD and not the movie, but I've got to say that the movie is much better than the CD. That said, the CD, like the movie, grows on you. There are songs on it that I just can't stop listening to. Both the Zeppelin and Beach Boys selections are inspired, and while I'm not a huge Bowie fan, his live song on the CD is damn good. It's a great introduction to classic rock and roll, but for those who are already under it's spell, it's simply a nice addition to any collection."
4,Almost Complete,"I guess with the amount of music covered in the movie, it's probably hard to pick definitive tunes for a soundtrack CD. This should have really been a double album. Great in a ""mix"" on my shuffle mode."
4,Almost Perfect,"The only things missing from this soundtrack are the Stillwater tracks. I loved them in the movie, but missed them here."
5,Continues to amaze me after all these years and multiple readings.,"Some novels you can read once, enjoy them thoroughly, but never feel the need to read them again. Not so with this book. I originally read it when it first came out, loved it, and have read it again many times since, enjoying it anew every time. In fact, I just finished reading it for the umpteenth time, prompting this review.It is definitely among my handful of favorite novels of all time, from any genre. It's absolutely worth seeking out in hard-copy, and if they ever release it on Kindle, grab a copy. I certainly will."
3,A Great Book but....,"Yes, this is a great book. But if you're looking to buy it because you enjoyed the ""Creative Company"", don't buy this book. Because it is the same book, just with a different name and some of the stuff at the back of the other book is at the front of this one. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the bookstore and return it."
4,Outstanding Value,"I'm a beginning guitarist, and this is the first petal I've bought. It has a wide array of sounds, from various effects to various amp types simulated via a DSP. I like the fact that it's either battery or plug-in powered. It's small enough to fit inside my GIG bag, which makes it great for traveling... I can practice with the full range of sounds by plugging my headphones straight in, without having to bring a long an amp. Extremely versatile and satisfying."
4,Nice version of the Brandenburgs,"This album has some interesting arrangements in that using a jazz trio to perform the pieces is an intriguing concept. The performances are strong, and I have enjoyed the CD altogether. I think the idea holds up best in the faster, more energetic pieces like Tracks #3 and #13."
5,Fig jam,"If you like jam but have not tried fig jam, this is the jam for you. It has whole fruit in it and it is not too sweet. It has a wonderful fig taste, which is a very delicate flavor. I love fig jam and this is the best one on the market."
2,Written by a lawyer . . .,"I bought this book hoping to gain some insight into howto analyze the four options you have at the end of a lease.Unfortunately, I am still looking for that insight.This book has lots of legal insight, with 38 pages allotted toRegulation M, the regulations to the Consumer Leasing Act.This book was helpful, although incomplete."
3,Compelling and historically significant woman,"While other biographies of Catherine the Great may be more sensational, this comprehensive telling of her life is engaging without reading like a tabloid. With a life as entertaining as this, there is not much need for sensationalizing.;)Cronin expertly delves into the life of one of Russia's great rulers. His telling of her life gives glimpses into other parts of Russian history. The Russian Orthodox church, the lives of royalty, the intertwining of art and politics. The pains of her odd marriage, her ascent to the throne and her need to become her own master will strike a chord with many women.I recommend it for anyone who would like to get to know this unusual and powerful woman."
4,This is HOT !!,I live in a small apartment and only have a kitchenette this hotplate is the stuff. It gets hot very fast and looks great
5,Holy moly this thing is cool!,"Read reviews and chose this one. Came without damage.Plugged it in and put theNordic Ware Commercial Induction Fry Pan with Premium Non-Stick Coating, 8-Inchon it, plopped a can of split pea soup in there (yes, I know it is a saute pan and not a soup pot but I was hungry and that's all I had in my office to test this all with). Pressed the ""on"" button and while I was looking at the manual to determine what to set it on, I noticed that the edges of the soup were already boiling -- this was seconds later. SECONDS.The only fault I'd give this is the (tiny) manual itself - it explains the difference between power mode and temperature mode operation, but there are no guidelines on which to use and why. I guess that is what Google is for.It also comes with a cute wallet sized magnet that you can take to your local pots and pans store to see if any will work with the induction top.All in all, two thumbs up or AAAA+ or whatever meme one uses with Amazon."
1,"Surface Came Cracked, Twice","Ordered this item from amazon.com. When received, the cooktop surface was already in pieces. I did not think much of it and ordered a replacement. But then the second one also came cracked, on exactly the same spot on the cooktop surface. I decided that I didn't want to take a third chance with this stove and returned it for a refund. I understand this is more of UPS's fault. But if the item is cracked so easily with descent packaging protection, it does say something about its lack of quality."
1,Arrived Broken,"I received this yesterday, and when I plugged into the outlet, it flashed an ""E3"" error. My attempts to adjust the settings by pressing the control keys on the touch panel failed as well, as it kept flashing the E3 errror and beeping. It's a highly disappointing product."
2,digtal buttons for increasing temp. has gone bad,"This cooktop is slightly over a year old and the incremental button for changing the temp. or 1-10 scale has gone bad. It still works and starts out on 5 and can go down to 1 but you cannot go back up to 5. You must turn unit off and then it goes back to 5...So,the unit still works for the most part but it has become defective and perhaps will altogether die.I think it has been a great unit for boiling pasta and doing certain things but lacks the ability to have simmering capabilities because of the temp. change from 1-2 or 2-3. For best simmering,one needs an adjustable flame. Period"
4,Exceptional!,"Very good kitchen tool! Small, very quick ! ENERGY EFFICIENT! I haven't used regular stove to since arrivad ! (But make sure you use the correct type pans!)(I did/do!)"
5,Awesome Product!!! Just Purchased A 2nd One!!!,"Had one for 1 year and have been using it for everything..from boiling H20 to making great red sauces...to frying bacon!!! wanted a 2nd one so I could cook things together...haven't been using my gas burners...this has awesome control!!! immediate response!!! also great price!!! works great with my le creuset cookware!!!Update: I bought 2 with the intention of repairing gas stove...never repaired it! Love them and cook everything including bacon....a slight learning curve but the control and responsiveness is amazing!!!! I placed a silestone on top of the stove and there sit my 2 Max Burtons!!! Live in San Antonio, TX....these do not heat up the kitchen!!! I cannot understand any of the complaints???? The humming? don't get it...always will be whiners I guess....."
2,Small cooking area,"The cooking area of the burner (the section of the pan that actually gets hot) is only about 5"" across, and, at least with my cast-iron skillet, it really doesn't spread. I tried putting a couple of inches of water in the skillet, and it boiled reasonably fast, but only in the small area. I waited several minutes, and only that area was boiling. This would make sauteeing or frying almost impossible, since food that's not in the center of the pan won't get cooked at all.On the plus side, the controls are reasonable (though having to press a button repeatedly to adjust the temperature each time you turn the thing on is likely to get old fast), the power is adequate, and the noise isn't bad. However, the small cooking area makes it almost useless unless you're working with a very small pan. I have returned the product."
4,As advertised [mostly],"These induction cookers have some really great application, if you need one.If you want to cook where there isn't cooking facilities, this is the ticket.Don't try too large of a heavy cast iron skillet, it will overload."
1,takes forever to boil water,"will not perform as advertised,it takes twice as long as stove top for tea kettle made for induction cook tops.and wont even boil a big pot of water."
2,The E0 Problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The LED indicates E0. So I look for the solution in the instructions...But after I operate the remedy, it still doesn't work and appears E0!!!!! How to solve this problem????!!!!"
2,too noisy,"This hot plate heated a pot of water somewhat faster than a gas stove would, but made a high pitched noise when on the high setting. My family complained bitterly and forced me to return it. I liked the advantage of its energy efficiency but was voted down."
4,induction cooktop,"good service. interesting way to cook. the cooktop heats up quickly, but food tends to cool rapidly, as soon as the wok is taken off the cooker. i'll need more time to get used to using the cooktop before substituting it for a gas or electric top."
1,Don't buy it,Max Burton 6000 Induction Cooktop (110V) ULThis item is less than desirable. The digital display was not fully functional on arrival and continued to go downhill. The plastic surface is insubstantial. After only 3 uses the top cracked in two places. I am arranging for return and refund.
3,Great for high altitude boiling,"We live at 7500ft. altitude. This does a great job getting pasta water ready. It seems too hot for some things and I'm always charring the omelets even at a low setting. Our dog hates the sound and has to wait outside when I'm cooking. In the summer it was a great outdoor kitchen burner. I could take vegetables from the garden and blanch them for freezing without going in the house. It's cheap enough, I would buy another."
2,Serious Quality Control Issues,"Like several other reviewers, my unit arrived broken. It did not power on at all. I researched portable induction units pretty thoroughly before I chose this one, and, I guess, for the price, you won't get a better one,If you're lucky enough to get one that works.If you have the time and extra money to risk that your first try at getting one of these will result in getting one of the nonworking units, you may want to go ahead and try it. You can either spend twice as much for a brand that is more likely to work the first time you order it, or you can spend less and deal with the potential inconvenience of having to exchange this one."
2,Didn't get it done...,"I purchased the Max Burton 6000 Induction Cooktop because my gas range takes forever to boil water compared to my electric range. I did a side-by-side test, cooktop vs gas range. Identical pans, same amount of water at room temp. The two pots came to a boil within seconds of each other.The quality of the cooktop was fine. It just didn't do what I purchased it for so I returned it. Would have kept it if I'd needed a spare cooktop."
4,Great for making omelets,"I got this cooktop for making table side omelets, and it works great for that. I use it with an All-Clad 8"" non-stick fry pan for making omelets, frying eggs, and cooking breakfast meats. All of my All-Clad cookware that will fit on this cooktop works great with it."
3,Max Burton 6000 1800W Induction Cooktop,"I ordered this product as a gift for a friend. It was very easy to process the order. It was packaged safely and arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. After opening it I noticed a warning that it should not be used by someone with a pacemaker. My friend has a pacemaker. It would have saved me a lot of trouble if that had been noted in the description. However, I returned it and got a refund minus what it cost to ship it back. Other than being out-of-pocket for the shipping and disappointed at not being able to give it to my friend, I was satisfied with my Amazon transaction."
4,Help!,"Rating this product is tough. When it's good, it's very, very good. When it's bad, I know I'm doing something wrong, but what? My ""good"" pots and pans are packed away. Slowly, very slowly, I am finding pots and pans that will work and that are affordable at garage sales, at second hand stores, etc. I carry a magnet with me at all times.The instructions that came with the unit warned about putting anything ""too heavy"" on the cooktop. How heavy is ""too heavy?"" I've been afraid to use my cast iron stuff which is heavy even when empty. Yet, my magnet loves cast iron. Obviously, my problem is with the information provided with the cooking unit, not with the unit itself.We beginners need help and expect the manufacturer to provide it."
4,Works and priced right,"Could be a five if you consider nothing near it for price. Arrived safe even though almost no filler between product box and shipping carton. Bigger than I expected, if space limited check dimensions, 14 deep is actual unit; cord comes straight out back and is stiff, add a couple inches if you need to turn cord. Actual height is 2 3/4"". Manual and controls do take some concentration the first few times. You'll get it. Light is on when unit is off. Fan runs to cool unit after heat shuts off. My primary application was cooking pasta-way easier than my gas stove top."
4,Almost perfect.,"I like everything about it except the temperature control. The sizeable jumps between levels (one is 20 degrees, three are 30 degrees and five are 40 degrees) cause me to often change settings between the two that get me the desired temperature. This is not a major problem but is the only thing that prevents me from giving it the full five stars."
4,So Far We Like It,"The price was right and the reviews were good. Yes, it gets very hot quickly. Due to the size for surface cooking, it was limiting when we were searing a large cut of meat. With a little maneuvering -- had to brown the meat in sections, we were finally able to get this done. Our main use for this induction cooktop is to use it outside on the patio so that we don't get a grease laden house. The controls are plastic and are probably not the best quality however they seem to be sturdy enough. Frying oil heats up quickly but you must crank it up to the highest temp. Managing the controls for the right temperature can be a bit tricky and inconsistent. Just need to practice this more."
3,Dead after 5 months,"We wanted to try induction cooking and this was a good way to do that inexpensively. After 5 months of daily use, the unit shorted out and did not heat our pans although the fan and controls appeared to be working. Other than its self destruction, my only criticism of the unit is that I could not control the heat well enough to produce a low simmer for stock, maybe because we never figured out how the ""Power"" and ""Temp"" controls should be used. As for the features of induction cooking we liked: it turns off when the pot is removed, the surface is not hot, and you can hear the unit when it is on - all safety advantages over our regular burners."
1,Great Product - But Heat Control Failed after a few months,"Bought the Max Burton 6000 1800-Watt in Feb 2011 after quite a bit of research.Love it for stir fries, steaming veggies, making soups.I especially love that it uses much less electricity and does not heat up the room.Unfortunately the pressure control button to reduce heat setting just stopped working.Very frustrating, as makes unit basically useless after only six months of use.It did not fail during the warranty period, so now I have paid more than my electricity savings.Seems to be a problem of poor manufacturing. Otherwise great design, easy cleanup, fast heat.Max Burton 6000 1800-Watt Portable Induction CooktopVery disappointed."
2,It's OK,"We are disappointed. It was not as powerful as we thought it would be, so it didn't bring the temp up like we needed. The heating area is small. We'll keep it for taking on trips and use it as a hot plate on the patio, but it was not what we expected."
4,Surprising!,I love it! It cooks fast and there's almost no heat out into the air. Cons: Levels are digital 1-10 -- would have preferred a dial; the glass top has already scratched and the base is not very easy to clean. I got mine for $80 - well worth it.
2,It works but not with aluminum bottoms on stainless steel cookware,"This works but not practical all the time. we got this and tried few stainless steel pots we have,they don't work as the bottoms are aluminum. (even if the pot looks like steel it is not !)most pressure cookers from India are aluminum too. so they won't work.found one frying pan that is iron ( steel ).it heated up so quickly at the bottom the oil started smoke.The sides of the pot had water drops that never evaporated.we wanted to make sure the pot is clear of water droplets but no luck! unless you are wiping them yourself with a paper napkin.Tried using this to fry stuff in oil.The oil gets too hot too quickly unless you really use lower setting (like 3).What ever you are frying gets done too quickly, chances are inside is not cooked.food needs to cook slowly to get its insides cooked and its taste!.so overall I am not returning this but intend to use it for emergencies once in a while only."
3,the fan on this portable cooktop is annoying,"Great item, except the fan is loud. It runs the entire time the item is being used. Pretty annoying. But it cooks well, with a cast iron pan."
5,PAUL'S REVIEW,Max Burton's Induction Cooktop is one of the best small appliances I have ever purchased. I highly (*****) recommend it!
1,Piece of Junk,I purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter. When taking it out of the package to look at one of the legs broke on the horse. This was inexpensive but I would have been better off giving her a quater to play with. What a disappointment. This was a piece of junk like you get in a quater machine at the grocery store. Very disappointed. Worse item I have ever bought from anywhere.
2,I Could Take It or Leave It,I didn't get this series and stopped reading after the second book. I absolutely LOVED the Black Company...maybe my expectations were too high.
3,improvement over first book,"Note that this is now back in print as part of the omnibus edition A Cruel Wind, covering the first Dread Empire trilogy.I enjoyed this this more 'all night falling,' probably in part because the characters focused on were much more sympathetic or at least understandable to the reader. focus on ragnorson, with lesser involvement of mocker, along with others introduced in this novel, and almost nothing from varthlokkur, probably helped this a lot.dealing with political strife in the dread empire, and political and military issues in lesser kingdom and the machincations of bin yousif, it is certain an enjoyable read."
2,Dud,"For collectors only, this is not a very good album. The mix is muddy & the material presented was hardly worth the effort. Save your cabbage & pick up one of JA's studio efforts.For a similar recording you could record some drunken garage band with a radio shack tape recorder & end up with something of the same quality."
4,Still a fair amount of audio defects,"I'm a huge Jefferson Airplane fan. Over the years, I've bought just about all their albums multiple times-first as an LP, then the original CD, then the remastered CD, etc.""Bless Its Pointed Little Head"" is one of my favorite live albums, but they have still missed the mark in the remastering. There is some improvement-the instruments sound clearer and less compressed, but parts of it still sound like an almost skipping record. This is especially apparent in the quieter passages, like the beginning of Bear Melt (which I absolutely love, unlike most people) or Today. I'm guessing that this may be a problem with the master tapes or the recorder used-remember this was from 1969."
5,THIS IS LIVE PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC!!,"In fact no group like them better represented the PSYCHEDELIC 60's SOUND!Just listen to tracks like ""FAT ANGEL"" or ""BEAR MELT"" to understand what GREAT BAND JEFFERSON AIRPLANE WAS.Jorma and Jack are a perfect instrumental combo, and Spencer Dryden is great too, giving to the band a very unique sound.On this remastered version you'll find some good extras: ""WATCH HER RIDE"" is beautiful, with Jorma's solos rocking around, but ""YESTERDAY"" is not so good, but is of course a piece of history.THIS IS THE BAY AREA SOUND, GUYS!!!"
4,jack casady is the man,"This album shows what was the real force behind the band. Can anyone think of a rock group before them to build its sound around the bass? Jack's playing on this record is extremely strong. Its no accident that this record was mixed with his instrument making up half the volume, the rest of the band the other half. His playing defined the group, and gave it a foundation which they could swirl around. When I first heard this record, Balin and Slick's voices seemed to me to be shaped to resemble dueling Yardbirds-like guitars, and they still do. The whole group is tight on this record, and very attentive to each other. You just don't hear this kind of work on other SF groups from the period-a mix of well-rehearsed instrumentation and improv. They rocked much harder than the Dead or other outfits.I just wish that Jorma's guitar work were more consistant here, my only real complaint."
5,Great Live Plane,"The Airplane has never flown higher than this live show from late 68 recorded at the Fillmore. Highlights include the Bluesy Jazzy number ""Bear Melt"" and an improv reading of ""Somebody to Love"". A nice addition to any 60s fans CD collection."
5,I love these CDs,"For anyone that wants to donate to a worthy organization, and get great Broadway Voices, this is the CD to pick, actually all of the Carols of a Cure CD are really good. This one features a really good song sung by the Phantom cast, including Brad Little, Beth Southard, and Michael Shawn Lewis. I really enjoy this Cd. [...]"
4,Seemingly simple folktales with a deeper meaning,"This book is a treasury of Yiddish folktales just like my grandfather used to tell us. They seem simple and obvious at times but they always contain a deeper interpretation when considered through the eyes of our ancestors and their concerns. The tales are thought provoking at times and humorous at others. My only wish is that there were more allegorical tales which are my favorite, also, it might be nice to have a little author commentary on the origins and meaning of each or even just the major lessons. The artwork- jewish folk art is also beautiful and fitting. Altogether a great book for bedtime stories!"
3,Somewhat frustrating,This game is very repetitive and can only be played for a short time before you get frustrated and/or bored. Game has many puzzles a plus but many of them depend more on skill with the buttons than brain power. Minor aside the physics of some of the setups/solutions is incorrect. I have enjouyed the reasoning puzzles but I think overall it is a 3
4,Very challenging game,"This game can get super hard. At times it feels more like an exam than a video game, but if you are into challenging your mind, check this one out. It can be aggrivating, but equally rewarding when you solve puzzles quickly and efficiently. Not for mindless play - you need to devote your brainpower to this game."
2,not as good,"played PQ1, actually still play. #2 just is not as much fun. controls can get out of your ""control"". set up is smaller & hard to see. all in all,really a little too different from it's predessor."
1,GROSS! UNENTERTAINING!!!,"This video was a disaster! As soon as we got it from our library, it started skipping and not working. As an eleven year old child, I don't reccomend buying this video since it's always broken!"
5,Magic Once Again!,"After listening to Russell Watsons Cds ""Voice"" and ""Encore"" I had to purchase ""Reprise"" It is even better than the others. His voice is amazing and his change of styles adds a wonderful variety for the listener. I saw him on Good Morning America two years ago and fell in love with him! He's so talented and quite charming. I'm anxious to see more of him in the US."
5,Doesn't get any better than this!,"Watson is in top form, with stellar arrangements by William Hayward and co.As a bonus, the additional tracks on this CD include a sensational duet with Cleopatra.It doesn't get any better than this!"
1,Doesn't worth the price,"This cd is on sale at full price. I don't think that's reasonable, for the performances recorded on it are very bad. In fact, this cd contains some of the worst singing ever put on records.This is a great disappointment, as there has been so much hype surrounding the singer that some people maybe misled into thinking that the performances on this cd must necessarily be great. No, they just aren't, and the truth is immediately evident from the first track.This cd cannot be recommended to anyone, especially when it is so unreasonably priced."
1,Ugly singing on a poorly produced album,"Put it simply, this poorly produced album contains some of the most ugly singing that one can hear on commercial recordings. It preserves the ill-considered endeavours of a singer who hasn't the voice, range or technique to do the music justice, but then calls himself the ""people's tenor"" and proceeds to make a vocal fool of himself.Of the cross-over singers, Bocelli, Safina, Frangoulis and Grosban and infinitely superior that the singer featured on this recording."
1,A listening ordeal,"There's no pleasure to gain buy listening to this album. The singing here is unspeakably ugly and hard on the ear. The performances are monotonous and stylistically unvaried. Even the voice itself seems to have deteriorated markedly over the past 2 years. While some people can still cling onto their 'idol', it is clear that Russell Watson is already a spent force, at least as far as his singing is concernd."
1,Ragged and unpolished singing,"On evidence of the ragged and unpolished singing on this album, one can conclude that Russell Watson is merely an amateur as far as singing is concerned. In fact, his vocalism can easily be surpassed by even high school students who sing in choirs.Nothing of much interest here. Can't recommend it to others."
1,The worst of the three,"Russell Watson has so far released 3 full albums. Of those, the first is the best, as it captures the singer's voice as its freshest and that the choice of music is also interesting. The 2nd album, alas, shows a marked deterioration is both the quality of the voice as well as the standard of performance.Unfortunately, things continue to dive in this 3rd and latest album. The singing here becomes so bad that Watson cannot even hold a sustained note steadily! That really is unsatisfactory.I would be more responsible of Watson if he can go to a good teacher to train up his voice instead of trying to earn more money but turning out more albums when his singing is deteriorating at such an alarming rate."
1,A vocal farce,"This cd is disappointing as the singing here is technically and stylistically a complete farce.Russell Watson obviously does not have the technical skill to do the music justice. He apparantly is also unaware of the different stylistic demands of the pieces. As a result, he can only sing all the songs in a similar generalised manner.Furthermore, the singing also lacks charm. This album is a complete write-off."
5,Incredible experience,"To any Russell fan, this album needs no explanation. To anyone who hasn't heard it, you're missing out on an incredible experience. Watson's voice is unbelievable.I discovered his voice many months ago seeing a British all-star cast broadway type show and Watson came out an stole the show with his rendition of a song from Phantom of the Operar. After that appearance, I've been buying every CD of his.I play with a rock-band part-time at night. Every night after the gig I would come home, put on the headphones, and revel in this CD's beauty. Like my dad used to say; they don't make 'em like this anymore."
1,This is not a tenor!,"This is not good singing, and in particular this is not classical singing.Shame on Decca for listing this autrocity in its catalogue among the world's greatest. A third-rate opera company would not even consider producing an opera with a ""voice"" like that. It's untrained and ugly. He does not even get the lyrics right most of the time. But this fellow does have a good manager. Better than anyone I've ever known of. He or she ought to be listed on the cover which boasts a smug Watson enjoying a lifestyle you've paid for."
1,No appeal at all,I find this recording of be of no appeal whatsoever. The performances are boring to the extreme. The singing is so unsubtle that it's like having a person screaming at you for a full hour. What a painful hour of listening this is!
1,Unsuccessful cross-over,"I don't think this is a successful attempt at cross-over. The reason being that Russell Watson does not have the technique, charm and charisma to make the music appeal to a wider section of the public. He has a face, yes. But other than that, he has practically nothing to offer. And when one is merely listening to a cd, this is clearly not sufficient. Not recommended."
5,It's glorious,"The one thing that struck me after listening to the first song on the CD was that Watson has a glorious voice and must enjoy singing, in addition to having fun making this album. No matter if he's singing classical or pop. What tells me this is the sound of Watson's voice. He doesn't act these songs, nor does he live them. He just lets the fun be what it is supposed to be.""La danza"" and ""That's Amore"" are two of my favorites, because he let's it all loose. He's out to have fun, he's out to have a ""swingin' time, either classical or pop. He's out to just sing a song the way the way it's meant to be sung -- from the heart.It is music, sweet music that cannot be restrained. It's a nice addition to your compilation. Keep it close to your ""live"" CDs. It's glorious."
5,Add this CD to your collection,"Russell Watson didn't fail with the songs on this album. His voice comes in clearly without losing the orchestra's appeal in the background. The album includes 17 great songs, including my favorite ""the Living Years"".The songs cover a wide range of musical genre such as ""Granada"", ""That's Amore"", ""Ave Maria"", ""Nothing Sacred"", ""La danza"", and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Few albums compare to this one in selection for covering such diverse music and songs.If you're looking for one Watson album for your collection, I highly recommend this album."
5,A masterpiece CD,"This is my favorite WATSON cd. At last Russell is emphasizing classical music and against a beautiful orchestral background of strings, RUSSELL has never sung better. His voice really comes across beautifully.The question remains if he will continue to concentrate on classical music. Although he is brilliant with the pop tunes, a mystery to me is with that glorious tenor voice, he doesn't utilize it more often than he does.My favorites on this CD are: TORNA A SURRIENTO, SANTA LUCIA, RECONDITA ARMONIA, LA DANZA AND CORE `NGRATO. You've got to buy this one to experience what a great singer Russell Watson is. Every song comes out well in this masterpiece CD."
5,Something for Everyone,"This collection catches some of the best of Russell Watson, where he is rapidly approaching the great classical singers and is already there as far as pop songs go.""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a rockin', swingin, beautiful and angry. You get some other fine pop songs (""Nothing Sacred"", ""Living Years"") and several classical tracks such as ""Santa Lucia"" and ""the Pearl Fishers' Duet"".It is a great place to start understanding the point where Watson is reaching out, successfully, to people who are not into classical music."
1,A singer without a voice,"Russell Watson no doubt has good looks. Unfortunately, looks are irrelevant to a singer, especially in audio recordings.Watson evidently lacks a ""voice"" here. By this, I mean that his voice is in a very poor shape - narrow range, insecure intonation, raspy high notes, lack of flexibility etc. etc.His singing fails to satisfy on recordings."
1,What a bad album!,"What a bad album this is!I never imagine that any singer of classical music can be that bad. Or maybe Mr Watson simply is not a singer of classical music. He only pretends to be one and then made such a sad showing.Honestly, I think buying this album is just a sheer waste of money, although it has dispelled, for me at least, all those exaggerated myths surrounding this singer."
1,Safina and Frangoulis are much better,"As the title to my review suggests, Russell Watson's performances can't be compared with those by Safina and Frangoulis, who are real tenors with great voices, true artistry and great charisma. By contrast, Watson's performances are very much below par."
1,Appalled by the standard of singing,"This album isn't cheap, and I therefore have high expectations on it. Yet, I'm severely disappointed by what I heard here. The singing is simply atrocious, one of the worst that I've ever heard on recordings. I'm angry at all those hyperboles surrounding such a voicless and talentless singer!"
1,I like Frangoulis much more,"I like Frangoulis much more. He sings much better than Watson and has a more handsome look. As far as Watson is concerned, he is just one who keeps on shouting at the top of his voice. His singing is uncommunicative.A one star recording."
1,Watson is terrible,"I will only give this recording 1 star at most, for the singing is very bad indeed. Russell Watson just bellows his way through the music. Such crude singing his to be heard to be believed."
1,Worst cd that I've listened to,"This is definitely, and by far, the worst cd that I've listened to. The choice of music is unimaginative and the singing is simply gross! I would in particular complain about the abysmal qualities in Russell Watson's singing, or perhaps yelling. His performances in all the tracks are quite appalling. There're no redeeming features that I can find."
1,A disgraceful recording,"How can Russell Watson call himself a classical singer when he simply doesn't have the voice and technique to be such?How can Russell Watson can himself a tenor when he doesn't have the vocal range for that voice type?How can Russell Watson call himself the ""people's tenor"" when he sings so badly? Does he think that ordinary people who have little knowledge of classical music deserves to be treated with performances which are of inferior quality?All I can see and hear is a very hypocritical attitudes towards music and performing!"
1,A vocal wreck,"This album is unacceptable, as the singing is very bad indeed. Russell Watson is little more than a vocal wreck here, and his singing gives no pleasure at all. He dodges almost all the vocal challenges presented by the music, and he is also unable to make the music alive.As a result, it's a most boring album which makes painful listening."
5,A must have CD,"""Reprise"" is the third Watson CD I've purchased (I only recently got hooked with Watson when a Watson-crazy friend of mine played Voice for me and I was knocked out! How did I miss out on a such a brilliant singer these past years? I guess he's considered classical so I never paid any attention to that kind of music. Anyway, Watson is quite a singer.You can just feel the sweat and pride that went into this production. The whole thing just creates excitement, beauty and swing!!! My favorite moments? Of course, his pop tunes such as ""Nothing Sacred"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and a knockout ""The Best That Love Can Be"" with Cleopatra.But what made skin just goose-bumpy all over were his classical ""Granada"", """"The Pearl Fishers' Duet"", ""Recondita armonia"" and ""the beautiful ""Core `ngrato"" which made me just whimper. All and all, this is a ""must buy"" CD."
5,"I own 850 cd's, this is one of the best","I own over 850 CDs in all kinds of genres. Many of them are considered ""great"" albums. Although I haven't heard every CD in the world, I'm inclined to think this is the most beautiful album ever made.I could analyze why I like this record so much, but I don't want to -- Like a water to a sponge, I'd rather it just soak into me and fill me up with each listen.If you're looking for a recommendation I'm giving it and I am not overstating anything. You'll just have to hear it for yourself to understand why, you just might, once in a while, get results that rise to the level of this record."
5,one year later,"I have just read ALL the reviews for RUSSELL's ""REPRISE"". Well it is nearly a year since I bought my first copy, since then I have got 2 more. They are never off my C.D. players. I never tire of RUSSELL singing, if I do change the C.D it is only to put on "" THE VOICE"" or ""ENCORE"". CORE N'GRATO makes me go weak at the knee's and AVE MARIA and POURQUI ME REVEILLER are so emotional I always end up crying even after all this time. At the moment RUSSELL is ill with a throat infection and has been told NOT to sing for 2 MONTHS, so I hope all his American fans will still support him if he can't visit them for a while. He had to cancel the concert that was being recorded for his new DVD so we will just have to wait a bit longer. RUSSELL is the ONLY singer in the world that can make my heart pound while listening to him singing. SANDY from Scotland.............."
1,A disappointment,"After reading all those praises of Russell Watason, I'm disappointed to say that his singing does not live up to expectations. His voice is of ordinary quality and it is clear that he does not have a great technique. His performances are also charmless. Certainly not as good as some people say."
1,Unworthy of the price,"This album doesn't worth its retail price at all, because the quality of the singing is very bad.As some other people have suggested, Russell watson cannot even hold a note properly. There is no room left for interpretation.Terrible singing, terrible performance!"
2,Musical rubbish,"This is music at its worst, the equivalent of musical rubbish! None of the track is even competently sung. Most of the performances are so bad that they amount to sheer noise pollution. I won't recommend it to anybody with a sane mind!"
5,A hurricane! 5 Stars,"This is a great CD! And I usually don't use exclamation points. Each song (even the cool, rock songs) hit me in the gut. From ""Granada"" to ""I Don't How I Got By"" to ""Questa o quella"" to ""That's Amore"". It's fabulous.You'll remember every note, every lyric, everything! Watson's voice is something to behold. Get this, and be Human. This set is a hurricane!"
1,This is the worst of Watson,"This album is really the worst of the 3 produced by Russell Watson. The voice itself sounds uncomfortably strident almost all the time, and Watson can't cope with quite a number of musical phrases. In many instances, Watson's singing is virtually a travesty of the music. Such poorly sung performances just won't do."
1,Labored and joyless singing,"It is difficult to find another vocal album that is worse-sung than this one.The singing of Russell Watson is so labored and strident that I actually doesn't even feel comfortable listening to this album. In the lighter numbers, the performances by Watson lack any sense of joy. In fact, it almost amount to noise pollution all through!Russell Watson has been the subject of over-hyping. When one listens to his recordings without reference to all those exaggerated promotional slogans, one would immediately realise that his kind of voice and manner of singing are not even worthy for being recorded for posterity."
1,A disappointment,"I found this album to be very disappointing. After hearing all those hype about the singer featured here, I'd expect great singing. Unfortunately, the singer here is even less than decent. I can't understand why such an album can be released by such a respectable record company as Decca. What a shame!"
1,Embarrassing singing,The singing on this cd is very embarrassing. There're just too many defects here!I wonder how a record company can release such a substandand product in the market and ask for a full price!
1,Nothing seems to be right here,"Nothing seems to be right as regards the singing in this album. The notes are wrong, the style is inappropriate and the interpretation isn't true either.The performances here are just gross caricatures of the music. Just listen to other singers perform them, and you'll realise at once what sorts of things Russell Watson is missing."
3,Fun to listen to,"I wouldn't consider this one of the best albums released in 2004 nor one of the best metal albums. it is fun to listen to but the songs are a bit overused. i do like how they changed the styles in ""Forever"" and ""Elegy"" and I like the lyrics as well.Bu thtis c.d. didn't spend as much time as Demon Hunter's self-titled c.d. or Extol's ""Undecieved""."
5,Wow.,"I just got this cd, and after listening to 10 of the 12 songs, I am impressed. The lyrics are poetic, the vocals are haunting and show pain, the guitars are great, and the drummer...... wow, this cd is VERY good. I suggest you should buy it if you like gothenburg, grindcore or simular trpes of metal."
1,"Just 1 big headache, comparable to ""st anger""","wow, and i thought metallica's st anger sucked. This crap is all generic monotonous trendy scence crap. no talent whatsoever, not even a catchy lead or any variation. just the same 2 riffs over and over."
5,DAVID ALLISONS REVIEW,I love this band and the cd.I myself love bands that scream its like im addected to it but they half to be christen.This band remindes me of the band STILL REMAINS.My dads a paster and i com from a christen backround.But if your somewone like me you will love it.This band gives you the Heavey Metal feeling.Its great to get you pumped before an event.I HIGHLEY RECOMEND THIS BAND!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Sounds good at first, but it gets repetitive","Ok, basically stereotypical emo and metal somehow got fused together and made 'metalcore', but this band is one of the most emo bands I've ever listened to.I first saw this band on Headbanger's Ball, the single was 'Forever'. I thought it was pretty kickass and I went to research this band, I dug 94 hours. But then, after listening to other songs they had, it dawned on me how cliche'd, unoriginal, and repetitive this band is.Their lyrics are no more than a paragraph for each song and each one is about the singer crying about his girlfriend. Yeah, that's metal.The songs are just so god damned repetitive, Elegy and some other song (the name escapes me) have nearly identical intros!My advice is to enjoy their two singles and not buy the album, because you've heard everything they have to offer in those two songs."
1,F*cking christian rock,"another 11.99 down the tubes. musically the cd is cool, good guitar, good bass, good drums. but then i read the linear notes and found out these guys were screaming about how much they loved god. great, so you love god, thats not a good reason to be screaming about it. give me a break, and really if god's so great then how come you have to scream about a world that he/she created...think about it."
2,belhhhhhf,"Yeah, another generic metalcore band with the same old chugga chugga breakdowns. Not that i don't like those, but it just gets boring when AILD does it. Instrumentation? Not bad at all, but the vocals have to go. the best song in my opinion is ""Distance is Darkness"" It has more of a grind thing going on, as opposed to generic metalore sound. If AILD sounded like that in most songs, they'd be a lot more interesting. If you are a generic nu-metal or metal kid, listen to this band, they are more suitable for you."
3,Heavy but not high on musicianship,"I'll keep it short and to the point... This is heavy, not real high on musicianship, and kinda repetitive. Can't really listen to this this straight through - too many songs sound the same. I do think this will work well on the Ipod I use at the gym - songs are fast, heavy and aggresive. Just not something I'd listen to on the road or at the office."
5,Simply Amazing,"I am a huge fan of As I Lay Dying and this was the album that made me a fan, now while this band was a grower (I liked them for many years before having them truly reign as one of my 5 favorite metal bands). This is deffintley my favorite AILD album though, while the guitar work feels much more different then anything they will do after this album and most closely resembles their debut album, its easily my favorite. It has truly rememberable riffs, the drum work is great and so are the guitars, its a sad shame the guitarists from this album left the band, would have been nice to see what they would have done. With that said it fits in perfectly with their discography and is an amazing piece of music. FOR NEW FANS THIS IS THE ALBUM TO START WITH."
2,not to good...,"i was very dissapointed with this album. alot of the songs arn't really that good and theres only three okay ones. what a let down, not there best by far."
4,I never knew Christians could kick so much A$$!,"This is one brutal cd. Not many clean vocals through the CD, most of it is all screaming. 94 Hours has to be my favorite song, followed by Forever. But the songs do get repetitive after a while. Has some replay value, though the listener may get bored after a while. All in all this is a great band and in the boundaries of Christian music it's one of the best."
5,AMAZING,"so im sitting in my room listening to this cd about five minutes ago (ive already had it for like two weeks) just going through teh cd again, when i get to ""behind me lies another fallen soldier"". tracks like 94 hours and forever had amazed me but in my opinion, this was the song that blew me away.by the way, the singers scream is amazing. its one of those screams taht you can tell has been perfected, and it thouroughly conveys the singers feeling. some other bands i like try to scream but you can tell the screamer has problems with it (atreyu). THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE BANDS!!!! and as a drummer, i think its pretty safe to say the drumming is amazing :-D.go buy it!happy listening"
5,What the **** is wrong with you?,"I'm not really under 13. I'm just too lazy to make an account. Anyway, Pete says people should listen to bands like Dimmu Borgir. May I remind you that they came out with the album entitled ""Anal Sex on the Throne of King (something. Don't remember exact name).""I can't stand to hear people parading their favorite bands as good metal and then absolutely shun other good bands. Like I can parade that I love bands like Hatebreed, Bury Your Dead, and Slayer, and then turn right around and say I hate Pantera and Megadeth. As I Lay Dying is a very good band, and I think this album speaks for itself. Pick up this album on site. You won't be disappointed (unless you don't like this kind of music)."
5,Amazing,"This album is one of the best metal/hardcore albums ever. From beginning to end it is awesome. I know a lot of ""metalcore"" bands sound the same, but this cd stands out. Tim really has his vocals down. The energy that posses this band is pure and true. 94 Hours, Forever, and ever other track make this album listenable. I can listen to it over and over. Oh, by the way, this is a Christian band and I am not a Christian. They fool just about everybody."
5,"I don't give many 5 star reviews, but....","I have to make an exception for this album. Before their Metal Blade debut came out, I heard their first release, ""Beneath the Encasing of Ashes,"" and was impressed, but wasn't blown away. Then a few days later, I downloaded ""Distance Is Darkness,"" and was floored. The breakdown towards the end of the song, was easily the greatest and most emotional breakdown I had ever heard. Clean vocals aren't used often, but when they are, they add a wonderful touch to the music.Of the 12 songs on this album, they are all standouts. I have never heard a metal album this concistent. They go through many different genres of metal, (Gothenburg, metalcore) during the length of this album. If you like the melodic side of Unearth and Darkest Hour, you will love this. If you don't like metal, you will love this."
4,Joyous,"When I first had this album, I had listened to about 5 songs off of it. This completely blew me away. Fast, and hard drumming ( one of my favorite drummers ), great vocals, and amazing guitars. I highly recommend this album to anyone in love with metal. My favoriet tracks are ""Elegy"", ""Forever"", ""94 Hours"", and ""Song 10""."
4,"Good music, not-so-good variety","Many will hate me for this review. Trust me, I love this band with all my heart, and this CD is an excellent one. But you may just want to turn your 15 bucks in a different direction if you're looking for variety. If there was no pause between these songs, they could easily be one in the same. Some of the best double bass I have ever heard and one of the sexiest screams I know of ... on the plus side.I give this album 4 stars. Excellent, but not for variety."
1,Hate Metal? Love God? Buy this garbage!,This is embarrassing. Stop reading this review of an overhyped Styper knock-off band and go buy any and all Slayer albums. What's wrong with these guys? Trying to co-opt real emotional music to sell your religion is sad and transparent. Stick with the Osmonds and stay out of metal. I hate this band and if you like metal you will too. The one star given on this review has a circle around it. Instead of listening to this feeble attempt at metal you should shove pencils in your ears. Absolute trash.
1,"Lame, generic metalcore","AILD is a lame and generic metalcore band, and they suck! Although Jordan Mancinno is a good drummer, but Slipknot also has a good drummer but they also suck. All these guys do is bash their intruments and scream and whine about how much they love a guy who died 2005 years ago. I bet if all the ""breakdowns"" were taken away from this album, you'd be left with just another lame nu-metal album. Ultimately, this band is just as bad as any metalcore s*** act, not heavy at all!I bet if you metalcore loving, Hot Topic shopping poseurs listened to REAL metal bands like Mayhem, Emperor, Dimmu Borgir, Venom, Nile, Dying Fetus, F***...I'm Dead, Vital Remains, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Napalm Death, Carcass, Cryptopsy, Death, Kataklysm, Opeth, Pig Destroyer, etc. you'd all s*** your pants!!Death to nu-metal and metalcore!"
1,How can you enjoy this?,"As i lay dying is absolutely awful with their overall sound. There is no musical value to this at all. Uninspired yelling for vocals with a bit of a pathetic attempt at growling along side boring, repetitive monotonous guitar riffs played over and over. Though no worry. This album will be so kewl to show off to your new friends saying how hardcore you are. This album is all that really is. If you want something more musical i recommend avoiding this release. It's a constant headache throughout the entire album. Much better albums out there. Go look."
1,they suck,"I do not like AILD mainly because I need there to be some singing to like hardcore music. for hardcore I like Haste The Day, and Still Remains, and As Cities Burn. This is just a lack of variety. The guatar is cool and the drumbs but the vocalist needs to mix it up. It's too one dementional. Anybody who likes Death Metal with a screams and no singing would love this thou."
3,THAT was great.. Let me punch you.,"Well, its gotta be said, I love this. The vocals are brutal and by the most part so is everything else, from the double bass drums to the meteoric guitars, and while it is great to have such brutality and structure get your testosterone going, yet one complaint is that after the 3rd track you begin to sense a little dejavu as the rest of the songs seem a little to similar to the first 3. This unfortunately could have been an ep. ;("
5,Excelent Hardcore CD,"This cd is amazing. I love it, it's on e of the best cds in my collection. If you are a fan of hardcore music pick this cd up. I love hardcore music, and As I Lay Dying. So if your a fan of hardcore or just want some music to make you wanna kill someone get this cd. 'till next time, I hate you Sept. 22 reviewer from Freddy vs. Jason. Later"
2,darren,"as i lay dying are along the lines of your typical metalcore leanings with a hint of intesinsity and harmony amongest the chaos (ins songs like ""forever""). Sadly little of that holds up to much attention with choppy rythym shifts ans shapeless tunes. The album clocks in at under 38 minutes so theres little time for song structure development (most of them are over before they catch fire). Sadly while As i Lay Dying show distinguishing elements they lack solely in structure and shape. A semi promising mess"
4,very good cd,This cd is a very good cd but i think some of the songs sound the same. There isnt enough singing because they have really good singing when they do it. Well i like number 3.brandon
5,awesome,"First off, no i am not under 13, but all i want to do is say how awesome this band REALLY is. Every song on this album is creative, heavy and is full of crushing breakdowns. They kinda have a gothenberg style of riffs, but a hardcore voice. Not every song on this album is good, but all the others boost up the stars. My fave songs are 94 hours, Forever, Distance is darkness, behind me lies another fallen soldier and elegy. Other great hardcore/metalcore bands are Love is red, a thousand falling skies, bury your dead, acacia strain and still remains."
4,Awesome CD,"Slayer dude is way off! This band is as good as this genre gets. It's brutal and technical. I like it much better than their first cd, but even that one is good. Thank God there are so many bands to choose from, but AILD is a keeper in my book!"
4,Good and alot better than Bleeding through,"Now I'm really not the type of person who enjoys screamo metal but, very rarely there are a few bands that catch my attention.Bands like Avenged Sevenfold and Thrice are great and As I Lay Dying are spectacular. Great catchy crunchy riffs along with the brutality of the drummers double bass assault make ""Frail Words Collapse"" a good album. The songer could use a little work although he isn't bad he needs to sing a little more.I really enjoy the fact that they can make love songs like ""Forever"" and not make them sound lame. Who the hell said every metal song had to be about death and destruction anyway. ""distancte is Darkness"" is also a kick ass track with some of the oddest and inventive drum time signatures I've heard since the first Mudvayne album. Good album worth the money"
4,awsome,"for all the hardcore fans out there, this is the cd for you. they have awsome drum beats, catchy tunes, great vocals, and awsome guitar work. Even if you don't like hardcore, you'll like this cd. If you're one of those slipknot fags, you'll probaly even like this. It perfectly combindes a good blend of hardcore and metal, to bring you an awsome cd. The best song in my opinion is ""forever""."
5,GREAT CD!,I picked up this cd after seeing a video for the first track 94 hours. I dont normally buy a cd without listening to it first but it was a last minute decision and ive never regreted it. If you ever see this cd buy it dont think twice just buy it it is a perfect blend of metal and hardcore and speed metal(i know alot of people dont like speed metal but its only the drums thats speed metal and it sounds great) just buy this cd simple as that.
3,Not bad but could be improved.,"First, it works fine and the remote is a nice feature when going to bed. The light does not slide on the tent wall, though it is a bit heavy, caused by the 6 AA batteries. It could be brighter too. The flat reflective surface is white with no focal point. It uses an incandescent bulb which drains the batteries much faster than a florescent, or the new bright LED lamps. But it works well as a momentary light used to keep you from falling over your gear when going to bed. But if you're looking for a good reading light, you'd be better off with a battery powered clip-on book light. - HRB"
2,remote doesn't work well - poor quality product.,"poor design. comes apart easily and batteries won't stay in. remote works one-third of the time at best. these are used as a part of my home security system. I have about 20 of them, and i wish i had my money back instead of these. not good quality. i don't recommend."
4,a good shield,I bought this to replace an AVS one that had.. melted. At least that's what it looked like. It had deformed so much it was resting on the hood and scraping it up. This shield is the exact same shape and has the same attachments so they may be made by the same company. There is about 2 inches or more between the hood and the shield now and even at freeway speeds the shield doesn't hit the hood. I did not put the little bumpers on that came with the shield. Overall I'm happy with it but it is expensive. You can find cheaper ones.
1,Wrong Instructions.,Wrong instructions included for me as well. There's no manufacturer's website. There're no blueprints available online. I have a very disappointed little boy.
1,I can't believe I used to LIKE this JUNK!,"I used to love this as a baby, so I bought this for my sister's second birthday. She loved it, but I almost puked!!!!!!! The voices are so bland and dull, and the episodes went by very s_l_o_w. And WHY would you name a BOY teddy bear MORGAN?! That's a GIRL name! If I hear my sister sing that ""Rat-In-The-Hat"" song one more time, I'LL SCREAM!!!!!!! If you have kids, I'd rather you recommend ""The New Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh"" movies."
3,"Great songs, so-so sound","this has a great song collection, but a so-so sound. probably due to the fact that it is a cd from the 80's, prior to super remasters that are around. But the song collection makes up for it."
1,Careful with this one....,"I have been extremely dissapointed with this Unit. I bought it for Christmas to use in our trailer, unboxed it and played the first DVD - everything worked fine so I put it back in the box. Middle of March took it out of the box in preparation for our first trip out in the trailer and it wouldn't play a DVD. I tried the disc cleaners, etc, nothing worked. I called Magnavox and they told me it only has a 90 day warranty on labor. I got 2 estimates to have the DVD fixed - over $100.00 for a TV/DVD that was used 1 time. It now is a 13"" TV - won't play DVD's, CD's at all. I would not purchase this unit again."
1,Don't Buy This One!!!!!,"We have used this DVD player maybe 6 times. It no longer plays DVDs at all - it keeps displaying ""DISC ERROR."" Like another reviewer, mine will play audio CDs. I did call Customer Service and once they found out it was out of warranty they would not talk to me unless I paid $15 - which of course I did not do. Based on other reviews, I would say Magnavox is incapable of making a DVD player that can last longer than a couple of months. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE UNLESS YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE $200 TO THE MAGNAVOX R&D DEPARTMENT TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE A FUNCTIONING DVD PLAYER."
1,Don't buy this tv/dvd!!,"I bought this tv/dvd in August 2003 and never really could get the dvd player to work. I called Magnavox on December and the 90 day warranty was out so they would only pay for the part not labor to fix it. They sent 2 replacement parts which were both defective (and took 2 1/2 months to do), then placed all of those parts on hold while they looked into it for 2 months. Then the sent another part and said they check it and it worked. It was also defective! Magnavox has not been helpful at all!!! After 3 parts and 5 1/2 months of it being in the shop, they are going to take over 2 weeks to DECIDE if I can get a replacement tv...which I don't want...and they won't refund my money! I am now dealing with the store I bought it from to try to get my money back. If that doesn't work, my attorney said to take them to small claims court! What an ordeal for a $190 tv!!!! Never again will I own a Magnavox or Philips product!"
1,"Magnavox 13"" TV-DVD Combo.","One of the biggest mistakes I've made in an on-line purchase.I actually bought this tv for a my grand-children. I didn't attempt to use it for a long time. The dvd player is no good. it works for about 20 minuets and that's it. I waited too long to return it, so it's my loss."
3,LOSE YOURSELF,"LOSE YOURSELF IS ONE OF THE BEST SINGLES BY EMINEM!THIS CD HAs the VIDEO FOR ""LOSE YOURSELF""IT SUCKS BEACAUSE ITS ONLY A 3 SONG SINGLE. IT ALSO HASMUSIC VIDEOS AND TRAILER FOR EMINEM'S ""8 MILE"" MOVIE.COOL ""INSTRUMENTAL$Q VERSION.BUT I WOULDN'T 12.95 FOR IT.IT IS ONLY AN {IMPORT}CD-SINGLE.WITH AN VIDEO WELL YOU COULD ALMOST BUYTHE ""EIGHT MILE SOUND TRACK"" WITH THAT MONEYTHAT HAS EMINEM,50 CENT,EMINEM'S D12,OBIE TRICE.AND HAS THIS SELF-TITLED SINGLE ""LOSE YOURSELF""CUZ I HAVE THE ""8 MILE SOUND TRACK$Q1.LOSE YOURSELF 5/5{ALSO ON THE ""8 MILE SOUND TRACK"" THIS SONG IS REALLY AWESOME}2.LOSE YOURSELF {INSTRUMENTAL VERSION} 3/5{NOT ON ANY OTHER ALBUM BUT THIS ONE.ITS SO COOL }3.RENEGADE {JAY-Z FEATURING EMINEM} 5/5{FROM JAY-Z'S ""BLUEPRINT"" ALBUM, GREAT SONG}4.LOSE YOURSELF {THE VIDEO} 5/5{AWESOME VIDEO/COOL SONG}5.8 MILE MOVIE TRAILER 4/5{THE CLIP FROM EMINEM'S ""8 MILE"" I AM ONLY GIVING IT A 4/5CUZ IT'S ONLY A CLIP}OVERALL 5/5!"
5,A comfortable shoe...,"This shoe is very comfortable. The only thing you might want to consider is that as this is a remake of a ""vintage"" style, the sizes tend to run a little smaller compared to a more modern shoe, IMO. I typically wear a 9 or 9.5 in a ""new"" shoe, but in the older adidas ""originals"" styles, I buy a 10."
1,Needs updated configuration to work,"The program was made in 2002 and will not run on either my Mac (Mac OS 10.4.7) or my PC (Windows Vista home premium). It requires either a PowerPC Mac or a Windows operating system from the early 2000s (or earlier). It states that it needs NetScape 4.78 to run. Really, NetScape 4.78???? This might be a useful item if it could be reformatted and packaged to run on modern computer equipment."
1,Terrible,"This product advertices a 660 feet string and what I got is a 40 feet string and even the photo that they show of the product is diferent than what I got so I feel Tricked, very very bad reviews from me."
3,Poor Fit into a Pyle radio,"Purchased with a Pyle receiver and marine radio shield. This antenna fits very loosely into the Pyle brand radio. The ""plug"" metal is very thin and flexible.Long term I'm worried about it vibrating loose.Other than that it seems to work OK for my needs. I have not had a chance to test it ""in the city"" where I can actually pick up channels better."
1,What a nightmare,"While the talent of Claudio does not have equals; however, the product per se is something worse than a nightmare. I have ordered the 3-disc Tutti Qui and what I got was a duplicate Disc # 2, while Disc # 3 was MIA. Amazon was exceptional in replacing the 'defective' package with another, but with the same results. It is unbelievable!!!!"
1,Very Low Quality,"I usually keep a bunch of books handy on my desk. Instead of stacking them on top of each other (which makes accessing the ones in the bottom difficult), I was looking for a book tray. (Book holders won't work!) I found this product and in spite of its high price, I ordered it. It holds the books, but it is made of very low quality material. The picture shown is misleading. It might scratch your desk if you are not careful! I am returning the item."
2,Picture Something,The size was not correct and not was what I was expecting. Good quality print. Shipping charges were too high.
2,Mainly WW2 service camp shows-very 'same-y',"I own this, though through a different source. Many of the shows are cut in half, but this is never mentioned. ALL KoMK shows were ALWAYS 1 hr in length. This also mainly consists of camp shows, and most of the songs performed are then current hits of the day-very few Kyser Klassics. Finally, Phil Harris subs for Kyser on several shows, and though I like him, he's miscast here. The good part is there is still Ish Kabibble, Harry Babbitt, Sully Mason and the rest, so all is not lost. May be good for the completist."
3,Why oh why,I love books with strong women but I can't understand why these authors make strong women act/behave combatively. Annis would have been fine just being a strong business woman rather than behaving childishly. I still enjoyed the the book though.
2,Meh. What can you expect from a book that has a cover designed to make you dizzy?,"""Putting Your Passion into Print"" isn't a bad book, it just could have been done much better, or at least they could have spent more time on substance and less time on making it bright, flashy, and distracting. Fortunately, others have done this genre better, so a revision might not be in order. Specifically, the text wanders from topic to topic, offering disconnected tidbits as ""rules"" for getting yourself published. If you are looking for a book of lists of things to do, this book is stuffed with lists and should cater to most of your insecurities. But, if you are looking for a thoughtful reflection on how to design a proposal that fits your book, consider Richard Curtis's ""How to Be your Own Literary Agent"" or Eric Maisel's ""The Art of the Book Proposal."""
1,Slow delivery and food stained,"This book was a gift for my mother who is publishing her first book. Not only did it take over two weeks to receive, but it had a food stain on the first page. I didnt think to look through the book as it was nicely packaged in plastic with a sticker - appearing to be new. Now that I think about it, it was probably done to mask the stain. I am very disappointed and wont buy from this seller again."
4,XtraDrive,"A very compact device, this drive holds your SD card, allowing for easy USB connection.I have been using it for about one month with no problems. This unit is not quite as easy to use as a Thumb drive, as you have to open it first, to insert the disk. Exposed contacts inside suggest that they are to be handled with care."
3,fear of flying,"I did find this book gave alot of good information dispelling some fears I have about the safety of flying in an airplane. I found it a little sore on the eyes though, due to its unusual print."
5,Buyer Beware !,"Buyer beware ! The import Byrds boxed set (2011 edition) listed in conjunction with the U.S. version does not contain the bonus DVD, just the 4CD's. You wouldn't know it by looking at all the reviews. The music, to the best of my knowledge, is all the same. The reviews from the 2007 version (actually a tall boxed set) were carried over to the 2011 version which is shorter and more like a book with CD's."
3,"Byrds Box without ""Hey Joe""?","I will buy this box for the DVD. However, a Byrds set without their version of ""Hey Joe"" is not a comprehensive overview. Great band. I only wish they would release a box containing everything they recorded. I guess its like the Lucus Star Wars releases. A couple of years from now we'll see a larger Byrds box with everything included. A real pain for fans of the group."
3,"Long on Characters, Short on Suspense","Having read all of Kelly's books except this one, I made a special effort to find ""Keeper of the Mill."" I had enjoyed the other books...they had good, multi-layered characters and an a colorful environment. But, alas, this book was a disappointment. There were far too many characters for a short novel, and they were largely long dead, even though they were an intrinsic part of the plot. The main character, Claire, was less well developed, too....and I was quite glad when the plot was over. The book seemed longer than its 276 pages."
5,I NEVER SANG FOR MY FATHER,"The play booklet was just the right size for me to carry as I travelled. In the early stage of rehearsals, I was able to carry it on stage"
3,Jergen's Lotion,Did not receive items as promised. Had to e-mail several times before I received a response. Vendor has no number to contact only e-mail. Once received product was waht I wanted.
4,Why don't Christians take up this topic more often,"I enjoyed the authors perspective on the judgement day. This is not a new idea for me but I believe that this idea needs to be lifted forth in the Christian society. Christianity today has followed and fallen into the same problems it warned for. God has become more of a friend up there than a righteous and holy God who does demand justice. I feel that the author did present most of his ideas with arguments supported by the bible and early Christian teachers, with a few exceptions. These exceptions are presented as certain truths but were not taught nor even recognized by Christianity until the late 1800's. As you will see the arguments are also missing there. As a whole the book is well worth reading and I encourage the reader to test the authors understanding. Just as scripture asks us all to test everything, throw out the bad and keep the good."
4,Finally!,"Finally! This work is long overdue! People are so set in so called ""Christian orthodoxy"" that they are failing to see the message of Jesus as plainly put forth in the Bible. I have to wonder how those, like Mr. Youngkin and others, have missed these teachings, calling them a ""major doctrinal flaw"" in Brevere's book. Really? Christs own teachings are doctrinally flawed? I urge those who have fallen into the trap of believing everything that they are taught to read the Bible with new eyes and take it for what it actually says. Who wrote Christian orthodoxy anyway? Men did. Study the history."
5,Driven by Eternity,"Awesome, life changing!Driven by Eternity: Making Your Life Count Today & Forever"
5,Excellent Book!,"This book is,of course, just like all of the John Bevere books- hitting the spiritual nail right on the head. John is a very blessed writer and speaker conveying the spiritual truths that we need to hear today. I highly recommend this book for everybody!"
5,One of the most profound books,Wow this book had a profound influence on my life. I am now in the process of rereading it with a friend. It changed the way i think and act. To God be the glory!!
5,Could Not Put it Down,"I have been a Christian for almost 20 years and the truths found in this book are some that I have never been exposed to before this. The author pulls no punches as he lays out Biblical truths pertaining to salvation and the fact that so many of us have been deceived by the false prophets that abound in our times.The book's revelations are shocking but are exactly what our sin-filled, materialistc society needs. It is better to know the truth now than when we stand at the Judgement Seat of Christ.I am buying this book for seven people in my life - it was that good."
2,Driven By Eternity,"A very slow start...I love reading books..I buy lots of them, but this one kept me looking for something ""more""? Overall, I understood the intent of the book, I just, in the end, put it down. If someone wants this book, free, let me know and I'll ship it out to you. Send me an email. viviennempina at sbcglobal dot net.Vivienne Pina"
5,My Review,"Riveting Truth! This book will challenge you like never before, you will not be able to remain the same, how you respond is up to you! "" I place before you today life and death, therefore choose life"""
1,Bevere negates the grace of God and creates a doctrine of salvation through works,"Bevere's handling of the scriptures is negligent. He is not rightly dividing the word of truth as Paul admonishes Timothy in the 2nd book of Timothy. Bevere is adding a doctrine of works to a Christian's salvation which is heresy. A Christian's salvation is by faith in Christ alone. When a Christian stands before the judgment seat of God, his or her only defense is Christ, not works. A true Christian will bear fruit and work for the Lord out of their love and relationship with their risen savior. A true Christian can't help but want to be involved in the Lord's work. Trying to motivate people through the use of fear is pointless and it doesn't help them to have a healthy relationship with their Lord and Savior. Instruction is necessary for the Christian but heresy such as is written in John Bevere's book will only lead some astray. (read 2 Timothy 3:6 & 7)"
3,Quality Reading for the Mature Christian,"This book had good principles for the Christian life; however, there were some controversial topics addressed that a new believer may have a hard time understanding. Overall, it was a good read and I learned a lot."
5,A wake up call to those who are concerned with their eternity,This book totally transformed the way I look at my daily life. It challenged me to measure the things I do next to how I want to spend eternity. If you are up for the challenge of changing the way you live your life I encourage you to read this book. If I had the money I would buy everyone I know a copy.
5,Driven by Eternity by John Bevere,This book is by far one of the best books on the market regarding our destiny. It will change your life as a believer.
5,Living A Significant Life,"In Driven By Eternity, John Bevere focuses our attention not on the temporary things of this life, but redirects our gaze to the eternal. This book really grabbed my heart and led me on a personal quest to evaluate my own motivations for the daily tasks I do. I will admit that in many areas of my life I had begun to live the self-centered life, but through Driven By Eternity God has shown me how to live a fulfilled life through an eternal Christ centered mindset. Bevere's allegory in Driven By Eternity further illustrates the truth of eternity in a powerful, entertaining, thought provoking way. I highly recommend this book if you are tired of the mundane day to day existence and you want to live a life of significance!"
5,Cool!,"When I first opened this book I had no clue the boy called slow was Sitting Bull. When I realized that after reading a few pages, I thought wow! That is so neat. I learned so much about the indian culture and how they came up with their names. I like this book a lot. I'm going to keep it for my children to read when I get older."
4,great book to use in class,this is a great book to use in class for a biography lesson on sitting bull. it's also a great way to explore american indian naming practices.
3,Burlington Public Library Youth Book Discussion Group,"We read this book for our book club, and rated it on the following items. What is shown is an average of our votes, 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest:Illustration quality -- 4Information quality -- 3Information quantity -- 2Story quality -- 4We decided that if we were going to write a paper or take a test having only read this book, we would not do very well, hence the low number to information quantity. Our favorite part was when Slow defeated the other tribe and earned his new name, Sitting Bull."
5,Pleased,"Once I got the order in correctly and followed the directions, the book was delivered on time. It was a used book and I thought it was rather expensive for a used book. But it is the life of my grandfather and I had to have it. I have told other family members about it in case they want the last one.This was the first time I ordered from Amazon.com and I am pleased with the response.This was an Amazon Certified Purchase."
3,A mixed bag.,"Like most CDs, this one has a lot of filler to go along with a few good tracks. If you're considering buying it, the decision is really simple: Is the price of the CD worth it to you in order to hear Karen's marvelous voice on a few good arrangements (""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", ""The Christmas Song"", ""Merry Christmas, Darling"", maybe one or two others) -- even if the rest of the CD is uninspired at best, and some tracks are even embarrassingly bad? For me the answer was yes. But if you want every track to be a winner, you'll probably be disappointed."
2,Christmas Portrait Carpenders,"Not only was the product shipped to the wrong address, the charge for the purchase was my paypal account, that for some reason charged to an expired credit card that was for some reason still in the system. I have been contacted by a collection agency to collect the $14 for the product plus a $45 returned payment fee!!! Ouch!!! You guys are really slipping."
1,I do not like it,"I do not like the CD. Also, it took a big longer to receive my product in the mail. It is orchestrated and is not the commercial sound of the Carpenter's I am used to hearing at Christmas time."
5,Carpenters Christmas Portrait,"This entire CD is a class act. Never have I listened to more variety of styles, wonderful arrangements, and large number of Christmas favorites. It is a fitting tribute to the memory of Karen Carpenter and to the musical creative genius of her brother Richard."
5,Carpenters at their Best,"If you like the Carpenters music and that wonderful, gifted voice of Karen Carpenter, you are simply going to love this Christmas Music CD. The music arrangements and vocals are fantastic! What else would you expect from the Carpenters?I liked the music so much, especially Karen's vocals, that I listened to the CD throughout the month of January and loved every minute of it. Buy Christmas Portrait and enjoy. You'll be glad you did."
5,best christmas album ever!,the only reason to buy another christmas album is because you already have this one. if you don't have it yet...get it!
5,The quintessential Christmas CD !,"I'll admit I love Christmas music, and have around 150 Christmas cd's. Although there are many special ones, this is the absolute best all-around Christmas cd ever made. It has a wonderful mix of secular and religious, contemporary and traditional songs that make this a classic. I never get tired of hearing Karen's voice and Richard's arrangements. This is a must have that will immediately put you in the Christmas spirit!"
3,Carpenters Christmas CD,"A good holiday CD, had all types of Christmas songs, hymns, pop, instrumental. Great for the season."
5,Not just for baby boomers!!,"There is never a Christmas that we do not get out this set. Karen Carpenter's voice is so clear and beautiful, it was meant to sing the songs of Christmas. For those of us who remember the Carpenters, it is also a lovely trip down memory lane. If The Carpenters are before your time, try this wonderful music to see what you missed. You will not be sorry. The music stays in your head all through the holidays and makes them that much brighter. I thank the people who took the time to compile this set!"
3,Not what I expected.,"As great as the Carpenters are, this was not one of their best. I wanted Karen's vocals and Richard's music. But I guess I didn't read the description closely enough to know it wasn't all Carpenters."
2,BUY THE 2 CD CHRISTMAS COLLECTION - NOT THIS,"As many others who know and care have pointed out, this CD is NOT the original ""Christmas Portrait"" we were blessed with back in 1978.This CD was compiled by Richard Carpenter in 1984/85 after the release of ""An Old Fashioned Christmas"" (the 2nd Carpenters Christmas album).At the time, CD's were a brand new novelty, and Richard compiled this from both albums for the new format. I never liked all of his selections, as this one starts with the over-long overture from the 2nd album, and omits some key songs with vocals by Karen.Richard and A&M; Records recently released the original 1978 album, along with the 2nd one from 1984 on the 2-CD ""Christmas Collection"" for the many fans who had been requesting it all along. This ""special edition"" CD should have been deleted years ago, but it shows up every year. A much better single-disc compilation with all of Karen's vocals could easily be created to replace it."
5,It's about time I got it...,"I was but a child of eight when Karen left us. Now, decades later, I've yet to hear anyone whose voice can carry such joy or let you feel the pain that the music only can help push the feelings to you. Having grown up hearing these songs here and there (and not all of them, sadly) on the radio or in the stores around Christmas, it's time I actually go out and snag a copy of my own. Karen's untimely passing left everyone - young and old - with a feeling of emptiness that could only have been filled by the songs that she'd not yet sung, but she left behind the music she had recorded. Thank you, Karen, for sharing your gift with the world. Were you still with us, I've no doubt in my mind that you would still be singing new music that tugs at our souls and filling our hearts with feelings we didn't even know we had."
5,Christmas without The Carpenters? Never!,"This is one of the best and most-loved Christmas albums of all time, and it's definitely my favorite. I'm sure you've heard enough praise from the other reviewers about it to know that it's essential. I, however, would like to see this album packaged in it's original form (not as a Special Edition), along with ""An Old-Fashioned Christmas,"" and sold as two seperate CD's. The ""Christmas Collection"" 2-CD set has both albums together, and that's fine. But as a collector, I'd just like to have copies of ""Christmas Portrait"" and ""An Old-Fashioned Christmas"" in their original form, on seperate CDs. I guess it's obvious that I'm a pretty obsessive Carpenters fan! : ) Well, thanks for listening to my silly gripe! Go ahead and buy the Special Edition!"
4,Be Patient,"It does take 10 minutes to get to Karen's singing but the fill-in is good. All in all, the wait is wort it."
5,GREAT,I love this CD..My original one got cracked when I moved and was so happy to find another one. Recommend this one.
5,Brings Back Memories,"I have owned a vinyl copy of this album, a cd, and now the mp3 that can play anywhere. This album brings back memories of my teen years, and lots of really wonderful Christmas memories. Listening to Karen Carpenter's voice makes me a little sad that she's no longer with us to make beautiful music. Richard's arrangments gave traditional Christmas standards a contemporary (for the time, 1970's) sound. That's what makes this a nostalgic purchase for me. Always want this one in my holiday play list."
2,Not like the original,"I just bought this album to replace the original I had. I am unhappy with it because it is all chopped up. Most of the first tracks are not the Carpenters but medleys from some unkown orchraster. The album just is a mish mash of bits and pieces with some Carpenter originals thrown in to get you to buy it. You are not getting what the cover picture suggests, the original Carpenter's Christmas Portrait."
5,This CD is STILL essential!,"Even though the Carpenters' CHRISTMAS COLLECTION is now available, CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT (Special Edition) is STILL an holiday music essential. This version contains most of both, but not all of either, Carpenters' Christmas albums. One of the reasons it's a great thing to have--in addition to the CHRISTMAS COLLECTION--is the fact that so much from both albums is all contained on one CD. That makes it perfect for a single CD player, such as in a car or a portable stereo, where space is limited. The warm readings of so many different songs and carols glow on this recording. However, to keep from repeating myself, refer to the CHRISTMAS COLLECTION review for specific musical examples. Before you, the reader, jumps to any conclusions about the quality of this album, just know that I own both CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT (Special Edition) and CHRISTMAS COLLECTION. That's how important I think these recordings are. Enough said..."
5,THE BEST CHRISTMAS ALBUM OF ALL TIME,"Bing Crosby,Nat King Cole,Temptations,Jim Reeves,Jackson 5...These are great artist who have made the greatest Christmas albums....but Nobody I mean NOBODY comes close to The Carpenters...Each and every song on this album is amazing..My favorite track on this album is Christmas Waltz...Karen's Voice is just amazing on this...Merry Christmas Darling is a classic that no one can touch...It is not Christmas until I hear this album...This is the only Christmas album I can listen to in the summer time haha.............The Carpenters Rock!"
5,"Good, extensive knowledges in cardiovascular diseases","Good, extensive knowledges in cardiovascular diseases suitable for cardiologists, internists, cardiology fellows, residents and all physicians"
4,Everything OK!,Everything was good. The product arrived a little later then I was expected but they sent me a message to advise that.
1,non-functional out of the box,"purchased via the warehouse seller; although the lantern appeared in new condition and was unused, it didn't work - using the included mantle and new kerosene, the lantern would not provide a sustained light even after mantle burn-in, pressurization and proper priming - it appeared to be either a defective generator or a faulty design, as after a minute of nice light, the mantle would burst into an orange fireball; this happened no matter what pressure or valve setting, the result would be the same! i was really disappointed and returned the lantern - although amazon refunded the cost, i ended up out of pocket for the shipping cost - not really happy, as this was the first item i've ever returned to amazon... i have used other kerosene appliances and lanterns with no problem - i hope this isn't an indication of latter-day Coleman QC and manufacturing!"
3,Your better off,"your better off buying a dual fuel or a propane lantern than a kerosene lantern. I only bought it because it was a single mantle lantern and singles are hard to find. Why burn two mantles when a single is almost as bright?It works as claimed, but don't expect a longer burn time because it is Kero instead of unleaded gas because the burn times are the same. And the extra pains you have to go through to light Kerosene is simply not worth it. Take my advise, buy a dual fuel coleman."
4,pleased,"Very happy with this set - it's not the top of the line quality, but it it looks good and you get a lot for the price."
3,Looks nice - but NOT machine washable,"I just bought this comforter, as might be expected with new bedding I washed it before using it. Although it claims to be machine washable, and I washed it according to the care tag(cold, tumble dry), the colors still ran!I called to return it but was told that since I washed it, it would be subject to a 20% restocking fee. Even though it obviously must have been defective, I still got nowhere with their customer ""service"" representative or her manager. They asserted that since it arrived (apparently) perfect and in my possession is now ruined, I therefore *must* have washed it incorrectly. Nice.BUYER BEWARE!"
4,nice set for the price,"This is my first time to purchase micro suede. It is very soft, pretty, and the color is exactly as shown. It is a lightweight comforter and in some spots a little lumpy, a little light on the stuffing, but not very noticeable. The underside is a solid sheet-like green material. The pillows are quality and look cute with the stripes. Overall, it is a really nice looking set and worth the price. It would work great with a contemporary asian-style bedroom."
4,King set,"Ok, so yeah, as others have said, it looks great and feels great. There is, however, one flaw in the set I received. On the back of one of the decorative pillows, there's a seam that was noticeably sewn incorrectly. It's not so noticeable to others from a distance, but it immediately caught my attention when I took it out of the bag. I generally return 60-80% of the things I purchase and didn't feel it was necessary to make a return...although, the idea of repackaging it, bringing it to the post office and paying for shipping, may have had something to do with it, lol.Other than that, it was a pretty good buy. All of my house guests love it. I even had one jump on the bed and make imaginary snow angels just to feel the softness...and she's 36 years old!"
2,Be Careful When You Wash...,I bought this a year ago. Initially it was great. I loved the colors and softness. After a while the underside of the comforter starts to pill. Also the thread anchors in the comforter start to tear and then when you wash it all the stuffing bunches up in a big ball and you can no longer use it. It was definitely not worth the price.
3,"Enjoyable, but predictable!","I remember seeing this on Lifetime maybe a year ago. Thought it'd be interesting on a network that is mostly for women. I thought it was enjoyable to watch, but hardly groundbreaking. Unfortunately I was able to predict almost everything within a half-hour. Still it was a nice television film that surprisingly got transferred to dvd. Personally I wouldn't buy it, even if the always entertaining, and quite hot, Natasha Hendridge is in it. Well worth a rental though IMO if you can't find it getting repeated on cable tv."
5,I love the smell of new books,Received my Back to the Bible book this afternoon. It was delivered as agreed in great condition. No scars or banged up corners. About the book. Woodrow Kroll does a great job in explaining our lost love for the Word of God. I remember reading this book about 10 years ago and gave it to my son but he couldn't find it. Love the fact that even though the book was out of print I could find it from one of the Amazon folks. Thank you. Love the smell of the ink and new book smell.
3,Runs on the small size,"Purchased this for my daughter's baptism dress for when she is 6 months old. The size runs quite small (neck and upper body) and I am unsure if she will fit in it when the time comes (she will be exactly 6 months old at the time, is 4 months now)-- but the return policy/fees is making me keep it for now(restocking fee and of course shipping fees). Quality is fine."
3,Shotgun Alley,"I didn't really like it. Easy read, but all the profanity was a waste...I guess I'll stick to Parker novels...."
4,Hardboiled Fiction,"If you like your heroes tough, your femme fatales flawed, and your bad guys really bad, then this book is for you. Klavan's 2nd Weiss/Bishop novel isn't quite as tightly written or plotted as the series debut was, but it's as good as modern noir fiction gets. This book is far superior to Stephen King's recent foray into the genre, and should be at the top of any Spillane, Hammett, or Ross MacDonad fan's list."
4,Refreshing new author,"Andrew Klavanm's new series (Weiss & Bishop novels)is a refredshing new series. They are easy reads and while the 2 protagonists are not the type ""you would take home to meet Mom"", they make for very enjoyable stories."
2,average at best,"I dig Older Santana stuff overall&this song along with the Bulk of His Last Two Albums in His Cross-Over Make-Over just is a dime a dozen.the only thing that saves this Song is Carlos's Guitar Wails.Michelle Branch is pretty weak overall.She is trying to hard to seem legit at working with Carlos.Collabs have done got way out of hand.bad enough Carlos with Rob Thomas but this is even worser.only Carlos&the Band add some life to it.the Lyrics barely are ""Sesame Street"" Worthy."
1,Hyped Out Song,"What is the big deal with this song? Just because Santana plays guitar on it doesn't make it good. I've heard this song on the radio, and it's just terrible! How this ever got on the radio is beyond me. It's nothing special. Michelle Branch helped sell this band out, and everybody's loving it? Well, I'm not! I wish someone could tell me why this song has so much appeal, and maybe I'll appreciate it when I'm Carlos' age."
4,Not too shabby,"As a big fan of Michelle Branch, I was very excited when this song came out. She is an outstanding singer, songwriter, and guitar player. Although I do not like this song as much as others on her CD, it was okay. My main problem with it was that I could not hear much of Santana's guitar playing behind her lyrics and the rest of the music, and that was disappointing. After all, it is his CD. If you are a really big fan of Santana, I wouldn't suggest this CD. This is definetly not his best song. His older CD, Supernatural, had more impressive guitar playing then this track. I felt that this song was more about Branch and her singing. Otherwise, I loved this song and enjoyed listening to it. I do recommend this CD, despite the fact the guitar isn't as audible as it should be. I would buy this single more for Branch's singing then Santana and his guitar, even if I wasn't a Branch fan. This was the only main flaw I could find in this song."
5,"a little bit a branch, a little bit a santana= a song ya luv","great song, the collaboration brings wonderful energy. can't just listen to it once."
3,"Cute, but takes FOREVER to blow up","Very cute bed, my little one loves it, but.....it takes FOREVER to blow up! On here it says ""High-powered air pump for quick inflation and deflation""....yeah....right.... It's a manual foot pump that is a piece of junk and it took me about 30 minutes to blow everything up! Also, this bed does not come with the bedding, but it says on the box that you can buy it from Crown Crafts Infant Products.....wrong. I looked online and they don't carry any such thing. It's a good buy for a portable bed and your little one won't roll out, but buy an electric pump!"
4,Very Good Product...but a little work required!,"This is a great bed for Toddler's, whether used as a portable or permanent bed. We thought it would be a huge play time distraction and deter sleep, but not so! A couple of things to note: (1) watch out for the electric static, the interaction between sheets/pajamas may cause on the bed. You may want to use some type of static guard to reduce that effect (2) The air pump...which is actually a plastic foot pump was disappointing. The pump itself is not too durable and it takes awhile to inflate and deflate this bed. Overall though...definitely worth it!"
3,Elmo Bed- a bust,This bed is fun and cute but not durable and not a great buy. The pump that comes with the bed is worse than a bike pump and it takes FOREVER to blow it all up(4 separate things to blow up). My daughter liked being on an air bed and she had fun lounging in it but do not expect this to last very long at all.
2,Not a Great Investment!,"My son loves elmo, so when it was time to get him into a toddler bed, I found this and naturally thought, WOW he'll love it! Well to no surprise he did, but because of the looks of the bed, he believed it to be more of a play area rather then somewhere to sleep at night. And the bed does not hold up well at all! We have had it all off a few months, and it's already deflating. And he still falls asleep in my husbands recliner, and we then move him to his bed! Don't waste your money, rather get a regular toddler bed, so that the toddler knows it's not play time."
4,Good Read,"Good read - Not the best of the Compton books. However, I would recommend to the reader of western books."
3,This would include you.,"Do you know the personality of Eric Stonestreet? It's not too hard to miss it's the unique character of Modern Family. No, not the little Asian girl, the older but witty adult male that plays her father. I'm not too familiar with the gentle mans work but I'm sure the list of plays that he'd want to be in would include this one and the streetcar named desire."
1,Dvd drive stops working after a few weeks,"Purchased a MDV530VR for Christmas, the dvd stopped loading discs on 1/10/2004. Returned it on 1/11/2004 for a new one. The second unit stopped working on 1/29/2004. This time I'm exchanging it for another brand of dvd/vcr player."
1,no stars for this hunk of junk,thats right you too can have this lovely one of a kind piece of trash in your home for 2 easy payments. First one is 139.00 and the second is 99.00.(238.00) This should have gone from the box to the trash do not pass go do not pay 238. the dvd plays half way through then stops. Think the vcr slot is just big enough a stick of Dynamite....boom. dont buy dis.
1,The MDV530VR is not reliable,My MDV530VR quit playing commercial dvd's after 6 months. It can still play music dvd's or jpeg images created on a computer But it is now useless for playing dvd movies.The Magnavox website was useless to use and I didn't feel like staying on the phone after 20 minutes to try and talk to a real person. I went online and did a search for other comments on this unit. The other comments were not very encouraging. I decided that if you ever need service on the unit then you are screwed unless you have money to throw away.
1,Worst buy ever!,"Got this little fun box for Christmas.This DVD/VCR combo lasted all of 3 months and twenty days! DVD still working for now but the VCR is eating tapes like a fat man at a all you can eat buffet! Like everyone else, called customer service to see if what they wrote was correct, THEY ARE! The call was routed to India and since the 90 day warrenty was past I could get another one for ONLY $99.00! Yeah right, it'll be a cold day in H*LL before I buy another Magnavox product. However, this company has not heard the last of me! Let the complaints begin!"
1,Phillips/Magnovox - buyer beware,"I thought I was getting a quality product. Not only did I get a substandard product, but I also realized I bought it from a substandard company. I bought this unit in December and the DVD play quit after 110 days. Guess what, the warranty was for 90 days. Philips had nothing good to say other than send it in and I will be charged for a replacement unit which was darn near what I paid for this POS. No thanks, I will just chalk this up as a lesson learned and know better than to buy any more of their products."
1,Another lemon,"Sorry to sound like a broken record. We use the DVD player 3-4 times per month. Now the DVD player will not play ANY dvd's. The DVD player simply stopped working ...just in time for the holidays. You can be sure the next product won't be a Magnavox. No support and as of 12/27/04 only a ""coming soon"" page on www.magnavox.com. Very frustrating. Makes you stop and think that buying the $29 cheap DVDs may be a smarter way to go then spending extra on what you believe to be a quality product from a reputable company. Miffed in Minnesota."
1,Boycott Magnavox,"Totally agree with everyone else. We got this as a gift for christmas, played about 10 dvd's before the unit quit reading even brand new DVD's. Since it was over three months since the purchase date - magnavox tried to sell me a replacement piece of $h%t for $88. I'll never buy another Magnavox product in my life."
1,Piece of Junk,"After deciding to buy my first DVD player in 2003, I wanted to get one with a vcr with it. I owned a Magnavox vcr at the time and that one lasted me over 10 years so I figured the new one would serve me well too. Well BIG mistake, reading all these other reviews I see I was not the only one disappointed. Not even a year it would not play DVD's anymore. (And I only played maybe 20 dvd's in that year) Told me that playback feature is not available on that disc. EVERYONE OF THEM. Soon after that It started to eat my video tapes, recording them and playing them. Even after rewinding them it would come out chewed up. I will never buy a Magnavox again. I feel cheated out of $200, and wish I would of read these reviews before I bought this POS. I replaced that Magnavox with a generic less expensive player, and so far I'm happy with the results. I'm done with Magnavox."
1,Expensive Paperweight,"ZERO STARS - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have had many fine Magnavox products and this is not one. This was a birthday gift to our daughter. The unit worked fine for about six months - except the remote only works from about five feet away. I have not had any problems with the VCR but the DVD player comes back with a Disc Error even on new DVD's. Now I can only play VCR's but I already had a VCR player so what's the point. The warranty is useless., timed to expire right before the machine dies. A $130 lesson learned, review the product before your buy."
1,WORST PURCHASE I EVER MADE,This unit stopped working completely after 7 months. All I had used it for was to play DVDs. In total used less than 20 times for DVD only. The 1 year warranty was a lie. After 3 months you have to pay to replace it. They wanted $99.99 to replace a unit that has sold as low as $89.99 at the warehouse club. I wish I could rate this a zero. I don't give it any stars.I will never buy anything from Phillips Magnavox ever again.Total rip-off.
1,AVOID!!!!!,"I HATE this DVD player. After about four months it started freezing DVDs in the middle of playback, pixelating the screen, jumping around on the track, etc. It won't even load some of my DVDs (regional encoding is not the issue). For example, disc one of a set will play, but disc two will not. Go figure!I usually research all my electronics purchases, but got this one because I had a gift card at Target and I had faith in the Magnavox name. Forget it. Magnavox's reputation is shot with this piece of junk."
1,Do your research first!,"Magnavox DVD/VCR Player, DV200MW8About a week ago I purchased the above DVD/VCR, the second time I'd used it, it devoured one of my favorite tapes. To my dismay, I'd called the company to complain and hopefull get a replacement tape or CD, they refused and started passing the buck on the store, from which I'd purchased it. Well the store didn't manufacture the component.Talk about customer service satisfaction...Where is it? the company can forget about me buying another product of theirs."
1,WOW guess what.,"Purchased one year ago. I fell asleep during a movie last night, tried to watch it again today and it reports that it is not compatible with that region disk anymore. It was fine until now. Works with all other region 1 disks, just not the one I want to watch now. I hate it with all my heart."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Shame on me for not doing my homework first or at least reading these reviews prior to purchasing a machine. A short time after having this dual VCR/DVD we encountered problems. Of course it started after the huge 90-day warranty period. We encountered jammed/torn up tapes and new movies in the VCR slot, blinking errors and a load humming like that of a 747 jet. We tried getting it fixed three times from an independant store w/ no luck. Like they say you can't polish ______. Magnavox agreed to send us another DVD/VCR for $100. No thanks. Do not waste your $$, buy another brand - this one is a true junker. Try Sony or another reputable brand - I have had good luck w/ Panasonic."
1,JUNK!!!,Like all the rest I had my unit a few months and then it quit playing DVDs giving me error messages (sometimes different messages after attempting to play the same DVD). I too always thought Magnavox stood for quality. I will not buy Magnavox ever again! DO NOT BUY THIS PILE OF JUNK!!!
1,DVD failed in less than 6 months,"DVD Disc Error after less than 6 months; DVD player is now completely unusable. Remote control is very confusing and the unit, as a whole, seems to lack any coherent or logical flow. On the plus side it is cheap, but you get what you pay for."
1,Magnavox MDV530VR combo DVD/VCR,"DO NOT BUY THIS! I purchased this unit and was pleased for 3 and half months. The dvd unit ceased to work after just four months. Ironically, the full warranty is for 90 days only. I contacted Magnavox (Philips) customer service and they told me to eject the DVD and start again. Of course I had already done this and told them. They then said my unit was indeed malfunctioning and I could obtain a replacement unit for [full price]. ... If the replacement unit after just four months is priced as full price, it is obvious Magnavox/Philips expects it to last approx. four months. For this price, you'd be better off renting a unit!"
1,"DVD unit very suspect, caveat emptor!","I didn't get mine from Amazon, but from a brick and mortar Target. This is strictly a public service:Bought it around Thanksgiving, and before Christmas came, the DVD unit quit loading. I called Magnavox and after agreeing it was an obvious hardware failure they wanted to give me a shipping address where I could send it and get a replacement. Instead, I went back to the store and got them to give me a replacement unit.It's January 15 and guess what? Last night the DVD drive on the replacement failed just like the first one.For the record, I do not use the thing more than about three movies a week, so it's not like I'm demanding an industrial duty machine.I can not state it strongly enough: it is a piece of junk, I would never buy another and my former faith in the Magnavox brand is no more. An inexpensive machine isn't expensive when you have to return it twice for an exchange. The only reason this review has one star is Amazon does not offer a zero."
1,Beware after 3 months...,"This item works really well...for about three months right after the warranty runs out. My dvd player also ceased working about 31/2 to 4 months after I purchased it, and from what you all are saying, I'll have to purchase a new one at full price! Talk about horrible customer service! I will not be happy when I get the news from my e-mail I just wrote them. What a load of crap."
2,Lasted a year,"Magnavox used to be a name one associated with quality products, but my Magnavox DVD/VCR combo is only a year old and has stopped working. I bought it for the convenience of being able to play both videos and DVDs and was told the motor was quiet. From day one, I found the motor hum to be noticeable and it got worse from there. Now it won't record or play videos. I wish I had read the customer reviews before I bought it. I agree that it's a poor product."
1,PIECE OF $H!T,"I concur with everyone else on this board... My DVD hasn't gone out yet, but it sounds like it will. The VCR just crapped out though. I keep getting lots of errors and it keeps eating my tapes, and cleaning won't do the trick.Magnavox will send out a replacement when I send them my broken unit plus a check for $99. WHO THE HELL ARE THEY KIDDING?! I think we should all file a claim against them.....this is ridiculous."
1,Dvd player stopped working after 3 weeks.,"Purchased a MDV530VR for Christmas, the Dvd player stopped working on 1/10/2004. Returned it on 1/11/2004 for a new one. The dvd player on the second unit stopped working on 1/29/2004. This time I'm exchanging it for a different brand of dvd/vcr combo player."
1,Do Not BUY,"We purchased this unit new and six months later, the DVD Player simply stopped reading all disks. After contacting Magnavox, we were told that they would be happy to send us a used replacement unit for the ""discount"" price of $ 99 plus shipping.Magnavox does not stand behind their products and in fact try to further profit from defective products. This must be part of their business strategy to sell poorly made products and then sell them again under the guise of a ""discount"" warranty price.Companies should not be allowed to act this way and I would urge everyone to not buy products from Philips or Magnavox until they change this policy and stand behind their products."
3,Fun!,They are certainly fun to mess around with. Great for a bachelor party or for your own personal fun. Very realistic.
5,Fascinating and un-put-downable!,"I bought this book due to a farely recent, but obsessive, facsination with space travel. It answers every question I had ever thought of and more. It also made me think in a totally different way, and so I came up with a whole host of new questions. I feel this book has opened up a whole new part of brain that was previously closed off. Thankyou R M Mullane!!"
4,Interviews Add New Light on Several Topics,"Reading Camp's intervies makes you wish he had a chance to write the definitive book on Custer and the LBH. The accounts are a little rambling because they are based on Camp's original notes. The interviews highlight conflicts between some of the notable but challengable LBH testimonies. The interviews also reveal information about the retreat from Weir Point, the mystery rider in C Company found miles from the battlefield on the Rosebud, first hand accounts of the death of Crazy Horse, information on ""White hat"" (Lt. Phillo Clark) and a virtual biography on Luther North who demonstrated great success utilizing Pawnee tribesmen as soildiers and scouts. The footnotes provided by the editors provide a terrific resource of information that more than adds to the Camp's notes, almost like having two books in one."
1,A big ( ),"This has to be the worst book I have read so far on Custer andthe Little Big Horn Battle. Big print, wide margins make this book inmy mind a money grab. Thirty pages of preface and introduction and 11 blank pages help to fill out this book. This book does have some interesting points but all in all I found it very disapointing. They must have laughed they way to bank with this one. END"
1,UnSat.,"This sticker is cheap crap. Marines, do yourself a favor and spend 10 bucks for a nice one. Semper Fi."
5,OoRah USMC!,"I purchased the Marine Corp Globe & Anchor Decal from Rothco and I'm very satisfied! It remains firmly attached to the back window of my van and I ""Wear"" it proudly!"
5,Exciting and Great Fun!,"A high-school cheerleading advisor goes off the deep end and starts kidnapping cheerleaders, because of the emotional scars suffered back in the 1970s, when she was a high-school cheerleader herself. Is it farfetched? Absolutely! Does that matter? Not in the least. This is not a book meant to be taken too seriously. Kate William hits another one out of the park in this highly entertaining, slightly tongue-in-cheek suspense story. The 1970s touches -- smiley faces, Jefferson Airplane, beanbag chairs -- are loads of fun. And the Wakefield twins and their friends, as always, save the day in the end. Yeah, you knew they would. But that doesn't make the ride any less enjoyable."
5,A Lot Of Fun,"R For Revenge is a Sweet Valley High thriller that lives up to it's name. The story is fast paced and exciting.When Sweet Valley High decides that al student activites at school need chaperones, the cheerleaders are forced to find a new supervisor. But with Jessica and Heather, the cocaptains, fighting over a hunky photogrpaher helping to do a magazine story on their squad and cheerleaders going missing, they might all get more than they bargained for.Recommended for girls aged 12-15."
4,This was An AWESOME book!,This books was really good! It kept you interested and showed you what each character was thinkin'! It was AWESOME!
1,This book will cost you more than it's cover price.,"Are you looking for a sure way to get your internet account terminated and to be hated by countless others? This is the book for you! Martha Siegel herself invented SPAM along with fellow attorney and husband Larry Canter. Folks there are legitimate ways of making money without making enemies and this is NOT one of them. SPAM is SPAM and this is basically just a manual on how to do it. Save yourself the money and bad karma. Singularly probably the biggest piece of dribbling garbage ever printed by HarperCollins. In fact it's a shame that Amazon does not allow zero stars or even negative ones, this one would easily earn them."
1,Spam spam spam spam spam!,"Read this book if you want to learn how to be a totally unethical jerk who steals bandwidth, disk space, and other resources for your own benefit at the expense of all other Internet users.Martha Siegel and her (ex-?)husband Larry Canter invented the practice of spamming for profit. Please don't support them with book royalties."
1,The definitive guide to losing your Internet Account...,"The definitive guide to having your Internet Account terminated --- from the original masters of spam and slime.No self-respecting Internet businessman would be caught dead reading this book, let alone following its advice.Highly recommended...as cat box lining. ;)"
1,A really great way to LOSE money on the internet,"Laurence Canter is on the Blacklist of Internet Advertisers for a reason; his actions have been atrocious, and now he is trying to make money from the REAL suckers... people who buy this book. If you really want to learn about marketing, there are much better choices listed at Amazon. This book will teach you only to get your account revoked or sift through lots of flame mail, so any increase in genuine interest is not worth the added expense and frustration"
1,I wish there was a lower rating...,This is a terrible book that will do nothing other than make your target markets furious with you.Thank you.
1,Misleading and Inaccurate,"The advice that Siegel and Canter dispense in this book is worse than useless. It will almost certainly get your Internet account cancelled if you tried to follow their instructions. There is such a thing as legitimate methods of conducting business on the Internet. Business-2-business sites and e-commerce sites are good examples of this. But the ""send unsolicited bulk emails"" and ""spam thousands of Usenet newsgroups"" strategies that this book teaches are not only ineffective (it has been estimated that over 95% of spammers lose money in the long run), but unethical. UCE and spam take advantage of the Tragedy of the Commons: UCE and spam are not free-speech issues. Siegel and Canter should be ashamed."
4,"Factual, comrehensive, extremely easy to read.","This book is a gem. The topic used to be controversial, but it isn't any more. This book is a good guide to how to market on the internet. The relevant steps, techniques, and laws are all treated comprehensively, yet in lay language that is very welcome in comparison to normal internet prose. No competing book that I am aware of deals with all these matters, and few deal with even part of this material as well. An excellent how-to book that is not condescending."
4,A GREAT BOOK!,"I was delighted with this book and so will you be. You'll be making more money than you could ever imagine, quickly and easily."
5,"""Excellent"" is all I can say","I did not purchase this book, but got it from my local library and read it cover to cover. It stimulated my creative juices on figuring out different ways to make money with the internet. It also gave me thorough information on the various aspects of making money on the internet that I needed to know, from advertising on the net to various hardware options. I also very much appreciated the real life anecdotes given my Ms. Seigel, especially about mass e-mailing. I am recommending this book to a friend interested in making money on the net. I am here at amazon to find out the author's name. My recommendation--get this book."
3,"Major 80's tunes, to the Trance/House beat !","I bought this album in February 2003, and I was under the impression that this would be another stellar recording for the Clubber's Guide series. It's all right, I'll tell you that...if you enjoy 80's music, back in the 80's :) Otherwise, there are some new songs interspersed within this album like Divine Inspiration's ""The Way"" and DJ Sammy and Yanou's (featuring Do) ""Heaven"". If you enjoyed the Clubber's Guide series from 2001 and 2002, this one takes a retro-80's groove. This is almost like MOS's Annual 2003 from the UK (3xCD, 63 Tracks), versus the Australian version."
3,"Get the ""Oro Salsero 20 Exitos"" 2-CD set instead of this one (see below).","Although this compilation has 15 of Willie Rosario's big 1978-83 hits, all are (sadly) single edits as opposed to the LP versions. Willie Rosario and his band have been responsible for some of the funkiest, hard-hitting, heavy-swinging Puerto Rican Salsa tracks ever recorded but they need to be heard in their original full-length versions to be fully appreciated. The ""Oro Salsero 20 Exitos"" 2-CD set is a far better choice than this compilation."
4,Silly Swingers!,"In this novelty book, toddlers help various animals boogie by pulling tabs connected to strings of yarn on the animals' appendages. Hot-pink birds bounce, giraffes sway, zebra slides, camel swings and monkeys jam.The bobbing arms and legs truly impart a sense of movement, making the creatures look happy-kind of silly, too. That, plus the short, rhyming text and the wildly colorful pictures will put the youngest swingers in a party mood!"
3,projection clock,"I bought this clock/temperature/humidity instrument for the projection of the time on the ceiling. The problem is that I live in Hawaii and Oregon Instruments didn't include that time zone or Alaska in their selections. They do claim there is a way to shut off the atomic clock but it doesn't work as explained in the manual. They say that the clock resetting signal from Colorado Springs doesn't reach Hawaii or Alaska. I can't speak for Alaska but it causes the clock to reset at least every other day here so it is certainly reaching Hawaii. If you live on the mainland (lower 48) this may answer your needs, but if you are in Hawaii or Alaska I would definitely NOT purchase it. I have had previous projection clocks (which I didn't bring with me when I moved to Hawaii) which included both Alaska and Hawaii time zones. I think it is a great oversight on the part of Oregon Instruments to include only the mainland time zones in their clock."
1,A TEENAGER MOVIE,"IF YOU'RE A TEENAGER-YOU'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE.I'M AN ADULT-AND TO ME,THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE!ALL THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT IS KIDS IN HIGHSCHOOL WHO LIKE TO PARTY.THEY GO TO THIS ONE GIRLS HOUSE TO PARTY BECAUSE HER PARENTS ARE OUT OF TOWN FOR A WEEK.SO THE PARTYING BEGINS-BIG DEAL!20 MINUTES AT THE END OF THE MOVIE-A FEW MURDERS HAPPEN.FROM TIME TO TIME YOU'LL SEE A MAN WANDERING AROUND DIFFERENT PLACES.THERE IS A SURPRISE ENDING,THOUGH."
4,WOW!,Sweet insanity is one of the best horror films I've ever watched. SCARY! My girlfriend loved it too.
4,Don't Watch Alone!,Scary as hell! Horror the way it used to be! I watched SWEET with my man and I'm still having nightmares. And that lead is such a hottie!
1,Awful,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It had such cool cover art on the DVD that I took a chance and rented it - foolish move. It just isn't scary. It is a typical slasher type film, but with no scares, storyline, etc.. I watch many, many movies and can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the top 5 worst movies I've seen. I highly recommend staying clear of this movie."
1,THIS MOVIE BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!,"I love horror movies of all types, i decided to pick up this movie thinking hey i could at least get a good laugh but NO!!!! the cover has nothing to do with the film, it made no sense what so ever, the shooting of the film made it look like a cheap porno film without the porno!!!!. Filmed at home."
3,Not the original music from the production,"Okay CD but not the original music from the wonderful ""flight of the condor"" video years back. I should have known better."
4,Underrated Effort.,"Even though From The Underground was way better in my opinion, Necroshine isn't bad either. The songs are generally slower paced. It isn't as heavy either and an overall more polished and accessible sound. It will sound light compared to their last 2 efforts but it's still a metal album and it's far better than anything Metallica did from the mid '90s to the early '00s. It's not really thrash though, it's more groove metal with a hint of alternative rock. A very similar sound to Anthrax's ""Stomp 442"" and ""Vol 8"", if you enjoyed those albums than you'll probably like Necroshine."
2,necroshine is the only stand out track the rest is not thrash at all!,"this cd has overkill way out of it's eliment this cd dosn't thrash except the title track.this cd is more of a classic heavy metal album nothing more than good tunes maiden,priest,sabbath,dio and ozzy maybe.It sounds like D D listened to kiss to much and noone else had much to add musically.like they had to release something but had no tunes written just putting together anything they could."
2,necroshine is the only song worth buying this for classis overkill,this cd is a strange group of songs not you classic overkill at all.buy it for the title track it kills but the rest is trash
2,Not that Great,"Not the greatest Overkill CD. Songs lack depth, singing could use some work, and Joe Comeau just plainly [stinks]. Pick up Bloodletting or Horrorscope if you really want to get your head-banging."
1,overkill new cd,"this cd is not the best forks sorry, overkill has gone alternative man whats the deal here! like metallica and megadeth the days of thrash with these groups are over for good!!!"
2,One-dimensional decorating,"Not knowing this author, but trying to build a collection of Christmas ideas, I eagerly ordered this book. I now realize that there is a group of ""Mary"" fans for which this book is intended: those who know & love what this author produces. I think this because the book has received such glowing reviews here, but I found its ideas and techniques uninspiring, page after page.I did like looking at the cards created by the author. But I quickly became bored with the rest; it's all green+red+gold themes, the photos are fuzzy, and the ideas lack variety. So this ""Mary"" book will not become part of my library. I'm releasing it for someone else to enjoy.I have found more inventive holiday how-to books out there--such as the Southern Living series--Christmas with Southern Living 2006. Happy Holidays."
3,Mary Engelbreit's Christmas Companion,I was a bit disappointed with the illustrations. I thought there would be more about decorating for Christmas. The book wasn't what I thought it was going to be.
5,Literary Fiction at it's Best,"This is a truly inventive Novel- sentence after sentence arrested me with great combinations of language, character,memory and metaphor. I could list at least 500 sentences that knocked me out.The characters and plot kept me involved on a personal level (wondering where they were going to wind up) while enough quirky ""holes"" created through gaps in narrative and Kuper's mastery of metaphor created a point of view where i was able to watch the successive trainwrecks of the various lives pile up with a detached amusement.i really enjoyed reading this book."
1,What did I just read?!,"Very confusing book. With so many good books out there, I don't know why I wasted my time."
2,Not worth the inflated price,"Unless you're a rabid CoC collector who has to have this iconic campaign, don't get fooled into paying the ridiculous $100 asking price. It's an okay adventure to read, being a sort of sequel to the story its based on, but playing it is more trouble then its worth. Roughly the first seven chapters are just getting ready to leave to the arctic, getting threatening leaders, and a few attempts at sabotage that the PC's can't really prevent, and ultimately the writers of this adventure just tried way too hard to make the whole campaign as lethal as possible. If you're dead set on playing it go buy a PDF and, if you need something physical, print it out. You can even listen to the campaign on an audio game on the RPGMP3 podcast."
3,"Not A Bad Book, But Not Really Anything Special",Don't be mislead by the size of this monster. This book puts ALOT of detail into each chapter so it appears much bigger and longer than it actually is.It's not that bad but it's kind of simple but it is fun if you like a real straightforward kind of story. It's also got alot of great source information about Antarctica in the back.It's not a bad buy but it is pretty over priced for what it is. I felt jipped out of what I spent. I'd reccomend this book if you found it for cheap but don't waste money that you could spend on something better.
4,Good,"These pins are nice, very easy to grab, I do wish they were longer, but that was my mistake, overall a nice item"
5,wonderful product,"wow, i bought this small TV for my bedroom but at a very cheaper price from Ebay, from some guys from california plus shipping was free temporarly, and i loved it very much....very nice product for its price. it has a perfect picture and sound. i would really recommend this stylish TV for any one who wants to spend not much money and get a good product."
4,What a Deal!,"I have a small built-in office in my bedroom. I wanted a flat monitor for my pc and a small tv to watch. With space a premium, I didn't know what to get first. I saw this little jewel at Walmart for $288 and was almost afraid to try it. Only Walmart's return policy convinced me to try it. Boy, am I glad I did. I satisfied both of my objectives for less than any other HD ready LCD tv I have seen. Because of it however, I ended up spending more money. I used the extra space to hook up a Dishnetwork Model 811 HD receiver to the Component Video Input and now I have 760p tv in my office. Kids are extatic because I stay in my office and now they get more time on the big, heavy, expensive HDTV in my den. Next, I need about a 500 watt home theatre with optical audio hook-up. My only gripe, and it costs Philips/Magnavox one* is I did not get an Owner's Manual in English and communicating with their support is annoying."
1,Are You Kidding?,"I cannot understand the high ratings given by others unless they are planted reviews. This book is horrible. Poor technical accuracy, poor writing, poor English. I barely got thru 25 pages and could not go on.Be suspicious of books with under 100 reviews that are all 5 star, especially if they lack editorial reviews.Want a good book? Try ""Old Man's War""...."
1,CAN I GIVE LESS THAN 1 STAR?,"I am writing this so you dont spend any $ on this crapola. Beleive me when I say someone should pay you to read this. Seems like it was written because there would be a prize given to the author who used the most words no one ever really uses. I got through the first chapter and had to stop my self from screaming out loud. I wouldn't recommend this if you were standed on an ice cap and needed to start a fire with the pages. The people who rated this anything above 1 star should not be allowed to reproduce.OK...did I amke my point? Just in case I dint, let me say-This book %^$#@*!"
4,You can't put it down!,"Charlie Mann's thriller Polar Cap Five is a spectacular one. I love keeping my eyes open to read it all in one setting, the body just would not hold up. Can't wait for the next one."
5,The Gift-Acoustic Offerings is great listening all year around!,"This is one of my all time favorite holiday music collections. It is the most relaxing acoustic Christmas album I have ever enjoyed. It is very calming. I first purchased it over twenty years ago as a tape when my son was just a baby, and we used to fall asleep listening to it at nap time--and we even started listening to it all year around. I wore out the tape, and was so disappointed because I looked everywhere for it. I could not find it. Then, years later, I found the cd once again,here on Amazon, and even though I thought it a bit pricey at twenty-one dollars, I was so pleased that it was still available, I splurged and got the cd. It is uniquely beautiful in its clarity and simplicity with the piano, oboe, flute, and classical guitar. The arrangements are lovely and true to original form. It also makes a great Christmas present for friends who hear it at your house and say, ""Who is that? Where'd you get it?"""
5,seller's reveiw,"This CD is a beautiful, acoustic guitar collection of Holiday music, sure to set a glowing ambience for any Holiday occasion."
3,MP3,"It is a flick that takes you back to your school days. Back to the times when you had your first crush. However, you may not have pursued the girl you loved to the extent the young protagonist in Mera Pehla Pehla Pyar does - right to the Eiffel Tower in a Tom Cruise style.For teenagers, 'MP3' is a film they can directly relate to. For adults, it is a trip down the memory lane. And mind you, memory never fades when it comes to one's first love. You always remember it."
4,Great sound for a low price!,"My husband was pleasantly surprised at the good sound quality. They are so small & compact that they are great for travel/office/home or where ever! Considering that they do not have a subwoofer, they do a pretty good job! The box says the Power Adapter should be up to 350mA but I found that the 300mA Adapter works very well! The 350mA Adapter causes some buzzing noise because it is a little bit too high power."
1,EXTREME JUNK!,"Well I just recieved my $4.99 oiece of junk, and BOY... i never knew speakers could sound so bad! What I was sent was a cheap knockoff- not the right brand, had no AC cable, was flimsy, etc etc.... need I say more? Perhaps the product carried by reputable vendors would be different, but avoid this one like the plague."
3,Good for the price,"I bought these portable ipod speakers for $20 at Bed, Bath and Beyond about a year ago. I still have them and they still work. I use them soley for traveling. I plug them in at my hotel and listen to my ipod there. The sound quality is poor, but what do you expect at that price? They are fine for a little background music or to help you get to sleep. The handy part - the thing I love - is how they fold up so compactly and have a little carry case, too."
3,Cool little thingy,"Wouldnt use this as a primary docking station in the living room, but sounds great in the bathroom while I'm in the shower. Comes with ac adapter! My daughter loves it too."
1,"Wow this is bad, bad bad!","What ever you do, avoid this book like the plague. The characters are useless and unlikeable, the story boring and pointless and after you read this you wonder why you wasted time reading it! Your time would be better spent watching paint dry. I reccomend this to fans of the books Scrotie McBoogerballs or the Poop Who took a Pee."
3,Charlie Johnson in the Flames,"This story was a little disjointed, I felt. I never could develop a real feeling for the lead character, he always seemed to me to be a little unfocused on what he was doing, thus so did the story. Not the worst I've read, but not the best either."
1,CCDA written by Dummies,"This book is bad, and I don't mean in a good way. The book is missing a lot of details, and if you have any knowledge the mistakes will jump out at you. For example, on page 44 it gives the OSI model (from 1-7) as Physical, Data Link, Transport, Network, Session, Presentation, Application. Then, it says make sure you know the correct order for the test. Why? The authors don't. On another question, the book says you should answer, ""I don't know because you haven't taught me, yet."" Try answering a question on the CCDA exam, as I don't know it's beyond the scope of the test. Also, the editor must have just used the spell check and not actually read the book. There are a lot of errors like ""form"" for ""from"" and ""wit"" for ""with."" You can figure out what they are trying to say, but it is annoying and makes you lose your focus on studying. I do not recommend this book."
1,Not the latest version of the Cisco Test,I'm sure this was a pretty good book - but don't order it unless you want to study for the expired Cisco CCDA test. Their is some similarity but the tests are not the same!
5,Looks good...,"This book seems, from a half-hour examination, to be well worth buying. Although there is competition from heavier (Sybex) and deeper (Cisco) books, this one covers all the necessary topics in a very understandable way. The text is no-nonsense, even tho the section headings are ""dumbie"" puns, as always."
2,It' good movie for the Tushar Kapoor And Emraan Hashmi's Fans,"The film belongs to the romantic/comedy genre, it has been produced by Subhash Ghai and the story has been written and directed by Ashwini Chaudhary. The film stars Emraan Hashmi as Raju Malhotra, Tushaar Kapoor as Rajan Malhotra, Isha Sharwani as Rashmi, Tanushree Dutta as Dinky, Paresh Rawal etc. The music has been composed by Himesh Reshammiya"
4,Very lovely!,"This is a pretty good album. I bought it because of an old record I have of Spanish music of the golden age (a recording that I find superior to this one). This is a wonderful album to have and a very interesting look (listen) into music from 3-4 centuries ago.I think they should have added more songs to the album and it is a bit short, I don't think it even breaks and hour.All in all, it's a pretty good album, but nothing too spectacular."
5,book,It is good and helpful. My husband and I are doing well with learning more about our son and ourselves.
3,hmmmmm,"cant really say what I think about this installment .. I know Jus was I'll on alot of Co-Flows tracks back in the early to late 90's... but I'll have to Come back to you on this one... I have to hear more tracks..Shoulda kept Company Flow together or go join Def Jux....""walt disney meets Kaiser Scoche(sp)""!!"
2,Where are El-P and Mr. Len when you need them???,"Ok, here's the deal. Lyrically, this album is pretty nice and Bigg Jus proves that he is indeed talented. Yet, it is know lyrical masterpiece. That being said, this album is just about intolerable due to its production. While songs like ""Gaffling Whips"" are just plain boring musically, songs like ""Tongue Sandwhich"" are almost painful to listen to. While some call this creative, or abstract hip-hop, I call it [bad]. El-P found ways to make cacophonous sounds work together in harmonious beauty on his solo LP, why couldn't Jus do the same? Maybe its due to the fact that Jus is not a producer by nature. Who knows. All I know is that Jus's nasal flow sounds better over simpler soundscapes than the ones presented on this album. In closing, you should only pick this album up if you are A BIG FAN OF BIGG JUS! Otherwise, wait for his full length solo and leave this failed experiment in its place on the cd rack."
5,off the hook,This cd has what it takes. This is one of my top fifteen of all time and is used frequently for the last two years.
2,horrible G-Funk era comeback!,"I'm surprised that Warren G survived THIS era! The lyrics on the album are bland and you would think that it was just another copycat album of ""G-Funk Era"" if you didn't know it was Warren G rapping on it! I gave it a 2 because 1)he's Warren G and does derserve some credit for trying to punch back and 2)because of couple of the songs were very decent, but most of the album was pitiful.The tracks that made the album worth listening to were ""Annie Mae"", ""Smokin' Me Out"", and ""Relax Yo' Mind"""
2,Dissappointing sophomore effort,"This is the beginning of Warren G's slump of sub par albums. The highlights on this album are few and far between, with one hot track, ""I Shot the Sherriff"". Unless you absolutely need to hear more Warren G, I would steer clear of this. Warren's lyrics are pretty bland and meaningless, which was ok on Regulate...The G Funk Era because they were accompanied by tight beats, but here the beats don't make up for the poor lyrics. Warren's worst album."
2,g-funk is nothing,This cd issssssssss nothinggggg there are only 2 good songs that i like on this album maby the ppl over at weast side love this kind of music but east coast isint down with this g funk garbage warren g isint all that with his lyrics this cd isint worth buying trust me.
5,Spy thriller,Easy read. Ending of movie version better than book. Very British in characters and plot. If you are into Cold War spy thrillers. This is a great book.
4,rounding out a collection,"This version of the John Le Carre classic finishes out the Smiley Trilogy with the same dust jacket cover art, making this the completion to my collection of Smiley novels."
4,Spy thriller,"I have said in reviewing another of his books, that my issue with Mr. le Carre is that he writes in the King's English, which I do not speak. That said, this book has good character development, a good story, is suspenseful and is well written."
3,"Tinker,Tailor, Soldier, Spy","This is an interesting look into the spy world, but as expected, very confusing and hard to follow. I will definitely see the movie in the hope that I will better understand the book. This is a bit of a reversal for me - I usually read the book for clarity and thoroughness and then see the film hoping that it will live up to the book."
3,Difficult to Follow,"I'm having a hard time following characters in the novel. It takes a lot of concentration to keep up with the plot. A classic, but not an each read."
5,This must be the best spy novel ever,"The only thing that you need to know about this book is that you have know idea what the key to the story is unil the last three pages. Until then you will be riveted to the paper and not be able to put it down. I have read my copy countless times. I still find something new. In addition, the BBC's 1970's adaptation of the novel is one of the most aoustanding pieces of television drama I have ever seen. I wish PBS would show it!!"
2,BOORRREING,"It may be blasphemous to criticize an author with the stature of LeCarre', but, I read for enjoyment and found precious little in this work. The usual grist for the spy writer's mill: car chases, fist fights and shootouts, are absent, leaving the reader with a cerebral and convoluted plot that becomes more tedious the farther you read. The story moves along with painful slowness as the Brits try to find a mole in their system through exhaustive attention to every detail of the investigation. This book is definitely not a page turner, and will not keep you up late at night."
5,Best Spy Novel of All Time,"Quite simply the greatest spy novel of all time.In reading the one-star reviews, it's clear that they simply gave up or stopped paying attention, which is a shame. It's true that the book is not a particular easy read. There's not a lot of dialogue or action. You need to have a quiet place to read; you can't read this book with the TV on in the background, and for the first 100 pages or so you will wonder what the hell the point is. But once you get past the first 100 pages, you'll find each page more satisfying than the rest, and find yourself constantly turning back to earlier parts of the book while you admire how a master craftsman puts a work of art together where every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly into place."
5,Awesome,"The book was a fantastic read. Le Carre did a masterful job of bringing in background information of all the characters and bringing them altogether for a fantastic finish. The book keeps you guessing who was the perpetrator. It's a must read. Although it starts off a little slow and confusing but once all the pieces are in place, get ready for page turning excitement."
4,A paradox wrapped in an enigma,"Le Carre transcends the limitations of being a genre writer because his psychological observations about human relationships apply to everyone. We all must deal with sabotage, duplicity, and subtle deceptions in some ways and to some degree, and Le Carre's portrayal of these things is realistic and profound. The extent to which you enjoy this book will depend in large part on how much you like to be kept guessing for hundreds of pages. This goes not only for the ultimate whodunnit of the plot but even for many of the more minor details. For this reason the book requires some patience and gives the intellect quite a workout. But there is considerable achievement in Le Carre's ability to open up new questions even as he is stringing the reader along with breadcrumbs of facts to answer other questions. The result is a hall of mirrors structure to the novel that resembles the very world he is writing about."
1,Disappointed,"I had looked forward to an intriguing, cleverly written novel. For page upon page all I readwas reminiscent, chatty discourse as if it was the only way to fill a page. Did not finish the book,judging that it did not merit the effort. Surprised to later learn that it was made into a movie.Perhaps this will make it a bit more exciting."
2,i hope maybe you will like ti more then i did.,"i listen to audio books all the time. once a month i drive from san francisco to LA. and audio book is a great way to pass the time. i didn't know much about this book, until i saw a trailer for a movie of it coming out in a few months. since, the movie looks great, and something i would like, i thought it would be nice to listen to on my next trip to so cal. about 3 chapters in i had to turn it off. i didn't care for this audio version of the book at all. maybe it was the narrators tone though out or the fact that i had no idea what was going on, what time we were in, or who we were talking about. i am sure people love this book and hold it in really high regards, but i didn't care for it, and i found it to be quit boring."
1,"Tinker, Tailor, Terrible Spy Thriller","Before I saw the movie I thought it prudent to read the book. Bought it on kindle and started in....Forced myself to keep reading, hoping I would figure out the plot, characters, setting, etc. I am 65 years of age and have always been an avid reader, especially of spy thrillers. It was not a thriller. It was more of a ""What the heck?"" I have to say that I have never read a more uninteresting book. Instead of not being able to put it down, I forced myself to pick it up, just to get it over with it.Anyway, I will not be seeing the movie. The book was terrible."
2,Tough sledding,"The use of spy business jargon made the story difficult to read. Maybe I'll watch the movie, and I almost never say that."
3,Newer Stuff Actually Better,"John LeCarre is an old master who, like Phillip Roth, keeps getting better. I am actually a fan of LeCarre's later works and find these cold war stories of Smiley et. al. too dry, and now, too dated. LeCarre has been able to adapt to the changing world order and his newer books reflect this. I suppose if I'd read this book back when it was first published I'd be saying how timely it is. But I've come to these earlier books late, and now I feel I've missed the party. Smiley is a methodical fellow, and in this one, by the time we get to the denoument, it has all suspense of an afternoon tea. Want LeCarre at his best? Read The Tailor of Panama."
3,"Great plot, poor electronic formatting",This story is an intriguing and complex narrative that is often made confusing in the Kindle edition by the absence of appropriate formatting to indicate when the story shifts to resume plots revolving around other characters. It is disappointing that the experience of reading this excellent story for the first time is diminished by the poor standard of electronic formatting.
1,"Tinker, tailor soldier, spy","I have read a lot of Le Carre books, but this one confused me nd I could not get into this book. I did not finish it."
2,Burn after Reading,"To be honest, the plot (which is merely alluded to, and that infrequently) does a bit too much tricky messing around for me to be bothered following it, but I can tell you that the writing that cloaks it is often poor.The Smiley (or Karla) Trilogy picks up a bit in the middle (The Honourable Schoolboy -- 4 stars), and doesn't end all that badly (Smiley's People -- 3 stars), but I didn't like 'Tinker, Tailor, ... '."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"George Smiley is an old spy that is called back to duty to look into a situation at the 'Circus'. The situation is the penetration of double agents into his former employer.A situation obviously reminiscent of, and raking over the coals the Philby, Burgess, MacLean and Blunt years as the highly intelligent Smiley goes after these men."
5,what more could you want?,"Complex plot, vivid characters....who will soon forget shifty Toby, gallant Peter, or the suave Bill Haydon? Accompany George Smiley as he unravels, step by step, an exceedingly well-tied knot in the fabric of an uminaginable treachery."
5,Is smiley le carre,Follow smiley thrrough the think of devious British espionage. Oversea ring commanders who rush too often into the problems faced daily. Smiles more snail like pace o f thoughtful Ali's was not appreciated.. Stay always they man!!
2,huh?,"Well I too was excited to get this book..... I am about 1/3 of the way through it. It is so vedy, vedy British in it's delivery and so uberly filled with Cold War spy jargon that I think I might understand only about 10% of it ( if that much).I keep reading it ...I don't know why. What I find myself doing is reading a bit and then make up what I think is going on. It's kind of fun. I keep hoping something will be said that will acutally confirm what I think is happening. So far that hasn't happened. Actually, I believe I am creating a parallel novel. I am going to read the whole thing as a challenge but honestly.....who understands this? I hope the movie is made for those of us who did not go to Cambridge."
3,"Enjoyable, but not his best","I write this as a complete Carre enthusiast. His works are the top of literature, and yes, with Greene gone, he is the best in Britain. TTSS is alittle hard to get into, but it certainly grabs you by eyeballs once you meet Prideaux (that would be page...uh, 1?). I started reading it knowing who was the mole (The Secret Pilgrim is a spoiler), but that made it more enjoyable in the how-did-he-do-it sense. But if you want to get to know JLC, don't start here. Start with easier reading, such as The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, A Small Town In Germany, or Our Game, or my all-time favourite The Night Manager. Got it? Good. Spying is Waiting./Alec Corday"
2,Disappointing,"Not what I expected at all. The writing style is hard to follow, the story itself appears to be very compelling but I really got tired of trying to work out what the author was trying to put across, there were just so many names, after half I just gave up."
3,"Tinker, Talior, Slolider,Spy",Pure LeCarrer. He is the thinng man's spy. I think that this one was written after he came in out of the cold. It has some time has gone buy markers in it.
4,"Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy","I have not read the book yet, but I saw the movie and that inspired me to read the book. I am sure that it will be as good or better than the movie."
1,Not a good read!,"I found the book hard to read, did not like the writing style at all. Ended up returning the book. I had been looking forward to reading it before I saw the movie. I know in the past I didn't really care for Le Carre books but I thought I'd try again."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for espionage, intrigue, and a book that would keep me on theedge of my seat...instead I found an answer to insomnia. In other words it failedto keep me interested and after a quarter of the book read I quit. It now keeps companywith only 3 others in my life that I had to give up to read something else.Moral of this story...don't listen to hype."
3,65% surcharge for the kindle version (?!?),"Got this for xmas; the kids saved $7 and killed a tree by getting the paperback as opposed to the kindle. Still can't figure these ""convenience"" 65 per cent surcharges. I must be missing something."
5,Engrossing Spy Thriller,"Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. This is my first John Le Carre book and at first I found it a little slow, but quickly found myself sucked into the world of George Smiley and the underbelly of secret agents.Pure enjoyment and escapism, with well developed characters."
4,Book Review,"Complex story, quick read and hard to put down. Very, very English--almost need to a guide to English terminology, but once you get your mind set for the dialoge, it is fairly easy to follow. Facinating story about the cold war era, which seems so long ago and forgotten now, but was so an omnipresent during much of my lifetime.Great story, look past any anti-American aspects, and chalk it up to memories of a faded empire and scorn for colonial upstarts."
5,A Short Review,"I have bought this book twice, read it twice and given it away twice to friends. The first time I read this book I felt that I was working for Smiley not reading a novel. That is how good this book is."
2,disappointed,"I had hoped for a more interesting and entertaining offering, but except for the relationship between Jim and the boy, didn't much care for any of the other characters. Lots of innuendo and unintersting exchanges between just too many charactersl. Hard to keep track of who was doing what to whom. But I did figure out who the bad guy was halfway throuogh."
3,Challenging but enjoyable,"This novel is not an easy reading spy novel as most current spy novels tend to be real page turners. However, I enjoyed it nonetheless and it's worth the effort."
4,Fills in the gaps,"Showing what a literary lowlife I am, I bought this to fill in the gaps after watching the Oldman remake. For those not acquainted with le Carre', this is a rather dense book and you really need to think when reading it, unlike most of the fluff on the shelves at your local brick-and-mortar chain store(s). It's quite riveting - I rode the train totally oblivious to where I was for thirty minutes one morning while reading this."
5,Bought it because of the movie,Saw a movie review on TV and thought this would be a cool book to read though haven't read it yet. Recommended for mystery book reader.
3,good read but dated,"I needed to read this novel after seeing the movie. It filled in a few gaps that confused me in the movie and I enjoyed reading it despite knowing the gist of the story. I thought this novel was too expensive for an older title and balked at the price initially. I felt compromised but I wanted to see what, if anything, was missing from the screenplay. In the end I had to pay the price."
5,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Review","It is a paperback of fine quality. I wanted to read it as I flew on a long flight,and its light weight made it easy to carry around."
2,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy","I thought I would read this book before I see the movie. I will see the movie anyway, but this book was either the era it was written or my inability to appreciate the author's style but I kept falling asleep reading it. Sorry, but I will scratch LaCarre off my list of other books to read."
2,Slow and Difficult Book to Read,"Usually I would enjoy a book that allows you to understand character history but this book takes that to the extreme. I found myself waiting for the intrigue to start and I finally stopped reading the book at 30%. I am sure there are people who would enjoy the level of details and the need to pay true attention to all the minute data points that this book provides however, it is not for me."
1,Very hard to follow.,"I tried reading this book, I really did. 200 pages in, my frustrationabout WHAT IS GOING ON got the best of me, and I gave up. I'm not sayingthe book is bad for everyone, just not my cup of tea. Jargon too heavymaybe. I just don't know."
2,Disappointed,"Jana Perskie's review was helpful but I found I could not get into this book at all, in fact I'm very disappointed with it. The story itself appears to be very compelling but I really got tired of trying to work out what the author was trying to put across, there were just so many names and words I was completely unfamiliar with. The work just doesn't come across as serious writing for what is a ""serious"" subject."
2,"Um, pass ...","Got through the first 15 pages maybe before I decided to ditch this one.It might heat up later, but the only real use for this book is as a sleep aidsnooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrringMaybe the movie will be better, but I'll wait until that's out on DVD.Disappointed, thought this would be half decent."
1,When Am I Going to Learn?,"Just spent my first hour with this book and it's just plain boring and stupid. How this got others to rate it so high is beyond me. Once you've read some really great spy books, this kind of crap is terribly disappointing! I'm not spending any more money on Kindle books! I want my money back! A good book should grab your attention, not bore you to sleep with crap! I warned you! Save your money."
1,Why is this not available in Canada?,Would love to read this but it's not currently an option in Canada (Kindle version). Please bring this to Canada.
2,motorola cell holder,was'nt pleased with it .the side click that holds the phone snaped off after 2 weeks. i had to super glue it in order to use and at that i don't think that will last long.
2,Corny,I bought this as gift for my husband - because he loves westerns and I love Trent Willmon! It was corny as could be! Mel Tillis had some great lines that made you laugh out loud!
4,bad law ain't no law,Two old timers are telling the old time shot out tale.So this is a long term story of two generations of menin the Palo Pinto area of Texas. The current sheriff has murderedthe young man's father in a gun fight where is he was supposed to be backing him up. The double dealings of the sheriff come to a head over a girland a gold mine. It a some old fashioned western with some pretty good costumes and acting and nice western background music.You can expect guns blaising and a backward sort of love affair?
1,not much happens till the end....,I don't know how much of this is suppose to be true and I really don't care. It is very boring and slow. The events that are suppose to be paranormal/creepy include such things as doors opening and winds picking up. I didn't care for the flashbacks in time that are suppose to join the two characters together. The effects were lack luster. I guess the only positive thing I can say is at least there was a ghost in it as opposed to the ghost being a figment of the imagination.
1,Boring and whiney...,"The Legend of Lucy Keyes, when I checked it out at the video store, looks promising. It even has a ""Winner Audience Award Independent Film Festival of Boston"".I though the entire movie sucked.(1) The kids were not acting, but whiney the whole time. It grated on my nerves like fingernails against a chalkboard. Constantly whiney whiney whiney.(2) The parents' acting was very bad, I thought. They too were whiney and got on my last nerve.(3) There was not much of a story in it. Other than irritating the daylights out of me, it was incredibly boring. Where was the suspese? AT WHAT POINT WAS IT SCAREY???? If this movie scares you, so would the cartoon Casper. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING IF THIS IS SCAREY. It's BAD.I thought it a kind of cheap water downed imitation of the movie Poltergeist, which was an awesome movie.I'm just giving you my honest opinion. It was boring, grating on my nerves, and not once ounce of scarey in it. B O R I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!BAD!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Ok movie,"DVD Audio is out of synch! It was hard to watch the film with the lip movement not matching the audio. I dont know if it was bad DVD compression or what.The movie as a whole is generally good, and the features are a nice bonus as well. The only flaw is the audio being messed up."
5,Beyond F.A.T. City,A wonderful informative follow up to the original DVD. Additional information with follow ups from those who attended the prior class was invaluable.
5,A Must Have!,"""F.A.T. City"" and ""Beyond F.A.T. City: A Look Back, A Look Ahead""These two videos should be considered a ""must"" see for parents with an LD child. After viewing these, parents should gift the school with a copy. All educators and staff, including the principals, teachers, secretaries and custodians should be required to view these. Let's get the discussion started and everyone will win."
4,Almost Perfect.,Very nice little Micro Case. The only reason why I deducted a star was because the power supply is only 220 watts. Wish it was bigger but I knew that when I bought it. In fact I am typing this review with the media center I built with it. Front of case looks clean and neat very stylish. All in all a good case.
3,Calc III,"This book was required for my class, however I did not find it a very entertaining read. The pages are very bland and it is hard to sit through. Looking up an example for reference is fine, but unless you need it for class, I'm sure there are better Calc books out there"
3,"Interesting biographical info, needs color!","Part of my low rating has to do with the format of the book, likely nothing the author could control. That is the paucity of photographs of Rembrandt's paintings--and the ones that are here are in black and white, completely insufficient for a book on a painter famous for his use of colors!That said, I did find the facts about Rembrandt's life interesting, not having known them before. Those more familiar with those facts will probably not find anything new here. The author's personal thoughts on similarities between Rembrandt's life and our modern lives are occasionally thought-provoking, as we might notice how life hasn't changed that much in over 350 years. But thost same thoughts are not very penetrating, falling under chapter titles such as ""Trust your own way,"" ""Love leads to forgiveness,"" and ""Age will come."""
3,Painting reflects self,"There is some information on Rembrandt and how his life and work were so related. The book does give a history of his life through the paintings. In some aspect it has merit and reflects on life, but the author is short on detail in both the paintings and life. Roger Housden does a so-so job on the interconnection between life and subject matter of the paintings. A decent overview of the man and his work, but nothing really hard-hitting."
2,Disappointing - perhaps due to translation from another language?,"I purchased this book after becoming intrigued with the plot presented on Amazon.com. While the plot did indeed capture me, several things bothered me throughout the book. Perhaps this is due to a poor job of translation, if the book was indeed translated into English from another language, but there are numerous instances of very odd sentence structure and incorrect use of words which kept me from enjoying it as much as might have otherwise. In addition, the conversation often seemed very stilted and did not flow well, again, maybe due to translation problems. I had difficulty finishing it and only did so because I rarely put down a book without finishing it and wanted to know how it ended. All in all, the book reminded me of a piece of music that is really not very good, and you keep listening to see if it might get better as it goes along, but it never does!"
3,Disappointed,"I was intrigued by the book, until the ending, when Ms. Asensi allowed her character, Sister Salina to fall to one of the seven deadly sins - lust."
3,"Interesting, well-written but ultimately disappointing.","It took me a while to really get into this book. But, after about 30 pages I was hooked. The story started to move more quickly and it was good. I really connected to the characters and their experiences. The one fault for me is the ending. I know, that seems like it should be a major point, but the rest of the book was so good I kind of forgave the author for the ending. I won't give it away of course, but it seemed a little too far fetched, even for this type of story. I'd recommend it, with just the slightest reservation."
3,Good book but...,"I suspect this book is actually beautifully written...in its original language. The translation is very poor. The language is at best odd and at worst, incomprehensible. The translator's voice is very evident and the novel suffers. The translation is so annoying that I can't honestly give it what I think it probably deserves as a rating. Where was the editor? Nevertheless, it's intelligent and intriguing. I just wish I could read it in the original."
2,Editing Help Needed,"The story is intriguing but the writing is weak. I suppose part of that can be blamed on the translation. However, the book needed a serious edit to trim the flab and make the text readable."
2,Information clouds the plot,While this could be an interesting and exciting book I found all of the historical information and quotes from Dante to be distracting and frustrating. It kept the plot in the background too much of the time. While some of the facts were interesting most of it overwhelmed the advancement of the story. The characters were also hard to relate to and believe in. I often found myself shaking my head over a character's actions or responses. Although the premise of the story is quite interesting the writing is not. I found this to be a very frustrating and disappointing book.
2,Simplistic,"While the premise was quite fascinating, the actual book was boring and written in a style reminiscent of books written for teenagers. Characters were quite shallowly written; the end was just a little too wonderful; coonections made in the book didn't always make sense. The whole book was in dire need of tightening and editing. It is possibly a better book in its original language, but I have no way of verifying that."
2,So much potential ruined by a lame ending,"I bought this book because I love historical novels. The beginning of the book was intriguing and it captured my attention. The discription of history and locations and beliefs was facinating. Then at about the middle of the story it began to get silly in spots. But still I was captivated. The challenges and physical tests the three main characters have to endure is punishing, but they continue to push forward. Then comes a total disconnet when Ottavia runs into a childhood ""friend"" who tells her the truth about her family. This exchange does nothing to further the story and seems completely out of place. Finally, the story climaxes with the final challenge and then paradise. As soon as the main characters hit paradise it's as if the author ran out of creativity and instead relied on gimicky, sappy nonsense. The ending takes the book from a 4 star to a 2 star. I would tell people to read the book, but stop after the last challenge."
3,Poor Translation,"The person who translated this work into English did a horrendous job, especially with proper names. For example, the basilica of St. John Lateran became St. John of Letran, and the medieval Dominican Giacopo da Voragine became Santiago of the Whirlpool. As a professional historian who used to live in Italy, I found these especially off-putting. The main character, a Sicilian nun with various PhDs, would have known better, such as that Voragine was not a whirlpool but the town where Giacopo was born. Also, the translator has taken idomatic phrases and translated them literally so that they have no sensible meaning in English. What was a delightful novel in the original language has been ruined by poor translation and poor editing."
3,Rip-roaring ride - pity though about the quality of the translation.,"There is nothing wrong with this as a story - its got all the right ingredients and all the right characters to keep a reader eager to get to the climax. I only wish I knew Spanish so that I could have read this in its original language. The English translation is painful at times. As a professional translator myself, I know the pitfalls. Just because a word or phrase is a perfect translation for the original doesn't mean that it can be used in any situation. In some places I found myself going 'Huh?' as the tone of the second half of a sentence was completely different to that of the first half. Still, translating a novel is never easy and, hopefully, the translator will have learnt from this effort."
5,Excellent Mystery,This was a wonderful book to read and I was sorry when it ended. Great mystery and great characters. I loved reading it and was surprised along the way. I wanted to learn more about the Byzantium history when it ended.
4,Divine Cato...,"Who would have thought to use the Divine Comedy as a sort of Map? I found the characters to be believeable and their conflicts to be real and how they each over came them through the story. The story flows and was quite easy to follow. Travels through countrys around the Meditteranean were vividly portrayed and delightlyfully fascinating. My only issue with the book was the ending. The ending seemed to not quite fit with the story. I do not wish to write a spoiler here, but while I do understand that this was a work of fiction and the portions of the book stayed true to that genre, I felt the ending pushed it way too far to be even minutely believeable. Great book nonetheless."
3,as fascinating as it was embarrasing,"The author did a lot of work on the facts and is obviously conversant with ancient and medieval Christian theology. That part was all well and good, but the personal relationship were cardboard. One dimensional. Unreal. The love story such as it was made me so uncomfortable because I don't know any human being that behave or speak like the two principles did. It was, to be kind, as superficial as possible, but the book still had merit and I didn't have to put effort into finishing it, only effort in skimming over the 'love story'. The ending was unusually well done and certainly the author should receive kudos for that as well as the scholarship that went into the writing of the book."
4,the title was changed in the English version,"As the translator of the book, I probably don't count as an unbiased reviewer. But I learned a great deal in reading and translating it, and I think it is quite ingenious and also devastating. An important book. I wanted to say that the book's English title is considerably more sedate and formal than the Swedish title. Readers like the ones expecting a traditional military history might have been misled by the publisher's decision to omit the Swedish title: ""Bang! You're Dead! The Century of Bombing"" in favor of a more graspable ""The History of Bombing."" You may judge for yourself the impact of the original title versus the changed one."
3,"Engaging story of pioneer on, off the field","This is a readable, well-researched book. Carroll tells how Grange rose to become one of America's first true superstars and how he left school early to join the then-disrespected ranks of pro football. While scholarly, a feeling for a truly humble man shines through."
1,Give it a miss,"The only thing holding the author's theories together is a belief that the Japanese were truly willing to surrender. Japan's culture was steeped in the belief that surrender was a shameful act. The more you study Japan's culture and war tactics, the less likely you will believe this book.Japan was willing to fight to the bitter end, and the end wasn't in sight until the second bomb was dropped. After the first bomb was dropped, the Japanese Army heads were convinced that there were no more bombs available. After the second, they believed that the US had a stockpile of atomic bombs. I wonder what they would have done if they knew there were no more bombs ready? Would they have gone ahead and surrendered, or would they have kept fighting?I wish the author had researched the existing Japanese documents, and used them to write a balanced story. This is revisionist histoy at its worst."
4,"A great read, ignore the nay-sayers!","Far more gripping than the average history text. Very thoroughly researched and compellingly argued. Having just recently read the book, and having it fresh in mind, I'd like to state my reaction to the one-star reviewers below - I can only surmise that they have either:1. Not actually read the bookor2. Read it, while failing to absorb about 90% of it.I say this because every point that the book allegedly ""ignores"" or ""overlooks"" is in fact addressed at length and in great detail therein. The critics below totally distort the arguments actually made in the book. And this straw-man about the Okinawa Battle two months prior..c'mon folks. Japan inflicted heavy losses because they were using their fighter planes as suicide-weapons. Not exactly a strategy bound to endure for very long, is it?This is a valuable contribution to world history. Read it."
5,Dany Rivera's Alborada : Maybe One of His Best Works,"Although the LP was released around 1979-80, the quality of this album is still unsurpassed. Tonaly rich and full of beautifull lirics it can still be considered one of his best works.Although it was eventually involved in a contoversy concerning rights of autorship or some other legal issue,it can be qualified as a good example of good native puertorrican music with a modern twist.Highly recomended."
3,Incomplete,"A word of warning -- The Beatles only appear on 8 of these recordings, 2 by themselves (Ain't She Sweet & Cry for a Shadow) and 6 backing Tony Sheridan (Why; My Bonnie; Nobody's Child; Sweet Georgia Brown; When The Saints Go Marching In (on some CDs ""The Saints""); and If You Love Me Baby (on some CDs ""Take Out Some Insurance on Me Baby)). The remaining songs are either Sheridan solo or with ""The Beat Brothers"", who are NOT The Beatles. If you want to be a completist, this set is almost there, but The Beatles performed one other song with Sheridan, ""Swanee River"", which is VERY hard to find. I would recommend finding a collection with all nine songs."
3,A great CD if your're into the early Beatles.,"If you love the music of the Beatles, you might also like to know where they, musically, come from. In that case this CD is a great oppotunity. With drive and enthusiasm Tony Sheridan and The Beatles give you some of the greatest rock'n'roll songs. Listen and enjoy! However, if you don't know all the later studio work of the Beatles, this might not be the right place to start."
3,hungarian underground,"well, not so good as the '97 or '96 but still enjoyable. to anyone who would like to hear how it all began - go for it. but still strongly recommend the '97 and '96 ones as well as the '98 recycled"
4,cool cut,"back in 92 as the debut single from the film :Boomerring"" this song featured Babyface and a then unknown Toni Braxton. it had the classic LaFace sound and groove, there voices compliment one another though Toni B. sounds like she is singing off a babyface guide track because she mimicks his every vocal tendency and stylings. this is a good track. this was around the prime/peak of Babyface's nusical journey."
2,Sorry I Bought This,I bought this book for the Lynn Kurland story. I haven't read the other three stories and they may be fine. But I have read several of her books so far and they have been so much fun to read with well developed story lines and I love the characters she creates. I also love that they are stand alone continuing family story books.This is a short story so there was no depth of character or storyline. I was very disappointed. It was like it was just thrown together to tell the bare bones of Megan's story. Seems they spent the whole first 3/4 of the story disliking each other and then all of a sudden they were in love. It just needed to be longer and more in-depth in the telling.I will read her other anthologies at the library if they're available before buying them to add to a collection that I will read over and over.
4,Decent bag,"It is by no means a case. Its a padded bag. I bought one for my 72"" level as well. Not bad."
5,Success is Yours in 30 Seconds--With This Book!,"I am currently beginning my second career and needed the Zero to 60 information, now, to level the playing field. You may think, gee, this guy should know all the rules--but my first career was 25 years in the military. Susan Bixler and Nancy Nix-Rice have me confident that when I walk into the interview, I will have the external factors covered (the first 30 seconds)--they even give you hints on how posture, speak, and express the internal you--your knowledge, skills, and ability. I notice people much more now--I look for the suit and tie color, suit make, belts, shoe style, etc., to see the type client the individual is playing up or down to. If you're at all uncertain--this is your next book--you will not be sorry."
3,"Okay, but nothing new here...","It seems that in our ever-increasingly casual society, we have lost some of our common sense when dressing for the office. This book has no surprises - there are no hidden secrets for compiling a work wardrobe - if we put a bit of thought into it, I'm sure most people could determine on their own that belly tops, sandals, frayed jeans, see-through blouses and poor grooming are potentially career-limiting moves.The information in this book is pretty basic. Save your money - you can probably get this quality of advice from Mom - for free."
4,"Excellent book, arrived promptly","This is a great book from a great series of books. I highly suggest it to all couples. Regardless of whether you have a fairy tale marriage or your marriage is on the rocks, this study meets everyone right where they are and gives practical advice to improve oneness in marriage. I cannot say enough good things about this book or the Homebuilders series! You must experience it and its life-changing lessons for yourself. My husband and I have never been happier or more on the same page than after completing these exercises. Don't take my word for it, see for yourself! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain!"
2,You can't use headphone with it,"Once you put the PSP on the docking station, unless your headphone has a special plug can turn around the corner, you cannot access the headphone connector anymore, not even the original PSP remote. This is a big design flaw.Another flaw is the littel metal pieces for charging do not connect to the PSP charging connector at the bottom well. I need to stick something to the back of the PSP so that it can be charged when its sits on the docking."
5,great little thing,"I picked this up not expecting much, because most of the PSP docks I've seen reviewed were crap. But this does the job rather well. All I was looking for was a place to put my PSP when charging & syncing. Once you plug it in to the included USB power/sync cable, the PSP just rests into the dock and happily starts charging. The package claims 2-hours to charge, but I find that unrealistic, though it may be possible with the A/C adapter (I find charging with a USB cable to be slow).I gave it 5 stars, despite the charging claim, because it was exactly what I was looking for."
1,Does NOT work with PSP 2000,"Although it is not stated anywhere on the packaging or on the site, this product will NOT WORK with the PSP 2000 (slim)."
3,Kareem - Were you really changed?,"Having spent time on the White Mountain Apache Reservation, I too, became a changed person due to the people, their culture, their hospitality, and mostly their spirituality. There is so much to learn from the Apache people. Kereem stirred a lot of warm, wonderful memories inside, which left me smiling as I read his words.However, he also stirred a bit of anger and injustice inside of me. On one hand Kareem acknowledges how the Apache are a very private people, and don't like to be singled out. So, instead of respecting that, he writes a book about it. It was probably difficult enough for the boys to be singled out on the court by his coaching, now their lives are out there for the world to read. If the Apache people really changed Kareem, as he claims, I can't imagine he would have chosen to make a profit on exposing their personal lives as he has done. I would think his Apache ""family"" is a bit estranged after this book's release."
1,This book was terrible,"The one adjective the I believe most appropriate for this book is condecending...as Mr. Abdul-Jabbar shifts between random thoughts or facts about Native Americans to flat basketball game descriptions...In absolute terms, for a great view on Native Americans, I am sure there are better books...and I must say that for a better view on basketball, heck, read Dennis Rodman.RR"
5,Great Read,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is a graduating senior in high school. When the book arrived, I read it prior to giving it to her. While it is not the best book for parents, it is a fantastic read for students. I wish it were around when I went to college. It will be the book I give as graduation presents to all of my daughter's friends. I recommend it highly."
5,Power metal rules in SA.,"Power metal fans can now add South America to the list of countries producing outstanding power metal bands. This is really nothing new to the avid power metal freaks who are knowledgable in the power metal genre, but it seem that lately the bands from SA are finally getting their music out for more people to hear. Now to the music. BIH play super fast, melodic power/speed metal with good vocals and catchy songs. I was, and still am blown away at the ability of these guys to play so da##fast and harmonic. The opening track ""Freedom"" will be all you need to hear to know that these guys mean business, and it continues throughout the entire cd. BIH, along with another SA band Hibria, have come up with probably the best 2 releases i have heard in the last 6 months. This one is definatly a must for any metal head."
3,A few Good Ideas,"I read dozens of business books each year to help me grow my business. And just one good idea makes a book worth it. This particular book has several original ideas, but hundreds of ideas that were 'old-hat' even when it was written 9 years ago. Since most people don't have time to read all the small business books that are out there, I would say skip this one - the number of original ideas are not worth the time to find them."
4,Not terrific cinema but...,"...if you want a taste of what is purported to be one of Bollywood's most expensive films, this one gives you lots of bang for your buck (yes, pun intended!)"
1,Disappointing,"I am completely unhappy with this griddle. The main issue is that the angled sides leave very limited room for cooking pancakes, which is what we usually have when camping. It would have been better if it was made with a larger flat surface with a small lip around the edge. Also, the non-stick surface has not held up, even with careful use. It certainly needs to have a thicker coating of more durable material. Finally, this Coleman griddle doesn't fit on the Coleman 2-burner stove--go figure. I suppose it might be good for making a really big omelet, though that's not something I typically cook in the woods. Overall, I think it's a poor design and I'm sorry I didn't return it immediately."
2,Griddle too small,"This griddle is too small to fit over both burners and too big to fit over one. It wasn't worth the money at all. The quality of it was decent, though."
1,Not worth it,"Have to give this a one-star. Definitely not worth the money. You can get this identical product at Wal-Mart for $13.99, but it's not even worth that. It fits over both burners of a Coleman stove, but the griddle only heats directly over the burner. The griddle doesn't evenly heat. And most importantly, it is definitely NOT nonstick. The first time I used the griddle, I made pancakes, and from the first pancake, all stuck to the nonstick surface. Subsequently, it appears as though the surface was burned off by the heat of the burner (even though it was on low). Now, I have a useless griddle. I will pay more money for a heavier griddle next time."
3,"Nice, But Mostly Imitation.","I've liked Daniel Licht's work in the past. He worked with Christopher Young on many occasions. His work is obviously greatly influenced by Mr. Young. It seems he would be an obvious choice to score a HELLRAISER film. However, his score just seems to imitate what Young has already brought to the table. It's nicely composed, just too darn close to the original music (which also makes an adapted appearance). If you're really interested in the music for HELLRAISER, stick with the original or even HELLBOUND by Christopher Young. If you are interested in Daniel Licht, check out BAD MOON and THINNER. This score is for Licht or HELLRAISER completists only."
2,"Good footage, bad idea","This is a compilation of footage, and for that it is great however the video is disorganized and there is no narration so it is difficult to watch, particularly if you were not there or do not have someone who can narrate it with you."
2,Unimpressed,"I was in Fallujah for this operation and missed all the broadcast news coverage at the time. I was hoping to see...well, something more than what I got. I would have been mildly disappointed if someone had given this to me for free."
2,overpriced,"interesting combat footage. since the film is ""as shot,"" it can be a bit difficult to follow at times. the best aspect is that it shows what really happened rather than someone's version. given that there are no actors, no real editing involved, cost should be in line with other videos. appears only effort involved was copying, so why so expensive? I'ld pass given the ""bang for the buck."""
4,"Okay, if you are a Marine...","Bought this for my husband, who was in Fallujah during Operation Phantom Fury. It was a bunch of random film footage by some Marines. Neat, except other branches of the military fought in the battle too."
3,One sided on the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.,"This book was written in 1967 and extolls the virtue of the Serbian people and the murderous ways of the Austrians. In 2007, we know a little more. Their were elements in the Serbian government that plotted to kill the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne. The Austrians were benovolent despots, unlike the other empires or the Yugoslav kingdon. One third of the Bosnia may have wanted the Serbs as rulers, but the other 2/3s didn't particularly care for the Serbian kingdon. Feuerlicht eulogizes the Serbs at the expense of the Austrians. A more proper summary without the Serbian myth making would be adviseable with today's knowledge.This is not a good perspective on the act that caused World War I. The author of the tihis book paints a glowing picture of Serbia. A more even analogy is necessary."
4,Bushnell Yardage Pro Laser Rangefinder,"This little unit works well - I use it for getting distances from buildings to telephone poles for my job - The only problem I have had is finding a reflective service on the building I am trying to measure - I am usually about 300 yards or so away - I t does work but I have to take two to three ""shots"" at it before the rangefinder acquires the distance. I have been thinking about getting a red reflective board I can place next to the building when the distance if farther away - red seams to reflect better. All in all I am pleased with this little unit - Kenley"
4,Perfect Starter Range Finder,"I bought this for hunting and shooting on the range. Worked perfect for me and great for the price. Sometimes it is a little difficult to find small objects, but I was able to pick up birds at 100+ yds no problem. The price is great for what you get."
5,Was it worth it?,I purchased a mechanical water sensor to replace a defective unit on my antique John Deere. It works like /as it should. I would have liked some way to alter the background image so I could make it represent more of my application using a simple computer printer. Yet otherwise it is nice knowing when the tractor is working hard that it wont be burning off the coolant. Plenty of adapters to chose from in case of some other style fit. It was not needed as I had my old parts and it dropped in the hole just like it was made for my application.
1,Sunpro CP8217,When I got the gauge it was reading 140 degrees. After I installed it and warmed the car up it was reading 250 degrees. Obviously not working properly. I returned it and bought a cheaper gauge that works much better. Was not happy with the quality for the price I paid. I'm sure not all their gauges are this bad I was just the lucky one this time.
4,over priced,"I wanted to buy this from amazon to save some money. checked with autozone and it was five dollars cheaper, will just buy it from there.Put the guage in the truck last night and was very easy to instal and works great. great guage for the money."
4,Lightweight,Lightweight hedge trimmer for home use. Has enough power for typical foliage shrubs with a long enough bar to make short work of most trimming.
3,What is the content ?,Before I can place a purchase order I need to know how much Chromium and how much Vanadium each cap has. Please publish this information !
5,helps keep blood sugar down,taken as directed should be safe.I take this daily and am very pleased with results. My blood sugar is now below 90 and I won't be worrying about becoming diabetic. But diet is also part of why the blood sugar is down.
2,"Oldsmobile91, ""MAKE IT OR BREAK IT VIDEOS""","These two rap stars should not be compared together. This video was a big disappointment to me, why did they have the same Ice Cube songs, it was the same songs that they had in Cube battles Jay Z. But Puffy's stuff was not even good, just take my word for it ""Don't bother watching this."""
3,Strecthing Story Line,I thought the book was nice. I stayed up all night reading it. But I felt that Kayla was strecthing the story line out so the the book could be 200+ pages. Kelly and Ashton was getting boring after going back and forth with the same issues. I felt they were playing games with each other.
5,Fool for Love,"Kayla Perrin is a prolific writer who always delivers. In this subjective marketplace she deals with issues that all of us can easily identify with. Her writing is engaging and entertaining. So do yourself a favor and take Tanya up on her offer to send you the book for free, she obviously has more money than brains."
1,Abject Mediocrity in Full Bloom,"Reference point: I admire and enjoy the work of Nielsen, Langgaard, Holmboe...however this Syberg ""find"" is bottom fishing.Often there is ample reason works go unperformed and ""neglected."" In this case it is that Syberg had little to say and is utterly dwarfed by better known Danes. These are works written simply becuase the composer could write, not because he had great talent or a vision for the ages. Indeed, the works are very very dull and without the many elements of rare genius found in so many symphonic works of composers named above. The performances are equally dull. This is one of those CD discoveries that yields little for the listener. Skip it."
3,Winnie the Pooh projector,"This product is pretty good for a product under $20.00.Pros: The music feature on the item is good has about 3-4 songs that you can change with the touch of a button, it has volume adjustment and is very loud and clear. Has a crib light and also projects Winnie the Pooh characters onto the ceiling.Cons: The projector part of the item has a small bulb where it reflects the light into a plastic cylinder that when it rotates the light escapes through opening that are in the shape of the characters. The problem I see is since it's a small bulb and the cylinder is poorly painted with characters they projection is not all that clear.Final verdict. Would I way to buy it? Yes its worth it, plus it gets the job done."
2,Not near as good as I thought it would be!!!,"I thought the lights would really show on the wall, but it doesn't show very good. Plus, the light wheel turns so slow it didn't really get my baby's attention. The music is good though. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known what I know now."
1,Noise,"Unfortunately I didn't like this product because it makes a noise when it works. I can't hear the song and the light, the projection is not so good. It is almost impossible to see the Pooh characters' projection."
1,Don't buy it!,Terrible product! It doesn't work at all as it shows on its box.I put one star just because I had to mark one. It doesn't deserve even a half star.
1,"Blurry, useless","We bought this item after reading raving reviews from others in Amazon. The toy simply does not work for us. First of all, the lamp is so weak unless the room is pitch black, you cannot see any light. Second, even at pitch black, unless the toy is 2 feet from the ceiling, the images are completely blurry, and not interesting to our toddler.Since my wife is busy with the toddler, we did not manage to return it in time for a refund, so now we have a useless hunk of plastic gathering dust in our cabinet."
5,Mother of a late talking 2 yr old Son,"Highly recommend all of Bee Smart Baby videos. My son loves them and started saying the words while watching it for the first time. These are videos your child can watch without Mom or Dad around unlike the Baby Einstein. I put one in if I'm cooking dinner or showering, but most of time we do watch it together so I can hear him talk!!"
3,Meet the Parkers...,"This is cheesy, old-school acid house, in the vein of Lords of Acid, Human Resource, old Jam & Spoon, etc. Lots of spooky synth stabs, minor keys, loopy beats, strange samples, and even some of the ridiculous rave-rapping that every old-school raver-at-heart secretly loves. There are a few mellower tracks, too, although they're pretty forgettable.Go ahead, indulge in the pure cheesetasticness, and pretend that it's 1992 again. If you like this genre, you'll enjoy this CD. Everyone else will probably just wonder what our problem is."
2,That's TOO bad!,"I'd say that the book is great in that way, that there are shet music to 60 songs. But several of the notes from the new ones like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Herkules and Beauty & the Beast, are MISSING! The notes to x the first verse - just isn't there!But, still a good book"
4,"Red Ryder Double Feature, Vol. 3",I remember setting around the TV on Saturday morning watching Red Ryder. Boy that was the good old days. I think our kids missed a great era.
1,the prince of kitsch,"if you have heard of Schnabel, the illustrations in this book will persuade you that it's best not to see his work."
4,Excellent video! Faithful to the comic!,"The Adventures of Tintin, Need I say more? This children's video is great! If you have read any of the books you will love the video. I wish there were more titles in English! The story and artwork are very faithfull to the Artwork of Herge. One drawback is that this is part 1 of a 2 part story! The second part being ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" To bad Sony didn't make this a 2 part set. Even knowing this, it is worth the purchase! Follow Tintin, Snowy, Capt Haddock and friends as they unravel the mystery of the 3 Unicorns (ships) and the pickpocketer who keep stealing the bumbling detectives wallets! Tintin buys and old ship model for Haddock. Hidden in the mast of this model is an old parchment with clues to a hidden treasure! Tintin is held captive because theives believe he has the missing parchments. Watch as Capt Haddock and The Thompsons help save the day!"
1,Bad from the start!,The first time I unzipped it to check it out the zipper was not working correctly. It does not close as it splits open in the middle of the zipper and you can not fix it as you have to unzip to zip again only to have it happen again. I am very displeased with this item!!!
2,Bad Zippers,"I recently purchased this wallet to take with me on a 2-week vacation. It had all of the features I wanted, but the zippers are awful. It's not that they got stuck, but you'd zip it closed and there'd be an inch gap of where the zipper didn't close completely. Not helpful when you purchase a zippered wallet to keep all of the contents safe!"
5,Talk about Pleasure!,"With elegantly-crafted understatement Tommy Hays compassionately relays problems spawned by ""Alzheimer's in the family."" At the same time, he manages to sensitively honor the reader's comfort zone. The result is a triumph for the author, for the reader, and for characters whose real life challenges and choices point the way for the rest of us. Thank you, Tommy Hayes."
5,if you've ever loved somebody,"If you've ever loved somebody who was on the decline, this is the book to read. It's a un-depressing look at Alzheimer's set into a family of characters I felt I was coming home to. I had a hard time putting it down."
5,"the pleasure was mine, too","this is an absolutely fine book, a wonderful read, and so uplifting. i don't know why more authors and publishers don't wirte and print books like this. it is so nice to read a story about ordinary folks and how real character carries them through the twists in their lives. you feel that you are right there with the folks, and you learn a few things about life.it is a supurbly written story and so nicely crafted so that you can drift along with this family easily. also, he has touched on many difficult issues and poingnant themes without pulling too hard on the heart strings with mushy wording. a real trick, that.a truly enjoyable read. get a copy for yourself, and send one to a good friend. dgs"
5,A humanizing work....,"Tommy Hays has achieved that delicate balance of realism with affection for imperfect characters in dealing with the family tragedy of Alzheimer's. His narrator is a retired working man unflinchingly aware of his persistent shortcomings, forgivably nostalgic, and a prime candidate to feel that his wife's Alzheimer's has short-changed their golden years. But despite his emotional absence from a half-century of marriage, he manages to show up for that long goodbye that Alzheimer's affords yet so few of us fully embrace. This is a humanizing work by a gifted and caring writer."
5,candlesticks,Purchased for a wedding gift. They were the right price and arrived in excellent condition and as expected. I would order again.
3,P.M. Dawn Remix EP,"This Remix EP (Gee Street/LaFace 24039-2) contains 5 versions of the song: 1. Extended Remix Radio Edit, 2. Extended Jeep Mix, 3. Remix Dub, 4. Remix Instrumental and 5. Album Version."
5,Ambush In The Ashes,Great book and great story with a great action sequence. Characters are well thought out and sequence of events is riveting
1,this is the only book in the series that was a wast of money,"""ambush in the ashes"" is a virtual carbon copy of the books, in this series, on invading europe."
3,"WE KNOW HIS&REBEL PHY,NEED MORE TO FILL IN MOE ACTION","The book is good,but the Author needs to stop waisting space with the same old heart and song story of why the rebels and their phy was founded need more action. Maybe a story or 2 about Bubby, Tina,Anna,or just not fill in the spaces with all Bens going on about the SUSA.We know all that."
1,Five star photos at a one star price,"I recently reviewed a remarkable book of Link's photos:O. Winston Link: Life Along the Line: A Photographic Portrait of America's Last Great Steam Railroadand checking on what other material was available came across this gallery catalog. The prices asked for this slim twenty-four brochure are laughable. I bought a copy when it was published by the London based Photographers' Gallery in 1983. Back then Link was mostly known by railroad fans but the exhibition, which travelled round Britain from 1983 to 1986, really put him on the map in Europe.There is nothing in this catalog that isn't in the latest Abrams book where the photos are beautifully printed with a 200 screen. The eighteen images in 'Night Trick' are printed in a mediocre 150 screen but it is only a catalog with a selection from the forty photos that were in the exhibition.I've upload all the spreads from Night Trick so you can see what the inside looks like."
5,night trick book,"Excellent book; fantastic photographs. Very well packaged and a decent price considering it is brand new (shrink-wrapped) and I saw a copy for three times as much offered for sale at Amazon. My husband loves trains and mentioned this book to me in passing, never realizing I was looking for a gift for our upcoming 20th anniversary; can hardly wait for January! Thanks for offering it!"
5,Music no Handel lover should be without,"This is a delightful album. The choir sings with enthusiasm and the soloists are a who's who of British Baroque performers. Of particular note is Michael George, who is in fine voice and who has one of the most beautiful solos on the album -- Thy Wife Shall be as the Fruitful Vine -- accompanied by Jane Coe on cello.The recording is spacious, yet the sound is clear and focused. Highly recommended."
4,Ultimately received,Did not receive the original shipment. Emailed seller who did not respond for 2-3 days. But I did ultimately receive the item.
2,Fifty Fifty,"About half the songs are great old songs I'm familiar with, the other half are songs made famous by other artists and most are clangers for Elvis that are painful to listen to."
1,Not worth it.,"Recordings sound like they were all done the same day,in as little time as possible, with the least amountof studio talent. Terrible."
3,HDD mounting bracket,"does not have correct holes for Dell desktops/towers, but a little drilling can solve that issue. otherwise, they are metal and therefore can't be all bad."
5,Works Beautifully,"It took some trial and error to figure out how these work but once I did get it, they really did the trick. I was able to make use of what was wasted space in my empty 5.25"" bays and I was able to remove my HDD cages for better air flow inside my case. The brackets come with screws for mounting to your HDD and they also come with screws for mounting to your case. I will be buying more of these."
1,not a perfect fit,"i managed to connect this ""adapter"" to my 3 1/2"" drive, but when i went to place the expanded drive into my 5 1/4"" bay, it was about 1/4"" shy. maybe it would work with some other bay, but not mine. useless."
4,Works as advertised,the work just fine. my only problem was getting the brackets attached to the drives because the screws were extremely tiny.
2,Pay a little more,"These are the cheapest hard drive mounting brackets available on Amazon, do yourself a favor and get one of the more sturdy and pricey offerings. You will get what you pay for which isn't much, and the stress of clanking these together into place. And I mean clanking as these clearly are not machined properly."
2,No instructions?,It would have been cool to have just the most basic tips on how to install this. I check the startech website and also nothing there.
2,not what i expected,"well,.... the material and construction of this item is good, but.... if you want a clean look of any 3.5 something on your case this is not the product for you, this is more for the one that just want to put an extra laptop hdd hidden behind the 5.25 case bay."
3,Not-so-universal mounting brackets,"I purchased a Kingston solid-state-drive for the desktop PC that I was building, but mounting brackets were not included. So, I ordered these mounting brackets at a very good price with shipping, hoping they'd work. Alas, they were not suited to my application since holes on SSD did not line up. However, after trying all schemes and orientations, I was able, using the included screws, to use the brackets to mount the SSD along the side of the bay structure. It is secure and since the drive is an SSD, the alignment shouldn't be a problem.The product was delivered promptly."
4,"They Work, Instructions Might Have Been Nice","Overall, these hard drive mounting brackets serve their purpose. I had a file server I needed to add another drive too, but didn't have a 3.5"" drive bay for. These brackets allowed me to mount it in one of my unused CD-ROM drive bays. My only issue with these is that upon removing them from the package it is not terribly obvious how you are supposed to mount these to your drive. Eventually, I reasoned that the side with four holes must be for attaching the brackets to drive bay itself and that the other holes must be for the drive. However, after spending 10 minutes figuring this out, I thought it would have been nice if they just threw in a picture which showed the proper way to attach them!Anyway, the bottom line is I'd buy these again in a heart beat."
4,When you need them these are great,These brackets allowed me to mount a third hard drive in an APEX mini-itx case in place of the DVD drive. This is my present server. Three 3 terabyte drives bought on Black Friday configured in RAID Z using FreeNAS 8.3.0 operating system. A server so small it sits on a shelf and nobody even notices it. The brackets are a necessary part of the system.
3,Out of this World,"The orchestra and singers are truly great.However the production is very space age, and at times it seems like watching an episode of ""Star Wars"". It even has the ""warp speed"" effect."
1,"The Ring for people into ""Circe de soleil""",What stupidity. What extreme excess. What has any of this nonsense got to do with Wagner's vision? A very mediocre performance with an enormous budget. A very dismal sign of the times.
2,Great singing by a talented 300 lb woman,"The sound & picture quality is very good. But the main female singer playing Brünnhilde, who dominates the scene for about half of this opera, is hopelessly obese.... (well, so is the tenor playing Siegfried)Her singing is great, no doubt. I think if this was a CD audio, I would give 5 stars for her performance. But this being blu-ray, with elaborate visual spectacles with segway, human pendulum, etc, I believe the soprano who is playing a beautiful Valkyrie needs to be also visually convincing."
2,Approach with caution,"The idea of using CG effects and acrobats in this Ring is great. Unfortunately the effects mostly are just a distraction, having nothing to do with the music, and the great moments of the score usually go for nothing.Mehta's conducting is good. Indeed it's the best part of this Ring. The singing ranges from passable to execrable. One can hardly blame the singers, however, as they have to deal with the most ghastly, ludicrous costuming I've ever seen. This aspect of the production is nothing short of disgraceful.My strongest criticism, however, goes to the vision editor of the DVDs. The lengthiest shot might last for about 4 seconds, and the constant cutting back and forth is infuriating.A great opportunity, largely wasted."
3,"Moonlight mohair yarn, glacier bay","I have not started my scarf yet, but the yarn is alot thinner than pictured. I'm sure the scarf will not be very heavy. The color is pretty. I planned to make scarves for the family to wear with their coats, but they will probably be more for wearing inside with a sweater or blouse."
3,Machine generated?,"Likeable little book (pix by Donald Baechler). Limitation by form - here the sonnetesque, lite - always risky, but this is engaging unpretentious stuff - better by far than the full-blown but virtually contentless rhyming variety like Karen Volkman's Nomina. I liked (eg) Exercise(p30) and the baseball one on the page before - and the analyst one three pages earlier.. Only 600 of 'em out there. Great stocking-filler. Get yours now!Later: I have to confess I got overexcited and penned the above prematurely. As the previous reviewer gently intimated, this gets seriously hard going - in my case, about page 33! 4.5 stars for looks, 2.5 for content"
1,Facsinating look into a puzzling disease,"Mr. Fowler's book, The Unwelcome Companion, is the first I've seen which truly gets inside the mind of those with TS. Many books are available about Tourette syndrome, but most are either written from the point of view of observing physicians or written by patients who are explaining the social problems created by symptoms. While these books are certainly valuable (and Fowler provides an adequate overview of these points), the Unwelcome Companion zeros in on the deep, mysterious ""entity"" known as Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome, allowing the reader to ""live"" tics and obsessions"
2,DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS...,"This slender tome gives the reader a non clinical, layperson's peek into the world of those who suffer from the little understood malady known as Tourette Syndrome. The author, who himself has this disorder, speaks about the various manifestations of Tourette Syndrome and gives a brief historical overview of this malady. While informative, it fails to capture the reader, who comes away knowing a little more about the disorder, but never fully comprehends what life was like for the author who grew up with Tourette Syndrome, though tantalizing glimpses are offered. So, if one were looking for a personal memoir of a person growing up with Tourette Syndrome, this would not be that book. If one merely wants a layperson's synopsis of Tourette Syndrome, then this book may be of some value."
2,Winning Strategies for Video Poker,"This was probably a great book when first printed, around 1997, but it doesn'tcover most of the games I now find in the Las Vegas casinos."
2,Can't beat the system,"There is a reason casinos have all those big bright lights and fancy rooms. It is because they have the edge on all the games. In the long run, even with books like these, they will get your money. This book was entertaining, but is by no means the road to riches. I'd say ""good luck,"" but luck is a myth."
4,Good collection of French songs,"Dame Janet Baker is in fine voice on this CD of French art songs by Faure. I like Faure songs, they have more substance than most French art songs, and Ms. Baker's full mezzo voice is just my cup of tea for these songs.OK, so I don't particularly care for the Songs of Eve of the CD's title, but there are plenty of other songs here to love. For example, some of the standards like Apres un reve, Les Roses d'Ispahan, Mandoline.There are also some I heard for the first time and fell in love with, like Les Berceaux, Toujours!, Aurore, and En priere.If you like the whispy, soft French art songs, you probably won't like this CD. But if you like full-throated singing of French songs, you'll be pleased with this CD."
2,Not Baker's best,"Janet Baker is NOT in fine voice as one reviewer suggests. Her voice has gotten fat and has a distinct wobble. If you're looking for the Chanson d'Eve, another recording is Phyllis Curtin's Faure/Debussy set. Again, not Curtin at her finest, but a very interesting disc and worth a listen. Other than that cycle, the other songs can all be heard in better performances than Baker's by other interpreters.If you want to hear fine Baker recordings, check out her Dido & Aeneas, Cosi Fan Tutte, and Kindertotenlieder."
2,Warning - 46F minimum temperature,"I bought this 'refrigerator' for my office hoping that it could both keep champagne cold for special occasions and keep milk for my nearby espresso machine. Unfortunately, refrigerators should be 40 degrees F, while this device has a minimum temperature of 46 degrees F, which is pretty useless for storing milk. Champagne's recommended serve temp is 43-48 degrees, so I suppose it does do the job it was designed for. But don't be misled by this thing being called a 'refrigerator'-- it's more properly a wine cooler. How I wish I could find a silent Peltier-cooled 40 degree fridge!"
4,Excellent for personal money and life management......,"Excellent for personal money and life management, very limited in investment management information and techniques. Protecting, Excellent; (and Growing) unfortunately is below what I expected."
2,Hard to listen to.,"I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings.The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right.Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record.For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' ""Freak In"" or the aforementioned E.S.T."
4,Don Cherry Moments,"My first CD from Nils, will check out more.There are sections of Khmer where his playing reminds me of Don Cherry from his Codona or Multikulti eras. I love Cherry, but there's only so much available of that sound, so to hear it in this Cd was delightful. If that sounds intriguing to you, I'd say check this Nils CD out.But Cherry is not the only sound here. Much is B+ Laswell-ish and that's fine in my book.There is a spot or two with a sort of Death Metal-ish growling which I could definitely do without. There lies the 4-star rating rather than 5-star.ps - The ECM sound that I'm familiar with is smoother than Khmer, think snowy Winter. This is more assertive, different from the ECM pack."
4,And just when I thought nobody was doing this.,"Thank you ECM for once again dragging us onto the breach. There is not one point on this album I don't really like. Strange how exceptional hornplayers just seem to rise up when everyone least expects it. Molvaer's level of imagination in each track is spectacular. The arrangement, rather than solo, however, is where the true splender of this album lies. There is also a bonus CD. Make sure you get it. If I had an entire disk of ""Platonic Years"" the remix from the bonus disk, I assure you, my sexlife would improve to a point of significantly altering the global temperature. ""Khmer"" has made the top ten list of my collection, easily. If you enjoy Molvaer, check out Russell Gunn, another Mad Hornplayer. I just reviewed ""Ethnomusicology"" (4 Stars), and I just ordered ""Love Requiem,"" So give me a few days."
2,cisco kid,"While the sounds are sophisticated and well produced (that is why it gets 2 stars), they seem as personal as someone's stock portfolio. Start out with Africa and India, when you get to the bridge, sell India and buy Indonesia.Another metaphor for this music is a real estate agent. A real estate agent will show you this house with all these beautiful rooms. But a real estate agent never lives in that house. That house never becomes the expression of that real estate agent.It is all that impersonal, this music is like the real estate agent.It would be better if the musicians would play the music with the passion had by living in it rather than acquiring it."
1,No spare parts to cover warranty and washer stalled after 1 hour of use,"Beware !! I bought one of this units in Venezuela about two months ago, and after using it for 15 MINUTES the high pressure hose broke. Yes, the equipment has a warranty, but the local dealer is out of the replacement parts needed and will not exchange the equipment for a new unit (which has probably the same problem); B&D; Service Net site in USA states that the spay gun and hose needed are back ordered and that there is ""no release date at this time"" for the parts. It sucks !! I totally lost confidence in B&D;, will buy it never again !As last, after a 2 months wait, I got the replacement gun and hose. Then, I began to wash my patio and, after aproz. 1 hour of use, either the motor or the pump stalled !!! This washer is definitively a pice of junk ! If I could rate it with negative numbers I would."
1,Book cover was reverse and up side down,I received the book with the book cover upside down and reversed with respect to the book.
4,Sieg the Magnificent,"If you like boxers, be sure to read this book, yes, it's geared to children, but it's a can't miss to any boxer lover or dog lover in general."
1,Hatchet Job by unsympathetic author,"This book is good as a factual guide about la Davis' life. But the author sneers and blasts nearly all of Davis' movies, merely repeating what other uninformed hacks have critiqued. He misquotes all over the place. Instead of Davis saying in the movie ""Beyond the Forest"" the line: ""If I don't get out of here, I'll die!"", the author has her saying ""I've got to get out of here!"" His contempt for his subject makes him a very unlikely candidate to asess this great artist whose movies today hold up better than nearly any other star of the 30s and 40s. While he completely destroys Davis' films like ""Beyond the Forest"" and ""In This Our Life,"" both films have generated tremendous re-evaluations for being the masterpieces they are."
3,All you ever wanted to know about Bette,"Randall Riese takes a different approach to the life of this legend than other authors have done in the past. The result is a virtual encylopedia of Bette's life and career. This book is a good reference tool for the begining davis fan. You can look up her films, her co-stars, directors, almost anything. The book is filled with info nuggets and photos that haven't been published before."
4,Pleasing Bette bio filled with facts,"A lexicon of Bette Davis. Unique in its style, but thoroughly enjoyable. What's great about it is the fact that you can pick and choose which topics you'd like to read about, and skip over those that don't spark your interest. For example, it lists every street address and city in which Bette lived, and in what years. Unknown facts like those make this book exciting to read. And being from Boston, born and raised, anything on Bette Davis (especially since I can actually visit her homes in Lowell & Newton) is worth reading. In response to one of the previous customer reviews on this book, yes it's true that this author does bash and criticize nearly all of Bette's films. I heartily disagreed with some of his reviews, but just remember, everyone's entilted to his or her own opinion. What they say is not gospel. A great concise conpendium of facts perfect for the Bette Davis fan."
5,Very golden!,"The CD makes you want to close your eyes and sway to the soothing rhythm. The words are a window into his soul. His voice is very powerful; makes you want to follow. The poetry is very consuming.The last song is moving. First time you hear it, you feel his sorrow, but his hope for his future. Second time, found myself reflecting on all the crossroads I had ever come to. It was quite the journey.Bottom line - The Last Great Golden Temptation ~ very golden!"
3,Cute but small,"I really like this wig, it looked great when I took it out of the package. Two problems: The white bow that is supposed to come with the wig was missing and the wig itself runs rather small. It barely fit my petite 9 year old. A wig cap and bobby pins to hold in place are a must for this wig, but it's terribly cute!"
4,Pay attention to the size!,"I was in a rush to buy this wig, and didn't realize that it was a child's size! Regardless, it is a very nice wig that looks just like Lucy's hair. It was perfect for the costume party I went to... it was just a little small! Oops."
5,Tapestry Weaving: A Comprehensive Study Guide,"As a new weaver, I am finding this book to be very informative. It covers all the basics from equipment , estimating materials, techniques for tapestry weaving, as well as patterns for projects. The photographs are lovely and an inspiration to me to design my own tapestries. Like the author, I already have many ideas and not enough time to accomplish all I can imagine. I am reading through the book now in anticipation of beginning a project.Tapestry Weaving is going to become a valuable reference guide to my weaving library."
5,I know it will be great if I ever get around to using it,I haven't used it yet. That's how much I hate filing. But this sorter is well made and sturdy to the touch. I can see that it will make filing a breeze! If only it would put the papers away too.
4,Tannhauser,"It always amazes me how good Traubel and Melchior were in live performances. Given the limited amount of material in which these two are featured, this is a wonderful experience. They are in their prime and the quality of their performance makes you forget how murderously difficult the Wagner was/is! Exemplary performances."
4,"Great Book, one to keep by your side while in AE","This book is everything I had expected it to be. Not a tutorial book, but more a reference tool. Get in a jam, look it up and you will get ideas on how to get out, or workarounds."
2,Advice NOT instruction,"I was looking forward to this book for awhile because no one had really gone into special effects compositing specifically before. This book has nice full color photos, and that's the only truly appealing thing I can really say. There really aren't any tutorials in this book to follow. You recieve lots of advice, and some of it is helpful but there are no example files for you try what he suggests. There are all these full color photos for you to see what happened to an image, but without the image you cannot try to replicate it. I had to resort to finding images off the net that were as close as I could come, and of course the differences were enough that it wasn't very helpful. The whole chapter dealing with fire basically tells you that you can't do good realistic fire in AE so look so go make your own or look somewhere else, kind of a waste. Very dissapointed, I learn by doing and yet there is no real practicle application in this book for me to learn by."
5,Finally!,"I'm a fairly experienced After Effects user and I have been waiting for a book like this for a long time. I don't use AE for motion graphics, I use it for fx and compositing and in the 3 days since I got this book my mattes have been much cleaner and my composites are already looking better. This book is awesome, it has opened my eyes to new techniques I never thought were possible with AE. I highly recommend this book if you are an intermediate or advanced user using AE for fx and compositing rather than motion graphics. If you are into motion graphics get the ""Creating motion graphics with After Effects"" series of books. This book has gotten me excited about After Effects again. Thanks Mark!"
2,For advanced users,This book is for ADVANCED users. Do not purchase this book if you are a novice. The author gives many strategies on how to create special effects but rarely tells you HOW to do them in a step by step process. I gave it 2 stars because I am a novice and was looking for step by step special effects.
1,Missing files to work with,Where are the files to work along with? He talks about crucial techniques but you can't follow along with them.
5,A Rare Feat,"I loved and admired Finding Celia's Place. Celia Morris has managed the rare feat of telling her own story with enough distance and reflection to give it real perspective. It was unsparing but understanding -- of herself, others, and the times. At the end, she seemed to have achieved the kind of joy that comes only from the hard work of living one's convictions."
3,"Handle coming apart, but nice size.","Overall we have been happy with this basket, used on our gas grill. Veggies still fall thought the grate, but turning is a breeze. The wood seem to be separating from the metal handle though, and we have not used it that much. Also, it is too big for the dishwasher."
3,"Cheaply Made, but Works","The Good:* the price (you get three cutting handles, several blades, and a magnetic holder for five bucks)Keep in mind that not all the blades pictured fit the larger cutter. It will not grip the narrow base, so those blades are for the smaller handles.* the magnetic strip works and makes it easy to put away/take out new blades* the blades are sharp, but haven't tested how long they hold an edge.Otherwise, this has the feel of a cheap product:* the tabs on the case hinge crumbled as it was taken out of the packaging(maybe these have been sitting in the sun a long time)* the case won't stay shut (the latch was improperly manufactured)* the largest cutting handle is a bit shorter/lighter than higher-quality models (this could be considered a benefit for those with small hands)"
2,"Cheap, but I should have known","This set of craft knives came in a useless plastic case, and they don't seem to hold the blades very well. If you are looking for any measure of quality, don't buy these."
3,For one time use? Maybe...,"Junk - Package was stapled shut when I recieved it. Blue case hinge was broken and the latch looked like it had been chewed on by a small dog. Wouldnt close at all leaving blades exposed. Blades are not secure in the handles, they shift if any pressure is applied. If you plan to use these on the regular; save yourself the headache and spend $20.00 on the brand name set."
2,They sent me a USED ITEM,"Don't order this set from ""Hobby Tool Supply"" because they will sell you a used set and broken box. I don;t want to return because I will have to pay for shipment. I don;t expect the knives are perfect, but at least they could have sent me a new one."
1,Exacto knife,"the blade is very weak, easy to break, sometimes you can find the same product from your local 99 cents store."
3,Certainly plenty of blades...,"This is a good kit, and has more blades than one might ever need. However, upon opening the package the entire case fell apart. As one reviewer stated, super glue is a good thing."
2,"Blades are sharp but other than that, kind of a rip off","This one is just perplexing to me. I got the knife set today and, well, it is in pretty bad condition. The box is totally non-functional -- busted. Some of the blades are dirty and rusty. It is just weird. If I didn't know better, I'd say these are definitely used and/or repackaged.See the picture I uploaded.But, the blades edges themselves seem sharp enough. And for less than $5.00, I suppose it'll due."
3,"Works...Quality, eh",Gunna lay it out simple.ITS NOT X-ACTO ITS CHEAP QUALITY!The metal was all stained and the box is stupid.Overall the knifes were sharp and did do the cutting.I have found no problems besides the quality and for the price its almost worth it.I give this a 3 stars only for the cheap quality of the set....**WANT GOOD QUALITY? DONT BUY THIS**JUST WANT TO CUT? THEN GO AHEAD THIS IS IT
1,"safety issue, DO NOT BUY","horrible and cheap, the latch doesn't close on THIS BOX OF SHARPENED SEMI LOOSE BLADES. DANGEROUS AND STUPIDI will update this review if the seller contacts me back or offers a solution, if there is no update assume they didn't offer a solution."
3,Reasonable,"Nothing special, but gets the job done. I could see where a better set may be nicer, but the chucks hold the blades firm. Provide a non-slip grip, and come with a good variety of blades. It'll get the job done and without the associated cost of the x-acto brand."
4,Decent for the price,"Like everyone has said, it's a cheap kit. I got another kit with better handles, but this has good back up blades. The handles are cheap and I wouldn't use them, but the blades appear to be held in place well. They're not very comfortable to hold after a while, but will get the job done. Blades are nice and sharp which I have tested a little. My case closes and stays shut, which is a plus. Magnetic strip on the inside holds the spare blades to the top very well. It's a great value if you only plan to use them every now and then."
4,"Useful, designed with a real purpose in mind","Comes with a variety of useful bits, all very sharp and easy to work with. They fit into the handles easily and were able to handle simple cuts with ease.Case was a little disappointing. Seems that was where the lack of care and thought into creating a quality product. The plastic is heavy enough, but the clip is very hard to close and you feel as if you may break the box shutting it. The magnet inside for the bits is a real nice touch, and each blade has a template to fit in to keep from moving around. This is adequate but not the best use since some of the templates do not exactly contour to each bit. Overall, nice buy, and already paid for itself."
3,they came already rusting,the case was broken and the knives were sharp but there easily tarnished; it those look like the picture but a bit disappointed with the presentation
3,Satisfactory,"It is a good set of knives for the price but if you plan on doing any thing that is small, detailed, or needs to be exact I recommend getting nicer blades or splurging for the better set altogether."
4,It is a decent value,"I find the SE line of products to be for the most part a good buy for things coming from the east. This was part of a few items I put in a tool box XMAS gift, I was told if you give a tool box somethings should be in it. The reason behind this is to encourage the person to buy more tools so they won't have to ask others to borrow.Over the year it has worked more often than not.This has not been actually proven, but I think it has worked."
2,"poor quality box, blades","I knew this would be low quality given its cost, but the box hinges were broken, the plastic is brittle, and the blades lack any strength and become burr-inflicted when shaving plastic."
2,Terrible knives. Rusted when received. Break easily.,"I do NOT recommend buying these knives unless you want to buy some throw-away knives for one-time use.When I received them, they were already rusted. Yes, seriously. With only slight pressure, almost all of the blades will break immediately. The handles also don't tighten enough to actually hold the blades, and so you constantly have to re-tighten them. At risk of getting sliced with a rusty blade, I recommend you look elsewhere.The only good thing about these knives is the price. But, you really get what you pay for."
3,"basically, what everyone says is true.","just got my product in the mail yesterday (free 2-day shipping with amazon prime trial? can't beat it). basically, what everyone says about the case is true. MY case was broken before i even got to open the package. the top piece was clearly separated from the bottom IN THE PACKAGE, but oh well. i didn't buy the product for the case so c'est la vie. it's being held together with a rubber band so i really don't care about it not being attached. it holds it just the same.i'm giving this product a 3 based on 3 factors:1) i haven't even used the knives yet (but i AM quite excited for it).2) there was a small amount of rust on one of the blades. but i mean, you get what you pay for.3) the case broke before i even touched it.overall, not a bad product."
3,Worth what I paid for it,"The Good:Item is as described and for the price the blades are ok. There are plenty of replacement blades in the box.The Bad:The handles feel cheap and are very light, they don't have a good ""feel"" in the hand. The blades are not very strong and bend when cutting plastic sprue.Overall:You get what you pay for and these are worth every penny, but not a penny more."
3,Good for the money,"The case isn't great, (the blades don't fit exactly) but it's good for the money!!"
5,good set of blades,"I've used exacto knifes for a long time, and this is the best set I've had. It's cool to have so many different kinds of blades to choose from."
1,Unable to hold blade,"I was not very happy with this set. The blades would not stay screwed into the one of the handles and kept falling out; the screw part of the blade wouldn't tighten all the way, so it was unreliable."
2,Meh,I needed something small and varied for some side projects. this product fit the bill for blade variations quite well. the case leaves a bit to be desired. The magnet that hold the spare blades is a little weak. Two of the blades had rust on them.
3,"SE Knife Set, 16Pc Hobby","The price was good on this set. I used it for one project and it worked well. I would not recommend it for a serious crafter. However, it met my needs."
3,You get what you pay for,"Upon opening the package, I attempted to close the case but the hinges broke right off. The case is made of extremely cheap plastic and there are clearly deformities along the edges. Whatever, I'm just kinda disappointed that it broke within 1 minute of trying to close the case. The blades are what you expect, just OK quality."
3,Get what you pay for,Cheap little set that is not too bad. Good selection of blades for a variety of uses. Blades are a bit flimsy though so be careful about them snapping and flying.
2,CHEAOER,"I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE AT A DOLLAR STORE FOR $1.00. THE CASE IS CHEAP MADE, IT WONT CLOSE RIGHT AND EASY BREAK THE BLADE SOME HAD RUST BUT IM HAPPY I PAY 1.00, I ALSO GOT A SINGLE HUBBY KNIFE FROM HOMEDEPOT THAT IS BTHE STORE U CAN GET 6 GOOD BRUSH WOOD NOT THAT CHEAP PLASTIC FOR 1.00 ALL DIFFERENT SIZE IN THE SAME BAG AND STORE.."
1,Meh.,"I was upset at the condition of this item, it looked like it had been already used and some of the blades were rusty."
2,Cheap. CHEAP. cheap.... did I mention they're CHEAP??!?,"Seriously I wanted a little hobby knife exacto blade kit for relatively inexpensive. You're better off spending an extra $5 or $10 to get a more decent set. When this arrived, the box it was shipped in was undamaged, and the packaging it was in was undamaged, but the blue case was already cracked in a few places. It doesn't even stay close because the hinges are the part that was broken when it arrived. The ""magnet strip"" doesn't hold but HALF of the blades on it. The handles are cheap and EASILY strip if you over tighten the blade in it even SLIGHTLY.I needed it for one purpose and I was able to do what I needed with it, so that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1. But seriously, if I could go back, I'd spend a few extra bucks since I doubt I'll be able to use this for anything else ever again."
2,Cheap quality...not appropriate for gifting!,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift/stocking stuffer for a model car/plane/boat enthusiast on my gift list. I was torn between this item and the name brand Xacto knife kit, which cost more but looked very similar. Convinced that if I bought the Xacto knife kit, I'd be most likely paying more money for the name, I opted to purchase this cheaper kit instead. Well, the quality is definitely cheap! You can tell it just by looking at it! I only paid $4.95 for the kit...it will serve the purpose...however, in my opinion, it is NOT appropriate quality for gift-giving! Classic lesson...you get what you pay for."
3,Stuff like this could give experimental fiction a good name,"This novel is pretty scary, and not for the faint of heart. There are some terrifying moments, and some things that are incredibly sad, but overall it was - well, let's just say this book could never be mistaken for any other book. A bizarre combination of flavors and styles that really does, somehow, sum up many of the horrors of the twentieth century. Like W. G. Sebald mixed with equal parts Charles Frazier and Cormac McCarthy, or Bourbon mixed with Coca-Cola and chased with Slivovitz, this book could really mess with your head.In a good way."
1,Overrated,"The judge of the series noted that this book was the best FIRST book of poetry he's read in several years. In my opinion, the material in this book is derivative, and the judge's comments only reinforce my view on the state of poetry in america in general...i.e. [its bad].Can't compare to any of the greats: Pound, Bishop, cummings. Save your $$ and buy something from someone who can actually write...instead of buying the ""best first book of poetry"" some hayseed has read.I would rate it 0 stars but amazon.com doesn't give us that option."
3,"Some nice music, but starts running out of gas during the second half","First let me state that this review is based on an original 1991 tape copy that I have of this, and it does not contain the 4 bonus tracks shown on the playlist that is on the product page.It is reported that Michael Sterling created every vocal and instrumental facet of this album by himself, which is, in itself, quite a ""sterling"" achievement. It starts out with the gorgeous slow jams ""My Place"" and ""Xmas Love"". Following these, however, most of the rest of the album degenerates into a mess of minimally melodic new-jack swing in which it seems that he's started seeing the rushes."
4,spotting Scope,"I needed more room in my bulleye shooter's gun box. I use it for 25 and 50 yard pistol matches. The optics are clear for these ranges and the size and weight is perfect for this use. It comes with a tripod and aluminum case for which I have no use. Price is good but could be better if tripod and case were separate. I believe this scope would be clear enough for 100 yard rifle shooters, but the 50mm objective would probably not work well for longer range rifle shooting. The most important feature is size, weight, and optics clarity for a good price."
4,great scope for the price,"I purchased this primarily for its size. I wanted a small scope that would fit in my range bag, and the collapsible feature struck me as being a great feature.Yup...it's made of plastic.And no, I wouldn't use it in a driving rainstorm.And I own a pair of Nikon Monarch bino's...its optics aren't as crisp, but it was 1/3 the price.But it's optics easily allow me to see my hits (.22) at 100yds, which was difficult with the 8x of the Monarchs, and after two years of near weekly use it functions as good as the day I purchased it.The nice hard case is a waste to some. Most, like me buy this scope for its size...why buy a collapsible scope to carry it around in a large hard case.But my 8 year old uses it to carry around all his Halo figures...so what the heck...I'm not complaining."
3,"Instructions, what instructions","I bought this as a gift for someone who is not mechanically inclined. There were no instructions, no manual, nothing to help her figure out how anything worked. Even I had trouble with the tripod - an interesting design but not one that was easily figured out and I didn't want to break it."
2,Would be great if it didn't have aberration,"I'll start by saying I like how compact it is. However, the very small tripod provided is not very stable. And worse, the optics have aberration and cannot be focused into a nice, sharp image. Of course, you buy a spotting scope in order to see your target CLEARLY, so this is a big MINUS."
3,Not Very Well Written,"As a big fan of L.M. Montgomery's books I looked forward to reading a book about her life hoping to get a better idea of what she might have been like. Perhaps it was the author's style of writing..lots of silly quotes about birds, trees, etc. Also very little about her family other than her husband's melancholy but hardly anything about her two sons. I hope the next bio will have more substance."
3,wire,"good wire for my boat radio with plenty of wire left over. hopefully it will last over time, but looks durable."
4,Heavy Gauge Speaker Wire,This wire is the right gauge and is easy to cut to the length you need. You can cut the outer insulation with a hand cutter to attach it to the speaker and CD playerphilboatbike
1,Terrible,They spent more on the plastic covering the wire than the actual wire. This is not really 18 guage wire in my opinion
2,Mediocre...,... not as good as his Airus Christmas albums. But that's my opinion. You may like it. Listen to the music samples.
4,Interesting Episode!!,Great epidose! Finally we are going to know the truth. I have followed this series since Season 1. The characters have come a long way. Some have grown up and some will never change like Pope. The introduction of new characters are great and right on time. It was getting a little boring with some of the same old characters. This season started off slow but has picked up a bit with the Season Finale approaching no telling what's going to happen. Looking foward to the Finale.
3,"Good writing, acting, but Jeez, the Production Values","OK, I'm enjoying this series because it has all the stuff that really matters: decent writing, good acting. But they really need to work harder at concealing the fact that they're a shoestring production. I mean, it's just just too darn obvious that the Medical Bus is actually a set, with the next vehicle in the convoy just a static backdrop (even when the convey's in motion!). And a few clever camera angles would have made that crowdless crowd scene a lot less pathetic."
4,Great series!,Great series! Same as many of the end-o-world concepts but the relationships between people and the plot spins are good enough to keep me guessing.
3,Very good.,As good as the first season. Holds your attention. Great special effects. Can't wait to see Season 3 when free.
2,filler episode.,"what a disgusting filler episode. its only season 2 and you're already doing repeats of stuff that happened in season 1. please explain to me, why these people need to take in a new sleeper agent harnessed kid that attracts attention by the ""skidders"" every episode? Come up with some new ideas, this series can go anywhere and you're releasing this redundant crap."
3,"Good story, Moved slowly in sections!","The story is compelling and the action scenes are solid. Dramatic portions sometimes moved too slowly. It they bring a Season 3, I'll be sure to view it.Thanks,Ron"
4,Looking forward to season three on here,Fun scifi drama with alien shooting. I like Noah more in this than some other Library related mini-series. two words
4,Great Series!,Love the series if only it would stream as well as the competition when we watch it! Lately it is super hard to get Amazon video to play!
5,Best Sci-Fi Series,This is an excellent series to bed offered on Amazon Prime. We watched every episode with great antisipation for the next show. I hope there will be a season three. Amazon Prime is a great deal and this series makes it worth the extra money besides alll the other great offerings. Plus you get free two day shipping on Amazon orders.......great deal....keep it up Amazon!
2,Great ending for a show,"Quite frankly, unless these new Super Aliens are there to help, the last scene with the whole crew standing in a crowd, rifles and pitchforks at the ready and in a perfect position to be wiped out in one large explosion, would have been a satisfactory ending for the series. I don't know if i'll continue to follow for a 3rd. The confrontation at the end, with the rebels coming to the rescue, was pretty well done."
4,Excellent story,This is interesting and was well worth the time and money .My son & I are wating for the next season to be sold.
1,Rip Off...,I'd love to see that money put back in my account. This is ridiculous. How can Amazon have the nerve to charge for a trailer? Adios Amazon hello Netflix :P
1,Charging for this is wrong and I demand the charge be removed,Amazon charged us for this when we have season passes. That's just wrong and looks like a money grab from loyal customers. Remove this charge from my account.
1,Don't buy a season pass,"Don't buy a season pass, it won't save you money because amazon will charge you for the season 2 recap, which is ""free"" and only 2 minutes long.Not sure how/if I can get a refund, because customer service is non existent here."
4,Major episode,"A little more drama, a little less Pow-Pow!, but this was well placed. I am emotionally invested enough in the characters to care about them at this point, and this episode introduced some major plot twists/advances. I had been thinking the series was a bit corney but this one showed me that it was indeed working well. :)"
5,Favorite Show,"My wife and I watch ""Falling Skies"" without fail. Since, we cancelled cable cable we stream it from Amazon.com. Beats paying a cable bill!"
5,Will watch the regular season now,"This show surprisingly was interesting and good. Never followed it during the regular season, but will now. Good characters and storyline."
3,Good but needs a bit of work,"I do like the show. I am always into the apocalyptic type of show or book. Where I sometimes have issues is when things happen and they don't make sense or when someone does something that you know would never happen. I just hope they tighten that up a little bit. It's Science Fiction but the rules of human nature should still apply. Too much poetic license and you begin to lose me because I don't believe your story anymore. But again, the actors do a great job and the show is pretty good. Oh, one last thing. They need to ease up on the Canadian accents. I love Canadians but that also takes away from the story. I mean they're from Boston and the son has a big Canadian accent. It's just a little distracting."
2,Amazon Prime delivery bottleneck is frustrating,"First let me say that we enjoyed the show, we were glad to find these reruns online as the on-demand timed out. Our DVR had a problem and recorded choppy video which was unwatchable. So, big points for coming through with the rest of the season. Looking forward to the new season when it comes out.Having said that, we've been Very Disappointed with the reliability of Amazon Prime streaming video. This includes TV shows and movies. Most of the time the service informs us that we have insufficient bandwidth which is demonstrably untrue. On more than one occasion we have switched to [competing video streaming service], sometimes for the same exact show, and had no problems at comparable video resolution. So there is something about Amazon's video delivery that is creating a delivery bottleneck. We sometimes give up because we're spending our evening watching slow orange circle clock icons. Frustrating."
4,Excellent,I enjoyed each episode. Looking forward to the next season. The plots were good and well written. Very good series.
4,Great tv show,"Really good story line on how we had to take back the planet,the main chars was strong will and made you believe in them,it keep you thing from show to show it is the best tv show to date"
4,Falling Skies Season was great,"Liked it alot, several part that had major plot changes were easy to figure out. But I did like & would tell other to watcu it."
4,Season 2,"Just as I was getting to the last shows, the scenes kept shutting down. But getting through that, the series was good."
4,Really good sic-fi series,"The acting isn't great but the beauty of Falling Skies is that the writers and producers are able to carry the actors through, with a plot that draws you in. The special effects are what you would expect for a television show. This is an original sic-fi series that will go places, even after the series end. It reminds me of a soap opera. The poor acting from most, but not all, makes you want to laugh at times but the suspense and cliff hanger endings keep you coming back for more. 4 out of 5 stars, 1 star lost for poor casting."
1,huh,"I know its just repeating the same thing, but I just don't have the patience for companies like this anymore. First N*tflix and now Amaz*n, and H*lu, and... It's cheaper to just get a DVR and pay dumb prices for satellite or cable. Amaz*n, Spamazon. I feel better, keep the two dollars, see ya."
1,i can't believe this!,"I saw that I got charged for a new episode and was excited to see it since it's been forever since the last episode aired. It is a recap. Um......Why was I charged for this? I better not get charged for the actual next episode or I WILL be sending a complaint. I mean if they're not going to bother with releasing new episodes until the Olympics are over, I understand that, but to charge me for a 2 minute recap, that's not even a full 2 minutes is some bull$*%@!!!!"
1,What a Fing rip,"Talk about trash, I waited all day before watching this since hell's kitchen had no new episode. So now im ready to watch and what its only 2 minuts. God dam it."
1,"Blatant ripoff, or error in the season pass system?",Yeah I just sent them an email regarding this. I presume that it's just an error in how the season passes bill. In any case I've given them the benefit of the doubt and asked for me shekels back.
1,Snooze Patrol,I really enjoyed most of the season but this particular show is filled with snoozy soap-opera-type scenes and lots of boring dialogue.
2,Expect more from a cast like this,"Storyline has potential. Not sure if it's the director or the actors, but somebody needs to convey what real acting is. The acting is on par with some cheesy b-movie. For some reason I can't stop watching, but I regret it every time I do."
4,"""Red Dawn"" - with aliens","Really enjoyed this series, some episodes can be kind of slow and feel like ""filler"" .. However, we stuck with it and pushed through and it turns out overall to be an extremely compelling, well written, fun and fascinating look at what may be possible if an alien race came to enslave the human kind. I highly recommend this series for people who like ""red dawn"" type shows."
3,passes the time,"Decent show. More drama about how people relate to each other than actual problems with aliens. Like Walking Dead, but not quite as good."
5,Season 2 Falling Skies,"I was so glad to see that I was able to watch the 2nd season here on Amazon Prime.I am soooooo hooked on this now.And I cannot wait to see the 3rd season now!I love love love it!!!!!Guess I am a ""freak"" after all for this sort of thing."
4,"Good Story, Nice Season ending cliffhanger.",I recommend this to sci-fi fans. I liked Battlestar Gallactica and I like this. It is a little much as times but overall I like it and as in the title of this review I can't wait for season 3 because of the season finale cliffhanger.
3,Seems like Season 2 is already slightly better than Season 1.,"Hopefully it will continue to improve. The acting has actually been a little bit better this season. I guess several people had time to improve their craft. The special effects are just as good and more of them now. It also helps that the music is better. They've also had time to develop more sexual tension between the characters. The story seems to progress now with different plot points opening up. Overall, I'll continue to watch this season to see where they take it."
5,Locked & Loaded,"From the first scene of season one up untill the suspense of the final scene of season two, I absolutely enjoyed the hell outta this series !!! The characters invite you effortlessly to live the moment of excitement and commiserate with their every setback. The princilple actors are perfectly cast as are all the ""extras"" ( hate that term but you know what i mean ). Well paced and riveting was this series and a must see for the sci-fi and action enthusiast alike. My compliments to those who made this series come to life, you relieved my obligtion in reality for a while...kudos to you all !!! carry on."
3,"Entertains, just not spectacular!","I would have honestly expected to see this on SYFY channel. At times it gets a little boring, but I love this particular genre of television."
5,Love this show!,"I love this show! Action, aliens, suspense, love of family and friends, and two people falling in love under extreme circumstances. Falling Skies is one of the best written, produced and acted shows that I have seen in a long time. I somehow missed part 1 of season 2 premiere on my dvr. So glad I could watch it on my Kindle Fire. I also downloaded the season 1 recap and season 2 preview. Great way to spend my time during a 4 hour flight. Must see TV!!"
4,Can Tom be Trusted?,Tom is having a hard time adjusting to life back with The 2nd Mass. He is afraid of what he might do as parts of his time with The Aliens are missing. Afraid of what he might do he begs to be tied up while the 2nd Mass moves.But when a Skitter and Mech attack threatens the group he steps up to fight. Pope seeing a chance to rid the group of a threat blows a bridge with Tom still on it.In the aftermath Hal attacks Pope looking for blood until Tom emerges from the river unscathed.
4,A great sci-fi experience.,"A well done made for television science fiction experience. Good special effects, a good story and good acting. I recommend it!"
5,Great,"It's like walking dead with aliens instead of zombies, nice post apocalyptic world. They keep you on your toes and can't wait to see next season."
5,Good Sci-Fi show!,"It's about time there was a worthy new show to watch! Well as far as science fiction goes anyway. Kind of reminds me of the Walking Dead in that it feels like you can lose it all at any minute. You don't know what's going to happen next. I think the characters are pretty good, as long as they stay ""semi"" believable and do not start going off the deep end. This kind of writing can be somewhat fragile if care is not taken, but so far they're doing a very good job of knowing how far to go. Top of the line? Well maybe not top, but pretty darn close. Watch it, you'll be entertained."
4,Interesting series,"Recommended to others that like sci-fi tv shows. Good interactions between characters with good fighting scenes. Little drama, but enough to keep it interesting."
4,Show,"This show is amaizing, And enjoy a LOG with my family And friends.The drama is grieta And efectos ni e too"
5,"""One of the best shows on TV right now.""",Started watching and couldn't stop until I finished all seasons available on Amazon. Patiently waiting for the new season to start!!
3,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.........,"Pretty typical and not really a lot of imagination as I would expect, from a Sci-Fi show. I guess I was just expecting more."
2,Falling Skies to Failing Skies,"This series started off decently enough, but as it has gone on, it has, in my opinion, become less and less believable. It seems to me that any advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel wouldn't mess around with bombs and lasers. If they really wanted to exterminate the native species, they most likely would have used some kind of genetically engineered bio-weapon that would have a near 100% kill rate. Also, some of the episodes have become more and more like a soap with the various on and off again relationships.I have noticed that this series has been renewed for a third season to air in the summer of 2013. I am not sure that I will waste the time on in next summer."
2,Soap Opera,"When Falling Skies went from a story about an alien invasion to a relationship drama I fell off the wagon hard. The sad thing is I'm not terribly picky when it comes to sci fi, but the show has to be more sci fi than soap opera."
3,Enough with the hugging and kissing,"The trail of good episodes ended when everybody decided to be kissy face and the internal conflicts between Tom and the CAPT disappeared in all this hail fellow well met stuff. The CAPT certainly overcame all of his demons, but that was what made him interesting, a kind of Ahab in the lead with Tom as counter with a conscience. Now they're all so busy agreeing with each other it's getting boring. We need some inner conflict, or this just winds up, as they said in Aliens (1986), as just a ""bug hunt."""
3,Great Series...in HD,I love this show. It ranks as one of my all time favorite series. It is kinds of pointless to watch it for me though unless it's in HD.
4,The Cart before the Horse,"I do enjoy this series and take it with a grain of salt. I find it funny that they want to set up a bureaucracy or government if you prefer; when they haven't even finished fighting the war. And with all due respect to the fears of a military government, right at this time it should be only military. You can see far to many people walking around who are capable of fighting the war and instead they are walking around in a daze waiting to be told when to panic. The military leaders need to take a Hienlen Starship Trooper approach to there base of operations. Everyone Fights! Believe it or not I like the show just some things bug me. I didn't know till now that season 2 was only 10 episodes? Can't we at least get 13. well it was worth the price of the season pass."
3,Dark ... no really dark,"As I like the story line of Falling Skies this one ""Death March"" was disappointing. Some of the scenes were so dark you could not tell where and what was going on. If the director was trying to convey the darkness of the times he went to far. And I know some of the scenes were at night but the viewer should still be able to see the action."
3,Enough already,"Every episode, the whiney little kid is complaining about something. And every episode, there's at least one dramatic goodbye scene where the dad and son(s) argue about who goes on the mission and how they may never see each other again and how they all love each other very much. Give it a rest."
3,Starting to Like It,I believe the story moves very slowly. I don't believe it gives enough credit to anticipation as it could but it is getting better with time. I will continue to watch it hoping for thrilling cliff hanging ends or just something to make me anticipate the next episode.
5,"As good as ""Jericho""","I am a hardcore sci-fi fan and this is high praise for this show! Jericho was by far the best post-apocalyptic show until this show. In some ways, FS is better because it answers questions that Jericho did not. There were many unknowns in Jericho that could irritate some people but the interpersonal dynamics of the show redeemed it. Falling Skies has incredible relationships, deeply defined characters, action, aliens, & even a little romance. The story moves quickly and doesn't linger in oblivion a la ""Lost."" Mysteries come up and are resolved! It has good CG aliens and the battles are frequent but not prolonged. This is a deeply satisfying show."
3,nothing happens...,"like I said, nothing happens. This whole episode is pretty much about peoples relationship with each other, this boy meets this girl, the other boy meets the other girl, bla bla... I cant believe I paid $3 for an HD version. Reminds me of Battlestar galactica, you're in space (you know interesting) yet the show is more about relationships... Jesus Christ. But anyway, I still have hopes for this show, I love some of the characters, and I love the guns they use, although they could try to be more realistic when they shoot. Also a silenced shotgun??? WTH? come on now.. and a Barrett .50 Cal at 20 yards? ( whos the guy who was assigned to the weapons department of this show??) have you not researched about these weapons?, Silenced 12 gauge?? and shooting a 1 mile sniper rifle at 20 yards?? kind of takes away from the coolness factor??? NO?"
1,Serious Rip-Off,I should have checked the reviews first. This two-minute commercial cost me $1.99 even though it said it was free. What kind of bogus crap is that?
1,Why did I get charged for this?,"Its a 2 minute recap that in the description says is free. I've seen all the episodes up until now, I don't need a recap."
1,Trailer jack w/ dolly wheel,I am disappointed with this product.The snap ring popped off and dropped my boat in the street.
5,Berlioz-Liszt and Howard: We couldn't wish for more,"This fifth volume of 95-CD traversal featuring the complete piano music of Liszt finds Howard at his very best. A truly spectacular album, rightly awarded (1991) with the most prestigious Liszt Academy Grand Prix and a superb triumph for Howard's magisterial, incomparable pianism. What else: just go out and buy it !"
3,Black/Chrome Toothbrush Holder,It looks nice but I totally missed that it couldn't hold my toothpaste comfortably. It didn't look as good when I placed toothpaste in it. Never mind. My bad.
5,Vendor pursues completion of order,The vendor hustled to complete my order and went so far as to contactme to reassure it was to be delivered at soon as possible.
3,2 Nice Rare B-Sides,"Since apparently everyone with a CD player seemed to be issued a copy of ""The Rising"" in the mail, the reason collectors would want to buy this is for the 2 Bonus tracks. First is the live ""Spirit In The Night"" from Barcelona. This is just a solo performance by Springsteen at the piano, not with the full E Street Band, but it's a very nice version of the song (and it's quite funny when Bruce realizes he's messing up one of the verses). The other live track is ""The Rising"" from MTV's VMA awards, which is not all that different from the album track, except that the performance seems to drag.This is a nice bonus for completists to have, but definitely not essential Springsteen."
1,Not molded correctly,"I bought Husky Liners for my 2012 Nissan Frontier Crew Cab. They appear to have been molded for an older model or something because they don't fit. Example is the ""pedal"" on the left side of the drivers side. It creates a big lump under the mat which does not accomodate that. The mat is molded for a flat space. Perhaps the mats were molded for a manual transmission? Not sure. But they just don't fit well."
2,A poor book at a rich price.,"I own many econometrics books and this is by and large the worst I had (I sold it at once after the course I HAD to buy it for, while I kept all others). It seems it covers everything while, in fact, almost all results are just presented rather than analyzed, let alone analyzed in depth. The best thing about the book is probably the table of contents, as one gets an overall idea of what econometrics deals with today. In fact, no other book aims at covering so much. Otherwise, it looks, feels and performs like an undergraduate text ...On top of that, this edition in particular is especially bad: the blue ink stains your hands, and there are MORE typos than in the previous one. If you absolutely want to get it, buy the third edition (if you find one used).If you want more serious general econometrics, have a look at Davidson and MacKinnon's book. If you want asymptotic theory, get White's. For time series, Hamilton's or Brockwell and Davis'."
3,About the 4th ed.:,"I've just bought the 4th edition. At my first glance it differs not much from the 3rd one, except: [1] a CD-ROM is attached; [2] typos have been corrected; [3] the WHOLE content is blue-printed instead of dark-printed, which I find uncomfortable (not used to) in reading it.The rest is similar to its 3rd edition -- poor in organization, as I mentioned before. In my professor's and my views, its 2nd edition is much better."
4,A good starting point.,"Greene's book provides a good starting point for graduate-level econometrics. The book is really comprehensive, including all major subjects of modern econometrics. The only problem I have is most references in the book are a bit out-of-date. Since econometric techniques evolve so fast, the author should include more recent journal articles instead of those written in 1970s or 1980s. Most examples in the book are also very old (1930s, 40s, etc.) In addition, I would prefer more applications in finance instead of boring consumption/production/labour economy stuff, but others may not agree. The last point is just my personal preference."
2,A reference book more than a textbook,"For some obscure reason most PhD in Econ use this book. It doesnt really explain econometrics, it just shows results. Skips more steps that are presented. With better books in the market it makes you wonder why so many schools use it. Then again this review is sort of useless, you probably MUST buy this book for a course. If that's not the case, look elsewhere..."
5,The quintessential econometrics text,"There is no other book that even comes close to Greene's masterpiece. It contains a plethora of information that makes this book not only a wonderful text but also a wonderful reference as well. Filled with matrix-based analysis, a good section on asymptotics, and plenty of real-world examples. This book is a must have for grad students in Economics."
2,not what was promised by the seller,"The book was advertised with CD, i received no CD in it. When i contacted abebook, they send me e-mail that i have to complain to amazon."
3,London Live Has Hits and Misses,"By the time of this album, London was in her late-thirties and while still glamorous, the breathy, come-hither voice that propelled her to stardom in the 1950s was wearing thin. Was she still playing the sultry siren or was her voice feeling the strains of age? This is an uneven outing, but London does a superb Blackbird with only a bass accompaniment. The frenetic Trolley Song and Gotta Move are so-so as they find London overshadowed by a male chorus. But she regains her footing on By Myself and My Baby Just Cares for Me. This is not the disc to buy as your introduction to London. Total time is 37 minutes."
4,Very dependable,"Could be designed a little better so the numbers can be seen from all angles. Otherwise, a wonderful clock."
4,Stark Raving Elvis,"A fun, witty book about an impersonator who gets ""caught in a trap""--just like his idol. A lot of fun whether you're an Elvis fan or not (and I don't know which would find it funnier)."
2,They are Usable.,"About 33% of the ends of these pencils are cracked but sharpen OK when you get past the bad part. Almost 20% have a cracked knot near the middle. When you get to that part, if the pencil hasn't already broken; trying to sharpen it will most likely break the lead. One of the first 12 had no lead and was of no use. As they are not quite standard size in width they have to be forced into the sharpener. Most will work, but it's not a very good deal."
5,Exactly What Was Wanted,My friend was frustrated by the carpenter's pencils available in stores. He asked me to find the best carpenter's pencils online. He was thrilled with the Keson Pencils. They are strong and easy to grasp. Just what he was looking for.Keson CP12 72-pack Industrial-Grade Carpenter Pencils with Flat Lead
3,kenson pencil,these pencils are a good deal for the price the only thing i dont like is the lead is weak and it breaks easily when sharpening other than that its a good deal
4,Carpenter Pencils,"These are great carpenter pencils. If you're not familiar with the type, they are relatively wide pencils with two flat sides. When you set one down, even on a slanted board, it does not roll away!These pencils do not fit in standard pencil sharpeners and are usually sharpened the old-fashioned way - by whittling at the end with a pocket knife. A very nice point can also be achieved by using sand paper.In addition to being valuable for marking boards for sawing, they make good art pencils - I use mine for sketching more often than for carpentry."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A covert organisation puts together a superhuman strikeforce by empowering and training a group of youths. They keep them keen by allowing them a rockstar lifestyle, even if closely watched.The missions they are ordered to undertake do eventually lead them to ask questions, especially when bad things happen to more than one of their number."
1,Dickies Steel Toe Oxfords,"Do not buy these shoes! They are slippery and I've fallen several times. This last time, I threw them in the trash. Save your money and buy a better shoe."
1,Just didn't work for me...,Read the synopsis... sounded like it might be entertaining... got about 30 minutes into it and decided not to invest any more of my life resources. It just didn't work for me and couldn't hold my attention...
4,bachelorman,Bachelorman was much funnier than I expected. Included in any comedy collection it will become an instant favorite. Its a bit racy for the younger set but I'd recommend it for those over 17.
3,Not as fun as the predecessor,Not as fun as the predecessor as i stated. the arcade versions allow you to select form mult ships but this one seems to be just put together for the sake for of home one on the home console.
2,THIS GAME SUCKS,"If you're a shmup fan then this game certianly isn't for you. It suffers from the worst problem any shooting game can suffer from, you constantly feel underpowered. Not as bad as Karous but on par with Homura. What's worst is that you can upgrade your guns but the upgrade usually suck worst than your defualt gun. You have a green laser and a blue laser, both of which are next to useless. If you get enough power ups you'll get some missles with the lasers but it doesn't do much good at all. Beyond that the game is extermly boring. Theres rarely any time that the screen is filled with bullets (even on the hardest setting) usually it's a boring burst that speeds through the screen.It's puzzling to me how games like Mushihimesama and ESP Galuda don't get ports over here but garbage like this does."
3,Diane McKoy,"I enjoyed hearing Diane McKoy's early work. It is not as good as her latest CD ""Ready Or Not Here I Come."" It was interesting and had some good songs."
4,Excellent audio,"The range in the city was pretty good (2 miles) even with hills in between, but I would like more. The clarity is very good, didn't notice any static on Channel 8."
2,BUY THE MIDLAND GXT650VP4 SET!,"This is an unfavorable review for two reasons:1) Brunton is significantly over charging for these handsets2) Brunton's customer service's lack of responsiveness.As far as I can tell, Midland has the exact same units selling for as much as $40 less. Brunton has made many innovative products and I assumed this was another and not just some ""me too"" product with a HUGE mark up.It is possible there is some difference I am not aware of (other than color and branding), so I emailed Brunton's customer service for justification of the big price difference. It's been eight days and I haven't even seen an automated reacknowledgment of my inquiry."
5,Great addition to our game room!,We received the dartboard much quicker than anticipated and were able to install it and play at a Super Bowl gathering that we hosted. It looks very nice on the wall and we love using it.
4,Needs to be taller,"I like the look of the canister - very retro looking, which is nice. The only drawback is that it's not tall enough to hold any long strand pasta such as spaghetti."
5,Megamorphs Back to Before or Back to the Future?,"Jake, the leader of this group of Animorphs (world savers who have yet to been defeated or have yet to won), has suddenly woken up in the future. As himself in 20 years. The Yeerks have won, all hope is lost. I can't give away to much of the book but I can tell you a few things. As promised by Katherine Applegate, the author of the book, they're will be a little romance going on between Rachel and Marco. But hey, didn't Rachel have that little 'thing' going with Tobias? Well, you will just have to read up on this. It is an extrodinarially well-written book I have seen in a while. Any Animorphs Fan would treasure this book forever!"
2,"Well, it was fun to see a little ""what if?"", but....","...I'm not too sure why KA bothered to write this. Sure, all Animorph readers have no doubt wondered about what would have happened if that group of teenagers had just kept walking that fateful night. That is exactly what we get to see in this book... sort of. Jake, depressed after an iffy battle, is given the oppurtunity to go back in time, walk past the construction site, and live life normally.The resulting story is nonetheless somewhat entertaining; indeed, a new perspective is shown. But I still found it trite, inconsistent, and just flat-out boring. We get some plot/character twists and a couple of minor chase scenes... and nothing else.Yes, it was interesting to see a what if? But now let's get back to reality."
5,This Book Rules!,This is the best Animorphs Book i have ever read! I order you to BUY THIS BOOK! BUY IT NOW! Its the best!
2,Wish it had worked for my dogs,"I have a bichon / cav king mix and a another poodle / spaniel mix. Their coats would be dry between baths with deep conditioner. So, I tried this to spritz them up between washes during the winter. I was really excited to try this product and had high hopes after reading other reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't have the same success. Perhaps it's more ""coat specific"" according to breed and hair structure? Worth the try though if it works for your breeds."
4,This is the only to heat WPA,"It was in my 2nd year of university and I was dragged along by a friend to see a pub band i had only heard of through a single song and did not really think much of. Much to my surprise it was possibly the best concert experience i have ever had. I have been totally hooked on the band since. 'They Were Better Live' sums up WPA, in that as good as their albums were, the live concerts were something else instead. This CD captures the passion and humour of a WPA concert as far as it is possible to do so without being there yourself. Plus it has all the favorites. For someone being introduced to the band for the first time I would suggest they buy Roaring Days , but after that this is a good substitute. particularly seeing WPA have since passed on."
4,"Good balance of portability, power, and features","I received the On Stage Micro as a gift after I mentioned to family members that I would like a way to listen to my iPod while I was in the shower. The unit is small enough to fit unobtrusively on my bathroom countertop, so it's a perfect way to achieve strong sound in a limited space.The unit operates with an (included) AC adapter or on AA batteries, increasing its portability and flexibility. When it's plugged in, it also charges your iPod.My single complaint about the On Stage Micro is that it doesn't hold my volume setting between uses. I turn off its power each time I'm finished using it, and the next I plug in my iPod and turn on the On Stage Micro's power, I have to adjust the volume down a bit -- the sound is full enough that in my small bathroom, the default volume level is a bit too loud. I'm not sure why the unit doesn't hold the last volume that was set, I imagine most folks would prefer a single volume setting as well."
2,This harmonica has an odd layout,"In general I like the other Chrometta harmonicas I have owned (the 8 hole model 250 and the 12 hole model 255) but the layout of this harmonica is odd. On most harmonicas (including other 10 hole chromatics I have had) the first note on the harmonica is the root note of the key of the harmonica. So, for example, if the instrument is in the key of C the first hole blow note is a C.On this instrument the first hole starts in the middle of the scale(G). This can be a problem for players like myself who are use to the conventional layout of the instrument."
2,"Not up to par,","I am a beginning harmonica player, though I have more experience with fiddle and guitar. I been learning on my diatonic for a few months and was missing the ability to play flats and sharps so freely as I do with stringed instruments, I decided to try a chromatic.This harmonica has trouble playing clear notes on the high and low end- and sometimes in the middle. They sound wobbly and are hard to produce at all regardless of air flow. It does not play a complete chromatic scale.This was not quite what I was expecting. I feel like it would be worth it to go for a higher end Hohner 64 model."
4,Every parent should read this book,"A book that provides plenty of valuable advice for parents whose Teens are heading out into the big bad world. Some of it I found a bit ""goody goody"", but it provided material for reflection that I found valuable. I recommend it"
2,Doesn't Last,I do not recommend this light. It did not last but eight weeks. There are other lights available on the market that last longer.
4,lamp for turtle,Like all fluorescent lamps when using them for turtles they just don't last very long. But it's better then some of the other brands we tried.
4,"Excellent, space-saving, alternative to larger and longer bulbs","Yes this gives good enough UVB for your friendly chelonian. This bulb can be used in standard clamp lamps that have a ceramic holster. It runs at only 28 watts so don't expect it to be a good basking lamp on it's own. It's more of a supplement to your regular incandescent. The nicest treat, I think, is that it's self ballasted; so you won't have any other expensive equipment to buy other than the clamp lamp.Anyway, the point is... If you have a setup that involves you being unable to install the larger more traditional fluorescent lamp covers and you want UVB lighting for your reptile this is an excellent alternative."
4,so far so good,"I received this item about 3 months ago and have been using it as a uvb lamp for my turtles. its on everyday for about 12 hours and my turtles love laying out under the rays. hopefully, it will last another 3 to 6 months and after that i plan on purchasing another one."
4,From the overview to the personal,"By all accounts, this is a well done book giving a good overview of the issues surrounding chronic pain as well as therapies and treatments useful for making a good adjustment to the chronically pained life.I would like to recommend my book, A PAINED LIFE, a chronic pain journey as a good adjunct to Making Peace With Chronic Pain.A Pained Life"
2,Caution: Not a very good book.,"While not the worst fencing book ever written, it is just barely above basic. The photos more often than not are just so-so (the fencers in the pictures look like rank beginners), and sometimes they are even confusing. Having been a fencer for some twenty-seven years, I would not recommend this book"
4,Great songs...but thematically mixed.,"I am a huge Sinatra fan, and while these are all great songs, i would still prefer to hear them in their original album format. The flow is more smooth from track to track. And if i had to choose only one CD, i would still pick Songs For Swingin' Lovers or Swingin' Affair over this compilation. About half the songs on this CD come from those two albums anyway.Still, there are worse compilations. At least this is SOMEWHAT thematically similar. If you really just want a sort of best of the 50's Sinatra, this is probably it. But remember, while they ARE all love songs, they are NOT all ballads. They range from intimate ballads to gentle swingers to somewhat hard swingers. This isn't a cozy-up-to-the-fire late night listening love songs CD. For that, go for Nice and Easy or Wee Small Hours....Sinatra's two best albums of love songs."
3,heartfrank,"Sinatra's familiar, smooth voice captivates the listener with the first song. Many of the songs, however, are new to this buyer and on replaying the CD they are skipped over. Unfortunately, taking time to jump over selections breaks the mood. Fewer songs would be a good option. Perhaps a listing of the songs on the disc would have helped me make a choice."
1,Dull,This has to be one of the dullest CDs I bought this month. There is a sameness to her singing that just put me to sleep
1,Bland,There is a similitude to the tracks of this recording. The songs are almost uniform in that there is no excitement in the recordings and little passion comes across in the interpretation of the lyric.
5,The best Lttle Feat recording,I have listened to all of the LF recordings and have seen them perform 3 times over a period of 15 years. What makes Time Loves a Hero special is its appeal to a broad audience. I played Day at the Dog Races during a guest DJ slot on a jazz radio station and stumped everyone. When I revealed the artist there was an initial sense of shock from the listeners but the overall response was very good.I love the Feat and wish they would record more music like Time Loves a Hero.
2,An album that hasn't aged well ...,"It's a common enough story in popular music: backing band with aspirations pushes out front man in decline. Only insiders will ever know whether Lowell George jumped or was pushed from the creative heights to which he led Little Feat in the Dixie Chicken era. This album certainly occupies a much lower place, in which, as another reviewer put it, jazz-rock noodling and synthesizers replace the ""country with a funky beat"" that (for me) defines the `real' Little Feat.By the time of this album, Little Feat was effectively two bands: one backing Lowell George's synthesis of rock, country, and funk; and another without him, dabbling in now-dated 70s-style fusion with little lasting appeal. Some people like either or both of these versions, but not me: I'd take a few cuts from this one, ignore then next two, and leave Dixie Chicken in my CD changer permanently."
3,Time loves a hero,"Time does love a hero and, not that there's much more on this disk unless you love Little Feat's quality music, for the price it's well worth it."
2,The best one !,"I think this is best album they have ever done. I`m not long time Little Feat fan but I do have all their albums. Hi Roller is great Feat rock song, Red Streamliner is good one too. Every track is good example what Feat can do at their best ! Waiting for Columbus Live 2 cd is another story then, that`s killer live album and shows what they were famous of. So Time Loves a hero is great album !"
2,Another Step Down for the Feats,"""Time Loves a Hero"" continues Little Feat's downward trajectory from the dizzying height of ""Dixie Chicken."" Lowell George is essentially gone, jazz-fusion noodling replaces funky Southern grooves, and electronically synthesized sounds smother the rich, organic timbre of real instruments. A real disappointment."
4,"A great sample of LF, with one gem","Maybe I'm crazy, but for me what what stood out on this recording (way back when I was all of 15) was not the fun, light tunes but the magnificent and underrated ""Day at the Dog Races"". It's what kept this recording in my collection long after I would have consigned it to the yard-sale pile. It's an experiment, true, in the jazz fusion that was insinuating itself into a lot of bands at the time (""look, see? We're serious musicians!"") but it stands head and shoulders above other efforts (including those on the rest of this CD) because of it's incredible energy and wicked force. It winds around in so hummable a way, with a frenetic latin beat, and has at least two musical swells of incredible power. Twenty years later, it's still the highlight of this album, and still just as good today."
4,Not Quite A Classic But Damn Good,"The bands performance actually slips a little mostly due to the fact that Lowell George's contributions lessened. The last song, where its pleasant really does only involves Paul Barrere. Somehow I would also have preferred a few more guitar driven songs. But none the less there is plenty of creativity here particularly on the instrumental A Day At The Dog Races where the band borders on free form jazz. You really can not go wrong with this band."
5,Time Loves a Hero - Little Feat,In my opinion the Best Little Feat Album ever recorded. This is a very talented band and continue to be even after the 1979 death of Lowell George. Great riffs and every song tells a story! Ear candy for the Little Feat Enthusiast
4,Fast shipping,"Movie was shipped as stated in perfect condition. Gave it as a gift, so timely delivery was important. A bit more expensive then I would have liked tho. Not much competition I guess."
3,Too much Bill,The movie was OK but there was too much about Bill W's drinking and not enough about Lois's point of view.
4,When Love is not Enough,"There was a point when I thought it drug out, but overall I really liked it. I felt the acting was good and it ended well. I do feel it should have also reflected his having affairs w/ other women. That had to have played a role in her life."
2,What was I thinking?,"I had heard a couple of short clips of them over the net and I thought they sounded pretty promising. I went out and bought this album and I was disappointed. At times the music makes no sense at all. It goes from fairly heavy riffage to like an 80's hair band feel. That's what I got out of this album, it's not worth buying..."
1,It doesn't get as UNORIGINAL as this,"bad band, bad music, these guys obviosuly have NO TALENT. not original at all."
5,The Hottest Novel of 2005,I would say Loose Cannons of Buckland County is a romping good time! This is a great book about family and reconciliation. The characters are well developed and the story line moves well. I really enjoyed the book. It took me through the whole range of emotions from laughter to tears. I'd highly recommend it!
5,Phenomenal Book,"For anyone who is a WWII historian, or amateur historian, anyone who loves church and any other type of religious buildings, for all architects and designers, for contractors and builders, for anyone who loves a great read...buy this book. What a wonderful story of the phoenix rising from the fire...following the destruction of the Coventry Cathedral during WWII."
3,good game,Good game but it gets kind of redundant after a while. Would have loved more variations on the levels.
5,good buy,"This chair is comfortable, durable, and a good buy! I highly recommend it. I like that the headrest can be slid down for lumbar support which is most comfortable for me."
3,Diluted suspense a disappointment,"Being a fan of Minette Walters, I was surprised and disappointed to find that this is a Walters book not worth reading. It begins with a bang but quickly descends into a long drawn out story with numerous sub plots about a village and its eccentric inhabitants that have nothing to do with the primary story. The ending picks up a little, but by then I found it hard to care whether, Connie, the heroine ever makes it back from her mental decline to save the day."
4,One of Minette Walters's best.,Ms. Walters keeps getting better. This book is about how victims of terror become terrorizers and vice versa. It is a close examination of what violence can do to people. The ambiguous ending is just right. One can only hope for a sequel.
4,Good story,Not one of Walter's best but a very good story and book is well written. Surprise ending but then her books always end that way.
5,GREAT WOMEN AUTHORS,"minette walters is #1 in my collection-i've not yet EVER not finished one of her books. if you've read books by walters, you'll very like LINDA LA PLANTE & VAL MCDERMID. all british authors. all great books."
1,No longer a favorite author,"I was disappointed that Ms. Walters used this fictional novel as a platform for her politics. Had the book been a better read, I may have forgiven the mistake; however, the book seemed more about Ms. Walters' political statements than about an entertaining and engaging story.Ms. Walters is entitled to her political opinions, and may vote as she likes. As for me, the next time Ms. Walters publishes a book, I will vote with my pocketbook and skip this purchase."
1,One of the worst books EVER,"I don't know how she ever got published, let alone won any awards. The average 4 year old can dictate a more compelling story.She came highly recommended, from strangers and Palahniuk alike, but I couldn't trudge through more than a few stories before wondering wtf is wrong with them.Pure doldrums with simplistic vocabulary and almost zero plot."
4,Worthy of the honor it was given,"There's a reason the New York Times named it One of the 10 Best Books of 2006.It's Hempel's voice:Pretty, in that way that only a woman's voice can be.Clear-eyed, without affectation of any kind.Deeply insightful.Compassionate.A little sad.If Emily Dickinson had been born 121 years later, she might have been Amy Hempel.She can write about anything and make it interesting.I think you'll like it."
4,"loaded, strong","I was skeptical coming from several friends' suggestions regarding her stories. I'm pleasantly surprised.Her stories are not out of ordinary, which makes them all the more 'good'. She writes about life and does it in a polished manner. At times, I wish her writing is a bit more raw but her style straddles well between literary academics and contemporary fiction specialists.Look for the last sentence in ""The Most Girl Part of You.""Look for Chuck Palahniuk."
3,A good story?-somethines,I like a good short story- more in the style of Damon Runyon or Edward Jones. Hempel's collection were what I would read for an English essay class rather then an enjoyable book of stories. I sometimes fell asleep or missed the story unless I re-read to find the necessary details. I'm still not sure I understand the story of the friend in the hospital. There were some good essays but some do not make a 5 star book. I had to work harder then I think I should with a book I am reading for enjoyment. Few stories hit a memory or made me ponder. I was honestly surprised at how many 5 star reviews she received and at how few readers were in the middle because there was not a commonality in the stories in my opinion. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I had picked it up at odd moments and read a small amount instead of reading it cover to cover. This would be my advise for future readers.
5,Wonderful short stories,"You read Hempel stories and just go-whoa- she can write. Her stories are craft, art, and just punch you in the heart. Gave her book as gifts-love her."
2,Obsolete and Incomplete,"Van Der Meulen's definitions are basic and copied from other sources. They are incomplete definitions that have been superceeded long ago by many publications. The book is, however, an interesting look into an abbreviated history of the definitions used in system safety summarized in a nice hardcover edition for reference. If only a more modern edition existed..."
4,Great ideas for living sculpture,"If you've never heard of willow sculpture, this is a great introduction. If you've ever wanted to try willow sculpture, this book will give you the basic ""how to"" knowledge and lots of ideas."
5,A Gospel Classic,"This is a re-issue of Elvis' classic ""Crying In The Chapel"" single. Oringinally released in 1965, this song was Elvis' only US top ten single between 1963's ""Bossa Nova Baby"" and 1969's ""In The Ghetto"", a welcome relief from the increasingly mediocre movie soundtracks he was recording during that period. It peeked at number 3 on the US singles chart but went to number 1 in the UK and also hit the top spot on the US Adult Contemporary chart and stayed there for 7 weeks. It would eventually be certified PLATINUM by the RIAA. This release includes the orginal 45 B-side ""I Believe In The Man In The Sky"" and an excellent bonus track ""Milky White Way"". While these songs are available on other Elvis Gospel CDs, this is a nice collector's item for avid Elvis fans."
4,Classic,"I would have little to say other than that this work is probably the most readable that i have seen and is quite useful. Color pictures and better quality photography-rendition would have been ideal, but the date of original authorship makes this unlikely, unless the work is to be revised."
4,Good read,Bought this for my history class. Great book with so much historical information to keep a class going for years! I wish the book could of had better pictures in color. Fast shipping! Gotta love Amazon Prime!
5,One of the best,"This is one of the best Royo books. It is a good mixture of everything: sketches (both plain and colored) and finished paintings; futuristic sci-fi and ancient to medieval fantasy; unhappy/worried characters and powerful/confident ones; dark/mysterious pictures and bright pictures; fully clothed and mostly nude; cover arts and independent art; men and women. Still, the works don't get as dark as, say, III Millennium. But it shows much of what Royo is capable of and I recommend it."
5,Really nice!,"After hurricane Katrina, I began rebuilding my collection of books on all types of art, including fantasy art. This is a beautiful book, and as usual, a great Amazon purchase!"
2,A little dissappointed,I received the set (book and movie) in good time but I just recently was able to watch the movie and it stopped and skipped 15 minutes in. I was tired and went to bed and have yet to have time to try cleaning it. The book was in mint condition!
4,"""She's So HEAVY!"" ~ When The World Changed Forever","I found the '07 release `Across the Universe' to be a nostalgic, enjoyable film that beautifully highlights the songs of the greatest rock/pop group of the twentieth century and beyond. The cast is thoroughly likeable, the cameos excellent, especially Bono and Joe Cocker, and the storyline and visuals pure `60's.There are numerous levels of thought and genres from which one can approach this film. It's a musical, a period piece, a cultural/political statement, a love story and a poignant coming of age tale. Remarkably it succeeds on all levels. Put on your walrus outfit and give it a try.My Rating: -4 Stars-."
5,"Great service, great products","Highly recommend for ease of ordering, speed of delivery and a product exactly as advertised."
5,Across the Universe DVD,"One of the best movies, and the best musical I've seen! Loved this. Great price."
4,Good Musical,A Very interesting rendition of the Beatles music as a musical. At least it makes sense and is Far Superior to Sergeant Peppers Musical which was lame.
2,just not enough to go with,"So, i finally watched this movie a week or so ago with my wife. I had been wanting to see it for quite a while as i heard wonderful praise from all of my friends and the reviewers. Now, i've come to the point where i have processed and thought more about what i saw. Here is the deal, i am a huge movie buff, musical theater buff, beatles fan, love julie taymor's previous works, etc. This movie, at the turn of each plot change, did not work. The cinematography is wonderful, musical arrangements pretty solid, decent singing, etc. However, the plot seemed almost non-existent; everytime another part of the story began there was yet another seperation making me not care about the characters. i think the best way to sum up my perception of this movie is that it's a lot of ""moments"". there were many wonderful moments in the movie, but nothing to sentimentaly tie them together for me. I really did want to like this movie. It's worth giving it a shot, but definitely over hyped."
3,Good promise.,"I actually went to see this movie, hoping to hate it, because I thought it was disrespectful to the Beatles, but it turned out to be interesting.Some of the song references were a little corny (i.e. the clerk saying ""well I imagine that when I'm sixty-four...."") but it made up by having a good storyline."
5,A movie for everyone.,"Let me preface this by saying that 9 times out of ten i ABHOR musicals. HATE THEM. I gave this a shot only because my boyfriend brought it home.Guess what? This is one of my favorite movies, hands-down. Ever. I was totally blown away by it. I laughed, I cried (and so did my partner - suffice it to say that after realizing he cried at movies, I fell in love - and perhaps I might be a little biased about this movie because of that). I was thoroughly impressed not just by the musical segments (yeah, truly!) but by the storyline, too.Buy it, rent it, watch it, love it."
4,for beatles fans,great beatles songs performed very close to originals lots of close hints of real beatle history abby road ending is great very relaxing way to spend a couple of hours a keeper
4,Must See for Beatles Fans,"This movie has all the earmarks of a full-on musical from yesteryear. With dancing, very convincing singing, and easy mindless plot lines, Across the Universe had me tapping my feet and singing along from the start. Notable was the singing by all the actors with Rachel Evan Wood's version of ""If I Fell"" being both poignant and captivating. The scene at the military induction center - ""She's So Heavy"" and ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun"" - was brilliant.Go back to the Love Generation of the sixties with this Beatles movie - you'll watch it again and again."
2,sappy and long,This isn't a polished review per se. Just wanted to throw in that the movie is a bit long and often sappy. My friends and I lost it during the second half and were put off by overly emphasized psychedelic scenes of the hippies getting high. It just went on and on and on....
4,A compagnon to the fab !,Modern film and good story play with new young actors ; film with connection in music with Beatles records in different way by new singers and actors from the film ; absolutely to watch. Only one regret no booklet in the special deluxe box set.
1,Across the Universe,"I wanted this movie so bad because I've seen it before. This movie came finally after 2 weeks and I was so excited. I put it in and when it got to the best part ""Strawberry Feilds"" it couldn't read the disc because it was too scratched. I was very mad."
1,Disc issues,"Unfortunately, I can't give a review for this movie. The disc will not play in my DVD player or my computer. I received one and returned it after it wouldn't play. Unfortunately, the second one has the same issue. It is not my player because I have no problem with other DVDs."
1,Turned-Off,"You want to enjoy Beatle songs? Listen to your Beatles collection. These flower children are still trying to tell us that they were right and we were wrong. I'd much rather fight for my country abroad, than fight against it at home. The mindset of the director of across the universe is pityful. To portray US soldiers, dressed like Fidel Castro! Well, you must be an embecile! Don't waste your money like I did in buying this movie. It stinks. Vietnam Vet, 1st MarDiv, 1st Shore Party Bat. 1967,68"
1,"Aging hippies, absent Beatles","A celebration of the Beatles, but without the Beatles. Instead you get some actors singing to music track. You also get the self-important arrogance of the 60s generation (take a look at the title: the ""Universe,"" you say?) and ""insight"" into the horrors of the Vietnam War comprising gay actors in period battle dress uniform splashing through water.A truly nolstagic adventure if your pushing or past 60 years of age, a recruiting poster for the GOP for Generation X, etcetera and don't forget that you cannot trust anyone over 30, over 40, over 50, over 60. Well, you get the idea."
2,horribly disapointing,"In all fairness, I was skeptical about this movie before i saw it. My girlfriend was pulling my arm into the theatre to see this film. So i gave it a shot and to be honest i felt it was way too speratic. Simply put they tried to cram too much character development into a short period, what they should have done was tone down on the backstories and make the film somewhat more linear. i didn't recognize a solid plot that progressed until midway through the movie. It was like like several smaller vignettes. All in all i disliked it"
1,Anti War Liberal Redorick,This film was awful. That is why it was an academy award nominee. Jude was cute though.
1,Plasticine movie,"Here's the short version: Take every stereotype of the Sixties and every stereotypical photographic/videographic image of the Sixties, then throw them into a blender with the Beatles catalog. What comes out? This tasteless mush of a movie.The longer version of a critique involves the fact that the creators of this so-called movie want to tug at our heart-strings with familiar images that are supposed to elicit sentimental feelings out of historical parts of our lives. Images of 'Nam are supposed to make us remember how horrible the war was. Images reminiscent of Kent State try to evoke the horrors of that tragedy. Referencing common themes of the Sixties does not make this a good movie about the Sixties. ""Across the Universe"" lacks any coherent narrative voice that makes us care about the characters in the story.And, as a side-tangent, Bono's cameo was comical in that he came across as a Robin Williams caricature of Bono."
1,couldn't wait for it to end,"I was told I would love this movie because I am a Beatles fanatic and love the 60s culture. So like so many others that were miss guided into thinking that a movie worth of being associated with the Beatles was made was sorely disappointed. The writing was terribly unoriginal, a majority of the songs were butchered to pieces and I felt absolutely no chemistry amongst the cast. I kept watching hoping for something better to happen but ended up just glad it was finally over. If you love the Beatles and find yourself in Vegas go see Love because that was one of the greatest shows have every seen before."
1,Not compatible with portable device,"This movie is INCOMPATIBLE with my Sony NWZ-S545 Walkman, even though Amazon claims otherwise. Beware if you are purchasing movies for use on a portable device. I had previously purchased another Amazon movie which worked fine on the same device. This means that Amazon is unreliable and I won't be buying digital movies from them again."
1,Hated it,"My 13 year old daughter loved it. I hated it. Go figure. I REALLY hope she doesn't expect me to sit through it again. Loved the music of course, but did not understand the point of the movie at all. Where was the plot?"
5,I was there,I saw the Beetles at Olympia Arena in Detroit.I got my draft notice in 1966 while in basic training.I was in Detroit during the Riots.I remember funeral detail.I remember what I was doing when I learned that Dr. King was killed.This film is amazing.It's not just the music or coriography.The film captures my generation.This is what it was like to be a flower child.This is the essence of the 60's.
2,The Beatles Lite,"I must admit that I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than I thought I would, but the second half was like Moulin Rouge all over again. It just went crazy on me. The songs weren't sung or performed that well and left me wishing to hear the original versions instead. The plot also didn't seem to have much purpose other than a thrown together love story mixed with a little anti-war for good measure. Across the Universe seems to be a movie that most people love or hate. I didn't hate it (the visuals were nice), but I wouldn't want to sit through it again."
5,new take on the Beatles,I loved this movie so much that I've watched it 3 times and gotten all my friends to watch it and buy it too. I've downloaded the sound track to my ipod and love the new take on the Beatles songs.
5,Julie Taymor aces it,"When I saw ""Across the Universe"" on the big screen, I said to the friend I saw it with ""It's perfect."" After six more viewings in theaters and about twenty on DVD, my opinion has not changed. First, I love the Beatles' music, and Taymor lets the music tell the story. Second, the performers are recorded on set, not lipsync'd; the difference is subtle but important -- emotions are experienced directly. Third, the young actors are terrific, especially Evan Rachel Wood, whose expressions are so transparent I feel I am seeing directly into Lucy's soul -- especially the final shot, which gives new meaning to ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."" I also appreciate Taymor's use of Joe Cocker, Bono, and Eddie Izzard in cameos; they are also perfect. I am disappointed thet the film was not recognized with more nominations or awards, but I certainly hope Taymor will keep up the good work."
4,Liked it a lot.,"Good music, Good songs, Good performances, with a good cast IMHO with an entertaining presentation. I'd recommend people see it."
4,Worth an Upgrade,"As a fan of The Beatles and of musicals, I liked Across the Universe when it came out a few years ago. When I made a list of movies I should get for my new Blu-Ray player, this was at the top of the list. Why? Fantastic visuals, a solid soundtrack of Beatles covers, and colors that deserve 1080p."
5,good,I bought this as a present for a friend. She was thrilled with her gift and I am pleased with my purchase.
4,music of the beatles,"across the universe is a good story well told,with the music of the beatles as a backdrop....what more could anyone want.well done evan rachel wood"
4,!,"The plot for this movie may be razor thin, but it's definately worth seeing for the music and art direction alone. Not to mention it features a scene in which Joe Cocker sings ""Come Together"" while dressed as a pimp."
5,.......,"Firstoff I'd like to say that this movie deserves awards if it doesn't already have some, second, this movie was great, probably one of the few movies with a decent soundtrack, recommend to anyone who loves music and a good story."
5,An Astounding Achievement,"This is far and away one of the most visually creative, captivating, and mesmerizing films I've ever seen. It is intoxicating in every way, and one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. Julie Taymor's vision is astounding, the art department deserves an Oscar, and the performances are equally compelling. I loved everything about this movie. To take a collection of existing songs and create a film around them is a big challenge, but the result in this case is a film that so seamlessly incorporates the music and story with brilliantly stylized visualizations, it's nearly perfect.It's a film that speaks more to your psyche than your brain, with such searing, evocative visuals they will be in your soul long after the end credits are over. I have been going crazy waiting to purchase this since the film was released late last year."
1,This movie is painful to listen to. Steer clear of this dreck!,"This movie insults the music of The Beatles and musicals in general. This movie fails to provide even one remote reason to indulge in any of these characters. The songs are familiar but the music has been ""modernized"" to the point where it doesn't improve on anything. Xanadu at least had original songs and of course the beautiful Olivia Newton-John on roller skates. How can you beat that?? LOL. Stay away from this overhyped pile of junk. The Bono cameo is laughable at best and thankfully this movie didn't do so well in theatres so it won't ruin his career too badly!"
1,Not for Die-Hard Beatles Fans,"I am a die-hard beatles fan and I absolutely hate this movie. The songs chosen are the generic Beatles, none of the true good ones (come on, no A Day in the Life? or Sgt Peppers? or Norwegian Wood? or Back in the USSR? the list goes on and on). They throw in random Beatles songs that don't fit into the plot what-so-ever (Blackbird, Come Together, While My Guitar Gently Weeps just to name a few). Oh, but there are plenty generic Beatles songs: Hey Jude, I Want to Hold Your Hand, Something, All You Need is Love, and the list keeps on going. Don't get me wrong, those are some great songs, but the Beatles defiantly have better songs. If you are not a beatles fan or a somewhat beatles fan, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this movie. If you are a die-hard, like myself, you will not. All of my other die-hard beatles fans haven't liked it either, but those who aren't will like it. If you truly love the Beatles, don't waste your time or money."
1,"Why, God, Why?","Sweet Jesus what a lousy movie. What a pretentious, plodding, over-ripe and under-written piece of tripe. The 60s as interpreted by people who weren't there and think that a street protest montage Says It All. You know you're in trouble when you hear lines like ""My name's Jude."" ""My name is Lucy."" In the sky, with diamonds, GET IT? While I regret spending $18 on this bomb, at least I had the pleasure of shutting it off in the middle, whereas if I had paid $10 to see it in a theater, I might have felt obligated to sit through the whole mess. Nice photography, though."
1,Wished I didn't buy this one!,"I was looking for a movie that mirrored what was happening in those times. This was not that movie.Actually I found it kind of dopey, there I went and said it. Everybody has a right to his or her opinionAnd mine is I wish I had my money back."
1,VENDOR HAS NOT RE-SENT PRODUCT,"I forgot to put apt. # on my initial address over 1 month ago - emailed Vendor to please resend and bill me accordingly for shipping, but the Vendor has not respnded and I have NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. NOT HAPPY CAMPTER>"
1,DVD,The DVD I purchased of Across the Universe did not work correctly. Most of the scenes were tiled and would skip. I was very dissappointed. Now I will have to buy it again somewhere.
1,Can't give it less than 1 star,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love movies of all genres, especially musicals. Perhaps I needed to drop a little acid to understand what was going on? Needless to say, I wasted quite a bit of time watching most of the movie, but I ended up turning it off before it was over."
1,I feel like going Helter Skelter on the positive reviews.,"How anyone that calls themselves a fan of The Beatles music can give this ""film"" anything more than 1 star after hearing the horrendous version/cover/bastardization of one of the greatest Beatles songs of all time,Helter Skelter,should be ashamed of themselves.Across The Universe should be shot across the universe never to be heard from again."
1,Spend your money on something worthwhile...,"I am so glad I didn't waste my money on this worthless ""film"".Being a Beatles fan, I was absolutely offended by this. The Beatles would be offended by this. John Lennon is rolling over in his grave right now.I went into this movie wanting so badly to enjoy it, but I left wanting that hour and half of my life back. Yes, that is correct, I couldn't even finish it. I got to the Eddie Izzard ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" scene where he is the leader of a carnival, and I had to turn it off because I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard.The overall only enjoyment I got out of this movie was a bellyache from laughing so hard at this ongoing joke of a ""film"".Don't waste your money on this movie. If you still want to see it, borrow it from a friend, but save your money for a movie that is really worth buying.End note: If I had a time machine, I would go back into time and stop myself from wasting any time on this horrid movie."
1,I am glad I VIEWED IT AT HOME SO I COULD SHUT IT OFF,[[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]This movie was one of the worst that I have seen in a long time. I am just glad I did see at home so I COULD PRESS STOP this movie. I JUST THREW MY MONEY AWAY.THE ROSE
4,Mesmorizing...,"""Across The Universe"" is two films in one: the first a linear story, and the second a travelogue in time. The story aspect, told through Beatles lyrics and musical numbers, is uneven and at times wanting for more depth and direction. Were ""Across The Universe"" judged by this alone, it would not hold up. Luckily there is the second film within the film, which grandly succeeds in visually and emotionally transporting you back into the sixties, where the love began, minds expanded, and, inevitably, the grand bubble was skewered by reality. In these segments there is true cinematic brilliance, where the viewer can almost smell the flowers and taste the acid as the music and imagery take them on an unforgettable ride through the beauty and tumult of the times. Though the very beginning and very end are a bit flat, the rest of this amazing film should be more than enough to both entertain and engulf you in a seductive, disturbing, and intimately moving experience."
5,Love it enough to own it!,"The library has it, true, but like I said, I love it enough to want to own it. One of those awesome sing-along musicals.Julie Taymor is an awesome director, and she plays the nurse(s) in ""Happiness is a warm gun."" Great cast (well, except bono, who I no longer admire or respect... but that's beside the point)."
5,perfect,This was exactly as it was described. I bought his as a present and it was appreciated. It was in prefect conditon.
4,Love at first view,"Stellar! I absolutely love this movie. The music is amazing (despite it being all covers of the Beatles, it is done very well, often bringing a new, refreshing light to the music). The acting is extremely believable (""oh yeah, they're acting!""). Very well thought out script and characters. Good mix of romance, drama, action, etc. I highly recommend this to young Beatles fans, but it still has a lot of merit for those who have never even heard of the Beatles (if there are such people)."
4,Love the movie and the music,"I rented this movie originally just to hear the Beatles soundtrack..then after that HAD to have it. Must have watched it at least ten times already..all the characters are good, the music still fantastic, and the second extras disc has lots of interesting stuff too. I bought two so I could give one as a gift. I enjoyed everything, including the fact that the two or three ""leads"" were all practically unknowns. If you like musicals, Beatles, a short 60s history lesson, it's all there..enjoy!"
4,Across the Universe Blue-Ray,Wife really liked this one. Nicely done and I ended up buying theAcross The Universe [Deluxe Edition]
5,What a great movie!!,"Loved everything about the movie... the story, the music, and the actors were great. For me, it was such ""feel good"" movie that I floated out of the theater on a psychedelic cloud.I bought the cd and I will definitely buy the dvd."
5,Great movie,"Easily one of the best movies I've seen in years and naturally, it is currently my favorite movie and I can't wait for it to be released."
5,such an awesome movie,"A modern story set to Beatles music (not the actual Beatles recordings) The story is great, the use of the music to tell the story is great, the singing is fabulous. Just an awesome movie."
4,Music pays tribute to The Beatles nicely,I read some of the reviews. To the people who were lost or didn't get it....definitly DO NOT see Rock of Ages then. You wouldn't get that either. Both movies are similar in that a story is created using old hit songs and their lyrics. Like Moulin Rouge. Across the Universe was good for the great music. Most of the songs were performed in the same style or version as the original. Very nice movie worth buying because it's worth seeing again from time to time. Weren't The Beatles great?
5,My skepticism vanished as I watched -- and loved it!,"I wasn't really sure what this movie was going to be like -- the person who recommended and lent it to me just said, ""You'll like it, it has a lot of Beatles songs in it."" Which it does. It's a rather clever musical that weaves Beatles numbers into a love story between Jude and Lucy (from ""Hey, Jude"" and ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" -- and yes, those songs are in there) taking place during the anti-war movement of the 1960s. But it is more than that. The photography, choreography, and animations are, in my opinion, on the level of art. As an oldster who remembers that era, I found it to be both a trip down memory lane and a movie that is still relevant and beautiful today."
2,Musical,This is a rock musical set in 1960s America. It features The Beatles' music and a brief nude scene. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're big on the Beatles. It was o.k. but I wouldn't want to see it again. I rented it.
4,Nostalgic for 60's fans & good music,A good little film (it has a plot) and good music (new talent on old songs); so good that I have ordered the soundtrack for this DVD.
2,Loved the music - disliked the movie,"I had little desire to see this movie, but based on a rave review from a best friend decided to be open minded. I must say that I definitely should have followed my first instinct.The music was fantastic and for those who love Beatles music as I do, will not be disappointed.The movie however was a completely different story. This movie was extremely drawn out with little flow and just plain boring. I watched this with my 16 year old and she couldn't wait to watch. When the movie was over, we looked at each and said ""Thank goodness that's over."" Not a reaction I was expecting.I can say that I would be tempted to purchase the soundtrack, but know without a doubt that the movie will not make my collection."
2,Disappointed,"When actors try to become professional singers, the results are usually disappointing. In ""Across the Universe"" they try too hard, hoping that the audience will be impressed with their singing. Their renditions are too self-conscious, too forced. It would have been better to use professional (talented) singers, rather than trying to turn actors into quality singers."
3,Across the Universe,"Product took a little longer than another item purchased at the same time, but overall I don't have any major complaints."
5,I LOVED it!!!,"Just scanning a few of the reviews...they all said it very well. Bottom line, I am ready to buy the movie and also for good measure the soundtrack so I have options. It was creative, fun, and just when it got to be a bit much..they broke into a fab song..what more could you ask??"
5,Love it!,"I love the Beatles and I like how they put their songs together into a story. They put some different spins on the ideas behind the songs, but it comes out good."
3,Has It's Ups and Downs,"The plot does take a back seat in this film, despite the filmmakers' attempt to make it seem like it is the main focus. The focus here however is the music. It was a good excuse to make a movie to sing Beatles cover songs, romanticize the sixties, and try and say something about the Vietnam war. Lesbianism is briefly covered as well here. The movie is not terrible, but it also is far from perfection. Also, between the director and the presence of Bono, there is some massive ego going on here. Some of the visuals seemed pointless, but were weird. Not that everything The Beatles did made sense but this is a film, and some parts felt thrown in just for the sake of being strange. I'm glad I saw it, and perhaps I will again someday. But until then, 3 out of five."
1,Terrible,"Terrible. This movie was TERRIBLE. If it was just a musical about the sixties, that would be one thing. But as someone who holds the music of The Beatles so dearly, I was appalled. Pretty much sums it up."
1,It really really sucked!,This movie sucked in new ways we haven't even seen before. I only spent 99 cents on a rental and I still feel that I was cheated.My 16 year old son and I (51) sat down hoping to hear some good music and see interesting images. It was so bad we kept fast forwarding through it. I wanted to poke my eyes out.....STOOOOOPID. How could anyone(like me)who actually remembers the Beatles and the 60's and 70's like anything about this atrocity.
1,Possibly the worst movie ever . . .,"One would think that the creation of a movie based on the music of the Beatles would be a good idea. And, in fact, it was . . . see A Hard Day's Night or even Yellow Submarine. Although some of the music was well-done in ATU, the plot was very loosely pieced together. Add somewhat psychadelic cinematography to the mediocre acting and dialogue and chunk hurling will ensue!If only it carried on the tale of those curse-wielding cowboys of the cosmos Memsahib Duran so accurately portrayed in her critically acclaimed The Duke of Shadows?"
3,Brilliant and bad,"This movie made me cry. Not because I was emotionally struck by the characters or story, but because the movie is a battle between bad ideas and brilliance, between art and commercial sap, innovation and cliche; and it depressed me that ultimately the weaknesses of this movie overpower the strengths. So I'm giving it 2.25 stars for the good moments: the fact that the acting and singing new versions of Beatles songs were well done, the artistic brilliance of Julie Taymor was apparent, but too infrequently, and the script had a bit of wit. But so sad that the story is really just a string of cliches and scenes which exist only so a song can be fit in. The characters which had nothing to do and existed only because their name is in a song(Prudence, Jojo, Mr. Kite, Dr. Robert), and the overlong scenes which made me cringe and really should have been cut down or cut out (A Little Help From My Friends, and Blackbird). So sad. Please start with a better script next time Ms. Taymor."
1,Warning! Parental Control Button Will Not Allow You to View,"I just want to warn people that you may not be able to view this DVD. When the DVD begins, there is a parental control screen and you have to punch in your DVD's parental control numbers or the DVD will not play. If you never knew your DVD parental control numbers and then go through your DVD setup to reset your own parental control numbers, it still will not play. I googled and found that MANY people were not able to view the DVD because of this problem. I bought this DVD some time ago and only now had time to watch it, or TRY to watch it. Guess what, when I tried to return the video, Amazon says my ""window"" of return has expired. I just want to warn people! I feel totally ripped off."
5,LOVED IT!!!,"Amazingly done, cast ad great voises and did a marvelous job covering the world's most popular and influential songs. Saw it twice in theaters and bought it the day it came out on DVD. A+ from me."
5,Best Movie Ever,This was the best movie ever. It had ALL my favorite Beatles songs. I'm a huge Beatle fan. I know almost every song and am so happy I watched it!! :D
4,Beautiful Beatles songs..,Excellent interpretation of Beatles songs. Highly recommended for music lovers. Especially Beatles fans will not be disappointed on this excellent Blue-Ray disc.
5,a must for Beatles fans,This is a great movie and a must for Beatles fans. The songs weave beautifully into this magical musical. Love it!
5,best movie of the year!,"This is a beautiful movie. The kind of timeless ones you want to keep for your children. Actors are great. story is great. Music is amazing (come on, it's the beatles!). DEFINITELY A GREAT PURCHASE."
4,Enjoyed it...,"You have to like musicals and the Beatles to appreciate this movie. I like both and really did enjoy this movie. I am 40 something and my husband is 50 something. Most of the actors are in their 20's, but I really love a talented actor who can act and sing. Another one I bought for my daughter and for myself for Christmas."
4,Beatles Momma Mia,"If you like the movie Momma Mia and you like the Beatles music, you will enjoy this movie. The singers have good arrangements for their respective voices and there is some really good choreograpthy in some sections. If you wish you had gone to Woodstock you'll enjoy it."
4,If you like the Beatles...,Wonderful story composed of and told through Beatles lyrics. If you lived through the Vietnam era you will remember everything that happens here. See how many of the cultural references you can pick out! Takes at least two viewings to catch them all.
4,Great Movie!!,This is an amazing Blu-Ray! The movie alone is great but the special features and the fact that its in Blu_Ray quality just makes it even better.. If you like Beatles music and amazing imagery this movie is for you.
2,Let it be more,The movie starts has great pace with the early Beatle lyrics blended beautifully into the screen dialog. About half way into the movie the songs get too somber and the pace gets too morbid. Julie Taynor's puppet effects that were used in the Lion King slows the movie and it attempts to be too trippy and we get dragged through these boring drug sequences that were too long and gimmicky. The Beatle music was sung at a pace that added new style and meaning. I loved the Beatles and thank Julie Traynor for even a vain attempt.
3,"Predictable, formulaic, but an interesting concept","All in all, a good way to introduce people to the Beatles. Long-time Beatles fans might love or hate it."
5,A Must Own,"How did I miss this movie when it was released in the theatres? This is a beautifully filmed story (yes, it has a plot) set to the background of Beatles' songs sung by a phenomenally talented group of newcomers. It's theme of peace couldn't be more appropriate for our times. It soars as high as your imagination. You'll never think of G.I. Joe the same way again."
4,great movie,"I loved this flick...great use of Beatles songs...I liked the little innuendos like Max banging with a silver hammer...or Prudence coming in through the bathroom window...it was entertaining...kind of a nice history lesson, too."
4,Wow I was surprised,"My whole family enjoyed this movie. Started watching this movie and did not expect much, but it pulled me in quickly. I ended up buying the CD which we listen to a lot."
4,Beatles universe,I love the creativity that took the music of the Beatles and the era in which it was written to find a story therein. It's not perfect but life isn't either so that's just fine.
5,Better than fine,Just as expected. Arrived in perfect shape and played same. I think it's a better movie than the critics gave it credit for.
4,Must like beatles' music,"Although this is an artsy rendetion of the Beatles music , I still loved this movie ! A bonus was having the actors actually sing the songs which gave this film a unique quality. I would recomend this for any ""child"" of the sixties , or anyone else that is a Beatles fan."
4,Brilliant,"The point of buying Blu-ray is to have a crystal-clear picture which is exactly what the cinematography of this film deserves. The movie itself is excellent. The story is filled with powerful, moving, radical scenes and images. However, the story itself is not great. There are some confusing points and much of it is random and does not move the story along. However, the soundtrack is excellent. I am saying this as a Beatles fan. The singers and muscicians certainly did justice to the greatest Beatles songs. My favorites are ""I want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""Let it Be."" If you simply want to be entertained and are a Beatles fan, then this is the perfect movie for you. The HD is the icing on the cake for sure."
5,A piece of art I wish I could hang on my wall,"This movie was beautiful, funny, crazy and fun. I highly recommened buying the soundtrack too. It was impressive that most of the actors in this movie were not singers, they were so on key that you would hope they would eventually release thier own record. Great movie!"
5,Across the Universe,Great movie. Clever way to journey through the 60s. The Beatle music is awesome even if it is not sung by them!!!
5,Across the Universe,This movie is great you'll find yourself singing along and singing to the songs long after the movies over. The Beatles will always the greatest!
1,All we are saying is don't give crap a chance...,"This film is utterly painful. The dialogue is abysmal, the plot non-existent, the ""hallucinatory"" special effects sequences laughable, and the Beatles songs are crudely shoehorned in whether they fit or not, complete with some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a film. I've liked Julie Taymor's other films, but she scraped the bottom of the barrel on this one. As far as recreating a vision of the late 60s, this film makes HAIR look like CITIZEN KANE in comparison. If you want to see a brilliant film that uses classic popular music as its core, check out Todd Haynes' I'M NOT THERE, but avoid this piece of crap at all costs..."
1,131 minutes I will never get back,"I am going to make this short because all the other bad reviews this movie got pretty much sum up my review. Horrible graphics, terrible acting, awful plot and way WAY too long. This movie should be listed as a comedy because I was laughing almost the entire time. I think they should warn you at the beginning of the movie that you should be doing drugs while watching to fully enjoy it."
2,Gets dull very fast,"Well, I like showtunes and the beetles. This movie does have some tripped out scenes that are cool and memorable parts. Unfortunately the music begins slow down and the film becomes incredibly boaring at the end, minus the last two songs at the end. It gets back to its lively self once max returns from the war but from his departure up untill then, its dull dull DULL!!! I to thought I was judging this film to harshly so I watched it all the way through. Nope, dull and to make it go faster I skipped to the ending as I should of done from the very begining. Other then it slowing down as a herd of turtles stampeedeing through peanut butter, the pros to this film is great effects and *some* memorable songs. All this is killed by the slow ending. I was somewhat disappointed but all I have to do is skip half the ending to the final few scenes to avoid the tedious parts."
2,Not for Beatle fans...,"I'm a Huge Beatles Fan and this movie did not made justice for the kind of music they used. The story was so plain, the singing was very teenage girl-like and the videos were so forced into the songs that they did not even made any sense. I believe making a movie with this theme was essential for our times, but this one does not keep up with the weight of working with something that is so important to so many people as Beatles music. If you are a Beatles fan, see it and see for how long you can watch without getting angry."
1,Did not get the movie,"The case I received stated that this was the 2 disc edition, just as advertised. Inside the case, however, there is only one slot for one dvd, and the one dvd that was sent was the ""second"" disc with special features. Therefore, I did not actually receive the movie that I purchased. Unfortunately, the ""return window"" for this product has expired, so I am unable to ask the seller to rectify the situation."
3,Starts out great...,"This movie starts out great, with great use of The Beatles' songs in interesting ways. Then the middle comes along - still some interesting use of The Beatles' songs, but not necessarily in a good way. The best way to describe it is ""weird,"" devolving into a psychadelic mess. The last third is better than the middle third, but not as good as the first act. The third act (and thus the film overall) is largely anti-climactic. Watch the first third of the movie and move on."
3,What's Blu-ray?,"I had to return my Blu-ray Across the Universe, because I don't have the equipment for viewing Blu-ray! So if you're out of sync with the latest technology, take my warning and always read the full product descriptions before buying. That'll save yourself the hassle of having to return stuff and the disappointment of not having ordered the right thing in the first place.The good news, though: Across the Universe is a fabulous movie! I highly recommend it as a great portrayal of the late 1960s with fantastic music, reinterpreted Beatles music for today."
5,ATU is AMAZING!!!,All I can say is this movie is amazing! Everyone I know that has seen it has bought it!
5,I Hate Musicals,"I don't like musicals. I think most are incredibly cheesey, so I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. I'm also a huge Beatles fan, so I had high hopes. The first time I watched it, I was extremely critical, picking out every flaw I saw. But after watching it, I found myself wanting to watch the performance pieces again. Jim Sturgess (Jude) has a beautiful voice and sounds natural singing Beatle songs. One of my favorite cover's was of Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite! It's all improv. I've watched Across the Universe again and again, and found something unique and interesting everytime I watch it. The imagery is spectacular and all songs are redone in good taste. Really a beautiful movie."
2,A dissapointment,"As a musical theatre junkie, as well as a Beatles fan, I expected to fawn all over this dvd.I was bitter by the time this was over.There is something off with the sound quality; every time they open thier mouths to sing, it sounds fake and dubbed to the extreme.The story is poorly sewn together, all in all I found this movie uninteresting and inorganic.A movie about hippies should feel natural.The musical numbers were well-produced, but all in all this movie is worth passing up.You want a good musical about the 60s? Try ""Hair"".Hair"
2,Same episodes,"I just received this yesterday excited that this was volume two of the series yet when I opened it and saw the first episode of it, it was the exact thing I had. I had the original complete collection and thought after looking over the box and seeing the name Vol. 2 that it was an additional group. If you have the complete collection blue box do not get this, it is a waste of money. I love the series and has wished it to be true that this was the second batch but alast, not."
1,Not as good as people think,"Not my Type of anime. My friend said I should get this since I love Azumanga then I would love this series. Well I freakin love Azumanga but I think Cromartie High School is really bad. So many reviews gave this a 5/5 even off of amazon. Iv'e never read the manga before but its just completely random and so boring to me. Anyways I got up to episode 21 but it took alot just to get that far. If you like Random Stuff that isnt that funny then i recommend this. If your looking for a good comedy I recommend Azumanga, Pani Poni Dash, Lucky Star, Or Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu. I am sorry if anyone was mad at my review who thought this is a really good anime. I just don't understand what make this good."
5,Funniest anime ever made,Honestly this show is like me and my friends when we like to act as satirical as possible. This show really hits home and we even have our own characters that are almost exactly like us when we like to screw around.
2,Disappointed Too,"I purchased this light and after a few months had a problem with it. I contacted Nite Ize, how promply issued an RMA and replaced the light under warranty. Shortly after receiving the replacement flashlight, it failed with the exact same problem as the first flashlight. I won't go with this light again, I am not very hard on flashlights, and this one failed during infrequent use around my home, I never even took it outside or camping or anything."
5,Great All Around Flashlight,"I have had maglights and other flashlights but this one, for the size and money is the best unit I have had. It is compact and uses std AA batteries. It is my std light for use when I need it around the house and auto repairs."
3,The late Olivia(although she did come HOME FOR CHRISTMASlol,"It is ethereal to read this novel as,in a book not long after,Olivia was crushed by a falling fridge and killed.Bummer.In this one Olivia starts a romance with a boy over the Internet,and does not realize it is Ken Matthews."
3,"Very lacking, especially considering that it was written by a Nobel prize winner","The main (and very important critique) of this book is its lack of an explanation as to how and why the economy of the nineties evolved and how and why it eventually led to a bursting bubble. One would think that a nobel prize winning economist would be able to provide insights into these questions. This is especially considering the case that he won his Nobel prize in Economics for his work in assymmetric information and markets, a factor that seems (at least on the surface) to have lead to ephermal growth of the nineties and its bubble. A very dissapointing book."
2,Dissapointed,"Readers expecting a lively,left of center interpretation of a prosperity decade in the manner of J.K. Galbraith's The Great Crash had better look elsewhere. Economist Joseph Stiglitz is a Clinton era ""New Democrat"", and the Roaring Nineties is appalling evidence of it. The book is more a history of Clinton's perfidious economic policies which Stiglitz admits were wrong, Republican even, policies which created greater eonomic inequality here and abroad and which allowed the predatory CEOs of major companies to plunder unsuspecting investors, individual and institutional. Stiglitz says that the policies were shaped by fear of Robert Rubin at the Treasury Department, Alan Greenspans's Federal Reserve, conservatives in Congress, and, revealingly, heavyweight campaign contributors. The book is a weasel's mea culpa. It's too little and too late. I'm embarrassed that I spent $29.95 on it."
2,"""New History"" = ""Rewritten History""","Don't be fooled by the title! I bought this book thinking that it would be an insightful analysis of the ""boom"" of the 1990's and the largely resultant ""bust"" that followed. Instead, I got a carefully constructed rewrite of history from the 1980's to the present.This book's primary motivation is to blame all of the world's current economic problems on political conservatives. It is wrought with inconsistencies and ommisions, in classic Clinton Adminstration fashion.Do not be fooled into thinking the author's has an objective viewpoint."
2,Would not recommend,"The reason I would not recommend purchasing this item (Hunter 30730 Tower Air Purifier) is that the price of the filter seem way too high priced for what the replacement hepa filters cost. At almost $30-40 a pop, depending on where you buy them, plus the carbon filter that has to be replaced as well, you can almost buy a brand new purifier. At some warehouse stores, you can buy TWO brand new purifiers for about $125.The Purifier works fine and seems to do the job it says it will do but until they lower the price of the hepa filters, I'll continue to regret ever buying two of the purifiers."
5,Great low cost effective filter.,This does it all with a very active Hepa system as well as a great Ion generator. Really does the job and love it's whisper sound which helps me to sleep.
2,"""Quiet""flow it is not!","To be effective, this unit must be on the highest speed. Do not plan to have a telephone conversation while standing next to this unit as it is very loud. Absolutely cannot be used while sleeping while in the highest speed. Sure it works, but if you are even the slightest sensitive to noise, this is not the unit for you."
4,Good Product,"The Air Purifier works very well. It is quiet enough to sleep at night. 9Big Plus) Whe I first started the Ioniizer it would snap every 15-30 seconds for about 24 hours. I was ready to return it, but it now only does it Occasionally.My Unit was scratched during shipment, but I decided not to return it and have to wait for a new one. (Packing was not the best!)"
3,A must for all Mahler lovers,It isnt hard to determine the influences that created this symphony. A semi skilled listener will at once recognize a wagnerian influence. But the wonder of this rendition of Rotts only symphony is the likeness to those early Mahler symphony. They(Mahler and Rott) were peers and it is striking how this symphony seems to sound as the architype for Mahler's early symphonies which would be released some seven years later. The music itself is pleasing to the ear and was done wonderfully by the Cincinatti Philharmonic. It's most wonderful moment is the Scherzo: Frisch und Lebhaft. On the whole I am glad I own this cd. It is an interesting buy for those who love classical music and especially Mahler. But those who are new to the classics should avoid this until they are more knowledgeable of its influences.
4,Sleeper? I think so!!!,"I was playing through the 2nd stage of this game thinking to myself, ""Why did I buy this???"" when all of a sudden I see this huge tower explode and competely crash to the ground. That right there was answer enough for me! I'm a huge sucker for games with fully destructible environments and this game delivers in spades in that area. The controls are silly easy and you can tell right away that this game was designed to be nothing more than non-stop action, run and gun, shoot 'em up fun!!! For only $30 this game is a must play! It's not what you'd expect from a 360 game, but it delivers where it counts. Fun factor is off the charts on this one folks! Happy gaming!!!"
5,Best. Game. Ever.,"This game doesn't kid itself. There is no real story, the dialogue is poorly dubbed Japanese. All this game is, is killing waves upon waves of giant bug aliens with cool weapons. It's some of the most fun I've had in a video game. Cheap too."
2,Why is this so popular,"A while back my friends and I bought a bunch of cheap and likely terrible games to play on a Saturday. The requirements were that the games had to be something we didn't have and it had to have multiplayer.The most expensive game of our gaming day was a huge let down. It was amusing for about 15 minutes, then we realized it's just the same awful graphics over and over. Some of the weapons were fun to try, but mostly it was just really repetitive grinding in an ugly game."
2,I don't get how people could find this fun,"I thought this game to be very behind in todays market. the gameplay was not interesting or fun, the story was awful, and the monsters childish. i must have played this game for a half hour before turning it off and posting it on ebay. i found Jet-Force Gemini to have more redeming qualities. i wouldnt pay more than 5$ for this title.Jet Force Gemini"
5,Seriously fun game!,"Very fun, very challenging, graphics are actually pretty good. High octane action game. FUN"
3,Near Mindless Fun,"This is a Shoot-em-up Game.I got it because it came very recommended.You and or a friend shoot giant BUGS and ROBOTS.There are A LOT of weapons to find and 5 levels of difficulty to find the on.This game really is in need of a refined part 2 for many reasons which is why I rated it so low but is still lots of challenging fun.There is no XBL but could really benefit from at least online co-op. You just get in, choose weapons go shoot!When you get new weapons you may feel like trying it out on the stage you just played. Then you mak feel like uping the difficulty to try it...See what I mean?Its cheap enough, get it."
5,great game,"the game is really fun and addicting. i couldnt put it down. the only thing is that its only fun if you are playing with a friend, as there is only a campaign. the game was like no other."
3,Beautiful music,"This harp wasn't what I expected. The music it plays is very calming and beautiful...I think I enjoy it more than my daughter. I thought my daughter would be able to actually play the harp...not so. Once again, this princess toy is for pretend. If you want a harp that your child can actually play, don't buy this. If you want a harp that plays beautiful music at the touch of a button, buy this harp. It is pretty with sparkles and the buttons light up while the music is playing. My 4 year old daughter and my one year old son loved it when we first bought it....they haven't touched it since. Good thing it's pretty because it has now turned into a lovely decoration."
1,Broken in less than a month!,My daughter received this toy as a gift and less than a month later it stopped playing music. For a $50 toy this is a rip off. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone! Very disappointed in Disney.
1,Broke right away,"My daughter really wanted this forever, so I ordered off Amazon for her birthday. She played with it a few times and the music got weird. We replaced the batteries. Nothing. Since we'd purchased it online, it was a pain to return. I contacted the company and they did not respond at all. Very disappointing."
2,Faulty Wiring,"My daughter loved this toy, but it stopped playing the music after two weeks. The figures kept moving, but the sound became garbled and then stopped. Finally, we returned it, only to find out that the new harp did the exact same thing. Yes, we tried new batteries only to have the same result. Reluctantly, we gave up and got our money back...At least we learned the songs."
1,wrong description,"The description said it was 36X24, when in fact, it is actually NOT that size. because it is too small for any of the standard 36X24 frames. The actual size is more like 34X24 and now I have to get it personally framed which is going to cost me a lot more than I was anticipating..."
3,LITTLE JOE AND HOSS AT IT AGAIN,"THIS IS A KIND OF EPISODE WHERE WE SEELITTLE JOE HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH HIS BIGBROTHER. LITTLE JOE KNOCKS DOWN A HOUSE OFCARDS THAT HOSS IS MAKING. AFTER THE CARDSARE ALL OVER THE TABLEAND THE FLOOR, WE SEEHOSS RUN AFTER JOE WHENBEN COMES WALKING IN,BUMPS INTO JOE AND GOESTO SIT DOWN BY THE DESK. STANDING BY HIS PAHE TRYS TO GET PAST HIM BUT WITH NO LUCKAS HOSS ADVANCES TOWORDSJOE. IT'S JUST A DELGHT TO SEE OUR LOVING CARTWRIGHTS ONTAPE FOR OUR VERY OWNTO WATCH OVER AND OVERAGAIN. FOR ADAM FANS, YOUONLY SEE HIM IN THEBEGINING AND A LITTLEIN THE MIDDLE. BUT, AGOOD EPISODE ALL IN ALL."
2,Wireless isn't as good as it sounds....,I bought this controller and was not happy to see that the slightest object in the path of the controller and the chip in the system would cause the controller to go on the fritz. During play I would loose the ability to control my character and it would cause me to loose battles especially with the episode III game. Stick with the set of controllers jedi and sith with the cords.
1,"product was not new, nor did it last","It is july 2010 and I ordered a ""New OEM"" extended life battery. I received a battery manufacturered in 2008. I gave it a try. It did not even last a day on standby.Not happy with amazon allowing poor retailers onto their site."
5,One of my favourites,"I love this album. Its not demonstrative of his prior excellent work with Imperiet or solo, its mellow, dark, pondorous and sentimental, yes, laden with gems, and it is a slow grower. Sure, it ain't for everyone. But it is poignant and sombre and reflective, and it just draws you in. Brev till 10:e vningen opens with its wonderful honest simplicity, Främling överallt is a favourite despite the 3 minute piano-driven introduction rising to a crescendo not representative of the rest of the song, and while Sönder Boulevard is beautiful, Om Black Jim closes the album with a mournful vocal display that is raw and beautiful. There is a real honesty and exposure in most tracks. Fan fan fan fits in perfectly with its slow piano and aching beauty and only Söndagmndagsng seems to be a filler for me. I adore this album and play it a lot."
2,Disappointing,"OK. This is not very good.Do not misunderstand me I have lots of respect for what Thaström has done and stood for over the years. He was in Ebba Grön one of the most important swediuish punk groups and then he did some neat solo stuff as well as the things with Love Peace and Pitbulls (I think it was called) that had really great techno industrial influences. This...is very boring. The guy apparently now thinks he is some kind of sensitive songwriter. The only song that starts well, Främling överallt even finishes like the rest of it, sentimental drivel. This kind of music really does depress me. Even worse than some of the acoustic drivel that sometimes Lundell puts on his records, but then even he has a nice rocker on his records..."
5,News from tvshowsondvd.com concerning the missing booklet !,"From tvshowsondvd.com...We started receiving reports that Gilmore Girls: Season One didn't include a booklet even though there's a pouch for it. There should be a booklet included in the set (it's a nice one) so we started to investigate the problem. It looks like booklets were left out of some, or possibly all, of the Canadian sets. We've contacted Warner Bros to let them know of the problem and they sent us a contact name and number for consumers to request a booklet if their set was missing one.Jose Roldan 416-250-8385 ext. 377Please note that this should only be used if you live in Canada and purchased a set without a booklet."
5,simply the best,"this show is way ahead of it's time. The writing, the acting, it's the total package.I've just got into the show this year , so it was nice to see where it all began.The packaging for this set is awesome.I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves smart, funny, heart touching shows.one last thing, my dvd set did not come with a booklet inside. Wondering if there should be one ?Please, write a review and let me know"
4,Wonderful show,I absolutely love this show and was excited when I saw the first season on DVD. I had to give it 4 stars because of sound quality. At times it sounded like the actors were in a box. Other times the voices didn't exactly match up with the actors' mouths.
1,"Why get into a show, when as a whole it disappoints",They create this show thats funny and witty...then they don't tie things up at the end of the series. Very disappointing :(
1,I got jipped!!!,I received an incomplete DVD set - the first and second DVD were identical! I'm done with Amazon - I'll buy local.
2,Gilmore Girls Season 1,"I thought that by buying the dvd directly from Amazon that they would both be new. I bought the first and second season from them. The second season arrived perfect but the first one did not. Even though it was wrapped in plastic the plastic case that holds the dvds falls out and I had to glue it back in. Also, the paper manual that comes in the disc looked like someone had cut it. It was very odd."
4,bought it for my gf,"she loves it but says it doesn't get ""really good"" until the second season. holla"
2,what a waste of money,"I order the first season of the Gilmore Girls.I love this series. I wore my origional new set out. I had tried earlier to buy a like new copy and was disappointed. This set disappointed me as well. The disc jacket and ""Pages "" were not joined and disc 3 and 4 had stops and scratches on them. Again a waste of money.Their description of this set wa so nice I knew there would not be any problems. I was wrong."
3,Good Show all around,"This show is amazing, the relationship between the mother and daughter is one only for tv obviously. I think this would be every mother and daughters dream relationship. I enjoyed watching the shows beginning, seeing how it all started. i have been catching episodes on and off for a few years, never really getting too involved, though i have to say from what i've seen of this coming season Rory isn't taking a good turn. My biggest complaint with this set is the lack of extra features. There are NO commentary's at all, and very few behind the scenes stuff. The quality is great, some due to the fact that there are 6 disks. This quiet little town draws you into their world, and you'll love being there!"
5,"Satisfy your Gilmore Girls craving, anytime!","Gilmore Girls is hands down one of the best shows that has even been on television and now you can throw away those nasty VHS tapes that you've been watching and rewatching for the DVD version, with NO COMMERCIALS! (Not that I thought the commercials would be there, but you get the point.)With these DVDs you can relive all the wonderful Gilmore moments: why Luke and Lorelai are meant to be together, Rory and Dean's rocky relationship beginnings, and even Sookie and Jackson's love. Please, don't miss out on this, so much of what has happened in the past seasons make rewatching the beginning so much more worthwhile!"
5,Fast service,This was a gift. The recipient received it quickly. THe product was in great condition and she thoroughly enjoyed the first season.
5,Perfect therapy!,"This is my favorite form of therapy-a heaping dose of the Gilmore Girls! Awesome acting, perfect timing, beautiful scenery, playful banter, can't get too much Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! Oh, yes, the best part? Scott Patterson, the hidden secret to the whole show! Yummy!"
5,Gilmore Girls is simply the best,"Gilmore Girls is and always will be my most favorite show. Others have come to my taste as well such as Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives, but this will always remain the best! It always help me laugh when I need it, smile when I need it, and even sometimes shed a few tears. I know this sounds really cheesy, but I'll say it anyway: The Gilmore girls are always there for me! HahahaAnyways, I highly recommend buying this and starting off the wonderful show with the spectacular first season. I myself own all the seasons on DVD and am still impressed to this day.Hope this was helpful and you buy it! Haha :)"
2,Last disc didn't work,The last disc on this thing was broken. I tried to play it in multiple ways and it did not work. I don't want to waste the time returning just the one disc it was only 4 bucks anyway.
1,"wrong disc, poor condition","I've been gradually buying the Gilmore Girls TV series dvds and just started to watch them. Unfortunately, my Season One is essentially worthless because the disc identified as disc 1 contains the episodes from disc 2, so I am lacking the first episodes of the series. The discs are also in very poor (unplayable) condition. Unfortunately, I ordered this too long ago to return it, so I will have to replace it. I don't recommend this seller."
2,Missing Disc,There was a disc missing from my season of Gilmore Girls. I will never order a DVD without the complete packaging again.
5,woo-hoo!,"Its about time! This show gives me warm fuzzies, nice memories and quality entertainment. One of the best shows on Tv."
5,Gilmore Girls-Season one,Strong quirky woman just trying to make a go of the life she was given. My daughter wanted to start her own collection of this series and Santa was able to oblige. We look forward to purchasing the next chapter in the spring.
3,Excellent Series,This is a great series that we're catching up on. Where were we? The only disappointment we have is that the video resolution is mediocre at best on an HDTV.
4,Mother or daughter,"This show hits the mark! As a mother and a daughter and more precisely a mother of daughters, I see a lot of myself in this show! LOVE Lauren Graham!"
4,Gilmore girls complete first season review,"this is an incredibly good purchase! if you love gilmore girls this is a must have, actually if you love Gilmore Girls I don't know why you don't have this already. enjoy!"
5,Finally! Now hurry up and get the rest of the seasons out!,"It's about time they put this show on DVD! I hope they get the rest of the seasons out just as fast because it is definitely worth it! This set is great for when you just want to watch TV, when you need something to keep you occupied when you're not feeling well, or when you need a little pick me up! How can anyone not love this show? I hate to say it because it's only a TV show, but it really does succeed in brightening a cloudy day and it does make you feel good!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!"
5,"Brian, what are you saying","Brian,As a father of a teenage daughter I have watched the Gilmore Girls to ensure that the content is age appropriate. This is pure ""chick flick"" material not at all for macho guys like you or me. The dialogue, the story and the character development are targeted at girls. The 5 stars is from my daughter who loves the show. The mother would drive anyone insane, she acts like a sister and is so far removed from the personality of a real parent that the show is unwatchable,at least for this male."
1,Finally they cancelled it.....,"well this series (like almost all Warner Brothers Television these days) quickly degenerated into adult trash. The first season, was what it was. A single mother trying to get her only daughter through school. But oh how it fell apart in further seasons. The two women ended up in bed with a different guy almost every other episode. The grandmother got plain annoying, the grandfather always looked clueless, the supporting cast were given stories that were not the least bit interesting, and the season finales always looked like poor takes off of Dallas and Dynstay. That was the end straw. That this show fell apart into a prime time soap that had lousey stories and even worse, showed how cruel human beings can be to each other. Finally the network just cancelled this trash. Finally. Gilmore Girls was garbage and now it's been gotten rid off like garbage. YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GET A LIFE."
5,Go For Gilmore,I resantly started to watch this show back home. Never got to see the first sesons witch I hear is much better. But I like the new ones as well. But I think I have to buy the firts seasons to see how good the show really is. I love te charchaters my fav.charcather is Lorely. Royrys mother. She's funne and serios at the same time.
2,Disappointing DVD Transfer,"I was waiting impatiently for this series to be released on DVD because I really love it. However, I was really disappointed when I received my copy. The quality is so bad that nobody would believe that it's an original copy!WB is not being fair by producing this series in low quality DVD transfer because they've done a good job with ""Smallville"". I hope they won't repeat the same mistake in the future.As for this copy, I really hope that I could exchange it when they release it with better quality!"
2,Damaged Product,I was very disappointed to see that after opening the package all of the disks were scratched. Some were even scratched so badly they would not even play. The product was not packaged or protected well for shipping causing the disks to move around and become scratched.
3,"Great show, scratched disks",When I purchased this product it was advertised as new. When I went to view the DVD's several of the disks were scratched and only would play on one of my DVD players. Needless to say I was disappointed with the quality of the product. The content however is quite a different story. I always love the quick witted banter of mother and daughter.
5,More Gilmore,"My wife adores the series and I like it, too. She'd seen this back in college and talked about it for some time, so I took a chance ... and it payed off! Now, she's hooked on the whole series."
5,more than a mother daughter show,i cant say enough about this show im a 24 year old guy and as one reviewer stated its not just for girls this show is very well written and the acting is flawless especially with alexis bledel playing rory the daughter of lorelai played by lauren graham together they are the gilmore girls they live in a peaceful town where everyone seems to know each other the humor and quirkyness of the characters is so enjoyable to watch as well as the chemistry of rory and lorelai i highly recommend this to anyone!
5,Hilarious Dialogue,"I had bought a few books from amazon and needed 10 bucks more to get free shipping, so I browsed a few movies. I came across the Gilmore Girls collection and remembered watching an episode or two a few years back and after reading the fantastic reviews, purchased the first season. I love the witty dialogue and refreshing characters and found myself immensly enjoying ALL of the subplots, which is something that doesn't happen to often for me. I'm now buying a season whenever I have a break from school and hopefully I'll own the complete series for years to come!"
3,"Great Show, Bad DVD","This is a great show, but whoever is responsible for putting out the DVD put no effort into it at all (like the writers for the 4th season of the show). There are essentially no extras except for a little junk on the last disc. And the ""chapter"" breaks are few and far between. For a great tv show AND a great dvd, check out Freaks and Geeks."
1,"a technical tour de force, but otherwise a waste of time","If you like Liszt and romantic excessiveness, you'll love this disc (and indeed the other discs in the series). If however, you share my tastes -- everything from early Baroque to late Beethoven and not too much thereafter, you'll probably despise this.To see why, consider for example, track 2 of disc 1, entitled ""Réminiscences de Don Juan"" -- almost 20 minutes of music based on Mozart's Don Giovanni. I love Don Giovanni and know it very well. I would say about 4 or 5 minutes are completely recognizable Mozart, about 10 minutes are butchered Mozart and the rest are pure Liszt extravagences. You will be very impressed with Howard's playing, but if your looking for recognizable transcriptions of both well-known and obscure operatic works, you will be disappointed. This track is more Liszt than Mozart. And one can make similar comments about the other tracks."
5,I'm a living success story,"When I was a baby, my mom (against the advice of many people who thought they knew it all) took STEP classes. I grew up in a very loving household where discipline was constant and sensible, thanks in part to the skills my mom learned through these classes. Now that I'm grown and bringing up a little girl of my own, my husband and I are turning to these books to help us give her the best start we can toward being a good human."
4,Parenting Handbook,"This handbook provides a great foundation for conducting discussions and introducing positive discipline practices to young parents. It is simply written with each chapter introducing a new skill. I have used it for the past several years and although I supplement with extra information from various sources, it remains the core of the Parenting Class that I teach."

3,Black TV Swivel STand,"I'm pretty much satisfied with the stand, it's a little bit bigger than I thought but It's what I wanted."
1,"really terrific idea, terrible execution","We need a book about the fine, vivid, beautiful film art of Whit Stillman, but not this one. An extraordinarily foolish and clunky collection of (mis)readings which calls to mind D.W. Harding's famous observation about the novels of Jane Austen: works which appeal to precisely the sort of people whom the author most despises. The essays commissioned especially for the book are particularly fatuous; the reprinted reviews not quite so appalling. Save your money and buy Stillman's novel 'The Last Days of Disco' instead."
2,Heads up!,"It's not obvious at first glance but this is a book from a publisher promulgating Christian and Conservative thought. It's a book with an axe to grind and an agenda which is not an academic, or even especially high-brow, discussion of Whit Stillman.If that's your cup of tea and you like Whit Stillman, enjoy. Otherwise, just listen to the commentary tracks on Metropolitan and Barcelona again."
1,Please don't fill me in if I missed something here.,"Some lady spends lots of time digging in the dirt. Oh yeah, and a drunk guy hitch hikes with a punk rock band and smokes pot.That's all I can remember. Please don't fill me in if I missed something here."
2,**SIGH**,"Once in a while, Stephen King writes something that makes me swear off Stephen King for awhile. This was the first time I had read something by Stephen King that I didn't like. The vast majority of Stephen King books are great or at least good. In this one, King creates likeable characters - then kills them off. The protagonists left over are completely unlikeable. There is also an improbable, unhinted-at plot twist: the aliens lack common sense. It felt like King wrote the story into a corner, then had to throw in a way to beat the omnipotent baddies.I am not saying that this book is bad or not worth reading - nothing Stephen King writes meets that description. I would start with something else and put this at the bottom of the pile, under The Stand, It, Salem's Lot, The Dead Zone . . . and just about everything else King wrote except Cell (which has the same plot problems, albeit with likeable protagonists)."
3,A Good Read That Kind Of Fizzles....,"Although others may disagree with me, I found the Tommyknockers to be my least favorite King book. Not because of the meat of the book which does its job of keeping you glued to the pages but the fact that the end kind of fizzled where usually King's books end with a bang. I find Stephen King to be the master of the imaginary monster and I suppose the reason why it didn't do well for me was because I was not expecting anything about aliens. I was under the impression that we were supposed to be looking under the bed for the monster and not the sky. Perhapes it is that fact which attributes the lowest grade I've ever given a King book. Nonetheless, had I known what to expect, I probably would have enjoyed it more. Either way, I'm glad I read it."
5,"""A Bit of a Switch For Stephen""","I can't say that ""The Tommyknockers"" is one of my favorite books written by Stephen King, but the novel (which debut in 1987 and spawned a TV miniseries) does have its moments.Taking place in a small town in Maine one of the inhabitants walks in the woods one day and comes across a mysterious object that releases toxic gas into the town. People actually become alien-like and start doing morbid things like killing each other, sending others to different planets, etc. So, if you've expected something calm and serene from King don't read this book because like all Stephen King novels this one has its share of horror moments, chills, surprises and ultimate spine-tingling chapters.On an average out of 10 for a King masterpiece I rate this a 7 because of originality."
1,YAWN,"They dug, they dug, and they dug some more. Get the picture? Oh yeah, then they dug some more. King does it again! Page turning beginning, never ENDING ending. He must learn to wrap it up!"
2,too many pages,"This book got boring after a while. Sure, it's exciting in the starting with the digging up of the spaceship and the end also, but in between King just goes on about little side stories about things happening to the people of the town, which were mostly boring and time-consuming. If you want to read this book, read a shortened edition without all the useless information in the middle."
1,750 pages and still nothing.,"First of all, if you are going to write a 750 page book about a space ship and in the course of that book mention the bodies of dead aliens, it would be nice if perhaps there were a little history about where the hell it came from. The only reason I kept turning the pages was to find out the history of this race, but King never even mentions it. He just kills everybody and then lets the little orphaned magician and his brother survive. They disappeared except for the beginning and the end of the book! Horrible book. Waste of your time to even read the first page. King must have been drunk."
3,It was not the best of King's Work,Try just borrowing the book instead of buying it!It could be a wise decision!
3,Not King at his best,"This book just seemed to drag on and on.King has so many great books, this is just not one of them.None of the characters were very beliveable, like in some of his stories (The Stand, It, etc.)"
3,Just try another books...,"This is not the best of King's work, and I think he is not accustomed with ""science fiction horror"" style like this. Just save your money and buy another books (if you insist to own Stephen King's work, try THE STAND)"
3,"Umm, Good 'cept little too much adult content!",Very gruesome and inspiring plot er something but totally too much sexual content which I assume all his books have!Yuck!
3,Fantastic hardcover and a fairly strong book,"I describe The Tommyknockers as King writing Invasion of The Body Snatchers. Both of them involve aliens possessing people in a small town and trying to convert other people to become like them. I don't even care if it is Invasion of The Body Snatches as long as its entertaining, and for the most part The Tommyknockers was. However, at some point I got really tired with the book and shamelessly skipped about 100 or more pages. I didn't really miss much of the storyline, which was actually kind of sad. Now maybe you think I'm lazy but I finished Under the Dome without skipping pages. Bottom line the book has a nice hardcover, but its only halfway decent."
4,An alien venture for King,"While this is a pretty good book, it's not among King's best I'd say. I was wondering if this was King's first novel about aliens, though I guess I'm not enough of a King scholar to know for sure. I'd say it's a little too long for my taste- 700+ pages- as I tend to go to sleep a little with King's longer books, such as this, ""The Stand"", and ""It"". As usual with King's books, character development is one of the stronger points of this book; I found these characters eccentric and interesting- perhaps not your standard hero types. I also found the description of the aliens interesting and not really all that scary, though I'm not sure King was trying to scare us too much with this one. Overall, an entertaining read. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
3,Not his best,"This book started off great, but went downhill quickly. It was almost like he couldn't decide how to end it."
4,"Interesting, but confusing.","I very much enjoyed the story, however, it is a bit confusing. Good read none-the-less. Not the scariest he has written, but very cerebral."
3,too much-- too much-- knocking on my door,"there's just too much book here. i've never disengaged from an SK book before, and length itself doesn't scare me (i put up with ulysees and infinite jest). but this one just sprawled too much and i found myself skimming quite a bit. never done that before with steve. i am a ""constant reader."" oh well, can't bat 1000. the post-poetry reading party scene with drunken gard is great. the premise of the book is great. bobbi and gard are great and greatly developed, and then...oh man it just got to be too much. my give-a-crap meter started really flagging. the failure here is execution, not story and not premise, but overall bloat/length and the constant POV shifts. there can be too much of a good thing."
2,"TOO LONG, TOO TEDIOUS","The book starts out promisingly enough with a female novelist unearthing a spaceship buried on her land. But then Mr King dissolves into hectares of verbiage that don't advance the story one iota. You could take out whole chapters and no one would notice, because the plot doesn't advance an inch in that time. Add to that Mr King's customary infatuation with scatology and what you have is an utterly tedious piece of work."
1,it is boring....,"this is my first stephen king book and its a disappointment, the book length is too long and could be shortened by half, it's one of the few books that i cant seemed to finish(which is rare), its a very slow-paced story and utterly boring although the concept of the story is fresh and rather good and since i read this i have not read any other stephen king book"
1,Not My Favorite!,"Stephen King is usually more brilliant than this. The movie was a complete disaster. However, since books always seem to be better than the movies, I thought I'd give this one a try. Trust me...stick with the movie. It sucked, but not nearly as much as the book."
4,A well written nightmare,"Grippy, edgy, and frightening. I read this when my son was loosing most of his baby teeth over a month long period--the nightmares were astounding..."
4,king at his best,"this was the first book i read by stephen king when i was nine years old. it is chock full of interesting characters, plots, and storylines, but runs a bit dull through the middle of the book, for about 200 or so pages. rumors of King being long winded are certainly proven correct in this novel, but it is well worth the time to get through it, just keep an open mind"
4,Good read - but a few chinks in its armor,"This was my first Stephen King book and, overall, I really liked it. The plot was very interesting even given that, from an initial standpoint, it is sort of hackneyed. But I have always been a sucker for the ""insidious invasion"" type scenarios. What really made me like it was the characterization that was done, particularly for good ol' Gardner. When you realize that the protagonists of the novel are filled with more shortcomings, in some ways, than the antagonists, you have a good love-hate thing going with the characters.The ""chinks in the armor"" of this good story, however, start to show up for me near the end of the book where what is basically meant to be scary (or at least threatening in a sci-fi sort of way) almost turns into a bad B-movie set of props. However, by that time I was so hooked into the story that I pretty much took it all in stride. Overall, a very entertaining book with great characterization."
1,Every editor has an off day....,"Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and his Dark Tower series is some of the most amazing fiction I've ever read. But this book should have been about 200 pages shorter, and the concept needed a lot of work. I'm actually glad I read it, because now I'm sure that I don't just blindly like his work - this one I definitely didn't like."
1,I Hate This Book,"I could go on to explain why I don't like this book and save you from having to read it, but I don't know where to begin. I loved Carrie, but this is a huge let down. I don't know why people think this is one of King's best works. My god this this is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. On the plus side, the novel does start out nicely, but sadly it all goes downhill into a spiral of aliens and random; pointless events. The plot makes no sense when one closely examines it and that is what is the biggest let down. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1,"Oh, Where has my King gone?","I am such a huge fan of SK that it even bothers me to write this review. If I could give it 0 stars I would. How sad that SK had to write something so incredibly bad. I have been reading his books since High School, and I'm 34 now, I actually read this book when it was first published and I have shunned it ever since. If you are thinking of reading SK for the first time go to The Stand, IT or if you want something a little less in length go with Firestarter. Just stay away from this meaningless book."
1,Worst Ever,"I know I will probably take some shots for this, but as a huge Stephen King fan I found this book to be the worst he ever wrote and the only one I didn't finish. The story was so unbelievable I questioned whether King really wrote it. If you read this then you read a classic like ""The Green Mile"" I think you will agree that this book is not up to the usual King standards."
3,Not up to King's usual standard,"Many people have problems with this novel, and I certainly agree with them, but in terms of laying blame I hold the editor almost as responsible as King. The book is ludicrously overwritten, indulgent, tangential and full of plot holes, and while King created it, I think not reining him in was a horrible disservice both to his talent and to his fans.Inside the 752 pages of The Tommmyknockers is a wonderful novel of about half that length. The story has numerous memorable moments and King is great at creating a feeling of impending doom. But the fact that his editor didn't make needed cuts and demand some simple rewrites is a real shame.This is a strange and beautiful book that's buried, much like the flying saucer itself, under a massive pile of debris."
3,Tommyknockers makes the grade by a hair.,"I think i read this novel when i was either 16 or 17 years old. The two main characters (bobbi anderson and jim gardner) are developed on a level that is ""king on steroids"". Many people would say ""overdeveloped"" and would also say your better off skipping the first 200 pages and just get right to the point but for me, when bobbi anderson stumbles upon that small piece of shiney metal sticking out of the ground in those woods one day, the story takes hold. There are already plenty of reviews that go into strong detail so i won't bother doing so again. 3/4 of the way through the book is where i started to struggle a bit and for the first time ""not agree with what king was writing here"" and even though i think the ending is semi-solid, i give the novel a 3 star rating. Far from his worst though."
4,good imagination but ending dragged,Stephen king wrote this book with great imagination self moving coke machines etc... I mean how many people can actually imagine dying by a soda machine and it makes sense only in a way he wrote the book a higher intelligence buried in a ground who specialize in making off the wall type stuff and cowinceadently that intelligence is passed on the more the ship in the ground is uncovered.I thought the characters were well explained and had no trouble imaganing what they looked like. The one thing I did not like was the ending I thought it was vague and kinda short sorta like he was in a hurry to finish it and just threw toghther a ending just to finish this already long book.I feel he should have shortened the middle which I felt was to long and he should have worked harder on the ending but thats just my opinion
1,Four Stars ?,"I am questioning if Stephen King even wrote this book. Humm its not bad if you can look past the lack of direction,...poor character development, and waste of human life it would take to give this standstill a read. Do yourself a great favor and sit upon your porch and watch the grass grow ,...its a more thrilling time."
2,"Rip off of the 1967 movie ""Quatermass and the Pit""","Here's the plot of the British science fiction movie, ""Quatermass and the Pit "" released in 1967, 21 years BEFORE King published Tommyknockers: Workers excavating at an underground station in London uncover the skeletal remains of ancient apes with large skulls. Further digging reveals what is at first believed to be an unexploded German bomb from World War II, but it is an alien space craft. Within it are dead locust-like aliens are found. The opening of the alien space craft, triggers alien mind-control of the local population.Plot sound familiar? As usual, King's writing is engrossing and enjoyable: B+ for writing, F- for originality."
4,The Ending Was So Drrraaaaggggeeeddd Out,"A great book, interesting (desipite the plot holes); But I'll echo what the fellow said about King's endings needing work. My biggest complaint is that it should have been about 50 to 100 pages shorter at the end. Every thought and nuance of movement was described in the climatic scene. Let it end already!"
3,tommy is entertaining,"this book has a very good opening. a woman finds an object in her garden soon it begins to influence locally. people get smarter, more callous, and physically transformed. can anyone stop them. some people are still human, but they have the odds against them. the transformed are coming together, plotting. it was an entertaining read. pearticularly enjoyable was the opening, and the inventions (i liked those very much). but the plot was sort of lost at times. i guess this novel should have been cut down. there were a few sidetracks here that took up too much space, being irrelevant to the plot. entertaining. don't expect too much plot."
3,Good read,"I enjoyed this book. While it was long, and a bit slow at parts, there were always plenty of interesting things going on. All the characters were well written, as is usually the case with King, and the plot was interesting."
3,It is good but not great,"The Tommyknockers is best described as an interesting book about the unknown, specifically alien artefacts, but also happens to be a bit of a let down in certain departments, namely the conclusion and some plot development that goes a bit stray. The Tommyknockers is certainly his most original work and is a cross between ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Salem's Lot"".Basically a woman discovers a crashed UFO in the woods, digs it up, becomes hyper-intelligent and this ""alien virus"" spreads to others in the town who find themselves up to all sorts of good and bad things in very peculiar ways.When all is said and done the characters are interesting and it has its moments as you would expect from this author, but ultimately it is a bit of a letdown and doesn't really finish quite like it started. King has done better but then again a lot of other authors have done worse. This is only really for the King lover. Go elsewhere if you want a good King book."
2,Knock knock on the door Tommy....Not,I read this book long ago and i didn't like it too much mainly cuz it was boring for the first 150 pages or so. And the story had a bad ending that was just blah. Not a typical King ending.There are better King's reading than this lame excuse.
2,The Tommyknockers,"I will probably be going against the apparently popular theme of these other reviews below, but I would have to say that this is a prime example of how I believe Stephen King's works are nothing much to acclaim. The Tommyknockers, as said in many past reviews, is basically about a town molded into a colony of alien like beings. As good as the premise might seem, I feel that the book is an overall poor conception, mainly due to the ""cast"" of characters is really nothing but mindless annoyances that no reader would even want to become acquainted with. In any novel, one should be able to feel for the characters in the book and should naturally not feel hatred toward them. This, unfortunately, is something too common in most of King's works. I, for one, did not enjoy this novel, and it will probably be the last of King's I will ever read."
2,DON'T SEE THE MOVIE OR READ THE BOOK.,"This a very original book, but it just plain sucks. If you awnt good Stephen King you read ""Desperation"" or ""Christine"". They just are better books. I just hope it wasn't ment to be scary because it wasn't. It took me a long time to finnish this,because it was so boring. My recomendations are Desperation, Christine, the Shining, or the Dark Tower Books."
2,Get to the point,"Tommyknockers was a long book. I enjoy King's short story collections, (Different Seasons"", Four Past Midnight, The Bachman Books) and his earlier novels but Tommyknockers just took too long to get to the point. I read Bag of Bones recently and I feel the same way about it... ""I read the entire book for this?"""
2,A fair book,+AH4-This book is unusual. It's very boring at some parts (I fell asleep reading this book). There's only a few exciting parts but they wear off fast. You should try reading his better books first.+AH4-
2,Not as good as it can be,"The Tommyknockers is not a very good book. I regretably read through the whole thing, and have to say that it is not one of his best. When i was finished, i felt a space of emptiness. The ryme about the Tonnyknockers knocking at doors made absolutly no sense. The plot was weak, the chacters were not ones i liked to read about, and the climax and ending were just inadaquit. -Daniel C. Kilmarti"
2,King could do MUCH better.,"Style: AForm: ACharacter Development: AContent: D-Storyline: D-King leads this story along in an almost frantic pattern. Moving about in a very strange drug induced way.The characters are real enough, but he seems to lose reader with way too many unnecessary pulls.It seems to lose the appeal of a true King book. Next time, maybe.."
5,The Tommyknockers,"This has to be one of the best books I have ever Read, from the part where Gard is attacking the Nuclear Technician to where he is thrown out of the house-party. I just love Stephen King's graphic description of everything, he has a way with words alright...... One of my other favorite parts is where That lady (mind slip) was in the Clocktower/bell-tower and the bats attacked her and threw her down the steps and building exploded..... they also repaired it with a Hologram!From the Storage-Space Altair-4 to the Excavation of the Space-Ship, This was the best book I have ever read!"
2,Far Out -- Way Far Out,"The farther that Stephen King's books stray from plausible reality, the weaker they often are. In addition to being WAY too long, ""The Tommyknockers"" suffers from a second half that stretches believability to the breaking point. The setup is effective, of course at this point the reader has no idea what is causing the increasingly horrific events in the town. The answer, as it unfolds, is a bit of a disappointment. Also, few of the many characters engender any sympathy. This is not one of King's better novels."
5,Of the 20 or so KING novels i've read this is #1!,"As you will see in the other reviews of this book, you either love or hate this novel. Personally I think it's the best king book i've read, actually I can't decide if I like IT better or not. If your not a sci-fi person you won't like this title. But if your into it, this is by far as good as you can get. I don't reccomend the movie version though, it was really really bad."
4,"Good for true King fans, but...","The Tommyknockers was a pretty good book. I think, though, that this would be a bad book for someone reading King for the first time. It wasn't scary, but was more creepy. In fact, I consider it to be more of a sci-fi novel than a horror story. If you want a scary King read, choose something more like The Shining."
4,if you love to read you'll love this book,this book was long yet very interesting and very well written. But if you don't like to read 750 page books i don't recomend this one. only for the people who love to read will this be a joy.
3,"pretty good, but some flaws","First off, if your looking for portability this unit cant be beat. The ability to use batteries is great. That being said you are making some definite sacrifices. I don't know if it's just mine or everyones but it hisses a little when you pull in close, not so bad from across the room, and the bass in the back sometimes distorts the sound of the front speakers. Another little annoyance is the fact the on the box is says a USB cable is included to sync to your computer when there isnt one included. I don't know if im supposed to buy it seperatly or what. Overall it's a good give and take system, if you want pretty good sound on a portable system its good, but move to a larger one if you generally keeping it in one spot.Update: Evidently some boxes shipped with a misprint saying a USB cable was supposed to be inlcuded. The correct packages do not come with a USB cable. JBL is honoring the misprint though so check out their website and tell them if you want one."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"When I first recieved the speakers, I was a bit dissapointed in the dinky sound it projected. It can't get very loud before sounding cheap.The biggest problem that I have with it is that it breaks. About 3 months after continual use, it starts to make this loud buzzing noise. Whenever it gets knocked slightly, starts to play louder, or plays a high bass, the annoying buzzing noise begins.I suggest you to find another speaker set. These are not worth it, will probably break and sound like crap."
3,I wish it also charged the ipod.,"I have this and the ontour models. Both have good sound for a small package. overall i'm more satisfied with the lower cost one($29.95), even though it doesn't have the remote or the dock station. the main reason i bought this was i didn't want to travel with a charger, sucks for me when i found out this didn't recharge the ipod battery."
1,Unerring Eye Meets Vacuous Mind,"I opened Out Of This Century expecting guidance, a light that would show the way. How did Ms. Guggenheim pick the good stuff? What muse informed her choices? Think she'll clue you in? Not a chance. Ms. Guggenheim isn't up to the task. This autobiography reveals a stunningly superficial personality. If you like soap operas you'll love this embarrassment."
3,Some significant omissions,"This is the kind of book that I devoured while in elementary school. It is a collection of facts about the solar system, with short chapters on each of the planets, the sun, galaxies and the Earth's moon. Conspicuously absent is any discussion of other bodies such as the asteroids, comets and the potential for other planets. While it is certainly a good introduction to the facts about the solar system, these omissions make it a weaker book that a few more pages could have corrected. Also note that the publication date of 2001 means that recent explorations may have altered some of the ""facts."""
1,Typical TFH publication...,"Very shiny pages with nice glossy pictures. Unfortunately I had to peel every page apart because they seemed to be glued together. Only a few ripped...Anyway, typical TFH- given the beautiful vivariums some people are currently making this is a big letdown. Very little real useful information, what is there is very outdated. Lots of glossy pictures of products (look, an aquarium heater!) and some nice pics of amphibians.Very little good info on setting up aquaterrariums. A lot of the pictures are gravel filled tanks with posters stuck back of beautiful aquariums! Jeeze, who needs to see that?"
1,Terrible,"The provided cam lock hardware is so cheap that it strips when trying to fasten the legs to the shelf. This causes the legs to wobble when weight is placed on the shelf - totally unsafe. I tried to salvage this piece of junk by screwing a large diameter dowel between the two legs as a brace, but it wasn't sufficient. Ended up throwing the whole thing away and returning my center channel speaker. It hurts throwing $75 down the drain!"
4,Well-made and functional,"I purchased this riser so I could set my Samsung 46"" LED TV on it and have the Paradigm center channel speaker positioned underneath. I pre-measured the height of the speaker and it fit, as expected. In fact, there was a 1.5"" gap above the speaker. Makes me want to trim the stand, to lower the TV a bit. Still, we find the viewing angle comfortable, and we get a nice clear sound of the center-channel. We used to have the center speaker directly above our old Sony, resting on top. As a result, the dispersion of the sound was not optimum....now, it is and we notice the difference. The black finish is nice, and the build is VERY solid. We use the extra space under the TV to put the 3D glasses and the Apple TV units. It's like an additional shelf in our entertainment center. Great product. The only thing I remember was waiting a bit over 2 weeks for the delivery, which I thought was a bit long."
3,not what i expected,The book is in fair NOT good condition. Some of the pop-ups are torn or missing and it was scribbled in.The sound works fine.
4,"Great, if dated, information source",This is a wonderful book that brings understanding to visual/cognitive procedures that are usually assumed to be more instinctive than evident.It would be nice to have this classic updated to include form and media from the 20-odd years that have passed since it was published
2,Good info but....,"This book is extraordinarily frustrating. Dondis has so much good information--but it's obscured by what I find to be very poor writing. I found her sentence structure difficult to apprehend, and she's way wordy. Add to that the type face used--all sans serif! There's a reason that almost all books are printed in serif typefaces--and it's not tradition, it's ease of use. How bizarre that a book that is meant to clarify and explicate the use of visual media would employ a user unfriendly font.I've tried to read this book twice, and even have used ideas that I found in that space while teaching a class on art appreciation. I SOOO wish that someone would take the info, rewrite it with sentences that actually flow, and lay it out in a readable font. Anyone up for that? In unleashing some really wonderfully illuminating information, you'd be doing the world much good."
3,Valuable info in bad form,"This book was required for class, so I wasn't expecting it to be incredibly enjoyable; I wasn't wrong. The information is great, and the author obviously knows what she is talking about. The delivery of said information, however, is very dry and dated, and almost gets too academic while you're trying to study art. Know that you need this information, it just might be easier to digest from another source."
4,chaps`,my item arrived on time and in great condition. I had fast service and would gladley do business again with this store.
2,"just for looks, apprears unfinished","These are certainly what you pay for. Made of some type of composite leather and the bottoms aren't even hemmed. They were cut and left as such, and cut uneaven on top of that. I'll be returning them. I wouldn't even use these for looks let alone expect any type of protection from it."
1,Size Chart?,"There may have been a size chart at one time, but there isn't now. Any ideas where to find one?"
3,I love my Leather Chaps,My Leather Chaps keeps my legs warm in cold days that I have to ride my motorcycle. I would recommend them any body that does not have to worry about bad weather often. I live in Texas and our weather is not usually bad. My chaps protect my legs for the water on those rainy days that I have to ride. The leather is thick and made of good quality leather for the money. You really get what you paid for. My snaps broke after 2 rides. I can still wear them and they will keep me protected from the trash out on the road. If you can afford to spend more money I would buy another set of chaps. If you are in a shoe string budget then this are for you. I need to send this to the cleaners and get them fixed.
2,Disappointed,"They ""looked"" okay but aside from that very disappointed. This was definitely a case of you get what you pay for. They didn't have that nice leather smell... More like that awful manure smell. But the worst part was that the leather lacing in the back broke the first day.My advice? Spend the money on a good pair."
2,"Good leather, but...","I was wary about these because of the low price, but the reviews here and on on Jafrum's website persuaded me. When they arrived, my wariness increased. While the leather was high quality, and felt like the $200 pair I outgrew, the zippers and snaps were not. 50 miles into a 600 mile trip, the zipper on the right leg broke. I don't think it would have been too expensive to use good steel YKK zippers, instead of cheap aluminum. Not happy.I gave two stars, because the leather is nice, but the zipper exploding on the highway is something of a deal breaker. Also, if you decide the zipper thing is worth the risk, use the size chart. It's accurate."
3,Chaps,"The service from jafrum is excellent, but the chaps, i've bought it too times and they run a bit small."
4,Fun alternatives to worksheets!,"As a new teacher, I found this book informative and helpful. It gives great ideas as well as specific examples to enhance your classroom. I find the reliance on ""busy work"" and worksheets that some classrooms have destructive to the learning process. These ideas will help keep your students interested and looking forward to coming to school. I'm currently teaching in a first grade classroom, and I've already incorporated several of the ideas."
3,"Helpful, but not the best","This book is ok. I think it offers some good suggestions when you feel ""stuck"" while writing lesson plans. Its good to remember to mix things up and keep kids interested. However, I think ""Classroom Strategies for Interactive Learning"" by Doug Buehl is a better buy with more options and versatility. This strategy book is a little more basic."
5,Great Petty Collection,"Whether you're a beginning guitarist or a pro, there's something in this book that you'll love to play. Each song has chord diagrams plus detailed tablature if you want to play along with Mike Campbell. Everything is easy to read. It contains twenty-three of Petty's classics:American Girl - Breakdown - Don't Come Around Here No More - Don't Do Me Like That - Even The Losers - A Face In The Crowd - Free Fallin' - Here Comes My Girl - I Need To Know - I Won't Back Down - Insider - Into The Great Wide Open - Jammin' Me - Learning To Fly - Listen To Her Heart - Rebels - Refugee - Runnin' Down A Dream - Southern Accents - Stop Draggin' My Heart Around - The Waiting - A Woman In Love (It's Not Me) - You Got LuckyBuy it!"
5,The Best!,"The follow up from part one does a very nice job. Riker is fantastic in dealing with the ways to rescue Picard from the Borg ship. Too bad you couldn't see the actual ""battle"" at Wolf 359. But you actually can if you watch the beginning of Star Trek Deep Space Nine's 1st episode. As with the 1st episode, this one's loaded with suspense. You won't want to miss a minute."
3,"Good, but I've read better from this author...","I did like it, but I didn't find it as captivating as some of her other books, such as Billie's Kiss or The Vintner's Luck (or Dreamhunter/Dreamquake, for that matter). The characters ranged from ""okay"" to ""somewhat interesting"", and I never really felt attached to any of them. The writing was pretty, but didn't make me stop to reread bits like the other books. I hate to say that I was disappointed, because if I hadn't read her other books, I would have really liked this - but my expectations were incredibly high because of how amazing her other books are. Overall, a good read, but I had been hoping for better from this author, just because of the very high standards she had set (with me) based on her other books."
2,Wierd tale #2,"I absolutely adored The Vintner's luck but was very disappointed with this tale of other world creatures. I had trouble connecting the characters or even understanding who was a vampire or who was not. Elizabeth Knox's prose saved the book, for me, from not finishing it."
3,Bold Idea by Picturbook Writing Favorite,"In this first novel, by acclaimed picture book writer, Base (Animelia, The 11th Hour) creates an imaginative world that combines animals and automobiles into such combinations a bulldozer and bulldog. The strength of the world carries the first half of the novel. Some readers might become bored by the plot featuring a band of evil TruckDogs taking over a town. This book, accompanied by twelve gorgeous illustrations should especially appeal to readers who enjoy machines. Base shows some promise as a novelist and this first effort will likely delight some readers with its inventive world and heavy doses of action."
2,TruckDogs,Less than happy with this book. Not the same quality story and graphics as others. Disappointed
3,Leaking Drain,"I bought this cooler about 2 months ago and just recently used it. The drain is leaking and leaking bad. I have tried sealing around the drain with caulking and after 3 applications it is still leaking. I am beginning to think the cap might not fit tight enough and I will have to caulk over the drain to get it stopped. I resent buying something and having to work on it from day one. I am satisfied with the way the cooler cools, but Coleman needs to work on this drain problem. I have talked to others and it seems to be a very common problem with a Coleman Cooler."
3,It is the little things,"The Coleman 58 qt ""Ultimate Extreme"" is a nicely engineered product....BUT....Coleman, of whom I am a great fan of, has gotten cheap on their overall product presentation pride.Why would they think of having an ""Ulitimate Extreme"" with no tray inside, no divider, no way to keep anything out of the slush and hinges that are plastic and suspect?.BACK IN THE DAY... Coleman used to give you a good unit for your dollar. Now they seem to have left the nickels and dimes off of their product, and let the consumer go to the ""parts department""to put together a workable unit.They do make good lanterns.M"
3,"Binoculars Just Fine, but Case Not","These are excellent, small binoculars. I wear them on my belt when traveling. These are my second pair--the case belt loop is very poorly designed--tears easily because the case is thin plastic(that's why I bought another pair)."
1,"Wonderful color great red piping along edges, But:;","The color was just what I was looking for and there was a snappy red piping along the edge. Only almost no fill in the comforter. It felt like two sheets sewn together, maybe they forgot to put in the stuffing. I returned the comforter the next day and purchased a real one with feathers even."
5,Fantastic acapella!,"This album has everything I love about acapella--lots of harmony, with fun arrangements. Some of their earlier albums had mostly copies of pop songs with voices as the instruments, but all the songs on this album are intricate arrangements that show off the great harmony these guys are so good at!"
3,Lumbar support,"This give fairly good lumbar support but I don't really like the ""beans"". I often need to move them around to get it to fit correctly."
4,I have this attached to my office chair,Works good. I dont really think about it anymore which means it's comfortable i guess. I does help me sit up straighter which is a good thing.
5,I use this at work,This is a lifesaver for me since I sit at a computer all day long and find myself slumping by noon. It keeps my back supported which alleviates the pain from becoming unbearable.
2,To bulky and protruding,This is to large and fat making your spine curve way to much. Over curvature one way or another is bad for your spine and can cause the padding in between discs to bulge out making usually your lower extremities numb.
4,good for home and travel,"Most products today you have to blow up- hard to find a Bucky anymore. This replaces one I had for the car which was a small square with a cord to put around your neck, but they don't make those anymore, so am settling for this one."
3,Convenient for Travel but Doesn't Cling onto Seat,"Originally I bought this lumbar support for my office chair, thinking it's the type that will cling set on the chair. I was a little disappointed to learn that it doesn't come with a strap of any kind, so I have to adjust it every time when I sit down. It really is a great product and the buckwheat provides the right amount of firmness that I want - not too soft and not too stiff.Another setback of this order is the pricing - I think it's too overpriced for a little lumbar support like this."
2,disappointing,"As you can see I actually purchased this item (all because of rating, it was 4.5 when I purchased it), I can only say I was really disappointed."
3,"Not for your car, but does offer good support","I was looking for something small to place on my car seat as a lower back support. I drive a sports car so the seats are very uncomfortable and kind of have a low slanting scoop where my lower back is. This is causing me to have extreme back pain so I figured I'd buy this little back support pillow to ease the strain. Although it does provide nice support and is made of buckwheat material, it's too big/bulky for my car seat. I can't drive with something that's this cushioned. I'll have to find another use for it."
2,Not that useful,"I could not keep it in position. If you remove some of the filling, it does not maintain its shape, but if you leave all the filling inside it is too thick and hard. I did not find it useful. I am returning it."
4,It's okay,"The product works, but I use it at school and I move a lot. So I have to re-adjust it every five seconds. It should come with a strap to put it on a chair so it will stay put. Other than that it works well. I can't use it in my car though it puts me too far forawrd."
1,Stinks,"No way to attach this to an office chair, needs a bungie cord or something. Might work in the car, but it's just not large enough to really make any kind of a difference in comfort, unless you want it for your butt."
2,This one's going back,"The pictures are beautiful, but I didn't like the story at all. There was no rhythm or rhyme to the words, and the story was disjointed and unconnected. Not sure what the author was trying to do here ..."
3,"Peaceful bedtime counting book, not a storybook","This is a quiet, peaceful book. There's no story, really, just counting. 10 silent houses; 9 trees; 8 leaves; 7 stars; 6 fish; 5 clouds; 4 peaches; 3 foxes; 2 water lilies; 1 swan. ""Here you are, almost sleeping"" ""Sweet dreams."" Each page has good descriptive language for the objects being counted. A good book to read last at bedtime."
4,Five stories - one theme,"In many ways, The Tainted Relic is five separate novellas all created with a single theme. An interesting concept, five different writers each take a period of time and then build a story around an alleged splinter of Jesus' cross that is stained with his blood. An invaluable possession in the medieval period of the stories, it carries with it a curse that leaves everyone that comes in contact with it dead. The stories are loosely connected across time, and provide for some good casual reading."
4,An Rough Read,"This book is very uneven and at times almost painful to read. I would have appreciated the author's names being listed with each short story. If I am understanding the layout correctly, it would appear that Susanna Gregory is the author of Act Four - the story that I found most tedious. This is surprising since I generally like what she writes under her Simon Beauford pseudonym. I would not recommend to other than the most dedicated mystery medieval history fans."
3,Coleman 30x60 folding table,"For quick set up in home for puzzles, family gatherings, etc. it is perfect. Support for the table is on both ends. The middle is supported by the middle hinge, which will sag, and may fail if a lot of weight is put on the table. I made a wooden leg for the center to slip under the table after setting it up and it is sturdy with this setup. My leg is 3'4""x1"" and has a 1 1/2"" foot glued on. The top has a 3/16"" slot to catch the lip of the hinge under the table. Without the leg, I would only trust the table with things such as chips. If you want a heavy duty table, this is not for you. I like mine for what I bought it for.Busy Bee"
1,Flimsy table,"I have an aluminum table that has been in the family for well over 30 years and has been heavily used. I thought this table was the same quality since the picture is the same as my old table and it was described as aluminum. This table is very flimsy. When you unfold it to set it up, the top pieces don't match so you have a gap in the middle of the table top. I expected better of Coleman."
2,"Eh, it's decent, but not the best","I bought this to place craft items on to sell at a craft show. I was a bit disappointed in the quality. The top of the table is metal -- a very thin metal. When placing heavier items on the table, the thin metal ""dips"" in a bit. Also, the table is not that sturdy. A couple features I did appreciate was the size of the table and the ease of transit. Fits well into a trunk. Saying that, it's decent, but not the best. Had I known the top of the table was so flimsy, I would have paid extra for a plastic composite top."
3,Good for what it's for,"It's lightweight, easy to lug around, convenient to store and does what I need it to do. It was also fairly cheap. I don't know that I'd trust it to hold anything too heavy (definitely wouldn't stand on it for example) but for a poker game or a tailgate I think it would be perfect."
1,TERRIBLE PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!,"I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables. They were not only expensive to ship, but one arrived damaged. The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully, meaning that people's drinks would slide off the table. These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered. If it weren't for the replacement tables I found at costco, the party I planned would have been a disaster."
4,Good value,"We got four of these tables last year for our Summer Party and have been using them regularly. None of them arrived damaged and all had functioned well. We weren't expecting stainless steel sturdiness (on the contrary they are light and easy to transport, set-up) so we were not disappointed by their ""filmsiness"". This year's party will be bigger, so we are purchasing four more."
4,"good service, but the product is liitle different than what I thought","the table has Aluminum legs, but the plat form is made of some kind of paper board. but if you don't put too much weight on it, it's pretty good."
3,"Coleman Dynasty 30x60"" Folding Table",The first delivery of 2 tables arrived damaged. One I kept- the damage wasn't severe. The other was returned and a good replacement arrived promptly. This table was not as sturdy as I expected. If you use it for light weight items it will be serviceable.I needed extra seating for a large dinner party. The table will seat 6 comfortably.
2,Not tall enough for dining table,This table is not appropriate for sitting at - it is only up to knee-height (which isn't made explicitly clear on the advertising)
3,Coleman's Dynasty Table,This table is great for easy storage & carrying. I would recommend this product.
3,not too happy,"The product was a good idea, but when i received the item, it had a hole in it. I was not going to pay to ship it back, so we just kept it. Things happen i suppose."
4,Great Ground Work!,"This book provides a good spiritual basis to address very personal issues in an interactive setting. With a few basic ground rules, it sets a standard where issues can be resolved in a non-threatening and productive environment."
2,homebuilders couples series - building your marraige,"unfortunately, without a picture, and no information regarding publishing date online, the copy was very outdated. this series has been around awhile, and this copy looks to be an original! i appreciate the discounted price (the reason to purchase in this venue). i purchased several copies, but this one is outdated and looks it. i can't give it out in my group."
1,Avoid! Avoid!,"I was looking for something new to listen to so I picked this up, not at all familiar with this new comedian. Boy am I disappointed. The audience is obviously having a good time, but I wasn't. I don't want to sound like a grouch for giving a comedy CD a low grade, but this was annoying and offensive. I'm a big fan of George Carlin and Margaret Cho so I am into off-color humor, but there was no comic payoff in this junk. Track #13 and #14 were most insulting. I guess making a target out of gay people is a big joke to some people. Whatever.And I am NOT easily offended. It just seemed more mean-spirited than comical."
2,slow motion,I did not like the cd it could have better songs on it. I could have made a better cd. It is not worth the price.
4,Sultry and sexy,This is a sultry and sexy cd bringing very deep thoughts and feelings. I love it but its not for kids.
3,the lost kittens,well i already told u guys that the album it self was lackin something like a little snopp puppy or sumthing well the track i swear was actually pretty good for setting the sexual mood/preferencenow im gona have a snack guys so il talk to yal llater keep doin yo thangPEACE<3 DANNY
4,This one could have been better.,"This 1987 release from Oscar D'Leon is quite good despite having two filler tracks. The opener ""Juntos Pa'Gozar"" features a very strong underlying Bomba rhythm and Oscar's venerable skills as a first-rate Salsa sonero are given the spotlight on this very fun and danceable tune. The Cuban Son Montuno-influenced numbers ""Retosandito"", ""Ponte A Bailar"" and ""Sale A Buscar"" find Oscar truly in his element and are clearly this album's high points while the Bolero Son ""Es Decir Que Eres Linda"" offers a nice change of pace. The two filler tracks are the title track (a strange hybrid of Merengue and 1980s Electro-Funk dance music!) and the closing track ""Todo Termino"" (which is neither great nor disastrous)."
3,The wrong instrument !,"This recording of the complete Organ Works of Maurice Duruflé is actually very well performed , exspecially the Veni Creator Spiritus , where he works with the choir , but unfortunatly the organ (a Gigantic British romantic organ ) is not compatible with Duruflés quite romantic organ pieces . Exspacially the Prelude and Fuge does not build up the way it could , and the Toccata from the Suite just does not have the power as for examle Bernard Leonardys recording from St.Eustache or Olivier Latrys recording from St.Ouen , Rouen (this I must say is my favorite recording) has. Too bad he didn't choose a great Cavaillé-Coll Organ for this project ."
3,"decent performance, bad sound","The performances on this disc are generally good but the engineering is muffled and distant. Even in a good room recording choral and organ music is extremely difficult to do well. The loud passages are quite loud and the quiet passages are hard to make out, especially with all the detailed passages Durufle liked to write. The Veni Creator performance threw me off a lot by having a men's choir intone each succeeding verse of the chant between variations. BIG SURPRISE, and not a pleasant one since I'd already noted how fuzzy and distant much of the recording sounded and how hard it was to make out the counterpoint. A much better engineered recording is the Todd Wilson recording where all the counterpoint comes through and the Veni Creator variations are heard as one seamless piece, more likely what Durufle wanted. The performances here aren't bad (except for the disruptive idea of the singing), they just deserved better engineering."
3,Great Idea Extremely Poorly Executed,"This could have been a fantastic game if the physics weren't so horrible. The top ""paddle"" only seems to work when you accidently hit the ball when you don't want to. There are times when the top paddle doesn't work at all. If the game wasn't so wonky, this would have been a great game. The fact when the ball goes from the top screen all of a sudden to the bottom screen it is difficult to track the ball. This should have been made into a one screen game. The dual screen just doesn't work. I'd wait to buy a used version if I had waited."
4,"Discover or rediscover ""I married Joan""","Joan Davis (radio comedian) plays an empty-headed house wife. Jim Backus (Peter Bowers in ""Boys' Night Out"") plays the husband, Judge Bradley Stevens (1952-1955) (38 episodes, 1952-1955).Each episode is a wholly contained story that starts out sane and logical. As time go on unlikely elements creep in to make the situation hysterically ridicules. Eventually everything is wrapped up. The actors and their characters is what make this comedy work so well.Disk 1:Prize FighterWall SafeJoan's HaircutChanging HousesTalent ScoutBad BoyDisk 2:HoneymoonHome MoviesNew HouseNeighborsAlterationSister PatMy Little Margie - DVD Collection #1"
4,Queen of TV Comedy,"I agree with other reviewers that Joan Davis is a superb comedienne, sadly forgotten. She's at the top of the list along with Tracy Ullman and Carol Burnett. The underrated and very talented Jim Backus was a wonderful foil. Funny in his own right, he was also a solid dramatic actor. See ""Rebel Without a Cause."" I wish they would give a fully restored release treatment on dvd of ""I Married Joan."" Comedy tends to date but there are a lot of examples of 1950s comedy series that don't. ""I Married Joan"" is at the top of this list."
3,"Amazon, it's not your fault!","I love Joan Davis, always have. I was disappointed in this DVD because the funniest episodes were not chosen. It opened with a tedious, ridiculous, confusing and very un-funny episode, featuring Joan as a boxing manager. I remember hilarious episodes like ""The Mozambique Purple,"" and the one where Joan takes an animal on the bus and the bus driver ""compliments"" Joan on her ""baby's"" appearance! I wish they'd chosen these."
5,Highly Functional Product.,"Excellent product for sealing all sorts of bags or holding materials (films, fabrics, etc.) in place."
5,clip-n-seal bag clips,I love these clips! I ordered 3 different sizes and I couldn't be more pleased. They are so easy to work with and they actually work extremely well.
3,Not for large warehouse store paper bags,"I bought these for the large flour, rice, etc bags that one finds at warehouse stores. Unfortunately these clips are too tight to use over the pleated margins of these bags where four layers of thick paper overlap. For plastic bags they work great, although you will need strong hands/fingers."
3,Good for price! Better ones around..,"It works. You have to place the thick plastic rod under the folded bag crease and snap the C shaped plastic snap cover over it.Pros- good for price.Cons- Thick plastic and somewhat difficult to use. Not handy to use for all types of bagsAlternatives- Gripstics. I got these first, liked them and wanted to buy more. However the prices were much more than listed now (got them 4 mo's ago) and bought the Clip and seals instead. The Gripstics are easier to use and more aesthetically structured.Verdict- If value for price, get these. If value for ease of use, look again.."
2,be careful,"The shoe is exactly what I ordered, and I knew what I wanted when I went looking for it. The problem was that when it arrived the Leather did not match. One one shoe it was pristine and on the other it looked like it had been worn for a month or two. You get what you pay for and I did get a pretty good deal on them, I would have returned them if not for shipping costs, I can still tell that they are not the same ( I had hoped with wear you wouldnt be able to tell) someone that did not know probably could not tell so it all depends on how picky you are I guess."
5,More comfortable than sneakers,This is the second pair of these I bought--I also have them in black. They are amazingly comfortable. You forgot you have them on. Well worth the price!
5,The best shoes ever,Merrell shoes are not only comfortable but they last forever. I have bought four pairs of shoes over the last ten years and wear them everyday. They are a bargain at this price.
5,A great read.,"In my personal experience, I have met a number of Catholics who are unenlightened and unthoughtful, and many who are. Higgins certainly fits in with the latter. He is a man of intellect and integrity whose works do not warrant such harsh criticism. He is without a doubt a brilliant theologian, and his ideas cannot be dismissed by such ad hominem attacks. He is deeply pious but also reasonable, and if there is anyone who truly represents the ideal of Catholicism, it is Higgins."
3,Looks Cool...,"Not Being a full Blown Gear head I have not wired everyting yet, especially since the car is a bad yard build from someone else. Actually wiring this would not ne hard it is untangling the existing mess and figuring what I need and don't need."
1,NO ME HA LLEGADO MI PAQUETE,LO CATALOGO DE UN MAL SERVICIO POR QUE NI EL TRACKING ME HAN ENVIADO Y QUIERO MI PEDIDO POR QUE HACE 10 DIAS QUE DEBIO DE LLEGAR Y NO HA LLEGADO
3,Not as durable as bedrock.,"My oldest loves the Flintstones and was delighted to receive the car with the Flintstones and the Rebels. However, the characters are glued together. It is a model. It was never intended for anyone to play with the figures or the car. As a model, it is cute and detailed. As a toy, not durable for prolong play."
1,Overpowering scent makes this pen unusable for me,"I was looking for a cheaper replacement for my rather pricy Sephora cuticle oil pen and found this one online. The overwhelming ""citrusy"" scent is unreal. If you are remotely sensitive to various fragrances/perfumes, then I would suggest you forget this pen and get the Sephora one (has little or no added fragrance). I really don't get why product manufacturers have to add perfume/fragrance to so many beauty supplies that really don't require such additives....mabye to cover the unpleasant scent of the natural ingredients? In any case, I cannot use this product since the fragrance is way too much for me."
4,Education-oriented vs research-oriented?,"A previous reviewer says this book describes the Cold War conversion of Stanford University ""from an education-oriented to [a] research-oriented institution"". Might just note that both Stanford's founder and its first president held strongly expressed views that research -- particularly including quite applied research -- was an essential element of university education. Stanford was research-oriented, as an essential part of being education-oriented, from day one, in 1891."
1,a lousy pompous rotten book,"This book is really really really bad - just trust me. Dont even bother reading this review any further, or thinking about it. It is so bad that it prompted me to write."
5,"Excellent, entertaining and worth every penny","I rented this online from Amazon, desperate on a bad day to have something for my kid to watch. My kids love all the Signing Time videos- asks for them multiple times a day, and I had none with us that day. Video quality could be improved upon, but it was sufficient for our purposes at the time. I'm glad I didn't pay more than $2 for the rental though."
3,Not as good,My daughter LOVES the Baby Sign Language 1 and 2 tapes but this one she really is not interested in at all. The songs are not as fun and much more repetative. I am glad to learn the new signs but most of the signs on this one are not as useable as in the first and second videos.
2,Not as entertaining as Vols. 1 and 2,"We bought this for our son for his 1st birthday. We already own Vols. 1 and 2, and our son has picked up many signs from those two editions. He loves to watch those, so we purchased this one to add to the collection. He will watch this one for 5 minutes, tops. It is boring, and the tunes repeat throughout the video. Stick to Vols. 1 and 2...skip this one. Its a huge disappointment."
5,Baby signing time,All the videos are excellent. We started showing our daughter right after she turned 1 and it has helped so much. My husband and I realize that she is learning and understanding a lot because she uses the signs to communicate with us. I think it would be a lot more difficult to gauge her abilities without it. Signing has been a wonderful tool to communicate before she can form all words
5,GREAT DVD!!! Baby Signing Time 3,"My 19-month-old signs ""baby"" when he wants to watch this DVD (which is often)! The content is fun, educational, and gets both the parents and baby interested and thinking! The music is exceptional and we all enjoy watching and learning."
5,Wonderful,The four Baby Signing Time DVDs I have purchased have all been wonderful. My daughter watches them over and over.
5,As great as Vol 1 and 2,"I was hesitant to buy Vol 3 (and 4) because I read the songs were not as good, but my husband and I were going bonkers if we had to watch vol 1 and 2 again (we have watched them hundreds of times). My son loves them but he is growing bored of the same videos and isn't interested in any other movies or TV shows. We bought 3 (and 4) and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE vol. 3. The songs are super catchy. The pace is a tad faster than vol. 1 and 2 and the concepts are a tad older (it is weather related) but nothing too advanced. I definitely recommend if your child/children love the other volumes."
3,oh Rachel what have you done?,"This just isn't as good as Baby Signing Time one or two. The lyrics are more repetitive and the tunes more irritating. The signs are useful, but you could probably teach them to your child without the DVD and save yourself some cash and disappointment. Most hated lyrics include: ""a new day for you day, a new day for me day, a can't wait to see day, a da da li do day"" also ""I'm creepy crawly and very small - ee"". Maybe the first two just set the bar really high, but if you have any musical sensibilities and are into these DVD's I would skip this one and stick to 1,2, and 4."
